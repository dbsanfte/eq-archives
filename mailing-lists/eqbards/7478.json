There was zero useful<br/>\ninfo on how the classes broke down.  I picked a class that I thought would<br/>\nbe fun.  It is fun.  I do enjoy my class.  Do I get frustrated by seemingly<br/>\narbitrary things my class does not have?  Absolutely.  Would I play this<br/>\nclass knowing everything I know now if I had not grown attached to the<br/>\ncharacter that is Kitasi?  Probably not, doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t enjoy Kitasi<br/>\nbut if some bug rendered him unrecoverable I am not sure I would start up<br/>\nanother bard without some changes having been made.  Not sure what class<br/>\nwould fit my image better, an enchanter maybe, gotta love any spell that<br/>\nallows me to do more quests which only leaves enchanters and bards.  Hard to<br/>\nsay, but just because I am having fun doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t see room for<br/>\nimprovement.  After all the reverse argument must hold true if the primary<br/>\none does.  If binding is not such a big deal, then why don&#39;t all the classes<br/>\neventually get it at some level.  Point is, it is a big deal, just a big<br/>\ndeal that has been arbitrarily assigned to some classes and not others<br/>\nbecause of some idea of a world system.  Not necessarily bad in most cases,<br/>\nbut I think it is in this case.  If I lived in Hawaii like some on this list<br/>\nI would despair of ever getting bound in my what would be my prime playing<br/>\nhours.  You better know someone real well who can bind and you would<br/>\nprobably be restricted to playing with those people where those people<br/>\nwanted to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 5:14 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Question...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nis anyone happy with the classes they play?  besides me i guess.  you do<br/>\nknow all of these particular things were in effect since the game came out.<br/>\ndid you expect them to change?<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; \tNo bind, not a caster class<br/>\n&gt; \tNo Parry, not a melee class<br/>\n&gt; \tNo special weapons, not a hybrid class<br/>\n&gt; \tetc., etc., etc. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
