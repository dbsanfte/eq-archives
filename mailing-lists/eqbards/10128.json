What I was asking about is<br/>\nthe wording of the original message, which reads &quot;I did mention about snare<br/>\nbreaks root, but should have mentioned it can kill Darkness line DOTs&quot;.  The<br/>\nintent of my followup post was to clarify if the original poster meant to<br/>\ntype &quot;chain breaks root&quot; versus &quot;snare breaks root&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; If a ranger or druid snares a mob and then you decide to chain it for<br/>\n&gt; whatever reason, the chain song being last in will strip or break or<br/>\n&gt; over-ride the snare.  Same for root.  The same goes for the darkness spell<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt; but there my SK cousin yells at me because it canceled also the hp degrade<br/>\n&gt; effects too.
