Basically I give up getting<br/>\ndecent EXP for the chance of obtaining a nice item.  I got my gloomwater<br/>\nharpoon and shark tooth in Kedge that way.  I was in a group of five other<br/>\n45+ people.  After four hours of killing stuff that was always red to me, my<br/>\nEXP bar had hardly moved.  Bard hate hasn&#39;t been much of a factor either<br/>\nsince the damage they are inflicting is far outweighing the taunts from my<br/>\nsongs.  After combats I&#39;ve been ending up at almost full health.  I&#39;m hoping<br/>\nthat will be the case when I get close to 40.  If a mid 40s group camping<br/>\nthe Lord will have me then I&#39;ll give it a shot.  The good thing is that by<br/>\nthe time I get to 40, a lot of my guild mates will be in their mid 40s and<br/>\nlikely trying to get Ykeshas themselves so we can help each other out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; and wouldn&#39;t ykesha camping be more like mid 40s?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The key question<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is that by the time I can camp for Ykeshas (late 30s/early <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 40s), will the +9<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DEX increase the number of procs by enough to outweigh the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; benefit of having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; +5 to all resist rates? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Whats a good price if I decide to sell the Exe Hood? <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
