A few levels<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maybe 15-20 lizards behind me.  Then I hit the maze.  The maze is just that,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I got lost.  While frantically searching for the way out, I&#39;m getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hit by lizards that I blaze past and picking them up in turn.  Well by the<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not really sure this is possible if you&#39;re alone.  If you<br/>\n&gt; wade into a 5+ mob camp with your AOE songs going, you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; notice only 4 of them will attack you at a time.  The rest<br/>\n&gt; will stay where they are and ignore you until one of the mobs<br/>\n&gt; attacking you dies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I suppose it could be that if they&#39;re all chasing you, then<br/>\n&gt; none of them are attacking you, so all of them can chase<br/>\n&gt; you.
