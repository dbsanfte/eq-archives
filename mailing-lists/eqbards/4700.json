My friend tinen (lvl 41 <br/>\n&gt; bard) got the<br/>\n&gt; arms since we where randoming everything that was obtained between the<br/>\n&gt; classes that could use them. Me and tinen nearly fell over <br/>\n&gt; laughing when we<br/>\n&gt; found the first bard only item since we where the only 2 <br/>\n&gt; bards. But alas,<br/>\n&gt; he got the first item, and we didnt find anymore for the <br/>\n&gt; night since we<br/>\n&gt; gated out shortly after that. All of this was on the first <br/>\n&gt; day, before they<br/>\n&gt; made it supposedly harder. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
