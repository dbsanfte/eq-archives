Sounded like a great off hand<br/>\nweapon to me, better yet its a whip that cracks every 2 seconds much to the<br/>\nagony of my group (big grin), but then again I&#39;m a sucker for procs (hence I<br/>\nactually would admit to desperately wanting Crookstinger, but I saw another<br/>\npoisoning weapon drops in splitpaw too...a 10/38 1hs strong poison).  Its<br/>\nnot lore, so who knows I might try and get another to REALLY liven things up<br/>\nwith the sound of whip cracking rawhide.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem:  my will is insufficient. :P<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else got one and know what level it starts making mobs REALLY mad at<br/>\nme?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Tork@Nameless&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
