","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1546505071\">I agree and disagree.  I don&#39;t think we should &quot;Fight&quot; a battle to get<br/>\nlullaby to work on level 1 snakes - I think we need to fight to get songs<br/>\nthat help us.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Our friends who&#39;s level let them fight 30- mobs as blues need to take the<br/>\nstatistics and show they are getting higher resists with higher Charisma.<br/>\nLet&#39;s face it - we have good reason to believe that sign is reversed.  Let&#39;s<br/>\nhelp out the people at those levels get a Lullaby that works (or prove us<br/>\nwrong - unlike Verant - I&#39;m happy to admit when I&#39;m wrong!)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Okay - I&#39;m 48.  I would assume (could be wrong - but make them say<br/>\nthat) - our &quot;Upgrade&quot; songs should work at least until we are high enough<br/>\nlevel to get the next &quot;Upgrade&quot; song.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to use Pixie strike to get keep a single mob mezzed - and the<br/>\nresists are so bad it&#39;s not useful.  Lets DO PIXIE STRIKES ON THOSE LEVEL 1<br/>\nMOBS!  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll still see the bad resists...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Wasserman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 08, 2000 11:16 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Official confirmation from Ester<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, there it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have 2 options. Roll over and die or Fight it. As a bard, I&#39;ve had more<br/>\nthan my share of dying, so I say we fight it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far several issues are unaddressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey said it&#39;s &quot;working as intended&quot; but they haven&#39;t told us what intended<br/>\nis. We need to press them to find out what the expected resist rates are so<br/>\nwe can do our own testing. All we know is that the song is supposed to be<br/>\nmore effective vs mobs below level 30. Let&#39;s hammer that datapoint until we<br/>\ncan prove to them that they are wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing abashi said is that he did a test personally and found that<br/>\nresist rates on mobs below 30 conform to GZ&#39;s statement on resist rates. I<br/>\nthink we need to increase the sample size and prove him wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I propose...<br/>\nI&#39;d like everyone to spend 5 minutes in your local newbie area singing<br/>\nLullaby to snakes, bats, rats, decaying skeletons, or whatever level 1<br/>\ncritter you can find. Log the results and we&#39;ll start a thread to post them<br/>\non. If we all do this every night, we&#39;ll get a huge sample size that will<br/>\nacurately show the resist rates. Make sure you post your bard&#39;s level as<br/>\nwell as the log file.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we keep the pressure on, perhaps they will realize their error.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nMinstel of Norrath<br/>\nTribunal Server<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
