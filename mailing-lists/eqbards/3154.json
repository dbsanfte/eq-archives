The captain is level 30 or so and he always spawns<br/>\nwith help so its a tough battle.  Just as we pulled the captain the last<br/>\ntime last night, our magician went linkdead and our two large bodies started<br/>\nbanging on the wrong bodies.  The officer that came with the captain<br/>\ndispatched one of our members in short work and had the other one down to a<br/>\nbubble of health (and I hadn&#39;t even put a dent in the captain yet!). I<br/>\nyelled the run command, gave my mostly dead ogre friend a head start and<br/>\nthen it hit me, why should I get stunned all the way out of the dungeon?!? I<br/>\nturned on Lullaby and we ran out.  Every time a monster got close in the<br/>\ntrain we created on that run, their head would nod. I got hit only twice on<br/>\nthe whole run and saved one party members life! Of course, I would never<br/>\nhave tried it if Najena was an outdoorsy type of place. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, one side effect I realized as I ran is that my song did get ALL the<br/>\nmonsters I passed on my tail, even the ones that were green enough that they<br/>\nhad stopped attacking me on sight.  It could backfire if you don&#39;t know the<br/>\nzone very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\n24th level bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
