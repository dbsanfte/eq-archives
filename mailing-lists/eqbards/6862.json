(by a factor of 5 or 6, west Karana is BIG)  You need to  <br/>\n     climb the west wall around the undead area near the zone border and <br/>\n     have accelardo going since you occasionally get attacked there but I <br/>\n     always made it to zone NP.  (scout the route ahead of time so you know <br/>\n     the way) In  S. Karana you are so close to the village and most the of <br/>\n     mobs are non-aggro that getting your body is very easy.  The only real <br/>\n     danger is running into a named frogie in the water of rath lake.  It <br/>\n     is a very rare event (never happened to me) but I suggest having your <br/>\n     swimming trained up and play acccelardo while you swim just in case.  <br/>\n     It takes over 20 minutes to run to the aviak village from Qeynos (even <br/>\n     with a drum) where the arena is only about 2 minutes away.  No <br/>\n     question in my mind, get bound in the arena.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     another hint, you can sell you stuff at the centaur village in the NE <br/>\n     corner of S. Karana.  Saves that long run back to Qeynos to sell.  Now <br/>\n     if the centaurs only had a bank...  )<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold 20th (the slowest leveler in EQ)<br/>\n     Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] What to do with a level 24?<br/>\nAuthor:  Non-HP-g4mntofcr (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>) at <br/>\nHP-ColSprings,shargw5<br/>\nDate:    9/20/99 2:46 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n     <br/>\nFor bards who hunt in South Karana, is it best to get bound in the Arena or <br/>\nin Qeynos?  The Arena may be quicker in terms of getting back to your corpse <br/>\nbut you won&#39;t have a flute to sing invis song (to avoid getting attacked as <br/>\nyou run back to your corpse).  Is this something I should be concerned with <br/>\nor will the wandering mobs in SK leave me alone?<br/>\n     <br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n     <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Also if you are hunting Aviaks you want to have a Ranger in your group.  <br/>\n&gt; Since on my server (Karana) the Treehouse is majorly camped, but there are <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; many wandering Avaiks in the area between the Treehouse and Paw.  When I <br/>\n&gt; used to slow there I would just zoom around with Selo&#39;s till I found one. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This was still quicker (and more fun) then fighting over the static spawn <br/>\n&gt; at <br/>\n&gt; the Treehouse :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Myself and another bard on my server, seem to be doing well in South <br/>\n&gt; Karana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fighting Aviaks in and around the Aviak City... We can solo Darters and <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rooks, and in groups we can take harriers and Avocets, these things are <br/>\n&gt; &gt;rich<br/>\n&gt; &gt;also.
