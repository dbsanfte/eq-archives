Mob spawns, attacks druid, druid<br/>\nfights back, 20 seconds later a second mob spawns, druid is<br/>\nhaving trouble getting spells off, 30 seconds later a third<br/>\nmob spawns, druid is still fighting the first mob and quickly<br/>\ndrops below half hp, I ask if she needs help.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine and her group were in the barroom in Unrest,<br/>\nwith a couple people camping the knight upstairs.  Apparently<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t interested in anything but the knight as they let<br/>\neverything else run down (LOS bug) to her group.  She got fed<br/>\nup with it and just invised her group.  Knight spawns, two<br/>\npeople upstairs drop their invis to attack, entire barroom<br/>\nruns upstairs to attack them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to get into dirty tricks, our AE songs will blow<br/>\npeople&#39;s invisibility (people not grouped with you).
