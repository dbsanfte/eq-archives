If you sing<br/>\nClouding while anyone in your group is camoed or invised, they<br/>\nare visible (not to you but to the mobs) every time your song<br/>\npulses.  This is pretty easy to demonstrate - have a group<br/>\nmember cast invis on you while you are singing clouding.  <br/>\nTarget a far-away mob and /con it repeatedly.  Every time your<br/>\nsong pulses, it can see you and the /con message will change.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
