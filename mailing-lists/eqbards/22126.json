The lute strings<br/>\n&gt;required a little fine tuning but it wasn&#39;t too hard to get back in the<br/>\n&gt;swing of things.  One thing I did have trouble with was using this song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I had just dinged into 39 when I stopped playing the first time.  So I <br/>\n&gt;never<br/>\n&gt;had the opportunity to use this song.  Here is the problem I had.  Group<br/>\n&gt;would pull two mobs and I would charm the second one.  I would get the eyes<br/>\n&gt;glaze over message.  I would then target the first mob and give the /pet<br/>\n&gt;attack command.  Problem is my pet just stood there and did not attack.  I<br/>\n&gt;kept hitting /pet attack on several occasions but I could never get it to<br/>\n&gt;work.  In this situation, the mob we were attacking never attacked me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So then later on I tried it again.  Different scenario this time.  Puller<br/>\n&gt;agrroed two mobs and snared one.  So the second mob took longer to arrive <br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;the party.  I was attacking first mob, buffing party etc before the second<br/>\n&gt;mob got there.  I charmed second mob when it arrived, initial mob attacked<br/>\n&gt;me, and then my pet responded and started attacking the first mob.  After<br/>\n&gt;charm wore off and I recharmed it, it automatically attacked the first mob<br/>\n&gt;again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not certain why I could not get my charmed mob to attack in the first<br/>\n&gt;situation.  Besides the mana drain, is there a difference how the 39 charm<br/>\n&gt;works compared to the original version?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
