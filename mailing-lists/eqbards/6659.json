I know a little about networking but<br/>\nnot enough to know why all the router problems seem to occur with Cerfnet<br/>\nwhile UUNet always seems to work fine.  I assume that these are two<br/>\ncompanies that work similar to ISPs and that Verant has a support contract<br/>\nwith them.  What I&#39;m wondering is if the problems are based on the type of<br/>\nrouter the company is using (i.e. Cisco vs some other company) or is it a<br/>\ninternal operational problem (i.e. the UUNet people know how to do their<br/>\njobs better than the Cerfnet people)?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;That&#39;s possible.  I didn&#39;t check the lag meter, but I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;coping with 10%-30% PL most of the time for the last three<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;weeks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s been BAD! Wave after wave of linkdeads, and it is happening to<br/>\n&gt; friends<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with cable modems as well as with my dial up connection. I have been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wondering if it was regional (Austin) or further upstream. Sounds like<br/>\n&gt; trhe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; latter<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That 10%-30% is with a cable modem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Early yesterday afternoon after slogging through more of the<br/>\n&gt; same PL for an hour, something hiccupped dumping about a third<br/>\n&gt; of the players off the servers.  When I got back on there was<br/>\n&gt; a message saying they were looking into the PL problem.  For<br/>\n&gt; the next half hour, I had 0%-3% PL.  Then they took the<br/>\n&gt; servers down (presumably to fix the PL), and when I got back<br/>\n&gt; on it was at 10%-30% again.  I fired off a feedback<br/>\n&gt; complaining about it.  My friends in Toronto, Minnesota, and<br/>\n&gt; California are reporting the same thing so I think the problem<br/>\n&gt; is at or near Verant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
