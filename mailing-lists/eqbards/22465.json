I noticed that in-game, you cannot add bindings like <br/>\n&gt;shift-numpad#, or alt-numpad#, but it supports it, you just have to change <br/>\n&gt;it in the ini file.  Also, in game (at the keyboard mappings page), you <br/>\n&gt;left click on the first binding spot, and to access the second binding <br/>\n&gt;spot, right click on it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;An important thing to note....be sure you unbind any keys that are using <br/>\n&gt;SHIFT-NUMPAD#....else the game will execute both commands at the same <br/>\n&gt;time.   (Oh yeah...I&#39;m using &quot;bind&quot; to refer to keyboard <br/>\n&gt;assignments...it&#39;s an old Quake habit of mine :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also noticed some stuff that they didn&#39;t put in the patch message.<br/>\n&gt;1) They moved CTRL-# casting to ALT-# casting (too near the Winblows <br/>\n&gt;key)  (but this can be rebound to ctrl-#)<br/>\n&gt;2) ALT-casting now works for Bards<br/>\n&gt;3) A lot of the / commands (like /sit /camp) now work while we&#39;re singing <br/>\n&gt;songs.<br/>\n&gt;4) You can use one hot key bank for your full inventory and two slots from <br/>\n&gt;your equipment list (like melee 1 and 2)...since you can open backpacks in <br/>\n&gt;full screen mode, there&#39;s no reason to go to the inventory screen now.<br/>\n&gt;5) there&#39;s a bunch more keyboard shortcuts like CTRL-B for spellbook, <br/>\n&gt;CTRL-D for disband, CTRL-I for invite/follow, CTRL-S for sitting/standing, <br/>\n&gt;etc...check your keyboard mappings in game, or read the ini file : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Couple more things that I like about the patch...the turning off attacking <br/>\n&gt;on autoassisting (our cleric tends to un-mez every mob sometimes when <br/>\n&gt;she&#39;s trying to heal :)   Since I&#39;m so used to using 6 keys for spells, <br/>\n&gt;etc, I can use the next four keys for my weapons and inventory (I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;compulsive about always knowing what I have in my hands...this way I can <br/>\n&gt;see it on all my hotkey banks : )     108 new socials means we can do a <br/>\n&gt;lot of fun stuff  (for you jokesters...get someone to make you a suit of <br/>\n&gt;brown plate armor...then run around poking ppl and saying &quot;Can&#39;t catch me <br/>\n&gt;&#39;cause I&#39;m the Gingerbread Man!&quot;  (hehe...or Woman : )).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, I&#39;ve talked enough....happy hunting!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--Khelan, happy on Tarew Marr.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
