It&#39;s true.  I&#39;m in a high level<br/>\nguild with a lot of people that have two and some even three level 50 (or<br/>\nhigh 40s) characters.  I would say that around 8 people in my guild have<br/>\nconfessed that they started a bard character and gave it up in their teens<br/>\nor early 20s.  &quot;I die too much.&quot;  &quot;Those songs are too big of a taunt.&quot;  &quot;I<br/>\ncan&#39;t solo a bard.&quot;  &quot;I couldn&#39;t believe how few hitpoints I had.&quot;  &quot;Mana<br/>\nsong at 32?  Geez that&#39;s a long wait.&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s the only character I&#39;ve ever<br/>\nstarted that had to run to guards from a snake at level 1. (this one was<br/>\nreally said to me)&quot;  Etc., etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying a bard of any level is hard work and should be commended.  It&#39;s a<br/>\nvery fun and original class that is really unlike any of the others, but as<br/>\nwe&#39;ve said on this list countless times, we do die a lot and generally level<br/>\nvery slowly...
