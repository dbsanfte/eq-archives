If 125 doesnt do anything, but 225 does?<br/>\n  I dunno, Vox was standing right on top of me almost, and with my<br/>\n  crappy cold resistance, I absorbed at least 300% of the dmg.  <br/>\n  Instead of taking 600ish like I could tell my party members did,<br/>\n  I ate less than 200.  Plus her DragonRoar didn&#39;t do jack to me.<br/>\n  I just stood there, heh.  I had no buffs on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wouldn&#39;t they be ice-based spells, where mystic shielding is MR only?  my<br/>\n&gt; wiz has a frost shock spell at level 24 and an ice shock spell at 34.  i&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; assuming they would cast something like that being ice goblin wizzies.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Shock of Force.  150ish dmg, stun, mostly resisted outright, but<br/>\n  when I took a hit, it was 125ish dmg with over 100 MR.  That truly<br/>\n  hurt me to see a L20 caster nuking me for almost full.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sounds like you are =P<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Well, ok I am ;-)  It&#39;s just too coincidental that all the things<br/>\n  I&#39;ve seen just don&#39;t add up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; equipment/spell/song wise to get both MR and CR/FR both over 200.  i dunno<br/>\n&gt; what you see on these guys.  most of the items are jewelery, so you may not<br/>\n&gt; see that.  but every tank at our raids has froglok crowns and gnomish<br/>\n&gt; environmental suits on.  you can see those easily.  a tank with<br/>\n&gt; russett/indoclite mixed with a leather tunic and no helm stands out.  come<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I saw shaman in full grey planar gear, I saw a warrior in full indo<br/>\n  minus helm (froglok crown on no doubt), a cleric in absolutely full <br/>\n  purple armor, some casters had helms.  You&#39;re right, without inspecting<br/>\n  each person (I did look at a few), I noticed no big surge of +CR/FR<br/>\n  stuff.  In fact, despite what Miriana says... they did Nagafen, and<br/>\n  immediately, do not pass go, do not collect 200$ went for Vox, I watched<br/>\n  them the whole time.  Gate from Solb to WK, and straight to everfrost.<br/>\n<br/>\n  While some items produce CR/FR effects, not all items do.  So for<br/>\n  a team so concerned with resistances as was said, why didn&#39;t they<br/>\n  hit the bank and swap out gear for the next dragon?  Why didn&#39;t <br/>\n  they pickup another bard?  They had 3 or 4 groups, and only 2 bards.<br/>\n  I would have offered to go for the experience, and no loot.  The<br/>\n  answer is that it&#39;s so routine for them, and they are so experienced<br/>\n  at it, they don&#39;t need much resistance support.  Which was my whole<br/>\n  point of this resistance thing, that if you have the right people,<br/>\n  you can whoop a dragon without going overboard on the Elem/Guard<br/>\n  songs.  You could then play VoV and Elemental, or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Harm, come to the dark side.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Never.  I still know there&#39;s good in you, I can feel it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
