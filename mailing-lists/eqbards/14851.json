This is an opportunity to say goodbye to him, to meet <br/>\nand mingle with other bards from every server, and to have some silly fun at <br/>\nthe same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeet at the Priest of Discord in Rivervale at 12noon PST (that&#39;s 3pm EST, <br/>\n8pm GMT) on the Tunare server.  Bring a halfling with a name beginning with <br/>\nJx and then your bard&#39;s name (e.g. Jxaloro, Jxdemari).  It&#39;s been brought to <br/>\nmy attention that some of these names, for who knows what reason, aren&#39;t <br/>\ngetting through the filter.  Try adding an &#39;a&#39; after Jx if needed (e.g. <br/>\nJxademari).  Please don&#39;t go /anon or /roleplay, so we can find you and get <br/>\na participation count, and please don&#39;t go PvP or we can&#39;t bind you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re going to run to High Pass, get bound, and then run out to the gorge in <br/>\nEK and leap lemminglike into the great beyond.  Following our ritual mass <br/>\nsuicide, drinks will be served and merriment will ensue.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you all there!<br/>\n<br/>\nJxaloro (Tunare)<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
