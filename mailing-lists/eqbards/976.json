They were very <br/>\ncool, and I had many fun adventures with them. I kinda figured it out <br/>\nbecause they &quot;typed&quot; mainly broken english. (If any of you know Ryuzem, <br/>\nSapphirezz, Beni, or Layel, tell them I said &quot;Hi from Tavyn!&quot; Oh and if you <br/>\nsee Ryuzem let me know what server he is on, haven&#39;t spoken to him since <br/>\nbeta 3.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my party members was an expecting mother, and had her child during <br/>\nbeta and was out for a couple weeks. Another one was a student from <br/>\nArgentina, and I met a few more from Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally I&#39;ll only ask if it&#39;s someone I party with alot though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
