I was an <br/>\n&gt;amateur bard in the SCA for 10 years, and played a harper on several <br/>\n&gt;different Pern MOOs back when I was heavily into text-based online gaming. <br/>\n&gt; So the Bard was a natural character choice for me.  Also, I liked the idea <br/>\n&gt;of a class that was designed to compliment a group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have occasionally had trouble finding a group to party with, but most of <br/>\n&gt;the time groups are very happy to have me join unless they already have <br/>\n&gt;another bard with them.  Most players around my level on Solusek Ro are <br/>\n&gt;very aware of the benefits of having a bard in the party -- especially the <br/>\n&gt;monks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
