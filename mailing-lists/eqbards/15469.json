It&#39;ll<br/>\npoint you in the direction of the corpse, but more<br/>\nimportantly, it&#39;ll make the corpse your current target.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext you use Solidarity of Vision (L34) to bind sight to the<br/>\ncorpse.  Switch to an external camera view, rotate around, and<br/>\nusually you can tell from the surroundings exactly where the<br/>\ncorpse is.  VERY useful for finding corpses in dangerous<br/>\nsections of a dungeon, or if the corpse isn&#39;t where the person<br/>\nthinks he died.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
