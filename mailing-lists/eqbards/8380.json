If you&#39;re attacked while looting, you&#39;ll have to<br/>\ntrain back through 14 undead frog spawns, 5 greater iced bones, and 1<br/>\nvampire bat (which is the one non-undead spawns you&#39;re forced to deal with<br/>\non the way from the upper guk zone line to the assassin spawn).<br/>\n<br/>\nDirections:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the zone line... go down the ramp until the path splits, take the<br/>\nright fork and follow it to the water.  Swim right along the bottom until<br/>\nthe path ends, and surface into the bedroom.  You&#39;ll see 2 paths out of<br/>\nthe bedroom, technically both paths lead to the same room, but take the<br/>\nleft one and bear left into a hallway, stay along the right edge of the<br/>\nhallway and you&#39;ll run past 5 greater iced bones.  You&#39;ll come up to a<br/>\nbridge and run straight across into the tower.  The assassin is in the<br/>\ntower.  I&#39;m not going to go into the specifics of the tower itself, but<br/>\nthis should be plenty to get you started.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana Windryder<br/>\nLvl 50 Cleric<br/>\nLvl 15 Bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
