Here is my take.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the trade window is the key.  This is how you show items to friends<br/>\nanyway, with relative safty.  Make the song so that items in the trade<br/>\nwindow are effected by the song, so that both parties can right click on the<br/>\nitem and view the lore.  This keeps the skill more personal.  You would not<br/>\nhave to group with someone to use it on them.  Also, this would allow those<br/>\nwho wanted to charge for such a service able to do that.  For the record, I<br/>\nwould never charge for a service like that, its not me(unless they were a<br/>\njerk).  But the ability to charge for the service, and the fact that some<br/>\nwould charge, will make me look better for not :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I think the party effect is unsavory.<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin Tercet 20th Human Bard<br/>\non Brell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 22, 1999 11:14 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Petiton to replace level 14 song<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI have a tough enough time deciding which 8 songs to keep<br/>\nmemorized as is.
