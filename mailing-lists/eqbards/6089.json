Sure, I say, let me learn<br/>\n&gt;a few appropriate songs (Chords, etc) and I&#39;ll equip the Lute.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We do pretty well at reavers, but I notice my hand-to-hand skill never <br/>\n&gt;moves.<br/>\n&gt;Eventually we get into a bad situation (or more correctly, a bad situation<br/>\n&gt;is delivered to us by another player) and I switch over to Longsword and <br/>\n&gt;Dirk.<br/>\n&gt;Immediatly I start getting skill-ups in Offense, Dual Wield, etc (I had <br/>\n&gt;just<br/>\n&gt;recently made 19th and spent the session before making the cross-country <br/>\n&gt;run<br/>\n&gt;to get Clouding).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So it seems that you don&#39;t get any chance to increase your skills (hand-to-<br/>\n&gt;hand or any other offensive skills) when using the Lute.  As far as I could<br/>\n&gt;tell, you don&#39;t increase in Dodge or Defense either...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;After realizing that I switched over to pure hand-to-hand, thinking that <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;Lute was the problem.  I still didn&#39;t notice any skill-ups, but I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;fight very long this way before giving up (without the Lute it was hard to<br/>\n&gt;take down the reavers).  Perhaps I didn&#39;t see any skill-ups because my <br/>\n&gt;hand-<br/>\n&gt;to-hand skill is pathetically low to begin with?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone with more experience in the support-bard role have any tips for a<br/>\n&gt;battle-bard?  I was pretty impressed at how effective I am at higher levels<br/>\n&gt;with just songs...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Luvas of Fennin Ro.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
