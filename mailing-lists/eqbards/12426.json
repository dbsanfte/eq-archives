I was taking out Red Evil Eyes at 17th with<br/>\njust one other person a lvl 17 SK and no harm touch.  We resisted 17 charms<br/>\nin one fight.  In fact the only spells that got thru were one Tashan and one<br/>\nDD.  Now that said, the higher the level difference between you and your<br/>\nopponent, the less difference a higher resist will make.  Having an MR or<br/>\n127 at level 21 was enough though to resist 3 roots in a row from a Decaying<br/>\nHealer in Kithicor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 04, 2000 4:09 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] News on stats from Abashi via EQCaster&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis topic has been heatly discussed on the alt.games.everquest newsgroup<br/>\nrecently.  A lot of people, especially the shamans, are really disgusted if<br/>\neverything Abashi stated was true.  To sum up what he said in very general<br/>\nterms, DEX and AGI have no impact whatsoever on combat skills like dodge,<br/>\nblock, riposte, and parry.  DEX has no impact on improving your chance to<br/>\nget a successful hit.  There was more to his post but DEX and AGI I think<br/>\nare the two stats everyone was primarily complaining about.  One person even<br/>\nposted that for the melee classes, since stats are almost meaningless, EQ is<br/>\nmore a first person shooter than a RPG.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf its true that primary stats don&#39;t really affect combat skills that much,<br/>\nI wonder how important resist rates are?  I would really hate to find out<br/>\nthat they aren&#39;t important in successfully making a resistance roll as we<br/>\nthink they are.  Black helicopter sighting here:  the other night I was in<br/>\nMistmoore and my party decided to pull a negotiator that was wandering.  I<br/>\nequipped drum and weaved both elemental and guardian rhythms.  That raised<br/>\nmy magic resist rate to well over 100.  Myself and three other people in my<br/>\nparty still got charmed by the negotiator.  I had told everyone beforehand<br/>\nthat I would have both songs up for the entire fight so none of us were<br/>\nlikely to get charmed.  To say the least I wasn&#39;t the most popular person in<br/>\nthe group after that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n30 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; According to Abashi and reported by EQCasters, stats affect your chances<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; raising your skill level in skills.  Agility increases the chance of<br/>\n&gt; getting<br/>\n&gt; a skill raise in dodge is a listed example.  This would seem to greatly<br/>\n&gt; downplay the value of stats once you hit your skill cap in many areas<br/>\n&gt; sadly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
