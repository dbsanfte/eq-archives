Do you actually have to go out and kill innumerable giant<br/>\nspiders, or is there a place you can just buy these and cut out all the<br/>\nrunning around?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example...I have been working on baking lately and I had saved up about<br/>\n80 fresh fish I had caught and after trying to kill bats (for their wings)<br/>\non the order of obtaining about 80 batwings for &quot;fish rolls&quot; I finally gave<br/>\nup and found a merchant selling batwings for cheap enough that I &quot;ate&quot; the<br/>\nloss and bought a backpack full.  This is what I would like to do with<br/>\nspider silks instead of running all over the place at level 29 killing<br/>\nspiders like some kind of wild neurotic arachnophobe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHints, suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n Master Brewer<br/>\n Master Potter<br/>\n Master Fisherman<br/>\n E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.

Raw silk begins triviality <br/>\n&gt; at 33 (gloves,<br/>\n&gt; mask) and is still not all trivial at 39.  Cured Silk does not begin<br/>\n&gt; triviality until after at least 44 where I am now unless it <br/>\n&gt; is the masks,<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t made one of those in a few points.  Also the raw silk <br/>\n&gt; and Cured silk<br/>\n&gt; will sell to vendors for about break even.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; suggest that unless<br/>\n&gt; desperate though since the Cured is selling for 2-3pp per AC <br/>\n&gt; point currently<br/>\n&gt; (at least on E&#39;ci) and even the raw silk sells at 1pp+ per Ac <br/>\n&gt; pt.  Boots are<br/>\n&gt; the biggest sellers for me.  No one seems to want a raw silk <br/>\n&gt; tunic, but the<br/>\n&gt; Cured Silk tunic is so popular (due to giving that buff <br/>\n&gt; guildmaster look) I<br/>\n&gt; have been selling them for 25pp with no complaints or <br/>\n&gt; question.  The Cured<br/>\n&gt; pants are also very popular because the AC to wt ratio for <br/>\n&gt; them is ungodly<br/>\n&gt; good compared to even mesh.  Pants normally have the worst <br/>\n&gt; AC/wt ratio of<br/>\n&gt; any piece in an armor set so these are an amazing upgrade <br/>\n&gt; even over mesh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi soon to be master tailor <br/>\n&gt; \t(assuming bards don&#39;t have another ridiculous skill cap <br/>\n&gt; that stops<br/>\n&gt; me!)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
