Looks like you are<br/>\ngoing thru levels now where you are spending most if not all of your time in<br/>\ngroups.  That&#39;s what I did and really enjoyed myself from 20 thru 35.<br/>\nAround 35, I figured out I could solo with fear chain and spent a lot of<br/>\ntime doing that or grouping with 1 or 2 others.  By 40, I got into a guild<br/>\nwith alot of ppl my level and got back into groups and guild groups are<br/>\nloads better than pickup groups.  Also I began to get exposed to multiple<br/>\ngroup expeditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it has been pointed out, at the higher levels, in good guilds, all of the<br/>\nbases are usually covered and the job of &quot;filling in the gaps&quot; that a bards<br/>\nwere good at in their 30&#39;s is no longer needed nor would they be very good<br/>\nat it.  By then, the bard&#39;s role is mana regen and resist & other buffing.<br/>\nOnce you get out of Lower Guk, bard&#39;s can deal some damage but really have<br/>\nto limit their exposure to melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may think that the bard dieing alot is some how heroic but I bet the<br/>\nother classes think: &quot;the dumb bard got himself killed again...&quot; just like<br/>\nwe think about the dumb caster that nukes too early and too often.  I should<br/>\nhave thought about this more when I was younger and probably done more to<br/>\nnot get killed and sometimes that means stepping out of the melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I join a group to kill a dragon or hunt a god or clear a plane, I very<br/>\noften hear: &quot;oh good!  we get a bard!&quot;  And yes this is from the casters<br/>\n(clerics are casters btw).  Bards are unique in that they can generate<br/>\nsomething very valuable from nothing and replicate it widely.  Mana.  The<br/>\nwhole game is about using mana to detract from the opponents health points<br/>\nfaster than he can detract all of yours.  One of the most important things<br/>\nis assignment to groups.  Getting the right mix of ppl together so that the<br/>\nhealer can keep them alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMob &lt;--- tank &lt;--- healer &lt;--- bard<br/>\nMob &lt;--- caster &lt;--- healer &lt;--- bard<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned that &quot;you end up supporting the support classes.&quot;  I<br/>\nprefer to think of it as being the endless fuel supply that makes the whole<br/>\ngroup more powerful.  (Endless as long as you don&#39;t die.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe high level monsters are so strong that you need 3 to 6 sometimes more<br/>\ngroups to kill them.  The correct mix of classes is as important as the<br/>\nnumber of people.  No one group let alone person can do it without all of<br/>\nthe others.  I guess the classes that &quot;shine&quot; the most are: cleric<br/>\n(healing), monk (pulling), warrior (tanking), enchanter (crowd control) &<br/>\nbard (mana).  I think that all of the classes &quot;feel weak&quot; at the higher<br/>\nlevels.  But this is due to the level difference between player and mob.  I<br/>\nwonder what Verant is thinking.  Will there be &quot;blues&quot; and &quot;yellows&quot; that<br/>\nsingle groups high 40&#39;s and lo 50&#39;s can handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo those of you who have not been on a multiple group event, you think it&#39;s<br/>\nbad for the &#39;casual player&#39; who does not want to spend 30 to 45 minutes<br/>\nlooking for a group.  Think about doing a break-in where it takes 2 to 3<br/>\nhours just to get everyone into the zone.  Dragons are just as bad: an hour<br/>\nor more to assemble 3 groups to clear giants.  Another hour or more to<br/>\nassemble the rest of the groups.  An hour to buff everyone.  And maybe 5<br/>\nminutes to fight the dragon.  Then an hour or more for CR and loot.  And<br/>\nthen 2-4 hours or more to replace the exp you may have lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike anything, the more you do it, the better you get.  And then it gets<br/>\nboring.  Naggy? We did Vox last night can&#39;t we go kill Dojorn tonight?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Papa Legba &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is my take on the bard&#39;s role, since this thread is sort of turning<br/>\n&gt; that way:  I get most of this perspective leading a regular group as<br/>\n&gt; cleric (or in my football playing friend&#39;s words, I am the quarterback)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We all think (with little doubt) that<br/>\n&gt; so far the least important char in our group is the wizard.  She&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; great player (remember how I said I never had to cast heals on her?<br/>\n&gt; Thats a pretty good sign of a good wizard), but I don;t think the group<br/>\n&gt; really hurts without her. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
