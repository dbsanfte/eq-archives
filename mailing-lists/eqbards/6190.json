Then<br/>\nafter you game, run one of the eq parsers that player have developed - it<br/>\nwill build a db of your stats and performance.  Check for dl&#39;s on eq vault<br/>\nand such.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to the meat of the question:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will depend on the make up of your party.  If I get into groups where<br/>\nthere are tanks and the group is killing high reds (but not too high such<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t get any xp), then my ability to damage - even with good weps is<br/>\nso small that I opt to buff the party with songs that will help them more<br/>\nthan make up for hits for 2 and hits for 4 (would be my contributions when I<br/>\nam not missing 3 and 4 times in a row).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am as good or better at melee than those I am grouped with - then I<br/>\nhave to be the Battle Bard.  And then creative chicken-ology comes into the<br/>\nequation.  That&#39;s knowing when and how to let the other take their share of<br/>\nthe total damage that will be dished out.  You will need to start and stop<br/>\nsongs - stop your melee attack - stand and take a couple rounds while the<br/>\nothers taunt and build hate - step back and scrape the mobs onto your<br/>\npartners - equip lute and heal in combat (esp heal your self back up) then<br/>\ndive back in and taunt the mob with songs to pull it off the others, etc<br/>\netc. rinse, repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my ho,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, September 07, 1999 11:24 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Instruments vs. Melee quandry<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI fully expect that one of the subtleties of the Bard class<br/>\nis that as you<br/>\n\t\tmature into the role of Bard that your songs will, over<br/>\ntime, start to do more<br/>\n\t\tdamage than your weapons when instruments are equipped.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
