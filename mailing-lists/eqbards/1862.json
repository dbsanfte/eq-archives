I&#39;ve watched several times as my<br/>\noff-hand would swing, pause, primary, pause, off-hand, pause, <br/>\nprimary, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is correct and the dual wield check is made every<br/>\nswing cycle of the off-hand weapon, then the weapon speed does<br/>\nnot matter.  If your dual wield goes off 30% of the time, then<br/>\nit will increase your damage 30% regardless of what the weapon<br/>\nspeed is.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Most* of the times dual-wield succeeds it seems to be<br/>\nsychronized, so there may be more to it.  Perhaps it only goes<br/>\nasynchronous after a successful dual wield, and after a<br/>\nfailure the next check is synchronous with your primary hand?<br/>\nThat seems a rather convoluted way to program it; but if<br/>\nthat&#39;s the case, then Mr. Capozzi is correct, although the<br/>\nincrease in damage is not quite HUGE :-), and this advantage<br/>\nbecomes less the better you get at dual wield.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
