The warriors <br/>\nwe used to group with all parked it seems and started up casters. Our <br/>\ntypical crew now is a monk, a cleric, a druid, a mage, and me. Open slots we <br/>\nfill with a wiz, shaman, or druid depending on who&#39;s paying what and when. <br/>\nSo many time we are stuck for a real tank. So I do the tank bard thing <br/>\nmostly, except no pulling casters won&#39;t give up clarity usually &lt;g&gt;. But the <br/>\nhigher level you get the more a group needs the damage sink that only a real <br/>\ntank can provide, not to mention taunting. A group that doesn&#39;t have to <br/>\nforesight to foster melee classes will find later that they are sunk. We <br/>\nroutinely foster a friend of ours who plays a tank even though his play time <br/>\nis less than ours and he is over 10 levels lower. Managing involuntary <br/>\ntaunting is one of the biggest challenges we have without a real tank, since <br/>\nwe need to be able to pass mobs between me and the monk and keep them off <br/>\nthe casters. I still die, the monk FD&#39;s, and the casters gate (if they do <br/>\nwhat they are told that is.) It&#39;s oddly fun to screech a train off your <br/>\ndying group and &quot;ok get out guys before they come back and finish me, Ill <br/>\ntry to make it as far as I can when you are all safe.&quot; We don&#39;t take <br/>\nanyone&#39;s death as a given because we all are very close friends, some even <br/>\nin RL. Besides, clarity addiction is an awful thing, if I&#39;m dead I am one of <br/>\nthe first to get rez&#39;ed in. Clarity is a boring song but it really makes you <br/>\nthe darling of the caster set. Kit, your casters ought to be looking far <br/>\nenough ahead to see that leveling you is a real benefit for them. My crew <br/>\nhas a good bard education and asks &#39;When will we get this or that song?&#39; or <br/>\n&#39;what do we get this level?&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you start out, most classes are pretty equal. As you level up the game <br/>\nchanges, and the classes themselves diverge more and more. My cleric will <br/>\nfire up my account and run both our characters rather than tank things <br/>\nhimself unless they are way green. Before 30 he could tank some, now his <br/>\ntanking ability is pretty limited and it&#39;s not due to letting any skills go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t recall what we did before L25 now, I do recall at 25 we started a <br/>\ncamping campaign to get the 6 paladins in the guild at the time GBs. This <br/>\nwas rockin exp for a full group into the 30s. If we weren&#39;t actively camping <br/>\nthe lord, we sat next door and killed frogs anyway. You do need to learn UG <br/>\nvery well before becoming KOS but other than the named frogs, UG is pretty <br/>\nunderhunted and is very big.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love barding, and I tried about every class in beta. I have always had the <br/>\nmost fun being a bard. Gediprime described it best the other day, talking <br/>\nabout invising into the castle in MM to loot a gypsy lute and a WW talon, <br/>\nthen making a full speed run to the zone when invis flashed off while <br/>\nlooting, &quot;What a rush!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there Kit.<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe (one bubble to 44)<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony the crowded<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
