The Froglok <br/>\nCrusader and Priest spawn there.  The crown is dropped by the Froglok King <br/>\n(who else?!) which is a tough camp. At lvl 40 I&#39;d rather do the tower - <br/>\nthough King may be doable by a lvl 40 group. Hrm.. I do need to build up my <br/>\n50 xp buffer...better hit the throne room!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; the Lambent Helm?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   of the two pieces for this, the opaline helm is carried on<br/>\n&gt;   deepwater goblins.  They are much harder than they look.<br/>\n&gt;   During Sylly&#39;s event last week, two deepwater goblins were<br/>\n&gt;   pulled and Sylly, A level 50 cleric, and myself were almost<br/>\n&gt;   slain.  Nasty critters.  Again, if you happened to loot a<br/>\n&gt;   helm on the first try when L50s were farting around pulling<br/>\n&gt;   the DWs, then you got lucky.  We killed 5 that night, and<br/>\n&gt;   saw no helm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Use Charm. =)  Charmed DW Gobs make nice pets. I also find it&#39;s a nice way <br/>\nto avoid getting nuked by them. When they start casting and your charm hits <br/>\nthem their nuke bounces off you harmlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   Which is easiest -&gt; hardest?  (minus the luck factor)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Lambent, Crested, Froglok, in that order I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   HARDEST:<br/>\n&gt;   Froglok requires you penetrate a fairly tough dungeon, and<br/>\n&gt;   engage in a fairly decent fight with the king and guards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   HARDER:<br/>\n&gt;   Crested helm, the Caitliff isn&#39;t hard, he&#39;s just hard to get<br/>\n&gt;   to drop the helm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   HARD:<br/>\n&gt;   Lambent helm, practice and patience.  No dungeons, easy zone<br/>\n&gt;   if things go wrong, most pieces acquirable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
