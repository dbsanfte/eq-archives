I think it is so much<br/>\nclicking around that I miss most of the fun from fighting scenarios and the<br/>\nother players moves and all... It surely takes a lot of attention for us to<br/>\nkeep twisting songs, we could use all that attention helping tanks to<br/>\nprotect casters or anything else...<br/>\n<br/>\nEricka, the sexy one...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;The amount of RL finger twiddling that bards do to make their abilities work<br/>\n&gt;is so far above that required by any other class, we might as well be<br/>\n&gt;playing a different game.  I had a friend over last week who plays fairly<br/>\n&gt;regularly with me, he&#39;s the ranger from the test actually although his<br/>\n&gt;primary is now a druid.  When he saw the constant button manipulation<br/>\n&gt;required by bards during combat he was stunned.  He had always agreed we<br/>\n&gt;were a little underpowered, but felt all melee classes were.  When he saw<br/>\n&gt;what we have to do to make our abilities function he though that anyone who<br/>\n&gt;had to go through all that ought to see some benefit from it that was more<br/>\n&gt;significant than we do.  He said he would rather just have mana than go<br/>\n&gt;through all that constant finger waggling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKit<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
