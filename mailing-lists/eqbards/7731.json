These suckers make Runnyeye look like<br/>\nBlackburrow.  Anyhow, I&#39;m standing with my group in the &quot;pull room&quot; which is<br/>\nnear a zone into Nagafen&#39;s Lair (Sol B) to which we can run for cover if<br/>\nnecessary.  There is another group pulling into this room as well.  My group<br/>\nhad finished off a few and our wiz and cleric were medding so I&#39;m just<br/>\nstanding there.  Not even playing a song.  Just standing there.  The other<br/>\ngroup pulls two or three goblins in the room and one of them makes a beeline<br/>\nstraight for me and SMACK for 43,  SMACK for 22, SMACK, SMACK.  What the?  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot even on the aggro list of these guys.  So my group has to get up and help<br/>\nme finish the damn thing off.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne tip is that if you&#39;re fighting in a group where you&#39;re the (or one of the)<br/>\nlow level member of the group, don&#39;t play Area Effect (AE) songs at all, and<br/>\nkeep Hymn to a minimum.  Concentrate on playing as many buffing songs as you<br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome observations that should be in the FAQ if they&#39;re not:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Sitting is a taunt.  Green stuff will attack just about anyone if they&#39;re<br/>\nsitting and/or meditating.  If I&#39;m really low on health and need to heal after<br/>\nkilling some nasty stuff and there&#39;s a lot of green stuff around (The yard in<br/>\nUnrest comes to mind) I *will not* sit down to do it.  I&#39;ll crack out the<br/>\nMandolin and play Hymn standing.  If you sit down, the beetles and other<br/>\nrandom yard trash will swarm ya.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Every point of healing that you do to your party is percieved by mobs as<br/>\nbeing damage to them (I&#39;d like to see some research done in this area by the<br/>\nbard community).  So if you heal your group of six for 10 points each, you&#39;ve<br/>\ndone somthing like 60 points of damage to *each mob* that you&#39;re fighting.<br/>\nHymn is a good way to get every mob on you over the course of a few rounds,<br/>\nespecially if you&#39;re playing a stringed instrument.  For this reason I<br/>\nnormally don&#39;t start playing hymn at the very beginning of a battle.  Wait a<br/>\nfew rounds for the hate list of the mobs to be divided amongst you and the<br/>\nother tanks in your group.  Once people are starting to drop health (maybe 12<br/>\nor 15 rounds into a fight) I&#39;ll start playing hymn.  Don&#39;t listen to others<br/>\ntelling you to play it from the get-go, they&#39;ll get you killed.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Area Effect (AE) songs are a big taunt.  This includes Direct Damage (DD)<br/>\nsongs, but also includes debuffs like Binding, Lullaby, Chains, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Crowd Control becomes increasingly important at higher levels. If you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave a competent enchanter in your group, that task will fall to you.  As you<br/>\ngain levels it becomes increasingly difficult to pull only one or two mobs at<br/>\na time, and your ability to solo them drops dramatically.  If you pull too<br/>\nmany, your options are to zone, lullaby them, or pixie strike them and have<br/>\nyour group fight them one at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps, and the bulk of it wasn&#39;t really directed at you<br/>\npersonally, but all younger bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 25th (and holding) bard on fennin ro<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.
