This<br/>\nis a discussion group relating to bard issues, not guild/server<br/>\npolitics. Although it&#39;s great to exchange thoughts on dragon raids, I<br/>\nfeel discussing politics pertaining to Innoruk/Veeshan, who is a KSer,<br/>\netc. aren&#39;t what eqbards is about. I only point this out because I<br/>\nlogged onto my e-mail this evening and received 191 e-mails since<br/>\nyesterday evening, and the majority seem to be complaints about some<br/>\nguild on Innoruk.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease keep discussions relating to the Bard class. If you feel a need<br/>\nto discuss server politics, EQ Vault hosts a very nice series of<br/>\nserver-specific boards where issues of this nature may be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: [eqbards] Cazic Thule slain on Innoruuk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hehehe wow someone who knows who FoH is. I play on Veeshan with a lvl 50<br/>\n&gt; necro and run in to them ks&#39;ng me all the time on big events. My guild and a<br/>\n&gt; few others got so sick of it we are banding together. Now FoH posted a<br/>\n&gt; message on Sony&#39;s message board about how there are so many high lvls on the<br/>\n&gt; servers that there need to be more planes and more dragons and what not<br/>\n&gt; cause there is going to be lots of KS&#39;ng and fighting over spawns and what<br/>\n&gt; not. Man someone finally gets the player base to stand up to them and they<br/>\n&gt; run whimpering with there tails between their legs. Pay back&#39;s a bi**h.<br/>\n&gt; Anyways been lurking for a couple days getting ideas just started a twink<br/>\n&gt; bard and got it up to lvl 7. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
