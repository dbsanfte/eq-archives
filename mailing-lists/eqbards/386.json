One called it &quot;the feign death of the bard world.&quot;  I just don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;get it.  I have never found it to do anything except make just about every<br/>\n&gt;monster in range mad at me, even when I tried it with a Mandolin and a<br/>\n&gt;string skill of 100.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We tested it at the aquagoblin camp in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, playing the song<br/>\n&gt;to see if it would let me approach the camp without waking the goblins.<br/>\n&gt; Out of five tries (at 2 to 4 goblins apiece) I saw two messages of a<br/>\n&gt;goblin&#39;s head nodding, and all five times all of the goblins immediately<br/>\n&gt;swarmed me (including the one who nodded).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Earlier, I tried it in Blackburrow on a batch of regular and scrawny<br/>\n&gt;gnolls, all green to me.  (The remnants of a small train after the trainee<br/>\n&gt;fled the zone.)  Again, they all attacked me.  I also tried it in the<br/>\n&gt;newbie zone.  Result: one rat nodding and one rat attacking me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is there something I&#39;m doing wrong, or are all the people who wrote good<br/>\n&gt;things about the song basing their comments on a beta version that no<br/>\n&gt;longer applies?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Share the wealth!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Tell a friend about ONElist&#39;s 130,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
