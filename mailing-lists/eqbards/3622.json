But lord knows I was quivering every minute the first time<br/>\nin Paw since I knew it was a 45 minute run back from Qeynos as there was no<br/>\none in Arena to bind me and our groups only 12th level caster was a cleric,<br/>\nthus no bind yet.  I&#39;m irritated by the bind thing because I travel a lot<br/>\nand don&#39;t have the patience to sit at a bandit camp for more than about half<br/>\nan hour.  I can think of no level after 7th where I gained all my xp on one<br/>\ncontinent, much less one zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Kitasi the wide wandering<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Qeynos to Paw is nowhere near 45 min.
