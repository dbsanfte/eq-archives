I<br/>\n&gt; knew that I could now use duel wield and that I probably need to point<br/>\n&gt; into<br/>\n&gt; it for it to work, but I forgot to train in Freeport before I left, and<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; when I arrived at Kelethin I forgot to train  there as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now back in Freeport I went to the guild intent on putting some points<br/>\n&gt; into<br/>\n&gt; duel wield before I returned to hunting in Oasis. But to my surprise when<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; scrolled down to duel wield in the skills window I did not see the<br/>\n&gt; friendly<br/>\n&gt; &quot;no charge&quot; text, but a charge of 1 plat 3 gold.

Apparently, at least for this it&#39;s<br/>\n2xlevel(maybe for everything also).  A long time ago, I had heard that for<br/>\nduel wield, all you had to do was zone, and you automatically gained your<br/>\nduel wield skill, I think I tried it and it worked.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBien - Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Bernwyn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 10:22 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] dual weild<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well you are able to live without putting a asingle point into the<br/>\n&gt; skill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It will take forever to get the first few points through actually using<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.
