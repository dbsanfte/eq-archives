Its been so long<br/>\nsince we discussed this song on the list, I&#39;ve forgotten how it works.<br/>\nIIRC, it only works on one target and wears off very quickly.  That works OK<br/>\nif there is only one mob around but what if there are multiple mobs that are<br/>\nKOS to you?  It would be nice if the carillion was AE and kept working as<br/>\nlong as you kept playing it.  That might allow us to complete the Stein of<br/>\nMoggok quest (old Glowing Stein quest) as well as other quests in evil<br/>\ncities.
