It&#39;s<br/>\npretty apparent to anyone who is more than a casual observer that you do<br/>\nroleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose Erollisi as well.  Interestingly the Erollisi Mantraps in Swamp of<br/>\nNo Hope are not aggressive.  Go figure.  I figure the Iksar named them, so<br/>\nit&#39;s not surprising they feel threatened by a deity that portrays emotional<br/>\nattachment as a &#39;good&#39; thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you think that&#39;s bad, try going to the Isle of Erollisi without<br/>\nshedding a tear.  I remember the first time I found out where Purity Belts<br/>\nreally came from, oh my was that a painful revelation.  I spent the next<br/>\ncouple of hours travelling between W Commons and Freeport proclaiming to all<br/>\n(/shout) that those who who sold such things were in fact evil slayers of<br/>\ninnocent women.  A gm actually came and told me it was against the rules to<br/>\nwalk thru the zones spamming.  Apparently there is no freedom of religion in<br/>\n&quot;the Vision&quot;.  I nearly quit over that incident, though my friends begged me<br/>\nto stay and I couldn&#39;t say no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi Faegehearper de E&#39;ci<br/>\n\tServant of Erollisi<br/>\n<br/>\nActually I chose to worship Erollisi Marr.  I roleplay very well.  I also<br/>\nthink it&#39;s disgusting that the Flowers in EJ (Erollisi something or other)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate.  I don&#39;t mind the idea.  I&#39;d just like to see the currenly<br/>\nbroken stuff get fixed before they implement anything else &quot;new&quot;.  We have<br/>\nenough problems.  The last thing I need is to get killed walking into a bard<br/>\nguild because they somehow screwed up god factions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
