Thanks to<br/>\neveryone who commented.  At the time this all happened I must have<br/>\nbeen about 6 or 7, so I thought it was a good time to visit<br/>\nBlackBurrow!  Little did I know ....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really did seem to be that no matter what anyone else was doing,<br/>\nthe nasty gnolls would ignore every other sitting/meditating/insulting<br/>\nmember of the group and head for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what made it worse was when I would stand and take some beatings,<br/>\nand not do anything in return, it took an age for the other members of<br/>\nthe group to make the gnolls even notice they were there!!  Let the<br/>\nwizard zap it I thought, but no that didn&#39;t seem to have an effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I died a couple of times through being stunned and overwhelmed by<br/>\nthe 5-6 big ones who decided to jump in and help their little friends.<br/>\nThankfully I&#39;m back on familiar home ground now and running around<br/>\nButcherblock teaching the gobbos a lesson.  Maybe when I&#39;m older I&#39;ll<br/>\nresurrect the travelling spirit but for now I&#39;m safe(ish)!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 26 Jul 1999 13:24:56 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: Brandon Kassebaum &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kassebaum@...\">kassebaum@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am going to have to back up our younger bardic friend.  There is most<br/>\n&gt;definatly some bard aggro bugwhich can occur in seemingly any zone.  I have<br/>\n&gt;personally experienced this super aggro in butcherblock, oasis, and unrest.<br/>\n&gt;When I was in oasis, orcs were barelling over the dunes to find me, you can see<br/>\n&gt;quite a ways in oasis so I would see several dark forms off in the distance<br/>\n&gt;beelining for me and when they got close, hey 5-6 orcs all over. What joy!<br/>\n&gt;Thank Erollisi for Selo&#39;s (the biggest lifesaver of them all)  This has happened<br/>\n&gt;to me in those other zones as well... for no apparent reason, no group attacking<br/>\n&gt;anything like you suggest, things come out f the woodworks and ignore the<br/>\n&gt;medding nukers and beeline for the bard.  Its disgustingly insane, even when we<br/>\n&gt;have to zone to clear the faction list.<br/>\n&gt;*sigh*<br/>\n&gt;JM, Care to comment?<br/>\n&gt;Penaden Songweaver<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lostorder.com\">http://www.lostorder.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nSaldara<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (20), Mith Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\nMilaniel<br/>\nWood Elf Bard (8), Mith Marr server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
