The High shamen actually spawns in the room just<br/>\nto the east of the #17 on the map. There should be 4 spawns in the room<br/>\nmarked 17 and 2 spawns in the room to the east.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvis works fairly well here, just remember that wizards, shamen and<br/>\nsolussek grade goblins can all see through it. Most of the time though, you<br/>\ncan get there unmolested. In so far as camping, the room that is North and<br/>\nEast of the room where the High Sham spawns (the one with the grey corridor<br/>\nleading out of it) has no spawns in it and is a good place to camp. It is<br/>\naccessible through a secret wall in the hall outside of the room marked 17.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rebecca Small [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsmall@...\">rsmall@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 27, 2001 4:24 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Bards and Pulling (and a few other comments) <br/>\n<br/>\nGlowing Stone Band: comes out of Sol A, near the Goblin King?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
