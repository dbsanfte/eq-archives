I&#39;ve got it<br/>\n  down to a science now, I can pull them separately too.  I was just <br/>\n  one unlucky bard.  Now I kinda wanna go back and get another helm<br/>\n  so I can try to suit up in full black.  I have a charred bp, charred<br/>\n  gloves, charred boots, if I get some legs and arms that are black<br/>\n  I can toss on some silver bracers and look like an SK when illusioned.<br/>\n  hehehe.  I need to find one of those 2h bone bladed axes that have BRD<br/>\n  on them.  Didn&#39;t someone say if we wield a certain item, it looks like<br/>\n  an exe axe?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks, Harmonic!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  You deserved it, brother.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
