I would definitely suggest having a ranger with you when<br/>\n&gt;hunting in the plains. You can hunt Aviak Darters, Egrets, and Rooks if you<br/>\n&gt;have a good group. Rooks drop decent loot sometimes (rarely a darter might<br/>\n&gt;drop something very nice). Elephants (especially bulls) can yield decent xp<br/>\n&gt;but not decent loot. The Centaurs are also good but they can be tough.<br/>\n&gt;Centaur archers can drop medium ringmail sometimes, but they are tough (and<br/>\n&gt;they one of the WEAKER centuars).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sartori of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Last time I travelled around there I was probably level 6, but I have fond<br/>\nmemories of it.  I just thought the Aviak city was, quite simply,<br/>\nneat--perhaps reminded me of my home Kelethin while I seemed so far, and the<br/>\ncentaurs struck me as very interesting as well.  The time I was there I had<br/>\nthe whole zone all to myself, not many mid level PCs back then I guess.<br/>\nSuppose if I returned now I would be witnessing a slaughterfest.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nknow, I would never advise anyone to start lowering factions with a race<br/>\nwhich does not already hate you.  At the time, I remember thinking I would<br/>\none day learn the Centaur and Aviak languages and return to see if anything<br/>\nhappened.  I doubt anything would, but who knows, perhaps one day there<br/>\ncould be some interesting quests from those races.  &lt;shrugs&gt; Bards shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe exploring and making contact with new cultures to just slaughter them,<br/>\njust me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\nNow a culture which deserves to die is the Frogs!  Death to all frogs!  Then<br/>\ncollect their meat, and brew up something nasty with it and get drunk off<br/>\nyour arse off their slimey arses!  Heheh, I love Guk lately.  Place is a<br/>\nmadhouse.  What&#39;s great about is just about any level player can find a<br/>\nniche there, assist one another, and I&#39;m still impressed how most Trolls<br/>\nstay in character and talk like total morons.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
