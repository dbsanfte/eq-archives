Be at<br/>\n*least* 2/3 through 46 before you go up, or 47, preferably.  And that is<br/>\njust for Hate.  Fear has a far greater chance of un-ressable corpses, so<br/>\nI would suggest being a solid 47 before heading there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for tactics, I can only comment on Hate--my friends will not take me<br/>\nto Fear until I gain another level or two, as they know all too well what<br/>\nhappens when a yound bard bites it up there.  I know many of the bards on<br/>\nthis list will agree, but the best tactic I have found in Hate has been<br/>\nmana only.  Keep in mind, my situations are *very* specific.  We only<br/>\nfight on the far side away from Inny and Maestro (we tend to sit halfway<br/>\ndown that far wall and pick off all the clerics and such before pulling<br/>\nmore).  In addition, we have a *minimum* of one shammy per tank group,<br/>\nfor all the buffing we need.  My group consists of myself, one of the two<br/>\nenchanters, a cleric (this makes for a neigh well unkillable enchie),<br/>\nassorted other casters, and (occasionally) one tank who can taunt off the<br/>\nenchie, but not always.  We certainly aren&#39;t the highest damage group,<br/>\nbut with all the casters we often steal the kill.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it can be considered a little tedious to just sing mana and hack<br/>\naway at whatever-it-is, but for my first few times in Hate it was great<br/>\nfor helping other people and even better for letting me learn the way<br/>\nthings go before trying anything that might get me (or us) killed. <br/>\nHaving always been a fan of safely learning your surroundings before<br/>\nplunging in too deep, this works out great for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, all the little details have to be remembered--tons of great<br/>\nshammies who can buff everyone up the wazoo, the right combo of mobs, a<br/>\ngreat puller, and--most importantly--and organizer who *really* knows<br/>\nwhat he is doing.  Not being in a planes-capable guild, I consider myself<br/>\nlucky to have gotten into this loose coalition where I can have tons of<br/>\nfun with people I like, own our corner of the plane, and not be chewing<br/>\nmy fingernails in terror the whole time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s my take on it.  Your results may vary ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Karisma Swiftarrow<br/>\nwww.freespeech.org/karisma/intro.htm<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
