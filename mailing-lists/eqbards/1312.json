I<br/>\ndunno what changed, but the rapier graphic shows up correctly<br/>\non my character now (the bronze rapier I used to use showed up<br/>\nas a dagger).  It is awesome.  With the Whistling Warsong or<br/>\nAnthem going, it seems to swing with almost no delay.  I&#39;d<br/>\noriginally bought it instead of a longsword (sold my old<br/>\ncombine longsword at-cost to a nice player who hadn&#39;t saved up<br/>\nenough to buy it with his charisma) because my piercing skill<br/>\nhad been lagging behind, but after one night of use the rapier<br/>\nis such an awesome weapon that I&#39;d recommend it over a<br/>\nlongsword. The combine rapier is the same price as a combine<br/>\nlongsword, and has a slightly better damage rate (5/23 vs.<br/>\n6/28).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends and I will be visiting Najena again soon, but even<br/>\nif we do get multiple barbed whips, I think I will use just<br/>\none and keep the rapier in my other hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say buy the combine rapier and use it to get a barbed<br/>\nwhip.  :-)  Lots of stuff in Lavastorm and Najena can&#39;t be<br/>\ntouched without a magical weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
