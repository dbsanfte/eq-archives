The stores<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like having to give 2%-5% of their income to another<br/>\ncompany, so they started charging customers a credit card<br/>\nsurcharge.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe credit card companies didn&#39;t like that, so they lobbied<br/>\nCongress, and got a law passed banning credit card surcharges.<br/>\nThe stores complied with the law, and began giving cash<br/>\ndiscounts instead.  The people using credit cards still have<br/>\nto pay more, but now everyone feels better about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrengthening the mobs or weakening the players, the net<br/>\neffect is the same.  The only difference is one of perception.<br/>\nWhat you suggest will make players feel better about the game,<br/>\nbut it won&#39;t make a functional difference - the game will<br/>\nstill be more difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
