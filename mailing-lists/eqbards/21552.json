That being said:<br/>\nBack:  Cloak of the Icebear (Ac8, cold +20, something else) Around 150-200p<br/>\nNeck: Collar of Undead Protection (ac5, disease/poison +7) 20p  (if you go<br/>\nto someone camping the squire in guk, he will porbably give it to you for<br/>\nfree)<br/>\nFace:  Buy 3 potions of invis to undead and head to Lower Guk.  Find out who<br/>\nis camping the Ass/Sup, and ask them if you can loot the Guise.  (It is a no<br/>\ndrop rogue/bard only item, often rots).  If they say yes, get an invis (use<br/>\na potion if you can&#39;t get one at the zone) and walk over there. (its close<br/>\nto the zone, if you cant get a good map I could give you directions). Hang<br/>\nout in the corner, out of their way.  If the assasin pop, let them loot it<br/>\nand tell you if it has a guise.  (Ac4, magic resist and a LOT of cha, casts<br/>\nIllusion Dark Elf)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wear 2 jagged bands and 2 Oppaline Earrings at lvl 45 :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother peice to look for is a Tattered Mantle.  You can buy it for 300p,<br/>\nits ac12 and some other stuff.  Very good shoulder peice for a very<br/>\nattainable amount of plat.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
