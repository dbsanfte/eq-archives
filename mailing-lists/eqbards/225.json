Different songs <br/>\nuse different ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor most songs the instrument is optional.  However, I just made 19th level <br/>\nlast night, and discovered that the instrument is *required* for the mass <br/>\ninvisibility song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Lastly - I am always short of money.

Any suggestions for making money.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake an hour or two very early in the (real) morning, when not too many <br/>\nplayers are online, and go solo hunting whatever your local variety of <br/>\nintelligent weapon-using monster are thick.  Kill ones that are green to <br/>\nyou, or maybe an occasional blue, but the object here is cash not <br/>\nexperience so you&#39;re looking for fast easy kills.  If anything gives you <br/>\nproblems, turn on the boots and run for the zone or guards.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Kelethin this would be the orc camp area; in Qeynos, Blackburrow.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know the Freeport equivalent.  Anyway, you can make a couple of <br/>\nplatinum or so per trip depending on your carrying capacity.  We call this <br/>\n&quot;rolling Orcs for bus fare.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recommend trying this during the day.  These areas are very <br/>\ncrowded, so you can&#39;t get much, and also you&#39;d be stealing monsters that <br/>\nother players want to kill for experience.  I don&#39;t approve of that.  Also, <br/>\nthose areas tend to have a lot of trains during crowded times.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong, bard on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
