It is a<br/>\ndungeon in the middle of south karana. There are around 5-7 splitpaw gnolls<br/>\noutside that are 5th - 6th level. I believe it to be the best place for going<br/>\nfrom 6th to 9th (assuming you can live with a long walk if you die). With a<br/>\ngroup you could even head inside and hunt everything before the first bridge<br/>\n(you&#39;ll see it when you go in a little and thru some doors).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ooc: So if I help someone who is a level 23 warrior find their body, and<br/>\n&gt; they give me stuff, is this considered twinking?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my opinion, no.
