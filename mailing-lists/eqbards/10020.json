I never forage enough to<br/>\n&gt;keep me fed, I always have to get some food at the shop, so i generally get<br/>\n&gt;20 bread when I get water.

Please!  I&#39;ve heard several<br/>\n&gt; &gt;people complain about this in this thread.  I never<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have to buy food!  I think that is extremely useful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Granted, once you get to higher levels it isn&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;food is some huge expense.  But it is something you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have to remember to buy if you are a class without<br/>\n&gt; &gt;forage capabilities.  Me?  I just click forage when I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;remember and there is food.  Heck, it probably works<br/>\n&gt; &gt;less than 50% of the time but it definitely produces a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;big enough stream of food to keep my supplies up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thex Luteslinger<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Message: 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    Date: Wed, 10 Nov 1999 12:46:44 -0600<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: RE: Special foraged foods<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I think that&#39;s the major complaint - we get all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; these neato &#39;other&#39; class<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; skills - but our caps are so low - it makes you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wonder why they bothered? I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; or forage - but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   The other thought i have to add here is that like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tracking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;for druids...its a special skill.  we get it at a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; level and it never<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;advances..it caps at 20 and when we get it that is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the skill we get it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;at.  Is it possible that bards get forage and its<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at skill lvl 40 when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;we get it.  Just a thought...  oh yeah and skill<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cap for druids is 200<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;i believe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;=====<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
