I contacted my druid friend and had him gate me to<br/>\nlavastorm.  I entered the temple and made my way to the two quest NPC&#39;s<br/>\n(forget their names).  I was checking and re-checking, to make sure I had<br/>\nthe correct components/cash.  I was asking about all the Lambent pieces -<br/>\ninsuring that my list was still up-to-date.  As soon as I typed the &#39;a&#39; in<br/>\nlambent, I started attacking the female NPC.  I made a futile attempt to<br/>\nflee, but I made it no further than 10 paces before I became worm food.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend asks : &quot;What are you doing in Greater faydark?&quot;<br/>\nI respond : &quot;You won&#39;t believe what I just did...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, that was about the single dumbest thing I&#39;ve done in this<br/>\ngame yet.  Since I was feeling pretty bad about myself (I must admit it was<br/>\npretty hilarious though) I wanted to see if any of you fine bards had<br/>\nboneheaded experiences of your own to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar] - I did, eventually, get my bracer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
