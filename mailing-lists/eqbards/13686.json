If you want to get a reasonably good<br/>\n&gt; approximation of what % something drops, you need a number of tests one<br/>\n&gt; order of magnitude higher than the range.  So if its 5% you need at least<br/>\n&gt; 200 tests for statistical accuracy.  This isn&#39;t necessarily true for all<br/>\n&gt; randoms, but for psuedo-random numbers such as computers produce, it is<br/>\n&gt; generally the applicable rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ll gladly defer this to you and John(tm).
