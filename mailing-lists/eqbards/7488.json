For me<br/>\nat least, the time spent travelling back to your corpse from multiple zones<br/>\naway is not fun and completely boring.  That time could be better spent<br/>\nadventuring, which is the fun part of EQ to me.  Lets say on average it<br/>\ntakes you 15 minutes to get back to your corpse.  If you could get bound in<br/>\nnon-cities, the amount of EXP you could gain during those 15 minutes is<br/>\nnowhere near the amount you lost when you died.  However, you get to spend<br/>\nthat 15 minutes playing the game in whatever manner makes it fun for you.<br/>\nIMO, the binding issue isn&#39;t a class balance issue but a &quot;Is this really<br/>\nwhat I want to be spending my valuable game time doing&quot; issue.  Don&#39;t take<br/>\nany offense, but based on the fact that you have a 50th level character and<br/>\ntwo 20+ level characters, you obviously have more time to devote to playing<br/>\nEQ than I do.  My only character is my 23d level bard and I&#39;ve been playing<br/>\nhim since April.  That gives you a pretty good idea how much time I get to<br/>\nplay.  As I have said before, for casual gamers who don&#39;t get to play EQ<br/>\nthat much, not being able to bind in non-cities has a major impact.  When I<br/>\ndie, that pretty much writes off the rest of the gaming session for me.<br/>\nThats why I support a change to the policy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tGarramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, September 30, 1999 1:25 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; sorry i don&#39;t see the connection.  i advocate not letting melee/hybrid<br/>\n&gt; classes to be able to bind, making the game harder.  how does that make it<br/>\n&gt; easier to &quot;win&quot; or have anything to do with what you said?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; no one likes dying, not just some folks.  that&#39;s the point, it is bad to<br/>\n&gt; die.  if there were no consequences, there would be no challenge.  is this<br/>\n&gt; what you are referring to, my point of the game being a challenge?  this<br/>\n&gt; has<br/>\n&gt; nothing to do with wanting to win, it has only to do with wanting to have<br/>\n&gt; fun, and not being bored.  it is after all a game, and if you are not<br/>\n&gt; having<br/>\n&gt; fun, you shouldn&#39;t be playing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some folks just don&#39;t like dying - that in and of itself is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; penalty, thank you very much.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is where the paradigm falls back to singlemindset games <br/>\n&gt; &gt; - that there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has to be a way to &#39;keep score&#39; - that puts the emphasis on <br/>\n&gt; &gt; advancement and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; competition with others - instead of living in the world, and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; working with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; You cannot &#39;win&#39; in a persistent world - nor should the goals be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; artificially propped up to encourage that attitude.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; One of EQs major shortcomings - is there is a perceived <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;end&#39;. Games - read<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;worlds&#39; of this nature are going to have to mature past the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; singleplayer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game mindset baggage they have towed along with them, for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; these worlds to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; truly reach their full potential.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
