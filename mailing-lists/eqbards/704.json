This armor if u didnt know is much lighter than plate<br/>\nand just as good(i think, i dont have stats on all pieces)..also got a<br/>\nthick leather apron from unrest  ac8 weight 1....<br/>\n2ndly as you get this high there are plenty of magical items to pump up<br/>\nyour strength..both as loot and now from enchanters as they get higher up<br/>\nin level.<br/>\nSo as you can see dont worry if your not arnold the bard...i found my<br/>\npumped dex and agility much more useful as lowere level than i would<br/>\nstrength...:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:57 PM 5/14/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Lorrie Hopper&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lhopper@...\">lhopper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would suggest pumping up your strength above all the other stats, thus<br/>\n&gt;enabling you to wear better armor later among other things already mentioned<br/>\n&gt;in other posts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As far as best race goes, personally I dont think there is one.  I play a<br/>\n&gt;wood-elf and a half-elf , putting most of the extra points into strength on<br/>\n&gt;both characters and there isnt a difference in playability that I&#39;ve seen so<br/>\n&gt;far.  The wood-elf is my favorite though only for convenience sake since you<br/>\n&gt;get forage and hide right off the bat where as half&#39;elves dont.  If you like<br/>\n&gt;being human go for it, never played one yet as I dont like the lack of night<br/>\n&gt;vision.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hope this helps =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
