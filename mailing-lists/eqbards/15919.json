Definitely great earrings for a proper tank though.<br/>\n&gt; I currently have Opallines from Unrest that are AC 2, CHA 5 and a jeweler<br/>\n&gt; made STR/INT pair that I swap out when I want to feel butch.  But come on...<br/>\n&gt; STR just isn&#39;t that important for a bard, and even with two Diamondines you<br/>\n&gt; only add 24 HPs.  24 HPs is almost insignificant fighting most of the stuff<br/>\n&gt; I fight (i.e. a Spite Golem that doubles on me for 130).  So to me it&#39;s down<br/>\n&gt; to just the 4 AC points, the same as I get from my Opallines, along with 10<br/>\n&gt; CHA points which are (should be :) significant to a lot of our songs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I welcome arguments in favor of Diamondines.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey Crier,<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are more rare and they LOOK COOL!
