What<br/>\ndoes that mean?  It seemed that if a MOB had just attacked and my song<br/>\npulsed, the MOB went to sleep.  If the MOB (in my case a goblin) had started<br/>\nswinging its arm at me and the song pulsed, it would nod, but not go to<br/>\nsleep.  It is as if the MOB sleeps, but it then re-agro&#39;ed by its attack on<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also noticed that pulling MOBs through other MOBs seems to cancel the<br/>\neffect of Lament (much more so now then before) which seems to indicate a<br/>\nvery small agro radius as a result of the song which I believe is already<br/>\ndocumented.  What I also noticed, however, was that a MOB didn&#39;t always run<br/>\nright for me when I pulled it.  If I was at the wrong angle, the MOBs<br/>\napproach vector would send it first backwards (agro&#39;ing its buddies) and<br/>\nthen forward towards me.  As I adjusted my angle of pull, I was able to get<br/>\nthe MOB to charge a straight line for me instead of making the backwards hop<br/>\nand thus agro&#39;ing its buddies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, on the Choon and Froon note.  My brother&#39;s druid was looking for them<br/>\nin the FOG and ran right through their camp with SoW.  He ended up only<br/>\nagro&#39;ing Choon and we had to go back and get Froon for me to charm them to<br/>\nfight, so it seems one can be agro&#39;ed without pulling the other.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to puts odds on this working though.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 30th song<br/>\nPrexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
