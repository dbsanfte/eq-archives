I have four examples taken from real results of the changes:<br/>\n<br/>\nBox of abu ja&#39;far: A weakling spellcaster with a big brain who does a lot of<br/>\ntrade skills logs out with a box full of ore for smithing, then logs back in<br/>\nafter the patch and is so encumbered he cannot move and must subsequently<br/>\ndrop all his ore on the ground and cut his losses.  I don&#39;t know how many<br/>\npeople this really affected, but I guess it would have been better for<br/>\nreasons such as this (not even taking into account the 1500-2000pp others<br/>\npaid for what turned out to be not much better than a tailor made backpack).<br/>\n<br/>\nHero Bracer: A ranger character wearing the bracer removes it and puts it in<br/>\nthe trade window to show a friend the day of the patch and when he goes to<br/>\nre-equip it, lo and behold, he can no longer do so.  I say oh well to this,<br/>\nlive with it, but it did not affect me either so I am biased in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrder of Thunder: This DID affect me, I was truly saddened to find my<br/>\nmedallion lost its piddily 2AC points AND its light source affect<br/>\nconsidering that it has always been a LORE, NO TRADE, NO DROP item for the<br/>\nmonths that I have had it.  I wondered, why? Is it THAT big of a deal?<br/>\n<br/>\nRusset Armor: Same scenario as the Ranger who could not re-equip his Hero<br/>\nBracer, but in this case, you remove your armor and now you have no armor,<br/>\nand you can&#39;t sell or trade it because it is NO TRADE NO DROP.  I do think,<br/>\nhowever, that if you are high enough level to have that kind of item, you<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have all that much trouble replacing it with something decent,<br/>\n(not from fear plane of course ;-) again (as in the box) fair warning would<br/>\nhave resolved this.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy 2cp<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 16, 1999 10:20 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Re: revenge is sweet you know...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; absolutely.  i don&#39;t understand the reversal of lustrous russett from<br/>\n&gt; warrior only to all plate wearers.  it is obviously intended <br/>\n&gt; to be warrior<br/>\n&gt; only and i hope they change it back.  every armor from PoF is <br/>\n&gt; class specific<br/>\n&gt; to one class.  lustrous russett should be no different.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada D&#39;ukal, Level 50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt; Erisi Dlarit, Level 23 High Elf Paladin<br/>\n&gt; Tyria, Level 17 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What does everyone think about all the changes from monday&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; patch that were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reversed yesterday? (Box of abu ja&#39;far [sorry, cannot resist <br/>\n&gt; &gt; : )], Hero Bracer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc.)  Personally, i think the Lustrous Russet armor SHOULD <br/>\n&gt; &gt; BE warrior only,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but they should have made it so instantly when they <br/>\n&gt; &gt; discovered the error.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    GRAB THE GATOR!
