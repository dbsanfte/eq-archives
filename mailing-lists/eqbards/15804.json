Song combat<br/>\n&gt; means you save money on expensive weapons (unless they are gifts).  This<br/>\n&gt; money can go towards better armor and your songs (instruments are cheap :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am not certain that four song weaving is beneficial over three.  I tried<br/>\n&gt; throwing in either bellow and/or chains with some twists.  Unless you can<br/>\n&gt; minimize the time with just 3 song coverage (to one second or less), you<br/>\n&gt; are probably losing more in terms of efficiency than you are gaining with<br/>\n&gt; extra damage or slow down effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you zone into EK from Highpass, and go all the way down to the end of<br/>\n&gt; the ramp, take a left, pass the named gnolls (carefully), there is a big<br/>\n&gt; hill made of<br/>\n&gt; rock which is crawling with rock spiders.  Usually, these are plentiful<br/>\n&gt; and non camped.  Locate one, insult it with bellow, and lure it to an<br/>\n&gt; isolated area (the zone edge nearest this mountain among the trees is<br/>\n&gt; good).  Then twist away.  In general, stick to the spiders who /con low<br/>\n&gt; blue rather than high...it makes a big difference.  If you get poisoned<br/>\n&gt; early, take the spider to the barbarian guards in the village, and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; hesitate.  Make sure not to sing AE&#39;s around them :o)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tended to run later rather than earlier, and it was a while before I<br/>\n&gt; learned the benefit of picking low blues...so I took some lumps.  If you<br/>\n&gt; can find a single partner to hunt with (somebody who can cure poison,<br/>\n&gt; preferrably), you&#39;ll do really well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sinistral of Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 6 Mar 2000, Talies the Wanderer wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Okay, so I&#39;ve got some good suggestions for where - now how about some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; HOWs?  I mean, I&#39;ve nearly got the hang of 3-song weaving, (I&#39;m too<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unreliable on 4) - do you recommend that or melee?
