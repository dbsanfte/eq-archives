There are exactly two ways out,<br/>\nfire shield yourself as much as you can, swim in, get your stuff, zone to<br/>\nsol B and hope you can make it out of the lava there before you die or<br/>\nlevitate, get your stuff and gate.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Neither of these options is very good.  IMO, its a bug in the software<br/>\nthat its one way (at least that&#39;s what a GM told a friend of mine who got<br/>\nstuck there) but he didn&#39;t get any help either.  It was worse for him though<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s a troll. Without the guise of deceiver or a shaman around he<br/>\ncan&#39;t even FIT in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The fact that you reaquired your stuff speaks highly of you!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 44 Bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
