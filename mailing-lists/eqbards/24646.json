I got a Guardian BP, Sentry Pauldrons and<br/>\na Guardian Girdle which is one of the phatest items for a bard for a waist<br/>\nslot. 12 AC 2wt +5 CHA and some other stats. I&#39;m currently working on<br/>\ngetting Guardian arms and legs. XP is decent but I mainly hunt here for the<br/>\narmor. The songs I use while grouped are. Berserk Cresc, Furfils, Chant of<br/>\nFlame. On some casting mobs I usually twist in Denon&#39;s Dissension to keep<br/>\nthem from casting complete heals on themselves. Also throw in some DS&#39;s.<br/>\nEither Cooling or Warmth will work. Lastly of course Bewitch Brauvura is a<br/>\nmust for crowd control. Pixie Strike will work too, but I prefer to have the<br/>\nmob work for us instead of standing there loafing about. One last thing, you<br/>\ncan use invis song to scout out the area, BUT, be very careful in the<br/>\nCourtyard. There are some named drakes in the left corner that see invis.<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen those drakes take out a group of 50+&#39;s very quickly, and the<br/>\nhighest con, Suez, is only yellow to me at 42. If they all agro I&#39;d make for<br/>\nthe zone. Try and get your CS key first so you have another zone available<br/>\nin the Courtyard. Ziglark, a named drake drops the key every time and hes<br/>\nonly lvl 26ish. He is guarded by two Guardians though. Also, last note for<br/>\nthose of you going to SS, do not engage the two sentries at the entrance.<br/>\nThey will be green but they have uber hitpoints and still hit hard. Whenever<br/>\nI get in trouble and make for the zone I always charm one and let him take<br/>\nthings out while I get the hell out of there.<br/>\n<br/>\nArud Bastad<br/>\n42nd level Songstacker on Bristlebane<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From:<br/>\nsentto-160851-24662-989323206-matosvr=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theriver.com@...\">theriver.com@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:sentto-160851-24662-989323206-matosvr=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theriver.com@...\">theriver.com@...</a>.c<br/>\nom]On Behalf Of Bill Costlow<br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 08, 2001 4:13 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [eqbards] Skyshrine and armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Been grouping in Skyshrine with some higher level friends -- the dropped<br/>\narmor there totally rocks -- and a full set of it will take your resists<br/>\nright off the charts.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know a 52 druid there soloing to twink his 23 warrior.
