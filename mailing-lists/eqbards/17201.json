The only thing that slows tanks down here <br/>\nis healing - and if you can keep them healed (and throw in some occasional <br/>\ndamage like with Chords of Dissonance or Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow, so you <br/>\ndon&#39;t even have to switch instruments), they&#39;ll love you forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got about half a level in one night just doing this.  In fact, I went afk <br/>\nto work on some paperwork and just left my Bard standing nearby, strumming <br/>\nthe Hymn.  When the tanks were wounded, they&#39;d sit near me, then run out, <br/>\nkill some more, and come back.  Spent about two hours like that and only <br/>\ngot hit twice ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Sleep-strummer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
