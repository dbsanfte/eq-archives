Our new<br/>\n  song is half as powerful as the Berserker Strength shielding<br/>\n  (Enchanter 20).<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Strength component is slightly better than the Shaman L29<br/>\n  spell called Raging Strength.  The new song has the same <br/>\n  Strength component as the Berserker Strength (Enchanter L20)<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Max HP component is close to 3/4&#39;s the component of the<br/>\n  Cleric 9 Center spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For all purposes, this new song resemebles the Enchanter<br/>\n  Berserker Strength spell across all party members.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It has half the range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando, and slightly<br/>\n  more range than Hymm, and close to equal range of Chant of Battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
