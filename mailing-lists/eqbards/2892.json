It<br/>\nsounds like it&#39;s random.  OR, if you did the quest before they started<br/>\nboosting the rewards, that could explain it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried luring the deputy away with critters.... he&#39;ll graciously attack<br/>\nanything you bring near... I started a train (hard to do cause I almost kill<br/>\nthe little crap with 1 swing, hehe) and lured him away.  He got back before<br/>\nI could run back, up the ladder and hit Bronin.  I&#39;ll try it with help<br/>\nluring him away, and I&#39;ll wait upstairs and hit him.  I&#39;ve been jumping off<br/>\nthe tower to try and get away from the Deputy and guards.  Also, the first<br/>\ntime I did it, nobody else helped.  Was just me and Bronin.  The second<br/>\ntime, I was being hit by Bronin, 2 other weasels, and the Deputy.... Guess<br/>\nthis is definately group strategy time.  My &quot;Reputation&quot; which preceded<br/>\n&quot;Slaythe&quot; to the captain musta been wrong.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Dudley Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dud@...\">dud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You don&#39;t, you need to attack the little thug with several PC&#39;s and just<br/>\n&gt;sacrifice one of them (you) to the Deputy&#39;s wrath. An alternative is to<br/>\n&gt;attack mister deputy yourself, then run his little butt across the entire<br/>\n&gt;zone. You zone, he starts trudging back, you zone back and speedrun past<br/>\n&gt;him to the now alone thug. (Good roleplay there huh? ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can&#39;t believe you got a Dwarven Axe for this. I was maybe too high level<br/>\n&gt;when I did it (17th?) but I remember being really surprised as to how<br/>\n&gt;especially crap the reward was.
