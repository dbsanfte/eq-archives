Low<br/>\nWis will HURT you.  My rogue has a 109 int and an 83 wis (base, she&#39;s an<br/>\ninkie) so she rarely fails ;)  I&#39;d say, at 17 tailoring skill, she fails<br/>\nabout 1 in 4 tries.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ L<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 31, 2000 2:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] How many threads can I witness in one hour?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Nah, my bard is a tailor.
