First, all those<br/>\nundead camps in Kithicor that are usually full of &quot;trash&quot;<br/>\nundead (well, trash for a L20 bard)?  Wade right into the<br/>\nmiddle of them, fire up Chords of Dissonance with a lute, and<br/>\njust stand there.  Within about a dozen pulses, most zombies<br/>\nand skeletons wilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nEncouraged, I then went to Highpass and tried Denon&#39;s<br/>\nDisruptive Discord there. Three mage-types were stealing all<br/>\nthe orcs (much to the chagrin of the nearly dozen melee types<br/>\nthere - this really needs to be fixed at some point).  I fired<br/>\nup Denon&#39;s again during a rather heated battle with four orcs.  <br/>\nIt really ticks off the mobs, and three of them ended up<br/>\nhitting me down to two bubbles of health.  All the melee types<br/>\nwere attacking the same orcs, and the mage types were blasting<br/>\ntheir spells.  But when it was all over, I got credit for two<br/>\nof the kills without ever having placed a finger on my<br/>\nweapons.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried stacking it with Chords of Dissonance, but my brass<br/>\nskill isn&#39;t high enough to do this consistently yet (after<br/>\ntoday&#39;s experience, that will be remedied shortly).  Also,<br/>\nUnlike what some descriptions of CoD say, the mobs continue to<br/>\ntake damage after you&#39;ve stopped playing it, just like DDD and<br/>\nRestoration and Accelerando.  I&#39;d stop playing the song to try<br/>\nto start DDD, never get DDD started, and suddenly a skeleton<br/>\nor zombie would die without the &quot;winces&quot; message.  So CoD can<br/>\nbe twisted with Restoration with a lute for maximum damage and<br/>\nhealing.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
