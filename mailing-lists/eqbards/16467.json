I plan on replacing binding with<br/>\nCoC when I get it.  On the other hand, stacks does appear to be the right<br/>\nword when an enchanter is involved.  I don&#39;t have hard numbers, but there<br/>\nwas a definate percieved difference between binding vs. enchanter slow vs<br/>\nboth.  This one appears to stack.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for chains, until the efreeti raid I would have agreed with you.  We had<br/>\na total of 4 druids involved all going for their boots ranging from 41 to 49<br/>\nand not one got snare to stick... The bard had to save the day.  I&#39;ll always<br/>\nkeep this song up now for those situations where a runner means evac or<br/>\ndeath.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, very few of the bards on this list have CoC, but practically every<br/>\nsingle one of them has Binding...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, March 20, 2000 4:51 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Chains Reliability<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 20 Mar 2000, Jeff Illian wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For example, this weekend we did the Efreeti raid...

Luckily the other bard in the group had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chains loaded and stopped the runner cold in its tracks.

Well your level 20 song is as good as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chains, has an area effect, doesn&#39;t break root and stacks with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enchanters slow downs.  IMHO this is a much better song for<br/>\n&gt; during combat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and chains should be loaded for the emergency situations when everything<br/>\n&gt; &gt; else fails.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as I can tell, Chain does not cancel other slowdowns<br/>\n&gt; (&quot;stacks&quot; isn&#39;t the correct word since that implies the<br/>\n&gt; slowdowns add to each other).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have enough difficulty deciding which songs to keep<br/>\n&gt; memorized.  If I&#39;m going to have Chain loaded for emergencies,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d rather not have to keep Binding loaded.  Also, the<br/>\n&gt; slowdown for CoC is not as great as for Chain/Binding from my<br/>\n&gt; tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
