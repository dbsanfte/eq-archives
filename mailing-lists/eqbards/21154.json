There are at 3 least other better ways to break PoF.  Some stuff is<br/>\npretty standard planes ops but SW is a great place to LOSE alot of exp with<br/>\nmultiple deaths if you so desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe setup outside PoF - make 4 groups or whatever.  Send in first 2 groups,<br/>\n10-20 seconds apart.  They are sow&#39;d and invised and they make a left turn<br/>\nand run to the west wall - trying to avoid any agro - fairly easy to do.<br/>\nOnce they are set, if not agro&#39;d, they can cal in the 3rd group.  By then,<br/>\nalmost certainly agro&#39;d and fighting.  2 or 3 mid 50 and up groups with<br/>\nenchanters can easily handle the break. If they want some help and the route<br/>\nfrom the portal is clear, they can call in the next and subsequent groups.<br/>\nThe key thing is controlling the amount and rate of agro by controlling then<br/>\nnumber of folks running in. Less is more in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard other folks like to run to a north wall camp and others insist a NW<br/>\nwall run in is great.  But why run in, die, CR, camp off agro, etc etc etc<br/>\nwhen you can walk in and kill them all?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
