They&#39;re stupid and keep fighting each<br/>\nother once they die which is good so it&#39;s really a<br/>\ncase of watching their health to make sure you don&#39;t<br/>\npick the wrong one and not get xp.  Once it dies, I<br/>\nchant down the other one who&#39;s nearly dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get more technical, run close to a mob and target<br/>\nit with selo&#39;s going and your drum out.  Hit it with<br/>\nSiren&#39;s and turn to run incase it resists.  Restart<br/>\nselo&#39;s immediatly.  Find another mob preferably of<br/>\ndifferent race and /pet attack or run up and punch it.<br/>\nThis will get the pet to attack.  After that, stay<br/>\naway from them going in close occationally so you get<br/>\nan accurate picture of their hit points.  Have selo&#39;s<br/>\ngoing so you can outdistance to angry mobs.  If you<br/>\nget a resist, do not recharm immediatly but start<br/>\nweaving selos and charm till it sticks.  /pet attack I<br/>\nusually don&#39;t use and favor punching it because you<br/>\nreally have to be right next to the pet and fairly<br/>\nclose to the pet&#39;s target for it to work.  It&#39;s much<br/>\nbetter for group situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hot key bank I use for charm kiting is:  1 - /pet<br/>\nattack, 2 - /pet guard me, 3 - charm, 4 - hymm of<br/>\nrestoration, 5 - selo&#39;s acceleration, 6 - /pet who is<br/>\nyour leader.  I have hot key 6 for group situations so<br/>\nmy group doesn&#39;t need to ask which one the pet is (A<br/>\nKobold Shaman says, &quot;My Leader is Centiera.&quot;)  After<br/>\none dies and the other is near dead, I go to my DoT<br/>\nweave being 1 - chant of flame, 2 - fufill&#39;s, 3 -<br/>\nselo&#39;s.  Before I got chant of flame, I would go hymm<br/>\nof restoration to re-heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the patch it&#39;s still possible to charm kite in<br/>\nrathe mountains just not where I was.  Hehe, had 4 HGs<br/>\nand a clops after me recently cause the damage pet and<br/>\nHG ran way up ontop of the mountain in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrontier Mountains is even better for kiting.  Just<br/>\nfind a digmaster (who make killer pets) and a giant,<br/>\nsarnak, non-caster gobbie, gorilla and set it to work.<br/>\nThey will fight each other after re-charm so that&#39;s<br/>\ngreat.  I believe I had the single chant and was able<br/>\nto chant it down no problem.  The only problem with FM<br/>\nwas I created some pretty big trains sometimes (has a<br/>\nflashback of 11, yes 11! moles running after her) so<br/>\nwandering mobs can become a problem quick.  Oh, FYI,<br/>\nthe gorillas make the worst pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nBiggest dangers while charm kiting.  Lesse #1 in the<br/>\nstop-start-stop bug.  Nothing says time to die with an<br/>\nenraged HG following you and selo&#39;s pulses and doesn&#39;t<br/>\nstay on cause of that bug.  #2 is Linkdead.  Just<br/>\naccept that you&#39;re dead and come back taking your<br/>\ntime. You&#39;re not going to be beating 2 of anything<br/>\nwith your fists.  #3 would be lag.  Best advice I can<br/>\ngive you is if the serve lags put as much space<br/>\nbetween you and the mob(s) as possible.  I would get<br/>\nhit for obscene amounts of damage when the server<br/>\n&quot;caught up.&quot;  #4 would be text warp bug.  To the right<br/>\nof the zone in the OverThere, there&#39;s a spot where the<br/>\nmobs warp to you.  It&#39;s not real big but whatever<br/>\nyou&#39;re kiting will let you know when you&#39;ve hit it :P<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gains...  I charm kited specs and HGs from 4<br/>\nbubbles in 42 to 3 bubbles into 43 solo.  In that time<br/>\nI died once cause I was being arrogant (stupid me was<br/>\nfeeling invincible which the HGs promptly corrected). <br/>\nI went from 1400 in the bank to 5700.  Nothing beats<br/>\nit money wise but I was kiting them way early in the<br/>\nmorning 2am EST to 8am EST.  I also got through 40 in<br/>\n9 hours of play time.  It is really boring though.<br/>\n<br/>\nCentiera D&#39;Winter<br/>\n45th Half-Elf Bard<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\nCentiera,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am 34 right now.  Only have one chant.  I have charm<br/>\nkited fairly successfully - mostly Lake of Ill Omen,<br/>\nFM and Overthere.  But are you doing chanting,<br/>\ncharming,<br/>\nboth?  And as you said, the zone can only support so<br/>\nmany people.  If too many, lag possibly gets you,<br/>\nright?  I almost died last time in the Mountains due<br/>\nto lag.  I always enjoy the technical details of how<br/>\nthis <br/>\nis done.  Please indulge me one more time(and there<br/>\nare always young ones coming up who need the<br/>\ninformation as well). <br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
