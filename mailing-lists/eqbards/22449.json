When Fallout was being developed, Interplay was<br/>\ninitially using the GURPS RPG system as their base stat/skill system.  But<br/>\nfairly late into the development process, they lost the GURPS license and<br/>\nhad to create their own stats/skill system from scratch.  Now I don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow long this delayed release, but I don&#39;t think it was very long.  The<br/>\ndevelopers of DAoC can work on areas such as graphics, AI, client/server<br/>\ninterface, etc. while they develop a new stat/skill system.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 15, 2000 5:28 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Dark Age of Camelot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNope, count DAoC out.  Since ICE just folded, they&#39;ve lost the rights to <br/>\nthe role-playing game engine they were using as a core for the <br/>\ngame.  Contrary to statements to the otherwise, there is no way that they <br/>\ncan develop a new engine that is stable and decent in time to meet their <br/>\nschedule.  There WILL be delays.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Bubble-burster<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Shadowbane does look good in terms of gameplay - but the graphics look <br/>\npretty bad still.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:10 AM 11/15/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hate to see another good bard go, but wish you the best Elfson!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I followed a link off Lum&#39;s site to Dark Age of Camelot. I think they are<br/>\n&gt;starting closed Beta 2 with release scheduled for next summer. It sounded<br/>\n&gt;like a great game IF they can keep the system from being abused.
