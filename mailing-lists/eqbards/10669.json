Warriors are<br/>\n   sometimes lucky to even hit three.  I&#39;ve seen a monk<br/>\n   do 30 - 50 points per fist, and a 90 point kick.  A<br/>\n   monk can solo the permafrost throne room, a warrior <br/>\n   would have to flee.  You completely underestimate the<br/>\n   power of monks (yes, at lower levels its not that obvious).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My next point regards weapons.  If they are trying to balance the items, why<br/>\n&gt; is it I am still using the same weapons at 21st level I used at 12th level?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>   You are absolutely right, there is a huge gap in weapons.  Then<br/>\n   again you&#39;ve been spoiled by a mature server.  No one would dream<br/>\n   of trying to kill Mucktail to get the PGT at level 12, let&#39;s be<br/>\n   realistic.  Bonecracker and his necro horde kicked my ass in a full<br/>\n   group at level 20.  One handed silvery axe and Dirk is what I used<br/>\n   from level 30 to level 42.  Your best bet if you want something <br/>\n   better is to beg a higher level group in permafrost to just give<br/>\n   you a crystalline blade or silvery axe.  I have handed out two<br/>\n   crystalline blades and three silvery axes to young bards who were<br/>\n   just there for the greaves (since I couldn&#39;t hold another lore).<br/>\n<br/>\n   We do need more weapons that are midrange and even highrange.<br/>\n   Keeping that dirk (15pp from a friend) from level 19 to level<br/>\n   42 just plain hurts.  And a BLW from 19 to 30, then I got a <br/>\n   SWA, and then a few levels later a Crystalline Blade.  After <br/>\n   level 20, our weapons aren&#39;t very useful in the long run.  I<br/>\n   have two Yks now, and yeah they proc alot, and yeah they do<br/>\n   nice dmg, but that ranger beside me is kicking my butt in dmg<br/>\n   ratios, and the monk is absolutely blowing me away.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
