They were<br/>\nadvertised as also going over the haste cap, but tests have shown they<br/>\ndo not.  They are 5% and 10% respectively (useless that small and<br/>\nwithout going over the haste cap), probably designed that way with the<br/>\nintent of being 10% and 20% with instruments, which they require rather<br/>\nthan just being able to sing with the lesser stats.  However as we all<br/>\nknow, unfortunately instruments do not increase haste (or mana) on any<br/>\nof our songs, just stats like strength, agility, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nygaardr, FC3 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nygaardr@...\">nygaardr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, August 25, 2001 1:56 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure if they could do the stackable haste spells the way they<br/>\ncurrently<br/>\nwork.
