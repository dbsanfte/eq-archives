[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.j.mott@...\">mike.j.mott@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 15, 2001 9:59 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Chains&#92;Binding no longer overwrites snare<br/>\n<br/>\nI am suprised no one else has noticed this yet, but over the weekend i<br/>\ndiscovered (and had it confirmed and tested by another high level bard) that<br/>\nthe lvl 51 chains song no longer overwrites snare (we know it doesnt<br/>\noverwrite root, but snare was a suprise)!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tested the chains song with the Enchanter Slow line, and the<br/>\nenchanter slow overwrites the lvl51 song, but not the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this boils down to (from my observations of the lvl 51 song):<br/>\n<br/>\n*       We can now chain a mob to snare a mob if in doubt that it is snared<br/>\nor rooted<br/>\n*       We can now chain a mob to slow the mob, without fear of canceling<br/>\nsnare<br/>\n*       We can now chain a mob to slow the mob, without the fear of blocking<br/>\nan Enchanter slow<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have not tested:<br/>\n<br/>\n*       Other versions of our chains (the lvl 23 and lvl 54 aoe song) and<br/>\nslow songs (lvl 21 aoe) against snare or slow<br/>\n*       Any of the songs against the Shaman slow series<br/>\n*       All of my snare tests were done against low-level druid snare.  I<br/>\ndid not test any of the songs against the higher level Ensnare.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has always been my understanding that our slowing effects stack with<br/>\nEnchanter or Shaman slowing effects (but previous to the last patch would<br/>\nblock them if our song was up on the mob when the spell was cast).  If my<br/>\nabove testing proves to be true, this means that we are &quot;value added&quot; to<br/>\nenchanters and shaman both now, at least from a mana and slowing standpoint!<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to seeing if you guys get similiar results!<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon of Bertoxx<br/>\n55 Troubador<br/>\nGuild Leader, Defenders of Aleria<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
