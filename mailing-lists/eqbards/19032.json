I used to<br/>\n&gt;subcsribe to  the  digest, and boy do those   get<br/>\n&gt;long.  It was not uncommon for  it to be 40  or 50<br/>\n&gt;pages and there  are  four or five a day.  Well over<br/>\n&gt;half  of that content is duplicates or the advertising<br/>\n&gt;at the bottom or each  post.  This gets really old<br/>\n&gt;reading fast.  Either I would print them out so I<br/>\n&gt;could easily see where the true content was easily, or<br/>\n&gt;I would just endlessly hit page down and miss a post<br/>\n&gt;every now and then.  It is simple courtesy to clip the<br/>\n&gt;extra off.  I for one wish everyone  would take the<br/>\n&gt;time to do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
