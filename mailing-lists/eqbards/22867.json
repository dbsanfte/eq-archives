It may end up being wasted effort, but if<br/>\n&gt; the bard community can come up with solid reasoning as to why they should<br/>\n&gt; stack then perhaps we can get enough support from the rest of the EQ<br/>\n&gt; community that Verant will reconsider.  This would be a change that benefits<br/>\n&gt; every class without nerfing enchanters and shamans.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In regards to Berserker (42 song), is there anyone out there besides me who<br/>\n&gt; thinks the haste bonus of this song is screwed up?  Celerity at 36 gives you<br/>\n&gt; a 20% bonus while Verses of Victory at 50 gives you 30%.  Since Berserker is<br/>\n&gt; in between these two songs, doesn&#39;t it seem like the haste bonus should be<br/>\n&gt; 25% instead of 17%.  Also, Berserker is the only haste song pre-50 that is<br/>\n&gt; enchanced with an instrument (brass).  Anthem, Celerity and Verses are all<br/>\n&gt; singing only.  So shouldn&#39;t the haste bonus of Berserker be increased when<br/>\n&gt; you equip an instrument? The STR and AC bonus for using a brass instrument<br/>\n&gt; with Berserker is double.  So at a minimum, the haste bonus should be 34%.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
