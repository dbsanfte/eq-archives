We obviously play for different<br/>\nreasons and have fun in different ways.  However, the tips that I listed for<br/>\nreducing client side lags were not for you Harmonic, they were for the list<br/>\nin general as advice on what to do on their first dragon raid.  There are<br/>\nother people on this list that could benefit from advice other than &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>\ngo until you&#39;re 49, I wouldn&#39;t let you anyhow if I had my way.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never said or felt that you were an idiot, but I have noticed in recent<br/>\nweeks that your attitude toward other players whos level hasn&#39;t caused them<br/>\na nosebleed (under 49 apparently) has deteriorated.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; No disrespect Harmonic, but what is it about level 50 that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; makes players so elitist?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I never went on dragon raids when I was younger, and for a reason.<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ve already stated that reason.  Now, I&#39;ve waited to do this and<br/>\n&gt;   I see why it&#39;s important to do so.  We will not be taking anyone<br/>\n&gt;   less than L49 on any further raids, you have to play elite to beat<br/>\n&gt;   a more elite opponent.  I&#39;m sorry you felt downplayed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Harmonic, don&#39;t forget that although the songs at higher levels have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; improved, our percussion skills are already maxxed at 41.  Our<br/>\n&gt; party buffing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; abilities (other than perhaps by new songs) aren&#39;t going to improve.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Then you don&#39;t understand your songs well enough.  At L50 a bard<br/>\n&gt;   can produce 9 more MR/CR/FR with elemental than a L41 bard, regardless<br/>\n&gt;   of precussion skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Nothing new.<br/>\n&gt;   Nothing new.<br/>\n&gt;   Nothing new, etc.  I will not go on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   You are assuming I&#39;m a complete idiot when it comes to lag.  Let<br/>\n&gt;   me help you out here... There is visual lag (all the crap you are<br/>\n&gt;   stating) and there is server lag.  The location server cannot keep<br/>\n&gt;   pace with 50 or 60 people standing in one place.  It never has,<br/>\n&gt;   even in beta.  Verant simply hasn&#39;t designed the game to accomodate<br/>\n&gt;   that.  I do not get visual lag.  I get server lag.  In fact, to<br/>\n&gt;   the point where I completely crash.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reduce resolution if applicable.  I normally play at 1024x768 on a TNT2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ultra, but reduce to 800x600 for dragons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I have a Diamond V770 TNT2 Ultra, at 640 x 480.  and???  heh<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I don&#39;t mean to sound harsh, but you&#39;ve opened yourself up here<br/>\n&gt;   based on your semi-limited knowledge of myself and my computer<br/>\n&gt;   and my tactics.  Sorry I wasn&#39;t more clear in the beginning.<br/>\n&gt;   You&#39;ve stated nothing new to me here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harm. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
