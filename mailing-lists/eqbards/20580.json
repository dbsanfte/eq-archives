Sure DDD, and CoD do decent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage but avoiding adds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was impossible nearly at that level range.  Now had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lullaby been working I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; imagine I could have pulled it off, but those levels<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were horrific for me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because it was basically:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First off:  At level 18 when I finally got DDD that night I went to the<br/>\ncavern in NRO/EC and fired up DDD with my horn and went to bed for the<br/>\nnight.  When I came home from work the next day my brass skill was maxxed.<br/>\nNo problems with missed notes from then on.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 18 to about 20 or so:<br/>\nN. Karana:  Beetles<br/>\nDDD/CoD/HoR<br/>\nor<br/>\nBellow Kite (ungh slow and painful)<br/>\n   ***<br/>\nNektulos:  Some Guards, Corporals, Steel Golems some Stone Golems<br/>\nDDD/CoD/HoR running tight circles you could keep the golems just out of<br/>\nmelee range and just kill them in droves.<br/>\n   ***<br/>\nGorge of King Xorbb<br/>\nDDD/CoD/HoR<br/>\nMuddites, Mino&#39;s (careful on big ones, sometimes had to zone to runnyeye)<br/>\nI had hand to hand at 100 since level 14 (I started using it in some groups<br/>\nwith all-instrument at level 12)<br/>\n   ***<br/>\nEast Karana<br/>\nDDD/CoD/HoR<br/>\nLions, Spiders, Gnoll Reavers etc.<br/>\n(Pull singles to a zone edge (river, canyon etc) and use all instrument)<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically there wasn&#39;t anything blue I couldn&#39;t handle if I was careful<br/>\nI got about 1.5 bubble of xp per hour.  Went from 18 to 20 in about 3 days<br/>\nRL (3 hrs a night or so)<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 20-24:<br/>\n3 Bird spawn in Lakerathe<br/>\nEast Karana<br/>\nSouth Karana<br/>\nNorth Karana (not griffs)<br/>\n<br/>\nSame tactic as 18-20 except I added Largo&#39;s melodic Binding to the mix<br/>\nDDD/CoD/HoR/LmB<br/>\n<br/>\nThis actually works really well even now at 40.  You can&#39;t do ALL blues with<br/>\nit but you can do most blues with it.  It takes them down slowly but surely<br/>\nand you can even take multiple low blues (2, MAYBE 3) using this tactic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have done this tactic in every zone, including Lower Guk (at 34 or so it<br/>\nbecomes viable against the entry area of dead side)<br/>\n<br/>\nCombined with using Lament to pull you can solo anything that cons blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 26 I don&#39;t think I need to explain how to Fear Kite or how to Charm<br/>\nkite at 27.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
