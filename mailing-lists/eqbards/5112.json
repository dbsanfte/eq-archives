I play a level 17<br/>\nmagician and a level 22 bard and I have noticed the following occurences.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1.  My bard has been missing notes very frequently on songs from lvl3 -<br/>\nlvl22.  This occurs quite frequently even with the lower level songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  My mage now fizzles quite frequently on her bread and butter spells.<br/>\nUnlike a Wizard my mage still uses her lvl 8 shock of blades spell and<br/>\nwill frepuently sit down and cast summons from level 4 group of spells<br/>\n(food, water and bandages).  And she now suffers from numerous fizzles and<br/>\nthis spell has been interrupted. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have talked to a wizard friend of mine and he is noticing that his<br/>\ncasting is now  fizzling/interuppting quite frequently also.  This is<br/>\nleading me to believe that casters are being nerfed in some way.  Has<br/>\nanyone asked their caster friends if they are suffering from the same<br/>\nproblem??  If they are, then casters are being nerfed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver 22nd level bard (almost 23 finally)<br/>\nAariel 17th level Magician (almost 18)<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
