It is not for me or<br/>\n&gt; anyone to decide whether it is fair or unfair.  I agree with the thought<br/>\n&gt; that twinking ruins your experience with your class.  Does wearing a full<br/>\n&gt; suit of bronze at level 1 change your newbie experience?  Of course it<br/>\n&gt; does. Now I have heard arguments being made that the first few levels are<br/>\n&gt; tedious and not worth playing.  Well I believe that would be the wrong way<br/>\n&gt; to look at things.  I myself have played abot 7 characters to level 4-5 to<br/>\n&gt; determine what classes interest me.  Have I twinked any of them, in all<br/>\n&gt; honesty I have twinked one (gave him a dwarven axe, crush&#39;s tunic and 20<br/>\n&gt; plat) and let twinked one just abit (gave her a few pieces of cloth at<br/>\n&gt; level 2-3 and a giant snake fang).  Indeed twinking my ranger made<br/>\n&gt; leveling from 1 to 5 extremely easy, but it in turn made me bored an<br/>\n&gt; unhappy with this character.  Just recently I started a barbarian shaman<br/>\n&gt; and have just gotten him to level 5, and you know what I am very happy<br/>\n&gt; that I didn&#39;t twink him.  I have begun to learn his strengths and weakness<br/>\n&gt; without endangering myself or others too much.  Once again it is your<br/>\n&gt; choice, but it would be a pity for you to reach level 50 without a full<br/>\n&gt; understanding of your class.  People have to remember that many classes<br/>\n&gt; have the unique characteristics that only manifest themselves through<br/>\n&gt; play, and the newbie levels serve as a safe learning ground to understand<br/>\n&gt; your chosen class.  Remember nothing looks more foolish than a<br/>\n&gt; bard who thinks he is a warrior who can play the &quot;Heal Song&quot; at<br/>\n&gt; level 20, a mage who can&#39;t use their pet, or a shaman who only knows how<br/>\n&gt; to heal, burn and cast sow.  Now that would be sad to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Treilanin Loreweaver Bard of the 21st Chorus<br/>\n&gt; Aariel 5th rank Mage of Felwithe<br/>\n&gt; Terak 5th Level Shaman of Halas<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
