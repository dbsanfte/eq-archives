I can tell you as a matter of fact that<br/>\nmost of the poor practices implemented in my code are not of my own volition<br/>\nbut rather because I was told by a producer &quot;do it this way, that&#39;s what so<br/>\nand so decided&quot;. At that point, I find that the producer generally has<br/>\ncomplete resistance to logic or perssuation and the issue is promptly<br/>\nclosed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlame the designers or the middle men that approve the designer&#39;s decisions,<br/>\nbut don&#39;t turn on the poor lowly programmers, it&#39;s probably not thier doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.langlois@...\">mike.langlois@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.langlois@...\">mike.langlois@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 24, 2000 3:45 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Levels after hell levels<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.langlois@...\">mike.langlois@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen this stated a bunch...you&#39;ve never seen the code, correct?<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the interface interaction is incredibly Diku-like, but I<br/>\nimagine<br/>\nthis is similar to Bioware using the D&D game architecture, not the old Gold<br/>\nBox<br/>\ncode.<br/>\nThe game design is obviously based on Diku muds, but the code probably<br/>\nisn&#39;t.<br/>\nAfter all, even adapting a Diku code base for a game like EQ would make it<br/>\npretty unrecognizable, IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a monstrous package, but the amount of real game stopping bugs is very<br/>\nminimal.  Mostly we get trivial bugs that reflect poorly thought out<br/>\nlogistics,<br/>\nnot code.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, even Brian Hook said that they&#39;re a a talented bunch of programmers,<br/>\nand I<br/>\ndoubt you&#39;re unimpressed with his work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I don&#39;t mean this to be harsh, I just wonder what causes us to blame<br/>\nthe<br/>\ncoders rather than the designers.<br/>\n<br/>\nUm, and that sign reversal thing does suck, btw.  You have a point there,<br/>\nbut<br/>\nI&#39;ve done stupid things like that in my code before, and I bet you have, too<br/>\n:P<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my .02<br/>\nGolias, Sol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n===============<br/>\nWhich means that A) They&#39;ve tinkered with the original Diku experience<br/>\ntables (NEEDED!) and B) The Hell levels and the H+1 levels are either<br/>\nextremely intentional or some collosolly bad coding.  I&#39;d personally support<br/>\neither opinion equally.  I&#39;m not that impressed with Verant&#39;s programming<br/>\nprowess.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nPlay Games, Have Fun, Win a Trip ´┐¢ at pogo.com!
