If you have the 53 song, you can reliably mez 3 mobs.<br/>\nWith Pixie Strike, you can only reliably mez 2 mobs.  I would never mix<br/>\ncharming and mezzing and a single bash can really ruin your mezzing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me if there is a 2 pull, I will usually charm (though in Sebillis I now<br/>\njust mez, since too many of th emobs are over lvl 50).<br/>\nIf there is a 3 or 4 pull I mez.  If you are getting 5 pulls you better have<br/>\nan enchanter or a real good rooter...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
