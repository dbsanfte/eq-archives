I personally couldn&#39;t kill Dvinn without getting extremely<br/>\nlucky in a big group.  Why would you want a barbed whip at 150pp if you<br/>\ncould get a dirk at even 50pp unless you just didn&#39;t use piercing weapons?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;J.M. Capozzi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:croak63@...\">croak63@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Dvinn is not the only source of the dirk.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut why anyone thinks paying more than steel weapons prices for weapons that<br/>\nare better than well balanced is a rip-off is beyond me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve seen it advertised from as low as 10pp to 100pp.  The big<br/>\n&gt;difference between the dirk and other special weapons is that<br/>\n&gt;the mob who carries it spawns often, and has it every time.<br/>\n&gt;It is going to cause a serious realignment of prices for<br/>\n&gt;weapons in the L15-25 range.  I personally wouldn&#39;t pay more<br/>\n&gt;than about 15pp for one, maybe 20pp if I were in Qeynos and<br/>\n&gt;needed another ASAP.  Any more than that and it&#39;d be more cost<br/>\n&gt;effective for my friends and me to trek to Crushbone and get<br/>\n&gt;another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
