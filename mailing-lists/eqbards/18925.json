As long as their hosting wasn&#39;t exclusive I guess there&#39;d be<br/>\nno downside but it wouldn&#39;t be very good to see the song list locked<br/>\naway on a site that hardly anyone goes to due to it&#39;s mostly out of date<br/>\ninfo.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck their bard song list, hidden away under strategy and<br/>\nstatistics(tm)-&gt;class articles-&gt;bard spell list. They have 20 songs.<br/>\nI guess it&#39;s nice that they are looking for a better list now but my<br/>\nquestion would be; why, after over a year of total neglect, are they<br/>\nbothering?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, May 23/00, &quot;Reeves, Patrick W&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I received an email last night from Manga of the EverQuest Stratics site.<br/>\n&gt; They are interested in hosting the Song Analysis on their network.
