Or do i really suck.  When I have a good connection and low <br/>\nlag I keep four going with few drops...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one song per hotkey, and I hit 1122334411223344...<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing something here?  Should I set up hotkeys so that one casts two <br/>\nsongs with appropriate delays?  I&#39;ve never like that idea because it gives <br/>\nme less flexibility... but now I begin to wonder.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is this bs...<br/>\n<br/>\nVery curious to hear what y&#39;all have to say<br/>\n<br/>\nRaub Zaumbie<br/>\n38 :-) E.
