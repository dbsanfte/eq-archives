Though in another two levels Hymn,<br/>\nChords of Dissonance, and Bellow with a stringed instrument starts to<br/>\nbecome more effective for soloing.  I still use that combo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Also, how hard is it to get that other level 9 song I heard can<br/>\nonly be gotten in Luclin, &quot;Magical Monologue&quot;  (of course I&#39;ll have<br/>\nto buy the exp first) so that i can save my Platinum and not have to<br/>\nbuy a magic weapon?<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Good question.  I got to get me that still.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Also Also does the bellow that bards get at lvl 12 affect<br/>\ncreatures that can only be hit with magic weapons, and does that song<br/>\nshow you how much dammage you are delivering (whereas the chords of<br/>\ndisonance only say &quot;Large Spider winces&quot; etc)?<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Bellow is a magic attack, yes.  I believe a somewhat recent patch added<br/>\nthe damage done by the song to the text box message.  Something like &quot;A<br/>\nlarge spider was hit by 9 points of non-melee damage&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 18 songs, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
