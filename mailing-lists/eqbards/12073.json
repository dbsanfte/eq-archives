They see the Hymn icon but no Clarity<br/>\nicon and they start saying &quot;Mana song!  Mana song!  WTF!?!?&quot;  I&#39;ve had guys<br/>\n*disband* calling me &quot;incompetent&quot; because I wouldn&#39;t sing pure Clarity, but<br/>\ninsisted on continuing to sing [Clarity, Clarity, Hymn...] when the tanks<br/>\nwere a half-bubble of HPs low.  I have yet to find a way to talk to these<br/>\npig-headed morons (and yes, they&#39;re almost always Wizards).
