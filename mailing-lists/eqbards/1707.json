I choose not to wear plate<br/>\nbecause it doesn&#39;t fit my role-playing image of a bard, period.  I also<br/>\nagree with the previous post where not one person has given a valid<br/>\nrole-playing reason for wearing plate as a bard, although I think there are<br/>\nsome, but those are not the kind of posts we are seeing.  Instead we see<br/>\nmore, &quot;Oh yeah but...&quot; type of posts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeaven forbid someone should make your character weaker in order to further<br/>\natmosphere or enhance the storyline.  In fact if all characters could do<br/>\neverything we&#39;d all be perfectly balanced, and perfectly boring.
