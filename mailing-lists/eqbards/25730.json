How much can I expect to pay for a weapon that <br/>\n&gt; will do the trick?  I am on a tight budget right now, what with <br/>\n&gt; buying songs and learning to smith :)  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, when soloing which do you prefer: Anthem de arms, or Whistling <br/>\n&gt; warsong?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also Also, how hard is it to get that other level 9 song I heard can <br/>\n&gt; only be gotten in Luclin, &quot;Magical Monologue&quot;  (of course I&#39;ll have <br/>\n&gt; to buy the exp first) so that i can save my Platinum and not have to <br/>\n&gt; buy a magic weapon?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also Also Also does the bellow that bards get at lvl 12 affect <br/>\n&gt; creatures that can only be hit with magic weapons, and does that song <br/>\n&gt; show you how much dammage you are delivering (whereas the chords of <br/>\n&gt; disonance only say &quot;Large Spider winces&quot; etc)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -fohat, level 10 half-elf Quelious Bard on Firiona Vie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
