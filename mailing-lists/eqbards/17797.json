Why give them the ability to interact this way at<br/>\nall?  It like taking your kid into a candy store and leaving him alone<br/>\nthere, with no supervision and telling him not to eat any candy.  It makes<br/>\nno sense.  I&#39;ve seen guides and Gm&#39;s interacting in these ways with the<br/>\nplayers and the world all the time.  I have an older copy of the Guide regs,<br/>\nit does state you are not to fight with other players but it in no way leads<br/>\nyou to believe that this is one of the &quot;10 commandments&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Perhaps a Princess...

Killing a player is not considered a minor infraction to Guides.<br/>\nIt is one of the first things I was told by a Guide friend that they<br/>\nCOULD NOT do. No spells, no fighting players, no interacting with the <br/>\nworld in other than talking at ALL.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Kimes, Dean W.
