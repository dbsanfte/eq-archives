When I got on the island there was no one else<br/>\n&gt;there.  I explored it but soon realized that I wasn&#39;t much for me to do on<br/>\n&gt;the island.  The kerrans were all either blue or green and conned<br/>\n&gt;indifferently to me.  I had no reason to attack them so decided to just wait<br/>\n&gt;for the next boat.  While I was waiting, I decided to attack some fire<br/>\n&gt;beetles to pass the time.  I figured I could sell the eyes for some pocket<br/>\n&gt;change.  To my surprise, every kerran on the island started racing towards<br/>\n&gt;to punish me for attacking the fire beetles.  Knowing that I couldn&#39;t kill<br/>\n&gt;them all, I pulled out the drum and started running around the island.  I<br/>\n&gt;was able to outrun them and pretty soon every kerran on the island was<br/>\n&gt;chasing me.  I was running so fast, I eventually started lapping the kerrans<br/>\n&gt;at the end of the train.  Like Forrest Gump, I just kept on running.  After<br/>\n&gt;about 30 or so laps around the island, I saw the boat approach the dock.  On<br/>\n&gt;the next lap, I quickly jumped on the boat.  Fortunately for me, none of the<br/>\n&gt;kerrans followed me onto the boat.  I guess there is some code in the game<br/>\n&gt;that prevents mobs from getting on the boat.  After giving thanks to<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane, I quaffed a few Fierce Brews for the ride to Erudin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can just see it now: Galtin Gump of E&#39;ci<br/>\n;)<br/>\nTalies</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
