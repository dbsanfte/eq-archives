It should be a pretty good item.  AC 10 for a shoulder slot item is<br/>\n&#39;ok&#39; (crafted pauldrons is better; even crested is better). Dex/Agi +9 would<br/>\nbe damn nice if those stats did anything. HP +50 &lt;cough&gt; what is the HP buff<br/>\nfrom a Bloodstone symbol? Jasper? Peridot? And Sv FIRE + 15 is damn nice but<br/>\nwere they thinking this will be usefull for camping Naggy?  You need the<br/>\nFire resist before you take Naggy not after &lt;sheesh&gt; And Haste is damn nice<br/>\neffect no matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like they had some idea about dex/agi/str etc all being meaningful but<br/>\nsomehow lost something along the way.  Any item boosters they give to HP or<br/>\nMana are all jokes.  Except mana stones - which they scared them selves<br/>\nwith.  Did GZ &quot;stone down&quot; and kill himself the night before he decides it&#39;s<br/>\ntoo powerfull and should be out of the game???<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like they had some ideas but did not quite get everyone on the same<br/>\npage when stuff got coded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I ranting again?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
