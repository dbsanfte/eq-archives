When grouped with people 4 levels above me, if we<br/>\nkilled something green to them but blue to me, they got no experience but I<br/>\ndid receive experience. Can&#39;t confirm whether I got it all, though. And<br/>\neveryone contributed to the kill. And when grouped with people a couple<br/>\nlevels lower, stuff that was green to me gave me no xp, but my groupmates<br/>\ndid receive experience. I&#39;ve seen it from both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt must be related to the gap in levels. You must be within a third of the<br/>\nhighest person (66% or higher is the figure I&#39;ve seen posted here) to ever<br/>\nreceive any experience. When I grouped with Sylly she was 32 and I was 14, I<br/>\nthink. I never received xp. I was too far away from her in levels. If I were<br/>\n21st level I bet I would have received xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\nPondering Powerleveling<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Christine &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christine@...\">christine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 5:32 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Some questions about Experience (off-topic)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Christine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christine@...\">christine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree with Thormeal here - I have a level 33 ranger that has been<br/>\ngrouped<br/>\n&gt; with a level 9 paladin for a few days (doing a quest) and I will say that<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; I kill something green to me, he will not get exp if we are grouped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The confusion comes because if HE kills something, and I assist in no way<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; the fight (I assume bard songs would be considered assisting, but I did<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; with my ranger so can&#39;t say for sure) he will get the exp he normally<br/>\nwould,<br/>\n&gt; even if we are grouped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Daleia d&#39;Allaney<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That is, of course, innacurate (Verrant won&#39;t let something like this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;happen).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;A high level tank will taunt the MOB off a low level character for him to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kill it.
