Anyways, we were really disorganized on one<br/>\nof our last pulls and everyone almost died.  This giant had a really high<br/>\nresist rate to the druid (level 39)  and to me (level 30).    it kept<br/>\nresisting his snare and a few times his spells, and eventually to get it off<br/>\nhim we got it on us. we dished out a fare amount of damage but me and the<br/>\nmonk almost died, had to retreat a few times with guitar in hand playing<br/>\nheal.  and at one point it went really ballistic on the monk, the monk<br/>\ncouldnt feign death successfully against it and was down to half a bubble of<br/>\nhealth and i was fairly far away.  I ran towards him right away and tried a<br/>\ncharm just incase i succeeded.  Well with him at less then half a bubble of<br/>\nhealth, i charmed it and then pulled it away from him while the druid medded<br/>\nup while i would kite it around while healing.  We then finished it off and<br/>\nabout 2 minutes after our wolf form wore off.    Needless to say everyone<br/>\nwas really releived when it died.  Then while healing the monk says he&#39;s<br/>\nhappy his feign death worked, i told him it didnt work, i just missed having<br/>\na pocket giant as a pet.  Charm is a great way to fight kill stealers and<br/>\nalso a great way to save party members as monsters really really hate you<br/>\nafter you use it. (last charmed giant before this got me killled).<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin Nehoc<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\nlevel 30 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tAugust 31, 1999 1:49 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] SoW vs. Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 31 Aug 1999, Abraham Hardjana wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and a mage totally lagged last night.  I know in truth that Selo&#39;s is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wonderful tool, but I have also learned that SOW can be a good send for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the rest of your party.  When running you will have to keep close tabs<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all of the party members because it is eay to lose them.  So it is a<br/>\n&gt; toss<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and will depend on the situation.  BTW you are correct about the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unrooting, but it will become a moot point once you start camping a room<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When the group has SoW available, I usually go with it.<br/>\n&gt; Retreats are rarely organized and people tend to break off at<br/>\n&gt; different times.  If everyone is SoW&#39;ed, I don&#39;t have to wait<br/>\n&gt; around for everyone else to leave first, so I am at less risk.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m finding this to be more important now that I can&#39;t tank as<br/>\n&gt; well as the other true tanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I will still keep Accelerando memorized and the drum ready<br/>\n&gt; though.  The obvious use is for unrooting people.  But another<br/>\n&gt; use is that SoW walking is barely faster than monsters.<br/>\n&gt; Accelerando with a drum while walking is significantly faster.<br/>\n&gt; So if any of your party is down to a bubble or less and is<br/>\n&gt; walking, you can use Accelerando with a drum to give him<br/>\n&gt; enough speed to escape without getting hit from behind 3-4<br/>\n&gt; times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
