You think you want","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-661024039\">One big problem is the items that were nifty and new to you when you first<br/>\ngot them at 21st are items we bought when we were 12th level.  You think you<br/>\nwant new loot?  Since nothing ever decays in the game the mobs we now fight<br/>\ncarry loot we have used and in some cases discarded several levels ago.  I<br/>\nhad the same weapons at 12th level that I did at 19th level because they<br/>\nwere easily affordable at 12th even though they came off of mobs I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nhope to face for another 6+ levels.  The only way I can get any new<br/>\ninteresting loot at this point is to buy it or camp one of the ultra-rare<br/>\nspawns for days on end.  EQ is the perfect example of a trickle-down<br/>\neconomy.  Too bad we mid-levels would love to have something we could earn<br/>\ndirectly.  We have the same problem you do at lvl 50.  I don&#39;t really care<br/>\nall that much about xp either.  Getting xp is boring unless like sitting at<br/>\nthe same place for weeks on end killing the same things over and over again.<br/>\ni too would like to get some nifty new stuff.  Unfortunately anything that<br/>\nwould be new to me is from mobs 10 levels higher than I am.<br/>\nBsically the problem is the same but for different reasons.  You want items<br/>\nnot xp because xp does you no good.  I want items not xp because I find EQ&#39;s<br/>\nway of getting xp quickly very boring.  Nifty new items are kinda cool, but<br/>\npresently unavailable.  Of course if they did open a new zone for level<br/>\n20-30 all the 50&#39;s would swarm in and kill everything just to see what it<br/>\ndropped anyhow so I still wouldn&#39;t find anything new.  Maybe they need to<br/>\nmake a new zone with a level maximum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Naeeldar [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 24, 2000 2:00 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know but then again us 50&#39;s played with less then you have now you guys<br/>\njust want some new stuff I just need a place to hunt and I&#39;ve got a 21<br/>\nshaman right now. There is plenty of places to hunt and there are quests<br/>\nhere and there but the bottom line is you guys can play  it&#39;s getting to be<br/>\nunplayable now to wherem ost people don&#39;t pla ytheir main chars at all or<br/>\nrarely rather because of overcrowding.

I also think its one<br/>\n&gt;of those threads where both sides of the argument are correct.  As a 50th<br/>\n&gt;level character, Naeeldar&#39;s opinion is the the #1 problem with EQ is that<br/>\n&gt;there isn&#39;t enough stuff for 50th level players to do.  I agree with him<br/>\n&gt;100%.  As a 32d level player, my opinion is that the #1 problem with EQ is<br/>\n&gt;that Verant seems to be neglecting the 46- players.  By this I mean there<br/>\n&gt;are a lot of areas in the game that need to be fixed, i.e. more quality<br/>\n&gt;quests, new items for medium level characters, bugs, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bottom line is that if EQ is gonna remain profitable over the next few<br/>\n&gt;years, both areas need to be fixed.  Verant has stated that they have<br/>\n&gt;multiple teams working on different areas (expansion, fixing current game,<br/>\n&gt;etc).  It just seems to me that all improvements to the game are geared<br/>\n&gt;toward keeping the 46+ players happy (i.e. all the teams really working on<br/>\n&gt;the same thing) and not fixing the stuff broken in the current game.  IMO,<br/>\n&gt;fixing whats broken in the current game and adding new content (quality<br/>\n&gt;quests) is more appropriate for the long term health of the game.  Now the<br/>\n&gt;counter argument is that if the level 50 players don&#39;t have something to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>do,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;they will cancel their subscription. Here&#39;s my opinion on that.  At some<br/>\n&gt;point in time, I think you just have to say its time to hang up the spurs<br/>\n&gt;and move on.  Either you start another character or you move on to another<br/>\n&gt;game.  Like Kitasi said in his post, the programmers will never be able to<br/>\n&gt;keep up with the level 50 players.  The expansion will only be a short term<br/>\n&gt;fix.  Assuming EQ2 is several years down the road, fixing the current game<br/>\n&gt;(bugs) and adding new content (for everyone level 1-50) is the only viable<br/>\n&gt;option from a business perspective IMO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Actually I think Verant is missing the point there.  They will never be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; able<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to do enough to keep up with the level 50 players unless they totally<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ignore<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the lower level players.  The majority of the level 50 players play the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; game<br/>\n&gt;&gt; far too much for Verant to be able to keep up wit providing them new<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stuff.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Although those players play the game more they don&#39;t pay any more than<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; lower level players.  I have lost close to 20 guild members just in my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; guild<br/>\n&gt;&gt; because they were tired of Verant only doing things for level 46+<br/>\n </span></blockquote>players.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Eventually at this rate Verant will only have those level 46+ players<br/>\n&gt;&gt; left.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Kit<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Actually you get to play a new class so not boring. They have to fix<br/>\n&gt;&gt; overcrowding with high levels first and their is no reason they should<br/>\n&gt;&gt; bother with anything else until that happens otherwise Verant will lose a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; good percentage of their customers.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
