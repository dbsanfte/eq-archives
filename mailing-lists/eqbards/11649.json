One of the best sites for maps that I have found<br/>\nis the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/indexe.html\">http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/indexe.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\tMost of it is in Japanese and there are few points of interest marked on<br/>\nthe maps but as far as finding your way around it is damn near perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI also do not know where the Assassin is but people who hunt the Supplier<br/>\nalso seem to hunt the Assassin at the same time so they must be relatively<br/>\nclose. On Maps&#39; Guk Bottom Dead Side the Basalts are in the area with the<br/>\n&#39;A&#39; and the Supplier is in the square room above the &#39;To B1&#39;. I&#39;d guess the<br/>\nAssassin would be somewhere between the &#39;To B1&#39; and &#39;C&#39; maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnother good spot for maps is this place:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.medvecky.com/EQ/NOREQMaps.htm\">http://www.medvecky.com/EQ/NOREQMaps.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis is basically a collection of different maps from different people<br/>\nincluding many from the Japanese site above.
