I start to see<br/>\nthings on tracking as early as 7pm and by 9pm the list is full. One pull at<br/>\n9pm by RV zone and enough other stuff agros on our fites until the they quit<br/>\nspawning around 4am to 6am.  From then til 10 or noonish, you need a cleric<br/>\nor pallie to cast sense undead which will see the few that are left over -<br/>\nbut beware sense undead will see all the way across the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went out to pull for a day time kill and managed to snag not one but two<br/>\nenraged dread wolf puppys.  Fortunately, I managed to run - but got a bit<br/>\nlost and just ran the first zone wall I hit (from between HH and WC going<br/>\npast the lake) until I found an exit (WC zone.)  I didn&#39;t see anyone else<br/>\nbut if I had it woulda been a mess for them.   I have snagged OPT&#39;s (other<br/>\nplayer&#39;s trains) in the same manner.  Running the wall, see some one go by,<br/>\nwonder where is he going in such a hurry, wonder hmm where did this Zombie<br/>\ntrooper come from???<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, run the wall at night if you dare - but mobs path all the way to the<br/>\nwall and players will train to zones - no two ways about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tBrangwen [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brangwen@...\">brangwen@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tSaturday, November 06, 1999 6:46 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Kith Nerfed!!!
