By the time we reach him, all<br/>\nthat is left is 2 Bok Knights, The Ghoul Lord, and his pet.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just HOW TOUGH is the Ghoul Lord? Is there another critter he can be<br/>\nequally compared to? How about the Bok Knights? Any suggestions?

(Yes,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mithril and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a few other pieces are better but are only wearable by a few, for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; example we bards cannot wear Mithril).  And, it is only found in one<br/>\n&gt;&gt; place.  And, it is a rare drop.  What this means is that there will<br/>\n&gt;&gt; NEVER be enough ruby to go around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bards can wear mithril breastplate and the bracers.
