In fact, I even made a social key.  But it is<br/>\nstill great fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the story:  <br/>\n<br/>\nLate one night, early 4th of July weekend, me and couple of my fiends are in<br/>\nRivervale begging for a bind.  I see Silvera Tinkerbelle who I know from a<br/>\nserver email list and run over to say &quot;hi I just wanted to meet you!&quot; (She<br/>\nis lev 48 or 49 and I am impressed!)  She actually talks to me and I nearly<br/>\nfaint!  Well, we do some duck dancing and other stoopid char tricks and<br/>\ngenerally hang out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she inspects my equipment and goes: &quot;Greetings Sylly, looks like you<br/>\ncould use some armor?&quot;  I say: &quot;Well yes, if you know anyone selling banded,<br/>\nI do have some plats saved up.&quot; She says come to the bank and lemme look<br/>\nwhat I might have... Then my trade screen come up and she drops in a couple<br/>\nof pieces of stuff I don&#39;t even recognize. Then she fills the trade screen<br/>\nand says &#39;take&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point - I say to her &quot;ya know I am way too low level for this...&quot;<br/>\nAnd she says &quot;I will understand if you say no...&quot;  But I think - hey this is<br/>\nthe chance of a life time! So I take!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she fills the trade screen a second time and I am frantically looking<br/>\nto see if I got nuff slots and destroying all my food and beetle eyes. She<br/>\nsays take.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is how the Bronze bard was born (I even told her: &quot;I will have to<br/>\ncall you Silvera Twinkerbelle from now on&quot; and she goes LOL!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether it&#39;s for penance for my sins or what - one of my &#39;things&#39; is I will<br/>\nmake free patch work armor for young adventurers.  If they bring me skins,<br/>\nfine otherwise ill even buy em and make.  I really enjoy helping the young<br/>\nones get a start.  Patch is the best thing for new adventurers and I try to<br/>\nhelp as many as I can.  Casters - you need to go to Millers by Surefall<br/>\ntunnel in Qeynos Hills and get them to make you stuff - casters can wear and<br/>\nit has AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nA long time ago, I saw a guy in all banded running back to the guards at T2.<br/>\nI thot that was too ridiculous and posted a rant on some web site about<br/>\ntwinking.  This was back when I thought you should stand toe to toe with the<br/>\nmonsters and fight for your honor! Well, now I am the one in all bronze<br/>\nrunning for the zone yelping &quot;trin tran train to the zone@!@<br/>\n&lt;mailto:zone@!@&gt; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMore and more are bronze is coming out now and I have made some decent<br/>\nlevels so my days as a spectacle are nearly over &lt;sigh&gt; I am going to miss<br/>\nall the attention! <br/>\n<br/>\n/ooc you are NOT anonymous on the internet - you are who you are!  What ever<br/>\nyou do is how people will know you.  I have many friends in char and love<br/>\nmeeting new people.  I thank you for seeing the real me - I am a bronze<br/>\ntwink no denying that but I also try to do other stuff and keep things for<br/>\neveryone!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 17th level<br/>\na.k.a.
