I noticed a decrease in prices,<br/>\nby about 1g or so for some of the higher lvl songs she sells.<br/>\nThat was it, I&#39;ve never been able to get it to work again.<br/>\nThe guildmaster won&#39;t talk to me about the quest (since I&#39;m human i<br/>\nsuppose) so I tried using Carillon on her 10 times or so, and she still<br/>\nrefused to talk to me.<br/>\nSo with my experience, the song DID in fact work. But once, and only<br/>\nonce.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Libretto, aye, its quite worthless indeed. We need to bug the GMs<br/>\nabout these two songs. Please fill out some /feedback forms or email<br/>\nthem or whatever. Petition if you want to. Otherwise these<br/>\nbugged/worthless songs will remain just as that: bugged/worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
