I&#39;ve got a ykesha for my<br/>\nprimary, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m willing to do that camp again for a while.<br/>\nThe ebw seems like a good choice for a secondary weapon anyway since its<br/>\nfaster than the ykesha, and off hand proc&#39;s never seem to happen much for<br/>\nme.<br/>\nAnyway, not having a whole lot of experience with MM, I know how to get to<br/>\nthe maid and butler rooms, but I&#39;m not really very familiar with spawns and<br/>\naggro radius&#39; in there, I was just wondering if anyone can offer any advice.<br/>\nWhere is the best/safest place to camp?  Can I do it solo, or should I bring<br/>\nalong anyone else?  About how long does it take on average to get both<br/>\nfangs?<br/>\nAny advice would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 50 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
