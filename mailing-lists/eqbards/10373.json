As far as<br/>\ngriffawns go I was Kiteing them at 17 useing CoD, Bellows, Selos.  But they<br/>\nare pretty slow so you should have no problem. thing about them tho..when i<br/>\nkited kodiaks and such i would run around trees and such so it was harder<br/>\nfor them to get to me. Griffawns was diffrent since they fly. they didnt<br/>\nseem impeaded with my attempt to get them to slow down by running them<br/>\nthrough trees. Hope this information helps you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTearian Valmont of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Cool :)<br/>\n&gt; No one knows the dmg equation for CoD?  Thats actually one of the more<br/>\n&gt; important ones =)  I&#39;ve been kiting yellow gorge hounds at level 15 (just<br/>\n&gt; got 16) and wasn&#39;t able to tell if weaving selos/bellow/cod was better<br/>\n </span></blockquote>than<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; selos/bellow/bellow (using strings).  Any help is appreciated...oh, anyone<br/>\n&gt; know if I would be able to kite griffawns like this?   I hear they run the<br/>\n&gt; same speed as hounds, and I never actually get hit while kiting...I just<br/>\n&gt; sorta run around in a circle to the beat of my own footsteps =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks again,<br/>\n&gt; Taluvil </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
