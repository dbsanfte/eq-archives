I have been in a lot of groups with<br/>\ntwo bards and it is great.  I&#39;d love to get in a group with Galtin and you<br/>\nsometime I think we would be very deadly.  Although I think the enchanter<br/>\nwould have found that using his two very cheap stun spells would have even<br/>\nmade the slaughter more amusing.  Three bards would definitely be a hoot,<br/>\ngood grief think of the clarity effects at 32!  Three bards and two nukers<br/>\nwith an enchanter would be scary indeed.  I don&#39;t think two many servers<br/>\nhave as many bards as we do on E&#39;ci though.

I was invited to join them.  So<br/>\nour group was 3 bards, warrior, and enchanter.  All of us bards were around<br/>\nlevel 25, so it worked out where we actually had enough songs for all of us<br/>\nto twist 3 songs each.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe enchanter was giving everyone alacrity, but other than that, he was just<br/>\nmedding.  Why?  There was nothing else for him to really do.  He commented<br/>\non that at one point, and my fellow bard guildmate said, &quot;Sit, med, enjoy<br/>\nthe ride!&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in this group, it wasn&#39;t the bard who was useless, it was the enchanter.<br/>\nJust thought it was funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nGilgurth<br/>\nBard of 26 Winces<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet Your FREE Online Credit Report!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5783/13/_/451022/_/962310493/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5783/13/_/451022/_/962310493/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFree @Backup service!
