While it was charmed our rogue would disarm the guard. When it<br/>\nbecame uncharmed, it would bee line for me, but i&#39;d play fear song and the<br/>\nclerics were stunning it, never in these fights we&#39;d lose over a bubble of<br/>\nhealth, then after fight i reduce down time.    I went afk for about half an<br/>\nhour last night and the group was practically crying for my return, they<br/>\nwere getting beat down really bad in my absence.  When i got back they were<br/>\nlike a bunch of junkies that just got  a good fix (mana regen)<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on that night i was speaking with one of the clerics for over an hour<br/>\nand he couldnt beleive how much bards rocked more once they got the mana<br/>\nregen song, he couldnt beleive how much more i was pulling my weight now. It<br/>\nfelt good to finally feel needed in the group.  But back to the fight, the<br/>\nsnare, fear and stun are great tactic for wide open spaces and our rogue<br/>\nloved it as it was great for his backstabs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nSol ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tElijah Meeker [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSeptember 17, 1999 12:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Bard only equipment, a rant<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But the fact is in the EQ world we are becoming woefully underpowered.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I disagree, I have yet to see some manner in which I am &quot;underpowered&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; okay solo (once I figured out how) I do over 1000pts damage in 36 seconds<br/>\n&gt; (on a pull of 5 mobs) I give our group a major decrease in down time. I am<br/>\n&gt; just not seeing it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Case in point the new SOW problem, the Z-axis bug, and there are more.<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; fact is I love being a bard because of WHAT a bard is.. not because of<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; Verant made the bard.  It is evident that bards are being treated as a<br/>\n&gt; second class, class.  What other class has had their spell deliberatly<br/>\n&gt; placed as lesser value?  Our cancelling SOW was a fluke.. SoW overpowering<br/>\n&gt; Accel was not an accident.  And WHY would you prefer SOW to Accel?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh pshaw, it&#39;s a bug, it&#39;s clearly a bug. They have a poorly modeled speed<br/>\n&gt; data structure and they keep tweeking it (I can almost visualize it now<br/>\n&gt; after all these changes). It&#39;s broke, it will be fixed. Petition it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; bard only weapons.  I would like to see the quest system fixed.. I&#39;d like<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; see some more special items for bards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; agreed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; .  I&#39;d like to see some more useful songs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have to figure out all th euses for the songs I have...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;And I&#39;ld like to see them stop nerfing us without reguard to the results.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have yet to see proof it is an intentional nerf.
