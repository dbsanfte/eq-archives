This illusion has been around since early Beta.<br/>\nIt has a lot to do with texture sizes.  Some areas of the game have very<br/>\nlarge textures, which, because they&#39;re not as tightly packed, will give you<br/>\nthe illusion of moving slower.  Kind of like if you are in a car and look<br/>\ndown at the dotted lines RIGHT beside the car will seem like they&#39;re flying<br/>\nby at mach 10 but if you look ahead of the car a bit they will look much<br/>\nslower.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you play a large race (ogre/troll/barb) you will also notice that they<br/>\nseem slower than smaller races (from perspective) but still seem to manage<br/>\nto keep up.  It&#39;s a perspective thing and an illusion caused by texture<br/>\nsizes.  Nothing is wrong with our song or SoW.  The easiest/fastest way to<br/>\nconfirm is to find a druid running around with SoW and blow his doors off.<br/>\nRestores my confidence every time ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLuck and may your voice never fail!<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am starting to hear reports of problems with SoW that have been bugging<br/>\n </span></blockquote>me<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;for a while now with Selos but I have not been certain it wasn&#39;t just a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;perception thing.
