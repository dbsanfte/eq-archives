I did try it out<br/>\nusing chords of dissodance and selo&#39;s but it seemed to take forever<br/>\nto kill something that I could kill much faster with my weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is...how viable is soloing with just instruments and<br/>\ndo I just not have the effective offensive song yet for doing so?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all and if you see Brhianna on Innoruuk running for her life<br/>\nand strumming her lute madly wave hello!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 14<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 23 Jan 2001 11:03:03 -1000<br/>\n   From: Reece Tom R CPT 25 ID L G4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: Question on &quot;Drafting&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell first off you didn&#39;t say what level your own character was.  He has to<br/>\nbe high enough level to get EXP when grouped with a level 53.  Off the top<br/>\nof my head, I don&#39;t know what the minimum level required to get EXP when<br/>\ngrouped with a level 53 is.  I would guess you have to be at least in your<br/>\n40s.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming you are high enough level, your % split of EXP would be X/X+53.<br/>\nThis is the base EXP amount you receive.  The group bonus, class bonus, and<br/>\nzone bonus get added to the base value to determine total EXP received per<br/>\nkill.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder the new system, lower level characters get a higher % split of EXP<br/>\nwhen grouping with higher level character than they did under the old<br/>\nsystem.  I have actually been in a group that did not want to add someone<br/>\nlower level because the person would steal EXP from them.

I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;stops&quot; - if you mean<br/>\n&quot;Partials&quot; you have it backwards - only brass instruments have partials.<br/>\nRegardless, the determination of instrument types is by how the sound itself<br/>\nis generated.  For brass instruments - the players lips vibration creates<br/>\nthe sound.  This is how you play a Shofar (when I was a child - a big day<br/>\nfor me was when for the first time I beat the Rabbi&#39;s son in a<br/>\nShofar-blowing competition - after I started taking trombone lessons).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a woodwind instrument - the sound is created by some part of the<br/>\ninstrument vibrating.  On modern instruments - with the exception of the<br/>\nflute this would be a reed (for a flute it&#39;s the vibrations caused by the<br/>\nwind crossing its mouthpiece<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA saxophone - for example - while made of brass is a woodwind<br/>\ninstrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a brass player - we<br/>\nare creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies the sound.<br/>\nThis is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search of a good<br/>\nreed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get one or two in a<br/>\nbox of 20 - they are happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

First of all I<br/>\nlove my bard!

Right now I have soloed mainly with my weapon damage and<br/>\nsinging.  But I have read a few posts about bards soloing with<br/>\ninstruments only and that it is very effective.  I did try it out<br/>\nusing chords of dissodance and selo&#39;s but it seemed to take forever<br/>\nto kill something that I could kill much faster with my weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is...how viable is soloing with just instruments and<br/>\ndo I just not have the effective offensive song yet for doing so?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all and if you see Brhianna on Innoruuk running for her life<br/>\nand strumming her lute madly wave hello!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith<br/>\nthe subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 21<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 23 Jan 2001 14:27:13 -0700<br/>\n   From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: Portal in EW at the Dead Dragon???<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL!

Another option would be for the<br/>\nbard to camp as soon as he dropped the mob off at the camp. This would work<br/>\nassuming you can camp out before the raid members killed the mob. Anyone<br/>\nknow if these two options will work? Any other options?<br/>\nIn every major raid I have attended, I almost always end up playing mana<br/>\nbattery or resist buffer. This is all fine and dandy, but getting to be main<br/>\nscout/puller for a major raid sounds like it would be a lot of fun.<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 8<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 24 Jan 2001 08:22:05 -0500<br/>\n   From: Christopher Sanders &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christopher.sanders@...\">christopher.sanders@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: OT Instruments (was complete heal)<br/>\n<br/>\nROFL<br/>\n<br/>\nMe and you, Halana/Tani.  :)  I just skim these.

I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;stops&quot; -<br/>\n&gt; if you mean<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Partials&quot; you have it backwards - only brass instruments<br/>\n&gt; have partials.<br/>\n&gt; Regardless, the determination of instrument types is by how<br/>\n&gt; the sound itself<br/>\n&gt; is generated.  For brass instruments - the players lips<br/>\n&gt; vibration creates<br/>\n&gt; the sound.  This is how you play a Shofar (when I was a child<br/>\n&gt; - a big day<br/>\n&gt; for me was when for the first time I beat the Rabbi&#39;s son in a<br/>\n&gt; Shofar-blowing competition - after I started taking trombone lessons).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a woodwind instrument - the sound is created by some part of the<br/>\n&gt; instrument vibrating.  On modern instruments - with the<br/>\n&gt; exception of the<br/>\n&gt; flute this would be a reed (for a flute it&#39;s the vibrations<br/>\n&gt; caused by the<br/>\n&gt; wind crossing its mouthpiece<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tA saxophone - for example - while made of brass is a woodwind<br/>\n&gt; instrument.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a<br/>\n&gt; brass player - we<br/>\n&gt; are creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies<br/>\n&gt; the sound.<br/>\n&gt; This is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search<br/>\n&gt; of a good<br/>\n&gt; reed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get<br/>\n&gt; one or two in a<br/>\n&gt; box of 20 - they are happy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.
