Very nice job, very<br/>\nclose to what I originally had in mind for when I HTMLized<br/>\nit.  There are a couple mistakes here and there, I will send<br/>\nyou a list later (maybe tonight) when I&#39;ve had a chance to<br/>\nread everything.  The most obvious one is that the slowdown<br/>\nfor Chain/Binding is -30%, not -20%.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious why you removed the instrument effect notes.  I<br/>\nput that there to make it easier for people to decide whether<br/>\nto use weapons or switch to instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
