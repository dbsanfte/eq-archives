If you have a problem with acronyms, just do what I do when I have a problem with something in the game...IGNORE IT...What you cant see cant hurt you, so to speak (Purely in terms of text, not the spectre behind you sucking your will to live)<br/>\nAnd, as with any profession, acronyms make things easier.
