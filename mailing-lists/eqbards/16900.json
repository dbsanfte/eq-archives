You can run all you want and the mob will still have no<br/>\n&gt; problems hitting you.  If there&#39;s no speed difference, a mob<br/>\n&gt; aggros on a caster, and the caster runs around, all he does is<br/>\n&gt; make it take *longer* for the others to get it off him than if<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;d just stood there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually there is a trick to go just a little faster than Jboots and a<br/>\nlittle slower than SoW when you run.  I won&#39;t go into what it is because<br/>\nit&#39;s SO useful for non-SOW classes that I&#39;d hate to see it get &quot;Fixed&quot; by<br/>\nVerant.  Basically once I figured out how to do this my SK stopped dying ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd... it works INDOORS too ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Even if the mob is snared or you&#39;re SoWed, it&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt; generally a poor practice to run since it makes it harder for<br/>\n&gt; the tanks to hit it, which increases the time it takes to kill<br/>\n&gt; the mob, which lowers the number of mobs you can kill per<br/>\n&gt; hour.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very true ;)  And I agree.  If something jumps you in a group do NOT run.<br/>\nLet the group deal with it.  Worst case, you die.   You probably woulda died<br/>\nANYWAY but at least this way you don&#39;t get the group in an uproar and maybe<br/>\ncause a couple extra deaths that wouldn&#39;t have happened if ya&#39;d stayed put.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, in groups I am in, if the caster starts running around when a<br/>\nmob jumps them we give them 1 more chance.  If they do it again we disband<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ L</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
