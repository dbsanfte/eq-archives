This reminds me far too much of the same kind of arrogance<br/>\nthat we&#39;ve seen from Verant, where they quite clearly seem to think<br/>\nthey&#39;ve made a near perfect game if people would just play it the way<br/>\nthey were supposed to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Sep 08/00, &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Yes, and no.  I don&#39;t think they believe that their PvP environment will be<br/>\n&gt; perfect, but they think it will be good.  I like the concept behind it and<br/>\n&gt; generally I abhor PvP because it is all about PK for the most part.  Two<br/>\n&gt; things they are doing will make a huge difference.  Like the Team PvP<br/>\n&gt; servers, only races openly at war can PvP one another without consequence.<br/>\n&gt; The big difference is, there will not be a way to tell the difference<br/>\n&gt; between PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s on sight.  If you see an Orc on the road ahead and<br/>\n&gt; you are an elf, you know that he is dangerous to you, whether he is a player<br/>\n&gt; or an npc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Their consequence system is brutal against PK&#39;ers.  If you kill a race that<br/>\n&gt; you are not at war with, even a mere 5 or 6 times you will suffer enormous<br/>\n&gt; problems.  These problems will include having npc bounty-hunters showing up<br/>\n&gt; to kill you at random.  Playing a PK character would rapidly become<br/>\n&gt; unplayable as every time you logged in you were ambush by these npc<br/>\n&gt; enforcers.  Even if you kept your PK-ing to a race yours was at war with,<br/>\n&gt; you would always find yourself in enemy territory where few would feel any<br/>\n&gt; compunction against killing you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t really interested much in Horizons initailly due to it&#39;s PvP<br/>\n&gt; system, but they have convinced me to give it a chance.  They feel their PvP<br/>\n&gt; system will promote the &#39;risk game&#39; like Player competition while severely<br/>\n&gt; punishing to the point of oblivion anyone who PK&#39;s for the joy of hurting<br/>\n&gt; others.
