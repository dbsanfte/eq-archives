I&#39;m usually grouped with a lot of tanks.  In<br/>\nLGuk it&#39;s usually 2 or 3 paladins with ghoulbanes, a warrior<br/>\nwith an executioner&#39;s axe, and a ranger with various procing<br/>\nweapons.  Since I&#39;m usually doing crowd control or buffing<br/>\nresists, I&#39;m not using my weapons anyway, so (on the dead<br/>\nside) I usually use Chant of Battle (with drum) instead of<br/>\nCelerity.  Those weapons proc a lot more, usually 2-3 times a<br/>\nfight each (and a couple extra procs from ghoulbane pretty<br/>\nmuch equals the damage I could do with my weapons).  Of course<br/>\nif I can spare the song slot, I use both.  And on the live<br/>\nside I usually prefer Celerity and join in the fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
