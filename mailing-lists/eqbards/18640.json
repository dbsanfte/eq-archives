Found no oven or other<br/>\ncombining device like pottery wheels or kilns.  It could be that the<br/>\nnecessary items to forage for the cake are only available in that zone, or<br/>\nperhaps in the Temple of Droga.  I did not search the Temple of Droga for an<br/>\noven though.  I&#39;ll try and remember to do that tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nSineras, you say that you fear that you may have said too much which implies<br/>\nthat you know more.  What might you know that you&#39;re not telling us, pray<br/>\ntell?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n[51 Minstrel] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; \tThis is all what I figured about the quest when i first<br/>\n&gt; heard about it. So<br/>\n&gt; far as I gathered, there is no recipe. We apparently have to find one or<br/>\n&gt; rather forage one where burynai live.
