I wonder if someone could detail a play by play on how it might be best used against 3 or 4 creatures my group and myself might encounter.  I honestly haven&#39;t seen much effect when I have tried to use it....ok things nod but that doesn&#39;t seem to have any other effect.  Also it is an area effect right, so do I target a creature, myself, what?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help y&#39;all can give!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRyleth Stormsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
