On Nag I tend to get right under his tummy and punch<br/>\nhim in the junks for 10-15 or so.  This is by far the most fun I have in EQ<br/>\nand where I&#39;ve got my most treasured screenshot:  You punch Lord Nagafen<br/>\nfor 8 points.  You have slain Lord Nagafen.  You recieve party experience. <br/>\nWelcome to level 49!  In the loot window is my drum and orb. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nVox has a much larger melee range and we (my guild) tends to spread out a<br/>\nbit more in her lair, so I usually don&#39;t get to stand right under her and<br/>\nhave to move around quit a bit more.  I still melee with the ol&#39; wood elf<br/>\nfists of might!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mithril Vs Lambent:<br/>\nFashion is almost *everything* - the difference in stats is negliable in my<br/>\nopinion as long as you have a good group backing you up.  Mithril is pretty<br/>\nugly and can&#39;t be properly accorized, go in a full suit or don&#39;t go at all.<br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current Superman outfit is red dragon scale, rubi boots, elf hide<br/>\ngloves, 2 orbs with the rest lambent.  I&#39;m going to try for Wolverine now<br/>\nthat there is a pair of claws that can be wore in the off hand... what helm<br/>\nis black plate?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Singing Steel:<br/>\nThe effects are that bad, maybe its just how I play.  Having food and water<br/>\nis nice, enduring breath is great for exploring too.  The AC is ridiculous<br/>\nhowever.  Each peice could use a +2-3 point boost *minimum*.<br/>\n<br/>\nUberguilds:<br/>\nI hate the term but my guild (LoS, Legacy of Steel) gets accused of it too.<br/>\n We&#39;re small as things go, 50 real people but we can do anything in the<br/>\ngame at anytime and we always share our info, tactics and assistance once<br/>\nwe&#39;re confident its correct, so I tend to reject a lot of the critism that<br/>\nis leveled against us by a very small very vocal segment of the server.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Loot:<br/>\nWe NEVER random, we NEVER do multiguild events.  Our GM (or officer if he<br/>\nis not present) calls loot and that&#39;s that - we work so well together<br/>\nbecause we&#39;re like a family.  Who ever gets the drops we all consider it to<br/>\nhave been worth it, that&#39;s just how we are.  In the rare pick up groups I<br/>\njoin (rare because we almost always are doing some sort of event) I simply<br/>\nfore go loot because of all the difficulties and hard feelings that often<br/>\narise.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Weapons Vs Songs:<br/>\nIf we&#39;re in a situation that requires tactics and team work I almost always<br/>\nopt for weapons, since our DoTs complicate mes.  I also go with weapons in<br/>\na &quot;normal&quot; group.  Other than that I tend to use the chants if (1) large<br/>\ncaster population benifits from debuffs (2) solo&#39;ing or (3) I have a mage<br/>\n(and now rogue gaga! =D) about that I can harass for summoned daggers. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Kurnark Loot:<br/>\nI HATE it not being NODROP most of all, but also I HATE soloable yard trash<br/>\nat the zone line dropping stuff better than stuff my guild spend MONTHS<br/>\n/played in planes for and I HATE the Monty Haul stats.  I had a really long<br/>\nrant typed out but in the end I deleted because there&#39;s no need to subject<br/>\nyou all to it. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun all and sorry for the novel!<br/>\n-Tork@Nameless<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
