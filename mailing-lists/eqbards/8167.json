You&#39;re much better off using your<br/>\nDragoon Dirk in your primary and secondary wield a barbed whip.  Quite<br/>\nsimply, the Dragoon Dirk is a superior weapons.  If you can get some Thulian<br/>\nClaws or a Silvery War Axe, then I&#39;d move that to primary and the Dirk to<br/>\nsecondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, I just traded my Brazen Brass Kilij for Thulian Claws<br/>\nlastnight.  I didn&#39;t realize that they carried so much clout (the Kilij).<br/>\nDefinitely gonna have to get another one.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 28 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 8:37 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Stats and Jewelry<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I would consider is replacing at least one of your two barbed<br/>\nleather whips.  I used to dual wield a dragoon dirk and barbed leather whip.<br/>\nIn combats that lasted more than a minute, the barbed leather whip would<br/>\ncause a serious stamina drain.  I would venture to guess that dual wielding<br/>\ntwo of them is even more severe.  I now dual wield thulian claws (cost me<br/>\n400PP) and a dragoon dirk.  In groups, very rarely does my stamina drop<br/>\nbelow one bub anymore, even after long combats.  The only time it will drop<br/>\nbelow one bub is if I am soloing a blue that takes me forever to kill.<br/>\nObviously you can avoid the stamina drain by singing the Jig but you could<br/>\nfree up that song slot and memorize a different song by equipping some<br/>\nweapons lighter than the barbed leather whips.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Neflyte &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Daniel.Grenon@...\">Daniel.Grenon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, I manage to accumulate some pp and now is the time to buy<br/>\n&gt; stuff. ;-) I have my Level 20 song and I now want to optimize my<br/>\n&gt; stats and stuff a little bit. I was to do exactly what is in this<br/>\n&gt; message<br/>\n&gt; then I decided that sharing this and asking for advice (or approval)<br/>\n&gt; would not hurt since we are talking several 100pp for the jewelry<br/>\n&gt; and equipment. If you need to know<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I use 2 Barbed Leather Whips (delay 28 damage 7) and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; the Dragoon Dirk.
