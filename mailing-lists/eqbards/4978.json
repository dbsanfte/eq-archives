My friends and I had<br/>\nbeen fighting orcs in Highpass, and the majority of them were<br/>\nconning green to me at 19.  Then came a patch and the majority<br/>\nwere blue again.  A couple weeks ago someone on this list<br/>\nnoted that it had happened again, and the Highpass orcs now<br/>\ngive you experience up into your low 20s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine they&#39;re tweaking the level spreads in different<br/>\nareas to give folks more things to fight, but I wish they&#39;d<br/>\nannounce these things.  It can be a major pain to attack<br/>\nsomething you&#39;d been killing easily last night, and die to it<br/>\ntonight; especially once you hit level 25 and the /con<br/>\nmessages are the same for all blues - you cannot tell a low<br/>\nblue from a high blue.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
