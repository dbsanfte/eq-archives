Don&#39;t you take<br/>\n  action?  Aren&#39;t you the slightest bit pissed off?  This isn&#39;t some mud<br/>\n  you log into everyday and play around for free.  This is a service that<br/>\n  a company is offering to us.  If your power company ups your rate,<br/>\n  what do you do?  Call them and tell them to cancel your power, cause<br/>\n  you are pissed off?  F no, you don&#39;t do that.  You complain like a <br/>\n  mofo and make people aware that it&#39;s unfair.  Verant offers a very<br/>\n  attractive service, one which I want to be a part of.  That&#39;s right,<br/>\n  I want to play these game with my friends, in fact I pay to play this<br/>\n  game with my friends, and that gives me every right to complain about<br/>\n  the company until they get it right.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Verant is making poor decisions, and they have zero, that&#39;s right,<br/>\n  zero coordination and testing going on right now.  That much is<br/>\n  evident and clear to me.  What really f&#39;ing pisses me off, is that<br/>\n  those stupid GMs sat their lazy asses on the Plane of Sky for 2 or<br/>\n  3 months, when they could have been testing it out.  Now look at<br/>\n  the Plane of Sky, it&#39;s totally busted... The quests dont work, the<br/>\n  text in the quests is wrong.  This isn&#39;t unusual, and if you expect<br/>\n  us to say they are only human, give them a break everytime they <br/>\n  change one thing in this game and it causes a failure, then when are<br/>\n  they gonna do something correctly?  Should I give them an A for <br/>\n  effort, when they are failing to produce any measurable results?<br/>\n  Did you get an A for effort in school, because you tried hard<br/>\n  and had your heart in it?  I doubt it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I will be the first to congrat Verant on a job well done.  The fact<br/>\n  of the matter is, they aren&#39;t doing a good job.  They aren&#39;t even<br/>\n  doing a decent job.  They are just bumbling along, until the day<br/>\n  that this all crumbles down in a heap of confusion.  If you think <br/>\n  that frustrating players is doing a good job, then they are doing<br/>\n  terrific at that.  I liked the patch message, I have no complaints<br/>\n  about the bard additions.  But I&#39;m tired of them not addressing the<br/>\n  real issues at hand, in order to make non-critical adjustments to<br/>\n  the game.  The fact that two continents were missing should have<br/>\n  clued anyone in to the future of this game.  This game is and will<br/>\n  always be incomplete until they address some very big player based<br/>\n  problems, including graphic effects, and bugs that have existed <br/>\n  since beta.  Verant as a whole _is_ lazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I want to help Verant, I have ideas, I have time to test, I even have<br/>\n  the patience to live through their mistakes.  But every g&#39;damn time<br/>\n  I log into the game, I&#39;m riddled by bugs, by crashes, by problems.<br/>\n  It&#39;s amazing that it even still works, although they will claim it&#39;s<br/>\n  never been broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah, I could grow up a little, and lay off the cursing, lay off the<br/>\n  Flame Verant bandwagon, but they&#39;ve lost their players admiration in<br/>\n  this &#39;vision&#39; they have.  If they want to keep screwing around with<br/>\n  things because it fits their ideas of the game they want without<br/>\n  considering what the players are looking for in their game, they <br/>\n  are bound for a rude awakening.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
