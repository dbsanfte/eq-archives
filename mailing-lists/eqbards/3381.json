In-game<br/>\n&gt;reasoning does have importance and must be considered, but since we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;creating an artificial world out-of-game constraints must take precedence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If there is any chance of persuading Verant to open the bard class to dark<br/>\n&gt;elves, the argument must be based on game balance.  Once you have a<br/>\n&gt;persuasive position there, inventing the in-game explanations for the way<br/>\n&gt;things are is easy and fun and somewhat unnecessary, since people will do<br/>\n&gt;it themselves even if you supply canned explanations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The biggest problem with accomplishing your goal is prying information out<br/>\n&gt;of Verant.  They may have the killer out-of-game argument for the way<br/>\n&gt;things are or they may not have thought very deeply about it.  Making that<br/>\n&gt;sort of determination in the face of Verant&#39;s general lack of communication<br/>\n&gt;will be somewhere between difficult and impossible unless you can find the<br/>\n&gt;right nerve to hit and actually get a response as we do from J.M. on some<br/>\n&gt;topics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Personally, I find attempts to communicate with Verant extremely<br/>\n&gt;frustrating.  For the most part people there, including J.M., don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt;acknowledge most questions or suggestions, so you have no clue when they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;even listening, much less what light they may be able to shed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tBob </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
