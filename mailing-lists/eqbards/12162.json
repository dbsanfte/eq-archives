Can anyone tell me what level Greater Ice bones are, I was in the<br/>\n&gt; bedroom in L Guk with my group and we had cleared the area. I went round<br/>\n&gt; the corner towards the Assasin room and there were 3 Gtr Ice bones, all<br/>\n&gt; conned red to me at level 30 so I didn&#39;t risk pulling them.

You made the right choice to leave them be.  They&#39;re probably about<br/>\nlevel 34-36 as they were blue to me at 37th.  They&#39;re nasty for their level<br/>\nthough: casting tanks slinging cold based spells.  When you pull one you get<br/>\nthem all, so you would have been fighting five spell casting tanks with your<br/>\ngroup.  It woulda been ugly.<br/>\n------<br/>\nFYI:<br/>\nThreading your way from the zone to the more difficult parts of lower guk is<br/>\ntricky.  For those that don&#39;t know lower guk, you zone in and there&#39;s some<br/>\nundead frogs (and some live ones) near the dead side zone, but if you want<br/>\nto go to any of the places in lower guk with named mobs you have to get an<br/>\ninvis vs undead and swim down a little stream, under a stone overhang, and<br/>\npop up into the &quot;Bedroom&quot; (or BR, so-called because there&#39;s a bed in it).<br/>\nThere&#39;s about three spawn locations in the bedroom, and undead ghoul wizards<br/>\nare fequently here.  Taking the room can be kinda tricky for people of the<br/>\nappropriate level to fight there, but for folks in their lower 30s it&#39;s<br/>\nabout the best place to be *except* for the fact that any time you hear<br/>\n&quot;DEAD TRAIN!&quot; or &quot;GIBS TRAIN&quot;, it&#39;s coming right through there unless the<br/>\nconductor dies.  No ifs, ands, buts or saving rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two paths leading out of the BR and they both very shortly empty<br/>\ninto the same room.  This room, the &quot;bat room&quot;, has a passage leading off to<br/>\nthe left and to the right.  Most people are heading left as that takes you<br/>\nover toward the assassin, etc. and most of lower guk.  The bat room room has<br/>\na couple of frog spawns and some sonic bats.  Here&#39;s the tricky part.  The<br/>\ninvis vs undead that you got at the zone doesn&#39;t help you with the bats,<br/>\nonly the frogs, however, if you hug the wall going left pretty tightly then<br/>\nthe bats won&#39;t agro on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now you&#39;re in a hallway leading further into the dead side of lower guk<br/>\nand you&#39;ve made it past some undead frogs and the live bats and you&#39;re<br/>\nfeeling pretty good.  Ahead of you you see 5 great big Greater Ice Bones in<br/>\na little alcove to your left.  What you don&#39;t know the first time or two<br/>\nthat you go there is that your invis vs undead doesn&#39;t work against them.<br/>\nMost folks just jog down the hall and die horrible screaming deaths their<br/>\nfirst time and think that their invis dropped.  To get by the GIBS you have<br/>\nto hug the right wall like your life depends on it, &#39;cause it does.  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re not rubbing the righthand wall opposite the GIBS when you pass by<br/>\nhere there is an extremely good chance that they will agro on you.  Those<br/>\nsuckers killed me about three times in earlier levels because I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n*quite* rubbing the wall.  Once I accidentally got my finger across two keys<br/>\non the keyboard and was dead about 15 seconds later.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally speaking, once you&#39;re past those GIBS your worst fear is that your<br/>\ninvis vs undead will drop - and it will at the worst possible times.<br/>\nSometimes it seems like the chances of invis vs undead failing is directly<br/>\nproportional to how badly you need it.  Get invis vs undead and sit at the<br/>\nzone and it&#39;ll last 20 minutes.  Get invis vs undead and head way off to the<br/>\nExecutioner&#39;s Room or something and it&#39;ll fail when you pop up into the<br/>\nbedroom.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
