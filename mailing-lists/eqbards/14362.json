I didn&#39;t notice that yours was a<br/>\npersonal email.  I stand corrected on your behavior on this list.  It<br/>\nremains of a high standard.  You are a good role model ).<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, Steelwolf, shame on you for posting a personal email to a public<br/>\nmailing list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrignal<br/>\npost------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--------------<br/>\nOk, you two, am I gonna have to call your father in here with his belt? jk<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s all calm down a bit shall we.  Steelwolf, you are entitled to your<br/>\nopinion and so is Harmonic.  There is no need for this cursing and flaming<br/>\ngoing on from either of you.  In Harm&#39;s original post, his subject line even<br/>\nsaid it was a rant and off topic.  In the text prior to his rant he said, if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t want to read it, just delete it.  That should be good enough for<br/>\nall of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Harmonic, I understand that it is very hard to get personal attacks from<br/>\npeople, but it does no good to join in and start bashing as well.  It just<br/>\nperpetuates the cycle and everyone gets to look bad.  I honestly expect a<br/>\nlittle more from you.  You ( as well as some of the other prolific posters)<br/>\nare like the big brothers of the board.  The rest of us take our cue from<br/>\nyou on how to act.  If you start bringing it down to this level, the list is<br/>\ngonna degrade pretty fast.  That said, I really admire your contribution to<br/>\nthe list.  I hope I too can contribute when I am more accomplished as a<br/>\nbard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the rest of you, let&#39;s act like the adults I know most of you are and<br/>\nlet people have their say without condemning them and flaming them.  If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like it, give your own opinion without making it a personal attack.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just your opinion after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlyrean Daoine&#39;Sidhe, Bard of the 20th Song on E&#39;ci<br/>\n(Can you tell I am a Mom, in RL?)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
