It is<br/>\n&gt; called &quot;Evade&quot;. This skill has the effect of lowering the amount that the<br/>\n&gt; targeted NPC hates the rogue, and has the potential of making the engaged<br/>\n&gt; NPC switch to another target (preferably a tank) within the rogue&#39;s group.<br/>\n&gt; It is essentially a &quot;reverse taunt&quot;. This ability helps mitigate the<br/>\n&gt; negative effects of the rogue&#39;s exceedingly high damage-output potential.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; also will in-turn help the rogue do even more damage as the NPC is much<br/>\n </span></blockquote>more<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; likely to expose its back.
