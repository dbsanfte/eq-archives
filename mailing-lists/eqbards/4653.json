","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-96690048\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let me guess - you were just singing the Rhythm songs, right?<br/>\n&gt;Try playing them with a drum.  Up til about level 17 I&#39;d say<br/>\n&gt;their use is minor.  At 17 you get Guardian Rhythms which<br/>\n&gt;stacks with the other two Rhythm songs (those two don&#39;t stack<br/>\n&gt;with each other).  With a drum and playing Guardian and<br/>\n&gt;Elemental Rhythms, you should be able to get your party&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;magic resist up over 75.  If a caster buffs everyone with<br/>\n&gt;Endure Magic, that should be close to 100.  *Nobody* can raise<br/>\n&gt;magic resist like a bard can.  As far as I know, the best<br/>\n&gt;Endure Magic spell only increases it by 30 points.  At level<br/>\n&gt;29 with a battle drum, I can raise it by close to 80 points.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
