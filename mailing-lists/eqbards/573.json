Although the task is<br/>\nsometimes time consuming and heck even irritating at times, doing this<br/>\ntask for free can have it&#39;s own benefits.  Usually I get a decent sized<br/>\ndonation from the person I help.  Many times I do not.  THough it is<br/>\nfrustrating that I do not get compensation there are still some benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, helping people is a great way to meet people.  I have made a<br/>\ngood number of friends doing this.  Heck one even made the trouble of<br/>\nfinding to give a thank you gift.  I wasn&#39;t to complain when she gave me a<br/>\nbanded belt. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, you never know when this person will in turn help you.  I helped<br/>\na cleric to find her corpse somewhere around orc camp.  She thanked me<br/>\nprofusely and offered payment which I refused.  Around two weeks later<br/>\nsomeone started a train in CB(like that isn&#39;t a new occurance) and I was<br/>\nbarely able to get awy.  To me that was surprising since the whole castle<br/>\nwas bearing down on me.  In the end I found out that the cleric had<br/>\nstarted a bard character and upon seeing me return my kindness by<br/>\nsacrificing herslef to save me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this is not an occurance that you will see on a regular basis, but<br/>\nthese are somethings to consider when you announe that you are charging<br/>\nfor services.  People are less likely to be friendly to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbraham Hardjana<br/>\nTreilanin - Karana - Bard of the 16th Order</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
