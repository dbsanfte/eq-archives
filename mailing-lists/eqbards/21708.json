She was 14 *seasons* old.  Now in a normal world, this could mean <br/>\nanything from 3 and a half (4 seasons a year!), to  a whole lot older.  I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s safe to assume from the generalized descriptions that the <br/>\ncharacter is not 3 and a half, but to assume that it&#39;s the story of the <br/>\nrape of a minor is reading a whole lot into the story.  Fact is, it tells <br/>\nme a whole lot about how the &quot;higher ups&quot; think - as Freud said, sometimes <br/>\nthe cigar IS just a cigar!  14 seasons could mean 14th level - and judging <br/>\nby the effectiveness of the poison she used, I&#39;d have to say she was at <br/>\nleast that!<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Double standards, Verant.  Or does GM Zatosia have special permission to <br/>\nbe particularly gruesome?  Frankly, if I were you, I&#39;d be sending that GM <br/>\nin for some counseling, or be worried about another Columbine in your own <br/>\noffices.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Intellectual property: If you truly want to force the issue, Wizards of <br/>\nthe Coast would be more than happy to discuss the issue of intellectual <br/>\nproperties with you.  Names are not the only thing that can be considered <br/>\nintellectual property, and frankly, you&#39;ve stolen a LOT from WOTC <br/>\nproperties.  Also, prosecuting ONE instance, while ignoring or encouraging <br/>\nliterally thousands of others is discrimination in the most basic <br/>\nsense.  You are choosing who to prosecute, and only applying the rules <br/>\nwhere it suits you. This is not fair to anyone concerned.  If you are going <br/>\nto ban someone for use of &quot;copyrighted materials&quot;, then you need to jump on <br/>\na lot of cases - not just this one that happens to offend your sensibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Derivative work: You are ENTIRELY off-base calling those stories <br/>\n&quot;derivative works.&quot;  Who is your lawyer?
