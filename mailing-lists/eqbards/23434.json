If you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; pulling, you&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; taking faction hits.  There really isn&#39;t any way around it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You will rarely be getting single mobs.  Half of the mobs are <br/>\n&gt; unmezable.<br/>\n&gt; If it takes your entire force over 30 seconds to kill a single normal<br/>\n&gt; mob...thats, um, bad.  I&#39;m not an enchanter, but mem blur <br/>\n&gt; appears to take<br/>\n&gt; several casts, and they never seem to know if it worked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PoG can be pretty fun.   If you want to be a puller, good for <br/>\n&gt; you.   But<br/>\n&gt; realistically, don&#39;t expect to do it without faction consequences.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; regards,<br/>\n&gt; Suladan Starfinder<br/>\n&gt; The Pantheon<br/>\n&gt; 58 bard, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 23 Jan 2001 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Was wondering if there is any way for a bard to serve as <br/>\n&gt; main puller in PoG<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without taking a negative Tunare faction hit? From what I <br/>\n&gt; have read, a lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of folks are using non-KOS players to serve as scouts in <br/>\n&gt; PoG in order to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lead the puller to the next mob. If there was some way for <br/>\n&gt; us to remain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non-KOS while pulling, think this could be a lot of fun <br/>\n&gt; since we could both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scout and pull.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was thinking that one possibility is for an enchanter to <br/>\n&gt; cast mem blur on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the mob as you pulled it back to the camp. Another option <br/>\n&gt; would be for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bard to camp as soon as he dropped the mob off at the camp. <br/>\n&gt; This would work<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assuming you can camp out before the raid members killed <br/>\n&gt; the mob. Anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know if these two options will work? Any other options?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In every major raid I have attended, I almost always end up <br/>\n&gt; playing mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; battery or resist buffer. This is all fine and dandy, but <br/>\n&gt; getting to be main<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scout/puller for a major raid sounds like it would be a lot of fun.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
