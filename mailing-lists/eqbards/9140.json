This was the first time I had ever grouped with anyone where<br/>\n&gt; the level differential (9 levels between highest to lowest) was that high<br/>\n&gt; and I still got experience.  Everything we were fighting conned red to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A level 31 friend reported getting experience grouped with a<br/>\n45, but not a 46.  My guess is it caps out at a 16 level<br/>\ndelta. That is, a level 35 player grouped with a level 50<br/>\nwould get exp, but a level 34 would not.  At the low end, a<br/>\nlevel 1 player will not get experience with a level 5 (4 level<br/>\ndelta).  Everything else in the middle is a gradual scale<br/>\nbetween these two deltas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Given the situation I just described, and over the same amount of time,<br/>\n&gt; would the total experience received in both situations come close to being<br/>\n&gt; equal?  In other words, does grouping with higher level characters fighting<br/>\n&gt; mobs that con red to you equal (or come close to equalling) grouping with<br/>\n&gt; equal level characters fighting mobs that con blue to you?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The way JM described it, the fraction of the experience for a<br/>\nkill that you get is:<br/>\n<br/>\n your total experience<br/>\n------------------------<br/>\nparty&#39;s total experience<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you should get good experience provided you kill things<br/>\nthat are reasonably difficult for the average level of the<br/>\nparty.  If you kill stuff blue to the lowest level person,<br/>\nit&#39;ll be very slow.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
