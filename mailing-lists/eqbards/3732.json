Ok, that&#39;s well and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;good then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You got some poor advice.  There is no magical road to money in trade<br/>\n&gt; skills.  There are a few trade skills where you can make a profit, but<br/>\n&gt; normally require hundreds of plat and many hours to build up your skill<br/>\n&gt; level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [trade skill failures clipped]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Forget trade skills.  You are never going to get rich there.  You need to<br/>\n&gt; kill mobs with decent loot.  The two legged mobs almost always have better<br/>\n&gt; loot than the four legged ones.  Two great areas for your level are<br/>\n&gt; Blackburrow and Crushbone.  Since you are in Freeport, you might not want<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; travel that far.  Instead there is Befallen and all the Derv camps in WC,<br/>\n&gt; North and South Ro.  You will get rusty weapons, and pieces of armor,<br/>\n&gt; sometimes even a bronze weapon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Collect every single thing from the corpses to sell.  You may want to<br/>\ninvest<br/>\n&gt; in some backpacks.  Once you are way overloaded, sell everything.  It is<br/>\n&gt; important to find a merchant that will give you a good price.  With Selos,<br/>\n&gt; you can run a bit farther for better prices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After an hour or so, you will will have your bp&#39;s full of junk.  It will<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; sell for about 1-3gp.  But if you have 20 items, that can come out to<br/>\n3-6pp.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes you will get lucky and find a bronze weapon that sells for<br/>\n1-3pp.<br/>\n&gt; Play for 3-4 hours and you can earn near 20pp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Frankly, it looks like Verant wants lower level folks to be dependent on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;handouts from higher level folks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How can you possibly believe that?  My bard never got a handout.  At level<br/>\n&gt; 13 I have full banded, a Combine LS, and 10pp in the bank.  For all of us<br/>\n&gt; who started from day one, we had no one to give us handouts.  Don&#39;t insult<br/>\n&gt; us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I find it rather sad that I can barely<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get necessities on my own each level up to level 10 and now that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level 11, I really need banded to survive and I can&#39;t afford it, nor does<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it look like I will ever afford it soon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I assume that you did waste some of your money learning all the trade<br/>\n&gt; skills.  That is a hole you will have to work out of.  But with hard work,<br/>\n&gt; you can overcome this.  Just concentrate on getting one piece of banded at<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
