I find a hill <br/>\ngiant roaming around and for kicks charm him and he&#39;s killing spiders for <br/>\nme. After all the spiders are clear, I bring him over to kill Broon. Nobody <br/>\nelse has been hunting him and there&#39;s few people in the zone anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy pet kills Broon, then Droon pretty easily. I decide I&#39;m bored with the <br/>\nhill giant and start Dot&#39;ing him to death, when I spy an evil eye through <br/>\nthe rain. I can also make out a shield by the EE, so I figure he must have <br/>\nsummoned a pet as well. My pet still has about 1.5 bubbles, so I charm him <br/>\nand send him in to kill the EE. I&#39;ve been killed by EE&#39;s in the past, so <br/>\nI&#39;m thinking revenge<br/>\n<br/>\nI swoop by just to make sure nobody is fighting him, and I think I see a <br/>\nplayer there, but it turns out to be an NPC as I target him when I click my <br/>\n&quot;target nearest NPC&quot;. Never heard of this NPC in the zone, but he&#39;s green <br/>\nto me, so no worries. I&#39;ll just kill the EE.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy giant goes in and stomps the eye to death. I recharm him and he goes <br/>\nrunning back through the fog to finish off the EE&#39;s pet, I&#39;m sure. <br/>\nAfterwards, I DOT the HG to death and go in to check out the corpses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s the corpse of an evil eye, and there&#39;s the corpse of the npc, but <br/>\nit has a guild tag after the name. ACK! I do a quick &quot;/who all&quot; and send a <br/>\ntell to the player, &quot;I&#39;m sooo sorry!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s saying, &quot;Oh no problem, the evil eye had me charmed and had me fight a <br/>\nhill giant.&quot; I sadly explain that the hill giant was my pet and I had sent <br/>\nhim in to kill the Evil Eye. To his credit, he was very cordial and told me <br/>\nnot to worry about it. He turns out to be a level 18 bard who accidentally <br/>\nran into the Eye. Ack! I killed a fellow minstrel!<br/>\n<br/>\nI offered him the lambent stone that dropped on the hill giant and also <br/>\ngave him a lumberjack cap that I still had in my bags and though he said I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to do that, I&#39;m glad he finally accepted them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know to check a little closer to any pets an evil eye may have. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
