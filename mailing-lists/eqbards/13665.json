As Brad has<br/>\n&gt; direct access to the customer database, I think this provides a perfect<br/>\n&gt; example of the uselessness of web polls. The only thing that poll tells<br/>\n&gt; you is that 6% of the people who go to everlore and bothered to take the<br/>\n&gt; poll (and only voted once) have a 45+ character. I hope you can<br/>\n&gt; understand the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bear in mind that what you as a player see in the game is<br/>\ngoing to be inaccurate too.  When you take a random sample of<br/>\nplayers you see in the game, there are two biases:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Your level.  If you&#39;re high level, you&#39;re spending more<br/>\ntime in high level zones, and thus see mostly high level<br/>\npeople.  If you&#39;re low level, you&#39;re spending more time in low<br/>\nlevel zones, and thus see mostly low level people.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  High level.  How do you get to high level?  By spending<br/>\nlots of time playing the game.  So whereas ten L20 players<br/>\nmight play a cumulative 40 hours a week, a single L50 player<br/>\nmight play 40 hours a week.  The result is that you see this<br/>\nL50 player online as often as you see the ten L20 players.  <br/>\nOr put another way, your perception is that there are as many<br/>\nL50 players as there are L20 players - for every single L20<br/>\nplayer you see, there is a L50 player online - when in fact<br/>\nthere are really 10 times as many L20 players.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t think there are that many high level players<br/>\n(L45+) in the game.  They just have a greater presence because<br/>\nthey put more hours into the game.  If we were paying for the<br/>\ngame by the hour, then they&#39;d have clout proportional to their<br/>\nplaytime.  But we&#39;re all paying a flat fee.  I really hope<br/>\nVerant knows what side their bread is buttered on.  (And FWIW,<br/>\nmy main character is L45.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
