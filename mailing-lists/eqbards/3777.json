First<br/>\nyou scribe the song to your spell book. You only have to do this one time.<br/>\nTo use a song, you need to memorize it so that it appears on the left side<br/>\nof your screen as an icon you can click on.  You have to do this each time<br/>\nyou die and need to re-learn your songs.  So don&#39;t die!  When you have it<br/>\nscribes and memorized you can click on it and you will be &#39;singing&#39; that<br/>\nsong and the power that it gives you will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelos Accellarando will make you feet move faster.  You will be able to run<br/>\nreally fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther songs have other powers, like better ability to fight, able to heal up<br/>\nfaster and other specail powers - read the manual and try things. Also go to<br/>\nthe great bard web sites and read up.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wwwharpers.net/bard\">http://wwwharpers.net/bard</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wwwharpers.com/bard\">http://wwwharpers.com/bard</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nBards powers will affect everyone in their party.  Some bard songs are<br/>\nenhanced if you play an instrument while you sing.  The first instrument to<br/>\nget is a drum.  Sing Selos song & play (remove your weapons and put the drum<br/>\nin your 2nd melee slot) and you will run faster than anyone else - including<br/>\nthe monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt your age - you should use chant of battle when fighting and hymn of<br/>\nrestoration for healing.  And next level 5 you can get Selos for running and<br/>\ntraveling. The level 2 song - chords is harder to use and you will find that<br/>\nif you use it near guards they don&#39;t like it in a big way! (They will think<br/>\nyou are attacking them and attack you back.) So if you don&#39;t have Chords of<br/>\nDissonance - don&#39;t worry - you can buy it later on when you know how to use<br/>\nit better.  But buy the Lyssa Locating song (4) for finding corpses and the<br/>\nHymn of Restoration (6) for healing and Selos (3) for running.  The chords<br/>\n(2) and Jig (3) you can get later when you feel you really need them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 15th level<br/>\na.k.a.
