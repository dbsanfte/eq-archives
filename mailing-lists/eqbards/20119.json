Enchanters are awesome alongside<br/>\nbards.  Sure you can&#39;t use your &quot;Standard&quot; songs but working around an<br/>\nenchanter&#39;s strengths, and enhancing them in some cases, is a good thing.  I<br/>\nfind it fun and enjoyable.  Enchanters love having me with them and vice<br/>\nversa.  I really don&#39;t think there&#39;s any &quot;personality type&quot; that&#39;s<br/>\nincompatible with bards. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nYer a bard, be versatile.  Thats one of OUR strengths.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
