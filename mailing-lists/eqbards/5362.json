Also available are charred gloves n boots in the same dungeon<br/>\noff the captain kobold spawn near the fireplace room (boots common drop<br/>\ngloves rare). Be aware you will get BAD faction hits with gnomes if you go<br/>\nfor the BP. Also need to melee the clockwork. I was lucky..we weren&#39;t<br/>\ncamping it on purpose..not for a BP..we were after a shield for a druid. Not<br/>\nsure if theres more pieces out there..if i get any will post.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
