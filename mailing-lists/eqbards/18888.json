A GM","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-614495386\">Heh - have not heard anything about HS on our server.  One of our bards<br/>\npicked his way in (before they changed that) and was greeted by the zone<br/>\nmobs.  A GM summoned him out because he was not supposed to be able to get<br/>\nin.  Suladan can elaborate &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile.....<br/>\n<br/>\nOld Sebilis is a high level dungeon that requires a key to get in.  To get<br/>\nthe key you need to camp 2 different blue to 51 froogs that are pretty darn<br/>\nmean.  Also, they trigger spawn the named mobs for the zone. And you need to<br/>\nkill the names to get more of the Forager and Hunter Froogs to spawn.  Then<br/>\nyou take these no drop lore items to a npc in a cave behind some specs and<br/>\nhe makes a key for you.  I have 2 keys.  Carry one and one in bank (where I<br/>\nam binded in FV).  Also its a one-way zone in.  The teleporter out is some<br/>\ndozen or so mobs away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe zone into Seb is benign (unless train by the zone in campers) and you<br/>\ncan ease you way in.  A simple 2 blues to pull (or lament one).  Then 4<br/>\nmore. Then a group of 3.  Then the bridge area and possible patrollers who<br/>\nare even or higher cons ro 51.  Then the fun begins.  On the top floor, you<br/>\ncan clear to the zone out and camp off there for exp (also zone in is camped<br/>\nfor exp).  Then there are 3 ways you can go deeper (and stay on the top<br/>\nfloor): to the Chef, the Emperor or the Commander (and the Pickler).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to see the chef one night and had 3 to 4 groups.  We were doing fine<br/>\nand set up for the Chef.  Stuff happened and 18 ppl died.  The six who lived<br/>\nand those who had 2nd keys went back in.  They died trying to clear back to<br/>\nwhere we were. Now we have 24 nekkid ppl who need keys to get back in.  Heh,<br/>\nwe camped the Froager and Hunter and got keys for everyone, went back in and<br/>\nsummoned corpses.<br/>\n<br/>\nSix hours of CR. Some folks had to eat exp on 2 deaths, everyone ate exp on<br/>\nat least one death.  Alot of folks are not going to like these keyed<br/>\ndungeons - a bunch already dont like them.  On the other hand, I have been<br/>\nin all of the top floor now - sometimes with only 1 group of 6 - sometimes<br/>\nwith only 2.  Evac plays an important role - very important.  You can evac<br/>\nout to the Emerald Jungle and run back to TT and Old Seb easily.
