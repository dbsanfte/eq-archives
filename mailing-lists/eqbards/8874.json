I used it to <br/>\npull them by stunning them first, and I run back to my safe spot invis and <br/>\nwait for it to come.  I also used it to interrupt his spells.  I also used <br/>\nit at Lower Guk a few days ago (Friday night I think) against Zol and Dar <br/>\nghoul frogloks, it works well.  I can hold them for like minutes so our <br/>\ngroup could break up the camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I think they Up&#39;ed the mob resist rate.  Not the resist messages, <br/>\nbut the way that they break the trance even when the song went thru.  I am <br/>\nat lv50 so maybe at lower level this will be worst.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Try it on yourself.
