If that&#39;s too<br/>\n&gt; &#39;unrealistic&#39; for them, why not do the following:<br/>\n&gt; /trust allows someone else to drag and loot your corpse.<br/>\n&gt; /consent allows someone to drag and loot your corpse without suffering<br/>\n&gt; penalties<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Something interesting I have to add - while visiting paineel, the new<br/>\nhome of my erudite necro, I tried to help an enchantress to get her<br/>\ncorpse back from the city (deathtrap :).<br/>\nThe strange thing was that she gave me consent but when I tried to drag<br/>\nI got &quot;You dont have consent to summon the corpse&quot; (!).
