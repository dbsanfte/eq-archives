Then I wield my mandolin and lament 3 beasts.  Rather than<br/>\n&gt; bellowing (bellowing takes too long, first lament will wear off), I run up<br/>\n&gt; to the fourth and wack him with my fists, turn and run.  While the creature<br/>\n&gt; gives chase I can easily pick up my shield and place it on the mandolin in<br/>\n&gt; my quickey slot, then put the madolin on my weapon and take it over to wield<br/>\n&gt; it.  By this time I can then turn around and begin fighting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Realize that you should press F1 to target yourself, and go ahead and try<br/>\n&gt; out a lament on yourself.  Now you can see just how long one of your own<br/>\n&gt; laments will last.  Try it with just voice and a stringed instrument.  Voice<br/>\n&gt; lament doesn&#39;t last long at all, but is probably best if you only need to<br/>\n&gt; use on one creature.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Roop<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
