It never lasted for 3 seconds as<br/>\nwould be the case if they were getting a chance to break out every round.<br/>\nSince these mobs all had Speed Factors of 30 it was really easy to see.  I&#39;d<br/>\nlullaby, mobs would nod.  Some nodded mobs would attack immediately,<br/>\nsometimes in the middle of propagating the nods messages.  No mobs that did<br/>\nnot attack immediately would attack thruout that entire pulse.  The nodded<br/>\nmobs that attacked the first time would attack again.  The nod messages<br/>\nwould propagate again followed by attacks from some of the nodded mobs<br/>\nimmediately thereafter.  Often different nodded mobs, no apparent pattern of<br/>\nonce it sticks you are good, mobs that didn&#39;t false nod for 10 pulses would<br/>\noften false nod for 2 in a row thereafter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
