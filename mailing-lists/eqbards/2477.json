Dexterity or agility? I hear dexterity is important<br/>\n&gt; for playing songs. How large an effect does this have? Does it actually<br/>\n&gt; increase the effectiveness of the song or does it just decrease how<br/>\n&gt; frequently you miss a note?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dexterity AND Charisma determine how much mana you have. Only one song at the<br/>\nmoment uses mana, so this isnt actually such a big deal. If I had to choose<br/>\nbetween Agi and Dex, I&#39;d choose Dex. Dexterity supposedly factors in how well<br/>\nyou hit. Agility factors in how well you avoid being hit. Usually in a group,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have a tank. Trust me, bards cant tank at higher levels. However, you<br/>\nwill be swinging your weapon, while someone else is taking the damage. So<br/>\nit&#39;d be more beneficial if you missed less often, than if you had higher Agi<br/>\nfor those times you find yourself tanking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Lastly, for any mid to high level bards out there wearing mostly<br/>\n&gt; steelplate, how much strength do you recommend? I don&#39;t want to be in a<br/>\n&gt; constant war against weight. I&#39;m thinking 100 strength to be safe, but I<br/>\n&gt; was thinking less might do (and allow me to put more into dexterity and<br/>\n&gt; agility).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have full plate. A mixture of some rubicite, and store-bought steel and<br/>\nother miscellaneous magic items. My weight with weapons (light weight<br/>\nweapons, mind you), food, and instruments comes to about 66. I&#39;d suggest you<br/>\nhave a base strength of 90 minimum and put extra points into charisma and<br/>\ndexterity. Later on, you&#39;ll get elf-hide gloves and a troll-hide belt.<br/>\nCombined, these items will raise str, sta, agi, and dex each by 5.<br/>\nAlso I try to get my strength up as much as possible. I have a bunch of +str<br/>\nitems which have raised it from my base of 85 to 116. I get extra dmg bonuses<br/>\nwhich is really cool, especially with Anthem playing during battle.<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
