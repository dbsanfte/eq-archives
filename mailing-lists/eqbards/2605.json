The song actually casts an aura of enchantment on<br/>\n&gt; yourself, attuned to a particular faction.  You choose a target to set<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; faction, and there&#39;s a glow on them as the magic touches them, but they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; apparently not enchanted in any way and don&#39;t react negatively.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The higher the price the more you save, into the many platinum of savings.<br/>\n&gt; It also helps to load up with as many charisma enhancing items as you can<br/>\n&gt; scrounge.  I now have a silk evening shirt and a cats-eye amulet as my<br/>\n&gt; shopping clothes and am watching out for appropriate earrings and other<br/>\n&gt; items.  They all make a difference that&#39;s real easy to test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thrush<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With more than 20 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ...ONElist is home to the liveliest discussions on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
