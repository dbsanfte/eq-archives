The general consensus<br/>\nwas that by the time you want to go to Lower Guk (A L30+<br/>\ndungeon), you&#39;ll be high enough level that the frogloks in<br/>\nUpper Guk will mostly leave you alone.  Also, there are two<br/>\nfactions of frogloks - the normal and the undead.  Killing<br/>\nundead frogloks raises your faction with the normal frogloks.  <br/>\nLower Guk is full of undead frogloks, so a few trips there<br/>\nshould get you back on the good side of the normal frogloks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I&#39;d say Misty Thicket and Butcherblock (minotaur<br/>\ncaves) are good for making money at L10.  In Innoluthe, Upper<br/>\nGuk, and Paw, you will have a big problem with trains -<br/>\nfrogloks and gnolls start to run away while at full speed<br/>\n(unlike orcs).  So they&#39;ll escape just as you&#39;re about to kill<br/>\nthem and come back with more mobs.  With frogloks, it&#39;s all<br/>\nthe water and the fact that they can swim faster than you<br/>\nwhich lets them get away. In Paw it&#39;s all the twists and<br/>\nturns.  Having someone who can root is essential for hunting<br/>\nin these places.  Blackburrow is not as bad in this respect<br/>\nbecause you can use Accelerando. But other classes can&#39;t, and<br/>\nthey&#39;ll start the trains for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
