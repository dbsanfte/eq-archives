The average roll is<br/>\nskewed towards the low end due to there being more low numbers<br/>\nthan winning numbers for groups &gt; 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, here&#39;s the answer:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe winning roll is the highest roll.  That means all the<br/>\nother rolls must be lower than it (duh!).  If, say, the<br/>\nwinning roll were 87, that would mean all the other rolls<br/>\nwould have to be below 87.  Well, the chance of a roll being<br/>\n86 or less is 86% (surprise! :).  So:<br/>\n<br/>\nN = number of people in the group <br/>\nW = odds of a non-winning roll (as a fraction, i.e. 86/100 = 0.86)<br/>\nW+1 = the winning roll<br/>\nP = chance of winning<br/>\n<br/>\nSince W is just the chance of another roll being less than<br/>\nyours, W^(N-1) is the chance of all other rolls in the group<br/>\nbeing less than yours.  Since the median is the 50% win mark,<br/>\nthe median winning roll will be a 50% chance of all other<br/>\nrolls being less than yours, or P = 0.5 (50%)<br/>\n<br/>\nP = 0.5 = W^(N-1) <br/>\n<br/>\nW = 0.5^[1/(N-1)], round up since we&#39;re really after W+1<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how it works out based on the number of people in your<br/>\ngroup:<br/>\n<br/>\nN  Winning roll <br/>\n2  51 <br/>\n3  71 <br/>\n4  80 <br/>\n5  85 <br/>\n6  88 <br/>\n10 94 <br/>\n20 97 <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you&#39;re in a group of 6 and the group gets a FBSS, and<br/>\nyou roll an 88, you have a 50/50 chance of winning the lotto.  <br/>\nLikewise, for a group of 6, here are the odds of you winning<br/>\nif you roll a certian number:<br/>\n<br/>\nRoll  Chance to win<br/>\n2      0.0000001%<br/>\n10     0.00059%<br/>\n20     0.025%<br/>\n30     0.21%<br/>\n40     0.90%<br/>\n50     2.82%<br/>\n60     7.15%<br/>\n70    15.64%<br/>\n80    30.77%<br/>\n85    41.82%<br/>\n88    49.84%<br/>\n90    55.84%<br/>\n92    62.40%<br/>\n95    73.39%<br/>\n98    85.87%<br/>\n100   95.10%<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems unfair that you need to roll an 88+ just to have a 50/50<br/>\nchance to win, eh?  Well, take comfort in knowing that<br/>\neveryone else in the group faces the same odds, and the chance<br/>\nof one of you winning is 100%.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
