(I hate<br/>\n  lower guk big time, it&#39;s like a grown up version of greater fay,<br/>\n  without any real &#39;growing up&#39;. hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tactician spawns, enchanter charms bok, sics bok on tactician.<br/>\n  Paladin and I go start beating on the tact, and I begin to chain<br/>\n  and chain and chain.  I must have sunk 20 chains on this frog,<br/>\n  then he turns on me.  Cleric went to bed, so the Shaman was the<br/>\n  healer.  This frog didn&#39;t miss me.  Every hit was 110+, and he<br/>\n  double attacked like that for about 5 rounds on me.  I backed<br/>\n  out and he was stuck on me like glue.  The shaman is yelling<br/>\n  LoM, the enchanter is spent, and this paladin cannot taunt<br/>\n  for poop.  The tactician was still half alive, and I was down<br/>\n  to 2 bubbles.  Our dmg output (paladin, bok, and myself) was<br/>\n  not going to kill this thing in time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is when the wheels start turning in your head.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  This is when your heart pushes blood to your brain.<br/>\n <br/>\n  Arendaline, bloodrush, your skin tingles, your heartrate skyrockets.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &#39;What do you do?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dance around the throne!! lol, go poor pathing!  I kept chaining <br/>\n  that frog and ran around the throne in the middle of the room over<br/>\n  and over, until the bok and paladin brought it to quarter life, and<br/>\n  then the shaman had enough mana to heal me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yet another weird, yet fun, night for me on EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Breaking the king room with 6 people, and holding it with 4 people<br/>\n  (minus any clerics or warriors for holding) was pretty intense and<br/>\n  very exciting.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
