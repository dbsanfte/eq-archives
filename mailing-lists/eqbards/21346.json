I have yet to see charm do anything<br/>\nbut aggro me to death in Skyfire for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - as far as people leaving - I think it has more to do with the way<br/>\nVerant has handled the issue than whether they are having fun without<br/>\nLullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they would come out and say &quot;Sorry, we have truly ignored you for 10<br/>\nmonths, and in looking at the issue now we see no reason to change it&quot;.  If<br/>\nthe original lullaby is over-powered now - it was over-powered now.  There<br/>\nwas nothing to test - there was no action to do - other making a decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find them less than honest, extremely arrogant, unwilling to admit<br/>\nmistakes and refusing to ever apologize (except in very weak way - Ester<br/>\nexcepted however).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have decided not to quit simply because of my friends in my guild and on<br/>\nmy server.  I have little to no respect for Verant in the regards of<br/>\ncustomer service and understanding the dynamic of the game they created.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I will continue to pay my $10/month - I will probably never buy<br/>\nanother game from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 11, 2000 12:21 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Wow...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m assuming you mean that egroups thing and paying stuff, heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nas to the verant &#39;&#39;changes&#39;&#39;, amazingly enough, i didn&#39;t notice any changes<br/>\nin how my bard played with respect to lullaby over the last 10 months or so.<br/>\nactually, my bard is much more powerful now than he was 10 moths ago.<br/>\nchants<br/>\nallow him to solo, higher charm allows him to crowd control mobs over 39 and<br/>\nsolo charm kiting to 50+.<br/>\n<br/>\nso there&#39;s no reason to quit for me, i am having as much or more fun playing<br/>\nmy bard<br/>\nas ever.  did crowd control with charm in karnors last night, kept 4 mobs<br/>\nbusy<br/>\n(charmed a skeletal warlord who had 3 drolvargs beating on him) while my<br/>\ngroup took out a couple others.  unfortunately the warlord poofed when he<br/>\ndied, but<br/>\nhis sacrifice was worth it, Thanks Skeletal_Warlord!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
