Server wise, if someone is in a guild that would like to host<br/>\nthe event and provide lemming support (binding, resses for gnomes that<br/>\ndie along the way, etc, we will hold it there, otherwise, I&#39;ll just pick<br/>\none of the lesser used servers (heh, maybe a race war server)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the original post.<br/>\n<br/>\nDate: Thu, 7 Oct 1999 10:43:23 -0700<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\nI was wondering if enough people on the list would be interested for it<br/>\nto be worth organising a gettogether on one of the servers. As obviously<br/>\nwe couldn&#39;t do much serious adventuring with L1 characters for those<br/>\nvisiting from other server, I thought the alternative would be to do<br/>\nsomething silly.<br/>\n  <br/>\nAbout the silliest (and fun looking) thing I&#39;ve seen done so far is the<br/>\nnaked troll race. While I wouldn&#39;t want to steal that particular idea, I<br/>\nthink borrowing the concept is ok, so what I had in mind was something<br/>\ncalled the March of the Lemmings. The idea would be to all create L1<br/>\ngnomes and march all across Faydwer, take the boat to Freeport, then go<br/>\nup to Lavastorm and jump off the edge of the Solusek crater into the<br/>\nmolten lava. However, if someone can come up with a sillier or less<br/>\nderivitive idea, I&#39;m certainly open to that as well.<br/>\n  <br/>\nAnyone interested? How many people are on the list now?
