Im sure<br/>\nmy level 40 friend would of left him in the dust<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s still around when i hit level 50, we&#39;ve got another race to do, me<br/>\nand this little gnome<br/>\n <br/>\ni think i gave him a new respect for bards and their speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin Nehoc<br/>\nSol Ro<br/>\nLev 35 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hho@...\">hho@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hho@...\">hho@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tOctober 8, 1999 7:19 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] Speed of a bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hho@...\">hho@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hiya,<br/>\n&gt; Dont know if this is of any interest, but its bardic related.<br/>\n&gt; Inspirered by the thread about running back to your corpse I decided to<br/>\n&gt; time my<br/>\n&gt; run From Qeynos gates to West freeport through Highpass hold (Invisio on<br/>\n&gt; when I<br/>\n&gt; passed through there).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My stats: Woodelf bard, Level 22, Hand drum.<br/>\n&gt; The time: 31min.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While I was at it I also timed how long time it took me to zone (From<br/>\n&gt; &quot;loading<br/>\n&gt; please wait&quot; until I could move on the other side): 40-60 secs(Dont have<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; exact times here, but never above 60secs, that much I remember)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My pc&#39;s stats:<br/>\n&gt; P166MMX running 188/75MHz<br/>\n&gt; Flash3D voodoo I card.<br/>\n&gt; Win98<br/>\n&gt; 96MB Ram, BTW started with 64 in beta, My advice? 96MB is a minimum!<br/>\n&gt; Connection: ISDN 64Kbit/s<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Musiker Silverdrum, Bertox.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
