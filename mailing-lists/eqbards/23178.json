The Swamp is not a <br/>\npopular place because it&#39;s difficult to hunt in without ShowEQ or <br/>\ntracking.  You simply can&#39;t see far enough to find something to hunt, and <br/>\nsince it&#39;s such a wide range of creatures, higher level mobs can be right <br/>\non top of you before you even see them.  The tendency for mobs to hit the <br/>\nwater is also a problem for following and killing them - we&#39;ve all seen the <br/>\nwater warp in effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nLake of Ill Omen, on the other hand, is a nice, open, clear space that <br/>\npeople can hunt in, with a good range of monsters, few surprises, and even <br/>\nat peak population doesn&#39;t feel over-full.  Ditto for most of the zones you <br/>\ndescribed.  Smaller, enclosed zones where mobs can hit you through the wall <br/>\nare not as popular - and are only populated because of the phat lewtz they <br/>\nhave...<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n(Rejack the Iksar Monk went from 1-20 in the Lake)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
