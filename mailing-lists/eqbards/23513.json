But","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-858770177\">Perhaps he thinks since it&#39;s for other people&#39;s secondary characters that he&#39;s allowed to take it and sell it for himself or his own secondary characters. But if that were the case, then he should say that that is what he&#39;s doing and not just sneaking off and sell it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not only rude to you and your guildmates, but to anyone else outside of the guild that he plays with. It&#39;d make your guild look pretty bad if others are seeing this as well. And an officer?! Ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty uptight myself on things like this. I&#39;m not a moral beacon by any means, but this is pretty bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be best to talk to him personally about it. I&#39;d be careful about chatting with guildmates on this if your guild doesn&#39;t already have policies against behavior like this. I&#39;m sure he has lots of other friends in the guild as well. Lots of good guilds have fallen apart on much smaller issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Jan 24, 2001 at 03:20:48PM -0700, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I guarantee that if I didn&#39;t know/socialize with him in RL that would be the<br/>\n&gt; case for me as well.
