I only participated on a naggy raid and just went in <br/>\nordinary full lambent except for the helm (SSB sold my other helm a while <br/>\nback) and boots (singing steel). I think only other resist gear I had on me <br/>\nat the time was my runed bone fork. :-P I was given short notice, so I went <br/>\nthere with all I had on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, fully buffed, and weaving my rhythm songs my resists were probably <br/>\nin the 150-200 range. Never got feared, I don&#39;t remember if I got burned, <br/>\nbut it didn&#39;t matter anyway. All our tanks died against Naggy, leaving just <br/>\nme, an enchanter and a cleric in my particular group and Naggy at half health.<br/>\n<br/>\nA bard as the only tank left against Naggy is a bad thing. Had to have the <br/>\nrescue team scrape my armor off of his foot. :-P<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a pick-up dragon group, so by all means, wait until a well <br/>\norganized raid is setup. While they were good enough to get us through the <br/>\ngiants, they didn&#39;t have enough firepower to finish Naggy off (only 2 <br/>\nwizards). I believe a good guild can whip through and kill Naggie pretty <br/>\nquickly, maybe an average of 4 hours? Mine took almost 8 hours (including <br/>\nall the corpse recovery and resses afterwards). Ugh, quite the nightmare.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:47 AM 3/24/01 -0600, Bill Mann wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Another thing about raids that I learned not long ago...
