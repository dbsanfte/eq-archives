It<br/>\n&gt; says lull type spells work by reducing the aggro radius of<br/>\n&gt; creatures.  That would explain why sometimes Lament works (you<br/>\n&gt; get the &quot;sad&quot; message), but when you pull a mob, the mob you<br/>\n&gt; just Lamented still comes along.  If the mob you pull enters<br/>\n&gt; the Lamented mob&#39;s aggro radius, both will come.  I&#39;ve played<br/>\n&gt; around a bit with this with my enchanter and it really does<br/>\n&gt; seem to work this way.  If I lull the closer mob and pull the<br/>\n&gt; further one so it takes a path near the closer one, the closer<br/>\n&gt; one almost always joins.  If I lull the further one and pull<br/>\n&gt; the closer one, I almost always get it alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So when you Lament, be wary of the physical arrangement of the<br/>\n&gt; mobs, and the path they will take to get to you.  It&#39;s also<br/>\n&gt; possible that using a lute further reduces the aggro radius,<br/>\n&gt; as opposed to (or in addition to) increasing the duration of<br/>\n&gt; the Lament.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
