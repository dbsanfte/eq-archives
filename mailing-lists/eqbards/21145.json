It&#39;s a zone, like any other.<br/>\nIt&#39;s designed so that getting IN is hard.  But it&#39;s not designed<br/>\nspecifically to force a re-break.  If it were the entire zone would respawn<br/>\nat the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreak or not break doesn&#39;t matter.  Folks like Sartori just like to pretend<br/>\nthat you didn&#39;t &quot;earn&quot; your time in fear unless you broke it.  It&#39;s an ego<br/>\nthing nothing more nothing less.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe?  I&#39;ve done it both ways.  To be honest I could care less if a guild did<br/>\na fear &quot;Break&quot; or &quot;farmed&quot; repops.  Either way is fine by me.  Get your<br/>\ngear.  It&#39;s pretty needed in the later stages of a game.  I would say that a<br/>\nplayer with planes gear is about twice as effective in a group as one<br/>\nwithout it.  The added AC/MANA/STR/whatever is a huge bonus.  (why else<br/>\nwould everyone want planes gear?)  And it even helps when you&#39;re trying for<br/>\nKunark armor because you have that extra AC/Mana to take on those tougher<br/>\nharder dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\nCriticizing people for how they choose to get their gear is stupid.  They<br/>\npay $10 just like the next person.  How they play is up to them just like<br/>\nhow you play is up to you.  Sure farming repops is BORING, that doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nit WRONG.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo offense.. Been there, done that both ways.  Neither is right or wrong,<br/>\njust different.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf ya wanna go, go, don&#39;t worry about a damn &quot;break&quot;.  99% of the time on<br/>\nthe big servers the plane is already broken unless there&#39;s been a server<br/>\nreset anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath since Beta 2<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Daniel Sniderman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &quot;EQ Bards&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 28, 2000 11:57 AM<br/>\nSubject: FW: [eqbards] Plane of Fear<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; second attempt - seem to occasionally have problems replying even though I<br/>\n&gt; fixed prior problem..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 28, 2000 10:19 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Plane of Fear<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sartori - I just turned 48, and I&#39;m in a small guild.  But again - I just<br/>\n&gt; turned 48 - never been on a Plane or Dragon raid.  I know nothing of Plane<br/>\n&gt; Raids: Fear, Hate, Air, Breaks or Respawns except for whets been posted on<br/>\n&gt; this list - and the Backstage Forum.  And let&#39;s face it - there hasn&#39;t<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; much discussion of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I had no idea WHAT to expect.  I was there to learn.  I don&#39;t recall any<br/>\n&gt; discussion here of how respawns work in Fear and what to expect. No one<br/>\n&gt; promised me any treasure - no one called it farming.  I was simply asked<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; I wanted to &quot;join a raid on fear&quot;.  I posted my experience and asked a<br/>\n&gt; question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would love to participate in Breaking Fear.  It occurred at 7:30 AM my<br/>\n&gt; time while I was sound asleep (I am a professional musician and was<br/>\nworking<br/>\n&gt; until 12:30 the night before - had dinner with the guys in the band - got<br/>\n&gt; home at 3:30).  As soon as someone invites me to break fear - I&#39;m in.<br/>\nIt&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not like I can organize one myself having participated once in a respawn<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; never been on a break...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I posted what I posted to find out if this was typical; to find out what<br/>\n&gt; items do in fact drop there and to ask how the respawn works.  I posted<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; for all the other Bards who&#39;ve never been invited on a Fear Raid to know<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; experience AND HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT! (I sure didn&#39;t).  No one<br/>\nsaid<br/>\n&gt; they were farming treasure - no one promised me anything.  The only thing<br/>\n&gt; was a general belief that things start to respawn in numbers after a good<br/>\n&gt; 12-14 hours.  They organized 4 full groups expecting to need them all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I appreciate the information you posted, but I found your post to be<br/>\n&gt; patronizing, sarcastic and even insulting.  It seems to me that over the<br/>\n&gt; time, this board has been declining in tone.  I worry that we are getting<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; the point where people are going to be afraid to post something without<br/>\n&gt; being jumped on.  It&#39;s not surprising the number of people who have<br/>\nquietly<br/>\n&gt; disappeared from here and stopped posting.  It shouldn&#39;t be a crime to be<br/>\n&gt; wrong; and even worse - to have an opinion - and my God - asking a<br/>\nquestion?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: jay schultze [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 28, 2000 6:31 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Plane of Fear<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How does one go to an already broken Fear plane and not expect to be bored<br/>\n&gt; off his ass? The only time I could see this being even remotely exciting<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; if a GM showed up and re-popped the entire zone at once, which they would<br/>\n&gt; only do if some mobs were bugged.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As the other guys said, all imbrued armor is dropped in the Plane of Hate,<br/>\n&gt; unless you get lucky and see it drop on a cube in Fear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you want an exciting experience, try not farming Fear for once, and<br/>\n&gt; instead breaking it open on a full pop. You might actually have a<br/>\nchallenge<br/>\n&gt; *gasp* and fun. Instead of seeing maybe 2-3 dozen mobs in 5.5 hours, you<br/>\n&gt; will more than likely see 2-3 dozen mobs in your first couple hours,<br/>\n&gt; depending on how efficient your raiding party is. Not only will you kill a<br/>\n&gt; lot more in less time, but you will see more loot drop in a shorter amount<br/>\n&gt; of time. Last time I was on a Fear raid, we saw no less than 8 drops in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; first hour. It reminded me of the candyland that was the original Fear<br/>\nplane<br/>\n&gt; opening.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;d have to say that breaking Fear on a full pop is one of the<br/>\n&gt; most fun experiences I have ever had in EQ, next to maybe killing Trak.<br/>\n&gt; Kiting dracolich around is pretty fun too. =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People farming Fear and then wondering where the fun went baffle me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This reminds me of a running joke some friends have about farming Fear (if<br/>\n&gt; this offends any of you, oh well):<br/>\n&gt; Lleluvyn says, &#39;Hail there hardy adventurer, would you be interested in<br/>\n&gt; [Farming The Plane of Fear]?&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Kruegen says, &#39;How do I farm the plane of fear?<br/>\n&gt; Lleluvyn says, &#39;It is an easy task, done by many!
