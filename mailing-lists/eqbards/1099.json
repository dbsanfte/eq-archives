I figured<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;d be nice to be friendly with the paladin guilds and the<br/>\n&gt;diety description says many paladins follow Erollisi, so I<br/>\n&gt;picked it.  Now that I&#39;ve played the game some, the only<br/>\n&gt;followers of Erollisi I&#39;ve found are the Sisters of Erollisi<br/>\n&gt;in the Ocean of Tears. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve noticed the sisters of Erollisi &quot;kindly consider me&quot;<br/>\n&gt;instead of considering me amiably or indifferently.
