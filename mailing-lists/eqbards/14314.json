But ooh the downtime!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was part of an all caster group of six that ventured into the new Paw.  We<br/>\nhad 2 enchanters, a shaman, a cleric, a mage, and a wizard.  It was boring<br/>\nkinda.  We either annihilated the mobs we faced or got forced to gate real<br/>\nquick.  With 3 pets we were able to get away every time though.  If we&#39;d<br/>\nhave had 2 necros and just 1 enchanter and no mage I think it would have<br/>\nbeen even easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Wayne Sheppard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 03, 2000 4:07 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] RE: Harmonic&#39;s Super Rant Session (OT, very long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Harmonic&#39;s Super Rant Session (OT, very long)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I ask you this.  If all the caster classes were suddenly removed from the<br/>\n&gt; game would it still be playable at all?  I think not.  Removing all the<br/>\n&gt; hybrid and melee classes on the other hand would make the game much<br/>\n </span></blockquote>harder,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and maybe make some mobs impossible, but otherwise the game would still be<br/>\n&gt; playable.  To me that on fact is the ultimate statement of proof that the<br/>\n&gt; classes are absolutely not balanced.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thats funny.  My friends and I have been planning to test that very<br/>\nassertion.  We wanted to make a group of Bard, Warrior, Ranger, and 3<br/>\nPaladins (pallies get better heals plus Lay Hands).  We felt with 6 melee<br/>\ntypes, we could really do some serious damage.  We would have had a great<br/>\ntime thru the lower levels, but I could see possible problems at higher<br/>\nlevels.  By selectively taunting and backing out of combat, we could have<br/>\nspread the damage around quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nShop for your Valentine at eGroups.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine6\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine6</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
