To me the MR debuff from<br/>\nit was what attracted me to its use - we were fighting stuff that had high<br/>\nresist rates - ie my bellows were getting resisted so I figured other<br/>\ncaster(s) were facing same problem and maybe my de-buff MR would help. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe DoT may take 10-15 seconds to complete but the MR debuff lasts for 2<br/>\npulses or 6 seconds.  To maintain MR debuff long enough for the caster(s) to<br/>\nreceive benefit - bard would have to keep pulsing - which is what I meant by<br/>\nconstant singing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, January 04, 2000 12:23 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Question about 30th level song<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> \t\tOn Tue, 4 Jan 2000, James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; Hehe - John,<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; Which is better:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tConstantly singing Fulfil&#39;s is pointless since the song<br/>\nlasts<br/>\n\t\t10-15 seconds.
