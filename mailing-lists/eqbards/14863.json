So far, all the mobs I&#39;ve seen, unless they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a weapon or are buffed, swing once every 3.0 seconds.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s far easier to test it on level 1 mobs that can&#39;t double<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attack.  Just let it beat on you, chain/torgors it, and time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how long it takes between hits.  Or duel a shaman/enchanter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and time your own swings.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Because ice giants won&#39;t be missing you, and you won&#39;t be dodging<br/>\n&gt;   them, so your health bar will be the indicator of success ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Ice giants don&#39;t take their time swinging either.  It definitely<br/>\n&gt;   doesn&#39;t feel like 3.0 seconds between swings.  They are some of the<br/>\n&gt;   fastest attackers (maybe perceptively) around since they theorectically<br/>\n&gt;   are of level where you will see possible quadruple attacks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I can easily last twice to three times as long in toe to toe against<br/>\n&gt;   an ice giant with togors on it.  It would be obvious after chains<br/>\n&gt;   wore off (and didn&#39;t effect togors) if my survivability was still<br/>\n&gt;   intact.  Snakes don&#39;t offer such challenges, and you then need to<br/>\n&gt;   resort to logging and timing.  With larger npcs the dmg output will<br/>\n&gt;   be noticably different without parsing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get what you deserve with NextCard Visa.
