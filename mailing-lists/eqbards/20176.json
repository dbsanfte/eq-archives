Yes we can melee with weapons or fists, but that is not the<br/>\nreason why I have enjoyed my bard. The only intrinsic quality that I still<br/>\nenjoy in my bard is the fact that he is as good as I play him. Not many<br/>\nclasses enjoy that much control.  The idea that one would have to<br/>\nsit down and determine what to weave to achieve the optimal amount of<br/>\nimprovement.  Songs of the type where you are able to go into dumb mode<br/>\njust defeats the entire purpose of this whole weaving thing.  I have found<br/>\nthe greatest joy in watching the techniques of my bardic brothers and<br/>\nsisters and not in the monotonous action of pressing &#39;a&#39; and getting a<br/>\nsandwich.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again that is entirely my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nBard of Kelethin<br/>\nAdmirer of Bardic Tactics<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
