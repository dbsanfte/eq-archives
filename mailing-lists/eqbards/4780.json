I agree, with the additional point that if the GM s think its too much trouble to come and trade the items to me, then they should not be a GM, because","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1746886367\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;The problem appears to be fixed now so the point is moot, but I think that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;totally absurd that they encourage begging and twinking when it&#39;s extremely<br/>\n&gt;easy to see what level you are, and that you don&#39;t have any food, water or<br/>\n&gt;at the least, a default weapon. Now, if the GM&#39;s giving you your items back<br/>\n&gt;requires that they come to you, and trade the items to you then I can<br/>\n&gt;understand them not wanting to travel for hours to hundreds of people doing<br/>\n&gt;that. But if it&#39;s just a matter of typing something like &quot;give equip #104<br/>\n&gt;player_name&quot; then there&#39;s no reason for them not to have done it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree, with the additional point that if the GM&#39;s think its too much<br/>\ntrouble to come and trade the items to me, then they should not be a GM,<br/>\nbecause they either volunteered for the spot or they get paid for it.<br/>\nThankfully, the problem does seem to be over :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;My main complaint (sorry, ranting here a bit) now is that on Veeshan (and<br/>\n&gt;other servers) it seems that we get a 2 minute warning whenever the server<br/>\n&gt;is going to go down. Last night a GM comes on and makes an announcement that<br/>\n&gt;the server is coming down - log off now. About a minute later he makes<br/>\n&gt;another announcement. Then less than a minute later the server goes down.<br/>\n&gt;Now excuse the heck out of me, but what about people in the middle of<br/>\n&gt;seriously hard fights or deep in a dangerous dungeon? How about fighting in<br/>\n&gt;the water in the Oasis? They&#39;re supposed to leave the fight, get out of the<br/>\n&gt;water sit and camp (without being chased & attacked) within a minute or two?<br/>\n&gt;Methinks not. My aggrivation comes after having sat on the boat for 20<br/>\n&gt;minutes, hitting the final zone to my destination and then the server going<br/>\n&gt;down before I could reach the dock or jump in the water. Server comes back<br/>\n&gt;up and guess what.. I&#39;m in the OOT zone heading back to where I started,<br/>\n&gt;looking forward to another 30-40 minutes on the dang boat. Grrr.. A 10<br/>\n&gt;minute warning is all I ask. Is that so much? People on other servers said<br/>\n&gt;they get that, why can&#39;t Veeshan-ians?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ouch, that hurts.  For what it&#39;s worth, Brell players got the same kind of<br/>\nnotice that Veeshan players did:  hardly any notice at all,  I remember it<br/>\nbeing something like &quot;WORLD IS COMING DOWN, GET TO SAFETY AND LOG OFF NOW.&quot;<br/>\n Sheesh.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph M<br/>\nElwe--Half Elf Bard 8--Karana<br/>\nThambonae--Dwarf Paladin 24--Karana<br/>\nTongs--Barbarian Shaman 4--Brell Serilis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
