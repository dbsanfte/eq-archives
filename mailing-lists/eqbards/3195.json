Plus I got to actuall see one.  But I need <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know one thing.  What is the right price to pay for a Dragoon Dirk?  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; best place to get them is Felwithe right?  Its my understanding that <br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; come from crushbone.  Any help would be greatly appriciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve seen them going from 10 to 100 plat, honestly.  Twenty plat is <br/>\n&gt;probably a<br/>\n&gt;fair price for one though.  See if you can get it for less though by going<br/>\n&gt;right to the source!  I bet there are people camping Dvinn in Crushbone who<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t loot another one until they sell the one they&#39;re carrying, and would <br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;anxious to sell it quickly if someone had the cash.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  20 is a great price for this item...
