I have a feeling the<br/>\ncode tests against Level x 5 + 5 for the skill check and doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nallowances for the skill cap. It seems the logical explanation for why<br/>\nour 40+ songs are so hard to start.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
