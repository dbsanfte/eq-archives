The idea that Bards should provide their services for free<br/>\ngoes against my thoughts on why we are ALL trying to play Bards...we are<br/>\neach free to do as we please!  Some might want to charge an arm and leg<br/>\nfor their services (and sometimes that is a cheap price if a corpse is<br/>\nin deadly territory!), some might wish to gain a reputation for being a<br/>\n&quot;nice&quot; guy or gal and do it for free.  Nothing should be set in stone...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn point of fact I charge higher level folks more than I do lower levels<br/>\n- they have the means, they should know what they are getting into<br/>\nbetter, and if they really need a guide to their corpse I am willing to<br/>\noblige...for a price.  This doesn&#39;t make me greedy, if anything I think<br/>\nhigher level folk respect me more!  You put forward that we do this<br/>\nservice for free, then all we are is another aspect of the game to be<br/>\nused...like NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my plat and a half on the subject.  I too am on Cazic-Thule, seen<br/>\nyou around Pistov!  We should travel together sometime!<br/>\n<br/>\nShadren, a lowly Bard of the 8th circle<br/>\nOwner of the Commonlands Plateu!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
