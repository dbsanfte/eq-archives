I repeat, No one is off selling lambent armor<br/>\n&gt;parts for any kind of price at all, and people selling the lambent<br/>\n&gt;armor can&#39;t sell it for the obscene prices that items like gator legs<br/>\n&gt;go for simply because the quest/no drop quest item system works!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree vehemently.  Griffennes are camped nearly 24/7 on E&#39;ci regardless<br/>\nof the No Drop nature of the bard and shaman required items.  Only<br/>\ndifference is most people leave them on the corpses for free.  If Griffenes<br/>\nwere even remotely rare, you&#39;d never see one cause they are worth good xp.<br/>\nI see more dead Shin corpses in L Guk with No drop stuff rotting on them<br/>\nthan I do ones waiting to be killed.  way more, again cause they are worth<br/>\ngood xp and easy to single out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only difference is the items lay around for free.  The mobs are not<br/>\nwaiting around for some needy bard to come along and kill them.  Same with<br/>\nshamans needing mammoth ribs.  has mammoth killing suddenly ceased because<br/>\nthey have a No drop shaman quest item, of course not.  The reason no one<br/>\nsells lambent is it is not worth the effort.  To get a piece of lambent you<br/>\nhave to spend a couple hundred plat on gems, go to at least three different<br/>\nzones to hunt things, and find a buyer.  The money produced per time unit is<br/>\nridiculously bad compared to camping for a non-lore magic item you can sell<br/>\nfor the same amount.  Don&#39;t assume cause and effect occur and are related.<br/>\nThe &#39;cause&#39; of Lambent quest items being No drop has no correlation to the<br/>\n&#39;result&#39; of Lambent armor not being sold.  When was the last time you saw a<br/>\nRain Caller for sale?  It&#39;s not No Drop.  The quest is however a pain in the<br/>\nneck that takes a long time and much effort to solve.  I&#39;m still working on<br/>\nit, but at least I have the Fairy Dust now.  How about crafted?  those quest<br/>\nitems ae No drop but it is sold all the time.  Why?  Because the Crafted<br/>\nquests require a heck of a lot less running around.  I haven&#39;t been to an<br/>\nauction since about a week after the quests were implemented where crafted<br/>\nwasn&#39;t for sale, and being sold successfully.  I have sold 2 pieces myself<br/>\nand traded one to a guildmate.  All for profit.  No drop quest items did<br/>\nabsolutely nothing to deter me from doing so.  I doubt the warrior market is<br/>\nany bigger than the bard market.  I&#39;ve likewise made 2 pieces of shaman<br/>\narmor so far and traded them to guildmates for other stuff I could use.<br/>\nAgain No Drop did nothing to deter me.  If however, the armor itself had<br/>\nbeen No drop what would have changed?  I wouldn&#39;t have done the quests<br/>\nprobably, and my Shaman guildmates wouldn&#39;t have the armor.  Did I deprive<br/>\nany poor Shamans of getting their piece of armor?  Nope, there were zero<br/>\nshamans hunting tentacle terrors in Najena or Mammoths in everfrost when I<br/>\ngot my pieces, cause if there had been I&#39;d have let them loot the items.<br/>\nWhy were there zero Shamans hunting these things?  Because the quest is<br/>\ninvolved, takes a lot of travelling, and they didn&#39;t think it worth the<br/>\ntrouble.  Totemic Gloves were not worth the time to the shaman&#39;s in my<br/>\nguild, but they were worth the cost of the Dufrenite plus a decent magic<br/>\nitem I could only get if I camped some spawn point for hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest I am glad the quest items are No Drop because it means someone<br/>\ndoes have to do all the running themselves to get the item.  Not necessarily<br/>\nthe Shaman though.  If some shaman wanted to trade me Lambent for Totemic<br/>\nI&#39;d be ecstatic, but they don&#39;t want to do all that running.  So maybe you<br/>\nhave convinced me that No drop does do something if used in the intermediate<br/>\nstages of a quest.  It ensures that people who really enjoy doing quests and<br/>\ntravelling will be able to complete them.  To make the reward No drop as<br/>\nwell so that I could gain no benefit from the quest would deprive me of the<br/>\nchallenge I most enjoy in this game.  In fact, it has already tempted me to<br/>\nquit as more and more quests produce No Drop items.  Believe me though when<br/>\nI say this, It is the complex, involved, time-consuming nature of the quests<br/>\nthat prevent the wizard Ks&#39;ers from doing them in order to sell the final<br/>\nproduct.  Not the fact that the intermediate items are No drop.  If<br/>\nanything, the No Drop nature of the intermediate items increases the market<br/>\nfor the final product, because buyers/traders know they can&#39;t just buy the<br/>\nintermediate items in one location and do the quest themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMake intermediate items No Drop, that will not prevent anyone who wants to<br/>\ndo quests from doing them but will ensure whoever does the quest will have<br/>\nto do all the running around themselves, i.e. someone will have to spend<br/>\ntime doing this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t make the rewards No Drop because it isn&#39;t necessary to prevent someone<br/>\nfrom selling the item for ridiculous prices or preventing legitimate item<br/>\nusers from getting the items.  Making the quest even slightly complex with<br/>\ntime consuming travelling will ensure this never happens, the people who<br/>\nengage in those sort of activities are way too lazy to get involved in<br/>\nanything like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Shining Star of Light quest is the easiest quest for a magic weapon in<br/>\nthe game.  I can regularly sell them for 50-75pp nonetheless.  The people<br/>\nthat buy them could usually do the quest themselves in their sleep, but they<br/>\naren&#39;t interested in all that running around, all that interacting with<br/>\nnpc&#39;s.  They just want to kill things, plain and simple.  Despite having<br/>\nregularly sold SSoL&#39;s at auction, I rarely see anyone else selling one.  If<br/>\nthose KS&#39;ing wizards can&#39;t be bothered to do an incredibly simple quest like<br/>\nthis, why would you think they&#39;d ever do a more involved Lambent one?  Even<br/>\nmore ridiculously, I can sell 4 pairs of bear Hide boots at every auction if<br/>\nI cared to.  Very few if any other people do so, yet they sell for 5-10pp<br/>\nand cost less than 2pp to get.  You don&#39;t even have to travel across zones<br/>\nto do it and few can be bothered.  so if you want to make intermediate items<br/>\nNo Drop, more power to you and Verant, but don&#39;t make the final result No<br/>\nDrop because making the final result No Drop solves nothing and only hurts<br/>\nthose who enjoy doing whatever quest comes their way and are happy to<br/>\nreceive the reward they get.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n\tQuesting somewhere on E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
