I use<br/>\nthis, combined with Chain and invis to pull blue mobs past<br/>\nhoards of greens all the time.  The Chain is crucial though,<br/>\nbecause you need a head start for the invis to work.  <br/>\nOtherwise you&#39;ll get attacked, canceling the invis, and the<br/>\ngreens will aggro on you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But the last time I was in the King room, we were getting steady pulls.

I&#39;ve also consistently found the area<br/>\nfrom the king room to the pool room uncamped - maybe because<br/>\nyou need either a huge group, or an enchanter/bard/monk to<br/>\nsplit the spawn there.  It&#39;s been my favorite hunting area for<br/>\nthe last several nights.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and more froggies beating on him. I paniced and feared them off.  Heh, well,<br/>\n&gt; its been a while since I&#39;d seen quite so many froggies all at once (when<br/>\n&gt; they came back with a bunch of friends.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh.  If it&#39;s conceivable that you may have to resort to this,<br/>\nmake sure your ranger/druid snares everything at the start of<br/>\nthe fight.  Then you can fear them and they won&#39;t get far.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; which dungeon and what song.  Fearing frogs in the King room is still a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;no-no!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You need to keep tabs on how your puller is pulling and<br/>\nmonitor your tracking list.  Frogs you fear in the king room<br/>\nonly get about as far as the pool room, and you should&#39;ve been<br/>\npulling everything up to there to being with.  If your puller<br/>\nkeeps you informed of where he&#39;s pulling from, you should know<br/>\nbefore you fear what extra mobs you&#39;re likely to pick up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, fear is not just handy for emergencies.  It can be<br/>\nuseful if your group just needs a short 10 second breather for<br/>\nthe healers to heal multiple people who are low.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
