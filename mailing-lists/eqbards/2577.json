We&#39;re at the genesis of an entirely new form of social<br/>\nplayground.  All that stuff you&#39;ve been reading and hearing<br/>\nabout virtual reality?  Well it&#39;s starting to take form, here,<br/>\nnow, first with MUDs, now with games like UO and EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real world doesn&#39;t quite know what to make of all this.  <br/>\nHeck, they didn&#39;t even know what to make of software when it<br/>\nfirst became commercialized.  That lead to widespread piracy<br/>\nwith little enforcement of copyright laws.  That&#39;s slowly<br/>\nchanging as the software industry has legitimized itself in<br/>\nthe eyes of the everyday Joe.  Then came the Internet and we<br/>\nhad the same thing all over again, with email harassment/spam,<br/>\ncopying web pages, hacking networks, etc.  Slowly people are<br/>\nbeginning to take these crimes seriously as if they&#39;d<br/>\nhappened in the physical realm instead of in electronic 1s<br/>\nand 0s.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we&#39;re creatinging virtual worlds.  They&#39;ll start off<br/>\nunrespected, with no consequences if you &quot;cheat.&quot;  Eventually<br/>\nthey&#39;ll gain respect and people will accept them as an<br/>\nextension of the real world.  Will virtual cheating be taken<br/>\nas seriously as real world cheating?  I don&#39;t know, only<br/>\nhistory will answer that.  But the concept of banning,<br/>\nexpulsion, and fines for cheating or harassment in a public<br/>\nentertainment venue is not alien.  Look at professional<br/>\nsports, theme parks, public playgrounds, etc.  Cheat, cut in<br/>\nline, abuse the other players or spectators, or generally make<br/>\nan ass of yourself, and you&#39;ll get tossed out in a jiffy or<br/>\neven jailed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake notes.  Your grandkids will want to know what the world<br/>\nwas like before all this.  Just like you asked your<br/>\ngrandparents what the world was like before airplanes and TVs<br/>\nand automobiles.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
