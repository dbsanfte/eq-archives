In either case, Abashi has stated that if you didn&#39;t open <br/>\nthe doc file, you are fine.  If you did, you are SOL - Verant is keeping <br/>\nmum about a solution.  Of course, you should always have a virus scanner <br/>\nrunning (says the guy without one) and never open anything from someone you <br/>\ndon&#39;t know and/or trust (yadda yadda).
