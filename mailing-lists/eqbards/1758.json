I think it&#39;s a quirk in<br/>\nthe AI, though it may be an intentional one.  When I was level 12 or so, a<br/>\nfriend and I were hunting earth elementals in Steamfont.  We had killed a<br/>\ndozen of them or so, when all of a sudden ALL the earth elementals in the<br/>\nzone came after us.  I died trying to save my friend, as invariably<br/>\nhappens.  In any case.  It&#39;s a neat feature, whether intended or not.  I<br/>\nhave seen it happen on other occasions as well, for example, hunting gnolls<br/>\nin east karana.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:41 AM 6/10/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Douglas Bierbower &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bierbower@...\">Bierbower@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here is a thought and a story, maybe even a partial solution.

I am not kidding.  This happened.  It was rather convenient, but<br/>\n </span></blockquote>eventually<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;became overwhelming.
