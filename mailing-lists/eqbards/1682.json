Sadly, though,<br/>\nother than Drelzna in Najena (who drops bronze VERY rarely), you can afford<br/>\nreal plate or quest for rubicite by the time you can expect to get medium<br/>\nbronze in Mistmoore or Nagafen&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, the advantage bronze has over banded is minimal, especially when you<br/>\nconsider the weight difference between medium banded and medium bronze.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s only a few pieces of med. bronze I&#39;d consider wearing over banded,<br/>\nboots and gloves, and one of them, the gloves, you can&#39;t get in banded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Unrest is such a FUBAR zone, it promotes small race twinking, as the<br/>\namount of small bronze you can pull out of there in an evening, especially<br/>\nif you&#39;re a low STR finger waggler and can&#39;t use it anyway, means you&#39;re<br/>\nquickly weighed down, and end up just giving the stuff away, or selling dirt<br/>\ncheap.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention the fact that Bertox had such an imbalanced group of Unrest<br/>\nhunters..two druids and a cleric early on, with no tanks in the party that<br/>\ncould use the bronze, that led to a lot of it being dumped on the market to<br/>\nmuch lower level players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen by the time THOSE players could farm for bronze, they already had it,<br/>\nand the trickle down continued.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other factor..every race/class combo that can wear small bronze pays a<br/>\nhigher exp penalty than humans or half elves..this tends to balance it out<br/>\nsomewhat, even if it isn&#39;t itentional.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Mott, Mike J. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MIKE.J.MOTT@...\">MIKE.J.MOTT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 09, 1999 10:38 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Imbalance between Bards that can only wear medium sizes<br/>\nand bards that can wear small and medium sizes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Mott, Mike J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MIKE.J.MOTT@...\">MIKE.J.MOTT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;First off let me say I am sorry about the post yesterday when I forgot to<br/>\n&gt;remove all of the rest of the digest in my reply - I wont let that happen<br/>\n&gt;again!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am a lvl 22 bard on Bertox and I have begun to notice a severe imbalance<br/>\n&gt;between myself and my wood-elf brethren.  Medium sized bronze armor is<br/>\n&gt;almost impossible to come by (i myself have NEVER seen any for sale) and<br/>\n&gt;small bronze plate armor is relatively easy to get.  Other bards who are<br/>\n&gt;able to wear the small bronze plate are much more viable at my level than<br/>\nI,<br/>\n&gt;simply because they have the ability to absorb more damage than I do with<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt;banded mail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does anyone have a suggestion for this dilemma?  I am currently searching<br/>\n&gt;for spots where I can maximize my money making potential so i can pick up<br/>\n&gt;some select peices of plate mail, or other lighter magical armors that<br/>\nmight<br/>\n&gt;be for sale.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dont get me wrong - I am not whining!  I just would like to find something<br/>\n&gt;to up my armor class which has not changed much since 14th level, when you<br/>\n&gt;take out the Defense skill increases that you get with each level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lago Bardoon, the relatively easy to hit 22nd Rank Bard of Bertox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
