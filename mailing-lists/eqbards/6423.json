There are basically two types of skills to<br/>\ndevelop while playing EQ.  Character skill (e.g. high 1h slash skill) and<br/>\nPlayer skill (the ability to twist songs, and juggle equipment). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there is a limited number of actual character skills out there, the<br/>\nnumber of techniques that a Player can implement are vast.  Knowing which<br/>\nsongs to load for an area, knowing the areas layout all make your character<br/>\nmore successful.  Classes like warrior (not to knock them) are inherently<br/>\nmore Character based and less Player based.  This is why I think that most<br/>\nof us are drawn to bards in the end.  We can put more of ourselves into our<br/>\ncharacters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if I were to give my account to a newbie player he would have a<br/>\nlot of investigating and dying to do before he/she (the person not the<br/>\ncharacter) would have the skill to wield the character in an effective way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, a Warrior (the opposite of the spectrum) given to a<br/>\nplayer would be relatively easy for them to catch on to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that everyone who plays a Bard may not (be<br/>\nable to or even want to) become the song twisting keyboard mouse Ninja that<br/>\nwill bring the most out of their Character.  But everyone has that chance.<br/>\nAnd I like it.  If practicing difficult techniques to work around that tough<br/>\nmonster gets nerfed, it will be a really sad day.  I hope IM not rambling<br/>\ntoo much, but I think you&#39;ll get my point.<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin 19th Human Bard<br/>\non Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
