I wondered about harmony after I went in. He was concerned about how <br/>\nto break the camp and I&#39;m not that familiar with harmony. I know harmony <br/>\nlowers the aggro range of a creature, but if the creature is out of range <br/>\nof harmony, wouldn&#39;t it still get pulled?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, there&#39;s 4 spectres on each corner of the square island and 4 <br/>\nin the tower (I really don&#39;t know the exact number. Never ran into there <br/>\nwith full spawn). I wouldn&#39;t know how the range would keep the ones in the <br/>\ntower from aggroing, unless you can get close enough to them to harmony <br/>\nwithout line of sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t too worried anyway since I handled the multiples pretty easily. <br/>\nBut it is good to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other concern is etiquette. Nobody was around the spectres and the <br/>\nisland was unbroken. As soon as I broke the spawn there were 3 other groups <br/>\nwho jumped in and started pulling spectres. One even ran us over with their <br/>\npull while we were medding and healing. I guess it&#39;s bound to happen since <br/>\nI&#39;m pulling the spectres so far away. Seems rude on from one perspective, <br/>\nbut from another it seems inevitable unless you are sitting smack dab on <br/>\nthe island.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
