I am assuming<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; one of them is the dirk.  What is the other?  I had let my pierce skill<br/>\n&gt; slack quite a bit, so I got out my dirk and a FS dagger.  That was the<br/>\n&gt; first<br/>\n&gt; time I had used two piercers at one time.  With the quickness spell from<br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter friend of mine, I was a quisinart.  Also I liked the rogue look<br/>\n&gt; that it gave me.

Eventually I moved<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; 2<br/>\n&gt;   slashing weapons.  And now at 36, I&#39;m back to 2 piercing weapons :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Basically, once you hit 17, you&#39;ll be dual wielding the rest of<br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt;   life.  I don&#39;t know any bard that uses a shield (though it is possible)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Don&#39;t forget your 1h blunt also.  Mine is only about 120 now,<br/>\n&gt;   instead of 185 where all my others are.  It&#39;s just that to me, no 1h<br/>\n&gt; blunt<br/>\n&gt;   weapons are really that good, so I haven&#39;t really botherd with it much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
