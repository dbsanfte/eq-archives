Usually happens after a long, nasty lag bubble. I&#39;ve<br/>\nalso noticed it occur after those spinning stuns that seem to last forever.<br/>\nWhen I come to, the song buttons are available (not grayed) but a song is<br/>\nstuck on. (I&#39;m always thankful when it&#39;s heal or anthem and not CoD!). Can&#39;t<br/>\nstop it or start another - get the message &quot;Your song ends&quot; after the<br/>\nbuttons flicker gray momentarily. Next time I will try the /stopsong command<br/>\nmentioned here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother song problem: Have any of you twisted 3 songs, say Warsong/CoD/Hymn,<br/>\nand had a song just drop because the message order got screwed  up? It seems<br/>\nto happen when the timing is very close on a song refresh so I&#39;m thinking it<br/>\nis a client/server lag thing. For example:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou whistle an ancient warsong<br/>\nYour song ends<br/>\nLady Vox winces (a HEF can dream, right?)<br/>\nYour song ends<br/>\nLady Vox dies (in my dream CoD is really strong)<br/>\nYour wounds begin to heal<br/>\nYour song ends<br/>\nYou whistle an ancient warsong<br/>\nYou stop whistling<br/>\nYour song ends<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice the last three lines. If I had not refreshed the song in time, it<br/>\nshould say I stopped whistling *before* starting again and the icon should<br/>\nblink briefly. But here the result is that the icon goes away and stays off<br/>\nfor at least one full cycle. Has this happened to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\nTonedeaf Tenor<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Christopher Andrews &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmandy_drew@...\">cmandy_drew@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 26, 1999 3:17 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Song probs?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Christopher Andrews&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmandy_drew@...\">cmandy_drew@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    i&#39;m glad to see it&#39;s not just me having this exact problem...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    yesterday alone i encountered two separate occasions when i could not<br/>\n&gt; sing a song due to another song being what appeared to be &quot;locked&quot; into<br/>\n&gt; verse. now the peculiar thing was that one of these times, i was in east<br/>\n&gt; commons grouped with another bard, and some others. i decided since i was<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; little higher than he was, to sing my hymn song instead to heal up the<br/>\nparty<br/>\n&gt; a wee faster. his song ended. i attempted to start my hymn. did not<br/>\ntake...<br/>\n&gt; at all. i tried maybe 20 times. grrr... this wasn&#39;t the first time it had<br/>\n&gt; happened to me, so i didn&#39;t panic. i simply zoned. it seems to fix the<br/>\n&gt; problem, but isn&#39;t necessarily something you want to do while either<br/>\n&gt; fighting some mobs, or trying to heal your party while preparing for the<br/>\n&gt; next battle.<br/>\n&gt;    even while i was running towards the zone, i asked the other bard to<br/>\nsto<br/>\n&gt; singing his song again. he did once more. i was maybe half the zone away<br/>\n&gt; from him and still kept getting the message &quot;your wounds begin to heal.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; hmmm... i left clicked on the icon to try removing the effects that way.<br/>\n&gt; also no luck. well since i was at the zone, i went ahead and did the sure<br/>\n&gt; fix.<br/>\n&gt;    is this happening with any other bards? what could be the problem?<br/>\nmaybe<br/>\n&gt; an incidental bug included with the last patch. or is what Sylly was<br/>\n&gt; discussing having to do with lag and spikes? i didn&#39;t experience any of<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; if i recall correctly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pava<br/>\n&gt; Bard in the 13th measure<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yesterday, the lag was incredible.  Constant 15% to 35%, surges and<br/>\nspikes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;into red with 50% to 80%.  Other players all complaing.  Some guys<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dumped and coming back only to be nekkid and bind spot - never seeing a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So, rather than venture into some hard dungeon, I was helping a group do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;HG&#39;s off the wood bridge in North Karanas.  Staying back, buffing and<br/>\nmana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;song.  So, then I decide ok, let&#39;s try Denons with horn and see how he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;likes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it.  Great - he&#39;s wincing away nicely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Then my friend Kaldivar comes by and asks about fenne&#39;s and charms.  So,<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;say follow me I can show you a Grifxxxx spawn spot - do you know where<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;named treeant is? (By now you should have a pretty good idea of what is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;coming next.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On the way there, I cant get selo&#39;s to lock and stay up.  I click, it<br/>\ntrys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;then stops.  I start whining about lag and how weird this is a cant make<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;songs play, etc. etc. Just as we get to that little tower, I look up and<br/>\ngo<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;hmmm, wonder why the tree is moving around like that?&quot;  Followed shortly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;you are burned&quot; and whoof 2 plus bubs of hp dissappear.  Btw: Kaldivar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;says<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;oh I dunno, he is red to me&quot; Hehe - I start running away and frantically<br/>\n&gt; &gt;yelling &quot;ZNE, ZNME, ZONE!!&quot;  You are burned. Another 2 bubs gone and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;glimpse of the goodie werewolf hunter chasing me as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Now I am keying and clicking Selos very, very fast and desparately trying<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for a zone.  Praise the Gods!  It finally stuck and I escaped to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Western<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Karana.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So, all I can think of is Denons was locked on - due to some lag bug?<br/>\nSelos<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would not start and since there is no icon and were no other mobs being<br/>\nhit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- there was no screen message to see.  But seems even wierder than that.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;scrolled back to see what spell he was casting and do not recall seeing<br/>\n&quot;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Xannthoulos winces&quot; message.  Not that is some strong &quot;bard hate&quot; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that likes you attacks you!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;After a bit, the lag seemed to settle enough so I went and helped my<br/>\ngroup<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kill spectres.  Even with 3 and 4 of them getting pulled, it seemed<br/>\nalmost<br/>\n&gt; &gt;too easy.  Of course we did have an enchanter handling the crowd control.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;She could park them as necessary while we feared (although not the bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fear) and killed the others.  Hehe, spectres are too easy.  Never thought<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would be saying that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bard of the 34th song<br/>\n&gt; &gt;somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
