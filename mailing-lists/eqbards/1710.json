I am assuming they are getting the definition<br/>\nfrom AD&D, where Bards were traveling musicians but kept<br/>\naway from direct combat and never wore heavy armor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNorrath is a world created by taking small ideas from all the <br/>\nother RPG&#39;s that are out there.  The designer&#39;s version of a <br/>\nbard is different than bards that we know.  The designer&#39;s version<br/>\nof a gnoll is different than any I have encountered (gnolls in AD&D<br/>\nare 7&#39; tall, the gnolls in Norrath are short - unless you count that<br/>\nGiant Gnoll) :).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a RPG situation, I see no valid restrictions on Bards not wearing<br/>\narmor  plate for the fact they can&#39;t move enough to play their songs.<br/>\nIf that were the case, warriors would not be able to use a bow while<br/>\nin plate, no one would be able to run, etc. There is no single reason<br/>\nwhy Bards should not be able to wear plate.  The argument &quot;It is not<br/>\npart of a roleplaying environment&quot;  is wrong.  The way Norrath has<br/>\nbeen designed it *IS* in the roleplaying environment.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, June 09, 1999 3:31 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eqbards] Bards N Plate and people&#39;s opinions<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From what I&#39;ve seen the bards in Everquest are nothing like the &quot;bards&quot; of<br/>\n&gt; the celtic tribes as you describe them here.  The bards of everquest<br/>\n&gt; travel,<br/>\n&gt; sing songs, and play instruments.  They are in fact travelling musicians,<br/>\n&gt; which you said the celts were not.  I could handle bards wearing chain in<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; roleplay situation, however, not plate.  This is my opinion, and I feel<br/>\n&gt; both<br/>\n&gt; sides need to be expressed with minimal sarcasm (which is why i<br/>\n&gt; appreciated<br/>\n&gt; that post, not nearly as much sarcasm).  It&#39;s understandable that most of<br/>\n&gt; you want to retain the ability to wear plate, but I fail to see a valid<br/>\n&gt; argument from a roleplaying point of view for the allowance of plate on<br/>\n&gt; bards.  This is not to say that I&#39;ll not wear plate, because I&#39;m not THAT<br/>\n&gt; commited to convictions.  -=) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ka`Lend<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Okay that&#39;s it I&#39;ve about had it my fellows of song.  It&#39;s time for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reality check.  I roleplay.. the fact that I have a bard since day one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; release and am only level 13 attests to that.  Infact I have on more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then one occasion parited with groups above my exp gain level for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sole purpose of helping them and recording their first visit to a new<br/>\n&gt; land.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unlike many I&#39;m willing to bet I also sing sea chanties on boatrides,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make little poems for each of my songs (lyrics) etc.  I also game,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have fought wisps till blue in the face (anyone else pissed at the<br/>\n&gt; nosave<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now turned burned out lightstone bull?) and have kited,soloed, grouped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and twisted with the best of them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m tired of seeing this roleplay plate mail talk and quite a few<br/>\n&gt; others,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; let me give you abit of backround.  The EQ bard seems to me best<br/>\n&gt; compared<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the CELTIC bard.  It&#39;s important to understand the Celtic bard as<br/>\n&gt; opposed<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what we have come to call a bard.  The religion of the celts being<br/>\n&gt; Druidic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was split in several sections with three primary universal among the<br/>\n&gt; tribes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The preist/mage type the ones we typically see in flowing robes and call<br/>\n&gt; druid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that most RPG&#39;s consider.  The judge section Gaelic Brehon (sp) who<br/>\n&gt; administered<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clan law and succession issues. And the Bard who recorded the histories,<br/>\n&gt; told<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the tales, taught the faith, ran the messages, recorded the liniages<br/>\n&gt; etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The celtic bard was by no means some weak pansy musician, nor a figure<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lightly.  The bard seldome directly fought in wars but was certainly<br/>\n&gt; often<br/>\n&gt; well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trained in arms and would often run into situations in his travels where<br/>\n&gt; fightin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was needed.  In the period Plate was not an option and so from a<br/>\n&gt; historical point, the bard would not have worn plate, however the Celts<br/>\n&gt; did<br/>\n&gt; invent chain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and that being the strongest of the time would have worn that if they<br/>\n&gt; could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; access it (bards of the stonger clans) so there is no reason to say they<br/>\n&gt; would reject plate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for your kindred spirit?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Go to ONElist: where kindred spirits connect and stay connected.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
