Weeeeeelll - apparently, an &quot;undocumented feature&quot; of those two <br/>\nsongs is a slight magic resistance debuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuardian Rhythms only purpose is in twisting multiple songs in the Rhythms <br/>\nlines, and ONLY if you are already twisting the other two.  It gives the <br/>\nsame AC and MR bonus as Purifying and Elemental, but without anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nPsalm of Vitality appears to have a slight disease-removal effect.  Purity <br/>\nseems to remove poison, and<br/>\n<br/>\nFufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant only does 1/4th the damage of the Discord, but it <br/>\nDOES have a better MR Debuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nPsalm of Warmth gives Infravision, Cooling gives Ultravision.<br/>\n<br/>\nDenon&#39;s Dissension is a mana-debuff, but since NPC&#39;s don&#39;t USE mana, it&#39;s <br/>\nutterly useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuyen&#39;s Chant of Flame/Frost supplements it&#39;s weak damage by adding a <br/>\nFire/Cold resistance debuff (So theoretically, they&#39;ll take more damage if <br/>\nthey resist less?  Stick with Denon&#39;s.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSyvelian&#39;s is exactly the same as Alenia&#39;s as far as the data file is <br/>\nconcerned (except for the material component in Alenia&#39;s)<br/>\n<br/>\nMystic Shielding seems to have an unknown effect, as well as a DoT <br/>\neffect.  How strange.<br/>\n<br/>\nNiv&#39;s, from the looks of the effects will add a rune-like coat of <br/>\nprotection, as well as healing, AND giving you an HP buff AND a decent STR <br/>\nbuff.  Wow!! Nice song (if it works...)<br/>\n<br/>\nChord&#39;s of Cessation adds a damage effect to it&#39;s slow-down, however, it&#39;s <br/>\nslow-down is no more powerful than the Chains.  If anything, it&#39;s worse <br/>\nthan chains, because while they both slow down attacks, only chains slows <br/>\nmovement.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd man - I can&#39;t wait for Verses of Victory (level 50) That is one SWEET <br/>\nsong ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll information comes from the spdat.eff and/or spells.eff files, <br/>\nreliability subject to Verant&#39;s programming abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Researcher</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
