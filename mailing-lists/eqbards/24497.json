Having a party member root is your best bet.  When I got to 53 I<br/>\nnever used charm again.  Charm is capped at 51 level mobs anyway - that will<br/>\nstart being an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 53 Song of Twilight will become your bread-and-butter crowd control song.<br/>\nIt&#39;s the only song that lasts 4 pulses not 3; and doesn&#39;t have a random<br/>\nduration - it always lasts the full 24 seconds.  Therefore - hypothetically;<br/>\nwith no resists and no lag issues, etc - you could keep 4 mobs mezzed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that VERY difficult - but I can keep 3 mobs (excepting highly<br/>\nresistant ones) mezzed indefinitely.  It can be very difficult if they are<br/>\nbunched together - especially like named mobs; but with a good group that<br/>\nknows how to spread them out - you should be able to handle a four pull<br/>\nwithout too many problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Grady [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john_grady@...\">john_grady@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 16, 2001 10:27 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Question on Lute of the Howler and Crowd Control<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo separate questions really. First, none of the normal sites seem to<br/>\nhave information on what drops a Lute of the Howler. Can anyone fill me in<br/>\nplease?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, on crowd control, how do you fellow bards handle groups of 4+<br/>\nmobs? I can easily handle mobs #2 and #3 with charm, but if no one is<br/>\nsmart enough to root #4 the group is in trouble. Mezz isn&#39;t reliable,<br/>\nespecially while trying to control a pet, and there&#39;s usually no room<br/>\nindoors to kite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTzeetch<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
