(although it may have been safer there, maybe<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; should try it) I&#39;ve seen and contributed to many of the posts. But when I<br/>\n&gt; read Abashi&#39;s reply, I honestly believe he has absolutely no idea what we<br/>\n&gt; are talking about when we reference the problems with chains and lullaby.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Quote:<br/>\n&gt; ------<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m not sure what is supposed to be wrong with chains. Some changes were<br/>\n&gt; put in to put in a maximum amount that a creature could be slowed prior to<br/>\n&gt; applying any slowing related to damage. The change was intentional.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for lullaby, I just said in another thread that Ester, the one who was<br/>\n&gt; going to look at this, is on vacation, and I&#39;ll have to check with her<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; she gets back. Now that I think of it, I think I may remember someone<br/>\n&gt; stating that lullaby&#39;s current functionality is intended, as it&#39;s the only<br/>\n&gt; thing to keep them from trivializing encounters. I&#39;ll have to check with<br/>\n&gt; Ester when she gets back to be sure.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Like you, I refuse to believe they are outright lying, so I come to the<br/>\n&gt; conclusion that he has no clue. He remembers the patch that nerfed chains,<br/>\n&gt; but he doesn&#39;t know how it affected the lower level song. Again with<br/>\n&gt; lullaby, he remembers the last time it was looked at, but doesn&#39;t know<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; we still see a HUGE problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m hopelessly optimistic and refuse to see the truth that is<br/>\nevident,<br/>\n&gt; but I just can&#39;t imagine that he knows and is covering it up. Instead I<br/>\n&gt; think that he is hopelessly swamped by email, message board postings and<br/>\n&gt; whatever other work he may have and in that mountain of information, ours<br/>\n&gt; got pushed to the bottom and  never seen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.

John Kim and myself have broken the<br/>\nthings<br/>\n&gt; down statistically to the point where it was readily apparent that the<br/>\n&gt; resist rates were down to tenths of a percent with variances of +/- 2<br/>\ntenths<br/>\n&gt; of a percent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is ABSOLUTELY no way they can claim they don&#39;t know what we think is<br/>\n&gt; wrong with these songs and still be truthful.  They ARE ignoring us.<br/>\n&gt; (Harmonic is gone right?  If not, my apologies Harm)<br/>\n&gt; Well maybe they aren&#39;t ignoring us, but in that case they are purposely<br/>\n&gt; lying to us instead.  I prefer to assume the former.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi Faegehearper<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) They aren&#39;t ignoring us. Instead they just have no idea that we think<br/>\n&gt; there is a problem that needs to be looked at. Abashi is a busy man, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that he missed our<br/>\n&gt; posts or forgot them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) If we can make them aware of what we think is wrong, then we can get<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; to look at it and there is a possibility that we can get it fixed. This to<br/>\n&gt; me is good news. The only problem is how to get our thoughts looked at. I<br/>\n&gt; suggest we write up a concise description of the problems. (insane resist<br/>\n&gt; rates on pixie strike and lullaby and ineffectiveness of snare since the<br/>\n&gt; patch) then we post it to the bug board and the gameplay board, as well as<br/>\n&gt; emailing it to abashi.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
