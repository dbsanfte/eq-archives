The moment<br/>\nthe EQ team started down that path, most of these command line changes were<br/>\ninevitable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat you guys need are programmable keyboards&#92;keypads.  I have a<br/>\n58-key programmable keypad I use to do all sorts of things -- its primary<br/>\nuse however is to give me direction keys on BOTH ends of the keyboard, as<br/>\nwell as a better layout for hotkeys, etc.  Not to mention I can switch<br/>\nhot-key banks, and press a hot key button with a simple push of a key.<br/>\nSince the implementation of all these keyboard commands, I can do damn near<br/>\nany command or sequence of commands in EQ with my keypad at the push of a<br/>\nsingle button.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe price range of the programmable keypads on the internet is<br/>\nanywhere from 24.95 (a cheap 20-key type) on up.  There are two available<br/>\nfrom one particular company in 20 ($85) and 58 ($130) key models that allow<br/>\nkey labeling and everything .  If you guys are interested I can post some<br/>\nlinks for your perusal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Well now there&#39;s a reason for us to use the /stopsong command. BTW, from <br/>\n&gt; the example 100 = 10 secs, so time increment would be close to 50. You&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; also limited to 5 lines. Lastly, the pause command can be stacked, but<br/>\n&gt; must <br/>\n&gt; be listed first on the same line. Something like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /pause 50 /cast 1<br/>\n&gt; /stopsong<br/>\n&gt; /pause 50 /cast 2<br/>\n&gt; /stopsong<br/>\n&gt; /pause 50 /cast 3<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; May need to change the time increment to allow for general lag, but that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; what testing is for. Also, there&#39;s no space for an additional &quot;/stopsong&quot; <br/>\n&gt; to stop song # 3, so I guess this isn&#39;t a whole fix-all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More interestingly, my enchanter buddy is lamenting this new addition and <br/>\n&gt; feels it&#39;ll take any skill out of EQ. Enchanters can now set up macros to <br/>\n&gt; continually re-mesmerize things since they know exactly how long something<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; will wear off. He mentioned that Verant was against macros from the <br/>\n&gt; beginning and is wondering what has changed to make them implement this. <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s pretty much against this enhancement. I just gave him the, &quot;Back in<br/>\n&gt; my <br/>\n&gt; day we actually had to push the buttons &quot; tease and told him he doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; have to use it if he doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I look forward to using this to weave Hymn and Clarity during down times. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll actually be able to take somewhat of a break, just repressing the hot<br/>\n&gt; key.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---Windleaf<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 12:25 PM 9/28/00 -0600, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yes that&#39;s true but what if you inserted a command before the one to turn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;off the song that could only be executed to turn one off and would fail<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;turn a song on?

It&#39;ll be fun to test!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;*Pauses in Socials*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.<br/>\n&gt; /pause<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the<br/>\n&gt; number<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;For example, a social consisting of:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;/sit off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;/cast 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;/pause 100<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;/sit on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10<br/>\n&gt; seconds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;after you&#39;ve STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;same line.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;For example:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;/sit off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;/pause 100,/cast 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;/sit on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;another, and MUST be specified first on the line.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
