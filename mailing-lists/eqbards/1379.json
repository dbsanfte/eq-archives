It works best with<br/>\nmobs who think they can kill you.  Don&#39;t waste it on greens cause once<br/>\nthey get too damaged they&#39;ll run.  Don&#39;t try it on red guys cause your<br/>\nbrusco may not work on them but it is great on blues, whites and most<br/>\nyellows.  I think it best to do it with things that you will benefit a<br/>\ngreat deal from doing it with cause it is obviously pretty time<br/>\ncomsuming for just one kill.  I hear some people do it with COD but I am<br/>\nnot brave enough for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nCooter<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mr. Beeba [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:flpmc@...\">flpmc@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 2:03 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] What is Kiting?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mr. Beeba&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:flpmc@...\">flpmc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question...what is kiting and how is it done?
