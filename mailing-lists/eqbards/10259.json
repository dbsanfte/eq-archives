When you get Dual Wield at<br/>\n17th, your skill is already (level * 2).  I know this only because when I<br/>\nbecame a Guide (a Bard, BTW) I was buffed to Apprentice Guide status (level<br/>\n20) by the server&#39;s GM.  So off I went at level 20 without having trained<br/>\nany skills.  Guides and GMs are just player characters, so I had to start<br/>\npounding my Sense Heading button to train the skill up.  Much to my surpise<br/>\nmy first increase was &quot;You have become better at Sense Heading(41).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> (scott brisko)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I had an odd experience with training or not training duel wield.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hit level 17 and decided to head back to Kelethin to pick my new song. I<br/>\n&gt; knew that I could now use duel wield and that I probably need to<br/>\n&gt; point into<br/>\n&gt; it for it to work, but I forgot to train in Freeport before I<br/>\n&gt; left, and then<br/>\n&gt; when I arrived at Kelethin I forgot to train  there as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now back in Freeport I went to the guild intent on putting some<br/>\n&gt; points into<br/>\n&gt; duel wield before I returned to hunting in Oasis. But to my<br/>\n&gt; surprise when I<br/>\n&gt; scrolled down to duel wield in the skills window I did not see<br/>\n&gt; the friendly<br/>\n&gt; &quot;no charge&quot; text, but a charge of 1 plat 3 gold. Hmmm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So off I went to oasis, equipped my dwarven axe and combine longsword and<br/>\n&gt; proceeded to pound crocs..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You have become better at duel wield (35)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I am stumped. I never tried to use two weapons before, didn&#39;t train it,<br/>\n&gt; and all of a sudden I am starting out with a skill of 34.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bernwyn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 10:22 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] dual weild<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well you are able to live without putting a asingle point into<br/>\n&gt; the skill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It will take forever to get the first few points through actually using<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.  I tried to do begging from scratch while waiting for the boat.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think I had to hit that button about 200-300 times before I got the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; begging(1) message.  What can I say I took the boat a lot in my<br/>\n&gt; youth back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the days when there was only one boat travelling from<br/>\n&gt; Butcherblock and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Freeport ^_^.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, 17 Nov 1999, Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like many skills (e.g. warrior&#39;s double attack) i thought we<br/>\n&gt; had to put<br/>\n&gt; 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; skill point into duel wield to learn the basics.  could be<br/>\n&gt; wrong though<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
