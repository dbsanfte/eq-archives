There is a group here who believe it is the enormous number of items<br/>\never growing in the character databases that Verant is concerned about.  By<br/>\nmaking them No Drop they were trying to keep the number of in game objects<br/>\ndown.  An interesting speculation and a reason why it took so long to get<br/>\nthe bank set up to accept No Drop items perhaps.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Blair, Keith (Keith Blair) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 07, 1999 1:48 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Lighstones was Re: Elf Hide Gloves<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lightstone or not.
