DOH!  I will never make that mistake again!  What I did <br/>\nlast night after reading this message: I took all the cat pelts i had <br/>\nlooted in freeport back to kelethin (where there are no cats) and <br/>\nsold the medium quality ones for 2pp each.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest question is,  How do I know what prices pelts go for?  I <br/>\nam starting to become quite the fur trapper, and I think I can fund <br/>\nmy blacksmithing lessons by selling fur (i am always going back and <br/>\nforth between freeport and g.faydark)  I tried to look for others <br/>\nauctioning pelts but didnt see anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe some kind soul can list fair prices for the cat and bear pelts, <br/>\nmainly so i don&#39;t feel like i am ripping other PC&#39;s off, but also so <br/>\ni dont rip myself off.  I was asking 5pp ea. for HQ cat pelts last <br/>\nnight and i got one &quot;no thanks.&quot; was that too high a price?  I did <br/>\nmanage to sell 5 medium quality cat pelts for 2pp ea., and a bunch of <br/>\nspiderling silks for 1 gp ea.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr perhaps there is some internet site out there that lists this kind <br/>\nof thing?  all i found so far on the net are people auctioning armor <br/>\nand weapons and such...  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this isn&#39;t too off topic.<br/>\n-fohat, level 11 half-elf Quelious Bard on Firiona Vie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In eqbards@y..., Bill Costlow &lt;atlatyl@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Fohat,<br/>\n&gt; Magical weapons are always dropping in price and one of the best <br/>\ntimes to buy them is during off-peak hours in the Commons.
