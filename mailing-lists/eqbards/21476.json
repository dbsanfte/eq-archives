Another aspect of the Haste change.  While groups<br/>\nmay have used the bard haste speedups when all the melee people had haste<br/>\nitems, now they will all want better haste buffs from an enchanter.  Once<br/>\nagain bards will be pushed out so that enchanters will be needed in groups.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as a cleric in my guild pointed out.. how is Mark of Karn so<br/>\nimbalanceing when there are what like 7 copies of it on our server?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark <br/>\n&gt; of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less <br/>\n&gt; desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its <br/>\n&gt; duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; <br/>\n&gt; value decreased.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
