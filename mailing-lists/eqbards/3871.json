I take the damage, everyone else<br/>\ndishes it out. Everything attacks me anyways, so I might as well just jump<br/>\nin there and help out. Full platemail and good agility means that when<br/>\nthings hit me, they don&#39;t do much damage. Even sand giants seem to miss<br/>\nabout 80% of the time, and I&#39;m only level 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe heal song is almost useless in battle. You heal far far far less damage<br/>\nthan you could dish out by arming weapons and singing the bellow. (Or<br/>\nanthem for those of you who think it works well).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great bard tanking method comes when fighting multiple mobs at the<br/>\nsame time. In this case, I always play Denon&#39;s. it does about 25 - 30<br/>\ndamage (that&#39;s an estimate) per tick PER mob. So not only are you dishing<br/>\nout 70 damage per tick, but your group can concentrate on one mob while the<br/>\nyou tank the other two. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil Tearsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
