Within a single level, <br/>\nthe variability seems to be as much as 400%.  I do think that you lose <br/>\nsignificantly more in Hell Level + 1, and you APPEAR to lose significantly less <br/>\nin Hell Levels, but each bubble requires much more exp than the preceding (or <br/>\nsucceeding) levels there, and I think the net exp loss is about the same as a <br/>\nnormal level.  It would not be unlike Verant to &quot;play dice with the universe&quot;, <br/>\nconsidering that the amount of lost exp that is restored by Cleric spells is <br/>\nrandom within a set of defined parameters (e.g., 0-25%, 0-75%).<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 36 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 3 Jan 2000, Daniel P.
