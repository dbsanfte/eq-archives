So far I hadn&#39;t got as far as picking a server or<br/>\n&gt; time/date. My initial post was just floating a balloon to see if anyone<br/>\n&gt; was interested. As to server/time, if there&#39;s enough interest, I will<br/>\n&gt; try to coordinate a time that is most convenient to all who want to<br/>\n&gt; attend. Server wise, if someone is in a guild that would like to host<br/>\n&gt; the event and provide lemming support (binding, resses for gnomes that<br/>\n&gt; die along the way, etc, we will hold it there, otherwise, I&#39;ll just pick<br/>\n&gt; one of the lesser used servers (heh, maybe a race war server)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s the original post.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thu, 7 Oct 1999 10:43:23 -0700<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if enough people on the list would be interested for it<br/>\n&gt; to be worth organising a gettogether on one of the servers. As obviously<br/>\n&gt; we couldn&#39;t do much serious adventuring with L1 characters for those<br/>\n&gt; visiting from other server, I thought the alternative would be to do<br/>\n&gt; something silly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About the silliest (and fun looking) thing I&#39;ve seen done so far is the<br/>\n&gt; naked troll race. While I wouldn&#39;t want to steal that particular idea, I<br/>\n&gt; think borrowing the concept is ok, so what I had in mind was something<br/>\n&gt; called the March of the Lemmings. The idea would be to all create L1<br/>\n&gt; gnomes and march all across Faydwer, take the boat to Freeport, then go<br/>\n&gt; up to Lavastorm and jump off the edge of the Solusek crater into the<br/>\n&gt; molten lava. However, if someone can come up with a sillier or less<br/>\n&gt; derivitive idea, I&#39;m certainly open to that as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone interested? How many people are on the list now? Maybe we should<br/>\n&gt; put up a poll to see who would come.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Phayde t&#39;Blaak  - L49 Bard - Tarrew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject lol.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
