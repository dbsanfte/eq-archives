Keep it from dumping on somebody,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and B.  be a decent bit of risk.  Still tedious as anything though :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I just dumped EQ_shamans because the whining over there was irking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;me so much that my aggravation spilled over here.  My fault, sorry.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On bard related issues, if they did the same thing you suggest to our<br/>\ndamage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;songs, how much use would they be in a group?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If your group is able to deal with multiple deep reds to the point where<br/>\n&gt; Chords (or Denon&#39;s) is a primary song, perhaps we need to re-examine your<br/>\n&gt; methods.  Both Chords and Denon&#39;s should be wonderful for white/black and<br/>\n&gt; below, and somewhat useful vs. yellow.  But to allow one song to equally<br/>\n&gt; effect multiple reds is a tad ... overkill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nErr, you&#39;re right.  I was trying to make an analogy to another class that<br/>\nis heavily dependent on their dot&#39;s, and already not the most group oriented<br/>\nclass.  Necros aren&#39;t bringing much to the party to start with, make it too<br/>\ntough for them to stick a dot and .... ?<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I&#39;d imagine that, if your party has multiple wht/blk + mobs on it,<br/>\nand<br/>\nyour trying to use CoD or DDD, then you&#39;re on the way to corpse recovery :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Talies<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congrats to our GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out ONElist&#39;s latest program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
