I don&#39;t like FFA loot at all, for three reasons:  1)  it cheats the <br/>\nspellcasters, who are too far from the action to get to loot the &quot;good&quot; bodies <br/>\n(plus I&#39;d rather have them sitting on their tushies medding than running around <br/>\nmadly trying to get their fair share of treasure); 2) nobody ever thinks that <br/>\nthey&#39;re looting their fair share of FFA bodies; and 3) too many people leave the <br/>\n&quot;junk&quot; bodies behind, then mentally count them off against you if you choose to <br/>\nloot them yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care if split is on or not; I usually call no-split because it evens out in <br/>\nthe long run, and some people really don&#39;t like it.  (I think their reasoning is <br/>\nwrong; I don&#39;t believe that auto-split makes change, it just divides up whatever <br/>\ncoins are there, which doesn&#39;t increase the total amount of copper or silver.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not high enough in level to have gone to places where there is one uber-mob <br/>\nand a bunch of much less worthwhile loot targets.  It seems that random selection <br/>\nis reasonable here, although alpha loot starting at a random spot in the alphabet, <br/>\nthen ensuring that the older party members get a loot before replacements, seems <br/>\nmore equitable.<br/>\n  <br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 32 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
