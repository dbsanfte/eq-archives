Is it <br/>\nsort of like being charmed for a bit? Or do they not work well on players <br/>\nat all?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo idea what you could solo, sorry.

I play some odd hours, wake <br/>\nup in the middle of the night and need my EQ fix etc. : ) I would love <br/>\ninput into what I could possibly solo at my level.  I use a demon claw and <br/>\na tomahawk as weapons, and seem to use bellow alot in fights.  Also keep in <br/>\nmind that since I am on PvP I can not use all songs the same way other <br/>\nbards do.  If anyone is around my non-party spells effect them and I hate <br/>\nto go around putting everyone to sleep all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nInfiniti</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
