Constant<br/>\nresists made it pretty ineffective in my eyes, and yes I do have a<br/>\nhigh cha boosted by all and sundry.  Still appeared unreliable to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen casters came along, I&#39;ve tended to boost resists on the party and<br/>\njust let the casters in our group zap them to little pieces faster<br/>\nthan they kill us.  There&#39;s something satisfying about watching a big<br/>\nbad something zap one of my party members with something nasty and see<br/>\nnot even a sliver of health go down.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own crowd control is usually charm above everything else since it&#39;s<br/>\nthe only one that&#39;s reliable, although after exploring my young<br/>\nenchantress I see now how much more limited it is, and I&#39;m thankful<br/>\nfor all that nice blue armour!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wed, 12 Jul 2000 12:15:14 -0500, &quot;Daniel Sniderman&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I meant to post here but forgot.
