Apparently they were trying to tell the &#39;good&#39;<br/>\naligned PC&#39;s something, but I&#39;m not sure they got the chance.  At least one<br/>\nperson of a good aligned race of high level was instrumental in slaying some<br/>\nof these &#39;good&#39; npc&#39;s.  Apparently a druid or two dedicated to Tunare<br/>\nactually killed their own fellows and earned the wrath of several other GM&#39;s<br/>\n(instant death)  as far as I can tell from guild reports there was no<br/>\nretribution on &#39;evil&#39; pc&#39;s who were killing the &#39;good&#39; npc&#39;s, only on those<br/>\nwho did not role-play their allegiances accurately.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone been in Kithicor since?  I am very curious what I will wake up to<br/>\nfind there and how I will escape level 40+ mobs when I am camped about dead<br/>\ncenter of the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n\tSomewhere in Kithicor?<br/>\n\tMay Marr protect me!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
