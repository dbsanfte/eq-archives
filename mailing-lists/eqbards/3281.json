I<br/>\npersonally prefer MM, but you will not be able to get any good items there<br/>\nbecause you will be fighting the yard trash near the entrance.  If you fight<br/>\nin Unrest, you can get better items by pulling or camping deeper inside the<br/>\nhouse.  But, you will probably have to deal with the crowds of people.  On<br/>\nTarew Marr, MM usually has about 25 people in zone, 45 at peak times when<br/>\nhigher levels decide to storm the castle.  Unrest usually has 40 people min,<br/>\nand sometimes goes well into the 80s.  BTW, both zones count as outdoors, so<br/>\nyou can sing Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to solo, you could try the Iron and Stone Guardians in Nektulos<br/>\nForest.  The great thing about them is that any PC can outrun them, so they<br/>\nare trivial to kite.  I found them perfect for levels 19 to 21, but then<br/>\nleft out of boredom, not lack of experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother spot you might like to try is Lake Rathetear.  You can fight Aviak<br/>\nGuards solo (look around) or you can group and fight at the Gnoll/Undead<br/>\ncamp during the night.  And, just over the zone, you can fight all kinds of<br/>\nAviaks in South Karana.<br/>\n<br/>\nBanilore Bel&#39;Canto<br/>\n22nd Level Half-Elf Bard<br/>\nMaster Brewer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
