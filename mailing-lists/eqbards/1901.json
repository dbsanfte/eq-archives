Actually, on Solusek Ro, people were claiming that &#39;BB is down again...&#39; The said that everytime the boat docked then ButcherBlock crashed (wonder if this has something to do with the new boat code they put in.) Anyway what really was upsetting about it was we invited a Dwarven Paladin into our midst. He died....And never returned. Several &#39;/who Pene all&#39; revealed that there was no such player on the system, yet he was still prominently displayed in our team listing. Any attempts at modifying the group (inviting new players, removing Pene, disbanding the group completely) resulted in &#39;Error, not all group members available for operation. Operation aborted.&#39; Must&#39;ve been a heckuva night...<br/>\n<br/>\nLulen<br/>\n8th Rank<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sharon Mock <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 14, 1999 01:27<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [eqbards] Boat Crashes -- Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really, really doubt this has anything at all to do with bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My husband and I ventured into ButcherBlock for the first time today.  Briefly put -- it was broken.  For some reason, the client-side locations and the server-side locations (of players, critters, etc.) refused to stay synched.  Sounds like the same problem as that that of &quot;falling off the boat.&quot;  BTW, the boat was apparently sometimes crashing the BB zone, although we didn&#39;t experience that for the several hours we were there.  (At least we didn&#39;t notice it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ever wondered how you can explore new regions, find profitable new critters (a giant scarab is a thing of beauty), have only one person die once, and STILL have a lousy time?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Zak, where did you go?  I don&#39;t see you.&quot;<br/>\n  &quot;Hold on, I&#39;ll find you...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  (three minutes later)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Zak, why are you running around in circles?&quot;<br/>\n  &quot;I&#39;m NOT!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  (three minutes later)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Zak, you didn&#39;t really run up that cliff wall, did you?&quot;<br/>\n  &quot;No....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  You get the idea.  It didn&#39;t matter whether I auto-followed or did it by sight, he&#39;d still disappear on me.  And we didn&#39;t have this problem in Faydark.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anybody know if this is a Xegony-only problem (memory leak?) or if it&#39;s something broken system-wide?<br/>\n<br/>\n     -- Cypraea, level 8 tree-huggin&#39; bard (Xegony)<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n  From: &quot;Daniel P.

What would happen is first all the other players on the boat would disappear then you&#39;d get dumped...  The first time I was back on the dock in BB then next time on the boat on the way to BB and then finally on the boat on the way to Freeport.<br/>\n     <br/>\n        The reason I bring it up here - is that several whiny players claimed that the cause of the crash is bards playing songs on the boat...  The first time I was in fact playing a song and thought that it might contribute.  The second time - no bards were playing (assuming no one in the hold was) and it crashed anyways.  I think this was true the third dump as well.  <br/>\n     <br/>\n        So I am wondering if people have any experience in this.  My gut is that there is no relation between the two - and this is yet another myth (like all bard songs will require mana!)<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Slyde of Xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
