This is the base minimum you can have, and<br/>\n&gt;therefore roll to  (ie: /random 1 20)<br/>\n&gt;For your first raid, you get 30 points (this is to help folks who may not<br/>\n&gt;belong to any of the 3 guilds, yet are along to help)<br/>\n&gt;If you stay for a whole raid, you get 30 points (shorter raids get smaller<br/>\n&gt;points)<br/>\n&gt;If you stay for 2 hours to about halfway, you get half points<br/>\n&gt;If you pass on a roll for your class (that isn&#39;t junk) you get an extra 5 or<br/>\n&gt;10 (can&#39;t remember which) points per pass (this helps folks who are only<br/>\n&gt;after one or two items)<br/>\n&gt;Winning something knocks off 10 points (although I would like to see it<br/>\n&gt;dropped to base 20), and you are not allowed to roll again until everyone in<br/>\n&gt;that class has won something (unless it&#39;s an uber item).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One of the main reasons for this was fairness.  We wanted to be able to<br/>\n&gt;reward folks for coming on raids they wouldn&#39;t normally go on (Clerics in<br/>\n&gt;Fear) without over-penalizing folks who can&#39;t make it due to RL.  We also<br/>\n&gt;wanted to set up a heirarchy so that folks who only needed a few items would<br/>\n&gt;have a better shot, without using level as a point-modifier (therefore<br/>\n&gt;encouraging p-leveling just so you can be the highest level and get a better<br/>\n&gt;chance at something).  This gives EVERYONE a shot at an item, the more<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;ve won, the less of a shot youhave.  The more you&#39;ve gone on and the<br/>\n&gt;more loot you&#39;ve passed on, the better a shot you have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We have also broken loot into 3 gropups:<br/>\n&gt;trash (ie: Imbrued bracers)<br/>\n&gt;Common (legs, arms, bps, etc)<br/>\n&gt;rares (rare and god drops)<br/>\n&gt;Trash loses no points for being looted, and gains no points for passing<br/>\n&gt;(trash is determined by a class beforehand)<br/>\n&gt;The rares and god drops will most likely be NBG or straight /random if more<br/>\n&gt;than 1 is deemed in need<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=B=-<br/>\n&gt;49th Season of Bardic Fun<br/>\n&gt;New OutRiders<br/>\n&gt;The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is there a maximum to one&#39;s roll? ie.
