And like a<br/>\ngood group we were waiting patiently for our turn for<br/>\ngood ole Mr. Tae.  Well group A is sitting on the<br/>\nthrone almost when he spawns so they jump him.  Some<br/>\none /shouts Tae and chaos insues.  Our group jumped in<br/>\nthe fray after group A&#39;s casters had dumped their<br/>\nmana.  Not knowing if I had time to get charm off (not<br/>\nto mention resist rates on yellows) I hit it with a<br/>\npixie strike.  It was below half health when our 1<br/>\ncaster unloaded.  We got the kill.  Not bad.  BTW I<br/>\nlove cazic, no place I have ever found where a bard is<br/>\nso useful for crowd control.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\nSo why is it called strike if they just fly around<br/>\nyour head?<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
