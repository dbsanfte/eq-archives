I am<br/>\npretty certain that Verant spoke about adding new creatures, and<br/>\npossibly races, and who knows what else (spells, items). All of this on<br/>\ntop of the more than likely two new continents. How is this going to<br/>\naffect the gameplay?

All of the new zones, creatures, etc could be kept to<br/>\nthe new continents. But what about the boat to get there? Would someone<br/>\nwithout the expansion not see it? Would they be magically barred from<br/>\nentering it? I&#39;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that it<br/>\nwill all work great when it comes out, but these are questions that I<br/>\nwill have nonetheless until then.<br/>\n<br/>\nMandibal<br/>\nTravelling Trouvere<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 6   Date: Wed, 28 Apr 1999 11:53:54 PDT<br/>\n   From: &quot;Jack Naugle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zendarin@...\">zendarin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Reply to accusation that Verant isn&#39;t effective.<br/>\nWhoa. Ease up there Gabriel. Take a look at how many years it takes <br/>\nto develop a game like this. Of course they are working on an <br/>\nexpansion. Otherwise, LONG after the current bugs are fixed people <br/>\nwould be complaining there were no MAJOR updates cuz the expansion <br/>\nwould still be a year down the road. Just because they are looking <br/>\nahead and planning expansions to the game doesn&#39;t mean they have <br/>\nstopped working on the current issues, they are announcing fixes to <br/>\nexisting problems every week on EQ vault and EQ Stratics. <br/>\nLet&#39;s stop complaining about everything under the sun and give Verant <br/>\nsome credit for designing the most awesome online game to ever come<br/>\nalong.<br/>\nZendarinThe Wandering Minstrel<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for the perfect gift for a friend?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nTell them about ONElist&#39;s 130,000 free e-mail communities!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
