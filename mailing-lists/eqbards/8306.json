For example, an ogre shaman is standing in front of you<br/>\n&gt;and starts casting a spell.  As soon as you see the text message that he has<br/>\n&gt;started casting the spell, you start singing the teleport song and<br/>\n&gt;successfully teleport before he finishes casting the spell.  The teleport<br/>\n&gt;could move you behind the shaman (no longer in his line of sight) or move<br/>\n&gt;you further away out of the range of the spell.  Would you still get<br/>\n&gt;affected by the spell?  If not, would the shaman lose the mana?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Point #1 - they don&#39;t care where you are, they can still target you,<br/>\nteleporting doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\nPoint #2 - Mobs (monsters/NPCs, etc.) have no Mana as PCs do.
