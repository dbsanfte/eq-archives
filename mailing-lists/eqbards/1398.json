My part hunted<br/>\n&gt;Mistmoore for the past 3 days and we hunt right at the zone.  Well...either<br/>\n&gt;Mistmoore is bugged or my area song is hitting the npcs you hear casting<br/>\n&gt;through the walls, because we have had trouble with those same npcs coming <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;the zone and killing us all when we did nothing to provoke them. The AoE<br/>\n&gt;songs I used were fear, lull, and denon&#39;s. My only conclusion is that my <br/>\n&gt;song<br/>\n&gt;radius is reaching them, I tried to talk to a GM who just told me that <br/>\n&gt;higher<br/>\n&gt;lvl dungeons need a bit of tweaking.  If anyone has any other information <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;love to hear from you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Summer Du&#39;Soleil<br/>\n&gt;Bardess of Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>DAMN does this bug still exist???<br/>\nI&#39;m not looking forward to going to Mistmoore, but I will probly head there <br/>\naround 20th because I&#39;d love to own some lupine items.<br/>\n<br/>\nEver since beta3 Mistmoore has had a bug where if you brush or touch the <br/>\nwall near zone (not sure which wall, I think the left one) it will cause a <br/>\ntrain from back of zone to come kill you. It was VERY annoying. I hear <br/>\nTanara (a VERY nasty female DE vampire) used to be attracted to zone this <br/>\nway. I also hear she is no longer in Mistmoore?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, one time this happened and she was stuck at zone (kinda like Dvinn <br/>\nbeing stuck at zone in Crushbone, only FAR worse as she can charm you). <br/>\nThere were about 20 ppl outside afraid to go in because of her so we <br/>\npetitioned a GM. Forget his name, but a 50th lvl wiz GM showed up, went <br/>\ninside and shortly thereafter appeared in our midst naked, and muttering <br/>\n&quot;stupid wench...&quot; So we all went in with him and helped kill her.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure if the wall thing is what is happening to you, but I would suggest <br/>\nNOT touching the walls, as the bug may still exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 15th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
