The only way I see this weapon being worth a flip is if<br/>\nits a proc, the proc lasts a descent amount of time, and you find yourself<br/>\nin a group without a bard/enchanter or shaman.  Otherwise I think its<br/>\nnothing more than eye candy.  Dont get me wrong I like good looking gear I<br/>\nhave a set of wicker armor I wear on my Iksar monk from time to time when<br/>\nI&#39;m just trying to look &quot;cool&quot;  hehe.  But unless you are rich or really<br/>\njust want to look good I think the weapon is going to be over priced.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill borred at sea for another 2 Months 2X days.  : (<br/>\n<br/>\nMu  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, July 20, 2001 4:54 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: AW: [eqbards] Katanas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is definitely a twink weapon.

That&#39;s pathetic.  The haste is irrelevant<br/>\nas<br/>\nyou can only have one haste item and one haste &quot;spell&quot; at any given<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n5dmg is dreadfully low and there is a limit as to how low, even with<br/>\nhaste,<br/>\nthe dly on a weapon can be.  Max haste isnt that hard to get, and 5/24<br/>\nis<br/>\nrotten, jade mace 9/18 less than 10k on my server and I am sure lots<br/>\ncheaper<br/>\non others.  If you are just looking for the looks then maybe you will be<br/>\nhappy with it.  But as a weapon for anyone high enough to actually group<br/>\nand<br/>\nget it.  You probably already have better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
