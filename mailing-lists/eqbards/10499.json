Your advice on where to go for<br/>\n&gt; him is good.  His problem seems to be finding friends to play with.  Stay<br/>\n&gt; out of Sol-A - yes - especially if you do not have a good group.  Even if<br/>\n&gt; you do - lo to mid 20&#39;s can be bad if you go to the wrong places.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know where the easy places are.  When my group went (former group I shud say<br/>\n&gt; - they are all hi 40&#39;s now and &lt;snif sniff&gt; I am stuck in 36 =( ), we tried<br/>\n&gt; the bar room at 28ish and got spanked badly (cleric, bard, de sk,<br/>\n&gt; necro/enchanter, troll war, ranger).  Later, when we were lo 30&#39;s and had<br/>\n&gt; more experience in knowing what to clear first etc. we could take and hold<br/>\n&gt; these rooms fine and get good xp and good loots. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This raises a good point as well, and that&#39;s learning where the &quot;safe&quot;<br/>\nspots are to work when you are exploring a dungeon. The bar room, IMO,<br/>\nis a classic example of a bad place to pull to or try to set up a base<br/>\nin an uncamped dungeon. It has 3 different ways in in an area where<br/>\nthere are lots of wandering mobs with a large agro radius. Talk about a<br/>\ndisaster waiting to happen. We found at the relatively low level we went<br/>\nthere that the stair well up and around the corner from the bar room was<br/>\na way better place to set up our base while we cleared that area. A good<br/>\npuller needs to learn to recognise those spots where wandering mob<br/>\nactivity is light and the chance of an unexpected respawn won&#39;t tip a<br/>\nfight into disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, SOL-A seems good to me - hard yes, but once you hit the &#39;prime&#39; level<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s good. I see these low to mid 20&#39;s running in and out and wonder where<br/>\n&gt; they are going - I guess I need to explore it more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mid 20&#39;s would do ok to the left after you get past the trap<br/>\nroom. Down that way is the kobold predator and the foreman, and neither<br/>\nof them or the mobs around are particularly hard or hard to get to. By<br/>\nthe late 20&#39;s, if you have a druid in your group, you can start to work<br/>\na little deeper as you now have an evac&#39;r if things really hit the fan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dungeons you do in groups and try to be at the prime level - too young and<br/>\n&gt; you get spanked; too old and there is no xp and maybe still get spanked by<br/>\n&gt; trains of greenies.  Solo, well you need to be pretty powerfull so that<br/>\n&gt; rules bards out unless you are really way above the mobs and still trains of<br/>\n&gt; greenies can kill you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good advice. If you have a good group though, and want a challenge and<br/>\nan experience that only the fastest levellers ever had when they first<br/>\nexplored places like lower guk, the under used dungeons like perma and<br/>\nsol b can still provide it, while lower guk has become so overcamped<br/>\nthat you&#39;ll never be able to explore it that way on a mature server.<br/>\nJust try to avoid printing out and using the maps on the spoiler sites<br/>\nif you want to play that way, as that can take the fun of exploring away<br/>\ncompletely.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
