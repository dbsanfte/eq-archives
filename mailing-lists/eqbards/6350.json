ADM is up at 22nd.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;ve read on this list the my fellow bards have not been able to figure<br/>\nout if Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody does anything of value.  I recall that<br/>\nthe discussion centered around the song &#39;not removing harmful effects or DoTs&#39;<br/>\nor something to that effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe title of the tune though is &quot;Disenchanting&quot;.  This implies to me that it<br/>\nremoves magical enchantment from *items*.  Since it is unlikely to remove the<br/>\nMAGIC status of a weapon altogether, perhaps it removes &quot;procs&quot; that a weapon<br/>\nmight have.  Has anyone gone into an Arena, run ADM and seen if procing<br/>\nweapons didn&#39;t proc on you?  Maybe a Staff of Writhing and a PGT against you<br/>\nand ADM?<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.
