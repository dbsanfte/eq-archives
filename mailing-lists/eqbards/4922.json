No one is ever fooled they aren&#39;t fighting the<br/>\ncomputer.  Really, MOB tactics are very limited, move to target, get weak,<br/>\nmove away.  Cast from distance or use bow from distance.  Fairly simplistic,<br/>\nespecially when fighting many at once.  Monsters will use spells to heal<br/>\neach other, give you that, but they really don&#39;t use the spells they have<br/>\nthat intelligently... thus they are given unlimited mana.  It almost seems<br/>\nMOBs cast what spells they are given at random, to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the AI in the current crop of FPS games these days.  EQ may not be<br/>\nUnreal by any means, yet admit EQ&#39;s AI behaves about like Doom&#39;s did.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have to disagree with you on the AI.
