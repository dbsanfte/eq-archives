The Bard&#39;s offense sucks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I used to think that bardic melee was less than SK/Paladin level due to<br/>\n&gt; the lack of double attack, but now I&#39;m reconsidering.  Our offense caps<br/>\n&gt; are significantly higher than theirs, and I&#39;m looking forward to testing<br/>\n&gt; to determine who&#39;s output is higher.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The problem is &quot;the situation&quot;.  There are 7 things that high-level Kunark<br/>\n&gt; parties need:  1) crowd<br/>\n&gt; &gt; control, 2) primary healer, 3) a tank, 4) a puller, 5) a group gater<br/>\n&gt; (sometimes), 6) a lockpicker<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (sometimes), 7) secondary healer (sometimes).  The bard can&#39;t do any of<br/>\n&gt; these things other than limited<br/>\n&gt; &gt; crowd control, or pulling (which doesn&#39;t allow him to play the downtime<br/>\n&gt; reducing role), which means that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he doesn&#39;t satisfy any of the core requirements.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is a common mistake that many run into.  People see that deep in<br/>\n&gt; dungeons an enchanter, evaccer, and cleric are all required and think<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re always required.  There&#39;s tons of stuff you can do that doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; take any of these.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m often the group&#39;s puller due to a combination of knowledge of the area<br/>\n&gt; and Lament.  When I am, I sing Cantata through battles to help with mana<br/>\n&gt; levels, because in these situations there usually isn&#39;t an enchanter<br/>\n&gt; either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shamans are the best group makers.  There is next to no need for a cleric<br/>\n&gt; with turgur&#39;s.  A shaman friend and I often do the zone-in area to<br/>\n&gt; Charasis, we can hold down 8 spawns before they start returning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And get ready for the best change since Kunark was released: Song of<br/>\n&gt; Twilight works!  I played crowd control/puller for a group of five in the<br/>\n&gt; north wing (bard, war, war, dru, cler), and was able to lock down three<br/>\n&gt; mobs at once during a particularly bad period of respawning of wanderers<br/>\n&gt; that lasted a good six minutes to get under control.  Further testing on a<br/>\n&gt; clearing to Trak&#39;s lair revealed Song of Twilight works on anything an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter can dazzle (ilis, krup, shrooms &lt;56, not jugs).  Charm has hit<br/>\n&gt; the back burner now (I hate having to get hit every 10 seconds to maintain<br/>\n&gt; control), the power is back on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Athren Notechaser, 57th composition in progress<br/>\n&gt; &lt;The Relentless&gt;                    Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
