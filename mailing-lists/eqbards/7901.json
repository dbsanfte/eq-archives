Good faction with the live<br/>\nfrogs will do nothing for you there.  We had two parties<br/>\nheading towards the spot together (10 people total, levels 30<br/>\nto 42) and unfortunately got a train run through us.  It<br/>\npassed completely through us, but we knew it was coming back<br/>\nwhen the people conducting the train either died or zoned, and<br/>\nfrantically started to invis-to-undead everyone.  We didn&#39;t<br/>\nfinish it in time.  One of us got attacked, after which people<br/>\ndropped their invisibility to defend him, and all hell broke<br/>\nloose.  Only 3 of us made it out alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
