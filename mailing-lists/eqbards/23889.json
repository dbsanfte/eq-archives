Verant has<br/>\nactually said that our single target snares breaking early was a bug! Also,<br/>\nDDD was upgraded...but I have honestly only ever loaded DDD once, and doubt<br/>\nI will load it after this fix.<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\nSource: EverQuest Patch Message. <br/>\nToday&#39;s patch contains a wide variety of enhancements and changes. Due to<br/>\nthe number of<br/>\nchanges being made, this list is primarily a summary. Extended descriptions<br/>\nof the changes and<br/>\nthe reasoning behind them can be solicited on the EverQuest Message Boards. <br/>\nSpell and Skill Changes <br/>\nDruids, Shaman, and Clerics: <br/>\nSuperior Healing moved to level 51 for shamans and druids. <br/>\nCasting difficulty of Superior Heal reduced (less fizzles) <br/>\nNew level 55 Druid and shaman spell, Chloroblast, similar to remedy for<br/>\nclerics. <br/>\nNew Druid spell at level 60, upgrade to superior healing, Natures Touch. <br/>\nCreated a new spell effect for Celestial Healing, Celestial Elixir, and<br/>\nTorpor. This will allow<br/>\nthem to stack with all other spells, save spells of the same type (Heal over<br/>\ntime). Prior to<br/>\nthis, all heal-over-time spells followed the same rules as regeneration<br/>\nspells. <br/>\nReduced the casting difficulty of Remedy. <br/>\nLowered recast time on Wake of Karana <br/>\nPaladins: <br/>\nAdded Endure Magic spell at level 30 <br/>\nAdded Resist Magic at 55 <br/>\nMoved Guard spell from 49 to 39 <br/>\nMoved Armor of Faith from 53 to 49 <br/>\nAdded New level 53 paladin spell: Divine Glory <br/>\nAdded New level 59 spell: Celestial Cleansing <br/>\nDefense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <br/>\nAdded Yaulp 4 at 60 and enhanced. <br/>\nShadowknights: <br/>\nRemoved artificially inflated mana cost for pre level 50 lifetap spells.<br/>\nPlease note that<br/>\npost-50 lifetap spells never had an inflated mana cost. <br/>\nMoved Spirit Tap to level 55 <br/>\nMoved Drain Spirit to level 57 <br/>\nAdded Drain Soul at level 60 <br/>\nGrim Aura added at level 22 and enhanced <br/>\nMoved Shieldskin to level 34 <br/>\nPet buff added at 29 <br/>\nAdded Diamondskin spell at 59 <br/>\nDefense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <br/>\nDue to the recent improvements to &quot;Harmtouch&quot;, it is doing much more damage<br/>\nthan it<br/>\nwould before and unbalances PvP. As such it will now do less damage in PvP<br/>\n(68% of<br/>\nPvE, down from 80%). In addition, Shadowknights on the PvP servers were<br/>\nroutinely<br/>\nkilling themselves via non-XP losing means and attacking other players with<br/>\nHarmtouch<br/>\nimmediately upon respawn. In order to address this situation, Harmtouch is<br/>\nno longer<br/>\nautomatically &quot;recharged&quot; by death on the PvP Servers. <br/>\nThe &quot;Lifeleech&quot; discipline now increases hit probability in addition to its<br/>\nother effects. <br/>\nRangers: <br/>\nAdded Endure Cold at 22 <br/>\nAdded Skin Like Nature at 59 <br/>\nAdded FireFist at 22 <br/>\nMoved Bramblecoat from 49 to 39 <br/>\nAdded Spikecoat at 49 <br/>\nAdded resist cold at 55 <br/>\nAdded Panic Animal at 22 <br/>\nMoved Jolt to 51 <br/>\nMoved Spirt of Wolf from 39 to 30 <br/>\nAdded Cinder Jolt (fire-based Jolt spell) at 55. <br/>\nOffense and weapons skill made identical to warriors <br/>\nAdded See Invisible at 39 <br/>\nBards: <br/>\nAdded new level 20 Bard Song: Cassindra`s Chant of Clarity <br/>\nBards defensive skill made exactly the same as a warriors <br/>\nChanged it so that the bard spell Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge to increase damge<br/>\nby 10pts<br/>\nper level over 45. Also made it so the spell does 20% more damage using the<br/>\nPuretone<br/>\ndiscipline. <br/>\nMagicians: <br/>\nAdded new level 59 spell: Valiant Companion <br/>\nAdded new level 39 spell: Summon Companion <br/>\nRain spells no longer count pets against total number of entities they can<br/>\ndamage (all<br/>\nrain spells) <br/>\nAdded level 29 spell for Mages: Expedience <br/>\nEnchanters: <br/>\nLowered recast time on Visions of Grandeur <br/>\nBug Fixes <br/>\nAggressive and Defensive disciplines have been fixed. Before they would only<br/>\naffect<br/>\ndamage taken and not affect damage dealt out. Now they affect both as<br/>\ndesigned. <br/>\nFixed the bug with going to the spellbook when the inventory window was up<br/>\nin fullview<br/>\nmode. It should work now. Also, fixed a minor bug where if you were in<br/>\nnormal mode<br/>\nand tried to go to the spellbook from inventory via /book or the keymapped<br/>\nkey it would<br/>\nnot go, and it would make the done button not work properly for the<br/>\ninventory mode. <br/>\nFixed NPC melee ranges to be the same as for player characters. In other<br/>\nwords, if you<br/>\ncan hit the NPC, he can hit you. This bug was a problem with one dragon that<br/>\ncould be<br/>\nhit, but could not hit back. <br/>\nFixed a bug that made it impossible to &quot;Call of the Hero&quot; someone out of<br/>\nwater or lava. <br/>\nFixed the proc on the Chilled Scythe. Owners of this item will need to swap<br/>\nit out with a<br/>\nGM. <br/>\nThe Kromzek Surveyor Scope now fits in the &quot;Ranged&quot; slot rather than the<br/>\n&quot;Ammo&quot; slot<br/>\nas before. <br/>\nFixed a bug that caused the two single-target bard snare songs to break too<br/>\nsoon in<br/>\nsome cases. <br/>\nFixed a bug whereby NPCs would consider the race of a player prior to the<br/>\nloading of the<br/>\nfaction table upon zoning or logging in. This would cause people to be<br/>\nattacked by<br/>\nthings that normally like them. <br/>\nPlayers should now be properly removed from the group regardless of how they<br/>\nexit the<br/>\ngame. <br/>\nMisc Changes <br/>\nAdded text labels to the fullview inventory window &quot;body&quot; slots (Available<br/>\nonly to Velious<br/>\nSubscribers) <br/>\nAdded the ability to toggle those labels on and off. Use /invwinlabels<br/>\n[on/off] (or no<br/>\narguments to toggle). This is saved in the eqclient.ini file in the<br/>\n[Defaults] section with<br/>\nthe key InvWinLabels=[TRUE/FALSE] <br/>\nIncreased the pre-50 bind-wounds cap for rogues and warriors. <br/>\nPickpocket now works to a max of 5 levels below you, or level 45...whichever<br/>\nis greater...<br/>\nYou can pickpocket NPC up to level 55 if you are level 60. <br/>\nThe mouse pointer will now move at a multiple of its normal speed when you<br/>\nadjust the<br/>\nMousePointerSpeedMod setting in the eqclient.ini file. You can set that<br/>\nmultiple on-the-fly<br/>\nwith the /mousespeed command. <br/>\nThe &quot;AutoHelp&quot; feature that can be set under the options menu has been<br/>\nenhanced.<br/>\nSpell casters in particular might want to turn it on and try depressing the<br/>\nALT key. It&#39;s<br/>\nperfect for refreshing your memory in regards to your spell lineup. <br/>\nIf you are interrupted while trying to cast a spell that uses a component,<br/>\nyou will no<br/>\nlonger use that component. Jewelers should be very pleased with this change.<br/>\n<br/>\nReduced the casting difficulty (fizzle rate) of all spells over level 56.<br/>\nSpells have always<br/>\npreviously been set up so that it&#39;s usually more efficient to use a spell<br/>\nfrom a previous<br/>\ncircle than the current one. The formula did not take into account the fact<br/>\nthat everyone<br/>\nstops at 60. <br/>\nChanged it so that players will now lose experience when they die in the<br/>\nArena in Kael<br/>\nDrakkel. It seems that people were fighting giants in that arena in order to<br/>\navoid the<br/>\ndeath penalty. <br/>\nNaked PC corpses that have experience and are above level 30 will now last 3<br/>\nhours<br/>\ninstead of 3 minutes. <br/>\nAvatar and Focus of Spirit should now stack <br/>\nRaised the pre and post 50 bind wounds cap for paladins, clerics, druids,<br/>\nand shaman. <br/>\nItem Changes <br/>\nThe effect on the &quot;Frost Giant Beard&quot; can now be used at 35th level rather<br/>\nthan level 50.<br/>\nThe Wurmslayer will now fit in a bag. <br/>\nIksar can now use the Ashenbone Shield <br/>\nChandged Crystallized Shadow leggings to rentable <br/>\nChanged Gorilla Hide Leggings to show up as leather, was cloth before <br/>\nChanged Envy from a piercing weapon to a shield so players could Bash with<br/>\nit. Envy is a<br/>\nparrying dagger. <br/>\nThe Shralok Pack is now LORE. It was set to pending-lore some time ago. <br/>\nThe Guardian and Sentry Armor bracers are no longer LORE. <br/>\nDonal&#39;s Breastplate can now only be used on any individual target once every<br/>\n7.5<br/>\nminutes. This addresses some of the balance issues that became apparent<br/>\ngiven the<br/>\nexistence of a mana-free complete heal. <br/>\nTrades and Crafts <br/>\nFixed the Gator Roll baking recipe. <br/>\nRepaired the notetext instructions for creating a Mixing Bowl with pottery.<br/>\nRepaired<br/>\nHolgresh Fur Cap and Holgresh Fur Moccasins tailoring recipes. <br/>\nMade it so that the file is returned in addition to the hammer when a<br/>\ncharacter fails to<br/>\nforge any of the various chain jointings. <br/>\nRepaired Recipe for Enchanted Tier`Dal Adamantite Bracelet <br/>\nMade it so that the Dwarven Smithy Hammer is returned on a failure to forge<br/>\nBrellium<br/>\nChain Jointing. <br/>\nRepaired Field Plate Boots smithing recipe <br/>\nChanged the name of the smithed Enchanted Cabilis Scale armor to Imbued<br/>\nCabilis Scale<br/>\narmor for naming convention reasons. <br/>\nRepaired the recipe for converting 3 Enchanted Large Adamantite Bricks into<br/>\n1<br/>\nEnchanted Block of Adamantite in the Tier`Dal Forge, it was previously only<br/>\npossible in<br/>\nthe Oggok Forge. <br/>\nMade it so that the Bread Tin is returned upon a failure to bake bread. <br/>\nMithril and Velium Bonings will be stackable. <br/>\nMithril Studs will be stackable. <br/>\nNPC AI - Hate <br/>\nWe&#39;ve made a number of changes to NPC AI, specifically to the section<br/>\ndealing with<br/>\ntarget-selection, or what&#39;s commonly referred to as &quot;Hate&quot;. It is not so<br/>\nmuch that NPCs react<br/>\ndifferently to hate now than before, but that we&#39;ve changed the way that<br/>\nhate is awarded. <br/>\nWe reduced the amount of hate that can be caused by a proc. Due to the high<br/>\nproc<br/>\nrates at upper levels, the amount of hate generated from procs, and the<br/>\nspells that<br/>\nwere selected for those procs, made keeping the attention of the creature<br/>\nmuch too<br/>\neasy a task for the tank. Simply, it nearly eliminated the challenge of<br/>\nkeeping a foes<br/>\nattention at levels above 50. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve capped the amount of hate that can be awarded to most casters,<br/>\nspecifically for<br/>\ndebuff-type spells like the Malo and Tash series. The hate calculation for<br/>\nthese spells<br/>\ntakes into account the number of hitpoints of the NPC and did not &quot;play<br/>\nnice&quot; with the<br/>\nincreased HP limit of Velious. It explains why Enchanters, for instance,<br/>\nwould complain<br/>\nthat casting a Tash spell would lead to near-instant death. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve redressed the amount of hate generated by heal spells. Previously, and<br/>\n*partly*<br/>\ndue to a bug, the high level heal spells such as superior heal or complete<br/>\nheal would<br/>\ngenerate no more hate than greater heal. In fact, so little hate was<br/>\ngenerated by these<br/>\nspells that it made controlling NPC aggression trivial. Heal spells will now<br/>\ngenerate an<br/>\namount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed.<br/>\nDue to our<br/>\ndesire to leave the lower level game more or less untouched, two separate<br/>\ncaps have<br/>\nbeen placed for targets level 50 or below, and 51 or above. Heal spells will<br/>\ngenerate<br/>\nsignificantly less hate for targets below level 51 than those at or above<br/>\nthat level. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve also re-evaluated ways that players have to reduce their own hate.<br/>\nWhile spells<br/>\nin place to allow this are OK, the Evade skill (possessed by rogues) let<br/>\nthem out of their<br/>\ndamage too easily. A rogue that successfully evaded would immediately drop<br/>\nto a level<br/>\nof hate lower than someone who was in the awareness range, but hadn&#39;t done<br/>\nanything to really upset the creature such as damage it or heal its foe.<br/>\nThis problem was<br/>\nexacerbated by the increase of the size of the hate list implemented with<br/>\nVelious. <br/>\nTracking <br/>\nTracking now works in full view for all classes that can use it, and sports<br/>\na nifty scroll bar that<br/>\nallows players to see everything on the list. In addition, the /trackplayer<br/>\nsetting is now saved<br/>\nto the eqclient.ini file. <br/>\nThe following options have been put in for Rangers only: <br/>\n/tracksort <br/>\n/trackfilter <br/>\n/tracksort options beginning with R are reverse order <br/>\nHybrid Casting <br/>\nHybrids that cast spells in combat were taking double penalties at higher<br/>\nlevels. The casting<br/>\ntimes of their spells went up, and the amount of melee damage they do per<br/>\nsecond went up.<br/>\nThis results is having to take longer to cast spells, and losing more<br/>\ndamage/second for each<br/>\nsecond taken in casting. <br/>\nTo help offset this, Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights casting<br/>\nnon-beneficial spells that<br/>\nhave casting times greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 %<br/>\nreduction in casting time<br/>\nfor each level over 50. 3% at 51, 6% at 52, etc., to 30% at 60. Again, this<br/>\napplies only to<br/>\nnon-beneficial spells. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
