When we tried to pull the 2<br/>\nfar gargoyles, the buggy pathing would bite us in the ass and the negotiator<br/>\nroom would come to investigate what all the ruckus was. (leading to a prompt<br/>\nevac)<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you have any tips on the harmoing of the gargs / negotiator / ball<br/>\nroom ? We tried to break the ball room a couple of times, but to no avail.<br/>\nWe all lined up in the south east corner of the room while invis, we let<br/>\ninvis drop which would pull the 2 mobs at the doors. Problem was about<br/>\nhalfway through the fight the gypsys would agro and jump on board. After 4<br/>\nattempts we called it a night.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince that time I was lucky enough to catch Mynthi sitting at the zone all<br/>\nalone. (I soloed her to earn my drums) And a pair of level 50s camping the<br/>\nball room let our warrior loot a talon so he got his BP. That sort of<br/>\neliminated our need to go to the ball room so we haven&#39;t returned. (Although<br/>\nI would love to pick up a second lute so I have a NO DROP one for switching)<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 17, 2000 4:24 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Back on the topic of the dreaded EBW<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 17 Apr 2000, Adam Wasserman wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;ve camped and I&#39;ve camped and I have yet to be rewarded for my<br/>\nefforts<br/>\n&gt; with even a single fang.
