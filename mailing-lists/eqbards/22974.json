For this reason alone, bards were the<br/>\nbest class for pulling in PoG.  Now if you get rooted, your stuck in place<br/>\nuntil roots wears off or until you cancel magic it away.  This change is<br/>\ncontrary to what GZ stated a long time ago on how the song was intended to<br/>\nwork.

The<br/>\npatch went in, there was a public outcry, and a few days later the decision<br/>\nwas reversed and Selos was working the way it did when the game was first<br/>\nreleased, i.e. it broke root. Geoffrey Zatkin at one point even publically<br/>\nstated that Selos breaking root was &quot;working as intended&quot; and not a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else remember that far back?  I&#39;d also like to know where we can<br/>\nfind GZ&#39;s statement (if it is still archived somewhere).<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW who wants to bet with me that the reason Selos got nerfed (not referring<br/>\nto the drum bug) is because Verant discovered uberguilds were using bards to<br/>\nsafely pull in the PoG?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
