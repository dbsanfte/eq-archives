For each song, it<br/>\nlists all the songs that a) it overwrites, b) are overwritten by it, and<br/>\nc) mutually block each other.  There are also charts at the end which<br/>\nshow the rules for the two major song groups (attack and defense).  This<br/>\nis useful for me just building a single song list, but is even more<br/>\nuseful if you&#39;re stuck working with another Bard.  I&#39;m not reposting it<br/>\nhere because it&#39;s pretty long and it doesn&#39;t format well on this board,<br/>\nbut if you would like to check it out, see the thread:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=8358.topic\">http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=8358.topic</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;d like to note even if you don&#39;t want to look is that Melody<br/>\nof Ervaj (level 50 stackable haste) overwrites most of our resist<br/>\nsongs.  They can&#39;t be sung if MoE is up, and MoE will just replace the<br/>\nicon.  Just an FYI.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
