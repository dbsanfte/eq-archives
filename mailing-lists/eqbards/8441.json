He then got my group started in on it (I was the group <br/>\n&gt;leader)<br/>\n&gt;and everyone was against me claiming I should sing the song and that it<br/>\n&gt;works especially well for manna regen when using the Mistmoore drum (which <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;do not have by the way).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I tried to explain the myth to them but no one wanted to hear about it and<br/>\n&gt;this guy just kept saying he &quot;hates to see someone play the character class<br/>\n&gt;so poorly&quot;.  Well I got totally ticked off and lost my temper and started<br/>\n&gt;cussing like crazy at him (in private tell) to which he responded he would<br/>\n&gt;get his bard character and meet me and kick my A** all over highkeep, to<br/>\n&gt;which I brilliantly responded &quot;kiss my a** you stupid fu**er&quot; (I know, real<br/>\n&gt;intelligent).  He said he was going to tell two of my party members <br/>\n&gt;(friends<br/>\n&gt;of his) to leave my group so I decided forget this (was now shaking in rage<br/>\n&gt;and very insulted by this guy) so I disbanded my group, apologized to the<br/>\n&gt;nice people in it, and logged out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wish I could remember this guy&#39;s name so I could post it here but as I<br/>\n&gt;said I was seeing red at the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My point is that there are tons of lies and falsehoods about our abilities<br/>\n&gt;that trolls and generally uninformed people love to spread for some reason<br/>\n&gt;or another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Faras<br/>\n&gt;  E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes it seems unlikely, and I do not completely trust the guy who broadcast <br/>\nthis over guildchat. However, your situation is a little different because <br/>\nthere is no hard number to look at while testing Jig vs Mana Regen, and <br/>\nsometimes mana status bars can appear slower or faster due to lag of one <br/>\nkind or another. This guy is claiming an exact number of hp healed by Hymn + <br/>\nGypsy Lute (45 at 46th level), and I won&#39;t bother to slam him for false info <br/>\nuntil I know wether or not it&#39;s true.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I do recall a post by J.M.
