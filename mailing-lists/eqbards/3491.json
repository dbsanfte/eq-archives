Quite frequently at off hours (400-700 people online)<br/>\nI&#39;ll be running back to my group after selling loot (as my other char,<br/>\na druid) and cross through several zones with people repeatedly asking for<br/>\nbinds and not getting any responses. Sometimes I&#39;ll return an hour later<br/>\nif the loot has been plentiful (heavy) and I&#39;ll hear them still shout&#39;ing<br/>\nfor a bind. In that situation I&#39;ll spot and bind them, even though most of<br/>\nthe time my group needs me back ASAP (I go because I&#39;m the fastest).<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention, I have a number of lower level friends who I have to give<br/>\ngroup teleports semi-regularly (every night or two) because they died and<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t able to get bound. If someone has to spend half an hour,<br/>\nputting their fun and adventuring on hold, just to PAY someone to bind<br/>\nthem, then something is very very wrong in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is still a strong balancing factor.
