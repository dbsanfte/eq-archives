The poster stated that we had different ways to<br/>\nhandle the mobs, outside of AC, and then used an Enchanter as an example.  I<br/>\nwas pointing out that the Enchanter has the tools necessary that mitigate<br/>\nthe need for AC under these particular circumstances.  We have been able to<br/>\nwear steel class armor for this reason since at least release; the game<br/>\nmechanics have not changed in regards to the bard getting jumped in a<br/>\nmulti-mob scenario.<br/>\n6) Rune.<br/>\n7) At my level, the only time the enchanter can&#39;t outrun the outdoors mob is<br/>\nif there is no druid, ranger, or shaman in the group, or the mob can keep<br/>\npace with SoW.  If they want it, it&#39;s rather easy for an enchanter at my<br/>\nlevel to have JBoots, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
