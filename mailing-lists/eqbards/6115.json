Its so depressing, this whole<br/>\nlevel i&#39;ve made enough money to buy full steel plate by killing giants, even<br/>\ngot a box of aku-bar.  While i had almost caught up to most of my group when<br/>\ni hit 30, they&#39;ve all jumped ahead and are now all 37-40.  If im lucky i<br/>\nmight level tonight or tomorrow and get out of my first hell level.  I even<br/>\nmade a few low lev chars to change my train of thoughts to get away from the<br/>\ndepressing feeling of 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin Nehoc<br/>\nForever 30<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tAbraham Hardjana [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSeptember 3, 1999 12:05 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Bard Superstitions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 3 Sep 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 25 is a mini-hell.

I dinna want it to be so.  THough I think it is<br/>\n&gt; noticable in Unrest since the mobs are mostly blue to me now.  Perhaps 25<br/>\n&gt; is one of those inbetween levels where most things are green or even =(.<br/>\n&gt; Time to check Mistmoore then.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 31 you lose about a bubble per death (vs. about 1/4-1/3 at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 30 and 32).  If you tend to have a high number of deaths per<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level as I know many of you do, this can really screw you up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Whereas before you were taking 5 steps forward and 2 steps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back for a net gain of 3 steps a night, at 31 this can turn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into 5 steps forward and 6 steps back for a net loss of 1 step<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a night, even though you are gaining experience and dying at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the exact same rate as before.  I hear this holds true for all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hell-levels + 1.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ack, now I am getting depressed my friend.  I was so happy to have cleared<br/>\n&gt; leel 24 with only one death.  As my friends know well I am way to big on<br/>\n&gt; the honour and chivalry bit and hence forth I die way too often<br/>\n&gt; helping/saving friends.  Oh well I guess I will be one of those  bards who<br/>\n&gt; will congratulated 20-30 times for getting my level 30 =).  Anyone know a <br/>\n&gt; pretty cleric who would be willing to marry a bard who is proone to dying<br/>\n&gt; and causing trains?  ... ANy takers?...
