I was not using it to<br/>\nmezmerize something for a long period of time, its common other usage, so it may in fact be<br/>\nbroken in that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is definately stunning long enough to disrupt caster mobs though, an essential use if you&#39;re<br/>\ncamping Solusek Mages for their booties.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
