Here was Gordon&#39;s response.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While I&#39;ll leave in-depth determination of &quot;role&quot; to those <br/>\n&gt; playing it, I<br/>\n&gt; think that you&#39;ve answered your own question here. Bards are <br/>\n&gt; good at so many<br/>\n&gt; things, you&#39;re surely here to do some of those things. I feel <br/>\n&gt; that Bards<br/>\n&gt; excell at making a good group better. That&#39;s my opinion. What&#39;s more<br/>\n&gt; important though is, what is a bard&#39;s role to you? If you <br/>\n&gt; look at it as a<br/>\n&gt; walking-talking mana battery, there&#39;s not really much I can <br/>\n&gt; do to make you<br/>\n&gt; feel better about it. It&#39;s the same issues with the clerics who often<br/>\n&gt; complain that they are a walking-talking hitpoint-battery. <br/>\n&gt; You are a support<br/>\n&gt; class. You support the group, and you do it very well. <br/>\n&gt; Whether or not you<br/>\n&gt; are happy with that role is up to you. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Gordon <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pretty pathetic in my opinion.  Obviously Gordon just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a huge difference between the satisfaction one gets <br/>\n&gt; from saving a<br/>\n&gt; comrade&#39;s life (virtual or not) and the satisfaction of <br/>\n&gt; knowing that the<br/>\n&gt; druid can get off one more Careless Lightning because you <br/>\n&gt; stood around and<br/>\n&gt; played mana battery.  What a joke.  Obviously in VI&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Vision&quot; bards are not<br/>\n&gt; meant to be real characters.  Our role is solely to support <br/>\n&gt; other&#39;s efforts.<br/>\n&gt; They should have called the class &quot;Sidekick&quot; instead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
