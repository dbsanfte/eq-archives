Did you mean Lullaby?  I&#39;d never try<br/>\nthat as it gets resisted 60%+ on yellows and up and it would break any<br/>\nmezzed critters that didn&#39;t resist in 6 seconds.  I use Siren&#39;s if I need to<br/>\nget something off the Enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy weapon damage is laughable.  Even with a Harpoon of the Depths and an<br/>\nObsidian Shard, with the low taunt songs I&#39;m twisting, a ranger 5 levels<br/>\nbelow me got the mobs attention twice as much as I did.  The only times I<br/>\nwas the target of choice was when I pulled or had to charm a mob off<br/>\nsomeone.  Even with our high taunt factor, the songs I was singing weren&#39;t<br/>\neffective enough to warrant more attention from the mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure when I have manasong I&#39;ll have another option for twisting but<br/>\nwithout being able to use my hard hitting songs I won&#39;t be an offensive<br/>\nforce when the &#39;chanter is around until I have three Chants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not in my nature to be solely a defensive presence, and I&#39;m not sure I<br/>\nhave the tools to do that job anyhow except vs. casters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are good defensive tools against melee mobs?  The Damage shields seem<br/>\nweak considering we are fighting 1 mob 90% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapons:<br/>\nI put away the Blade of Fiery Lamentations and break out the  Staff of<br/>\nWrithing, with the Obsidian Shard I am now AE free on weapons and still<br/>\nkicking butt.<br/>\n<br/>\nSongs:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn combat (assuming the Enchanter knows their job and keeps the haste buffs<br/>\ncoming) I sing Psalm of Cooling, Clarity and Chant of Battle in combat. I<br/>\nhave Lament ready in case the Enchanter mezzes a large pull, I do this<br/>\nbecause if I don&#39;t and the mezz breaks the mobs are all over him/her. Lament<br/>\ngives the enchanter a chance the mobs will agro on me, and I can survive<br/>\nthat better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have Resist buffs and pixie strike ready for an unplanned caster-mob<br/>\nemergency.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the enchanter gets the casters mezzed I switch to horn and play Dennons<br/>\nDissention to drain them while they wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of ways to play nice with an enchanter, frankly I love<br/>\ngrouping with them. And any other casters love it too, Clarity and Clarity<br/>\nsong is a beautiful thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n<br/>\n(Hymn is the other song of course. There are some changes for outdoor as I<br/>\nneed selos, however, if there is a Shaman I just get a SoW and use the slot<br/>\nfor something else)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
