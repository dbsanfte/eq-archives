I, however, never had the time to<br/>\ngo sit in Lower Guk and wait for a drop. (not to mention I didn&#39;t exactly<br/>\nknow where the room was)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, now the story is a little different. I expect to make 32 tonight, and<br/>\nwith it to be accepted whole heartedly into any group. :┬¼ )  Ok, maybe not,<br/>\nbut it should help and make me a little more valuable to a high level group<br/>\nthan I was before. That being said, most of the people I spoke to said the<br/>\nghoul assassin is mid 30s in level, so I was thinking of going to earn my<br/>\nmask the old fashioned way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here are my humble questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I can get to the bedroom (who can&#39;t) but I don&#39;t know the exact way to<br/>\nthe assassin&#39;s room. How do I get to the room? I have several maps, but they<br/>\nare all a bit sketchy in the assasin area, and I&#39;ve heard there are ladders<br/>\ninvolved.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Does anyone know what level group usually camps the room, or what the<br/>\ncommon loot practices are? (eg. if I go for the mask, will I be excluded<br/>\nfrom the other loot since I can use the mask, or is it not even counted<br/>\nsince it&#39;s no drop) It&#39;s not that I care, I&#39;ll go either way, I&#39;m just<br/>\ncurious.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Is there anything in particular I need to watch out for?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nthe Tribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
