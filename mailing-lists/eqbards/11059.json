It really looks like either they don&#39;t have someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;at Verant who &quot;owns&quot; bards, both from a programming and testing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;standpoint, or if they do, it&#39;s someone who is incompetent or doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;care.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Actually I&#39;d say this is the case regarding testing in general, not just<br/>\n&gt; bard testing.  Its merely more amplified since no one plays bards regularly<br/>\n&gt; on the team.  I have seen zero evidence they ever test anything, and much<br/>\n&gt; evidence to the contrary.  They seem to have the typical old school (and I<br/>\n&gt; mean really old, like 25+ years ago) mentality of, &quot;Hey it compiled ok.<br/>\n&gt; Testing complete.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the developers totally at fault on this one either.<br/>\nUnfortunately, I think once the game went live, the accountants took<br/>\nover and I strongly suspect that the development group is on a very low<br/>\nmaintenance budget now. The speed at which changes are made, and the<br/>\nproblems they seem to have even understanding the code they are changing<br/>\nreally seems to point to them having very few people working on<br/>\nmaintenance, and, lower quality programmers than the people who actually<br/>\nwrote the game to begin with. If they still had the original development<br/>\nteam, I&#39;d say at the rate and reliability they are currently fixing<br/>\nproblems, they never would have shipped the game even after 4 years in<br/>\ndevelopment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne glaring example is the simple addition of the optional download<br/>\nquery they added to the client.
