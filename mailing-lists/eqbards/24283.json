Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 06, 2001 11:58 AM<br/>\nTo: EQ Bards<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Path Message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Patch Day***<br/>\n<br/>\n*General Changes*<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Doubled the chance gain skill points in skills that are above 200.<br/>\n-- Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal&#39;s Breatplate on others<br/>\nonce casted upon yourself.<br/>\n-- The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by SKs<br/>\n-- Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via /book<br/>\nor alt+b.<br/>\n-- Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.<br/>\n-- New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One on<br/>\nAntonica and two others on Kunark.  NPCs at these locations can fill you in<br/>\non the details.  Good hunting.<br/>\n-- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the &quot;Celestial<br/>\nHealing&quot; effect has been increased to one minute.  We understand that this<br/>\nseverely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing<br/>\nalternate effects to place on those items in the next patch.  We did,<br/>\nhowever, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and<br/>\nkept on the group tank.  When we&#39;ve decided on the new affect, it will be<br/>\napplied to those items retroactively.<br/>\n-- Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for skill<br/>\nvalues over 100.  Values under 100 still show the qualitative identifiers.<br/>\n-- Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other<br/>\nplayers.  You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other players<br/>\nby typing /inspect.<br/>\n-- Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over the<br/>\nchat window.<br/>\n-- Fixed &quot;Breath of the Sea&quot;. It was mistakenly set to be unresistable.<br/>\n-- Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone.<br/>\nThis is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists<br/>\nand clean up your pet.<br/>\n-- &quot;Voice Graft&quot; will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) of your<br/>\npet.<br/>\n-- You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged.<br/>\n-- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125.  It was the<br/>\nintent for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however before<br/>\nthe scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better.  With<br/>\nthe tracking improvements from the last patch, this increase was<br/>\nappropriate.<br/>\n-- Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing.<br/>\n<br/>\n*NPC AI Adjustments*<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Level 60 players with the taunt skill will now have a chance to taunt<br/>\ncreatures that are level 60 to 65.  Previously, players could only taunt<br/>\ncreatures below their level.<br/>\n-- NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount<br/>\nof hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their enemies.  Prior to<br/>\nthis, they would add full hate when they saw you do this.  This is why NPCs<br/>\nwould always jump the cleric after breaking Mez.<br/>\n-- Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much &quot;temporary hate&quot; when a<br/>\nplayer would sit down in front of them.<br/>\n-- The maximum amount of &quot;hate&quot; that an NPC can add when witnessing a heal<br/>\nto targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.<br/>\n-- Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the number<br/>\nof hitpoints healed.  Previously, healing one hitpoint would cause one point<br/>\nof hate.  Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points of hate.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Velious Music*<br/>\n<br/>\nVelious subscribers should run the Velious Patch to pick up new mood music<br/>\nfor some Velious Zones.  Let us know what you think of the new compositions.<br/>\n<br/>\n*EQGems*<br/>\n<br/>\nA new &quot;mini-game&quot; has been added to the EverQuest client.  EQGems is our<br/>\nfirst effort aimed towards allowing people to engage in different activities<br/>\nwhile playing EverQuest.  Based upon the success of EQGems, we may explore<br/>\nopportunities for other mini-games in the future, even some that are<br/>\nmultiplayer in and of themselves.
