I think it&#39;s being honest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not really.  Just because not everyone choose to play the class doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;prove that not everyone can play the class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It is arrogant to assume that everyone who chooses not to play pro baseball<br/>\n&gt;does so because they cannot.  Undoubtedly there are many who could, but<br/>\n&gt;instead play pro football, basketball, soccer, etc.  There are far more<br/>\n&gt;reasons as well.  It was amusing you chose this analogy to me.  I probably<br/>\n&gt;could have played pro baseball, in high school I could already throw an 85<br/>\n&gt;mph fastball.  In my senior year I quit playing though because I found<br/>\n&gt;baseball boring.  Too much standing around, and not enough brain usage.<br/>\n&gt;True I probably could have made millions, if I didn&#39;t blow my arm out<br/>\n&gt;trying, if the pressure didn&#39;t overwhelm me, if...  You get the picture.<br/>\n&gt;The number of baseball players, or football players, or musicians, or<br/>\n&gt;actors, who make millions a year is roughly the same proportion to those<br/>\n </span></blockquote>who<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;try as the number of lottery winners is to those who play.
