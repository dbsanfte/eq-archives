If I had my way, many items would be made<br/>\nmuch more rare than they are, to the extent that no one would camp for them.<br/>\nPeople would then do the dungeons, and if they got something cool it would<br/>\nbe a real reward.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, we&#39;re not going to force you to camp. However if you insist on camping,<br/>\nthen you&#39;ll need to deal with others who insist on camping in a civilized<br/>\nmanner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese rules change nothing for people who already work well with others. For<br/>\ninstance, lets say you are camping something that always has a list going.<br/>\nIf someone new comes in, putting them on the list is perfectly acceptable,<br/>\nmuch the same as you did before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese rules don&#39;t let them come in and demand that they get the next loot,<br/>\nthey only say that you need to work something out, or a GM/Guide will work<br/>\nit out for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Illian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 16, 2000 9:11 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Worldly Issues & &quot;Play Nice&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Interestingly enough, much of the Prexus community as a whole has chosen<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; ignore the new &quot;Play Nice&quot; rules and continue with what has worked for our<br/>\n&gt; server up to this point.  Most high level people and guilds want to<br/>\ncontinue<br/>\n&gt; with the &quot;group list&quot; concept in order to manage the number of players at<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; particular spawn point.  Additionally, they are talking about letting<br/>\n&quot;high<br/>\n&gt; level politics&quot; take care of themselves when it comes to the &quot;whiners&quot;...<br/>\n&gt; Those people simply would get left out of the larger undertakings such as<br/>\n&gt; dragon raids and plane incursions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Will this work?  Depends on how many whiners out there force Verant to<br/>\ntake<br/>\n&gt; action.  I&#39;ve got a feeling that the moment another party shows up in the<br/>\n&gt; Lords room in Lower Guk after the spawn has been broken and demands to<br/>\nshare<br/>\n&gt; the spawn and Verant enforces their policies you will see a TON of people<br/>\n&gt; quit the game outright...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For me, this &quot;Play Nice&quot; policy is a GREAT reason to keep my Asheron&#39;s<br/>\nCall<br/>\n&gt; account active and ready for me to move back to...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Taneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 43rd Song<br/>\n&gt; Prexus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Play Nice is doomed to fail.  The number of issues that will come up for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resolution is so much greater than the resources that Verant has<br/>\nallocated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to handling them (ie not enough Guides to handle all of the whiners that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will surface.)  Verant should have stuck to the mechanics of computers<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gives them power: program code.  If a program lets the user do<br/>\nsomething,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some user (or many users) will do that thing. If Verant wanted to stop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; KS&#39;ing, they should have done it in code.  That way they stop each and<br/>\n&gt; every<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instance and rules get applied to everyone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
