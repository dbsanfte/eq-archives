He gets mad about some<br/>\n&gt;disagreement in the group.  The next time your group camps in some<br/>\n&gt;dangerous area, he binds everyone to that spot.  He then leaves.  The<br/>\n&gt;moment anyone dies, they&#39;ll find themselves in the middle of an orc<br/>\n&gt;camp!  Infinite Please Loading ...  And they have to pay another<br/>\n&gt;spellcaster to get bind in another spot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As it is, it&#39;s livable.  You just have to find a spellcaster to bind<br/>\n&gt;you, and it seems there are plenty of city-zones nearby.  It also<br/>\n&gt;forces players to be more careful with where they hunt, and how they<br/>\n&gt;explore dungeons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would still like to have a solution to all the downtime we spend<br/>\n&gt;running through zones just to get our corpses.
