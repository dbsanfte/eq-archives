I was thinking about<br/>\nincluding a condensed version of it in my post I intend to write as part of<br/>\nthe &quot;ArchMage answers everything bards want to know&quot; thread on the official<br/>\nEQ board.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to any of the EQ spoiler sites and look at all the piercing<br/>\nweapons in the game, you&#39;ll see that a lot of them are Rogue only.  Now I&#39;m<br/>\na firm believer that every class should have weapons that only they can<br/>\nwield, but it seems to me there are a disproportionate number of rogue only<br/>\npiercing weapons in the game compared to the actual number of people who<br/>\nplay rogues.  Lets also take into account how many classes actually use<br/>\npiercing weapons.  Other than rogues, bards are about the only other class<br/>\nin the game that equip piercing weapons on a regular basis.  A ranger here<br/>\nand there may use them but most rangers I see use 1HS weapons.  You almost<br/>\nnever any other class using them.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like to see is either: 1) some of the rogue only piercing items<br/>\nchanged to where bards can equip them or 2) more piercing weapons<br/>\n(appropriate for 25-35 level characters) added to the game that a bard can<br/>\nequip.  The counter argument is that bards have a wide variety of 1HS, 1HB<br/>\nand piercing weapons already in the game that they can use.  True.  But<br/>\nsince bards and rogues traditionally resemble one another, IMO it only makes<br/>\nsense that we can both use the same weapons.  Also, a lot of bards,<br/>\nespecially those who are wood elves, have a very low Stamina stat.  As a<br/>\nresult, I prefer to wield light weapons with fast Delay rates to avoid the<br/>\nstamina drain.  Most piercing weapons fall into this category.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAm I smoking crack here thinking there aren&#39;t enough medium level piercing<br/>\nweapons in the game for bards to use?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci (still wielding a dragoon dirk since around 10th level)<br/>\n30 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  You can do a /who all bard count, /who all rogue count, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get numbers for all the non-anonymous players on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server.  The bard, rogue, and shadowknight have consistently<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yielded the lowest numbers on the two servers I play on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
