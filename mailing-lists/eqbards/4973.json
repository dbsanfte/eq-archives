It seems to be particularly important against the<br/>\nhags DD spells, lightning and Shock of Force. Her primary AoE is the Frost Spiral<br/>\nof Al&#39;kabor. How do I know? Because I usually get the resist message for force<br/>\nshock, and occassionally get it for Frost Spiral. I also think the chance of<br/>\nresisting is weighed against either your level or your defense skill, because<br/>\nanyone who has been to Unrest at level 20 and tangled with a hag died in 2-3<br/>\nspells, while a L30 takes quite a beating before dying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
