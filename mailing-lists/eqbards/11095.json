It&#39;s effect is fire-based (obviously) and you are <br/>\nin a dungeon full of fire goblins... geez.<br/>\nOn non-fire based critters it&#39;s effect is resisted about the same as any <br/>\nother proc in the game. My yaks are resisted just as much as my shard was <br/>\neasily. I certainly hope no one thinks it is an uber-poker, though it is not <br/>\nbad for a non-rogue to use as a piercer.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Quellious of the 50th Chorus<br/>\n-Stace Stormraven<br/>\nDruid of Tunare of the 26th Circle<br/>\n        Veeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Michal Hobson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] trade question<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 2 Dec 1999 12:05:51 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your info is quite correct.  I got lucky and got the predator to drop the<br/>\n&gt;shard a few weeks ago.  I used it for 2 nights and now its collecting dust<br/>\n&gt;in the bank.  Its not only resisted a lot, forget about using it in Sol A,<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s resisted damn near every time.  I am rather surprised about the <br/>\n&gt;stamina<br/>\n&gt;problems that the initial poster of this thread mentioned.  The scimi/dirk<br/>\n&gt;combo is the same setup I use, and I have yet to see my stamina drop more<br/>\n&gt;than a bubble.  In fact, I often drop my dirk in my ranged slot and dual<br/>\n&gt;wield 2 OS&#39;s with very similar results stamina wise.  Maybe its the group<br/>\n&gt;makeup I have, I imagine if you run in a caster heavy group, you would have<br/>\n&gt;that problem when mana runs low.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, just to correct a post someone made yesterday or the day before:<br/>\n&gt;The Obsidian Scimitar has no proc but is + 6 AGI or DEX (I forget which)<br/>\n&gt;The Obsidian Shard has the proc - which is resisted WAY too much in my<br/>\n&gt;opinion, so if you get one, don&#39;t expect it to become the uber-poker you<br/>\n&gt;thought it could be hehe.  I personally was very disappointed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Weiland<br/>\n&gt;&lt;Disciples of Truth&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Erollisi Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
