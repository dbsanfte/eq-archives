I was measuring a 31<br/>\ndeath applied entirely to 30.  I lost more than twice as much<br/>\nexperience in 30 when that happened than I did from a death in<br/>\n30.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing your example, I was in 30, died, and lost a quarter<br/>\nbubble (500 points).  I dinged into 31, then without gaining<br/>\nany experience in the level I died again.  This time I lost<br/>\nmore than half a bubble (1000+ points).  Therefore, you lose<br/>\nmore experience in 31 than you do in 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with 47.  I measured a 47 death applied entirely to<br/>\n46.  I lost less than half what I would&#39;ve expected if I&#39;d<br/>\ndied in 46.  Therefore you lose less experience in 47 than you<br/>\ndo in 46.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not a graphical effect - you really do lose more<br/>\nexperience in HL+1.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
