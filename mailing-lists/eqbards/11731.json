It didn&#39;t take long in the zone auctioning and &quot;tell&quot;<br/>\nto high levels to hear that old refrain &quot;Why sure honey, we just<br/>\ndestroyed (insert number) of the things because no Bard was around. You<br/>\ncome and get the next one.&quot; Moon figures she better know the way so<br/>\nwhips out here lute, through the tunnel, up the ramp and into the<br/>\ncastle. After a short trip, there is the piano room. No problem. On the<br/>\nway back, suddenly &quot;You dare challenge the Might of Mistmoor...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;loading.....&quot; Now to make a long story short Moon WAS able to drag her<br/>\nbody from BETWEEN the LEGS OF A WILL SAPPER&quot; while invis&#39;d. Hands<br/>\nshaking she put her stuff in the bank and 3 days later some high levels<br/>\nkilled a musician at the zone of all places and she got her lute. My<br/>\nbest guess is that LAG was the culprit in invisibility failing the first<br/>\ntime but I can&#39;t rule out the Will Sapper being buffed to see<br/>\ninvisibility one time and not the second.<br/>\n   Bad zone ..yes, but for me the scariest is lower Guk. That<br/>\n&quot;invisibility&quot; to the dead spell goes down at the darndest times... Moon<br/>\ndied 3 times yesterday just getting to the executioners room there. Give<br/>\nme a song any day !!! and I want an Invis to Undead song now !!!!!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n   Moonflower Bllue, Bard of the 32nd Song<br/>\n   Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
