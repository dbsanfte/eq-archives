Heh, 9<br/>\nred to 50 mobs go agro... we&#39;ll see how it turns out.  My one other trip<br/>\nthere involved killing the fairies on the first island.  There&#39;s a lot of<br/>\ncrazy loots and some of them are mentioned in the bard quests.  Has anyone<br/>\ndone any of the quests?  I presume that you kill stuff, loot for your quest<br/>\nitems and then somehow make your way back to the first island and then the<br/>\nquest temple to turn in the items.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone ever do any PoA quests?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
