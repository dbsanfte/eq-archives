But suffice to say I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nsome of the pseudo code that they have thrown around.  It&#39;s not that they&#39;re<br/>\nbad coders.  It&#39;s that they&#39;re good coders who are under far too much<br/>\ntime-pressure.  I don&#39;t care how good you are, if you have a 24 hour project<br/>\nand are forced to kick it out the door in 5 hours there are going to be bad<br/>\nmistakes, or errors in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *know* some of the people involved in developing the pseudo code for the<br/>\npatches that go in.  The pseudocode is good but it makes some broad<br/>\nassumptions without having tested certain aspects.  IE:  Aggroing by<br/>\naccident etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the _programmers_ fault.  Hell, I used to be one myself, and even<br/>\nthe fabulous Brian Hook has made mistakes from time to time ;)  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsaying they are bad.  I&#39;m saying they&#39;re under way too much pressure which<br/>\nresults in collosal errors.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig example:  Everyone in Beta said that EQ was NOT ready for final in March<br/>\nwhen they went to release.  Everyone.  Sony and Verant did so anyway.  Even<br/>\nthe programmers (the few I knew anyway) said there were still a lot of<br/>\nthings they didn&#39;t feel were &#39;finished&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Wasserman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 24, 2000 3:54 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Levels after hell levels<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Adam Wasserman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; right on!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; the programmers always get blamed. I can tell you as a matter of fact that<br/>\n&gt; most of the poor practices implemented in my code are not of my own<br/>\nvolition<br/>\n&gt; but rather because I was told by a producer &quot;do it this way, that&#39;s what<br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt; and so decided&quot;. At that point, I find that the producer generally has<br/>\n&gt; complete resistance to logic or perssuation and the issue is promptly<br/>\n&gt; closed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Blame the designers or the middle men that approve the designer&#39;s<br/>\ndecisions,<br/>\n&gt; but don&#39;t turn on the poor lowly programmers, it&#39;s probably not thier<br/>\ndoing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Draelon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.langlois@...\">mike.langlois@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.langlois@...\">mike.langlois@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 24, 2000 3:45 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Levels after hell levels<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.langlois@...\">mike.langlois@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen this stated a bunch...you&#39;ve never seen the code, correct?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree that the interface interaction is incredibly Diku-like, but I<br/>\n&gt; imagine<br/>\n&gt; this is similar to Bioware using the D&D game architecture, not the old<br/>\nGold<br/>\n&gt; Box<br/>\n&gt; code.<br/>\n&gt; The game design is obviously based on Diku muds, but the code probably<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; After all, even adapting a Diku code base for a game like EQ would make it<br/>\n&gt; pretty unrecognizable, IMHO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a monstrous package, but the amount of real game stopping bugs is<br/>\nvery<br/>\n&gt; minimal.  Mostly we get trivial bugs that reflect poorly thought out<br/>\n&gt; logistics,<br/>\n&gt; not code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heck, even Brian Hook said that they&#39;re a a talented bunch of programmers,<br/>\n&gt; and I<br/>\n&gt; doubt you&#39;re unimpressed with his work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t mean this to be harsh, I just wonder what causes us to<br/>\nblame<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; coders rather than the designers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Um, and that sign reversal thing does suck, btw.  You have a point there,<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve done stupid things like that in my code before, and I bet you have,<br/>\ntoo<br/>\n&gt; :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my .02<br/>\n&gt; Golias, Sol Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ===============<br/>\n&gt; Which means that A) They&#39;ve tinkered with the original Diku experience<br/>\n&gt; tables (NEEDED!) and B) The Hell levels and the H+1 levels are either<br/>\n&gt; extremely intentional or some collosolly bad coding.  I&#39;d personally<br/>\nsupport<br/>\n&gt; either opinion equally.
