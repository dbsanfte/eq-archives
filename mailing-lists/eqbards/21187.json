It would only happen once in a while, however, so it <br/>\nwas not that big of a deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night however, we were doing a practice Kaesora raid with mostly guild <br/>\nmembers, and EVERY time I switched from full screen to windowed, my chat <br/>\nhistory text would dissapear.  Someone in my group mentioned that he only <br/>\nnoticed that problem when grouped with a bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;ll post this same message on Verant&#39;s official message board, not <br/>\nthat they&#39;ll notice it, but at least it&#39;ll be there.. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 42 Missed Notes<br/>\nCrimson Legacy, E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Thu, 31 Aug 2000 16:15:00 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: Khelan&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:khelan@...\">khelan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: eqclient.ini tweaks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve tweaked mine out to where I&#39;m very comfortable with it.

It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;hard to read some of the text in windowed mode, but the text that you have <br/>\n&gt;to read in that mode is black (Merchant buy/sells).  I&#39;ve found that in the <br/>\n&gt;zones that are lighter or foggy zones (like Burning Woods sometimes), all <br/>\n&gt;you have to do to read the text again is toggle on the Transparent Polys (~ <br/>\n&gt;key).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d like to know what some of you all think (and if you have color <br/>\n&gt;suggestions, please tell me).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;BTW, anyone else notice their text disappearing when changing from windowed <br/>\n&gt;to full-screen mode and vice versa?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Enjoy!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--Khelan Stormblood, Bard of 35 songs<br/>\n&gt;GuildMaster Temporal Crusaders, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
