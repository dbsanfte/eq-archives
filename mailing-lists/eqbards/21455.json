Adagia.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSeptember 19th, 7:00am<br/>\n------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n*Level 1 Character Purge*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take <br/>\nplace on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7).  Any <br/>\nlevel 1 characters that haven&#39;t been played within the previous 30 <br/>\ndays will be deleted.  If you wish to keep any level 1 characters <br/>\nthat you may have, please log in and play them between now and 9/27.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Patch Day***<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more <br/>\ncontent for EverQuest players, today&#39;s patch primarily consists of <br/>\n*many* content-additions to the game.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*New Epic Quests*<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are pleased to announce that we have implemented new &quot;Fiery <br/>\nAvenger&quot; style quests for every class in the game (including <br/>\npaladins).  The ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model <br/>\nwith unique particle effects. We think that you will be pleased.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to everyone on your quest.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Class Issues*<br/>\n<br/>\nRangers:<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills <br/>\nfor all melee-centric classes.  In the course of these tests we <br/>\ndetermined that the ranger class was not performing to its intended <br/>\nlevel, and have made the following changes:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The &quot;Jolt&quot; spell has had its casting time reduced.<br/>\n- The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonks:<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty.  The <br/>\nadditional allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric:<br/>\n<br/>\nCelestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that <br/>\nare incompatible with that configuration.  We have therefore removed <br/>\nthe cure components and increased the healing provided by this spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark <br/>\nof Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell&#39;s <br/>\ncurrent function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less <br/>\ndesirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its <br/>\nduration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; <br/>\nvalue decreased.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Fungal Regrowth*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Fungal Regrowth&quot; is now a self-only spell.  It was being used as an <br/>\noffensive spell by virtue of its &quot;snare&quot; effect upon the target.  <br/>\nFurthermore, we ruled out making it &quot;group only&quot; as with other spells <br/>\nthat have this issue, due to a class-balance concern.  The spell was <br/>\nreducing the group&#39;s desire for classes capable of casting <br/>\nregenerative magic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Attack Speed Buffs*<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any &quot;Haste&quot; item <br/>\ncombined with any &quot;Haste&quot; spell to automatically yield maximum haste, <br/>\nregardless of the level of &quot;Haste&quot; granted by each individual <br/>\ncomponent.  This fix increases the usefulness of better &quot;Haste&quot; <br/>\nequipment and spells.  The downside to this is that those who usually <br/>\nhave both items and spells active will see a reduced attack-speed <br/>\nunless outfitted with the best equipment and spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*High-Level Dungeon Balancing*<br/>\n<br/>\nVeehshan&#39;s Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order <br/>\nto address disparities in risk and reward.  For the most part, the <br/>\nquality of the &quot;common&quot; loot in Veeshan&#39;s Peak is at least as good as <br/>\nthe &quot;rares&quot; from Sebilis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes*<br/>\n<br/>\nIn accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay <br/>\nweapons can now only be equipped in the off-hand.  Included in this <br/>\nchange are the Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip.  The delay <br/>\non these weapons and the associated damage bonus to weapons in the <br/>\nprimary hand made these weapons much too powerful for their <br/>\navailability and the risk associated with their acquisition.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus <br/>\nmodified.  The damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or <br/>\nbelow) created a problem similar to the weapons above and has been <br/>\nreduced. The damage-bonus has not changed for normal-delay (28-39) <br/>\ntwo-handed weapons. The damage bonus for high-delay two-handed <br/>\nweapons (40+) has been increased.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Server Selection Screen*<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has come to our attention that new players often think that the <br/>\nhigh-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if <br/>\neveryone else is there, it must be a good server.  However, in <br/>\nMassively-Multiplayer games, less populated servers are often <br/>\nconsidered superior for gameplay.  Therefore we have marked servers <br/>\nthat would benefit from new characters as preferred servers, listing <br/>\nthem in &quot;green&quot; in the server selection window.  The preferred <br/>\nservers have populations such that an influx of new people would <br/>\nbenefit the server rather than cause overpopulation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Custom Emotes and AFK*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnimations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned <br/>\nemotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to <br/>\nbe specified. That will continue to work. So if you type &quot;/point <br/>\nBaobob&quot;, the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom <br/>\ntext to the emote, but you must specify the target as &quot;say&quot; as the <br/>\ntarget. For instance: <br/>\n<br/>\n/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it. <br/>\n<br/>\n...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text <br/>\noutput will be: &quot;CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he <br/>\nis ready to kill it.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK.  <br/>\nType &quot;/AFK &lt;message&gt;&quot; (without the brackets) to set your custom AFK <br/>\nmessage.  For instance, if you type &quot;/afk Grabbing a snack&quot;, you will <br/>\nreply with &quot;Grabbing a snack&quot; when someone sends you a /tell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Skill Gain*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by <br/>\ncharacter stats.  This will allow those with natural affinities <br/>\ntowards certain skills to improve at a greater rate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Trade Skills Enhanced*<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements, <br/>\nincluding dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging <br/>\nitems, and other things to be discovered once in game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented.  <br/>\nPlayers will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the <br/>\ngenerally available tradeskills. This includes: <br/>\n<br/>\n- Baking<br/>\n- Blacksmithing<br/>\n- Brewing<br/>\n- Jewelcraft<br/>\n- Tailoring<br/>\n- Fletching<br/>\n- Pottery <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be <br/>\nable to exceed 200.  Specialization restrictions do not include class <br/>\nor race-specific trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and <br/>\nTinkering.  Players with race or class-specific trade skills will be <br/>\nable to exceed 200 points of skill in that skill, PLUS any generally <br/>\navailable trade skill. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project.  Further <br/>\nenhancements will be made in the coming weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
