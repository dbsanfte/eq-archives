Except us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that for what ever reason - it turns out that we are *NOT*<br/>\n<br/>\nan 80% cleric<br/>\nan 80% enchanter<br/>\na 74% ranger<br/>\na 67% wizard<br/>\netc<br/>\netc<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just are NOT that way. So saying &quot;Please Verant make us second best at<br/>\nwhat *everyone* else does!&quot; just does not ring true to me. We do have a<br/>\nlittle bit of a lot of things and some very specific things that no one else<br/>\nis as good at (mana regen).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, not everything is built on pure logic and numbers.  We have have<br/>\nmeasurably &quot;3rd class&quot; numbers on some things yet when played right, we can<br/>\nhave an outstanding effect on improving the whole party.  Also, Verant is<br/>\nnot &quot;fair&quot; - Verant is evil(tm).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just distressed because high-level bard life is turning<br/>\n&gt; out to be a bore.  Why do you think I&#39;ve been pushing the<br/>\n&gt; envelope trying silly things like soloing the froglok noble?<br/>\n&gt; I tried soloing two SKs simultaneously a couple nights ago<br/>\n&gt; (and barely succeeded due to judicious use of Screech).<br/>\n<br/>\nLife at the high levels is considerably different.  There is no longer the<br/>\n&quot;lets get a group together and do something&quot; option.  High level stuff is<br/>\nlets get 3 groups and try to break Fear or Hate or go do Naggy.  Sky, heh.<br/>\nWhat can I say there?  Plan on 3 days or more or spending a lot of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets see how this looks:  Solo 1 - 20/30; Group 20/30 - 47/50; Guild/Team<br/>\n(multiple groups) 47/50 - ??  (I pick 47 since that is about normal time to<br/>\ngo to the planes.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; What I loved about playing a bard in mid-levels was that I<br/>\n&gt; constantly had to be making decisions and adjustments.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It was<br/>\n&gt; exhilarating because it was so non-deterministic.  All you<br/>\n&gt; could do was make decisions that best improved your<br/>\n&gt; probability of success<br/>\n<br/>\nGo roll a bard on a PvP server or younger server.  Or like everyone else...<br/>\nstart a twink.  Or pray that expansion has something to offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
