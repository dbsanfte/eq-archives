It&#39;s a very powerful combination.  Those two<br/>\nwill basically cancel out the damage a low blue mob does to<br/>\nyou solo.  You can imagine what it does if you&#39;re grouped.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
