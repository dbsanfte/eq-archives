At level 11, I guess you could get to<br/>\nUnrest but Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron would have danger for you and you&#39;d have to be<br/>\nreally careful getting thru to Unrest.  Then in Unrest - there are lots and<br/>\nlots of live and dead things that will want to kill you.  I suppose you<br/>\ncould be invis to live and find a spot that is safe from the death beetles<br/>\nthen get invis to undead and have your friends kill a GDBS and you run in<br/>\nand loot and run like mad for the zone.  I mean all this is theoretically<br/>\npossible - but practical?  I think not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then it would be kinda hard for a lev 11 to get thru lavastorm to the<br/>\ntemple - hell, I was attacked by a fire elemental at 26 or 28 and had to<br/>\nflee.  And then do you have 111pp to buy the gems needed to make the lambent<br/>\ngem?  But who knows if you did the quest, you might 2 levels of XP (joke)<br/>\nand you&#39;d deserve it if you survived all that!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I am the last one to say anything bad about twinking but at level 11 -<br/>\nyou&#39;d need higher levs to do all the killing and basically you&#39;d be risking<br/>\nyour life in a big way just to do the looting.  If you have the friends to<br/>\ndo the killing, let one guy get the loot items. Go with him to the temple,<br/>\ncomplete the quest together.  Not sure if the lambent gem is no drop but if<br/>\nhe has it made - you won&#39;t need to worry - ie give him the lambent stone and<br/>\nlet him make the lambent gem.  And then there&#39;s the matter of 111pp...<br/>\n<br/>\nThese quests are designed to give players in high 20&#39;s and all 30&#39;s<br/>\nsomething to do in groups.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tRaceFace [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tSaturday, October 30, 1999 2:59 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Am I too weak to get Lambent<br/>\nArmor?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;RaceFace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHello.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI must say first of all, that I&#39;m only level 11.
