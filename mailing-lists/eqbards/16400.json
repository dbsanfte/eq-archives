Drop rate really bad for us.  No bard stuff.<br/>\nAround 5.30 am we dispelled everyone and were in the process of rebuffing in<br/>\nsome special buff order we use when Uncle Innie broke loose from his &quot;stuck<br/>\nin the wall&quot; spot and patrolled his area.  He got very &quot;agro-vated&quot; at us<br/>\nand attacked us before we knew what was up.  Soon, we found out what was up<br/>\nbecause we were all thrown &quot;up&quot; into the air.  I landed on a roof top and<br/>\nhad to track back to my party.  Others were thrown thru the ceiling and<br/>\nlanded in &quot;the room with no exit.&quot;  Extended CorpseRecovery began.  Several<br/>\ntheorys were discussed on how we could get the folks out of the room with no<br/>\nexit but before we could agree on which to try first, a guide/gm showed up<br/>\nand got our folks out.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier last week, I left the very last pick-up group I will ever do.  I<br/>\nswear!  There were 3 guildies and 3 outsiders - we were camping the<br/>\nStoneSpider room.  One was a druid nobody really knew.  After I camped for<br/>\nthe night, he left a fight to chase the guano harvester.  He killed it and<br/>\ntold the group &quot;I am keeping the loot because I solo&#39;d it.&quot;  He was however<br/>\nhappy enough to be in and win a random on the Brown Chitin Protector that<br/>\ndropped off the SS earlier.  Yes they booted him and took his name for their<br/>\n&quot;never again&quot; lists.  Just hearing this tale put me over the edge.  Never<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, yes still 48 - grrr.  Too many dragon and plane raids (Crier, I know<br/>\nexactly what you mean).  And not enough blue spectres.  I guess those days<br/>\nare past.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBardette of 48 songs<br/>\n... somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 20 Mar 2000, JasonF wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Imbrued Arms and Gauntlets<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Dawnchaser<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Belt of Concordance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All in two evenings.
