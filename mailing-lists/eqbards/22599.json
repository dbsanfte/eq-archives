I guess that explains why <br/>\nlast nuke to hit doesn&#39;t get kill most of the time anymore. =) I&#39;ve survived <br/>\nquite a few fights, but for some reason haven&#39;t taken faction hits most of <br/>\nthe time. I am still warmly (or kindly I forget) to Kunark dragons. I <br/>\nspecifically remember standing under Silverwing and watching Alloria get the <br/>\nkillshot (of all people a cleric) while I was grouped with her. No faction <br/>\nhit whatsoever. Later I definitely got a hit from Phara Dar, but I am still <br/>\nnot KoS. Only a matter of time I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori{Legion}<br/>\n57th Troubador, Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the faction hate list is huge now, no longer only a max of 6 people, so if<br/>\n&gt;you fight in VP and survive any fights you will get a hit and you will no<br/>\n&gt;longer be non-KOS to the outdoor dragons or the VP dragons =/  i was warmly<br/>\n&gt;when i went in, haven&#39;t conned anything since but i think i only survived 1<br/>\n&gt;or 2 fights at the most.  i may be non-KOS til next trip.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shada<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
