Any found this yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I have been wanting to get a hero bracer for months and I read that it<br/>\nis possible you have to kill meldrath and his two mino guards to get the<br/>\nhero to spawn, is this true?  I have spent a great deal of time running<br/>\naround the gears killing potential placeholders but have never gotten him to<br/>\nspawn.  Additionally, I have read the hero is level 35 - does anyone think<br/>\nit is possible to solo him at level 40 or does he hit like a giant?<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions question...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
