A possible factor is<br/>\nthat their guilds lack many (or even any) Bards at similar level) - so I<br/>\noften through tells set up groups.  For example last Friday I got a tell<br/>\nfrom one of my buddies that they have room for one more in the Hole - and<br/>\nthey arrange a TP to get me...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as larger activities - on Xegony we&#39;ve formed an organization called<br/>\nThe Xegony Alliance of people from small-mid sized guilds where we schedule<br/>\nraids together.  It has been enormously successful (from our perspective at<br/>\nleast).   We&#39;ve done Fear, Hate, Growth, Kael, Valk&#39;s Lab,  Vox, Nag to name<br/>\na few.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are like 300 people who have registered their chars on the website.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re interested - the website is at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xegonyalliance.com\">http://www.xegonyalliance.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt started out simply as an idea and an EZ-Board Forum.  Of course required<br/>\na few people willing to take the initiative to lead the first few raids -<br/>\nbut it grew very quickly as word spread about the raids...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne side-effect of the XA is that is where I met a lot of the people on my<br/>\nfriends list now who I regularly group with...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Matt DeBarger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 05, 2001 8:35 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] High Level Blues<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile not a bard related question, this seems like a good place to get some<br/>\nfeedback on this.<br/>\nElfson is 52 now (would be pretty far into it too, cept for 2 unrezzed death<br/>\nthis weekend, ugh).  I recently left my small, &quot;family&quot; guild (it was<br/>\ndisbanding due to loss of many players). I joined a smallish (12-20 people<br/>\non during prime play, almost all 45+) guild where some of my other former<br/>\nguild mates had gone.  I like almost  everyone in the new guild, but I&#39;m not<br/>\nthrilled with the way the guild does some things (I don&#39;t want to get into<br/>\nspecifics because there are a few Veeshan bards here and don&#39;t want to start<br/>\nany trouble).  However, I basically only get to do things with guildies once<br/>\nat week at most, so essentially I&#39;m still stuck in the same problem (I end<br/>\nup in pick up groups in Karnors most nights) I had in my family guild. (I<br/>\nwas the highest lvl in the guild when I left).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what should I do?  Leave the guild and try to join a big powerful guild<br/>\n(where I won&#39;t like many of the people, but at least I&#39;ll be able to do<br/>\nguild stuff most of the time I play)?  Pretty much give up being able to<br/>\nplay after 50, and just play my cleric in my Thrusday night group (39 now)?<br/>\nSomething else?<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 52 Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
