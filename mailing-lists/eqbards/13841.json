Is that the old Unlimited Adventures?  I had<br/>\nsimilar &#39;modules&#39; using that and plan to continue the process on the new<br/>\nNeverwinter Nights when it comes out end of the year.  An interactive<br/>\nBaldur&#39;s gate with 100&#39;s of DM&#39;s out there creating virtual worlds.  Should<br/>\nbe fun.  Only problem I see with your solution is that you&#39;ll just end up<br/>\nhaving groups camping each widget dropping mob all over the place.  Make the<br/>\nwidgets number around 12 and spread them out as random drops throughout the<br/>\n100 or so mobs spread thruout the zone and it might work.  Throw in a couple<br/>\nof keys to use to get to the boss mobs area and even better.  Just remember<br/>\nnot to give the boss mobs LoS to the locked door so no one can make them<br/>\nopen it for them.  Better yet forget the keys, make them get a rogue or a<br/>\nbard to pick the locks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Papa Legba [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 27, 2000 9:29 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] My overcrowding solutuion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Papa Legba &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple solution to this, given a day to think about it I could come up<br/>\nwith 5 better ways (and thus have a variety of ways for different<br/>\ndungeons).<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery named mob in the dungeon drops a lore, no drop widget (make it<br/>\napproprtiate to the dungeon).  The boss has a lor, no drop container, in<br/>\nwhich you put the widgets, hit combine, get the reward.  A really clever<br/>\nprogrammer could even make diminishing returns for not including all the<br/>\nwidgets.  I essentially did this in many of the Gold Box Construction<br/>\nSet adventures I wrote (remember those?).  Usually it was done a little<br/>\nmore cleverly than that, but you get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith some clever programming, the EQ engine could easily give the game<br/>\nwe want it to be, just takes some time.  Also I want to volunteer my<br/>\ntime to them to write the bard song creation for EQ2.  I think JKim<br/>\nmentioned it, but I envision a sheet of music paper where you combine<br/>\nnotes, accents, rests, tempos, etc... The end result is the song you are<br/>\nsinging.  You learn more as you go up levels, plus the ability to<br/>\ncombine various techniques into a single song.  How great would that<br/>\nbe?  It would not be that hard to write, plus a song book (which lets<br/>\nyou name and save your songs could all be done and saved client side,<br/>\nmaking it easy on the server).<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont say this to criticize EQ&#39;s bards.  They have done for bards what<br/>\nBaldur&#39;s Gate did for thieves.  (made them unique and useful).  I just<br/>\nthink their base system could be so much more.  How much fun would it be<br/>\nto make your &quot;Overture of Wizard Wariness&quot; by combining some elemental<br/>\nresitance with a quick targeted stun effect? (I think accented notes<br/>\nwould give the stun effect personally)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A true dungeon crawl in EQ would only work if at the end of the dungeon<br/>\n&gt; there was some type of reward that provided enough incentive to not camp.<br/>\n&gt; This could be a major EXP gain from killing the boss mob or a treasure<br/>\n </span></blockquote>chest<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that contained several items in it.
