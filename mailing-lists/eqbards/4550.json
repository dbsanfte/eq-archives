A steady chorus of insects serenaded us as we traveled<br/>\nbeneath the huge oak trees in a southwesterly direction.  The druid in our<br/>\ncompany, Morrel Direstorm, led us to a small wood elf village where we were<br/>\nable to refresh our provisions and continue on our journey.  Not far from<br/>\nthe hamlet we encountered a lone orc centurion.  The beast was adorned in<br/>\nthe trappings of the Crushbone orcs, with a sickly, gray hide and yellow<br/>\ntusks protruding from its misshapen maw.  We followed the creature, trailing<br/>\nit to its camp situated at the bottom of a hill.  The encampment consisted<br/>\nof three small huts surrounding a huge campfire.  The huts were made of<br/>\ntanned skins stretched taut over hickory poles with primitive designs drawn<br/>\non the surface of the skins.<br/>\n\tThe orc we followed stopped to talk to one of the orcs by the<br/>\ncampfire then retreated into a hut.  Morrel informed us that the orc was the<br/>\noracle, considered the wise leader of the camp.   Having a high hatred for<br/>\nthe foul beasts, we started formulating a plan to remove the blight from the<br/>\nland.  I proceeded to enter the camp and take out the leader, when the<br/>\nlargest orc I have ever seen came rushing from the center tent!  The beast<br/>\nwas just a few inches shorter than my 7-foot height, but twice the girth.<br/>\nWith a flurry of swings and bashes, the legionnaire kept me busy trying to<br/>\ndodge, parry and attack.  Luckily the other orcs in the camp did not have<br/>\nthe gumption to join the fray.  With the druid healing and the wizard,<br/>\nMaurek Maelstrom, igniting the orc with lightning and fire, it finally<br/>\nsuccumbed to death.  In my travels in all of Norrath, I have not found a<br/>\nstronger orc than this legionnaire.  Even the powerful Shralok orcs of High<br/>\nHold pale in comparison.  Fatigued from the battle, we moved to the south<br/>\naway from the camp to recuperate.<br/>\n\tWe followed the line of hills to the west, passing by a few vacated<br/>\ncamps.  At one point we passed by a structure of stones that had fallen in<br/>\ndisrepair. Morrel informed us that it was a gathering place for what the<br/>\nwood-folk call fae drakes, related to the pixies and brownies of Lesser<br/>\nFaydark.  They were not malicious to us, so after a brief rest and vigilance<br/>\nover the &#39;butterflies&#39; (that is what they reminded me of) we continued on<br/>\nour journey. <br/>\n\tAs we continued traveling westward, the forest became unnaturally<br/>\nquiescent.  No sound.  No wind.    From what we could tell, not a living<br/>\nentity stirred in this part of the forest.  Unsettling?  Yes.  Oppressive?<br/>\nVery. An ill omen of what was to come?  Perhaps.  But we are hardened<br/>\nadventurers.  Brave.  Daring.  And foolish.<br/>\n\tWe found a trail that lead southward through the hills.  As we<br/>\nfollowed the roughly hewn path, the stagnation increased, almost like moving<br/>\nthrough the fetid swamp of Innothule.  There was no water, or mud bogs, just<br/>\nthe stench of rotted vegetation and decay.  And the air was thick with the<br/>\ncloying smell of death.  The trail continued to the southwest, each step<br/>\ntaking us closer to whatever was causing the decadence.  There was a point<br/>\nthat we crossed when the ground was suddenly covered in a fine mist, so<br/>\nthick that it seemed like snow.  We stopped at this point and moved<br/>\nbackwards, and the mist just as suddenly disappeared.  Something was<br/>\ndefinitely wrong here, and we were determined to find out what. We entered<br/>\nthe mists...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAhead, built into the side of a towering mountain, stood a massive<br/>\nedifice.  The path we followed led into a small courtyard with a pool in the<br/>\ncenter.  A turret stood on a hill to the right of the path, standing like a<br/>\nhuge, stone guardian watching over the entrance to its master&#39;s domain.<br/>\nJust as we reached the base of the tower, a hideous scream filled the air.<br/>\nA dark elf adorned in plate armor came running toward us!  Atop his head<br/>\nrested a helm shaped in the form of a demon, with horns protruding from the<br/>\ncrown and jagged teeth just above the mouth.  The dark elf spoke in a voice<br/>\nthat seemed like it emitted from within a sepulcher, and his breath smelled<br/>\nof decay and rot.<br/>\n\t\t&quot;Welcome to Mistmoore.  I am the harbinger of your death!&quot;<br/>\n\tI brought my swords up in front of me, trying to deflect the blows<br/>\nof the harbinger.  The speed of the demon was phenomenal, his dirk and<br/>\nrapier darting between my defenses and scoring several severe blows.  The<br/>\nwizard stood back and unleashed a lightning bolt, the hot energy coursing<br/>\nover the harbinger at the same time the druid cast his spell. <br/>\n\tWith a demoniac laugh, the dark elf continued his onslaught,<br/>\nunaffected by the magical attack.  Morrel moved back a few steps and healed<br/>\nme, but the wounds the black fiend inflicted on my person were far more<br/>\ndeadly than the druids&#39; power could overcome.  I slowly retreated, keeping<br/>\nthe harbingers attention to me while my comrades fled the mist.  At my first<br/>\nopportunity, I turn and followed my friends to safety. Oddly enough, the<br/>\nharbinger did not follow us from the mist.  Perhaps the dark elf gained his<br/>\npower from the mist.  Perhaps he was bound to the mists in a way we did not<br/>\nunderstand.  I believe he was fettered to the mists by the vileness of his<br/>\nown heart and his veneration to the God of Hate.  <br/>\n\tWe tarried at the edge of the mists until my wounds were made whole<br/>\nand the two spellcasters had finished meditating.  We were determined to<br/>\ninvestigate the courtyard that we glimpsed from the trail, to at least gain<br/>\nsome knowledge of the area so that we might come back when we were more<br/>\npowerful and greater in numbers.  By the time we recuperated, the sun was<br/>\nsinking below the mountains, leaving the region in ever-shifting shadows.<br/>\nWe gathered our belongings and entered the mists once again.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tWith sunlight streaming through the mountains the courtyard had<br/>\nlooked foreboding to say the least.  With darkness descending, the courtyard<br/>\ntransformed into something more horrific, something directly manifested from<br/>\nthe insane mind of Cazic-Thule himself.   The mist had thinned somewhat with<br/>\nnight approaching.  The first thing I noticed were the dead.  Corpses were<br/>\nstrewn everywhere, covering the ground like misshapen lumps of earth.  Some<br/>\nhad been dead for some time, naked from the scavengers except for a few<br/>\npieces of rotted clothing.  Others had been slain recently; their eyes still<br/>\nwide in terror,  blood seeping from their many wounds.  Some I recognized -<br/>\nAramis, Garan, Mahlyn, Morstangar.   Others were as strange to me as the<br/>\nland I now found myself.  There were wolves lying dead next to humans and<br/>\ndwarfs and elves. Morrel informed us in a strangled voice that they were<br/>\ndruids in the guise of wolves.  The dissonance was the most disturbing,<br/>\nhowever.  Screams of pain and torture filled the night air. Sounds of battle<br/>\ncould be heard coming from a trail leading up the mountain.  Then silence.<br/>\n\tWe stood there for a few moments, listening to the dead, eyes wide<br/>\nopen for any danger lurking in the darkness.  A faint din broke the silence.<br/>\nIt sounded like running footsteps that grew louder and louder with each<br/>\npassing moment.  The three of us were turning in circles, to see where the<br/>\nnoise was coming from.  Then I heard the shout.<br/>\n\t &quot;Run!&quot;<br/>\n\tComing down the trail was a lone paladin, his silver armor covered<br/>\nin dents and blood.  Trailing behind him were creatures so unspeakable I<br/>\nshutter just remembering their ghastly visages and malformed bodies.  Some<br/>\nwere dark elves dressed in armor and wearing the same demon-skull the<br/>\nharbinger wore.   Some were much worse.  <br/>\n\tWe turned and started running up the trail, leaving swirling eddies<br/>\nof mist in our wake.  I heard the crumble of armor on stone and turned to<br/>\nlook.  The paladin had fallen, his gore-splattered helmet slowly rocking<br/>\nback and forth.  I took a step forward, my heart telling me to help the poor<br/>\nfellow.   But my mind stopped me.  Perched on the back of the fallen paladin<br/>\nis a werewolf, its mangy coat glistening with the blood of the hero.  I look<br/>\ninto the eyes of the beast and it smiles menacingly.  It smiles!   Something<br/>\ndrops from the open maw.  The arm of the paladin!  I quickly turned and ran<br/>\njust as the salivating beast leaped toward me.  Ahead I saw where the mist<br/>\nended and started running faster.  A vicious blow sent me reeling through<br/>\nthe air, striking the ground hard.  Dazed, I felt something at my shoulder<br/>\npulling at me.  I turned around and brought my dirk out, ready to thrust it<br/>\nin the chest of the foul beast. But it wasn&#39;t there.  Morrel is standing<br/>\nover me, his spells sending healing warmth through my body.  The ground is<br/>\nclear of the mists, and it seems the beast stopped at the edge.  We did not<br/>\nenter the mists again.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
