In the <br/>\npast, I always knew I could outrun anything I might aggro┬à yesterday, <br/>\nI was not so sure. *Grins*<br/>\n<br/>\n#2) I have been thinking about trying to get a SS bracer, but really <br/>\ndo not want to put the time in the camp. EQ Prices has them listed in <br/>\nthe 2K-2.5K range, but a couple of my friends kinda laughed and said <br/>\nI would be looking in the 10K-15K range┬à what is the price of the <br/>\nbracer, and how good are they? (BTW, this is on Xegony.)<br/>\n<br/>\n#3) Speaking of equipment, I think it is time I look at replacing my <br/>\nLizardscale cloak. (I am level 52) I have been getting a LOT of grief <br/>\nfrom my guildmates over this (much as I did when they found out I was <br/>\nstill wearing a collar of undead protection.)
