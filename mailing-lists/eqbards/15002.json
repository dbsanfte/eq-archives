I do believe that no matter how many<br/>\ntests you do Verant is going to quietly ignore it.  Same with the shaman<br/>\npost in the EQ forum that ran tests on AGI, DEX and the like.  Gord-o asked<br/>\nthem to run the test, yet that post has been ignored.  All the man has to<br/>\ndo is reply to it with at least a simple, &quot;ok, thanks for running the test<br/>\nfor me.  We&#39;ll look in to it.&quot;.  I personally feel that Gord-o has turned<br/>\nin to more of a corporate man recently, not a person for the people.  All<br/>\nthese posts about problems are getting bumped while he is busy responding<br/>\nto posts about the history or Norrath.
