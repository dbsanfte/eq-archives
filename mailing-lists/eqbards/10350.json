It&#39;s just nicer to have more party members because<br/>\n&gt; that increases your survivability, which is true anyway<br/>\n&gt; regardless of Psalm.  Having more party members actually makes<br/>\n&gt; Psalm account for a smaller percentage of the total damage<br/>\n&gt; applied to the mobs - the mobs die quicker so they have less<br/>\n&gt; time to beat themselves against your damage shields.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  That is the issue I missed before.  More players brings more<br/>\n  collective hp to the table, thus you can balance dmg to players.<br/>\n  But as for Psalm, it&#39;s dmg ratio then decreases as more people<br/>\n  beat down the multiple enemies.  So is the 5,6,7,8 dmg to each<br/>\n  mobs contact swing better than the bard with a lute and hymm<br/>\n  with some form of speed up attack in a big party?  Despite the<br/>\n  fact healing will draw frenzy on the bard from mobs not being<br/>\n  detained.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think you have different scenarios based on number of players.<br/>\n  A full group would most likely benefit from atkspeed/ac/healing<br/>\n  than trying to weave in a dmg shield from psalm.  Still, it is<br/>\n  possible in best case to weave all of these songs together.  I&#39;m<br/>\n  just trying to be realistic in these days of lag and other bard<br/>\n  song enemies.  keeping 3 songs steady is getting tougher.  All<br/>\n  effects have to be off, the more mobs - the more polys to render,<br/>\n  the servers are getting much more laggy due to connectivity, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Assuming multiple encounters:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Soloing melee - Psalm make work out beter.<br/>\n  Soloing magic - AE DoT damage songs with instruments are awesome.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Small Party melee/magic - John&#39;s formulas.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Large Party melee/magic - Full atkspeed,healing,utility (protect/mana)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
