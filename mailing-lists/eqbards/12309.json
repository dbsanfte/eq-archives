I dropped to one full bub.  When I died in Mistmoore (green<br/>\nmob) my exp bar was at about the point where I died the first time.  This<br/>\ntime I dropped below one full bub of experience, (i.e. I could see white<br/>\nspace).  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci (still stuck on one full bub of exp in his first hell level<br/>\nbut has figured out the solution to where he doesn&#39;t have to worry about it<br/>\nanymore: stop dying so much)<br/>\n30 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What you described may be 100% true but I don&#39;t think it applies to what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happened to me.  Both times I died I was 30th level.  The experience<br/>\n&gt; loss<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (i.e. visual amount the bar decreased) for getting killed by the green<br/>\n&gt; mob<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was definately more than it was for dying to the red mob.  Still<br/>\n&gt; wondering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if other people have had similar results.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How much did you lose?  I&#39;ve seen the same thing in hell<br/>\n&gt; levels, and I always figured it was due to roundoff error.  <br/>\n&gt; e.g. Say I lose 2.5 pixels of exp per death.  First death I go<br/>\n&gt; from 45.9 pixels to 43.4 pixels, or 45-&gt;43.  Second death I go<br/>\n&gt; from 46.1 pixels to 43.6, or 46-&gt;43.  The second death looks<br/>\n&gt; like I lost 50% more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are also little visual tricks going on depending where<br/>\n&gt; the exp bar is within a bubble - movement near the middle is<br/>\n&gt; not as apparent as movement near the edges.  Movement in the<br/>\n&gt; first and last bubbles can be completely masked when the end<br/>\n&gt; of the exp bar is obscured by the little decoration.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
