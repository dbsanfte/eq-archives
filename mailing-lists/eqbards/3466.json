If ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-72806831\">I agree with you that it is a matter of balance, but I think it should go the<br/>\nother way. I think casters should only be able to bind themselves to cities. If<br/>\neveryone could be bound anywhere there&#39;d be no reward for risking trips to out<br/>\nof the way places (like Guk). I routinely spend time in Splitpaw dungeon which<br/>\nis about a 20-25 minute walk from the nearest bind point. But because of this it<br/>\nis rare to see more than 10 people in there. If anyone could be bound right<br/>\noutside the entrance it would be just like Blackburrow, Crushbone, et.al.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp,<br/>\nTaelin, Songweavers of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; SoW doesn&#39;t affect what your character can do, other than kiting, only how<br/>\n&gt; long it takes.  Bind definitely affects where you can adventure.  Ever seen<br/>\n&gt; anyone in Upper Guk who the mobs weren&#39;t all green to?  You can bet they<br/>\n&gt; were either an evil race or a caster.  Its a five zone run for any<br/>\n&gt; non-caster good race, far too dangerous, untill nearly everything in Guk is<br/>\n&gt; green to you.  Believe me I will never play another character who does not<br/>\n&gt; get bind, period.  It is way too limiting.  I left Erudin with very little<br/>\n&gt; exploration because there was literally no one there who could bind me, even<br/>\n&gt; to the city!  I&#39;ve likewise had to wait over an hour just to get bound in<br/>\n&gt; Kaladim because there was no one around who could bind me.  Of course had I<br/>\n&gt; been a caster I was certainly high enough, 14th level to bind myself both<br/>\n&gt; times.  I went to Guk, looked around and left.  Its too far to run when<br/>\n&gt; everything around will cause a train and give no xp, except for a few<br/>\n&gt; critters in the interior who are red.  If I was even a 12th level mage type<br/>\n&gt; I would have stayed since the run would be measured in seconds, not half<br/>\n&gt; hours.  Pure and simple, on average one death in Guk would take up my entire<br/>\n&gt; evening of gaming and as a bard I run as fast as anyone.  That is an<br/>\n&gt; imbalance, not a class distinction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
