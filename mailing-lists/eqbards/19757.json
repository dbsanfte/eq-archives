I used to try to convince people I really was a bard.  I did have<br/>\na few people ask me where I got my Barbarian Illusion mask though.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven funnier I was standing in FV the other day with my halfling druid.  I<br/>\nhad a Mandolin out at the time to show another bard that anyone could equip<br/>\nit.  I then had two other people, one another bard, giving me the what for<br/>\nbecause they thought it was really sick I was using the Halfling Skin Mask<br/>\nfrom Nektulous Forest.

If so, have a barbarian friend equip it<br/>\nand convince people there&#39;s a new mask out there.  ;^)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 11 missed notes, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWas the salesman clueless?
