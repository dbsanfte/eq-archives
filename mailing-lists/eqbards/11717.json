We did an assault on Mistmoore castle.  4 groups of 30&#39;s to <br/>\nlow 40&#39;s (i am lvl 35) went in the secret way from the crypt up to the <br/>\nbedroom.  We cleared all the hallways and the bathrooom, then set up base in <br/>\nthe bedroom.  Got the black silk gloves off the 10th Deathly Usher I looted. <br/>\n  Not as common as I was expecting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I had the gypsy musicians on track, but the groups were reluctant to <br/>\npull them.  They said there were 5 hard mobs between us and the musicians.  <br/>\nI believe it.  At one point our 4 groups were completely destroyed.  The <br/>\nspawns there are very deadly.  We often were fighting 6-8 mobs.  Perhaps <br/>\npart of the problem was the groups learning to work together.  Anyway, for <br/>\nthose who have yet to get the gypsy lute, be advised that this is no small <br/>\ntask.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, I was able to get the Deep Water Goblin&#39;s Opaline helm on <br/>\nthe 3rd try.  I knew nothing of these DW Goblins, so be warned that <br/>\nattacking one will likely get you 5-6 plus their pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewduer<br/>\nworking on Lambent at 35 and finding it pretty hard going</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
