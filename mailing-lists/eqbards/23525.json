But hush up when it&#39;s<br/>\ntime for loot distribution.  Bards aren&#39;t worth uber loot, or spending<br/>\neffort on&quot;  &lt;-- General attitude of guilds towards their bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaelrei<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve never seen him on the Black Scar cycle, only on the Fairie of Dismay<br/>\n </span></blockquote>cycle.  In any case, he wasn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that hard to get.  We just go into Skyfire from BW between Ixlblat Fer<br/>\n </span></blockquote>pulls for the Clerics and pull any<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; named MOBs to zone.  Usually see him within a couple of hours.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m still five pieces short.  My guild is apparently bored with Fear (why<br/>\n </span></blockquote>go when only a few people need<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; things?), so the whip may not be that easy (I&#39;m hoping to multi-quest).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Phinegel is a sticking point; my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; guild will drop anything for anyone&#39;s epic MOB but Phinny.  We haven&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>taken him in a month.  (Our senior<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bard got his spine by buying a multi-quest from some group that looted it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and had no bard.)  Red Scale I&#39;m<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; still behind several warriors.  White Scale is stupid, either kill the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hardest dragon in Kunark or kill a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; dragon that Verant won&#39;t let me fight.  And Trak guts?  Bah.  My guild<br/>\n </span></blockquote>doesn&#39;t seem interested in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bothering with Trak now that they can get so many easy BP drops in PoG.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And it&#39;s not like this is a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; guaranteed drop, like it is with Ragefire (who is a pansy by comparison).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s on the order of a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; one in six shot.

The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question I have is if he is on the same cycle as Black Scar, and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other named ones?  Seems like black scar, and some other named<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chromodrac spanwed every time.  Is Eldrig just rare?  (Like the lava<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; walkder?)  Or is there some other trick to get him to spawn?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Laluni Songhammer, 51 Bard of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
