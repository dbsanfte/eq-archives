The dirk (light and fast)<br/>\nCrushes tunic (AC12, +8 magic fire and cold resist and only 4 pounds or<br/>\nso) and the SBS, great shield before you have dual wield! (ac10, +10<br/>\nmagic resist and light). <br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to mention that the Tunic and Shield are now officially LORE<br/>\nitems, meaning you may only possess one (including if you have one in<br/>\nbank!). I believe the Dirk has been one for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, what i was getting to, in CrushBone today, there was someone<br/>\nsoloing crush and dvinn and LEAVING the itmes on the corpses! then he<br/>\nwould shout &quot;Come get Dvinn&#39;s dagger for free&quot; &quot;Come get crush&#39;s tunic<br/>\nfor free&quot;. This was happenning on the innoruk server. so, if you are in<br/>\nneed of these items, take a stroll over to CB, maybe you will get lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I had already bought both the tunic and dirk, at retail value :( )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rochelle<br/>\nReplace &quot;nospam&quot; with &quot;HOME&quot; to reply</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
