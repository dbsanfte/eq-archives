You swim down and it takes you to a larger chamber,<br/>\nyou have to swim up the lavafall to get back out so I didn&#39;t want to stay<br/>\ndown there too long to look around. Anyone know what is down here, is it<br/>\njust some crappy area that does nothing?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a tunnel in Sol B that goes under the king room. I swam along<br/>\nit once and came up in a small room (I guess it&#39;s somewhere to swim if you<br/>\ncan&#39;t get out of the lava).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a bad weekend though, died 3 times last night in Mistmoore whilst<br/>\ncamping the Cloaked Vampire (our monk tried to pull Lasna and kinda brought<br/>\nthe whole castle with him, was not a pretty sight. This happened twice, my<br/>\n3rd death was for some unknown reason a damn caster saw me whilst f*cking<br/>\ninvis (in the area before the castle) and somehow killed me in one cast<br/>\nwhile I was naked.<br/>\n<br/>\nStupid stupid game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 36 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
