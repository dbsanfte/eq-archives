My comment wasn&#39;t really directed at you in <br/>\nparticular but in general when I see people post &quot;Blah Blah since <br/>\nBeta 1&quot; as part of their sig line, it usually comes when they&#39;re <br/>\ncontradicting someone else&#39;s opinion... To me, it seems like they&#39;re <br/>\nsaying, &quot;I&#39;ve been around longer than you, so I know.&quot;  I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t buy into that philosophy and personally don&#39;t think there&#39;s <br/>\nanything more special about a Level 60 Bard compared to a Level 25 <br/>\nBard.  Or someone who&#39;s been playing since 4000 BC vs. someone who <br/>\nbought the game yesterday.  Obviously, not everyone who uses a <br/>\nsimilar sig is implying the same thing and that&#39;s where some more <br/>\ninformation would have been important to illustrate what I meant.  <br/>\nSorry for what looked like a cheap shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nBard of Kunark since... well, Kunark came out. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Lyrnia Jongleur<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Bard of Norrath since Beta 2&quot; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
