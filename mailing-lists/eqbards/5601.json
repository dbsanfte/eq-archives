I&#39;m only 22d<br/>\nlevel so haven&#39;t had the chance to play with Chain yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently fighting primarily in Unrest and Mistmoore.  In Unrest, the<br/>\nLullably and Largos&#39; Binding song are pretty reliable, especially if I equip<br/>\nan instrument.  I don&#39;t get many resists when I play those two songs.  In<br/>\nMistmoore, the creatures there seem to resist those two songs more<br/>\nfrequently, especially Largo&#39;s.  I assume that is because the creatures in<br/>\nMistmoore are higher level than those in Unrest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I get Chain at level 23, will it be consistently effective/reliable if<br/>\nI use it against creatures that con yellow and red to me?  Based on my prior<br/>\nexperience, I would assume the answer is no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Huh?  Chain is snare + it lessens the attackspeed of the mob.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t get it.  What do you think chain does?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I will always override every snare/root I see with chains, much<br/>\n&gt; more effective for the party.  Slower attacks and the effect of<br/>\n&gt; snare.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I chain something, it AINT moving.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
