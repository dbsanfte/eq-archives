I&#39;ve been hunting a lot<br/>\noutdoors, and can make money pretty fast now if I need to, so I&#39;m more<br/>\ninterested in going somewhere that might have interesting loot items.  I<br/>\nhave considered Solusek&#39;s Eye but not sure if I am high enough to do well<br/>\nthere.  Any other suggestions?  I can solo high blues even I have found<br/>\nsince I reached 20th, but prefer to group.  Would there be groups in Sol A<br/>\nthat would be the right levels for me?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
