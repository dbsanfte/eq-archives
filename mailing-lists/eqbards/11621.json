If you don&#39;t know Sol A, don&#39;t worry, my<br/>\ndescription is unimportant.  What is important is that I was pulling from<br/>\nthe bar room area to the safe room where we were camped.  There was an<br/>\nannoying Young goblin wizard that spawned near the door I was pulling from.<br/>\nRather then pull it, I just lamented it and ignored it for the next 6 or 7<br/>\npulls (it conned very green to my party).  Since I didn&#39;t have bellow memmed<br/>\nor throwing dagger with me, I have to run up and hit the MOB to get it<br/>\nagro&#39;ed.  Everytime I ran the MOB by the young wizard, it would cast a<br/>\ndamage shield on the MOB and we would spend the rest of the fight getting<br/>\n&quot;you are burned&quot; messages :P.  I finally got sick of it and just killed the<br/>\nsob, but I found it very humerous that it was perfectly timing its spells on<br/>\nevery pull to make sure my mob got a little bit of extra help against us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 30th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 09, 1999 2:08 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Sonorous clouding<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The first time I walked all the way from the zone to 4C in Cazic I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; attacked.  I conned everything along the way and everything was<br/>\n&gt; indifferent.<br/>\n&gt; Next time I walked thru I assumed I was safe and didn&#39;t con any<br/>\n&gt; lizards as I<br/>\n&gt; moved.  I walked by a lizard in the maze and got attacked.  The best<br/>\n&gt; explanation I have to why it saw thru the invis was that the<br/>\n&gt; lizard had the<br/>\n&gt; see invis spell buff.  I don&#39;t know if lizard spellcasters can<br/>\n&gt; actually cast<br/>\n&gt; this spell but if they can that would easily explain it.  If they<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t cast<br/>\n&gt; see invis then I have no idea what happened.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have a theory about Sonorous Coulding failing. It has failed for me a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few times (although I have NEVER been attacked my any lizard in CT :). I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; noticed (and posted) my success in Unrest a few days ago. My only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; failure was when a mob spawned right near me and immediately attacked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then today I read a post from someone who was in CT and looking at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spawns in the Throne Room, they stated that 2 mobs walked in OR spawned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and saw thru their invis.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know certain mobs can see invis, and that invis can fail, but neither<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I nor the poster got &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It appears that sonorous clouding works on mobs that are in the zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when it pulses, but mobs who spawn and have not had a &quot;dose&quot; (pulse) of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it can see thru it.
