That is the &#39;supplier room&#39; (iirc) and both the supplier<br/>\nand assassin spawn in there (keep your back to the wall - the froggies have<br/>\na mean back stab.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you go from the bedroom to the tower, you need to have invis to unded<br/>\nbut even so - the GDBS (bad skellys) will agro on you if you don&#39;t hug the<br/>\nwall on the right hand side as you go by them. You cant merely waltz by<br/>\nthinking your invis to unded will hold them at bay.  I have heard that 35ish<br/>\nbards can lament them and pull singles. Or if you have 2 groups moving into<br/>\nthe tower and the bedroom is camped - you can just kill all them skellies<br/>\nand be done with it.  The reason you don&#39;t go around the other way with<br/>\ninvis to unded is that there is live stuff there that could see and agro you<br/>\nas well as unded stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 38th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tMoss [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Olmoss@...\">Olmoss@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, December 13, 1999 9:18 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Mask of Deception<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tMoss &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Olmoss@...\">Olmoss@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n\t\t(snips)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; and after 2 1/2 hours the assassin eventually spawned<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(constant ph&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; before hand), we killed him and my wizzie friend looted.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t\t  What room John ? <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tand later some one opined &quot;The assassin<br/>\n\t\tspawns up the stairs&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHunh ? ...any ideas because just being in lower<br/>\n\t\tGuk gives me sweaty palms :) I died just getting to the<br/>\nrooms when the<br/>\n\t\tperson who was leading me in had her invisibility to the<br/>\ndead go down<br/>\n\t\tright in the middle of a pack of Greater Ice Bones.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
