One of his coworkers just suggested that if he didn&#39;t like<br/>\ntesting he could go work on EQ.  Unfortunately my cube neighbor fell out of<br/>\nhis chair he laughed so hard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, the glass is half empty cause all these bugs are driving me to<br/>\ndrink!  Come to think of it, half a glass is getting close to being half a<br/>\nswallow!  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n\tHappy, just not happy with EQ!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
