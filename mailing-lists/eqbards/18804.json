In my<br/>\nexperience with the older zones, the only mobs that could see thru invis<br/>\nwere undead and any mob that could cast the See Invis spell.  I&#39;ve walked<br/>\ncompletely thru Mistmoore with invis song up and everything I saw conned<br/>\nIndifferent.  Almost all of the mobs that were in there were yellow or<br/>\nhigher to me.  I realize there were a few other mobs that could see thru<br/>\ninvis but they were the exception not the norm.  Now it seems that for the<br/>\nmost part invisibility in Kunark is almost worthless.  I&#39;ve been fighting<br/>\nthe giants in Frontier Mtns and everyone one of them see thru invis even<br/>\nthough they are lower than 35th level.  So red mobs in Mistmoore can&#39;t see<br/>\nme but blue mobs in Frontier Mtns can?  Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  Also, by<br/>\nthe time a warrior is high enough level to get the armor that gives this<br/>\neffect, almost everything he will be fighting can see thru invis because<br/>\nthey are a high level mob.  So I would imagine a lot of them view getting<br/>\nInvisibility in their armor almost as much as we view getting Summon Water<br/>\nas worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 18, 2000 12:14 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] GZ answers some bard questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel 25 is &quot;nifty&quot; to get something like this.  level 53 to get these is<br/>\ncompletely useless.  a warrior getting invisibility at level 53 however is<br/>\nsomething they would absolutely DIE for.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
