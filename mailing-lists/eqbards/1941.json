When you said faster was<br/>\nbetter because of &quot;more dual wield checks&quot; I thought you were<br/>\nsaying the additional dual wield checks in and of themselves<br/>\nwere causing the extra damage, which they do not.  It&#39;s the<br/>\nabove factors (damage bonuses skewed to favor faster weapons)<br/>\ncompounded with the additional checks that cause faster<br/>\nweapons to be favored.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you said &quot;all other things being equal,&quot; I took that to<br/>\nmean the faster and slower weapon had the exact same final<br/>\ndamage over time, just their speed is different.  If that&#39;s<br/>\nthe case, then what I wrote up is correct - all dual wield<br/>\ndoes is scale the effectiveness of the weapon by a flat<br/>\npercentage.  But it seems you meant the raw stats (dam/delay<br/>\nratio) being equal (I apologize for not making this<br/>\ndistinction clear in my example - I was just trying to keep it<br/>\nsimple).  There is still something nonlinear going on here<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t see (the double attack not going off on the<br/>\nsecond hand until dual wield passes 149 is an example of the<br/>\ntype of nonlinearity that could cause the effect you<br/>\ndescribe).  But given your clarification, I agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does, however, turn the original question (dirk and<br/>\ncombine, which in which hand?) into a really muddled mess.  I<br/>\nsuppose that&#39;s what you wanted though - no quick and easy way<br/>\nto figure out the optimal arrangement.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry for using such a large chunk of bandwidth, this was never intended to<br/>\n&gt; be such a lengthy thread on my part, simply an interjection, and a lot of it<br/>\n&gt; was due to perhaps less than clear language from me.  This is my attempt to<br/>\n&gt; correct that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it got you to spill the beans on some of the internal<br/>\nworkings of the game, so I&#39;m happy.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
