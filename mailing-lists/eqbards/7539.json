Not only have I loved my Bard (level15) since day 1,<br/>\nbut my Shaman (level 30) as well.  Finding a way to compensate for the<br/>\nweaknesses and augment the strengths of any given level is the fun of the<br/>\ngame.  For instance, at level 30, my Shaman is now a healer/buffer.  My<br/>\ndamage spells aren&#39;t really as effective at this point, whereas two levels<br/>\nago they were my mainstay.  I could easily complain that the Shaman class<br/>\nsucks at dealing damage after level 29, but the fact is, at this level, it<br/>\nis simply not my strength.  This will change again after I get my next tier<br/>\nof spells.  I&#39;m sure the Bard is the same way, although she is not yet at a<br/>\nhigh enough level for it to be really noticeable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe fun of  &quot;hybrid&quot; characters is that you have to<br/>\ncontinually evolve as you acquire new songs/spells.  I think a lot of people<br/>\nfind an effective way to play their character at an early level and then<br/>\nrefuse to change their methods as they mature, thus becoming dissatisfied<br/>\nwith their character as it seems &quot;weak.&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tTani <br/>\n\t\tSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom:\tGarramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSent:\tThursday, September 30, 1999 5:14 PM<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Question...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tis anyone happy with the classes they play?<br/>\nbesides me i guess.  you do<br/>\n\t\t\t\tknow all of these particular things were in<br/>\neffect since the game came out.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tdid you expect them to change?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t\t\t&gt; \tNo bind, not a caster class<br/>\n\t\t\t\t&gt; \tNo Parry, not a melee class<br/>\n\t\t\t\t&gt; \tNo special weapons, not a hybrid<br/>\n </span></blockquote>class<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t\t\t&gt; \tetc., etc., etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t\t\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tDoes Windows keep &quot;&quot;bugging&quot;&quot; you?
