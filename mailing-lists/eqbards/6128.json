That would be the furthest from<br/>\nmy mind.  But their are certain psychological factors that come into play,<br/>\nthat cannot be ignored.  I play an 18th level Human Bard on Brell.  I am<br/>\ndecked out currently in a full set of banded.  I like the protection that it<br/>\ngives me, but the helmet has got to go.  Banded Helms on a male human look<br/>\nlike some kind of crazy WWII style third reich comedy.  I am constantly<br/>\ngetting comments about how I look like a schultz from Hogans Hero&#39;s.  :(<br/>\nThis was really funny at first and I have laughed my ass off at myself on<br/>\nmore that one occasion, (especially while doing the silly DDD dance).  But<br/>\nit is starting to wear on me now, and I need some advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI though that perhaps I might want to get a blackend iron helm, and I have<br/>\nbeen /auction&#39;ing for one for the last week, but I finally saw a guy last<br/>\nnight wearing one, and it looks the same.  If fact, it looks even more<br/>\nNazi-like because its black.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm at the point now that I will remove my helmet when I get to populated<br/>\nareas and towns because I just dont think that a Bard would be wearing that<br/>\nugly thing while perfoming.  However I really need the AC boost from it to<br/>\nbe effective in combat.  The people I play with ask me if its my songs or<br/>\nthe helmet that the Orc of Highpass hate.  And I&#39;m not sure anymore:(<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nDoes anyone know if there is a helm comparable Banded that looks different<br/>\non Humans, and where might I get one?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone tell me if the Plate Helm looks similarly silly?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any other armor types that will protect me &gt;= Banded and make me<br/>\nlook different, while not being unattainable by a 18th level untwinked bard?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the whole thing is silly and I don&#39;t want to be superficial.  My<br/>\ncharacter is not my helmet - my helmet is not my character :) but the whole<br/>\nthing really kinda has me down.  Thanks for any comments ahead of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin 18th level Human Bard<br/>\non Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
