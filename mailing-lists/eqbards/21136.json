Are<br/>\nthey hurting you in any way?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, you say how much it stinks to break the plane (deaths and<br/>\ntime) but then criticze others for not wanting to do it themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven:  Guild XYZ has broken Fear.  Guild ABC wants to hit fear later.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoice1: Go in when we&#39;re ready and kill stuff as it shows up.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoice2:  Wait till later then do the whole break thing our selves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf depends on what you want.  There is nothing wrong with either choice, its<br/>\njust a different play style.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
