Excalibur is a great guild, <br/>\n&gt; but just never able to field enough folks of a similiar level <br/>\n&gt; to go do anything. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think guild size is hitting a few of us. Dragon&#39;s Claw has always <br/>\nbeen &quot;almost there&quot;, but we have always had to pull in a few friends <br/>\nfor the larger kills -- VS, Char Royalty, etc... We were lucky enough <br/>\nto find another guild -- League of Gallantry -- who share DC&#39;s goals <br/>\nand vision, and who were looking to become a bit larger. Tonight is <br/>\nthe official merger of the two guilds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Darkfox - We were actually after the Procurator for a key to<br/>\n&gt; South and hopefully a bard mask. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I must have missed this... what Bard mask?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia: Grats on the BP!<br/>\nSlyde: 54 is bad, but I am sure you will be 55 soon enough.<br/>\nDarkfox: Good to actually spend a few minutes talking to you face-to-<br/>\nface over the weekend. I think that is the first time I have ever <br/>\ntalked to you when I could see you. *Grins*<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the silly Wizard porting your group on accident, our last trip <br/>\ninto HS was also interrupted by a wizard hitting the wrong spell and <br/>\nporting his group out. Although the worst miscast spell I have <br/>\nwitnessed in there was about two weeks ago -- a druid friend and I <br/>\nthought we would get some exp and go solo the entrance to HS (we <br/>\nhave &quot;broken&quot; it before waiting for others to arrive.) Anway, she <br/>\ngets HTed by a new spawn and goes to heal herself... the next thing I <br/>\nknow she is dead! Seems she accidentially DDed herself (talk about a <br/>\nbad time not to resist. *Smiles*) So... there I am, stuck with two <br/>\nMOBs and no help. All I can say is thank Erollisi for SoT and Thurg <br/>\ngate potions. *Grins*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
