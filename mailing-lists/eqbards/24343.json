What I will say, is that it is accurate to the best of my <br/>\nknowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1, Now that you have the basic stuff down, roughly how long <br/>\n&gt;does Hate take to clear now?  I remember per patch people used <br/>\n&gt;to do planes in about 4 - 8 or so hours, baring problems.  Due <br/>\n&gt;to pathing and such now, im curious how much longer poh will <br/>\n&gt;take on average.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We usually spend some extra time working the lower level to make sure <br/>\nwe have little &quot;extra&quot; aggro on level 2. This weekend, we were <br/>\nhunting in 10-12 hour blocks... I would say we spend 3-4 hours in <br/>\nlower before heading up. With that said, we have NEVER cleared upper. <br/>\nWe have killed a lot of MOBs, but tracking shows there to always be <br/>\nplenty more. *Grins*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. Have you come to a conclusion what the spawn time on the <br/>\n&gt;2nd floor mobs are?  12hrs same as level 1? Mini-bosses 24?  <br/>\n&gt;less? more?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I cannot answer either of these. What I can say is that when we go <br/>\nback up the next day, the MOBs have respawned. The mini-bosses see to <br/>\nbe on a &gt;24 hour timer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. Have you found a trash can to store all those ceramonial<br/>\n&gt; robes?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, yes! I have found a &quot;secret storage&quot; button located right <br/>\nabove my 8 inventory slots which does this quite well. I can&#39;t <br/>\nremember exactly how the button is labeled, but I think it is <br/>\nsomething like &quot;Destroy&quot;. *Smiles*<br/>\n<br/>\nBe well all,<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
