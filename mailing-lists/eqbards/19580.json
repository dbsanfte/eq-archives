The guy in Kaesora <br/>\nwas very helpful in telling me how difficult it would be to get the <br/>\ncoins and (from what he said) that specific coin was pretty rare, so <br/>\nI felt it was worth more.

I always offer to pay in <br/>\nmy shout to the zone and then leave it up to the person who offers to <br/>\ndecide how much they want for it.  Most people don&#39;t know what <br/>\nthey&#39;re for and are actually happy to give it away for free when you <br/>\ntell them (MENTION THAT IT&#39;S NO DROP!!!!).
