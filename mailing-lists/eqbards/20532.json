Granite, cauldrons, 2<br/>\n&gt;diamondine earrings, Mistmoore shield, Sacrificial dagger, Nightshade wreath, 2<br/>\n&gt;Crested Spaulders, and more gypsy lutes and werewolf talons than we could use<br/>\n&gt;;P.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We were headed back up to the bath to wait for Xicotl and I saw the Dhampyre on<br/>\n&gt;tracking, so we headed that way.  Oops, undead saw through invis, so we were at<br/>\n&gt;zone regrouping and then...he was trained to zone, and folks zoned out.  I<br/>\n&gt;jumped in, killed him, looted, and.....Yay! a Hooded Black Cloak to call my<br/>\n&gt;own!  Felt good to get it myself :).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It looked to me as if the drop rates were increased in Mistmoore; maybe we were<br/>\n&gt;just there a long time hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;After we finished we decided to wander over to that camp and try our luck.  My<br/>\n&gt;husband Knight (54 paladin) started pulling the Teir&#39;Dal Elites, which were all<br/>\n&gt;green to us.  Good faction adjusts though, I remember Emerald Warriors was one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Then we pulled Priestess Llandra, who is blue to us both.  The two of us chased<br/>\n&gt;her all over Lesser Faydark with chains/fear.  The fight took at least 5<br/>\n&gt;minutes.  Man she has a lot of HP!  I wasn&#39;t sure if she was a quest mob or<br/>\n&gt;not; I looked today and she is.  She dropped about 9 gold hehe.  Clerics of<br/>\n&gt;Tunare was one faction that improved.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Maravana Vireo<br/>\n&gt;54 Bard of Jus Divinum<br/>\n&gt;Mithaniel Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
