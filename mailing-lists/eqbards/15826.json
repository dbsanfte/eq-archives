I tested it against some L8 mobs, took them<br/>\nto half, then fought with weapons and added up the damage.  <br/>\nThe 50 figure above is about right.  To compare, that&#39;s about<br/>\n9 damage/sec.  My weapons test against the Allizewsaur yielded<br/>\nonly about 7-8 damage/sec (admittedly against a L50 mob).<br/>\n<br/>\nCoC + CoD do so much damage, that using them with a lute does<br/>\nmore damage than using them with weapons.  It took 10 attack<br/>\nrounds (36 seconds) of these two with a lute for me to take a<br/>\nwan down to half.  It took 14 attack rounds (45 sec) for me to<br/>\nbeat it the rest of the way with my weapons and singing these<br/>\ntwo songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 122 dam/target/round Rokenn lists above works out to 1220<br/>\ndamage/minute.  This is *on par* with two of the top necro<br/>\nDoTs stacked.  You can do a helluva lot of damage with these<br/>\nsongs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHymn + Niv&#39;s at 47 heal 29 points/tick.  At 48, it is 33<br/>\npoints/tick (tick = 6 seconds).  Over a 2 minute solo fight,<br/>\nthat&#39;s 660 points I&#39;m healing, and thus 660 &quot;extra&quot; hp I get.  <br/>\nIn comparison, Resolution is only about 200 points, Symbol of<br/>\nPiznarn is about 300 points.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Hymn, Niv&#39;s, CoC, and CoD with a lute, I&#39;ve been soloing<br/>\ngreater kobolds and wan knights losing about 0.5-1.5 bubbles.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve been soloing Solusek kobolds and zols losing about 2-3<br/>\nbubbles.  Yes, that&#39;s right, you can solo once you hit 48<br/>\nwithout having to resort to charming or Pixie Striking.  The<br/>\nonly fights that gave me problems were a high level SK armed<br/>\nwith a FS 2h sword, a high level zol also armed with a 2h<br/>\nsword (both too high level for me to charm), and a fight with<br/>\na zol where an urd jumped in (had to throw charm into the<br/>\nabove 4-song medley - finished at a half bubble, thought the<br/>\nnext hit from the zol was going to kill me and instead it just<br/>\nfell over and died).  It is sick just how much more effective<br/>\nI am using these songs instead of my weapons.  I don&#39;t care<br/>\nabout planes weapons anymore - I want a 7-stringed lute.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the DoTs turn out to be 3 ticks like I think they are, then<br/>\nI plan to see if I can arrange a Hymn, Niv&#39;s, CoC, CoD, DDD<br/>\ncombo.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
