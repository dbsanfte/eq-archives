Apparently this was not always the case.  From what I<br/>\nwas told, prior to dragon raids becoming common events, the game code<br/>\nallowed people sit down while fleeing.  This allowed players to avoid the<br/>\ndanger of fleeing via an exploit.  Once Verant saw what players were doing<br/>\nthey fixed it in a patch (a good move IMO).  <br/>\n<br/>\nHad the strategy worked, it shouldn&#39;t have been that hard to twist songs<br/>\neven while sitting.  All you had to do was stand up, switch songs, then sit<br/>\nback down.  This would have worked assuming dragon fear isn&#39;t a continuous<br/>\neffect.  All you would have to do is synchronize standing up right after the<br/>\ndragon fear spell went off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll a moot point now.  Just have to be patient and wait until I&#39;m in the 40s<br/>\nbefore I go on a raid.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Still a possible workaround but probably not worth the effort, especially<br/>\nif a high level bard is available to go on the raid.  What a lower level<br/>\nbard could do is /duel a 50 level player who can cast root.  Assuming root<br/>\nsticks, bard doesn&#39;t have to worry about fleeing.  Not certain how long a<br/>\ndragon raid takes so bard would most likely have to get rooted several times<br/>\nthroughout the battle.  Doubt the high level players would want to take the<br/>\nrisk though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; A bard can&#39;t twist songs sitting down as you know, and you are there for<br/>\n&gt; 2 things - reducing mana regen time during buffing and to buff resists<br/>\n&gt; during the fight. Without getting into a tactics discussion, if you are<br/>\n&gt; only playing 1 song during the actual dragon battle then you aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; worth the spot you are filling, and a warrior would be much better<br/>\n&gt; served in it. On every dragon raid or large scale fight, you want to<br/>\n&gt; show your group just how valuable a bard is, like when people from other<br/>\n&gt; groups die from attrition, but your resist buffs keep your party going<br/>\n&gt; until the very end.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
