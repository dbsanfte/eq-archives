For the longsword this is 4.8333 clicks - for the mino<br/>\n&gt;&gt; axe it is 4.625 clicks and for the combine longsword (as a reference) it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is 4.667.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Now - from those numbers, you can see that a mino axe will outdistance<br/>\n&gt;&gt; both the longsword and the combine longsword in damage. I recognize the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; speed advantage in giving better averaged damage in any one combat - but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; if you give the mino axe enough time, it will come out ahead. Instead of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; basing your weapon decision on ONE combat, base it on a lifetime.

I&#39;d much rather have the system check every<br/>\n </span></blockquote>3<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;seconds if I get an additional attack(s) than I would every 5 seconds.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;are arbitrary time factors, but you get the point. A longsword checks every<br/>\n&gt;29 units, to see if you swing twice, or use your secondary...a mino axe<br/>\n&gt;checks every 38 units. Probability is in favor of the faster weapon here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Before that time, lower offense/weapons skills mean you miss more. So,<br/>\n&gt;swinging more IS a good thing, be it one combat, or one hundred combats.<br/>\n&gt;Hitting a target has a large random component, stacking the odds more in<br/>\n&gt;your favor never hurts. Not to mention faster swings means faster skill<br/>\n&gt;increases, something not to be overlooked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When you jump the gap, and go to 2h weapons, well, they ARE more efficient.<br/>\n&gt;They have to be, to make up for the loss of either a shield or a secondary<br/>\n&gt;weapon, and are purpose designed to be the most devastating weapons in the<br/>\n&gt;game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You&#39;ll note also, that the &#39;good&#39; weapons break a couple of rules, they<br/>\n </span></blockquote>have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;higher base damage, and higher speed, with the level 40-50 stuff having<br/>\n&gt;damage numbers half that of their attack speed, more or less. You&#39;ll not be<br/>\n&gt;likely to see any weapons with more than .50 efficiency in players hands.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, to find the efficiency rating (as I call it) of a given weapon, divide<br/>\n&gt;its base damage by it&#39;s attack speed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3/20 Dagger .150<br/>\n&gt;4/23 Short Sword .170<br/>\n&gt;5/25 Rapier/Scimitar .200<br/>\n&gt;7/35 Battle Axe .200<br/>\n&gt;6/29 Longsword/Spear .206<br/>\n&gt;8/39 Bastard sword .205<br/>\n&gt;8/38 Mino axe .210,<br/>\n&gt;6/28 Combine longsword .214,<br/>\n&gt;5/23 Combine rapier .217,<br/>\n&gt;6/27 Combine spear .222<br/>\n&gt;7/28 Barbed leather whip .250,<br/>\n&gt;6/25 Stiletto of Bloodclaw .24,<br/>\n&gt;8/35 Screaming Mace .228<br/>\n&gt;12/43 Combine 2h .270<br/>\n&gt;14/50 Halberd .280<br/>\n&gt;14/43 Dwarven Greataxe/Bloodstained Sword .325<br/>\n&gt;16/35 Gigantic Zwiehander .457<br/>\n&gt;11/22 Fanged Skull Stiletto .50<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s just a listing of a weapon&#39;s optimum efficiency level. You&#39;ll note<br/>\n&gt;though, that a bastard sword is a hair worse than a longsword, a mino axe a<br/>\n&gt;hair better, and neither do as well as a combine longsword.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another calculation you can do, which gives you a better &#39;real world&#39;<br/>\n&gt;indication of how good a weapon is, is to determine a baseline weapon, I<br/>\n&gt;pick steel longswords, and compare damage over any given period of time. To<br/>\n&gt;do this, you take the attack speed, multiply it by the number of attacks<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;want, and then multiply that number by the base damage. Lets do 100 swings<br/>\n&gt;of a long sword. That takes 2900 (29 speed) time units, and yeilds 600<br/>\n&gt;(100*6) damage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, take a mino axe, divide its speed, 38, by 2900. That gives you 76.3,<br/>\n&gt;the amount of swings it will do in the same time period. Multiply that by<br/>\n </span></blockquote>8,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the base damage. In the time it takes a longsword to swing 100 times for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>600<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;damage, a mino axe swings 76, for 610. Ten points. Ten points in return for<br/>\n&gt;23.7% less chances to hit. To figure longer spans, just add some zeros. The<br/>\n&gt;gap widens a bit, 10x that time=100 more damage for the mino axe, but 240<br/>\n&gt;more swings with the longsword, and so on. With bonus damage for higher<br/>\n&gt;skills, the ratio is still the same.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A regular bastard sword fares even worse, doing 74 swings, and 594 damage.<br/>\n&gt;A combine longsword will do 103 swings, and 621 damage.<br/>\n&gt;A combine rapier will do 126 attacks, for 630 damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;A combine spear will do 107 attacks, and 644 damage.<br/>\n&gt;A screaming mace will do 82 swings, and 662 damage.<br/>\n&gt;A bloodclaw stiletto will do 116 attacks, for 696 damage.<br/>\n&gt;A barbed whip will do 103 swings, and 724 damage.<br/>\n&gt;A halberd will do 58 swings, and 812 damage.<br/>\n&gt;A 2h combine, 67 swings, 809 damage.<br/>\n&gt;A dwarven 2h greataxe or bloodstained sword will do 67 attacks, and 944<br/>\n&gt;damage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All of the above weapons are in the game, and in testers hands.

Information on these is widely held, so I<br/>\n&gt;won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;go into detail here.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First, let me say I measure the damage value of a weapon using a stat<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;called damage per second (dps). This is calculated assuming that the<br/>\n&gt;delay<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is in tenths of a sec (I think that&#39;s about right). To calculate:<br/>\n&gt; (damage<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;* 2) + 1 ) / (delay / 10)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please give me any info you have on any of these weapons, including<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;opinons on which is best, how hard they to obtain, how much they sell<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if sold, etc.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, if there are any missng from this list please add them. (There<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only 4 here). And two of those are not even confirmed as 1H slashing<br/>\n&gt;magic<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;weapons.  If they are not magic and 1H slashing then I am very much<br/>\n&gt;hoping<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am missing some good ones from this list.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Barbed Whip<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 7 / Delay 28 = 5.35 dps<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Found on the Bonrcrusher in Najena<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 6 / Delay 26 = 5 dps<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Casts berserker strnegth occasionally, but I don&#39;t know what this is.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Have no idea where it is found.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Crystalline Sword<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 11 / Delay 38 = 6.05 dps<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t even know if this is magical, but I have a feeling it is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t have any idea where to find it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t even know if it is 1H Slashing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Please help on this one, I like the stats!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cerrated Bone Dirk<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 9 / Delay Delay 26 = 7.3 dps!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t know if it is 1H slashing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t know if it magic<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I do know it is found on the Froglock Assasin in Guk Bottom<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just for comparison:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mino Axe<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 8 / Delay 37 = 4.59 dps<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dwarven Axe<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Damage 6 / Delay 26 = 5 dps<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Attention Star Wars fans!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ONElist is the best place for your Star Wars list!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Join today!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> and<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;select the Member Center link from the menu bar on the left.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription<br/>\n&gt;to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> and<br/>\n&gt;select the Member Center link from the menu bar on the left.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMake your voice heard!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nSign up for the ONElist Weekly Survey.
