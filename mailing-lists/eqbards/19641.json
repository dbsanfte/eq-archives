I was<br/>\nfloored.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry to hear this happened to you; I&#39;ve been victim of this line of<br/>\nthinking too.  In Mistmoore a few levels back, a post 40&#39;s Wizard was<br/>\ncamping Mynthi and created the nastiest trains I&#39;d seen up to that point.<br/>\nWe were camped out at the back of the lake, as far as you can get from any<br/>\noncoming trains.  He intentionally ran past us and since myself and the<br/>\nEnchanter in the group were alternately using AE songs/spells, the train<br/>\nderailed onto us.  A few heated words were exchanged in which he said it was<br/>\nhis prerogative to run wherever he liked.  Since no-one died that time we<br/>\ndecided to let it lie and went back to our spot.  Not ten minutes later he<br/>\ndid it again.  Exactly the same routine and ne&#39;ry a shout of &quot;Train!&quot;  This<br/>\ntime, however, 4 party members died.  I crossed the zone and found him on<br/>\nthe other side.  More words were exchanged and he made it clear that he<br/>\nthought it was perfectly acceptably to train his pursuers onto us since we&#39;d<br/>\ndistract a portion of the train long enough to enable him to escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s exactly what I was looking for.  /report &lt;lamewizzie&gt; quickly<br/>\nfollowed by /petition.  The foul language that peppered his half-assed<br/>\nopinion only served to damn him even further.  The GM I spoke to was kind<br/>\nenough to get back to me about a week later and told me that he&#39;d been<br/>\nsuspended pending a review of similar complaints.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sort of behaviour is inexcusable.  Just remember to /report<br/>\n&lt;playername&gt;  which sends a report to the GMs containing the last 10 lines<br/>\nof text in your window and follow it up by a /petition to explain the reason<br/>\nfor the /report.  The GMs are usually very efficient at dealing with these<br/>\nidiots.  The &quot;but I was roleplaying!&quot; excuse never washes with them. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-KS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
