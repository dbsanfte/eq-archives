It failed very often, more<br/>\noften than any song I&#39;ve had so far...I assume this means that it takes a<br/>\nlot of practice to get good at it.  By the time I reached ButcherBlock it<br/>\nwas failing less often so I guess I have improved at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the thing I noticed most was that I caught at least 3 times as many fish<br/>\nas I have ever caught before, with any character, while taking the boat!<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that this may be a statistical fluke, so I am asking everyone else<br/>\nto test this effect whenever they get a chance.  I know that I am going to<br/>\ntry singing every time I loot a corpse, to see if it will improve my yield.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tParalto</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
