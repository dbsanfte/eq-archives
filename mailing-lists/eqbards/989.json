How do you set up a hot key to switch from <br/>\ninstruments to weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried this many times and I never seem to get it to work.  The<br/>\nclosest I&#39;ve come is a back pack slot in my hot key box but i still<br/>\nneed to go into inventory mode to grab and put away the weapon /<br/>\ninstrument.  Im always afraid of dropping my Combine or shiny shield<br/>\nwhen I do this.  If any one can help it would be appreciated.
