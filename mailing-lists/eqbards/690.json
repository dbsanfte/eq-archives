After any weapon&#39;s special<br/>\neffect goes off bard songs get hosed. To fix it just hit any song 2 or more<br/>\ntimes until you get the &quot;You have not recovered yet&quot; message and that will<br/>\nfix it. The stuck icon on the screen will wear off and you can then cast<br/>\nsongs normally. It&#39;s annoying, but easy enough to get around that I would<br/>\nnever give up a weapon just because it did this.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaelin, Songweavers of Kelethin, Swinger of Tentacle Whips<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a> on 05/14/99 01:53:46 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n To:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>                                 <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n cc:      (bcc: Terry Chlebek/DPT)                            <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n Subject: Re: [eqbards] Digest Number 40                      <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember reading this somewhere.  Any weapon that cast a spell when you<br/>\nhit will also mess up your bard songs.  So stuff like the Granite Tomahawk<br/>\nand the screaming mace are absolute no nos to bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 14 May 1999, jay schultze wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;jay schultze&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I can confirm this one. Also, bard songs have some special &quot;Side<br/>\nEffects&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;times.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Some of these can be useful, some can be lethal. For example:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Root - While playing the Accelerando, root and similar spells that<br/>\ngenerate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the &quot;BOOT&quot; icon will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;             have no effect on you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I seem to remember that WHILE playing Accelerando it was possible for me<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; be rooted, BUT i could cancel the effect by stopping and restarting the<br/>\n&gt; song. I don&#39;t recall it ever making you immune to root. Correct if I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; wrong! =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another thing I found (to my dismay):  I was really excited when I got my<br/>\n&gt; Screaming Mace. I know a bard using blunt weapons may sound strange, but<br/>\nif &gt; you look at the stats the Screamer is like a magical mino axe - same<br/>\ndmg, &gt; same speed, hits magical, and BONUS random Strength from it&#39;s<br/>\nScream/Yaulp &gt; (I really liked this because you could stack it on top of<br/>\nEVERY other Str &gt; buff - I had like STR 175 or something with a shaman<br/>\nbuffing me, my strength &gt; songs, some magic items, and the Scream).<br/>\n&gt; Well - it all sounds good, but I found that the Screamer causes your<br/>\nsongs &gt; to go out of wack. When the Scream is in effect you can&#39;t sing. You<br/>\nstart a &gt; song and it immediately ends with no effect. So I had to get rid<br/>\nof my mace &gt; (sigh).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll post if I find that any other items cause this effect. Also would<br/>\n&gt; appreciate if any other bards have experienced anything like this with<br/>\nother &gt; magical items - it would be nice to post. It was rather irritating<br/>\nto find &gt; this out after getting all the required components for the mace<br/>\n(what a damn &gt; annoying quest).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sartori of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
