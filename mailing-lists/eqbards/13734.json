This pulls them out of the water about to the slope.<br/>\n&gt; Then you, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bard, engages, the druid snares, you fear and the tank comes<br/>\n&gt; running back to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get some licks in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Didn&#39;t work for us.  The caster was nuking the ranger<br/>\n&gt; (puller), so he ran out of range.  The caster then started<br/>\n&gt; nuking the paladin who had healed the ranger, so he ran out of<br/>\n&gt; range.  The caster then started nuking the bard, so he ran out<br/>\n&gt; of range.  Then the caster started nuking me, who wasn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; grouped with them.  It seemed given a choice between chasing<br/>\n&gt; someone and nuking someone already in range, the goblin would<br/>\n&gt; usually nuke.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
