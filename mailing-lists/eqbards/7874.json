The items where given to my bard by her<br/>\nhusband and his brother (both about 10 lvls higher).  My enchanter was twicked by<br/>\nher Mom and Dad (the bard & her hubby), as was her brother (&quot;hubby&#39;s&quot; 2nd char).<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I feel this is improper, No.  I know VERY few people who have never given a<br/>\ngift to a lover or child.  I have also seen very few &quot;trophy wives&quot; who where not<br/>\ngiven expensive gifts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do however expect that the younger wife would try to find gifts for her &quot;man who<br/>\nhas everything&quot;, and the child to make a gift for Mommy & Daddy.  My bard is<br/>\nalways searching vendors for magic Word to give to her magician, and when the Ench<br/>\nis older, I suppect she will give gifts to her parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwinking, maybe.  Trade over a very long time period, maybe.  This is just the<br/>\ngame version of: Do I give the homeless guy on the street a dollar, or do I think<br/>\nhe&#39;ll just drink it.  Should I give money/time to a charity, am I sure I support<br/>\ntheir goals?<br/>\n<br/>\nI will keep giving money to the Red Cross and American Cancer Society, but pretend<br/>\nI don&#39;t see the bum; and I will help characters I know are trying to play the<br/>\ngame, and tell the beggers (guild or otherwise) off, publicly so other people<br/>\nrealize how they &quot;play&quot; the game.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
