I&#39;ve been killed twice playing Lullaby to<br/>\nhelp newbies.  First time was at the bandit camp in GFay, and<br/>\na wandering guard whacked me from behind.  The second time was<br/>\nin Butcherblock.  I positioned myself so that a merchant was<br/>\nwell out of the range I&#39;d figured for Discord via<br/>\nexperimentation, and hit Lullaby.  Either my estimate was<br/>\nwrong or Lullaby&#39;s range is bigger than Discord.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
