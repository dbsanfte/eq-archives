Still<br/>\ntook the faction hit though.  You need to have the invis song though for<br/>\nthis to work.  Also, I recommend against doing this quest now.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink any class but an enchanter can complete it with the recent patch<br/>\nbecause the some of the quest items are now NO DROP.  If you still want to<br/>\nknow how to do it, see below for spoiler:<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler space<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStand along the side where the three NPCs are.  Look for the fish and<br/>\nobserve its path.  It follows the same path every time.  About halfway down<br/>\nthe pool, it turns around and starts over.  Get into the pool at that<br/>\nlocation.  Make sure you are behind the column so the guard in the pool<br/>\ncan&#39;t see you.  Equip your lute and sing underwater breathing song.  When<br/>\nfish nears turnaround point, melee attack.  Don&#39;t use bellow or chords.  The<br/>\nguard in the pool did not attack me when I did it this way.  When you kill<br/>\nthe fish, start singing Invis song.  When I got out of the pool, a guard<br/>\nwalked right by me and did not attack.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had heard a rumor that you can fish for an extended period of time & get<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; Koalindl fish.  Just wanted to let everyone know I tested this.  After<br/>\n&gt; catching<br/>\n&gt; about 80 fish & assorted daggers & old shoe, I DID NOT catch a Koalindl<br/>\n&gt; fish.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also I was not killed by the Paladin (thought he was not fond of me), but<br/>\n&gt; by a<br/>\n&gt; militia Corporal, after I did kill the fish.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
