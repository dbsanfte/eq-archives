It ALWAYS has worked for me, regardless of whether the<br/>\nroot was on ME, or ANY of my party!!   I think this is a GREAT benefit, and<br/>\nhope Verant does not remove it &quot;as a bug&quot;. I&#39;ve had 2 or 3 members of my<br/>\nparty rooted, all of them shouting &quot;rooted!&quot; and then I throw the song up,<br/>\nALL are released at the same time!  The many &quot;Thank you&#39;s&quot;  I receive make<br/>\nme feel like a valuable member of the team!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for mutliple bards, I have frequently travelled with one other bard in a<br/>\ngroup. We always work out a &quot;you play these songs because you are higher<br/>\nlevel, I play these&quot; routine, and it works well unless something bad happens<br/>\nto one of us in combat (one of us dies, one of us forced to zone, etc).  My<br/>\nDREAM is to travel with a party full of SIX bards on day, if even for a<br/>\nshort time. THAT would be a lot of fun! heheheh!<br/>\n<br/>\nTallonn Stringfellow - Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Randy Varnell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rvarnell@...\">rvarnell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;; EQBards &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, June 22, 1999 2:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Educating the masses<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Randy Varnell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rvarnell@...\">rvarnell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Last night Roop (a fellow bard) and I were grouping with a party in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Highhold<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Pass fighting orcs.

Any confirmation on this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, you&#39;re absolutely right about multiple bards in a group. Also, an<br/>\n&gt;entire group of bards is pretty interesting in a fight when you get to the<br/>\n&gt;lvl 15 and above range. You MUST coordinate your songs, but if you take the<br/>\n&gt;time to do so, you can do some amazing things in combat. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
