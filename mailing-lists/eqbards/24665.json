Inside the guild, I<br/>\nthink the system is mainly who needs (doesn&#39;t have something as good or<br/>\nbetter), then who can or will use, and if none of those 2 apply, it gets<br/>\nopen lottoed. I personally won&#39;t put in on a lotto unless it is something I<br/>\nwill actively use. The reason we&#39;re discussing loot rules is we do alot of<br/>\nraids with other guilds and there has been some discussion between the<br/>\nguilds about how it&#39;s done. I think the issue is more about folks walking in<br/>\n5 minutes before the God mob dies and winning lottos. Being loot happy does<br/>\ncount against you in VS and Excalibur. Both those guilds will quickly point<br/>\nyou to the Xegony guild that is famous for that.<br/>\nAs to Bards, we were leaving CoM a few weeks ago and a couple of guilds were<br/>\ndoing some lottos of dragon drops in EJ. They were using shout/ooc. The<br/>\nleader made a statement that bards were ineligible for haste items. I<br/>\nmentioned something about &#39;remind me never to help that guild do anything&#39;<br/>\nto my cleric. He was really incensed that anyone would exclude a bard on a<br/>\nhaste item. His comment to the zone was along the lines of never piss off<br/>\nyour bards since you depend on them for so many things. I myself have a sash<br/>\nof Dragonborne. I got it by default in HS by being the only melee in the<br/>\ngroup that didn&#39;t have a similar item. The group didn&#39;t bother to lotto it,<br/>\njust told me to pick it up. We also hand stuff around. My cleric has lottoed<br/>\nfor anf won 2 shields off dragons. The second one he liked better and gave<br/>\nhis first one to our shaman friend. He won a scale for the green BP from<br/>\nWooshi. When he got his Donal&#39;s bp shortly after, the green BP went to the<br/>\nshaman also.<br/>\nMy luck is so good at lottoing, I even won the &#39;who gets to be the key<br/>\ncorpse&#39; lotto last night! Took the enchanter forever to kill me!<br/>\n<br/>\nGratz Gilgurth and Elfson!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe (trudging oh so slowly towards 57)<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
