He stated he did not think Verant was maliciously screwing over bards.  Instead, he thinks that they are a bunch of idiots who have no idea what they are doing in regards to bards.  So he is no longer going to worry about trying to use logic, statistical analysis, etc. to fight for improvements to the bard class since they don&#39;t have a clue what they are doing.  Thats the way I interpreted his post.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 11, 2000 10:08 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Abashi finally responds... sort of<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nno, that&#39;s not me.  of course kaearia posted on the concert hall that he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave a lot of problems with the way verant is handling the issues either, at least<br/>\nwith regard to gordon&#39;s monster post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
