The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2008830540\">Just curious, but what did you do when you logged in and all your guild<br/>\nenchanters were busy in other groups post 55? Any hints on where you<br/>\nplayed around? The only &quot;pickup&quot; groups I play in are put together<br/>\nmostly from guild members, and when there&#39;s no enchanter, the places to<br/>\ngo at 55+ are pretty slim. I can go solo in Tim Deep, or team up with<br/>\ncasters in Skyfire, or try to put something together in Karnors or<br/>\nSebilis. But Karnors is getting green and if the 3 easy spots in Sebilis<br/>\nare taken, without an enchanter it&#39;s pretty slim pickings. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Oct 11/00, &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; both sides are strong arguments, and both jeff and kitasi are definitely on<br/>\n&gt; oppopsite sides of the spectrum, with a lot of us somewhere in between.  i<br/>\n&gt; think kitasi&#39;s gripe is not that he is &quot;always grouped with enchanter,<br/>\n&gt; cleric, AND snarer&quot; but that most players want to be or refuse to play<br/>\n&gt; otherwise.  i haven&#39;t run into these problems because i am lucky not to<br/>\n&gt; ever, ever, ever be in pick-up groups.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y* </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
