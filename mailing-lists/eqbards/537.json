Once you <br/>\nattain base standing with Stormguard (dwarven guards) from killing orcs, etc <br/>\nYou can do this quest.  A warrior dwarf in the way back of the warrior guild <br/>\nin Kaladim will offer it, asking if you are Ready to serve, just say Yes I <br/>\nam ready to serve and he&#39;ll tell you to get belts from orc cents in CB.  He <br/>\ngives little exp, faction, and 3 to 4 sp and an item ranging from a bandage <br/>\nto a 2 gp gem.  Very nice considering you&#39;ll probably run over there once <br/>\nyou have like 30 some odd belts saved up.  Imagine this as a secondary drum <br/>\nquest for later lvls.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the large tattered pad part of that quest seems to be broken for now, <br/>\nso don&#39;t waste your pads on it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBryne<br/>\n10th circle<br/>\nSongweaver<br/>\nBertoxx<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve just arrived in Kaladim on my way to Kelethin and I&#39;m looking to make<br/>\na little coin. What is this Belt Quest that you speak of? Would a Bard of<br/>\nthe Seventh Circle be able to complete it?Journeyman Plastos<br/>\nAt 08:51 PM 05/06/1999 PDT, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
