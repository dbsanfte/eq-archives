She was upper 20&#39;s so no mana song<br/>\n... but the three Necros and the Shaman were pacting/cannablizing<br/>\n(respectively thier hp to mana lines).  The Shaman and Druid were trading<br/>\noff tanking ... I was a reserve tank (yes - both could out tank poor<br/>\nwood-elf me).  Our downtime was quite minimal - usually the Druid went low<br/>\nmana healing himself after tanking out a DoT kill.   We were doing<br/>\nyellow/red gnolls as fast as we could find them.  So yes - hymm to mana with<br/>\nno Clarity even but with a shaman/necro heavy group worked nicely.
