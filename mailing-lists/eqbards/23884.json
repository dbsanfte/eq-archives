He was on lute with Dissonance(2) Cessation (48) and Cantana (55).  I<br/>\nwas on drum doing the 3 chants.  After finding some of the mobs had high<br/>\nresists to one of the chants (fire I think) I had a flip through the list of<br/>\nother drum based songs and pulled out Wee.  The fights were taking a bit<br/>\nlonger but betwee the DA and healing from Cantana (well more so the healing<br/>\nfrom Cantana) we would end the fights at full health.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou just never know when... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJacana Mourningsong<br/>\nWood Elf Minstrel<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
