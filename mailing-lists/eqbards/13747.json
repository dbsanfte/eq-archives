Sadly I was grouped with a group of casters and tanks the other night<br/>\nkilling Seafury Cyclops.  The rogue in our group just *would not* lay off<br/>\nthe Backstab button.  He was routinely getting pounded by the clops<br/>\nsignificantly worse than the rest of us, and the problem was that *I* was<br/>\nthe primary healer.  So after a fight the rogue would be at two bubbles of<br/>\nhealth and the rest of us are down maybe one at most.  So now the whole<br/>\ngroup is waiting several minutes on the rogue to heal after fights.  So as<br/>\npolitely as I know how I asked him to maybe not BS anymore - of course he<br/>\ngot pissed that I was telling him how to run his class.  /sigh<br/>\n<br/>\n[44 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I have to agree with Athren.  A player (of any type) who jumps<br/>\n&gt; into battle with<br/>\n&gt; guns a-blazin&#39; and doesn&#39;t know when to back off is one of the<br/>\n&gt; more annoying<br/>\n&gt; player types to have to group with.  This is particularly true in<br/>\n&gt; any party with<br/>\n&gt; a healing shortage.  By judiciously backing out when I start to<br/>\n&gt; attract too much<br/>\n&gt; attention, I&#39;ve cut my personal death rate enormously (5 in six<br/>\n&gt; levels, all due<br/>\n&gt; to other groups&#39; trains), which, IMHO, is a big benefit to any<br/>\n&gt; party.  If they<br/>\n&gt; have to try to continue without me, or wait for me to return,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s a lot worse<br/>\n&gt; for them than getting a bit less assistance from me in any one<br/>\n&gt; particular fight.<br/>\n&gt;  (And it&#39;s more fun for me, too.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve also learned to make more liberal use of:<br/>\n&gt; /g RUN<br/>\n&gt; &lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Those &quot;glorious&quot;<br/>\n&gt; everyone-down-to-one-bubble-surrounded-by-a-pile-of-dead-MOBs<br/>\n&gt; fights do not make up for the far more frequent 2-people-deads.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 40 songs, Innoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
