Perhaps it&#39;s <br/>\njust me, but we seem to never lack for a tank of some sort, meaning I rarely <br/>\nhave to go up there and become the meat shield. I&#39;m not saying this never <br/>\nhappens, but as you put it, it&#39;s occasional. Thus, I can&#39;t consider this my <br/>\nmain job... My main job is making that tank better at what he does. No <br/>\nenchanter? Of course I handle crowd-control, however, that&#39;s not my main job <br/>\neither. When we do have an enchanter (and lately, I&#39;ve been grouping with <br/>\nenchanters more and more - perhaps they&#39;re more readily available at higher <br/>\nlevels?) I can make his job a lot easier by coordinating with him/her, and I <br/>\nfeel I can make that enchanter a much better one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t think that the bard tends to &quot;fade away&quot; in large raids... <br/>\nPerhaps it depends what you&#39;re raiding, but off the top of my head, our MR <br/>\nsongs alone are indispensible. Even in a group with two tanks, an enchanter, <br/>\na cleric, and a &lt;fill in the blank here&gt;, a bard is a welcome addition due <br/>\nto our many talents. True, there are no deficient spots to fill, but those <br/>\nmembers of the group are now much more efficient with a bard along, as is <br/>\nthe group as a whole. We&#39;re able to pull quicker, have less down-time, and <br/>\nkill quicker than that same group would have been able to without the added <br/>\nbard.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonnett<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Jeffrey Sue &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Soloing bards<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2001 15:43:04 -0800<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 10:43 PM 1/30/01 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;I&#39;ll leave the serious damage dealing to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tanks and casters.

Mind if I quote you on that the next time I&#39;m having <br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;argument with someone? ;) I&#39;ve always felt the same way you do - my main<br/>\n&gt; &gt;job, as a bard, is to make everyone better at their jobs. Yes, perhaps my<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;i see my main job as a bard as filling in the gaps, which is a little <br/>\n&gt;different from<br/>\n&gt;making everyone better at their jobs.  occasionally you will be in groups <br/>\n&gt;without<br/>\n&gt;real damage dealers and you will have to step in and deal that damage.  <br/>\n&gt;this is<br/>\n&gt;why the bard is so powerful in an unbalanced group (i.e. missing certain <br/>\n&gt;components)<br/>\n&gt;as compared to balanced groups.  also why the bard seems to fade away in <br/>\n&gt;big<br/>\n&gt;raids (regardless of ubermob or not) because most big raids are by <br/>\n&gt;definition, balanced.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;value in a group isn&#39;t as apparent as the wizards&#39;s after he blasts a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;beastie for 500 damage, or the cleric&#39;s after he heals someone for 500 <br/>\n&gt;hit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;points... but I feel that what I add to the group, is, in some cases,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;invaluable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sonnett<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;Lifekeepers&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
