If the other group was fighting multiple<br/>\nmobs and only dealing damage to one (as they probably should), then the<br/>\nother mob could easily be pulled off by your song.  Once the mob jumped<br/>\nyou, you started playing your songs the best you know how.  Anthem or Heal<br/>\nor whatever song you play is not only pulsing on you, but also on every PC<br/>\naround you.  While your songs don&#39;t affect PCs not in your group, they<br/>\nstill put you on the hate list for the mob (and faction adjustments).  If<br/>\nyou are surrounded by your group and the other group, the mob sees you<br/>\nbuffing 12 PCs.  Nothing will get the mob off you as long as you keep<br/>\nplaying your songs like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are also other factors that can make you believe in &quot;bard hate&quot;.<br/>\nZones are buggy.  Songs can go through walls, unlimited z-axis, and<br/>\nsometimes all the way to the other side of the zone.  And many zones have<br/>\npathing problems.  You may be affecting mobs and not even know it.  Five<br/>\nminutes later, the mob may have finally found a way to you.  It will run<br/>\npast other people who are not on it&#39;s hate list until it gets to you.  You<br/>\nmight not have even been playing your songs for several minutes.  Of course<br/>\nyou will think that it is Bard Hate, but there is no such thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a bard&#39;s song that cause monsters to attack, not just being a bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
