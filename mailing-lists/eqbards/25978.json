Figures they<br/>\nwould not put in any effort to make the damage portion of our songs<br/>\nstack w/o having the debuff portion stack.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone had a chance to yet locate the new level 58 song?  The patch<br/>\nmessage makes it look like it will be a quest??<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder off what uber mob the ancient songs will drop.  Lcea<br/>\nwould be the logical candidate but she doesn&#39;t seem to be difficult<br/>\nenough for a mob to drop ancient songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosha &quot;Spellsinger&quot; Cristi<br/>\nLvl 60<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
