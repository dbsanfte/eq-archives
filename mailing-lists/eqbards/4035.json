He actually spawns pretty often (once<br/>\nevery hour maybe). He started conning blue to me at lvl 9, but I did not see<br/>\nhim again until I was ten. It was not a fast fight, but I survived and got<br/>\nhis head.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw Zarcoomi last night for the first time in a long while. I think she<br/>\nonly spawns once daily. I was with a 10th lvl rogue and when I spotted an<br/>\nogre across the BB plains I hit Selo&#39;s and went chasing. She conned blue to<br/>\nme (11th lvl now) but she is a spell caster so you have to be a little<br/>\ncareful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all in was not a whole lot of work/peril. I think the hardest part<br/>\nwas just finding Zarcoomi at the right place right time. Fortunately BB is a<br/>\nbig zone, and if you spot her, or Corflunk you can probably have them<br/>\nwithout a swarm of other folks hoping in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Elena Glenn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:braveheart@...\">braveheart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 1:46 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Center of attention<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Elena Glenn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:braveheart@...\">braveheart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have heard that price before on the Xegony server.

I&#39;ve played bards in AD&D for about as long<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have been playing, only to have other people that I RPG with snigger and<br/>\n&gt; ask<br/>\n&gt; &gt;why I would want to. EQ, like some of the other MUD&#39;s I have played over<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;years, really does a good job at making the bard fun to play. It&#39;s great<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt;randomly group with people who say things like &quot;You bards kick ass&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Travelling with a bard in the party is a pleasure.&quot; Now if we could just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;charm lots of mobs at lower levels I&#39;d be in heaven.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Okay on to more serious business. I completed the Ogre Head Quest in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Butcherblock last night by dropping off the heads of two named Ogres<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(Corflunk and Zarcoomi) to Byzar Bloddforge in Kaladim. As a reward I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;received a Blackened Iron Crown<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Blackened.Iron.Crown.html)\">http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Blackened.Iron.Crown.html)</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;which I thought was pretty nifty. This morning I was browsing Everlore<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;someone had remarked that this item had been sold at auction for 250pp. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;just about passed out with dreams of avarice. Anyone have an idea if this<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;even near to being true? If so I am camping in BB for a while longer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bernwyn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Balladeer or the 11th Verse, small trinkets dealer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 12:18 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [eqbards] Center of attention<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, one thing I like about this group is you all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actually LIKE playing a bard.  That may sound silly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but a lot of message boards out there are just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; whinning about the class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, I had heard about the &#39;tauting&#39; effects of our<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; songs, but for the most part, it never bothered me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sure I get the mobs attention, and even take a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dammage, no biggie, just make nice with the cleric.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, after turning 21, Guk and Unrest have become<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; whole new places.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; First guk, near the scryer room my party of six where<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bashing every froglock in sight, gaining massive exp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and loot.  So we say, what the heck, lets go in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; room.  Well, on knight comes after us, so I use my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; melodic binding song that I love so much.  Big<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mistake, from behind one of our tanks I saw no less<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; than 15 assorted froglocks come up the stairs, and who<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; do you think they were headed for?  Well, after about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 5 minutes of root, root, root, root, I was taking the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; long walk back from freeport.  Get back, grab my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stuff, play anthem for my friends in battle, and what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; do you think happened?  Again, I&#39;m dragged down under<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a sea of amphibious flesh.  So after a while, I say,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; heck, I&#39;ll head over to good ole unrest, what could be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; safer?  Get there, find some good friends I could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; trust, and we get to slayin undead.  One of the dry<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bones makes a run for the house, silly bard that I am,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I chase him, again, still singing a song, forget which<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one.  Withing seconds the doors fly open and carrion,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; monks and the reclusive ghoul magi beeline right at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the wide eyed me, who didn&#39;t even have time to type in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a profanity.  So I come back from butchers block.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Fighting a while, see a wisp to the left of the house,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; facing the back.  Someone in my guild needed a light<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stone, so I run to grab it, while singing my little<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; anthem.  All of a sudden, the hag 3 floors up starts<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; casting on me from a window, and I wake up at home<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; among the trees.  That sucked.  Does this mean we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; can&#39;t use any of our aoe or buffs anywhere near a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dungeon?  Well, at least my calves are built up from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; zone running :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Llewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 21rst song<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; E Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist<br/>\nSponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The Best Place to Buy Movies - Reel.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Get $20 off all MotherNature brand products!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mothernature1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mothernature1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your anytime, anywhere sports store.
