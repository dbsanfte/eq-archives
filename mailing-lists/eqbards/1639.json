I told<br/>\nhim I&#39;d never heard of it, and remarked it sounded as if a &quot;cracked&quot; flute<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t work every well.  He told me it was involved with a quest, but<br/>\nbefore I could get any more information out of him his party group gated<br/>\naway.  Wondering if this is a broken flute for some quest delivery, or<br/>\nperhaps something nice to have.  Think the fellow wondered the same thing,<br/>\nprobably would have sold it to me for 200 pp or some such nonsense.  He was<br/>\nhigh-level, so may be a higher level quest?
