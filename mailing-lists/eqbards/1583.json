I was just curious if anybody had specific<br/>\n&gt; stats on the damage done using Denons Disruptive Cord. Also, does the<br/>\n&gt; damage inflicted increase with your level, your brass skill or both. I<br/>\n&gt; overheard  a 21 level bard say that she does 79 hp worth of damage with<br/>\n&gt; this song per pulse when using her horn. I failed to ask her how she<br/>\n&gt; arrived at this figure, but now that I have the song (which does work<br/>\n&gt; pretty good), I wish I had.
