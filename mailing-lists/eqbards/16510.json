I seem to recall GZ<br/>\nstating that Solon&#39;s was intentionally coded so that singing another song<br/>\nwith it would interrupt it.  Then again maybe they&#39;ll let up on that since<br/>\nthis _is_ an over-50 song.  I like the idea but I doubt they&#39;ll let us have<br/>\na song that is _THAT_ useful.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A new charm song, if not full charm then atleast a charm animal song<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(make<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; this one 44th or 49th)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Charm animal is utterly useless (and pointless) for a bard.  90% of the<br/>\n&gt; zones we go to do not have animals high enough to bother with.

But I&#39;d rather not give<br/>\nVerant the idea to give us _just_ charm animal.  We _deserve_ an upgrade to<br/>\nour current _unrestricted_ charm.  Why accept something less?  If you think<br/>\nabout it there are FAR more places _without_ lvl 37+ animals than places<br/>\nwith them.  I&#39;d rather not have yet another song that I will rarely use when<br/>\nI already have one that&#39;s better :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Niv&#39;s Chrorus of Restoration<br/>\n&gt; &gt; String Required<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2xHymn of Restoration + Fatigue restoral + 1.5xCassindra&#39;s Chorus of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Clarity.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Fully stacks with Hymn of Restoration, Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity,<br/>\n&gt; Niv&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Melody of Preservation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Interesting but I think this would be far too powerful.  twice hymn + jig<br/>\n </span></blockquote>+<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; clarity?  uhh.... and stackable?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hymn x 2 at 50th would = 35 a tick healing.
