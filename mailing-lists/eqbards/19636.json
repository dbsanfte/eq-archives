My guild<br/>\ndecided to do a little hunting in City of Mists.  So we headed there and<br/>\nsetup camp for about 8 hours straight.  In this time period we had broken<br/>\na corner of a dungeon really nicely and were basically pulling non-stop.<br/>\nAs we all know the rare drops are random on all of the creature types in<br/>\nthe zone.  So for the whole time I was there we got a grand total of 0<br/>\ndrops common or uncommmon.  However to make things more interesting a<br/>\ngroup was camped by the entrance for about 1 hour and got about 5 drops in<br/>\nthat time period..... talk about random =(.  And they got that bard dagger<br/>\nwhich was even more annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
