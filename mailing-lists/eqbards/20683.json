I&#39;ve got a<br/>\n&gt; GeForce DDR on a P3V4X mobo (Via Apollo Pro) with a P3-800 and it runs<br/>\n&gt; without problems.  There&#39;s not much to choose from a GeForce DDR and a<br/>\n&gt; GeForce2 GTS at lower resolutions (anthing less than 1024x768).

The biggest problem with ANY Voodoo card, however is<br/>\nheat.  The GeForce cards are nowhere near as hot as their Voodoo<br/>\ncounterparts.  Not sure why, maybe their technology is just that much better<br/>\n(Nvidia).  Pluss I would NEVER use a Via chipset until they can outperform<br/>\nthe BX-440 chipset by intel which is now over 3 years old and still beats<br/>\nthe Via chipset hands down in any configuration.  And if you overclock the<br/>\nBX-440 to 133mhz it&#39;s still more stable and reliable (though it wreaks havok<br/>\nwith older video cards).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem isn&#39;t your GeForce card.  It&#39;s your BIOS Rev and some inherent<br/>\npower problems with the Via Chipset.  As was mentioned you might want to try<br/>\nflashing your bios to the latest Rev.  That should help a lot.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
