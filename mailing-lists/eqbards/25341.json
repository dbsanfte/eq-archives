I would guess that others do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, BotB and PvP is different.  Other factors come into play and there<br/>\nis ample room for even good players to make mistakes - mistakes which can be<br/>\nvery costly. <br/>\n<br/>\nThird, some people will enter the competition even thought they &quot;know&quot; that<br/>\nthey can&#39;t win. For some, there is pride and honor in competeing - no matter<br/>\nwhat the outcome is. I have a great deal of respect for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of all that, we all know that this game rewards you for the amount of<br/>\ntime that spend doing the &quot;right stuff&quot; (gaining levels, getting good gear -<br/>\nand in Thott&#39;s case *building* a powerful guild dedicated to these things to<br/>\nmake them happen a lot faster.)  Best of the Best - is gonna be the contest<br/>\nfor those who did these things.  And it is by no means &quot;simple&quot; to spend a<br/>\nlot of time playing with a guild of most dedicated players not to mention<br/>\nleading a guild like this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I am misunderstanding you, and the &quot;sour grapes&quot; or envy that I<br/>\ndetect in your comments is only in my imagination.  In any case, Verant does<br/>\nalso host contests where &quot;the playing field is level&quot; - look at the<br/>\ngladiator tournement they hosted at Gencon where you competed with<br/>\nidentically leveled and equipped characters.  And yes, I think they should<br/>\nreward the players who choose to play the game for its other aspects (role<br/>\nplaying) as well as the power gamers who got all the best gear.  But I see<br/>\nno point in degrading one contest just because there are better ones that<br/>\ncould & should be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertain things are fundamental to this game: level and gear.  This contest<br/>\nis all about that.  Other contests and events can be designed to focus on<br/>\nthe other aspects. I think it would would be entertaining and challenging to<br/>\nhave a tourney where the GM DT&#39;s each contestant and they are given the same<br/>\ngear (or 1 sword and a shield, or choice of a generic Slashing, Piercing or<br/>\nBlunt wep) to compete with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nImho, Thott is hugely successful at this game and I think he has justly<br/>\nearned his success.  It is more than just putting in the hours and being in<br/>\nthe most powerful guild on your server.  If that were all there is to it, I<br/>\n(with my 250+ days played and 20 months in a power gamer guild) would be in<br/>\nthe oober guild rather than one that can barely muster 2 groups and has<br/>\ntrouble killing a level 56 mob. But that&#39;s not all that I play the game for<br/>\n(level & gear) - I get most of my fun from the interaction with people and<br/>\nworking together to slay dragons or kill moss snakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow - that&#39;s my humble opinion,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nVirtuoso<br/>\n&lt;Mercenary Force&gt;<br/>\nSomewhere on Innoruuk... <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mercenaryforce.com\">http://www.mercenaryforce.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: RKR [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rkroads@...\">rkroads@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 06, 2001 9:38 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] RE: Bard BOTB<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what Shada (retired) doesn&#39;t say outright is that there is no point for<br/>\nanyone to enter the &quot;BoB&quot; besides Aftathott.
