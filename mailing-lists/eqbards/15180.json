Overcrowding is so ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1143059724\">I just got my mask the other day, being it was only the 2nd real time I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen in LGuk (first was to get the Lambent Quest items).  Overcrowding is so<br/>\nunbearable there that I found other places to hunt.  In your case, the<br/>\novercrowdedness works in your favor... you probably have a decent chance of<br/>\nwalking unscathed all the way from the dead side entrance to the assassin<br/>\nroom.  People down there are extremelly nice about the mask.  I was unlucky<br/>\nenough to get there on a night when 3 people were already in line to loot<br/>\nit.  (The Bard ahead of me was level 15)  About 20 mins before I was<br/>\nplanning to log for the night I got the tell saying that mine was there!<br/>\n<br/>\nCouple of suggestions...<br/>\nGet a map.  A GREAT guide to lguk is at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://monks.volitionx.com/\">http://monks.volitionx.com/</a>  The<br/>\nmaps are kind of confusing in certain areas due to the multi-levels of the<br/>\ndungeon so be careful.  You will have to climb a ladder to enter the room<br/>\n(it&#39;s not depicted on the map)<br/>\n<br/>\nGet Invis to Undead.  If you have a friend that can cast Invis to Undead and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mind blowing a few hours you&#39;re much better off.  Most people are<br/>\nreally cool about giving out invis to undead (I guess it&#39;s either be nice<br/>\nabout it, or suffer the trains... :), but for what you&#39;re there for, I&#39;d try<br/>\nto be as unneedy as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo naked.  You probably won&#39;t be joining the assassin group, just patiently<br/>\nwaiting in the room, so if something bad does happen, you&#39;re free to give up<br/>\nand try again later.  Maybe bring extra food and water for the group camping<br/>\nthat room... extra plat to trade for their gold?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would shout upon entering the zone to find out who is camping the<br/>\nAssassin, then ask politely in tells if they mind you not only looting, but<br/>\nsitting in the room while you wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Assassin or PlaceHolder spawns every 35 - 40 minutes, so you could have<br/>\na long wait.. especially if there&#39;s already a line for the mask.  But, it is<br/>\nthe common drop, so the first Assassin that pops, most likely is carrying<br/>\nit. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this info helps.  I know the guide definately will. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello all!<br/>\n&gt; I have been reading this list for about 3 months now and thanks to you all<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a level 15 half-bard and am absolutly loving him. This is a very<br/>\nhelpful,fun, and informative list. Seeing that I just reached 15 I would<br/>\nlove to try on a mask of deception. I looked through the archives and did<br/>\nnot find much. Would anyone please point me in the way of current info on<br/>\nthis or maybe give me some suggestions as I take on the mission for it this<br/>\nweekend. I know that basically I need to find my way down to lower guk and<br/>\nask to loot it off the ghoul assassin there that it is a common drop on. I&#39;m<br/>\nscared to death though. Should I go naked and maybe bring a mandolin to sing<br/>\nheal for a group? Any advice would be awesome.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A fellow bard who feels at home thanks to all the advice that this list<br/>\n </span></blockquote>pours into my inbox each day,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Indykah --&gt; 15songs on Erollisi Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
