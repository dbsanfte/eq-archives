My main<br/>\ncuriosity is - why can&#39;t you increase these numbers with skill points?<br/>\nAnd/or why don&#39;t they also go up like your skills do as you get older and<br/>\nmore experienced? It doesn&#39;t make sense to me that a newly born Bard at<br/>\nlevel 1 will have the same strength as he/she would at level 50. What, it&#39;s<br/>\nnot logical that he/she would gain more strength as he/she got older and<br/>\nmatured? Would the Bard (or any other class) not be able to go to their<br/>\nguild and maybe study something that would make them more intelligent? Could<br/>\nthe Bard not go to their guild and train in the ways of interacting with<br/>\npeople to improve their CHR scores? See what I&#39;m getting at?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think of say a Warrior that has the same strength fighting little decaying<br/>\nskeletons as he will when he&#39;s fighting Lady Vox and it&#39;s just plain silly.<br/>\nI&#39;d love to see Verrant make it so that you could spend you skill points in<br/>\nmodifiers as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
