If it worked like it did in AD&D,<br/>\nfine, that would be one thing.  The problem is not that a class is slower to<br/>\nlevel, but rather that having a hybrid in your group makes the whole group<br/>\nlevel slower.  This unfairly penalizes your group members for what is<br/>\nsupposed to be your penalty.<br/>\nWhen a kill is made, every member of the party is not given an equal number<br/>\nof xp points.  No, every member is given a percentage of the total xp based<br/>\non how much xp they currently have.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets take the most extreme example.  A group of 5 troll shadow knights<br/>\n(highest xp penalty) and 1 halfling rogue (lowest xp penalty).  Lets assume<br/>\nthey&#39;re all the same level and they kill a monster worth 600xp.  Now you<br/>\nthink the intelligent thing would be to give each member of the group 100xp<br/>\neach, but no, that&#39;s not how it works.  In this example, each troll SK would<br/>\nget 108xp, and the poor halfling rogue would get 55xp.  The logic is that<br/>\nthe halfling needs less xp to level, so he gets less.  The problem is that<br/>\nthis system totally eliminates the idea of having a class that&#39;s easier to<br/>\nlevel.  The poor little halfling got screwed by the hybrids in his group.<br/>\nReplace all those troll SK&#39;s with non-hybrids, and suddenly our halfling is<br/>\ngetting twice the xp, and leveling twice as fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow granted, this is an extreme example, but every time you add a hybrid to<br/>\nyour group, the ability of the group to level quickly is decreased.  So you<br/>\ntell me, who pays the penalty?  Hybrids?  Or those forced to group with<br/>\nthem?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn<br/>\nLevel 58 Hybrid Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.

It&#39;s not a &quot;penalty&quot; it&#39;s just harder to level certain<br/>\nclasses than it is to level others.  This is due to varying benefits that<br/>\neach class has.   Go look at an AD&D players handbook and look at the xp<br/>\ndifferences for each class.  If you look in a 1st Edition one you can even<br/>\nlook at bards and realize that they are the single hardest class in AD&D to<br/>\nlevel (had to level to 10 in warrior, 10 in thief then switch to bard and<br/>\nlevel on an xp curve comparable to that of a paladin.).<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
