If there is a better song<br/>\nto play, tell us what it is.  Just because some other class has a better<br/>\ndamage shield, that is not a reason to just instantly dismiss bard&#39;s damage<br/>\nshield songs. Also depending on the level of the bard -  there might not be<br/>\nthat many other better options.  You can be 31 and be in assn room or you<br/>\ncan be 44 - big difference in what your choices are. <br/>\n<br/>\nPoint is, he gave us a specific situation, I answered with some points about<br/>\nthe specific songs.  Please share, but be specific about what songs a - say<br/>\n33 - bard could use for that room - given the group he was in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

Unless you are<br/>\nbeing attacked by multiple mobs, which with an enchanter doesn&#39;t happen too<br/>\noften, the damage output of the shields is sub-par.  We have several other<br/>\noptions which produce more damage per 6 second pulse.  About the only time<br/>\nwe&#39;ve used the damage shields was in multi-bard groups.  There&#39;s almost<br/>\nalways a better song to play than a damage shield</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
