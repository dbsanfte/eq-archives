Our group was kicking it&#39;s rear till it gated out.  Suddenly I&#39;m standing in front of this thing (god knows where, remember never been there before) and it&#39;s beating the tar out of me. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvidenly a BUNCH of my old guildmates were in the area because I started hearing cheers of &quot;GO LYRNIA!&quot; from all over the zone ;)  So, taking the advice of all my old friends I fired off chains at the ugly thing, and high-tailed it away.  Amazingly his bind point was in front of some castle thingie (which I wasn&#39;t about to go near) so I ran through a passage to the right and, luckily, hit a zone line back to Burning Woods ;)  I immediately /guildsay&#39;d (new guild, not old) that I was camping and coming back.<br/>\n<br/>\nEntire group died except me.  Was funny as hell.  All my old guildmates (that guild kinda shattered, we&#39;re in several different guilds now) were sending me /tells &quot;So, did you evade him?&quot;  Took me a minute to remember that when you get summoned the nasties say &quot;You shall not evade me Lyrnia!&quot;  I was rolling laughing when the cleric appeared at his bind point just outside the zoneline ;)  We went back in and CR&#39;d then had fun for a couple hours ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d share.  Was a funny moment for me (though scary!  I generally stay low on hate lists (ancient Lyrnia Secret) so I&#39;ve never gotten summoned before)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath since Beta 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
