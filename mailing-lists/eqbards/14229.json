Sounds like you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have sneak going successfully.  Yes, you clicked the button, yes it<br/>\ngrayed out, but probably it&#39;s not sneaking.  Like sense heading, sneak is a<br/>\nskill you have to build up.  You can tell when you have a successful sneak<br/>\ngoing because you will change to walking at half speed.  Also, he will sell<br/>\nto you &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, keep trying by re-starting sneak until you get a good sneak going then<br/>\nget behind him and sell those rusty weps &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tRokenn Swiftsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tThursday, February 03, 2000 9:08 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Selling to Krak?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAviak&#39;s have no faction so are immune to Carillon.

I conned dubious at first and he told me nicely where the<br/>\n&gt;exit was. Carillon, with flute or without, would not raise my faction above<br/>\n&gt;dubious, and did not change his response. With sneak I got him to<br/>\n&gt;indifferent, but he still wouldn&#39;t sell.
