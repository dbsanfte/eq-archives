I&#39;m gonna get one soon and try<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the overclockers forum I frequent, I can recall no posts lamenting DOA<br/>\n&gt; processors offhand...and these are people who share every step they take<br/>\n&gt; when OC&#39;ing their machines.  :)  The 2 biggest processor killers on the<br/>\n&gt; forum are heat casualties and crushed cores from trying to install<br/>\n&gt; heatsinks.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is no real reason to not consider equally an AMD machine vs an Intel<br/>\n&gt; machine, when shopping around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Atonal<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nah, more bang for the buck...consider also, any pc builder worth their salt<br/>\nwill have filtered the bad processors out before you ever get to see the<br/>\nmachines, i.e. doa rate and failure rate are gonna be much lower than the<br/>\nbuilders.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Henrik Holm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEH@...\">HEH@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 26, 2001 2:27 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: OT Hardware (was:- RE: [eqbards] New Video Card and more<br/>\n&gt; Ram - th e results for me...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And a bit more reliable (less out-of-the-box failures with Intel)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aye, Ive been an avid Intel fan, but do this still count? I know before K7<br/>\n&gt; AMD had pretty lousy stability and QA. I havent heard about any problems<br/>\n&gt; with k7 series though??<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dunno, i quit the shop I was working at a little over a month ago, and<br/>\nhaven&#39;t messed with any since then, but the failure rate was still pretty<br/>\nbad about 3 months ago.  More than I would trust, but AMD seems to be alot<br/>\nbetter about warranty issues than Intel...you can get a replacement AMD<br/>\nrather quickly (if you didn&#39;t nuke it w/ heat or crush it) while Intel<br/>\nwanted to take a while and test the processor you sent back, etc.  (from an<br/>\nOEM source...most of ya&#39;ll won&#39;t have that channel).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy take on the whole issue is:<br/>\nIf you need a solid business machine, buy one from the big manufacturers,<br/>\ni.e. Dell, Gateway, etc.  AMD/Intel<br/>\nIf you want a solid gaming machine, buy one from the big gaming<br/>\nmanufacturers, i.e. Falcon Northwest, Alienware, etc. AMD<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t mind dinking around, and possibly having some major downtime,<br/>\nbuild it yourself. Intel before AMD<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have the cash to invest in one of the big rigs, build it<br/>\nyourself, but be ready for some pitfalls. AMD before Intel.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yeah...I have been real impressed with the 2 machines I&#39;ve seen from<br/>\nAlienware...One a couple of years ago, was the fastest PII I had ever seen,<br/>\ndoing anything.  The latest and greatest my buddy has, AMD 1.3, top of the<br/>\nline Alienware, absolutely smokes on any task you run on it...he dual boots<br/>\nbetween win2k and win98se...and both os&#39;s tear up games.  (I have no<br/>\nassociation to Alienware, don&#39;t even own one...but the next machine I buy<br/>\ninstead of build is gonna come from there...hmm...if I ever buy a machine<br/>\nagain...hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\nBard stuck on bar 40<br/>\nSolusek Ro Blood Tide</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
