Sometimes I get the person<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to assist as a target and in Auto-attack mode.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the cause of the button is yet another client/server sync bug - if<br/>\nyou are hit by the second mob as it is processing the assist code.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn critical situation - my hotkey includes the pullers name (not requiring<br/>\nme to target party member before hitting the hotkey) - and I &quot;Re-assist&quot;<br/>\nconstantly during the fight.  I&#39;ve found the bugged thing to be pretty rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m annoyed by whiners (usually enchanters) who through fits whenever a<br/>\nsingle mezzed mob is awoken - who start ranting about using assist.  Usually<br/>\nyou can get a feel when you have people who are less than competent and when<br/>\n/assist is bugged...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 13, 2000 7:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] /assist problem<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found, regardless of what group make up I&#39;m in or what the puller is<br/>\nusing to pull, /assist can&#39;t be trusted.

Was very<br/>\ninteresting that my cleric&#39;s stun/holy might would stun giants, yet the<br/>\nenchanter stuns would never stick. We may have to experiment with WTYH at<br/>\nsometime as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for AOE stun based around the caster, now I understand why you were<br/>\nsaying they could mez more utilizing stun than they could with just AOE<br/>\nmez.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed something that could very well be a bug. My wife (druid)<br/>\nwould pull froggies to us. I&#39;m sitting next to her so I see what she is<br/>\ntargetted on. I push my &quot;/assist &lt;char_name&gt;&quot; button and interestingly,<br/>\nfind that I&#39;m targetted upon a different frog. (Of course &lt;char_name&gt; is<br/>\nfilled in with her character&#39;s name)<br/>\nIt has wreaked a little havoc having our necro Dot&#39;ing the wrong frog. It<br/>\nhappens intermittantly to us during pulls. I&#39;ve asked my wife to keep her<br/>\nautoattack on even when returning to the camp to see if that helps, but it<br/>\nhas made no difference. Sometimes we have the right frog, sometimes not.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
