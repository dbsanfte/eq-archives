Verant nerfed it by requiring it to completely end before<br/>\nrecasting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis broke our levitate song.  The second and subsequent pulse of AOE (and I<br/>\nassume Selo&#39;s Traveling - didn&#39;t have it then) wouldn&#39;t work until it ran<br/>\nout and you fell.  The unlucky bards who found this out the hard way - and<br/>\nused the song THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO WORK often fell to their death.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was clear that Verant made a change to the spell system without doing ANY<br/>\ntesting on the bard class.  Literally 19 seconds of testing would have<br/>\ncaught this bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly - they made a change to speed where Drums didn&#39;t add to the affect<br/>\nof Selo&#39;s.  Again - many bards died expecting their songs to work they way<br/>\nthey were designed (i.e. running away from mobs etc).  In this case - 3<br/>\nseconds of testing would have caught it.  They admitted it was a bug - but<br/>\nrefused to fix it until the next patch went in.  They said it wasn&#39;t<br/>\ncritical enough (we were upset about this wondering the reaction from the<br/>\nplayer base is SOW was broken...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure other old-timers could probably come up with a half-dozen or more<br/>\nbugs caused by changes to the spell system not intending to affect Bards<br/>\nthat were introduced into the live servers because the most trivial level of<br/>\ntesting the bard class wasn&#39;t done by Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck the Selo&#39;s speed bug was even discovered on Test by players and<br/>\nreported to Verant - and they missed it...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Henrik Holm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEH@...\">HEH@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 10:01 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSelo and arie of eagles do not stack, this was a nessesary nerf because<br/>\nbards would outrun guides and make fun of them.
