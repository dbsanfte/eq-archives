Unfortunately, the training stuff away from the zone line doesnt work, matter of fact, it seems to have the opposite effect.

Nekkid<br/>\n&gt;  me, with a normal drum, and selo&#39;s memmed, and I haul ass.  Hit the<br/>\n&gt;  ground running, and collect all the mobs and train them away from <br/>\n&gt;  the portal, away from the SE corner, into the middle of nowhere then<br/>\n&gt;  curl up and die.  Immediately following that let everyone zone in<br/>\n&gt;  however they wanted to.  (I&#39;ll leave breaking the plane discussion<br/>\n&gt;  out)  Since I wasn&#39;t L50, that idea was dismissed as bullshit.  To<br/>\n&gt;  this day, I think that sacrifice would still work.  The main problem<br/>\n&gt;  you have upon zoning is a shiverback or scarling sitting there <br/>\n&gt;  pounding the crap out of you, and then your client gives you control.<br/>\n&gt;  By that time you are dead.  Loading, please wait... to another Loading,<br/>\n&gt;  please wait.  If a bard could clear that garbage, and avoid a DT<br/>\n&gt;  from Cazic, I think the portal trash would stay clear long enough<br/>\n&gt;  for players to zone in.  This is purely hypothetical as no one <br/>\n&gt;  wanted to listen to little me.  8)   As for pulling, I wish. hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, the training stuff away from the zone line doesnt work,<br/>\nmatter of fact, it seems to have the opposite effect. Quite a few people on<br/>\ntunare had the same idea and yeah, i got picked for train duty. I was quite<br/>\nhappy to do it though if it ment an easier breakin for everybody else. I<br/>\nbasically did everything you suggested except i had no invis (the idea was<br/>\nto attract attention, not avoid it) and the end results where disastrous. I<br/>\ntried doing several patterns, sometimes running in circls around the gate<br/>\nhill and then running far off, othertimes just tagging the stuff inbetween<br/>\nthe corner and the impt tower... etc. All of em resulted in the same thing,<br/>\none full zone of uber pissed mobs looking for something to kill. It just<br/>\nmade a big backlash that fell back with a mighty THWACK on anybody that<br/>\ntried to zone it or was in the corner. I lived plenty long enough to get<br/>\nstuff far away, matter of fact i made it to cazic himself all but once<br/>\n(tried punching him but everytime i got close he dt&#39;d me heh). Several<br/>\nother people tried this including big ogre warriors, troll sk&#39;s etc. End<br/>\nresult was all the same, just stirred everything up with out sufficiently<br/>\nclearing the corner/gate hill.

My bard and necro both have a<br/>\nflawless zone in record to the pof, and the bard got his full suit of<br/>\nimbrued before verant moved it to scorn banshees in the PoH. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish the train method worked, and i am not completly ruling it out, if<br/>\nyou can figure out a way of making it work please SHARE =)<br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 50 Bard<br/>\nEnoch Lyciferous, lvl 50 Necro<br/>\nColet Khrusallis, lvl 25 Cleric<br/>\nTalisman - www.norrath.org</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
