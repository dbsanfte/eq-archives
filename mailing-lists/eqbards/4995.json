Wizards can&#39;t get into the fight on the field and do<br/>\nany good. They need to stand back overlooking the battle and cast spells<br/>\nfrom afar. Otherwise, their frail bodies are swiped aside in a quick death.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Wizard, you start with 20 hit points. They don&#39;t go up quickly after<br/>\nthat either. At level 5 I believe I have 60 (going from memory). I&#39;m finding<br/>\nthat a Wizard is VERY hard to solo in the first 5 levels compared to the<br/>\nBard. Spells are easily interrupted (even when standing still and not being<br/>\nattacked) and if something isn&#39;t affected by one of your spells, you&#39;re<br/>\ntoast. No Selo&#39;s to escape with, not enough time to gate, no way to run fast<br/>\nenough.. just toast. Also keep in mind that Wizards have NO healing spells.<br/>\nI helped someone out last night while fighting something that was red to me<br/>\n(I&#39;m a sucker for someone in trouble).. It killed her, I killed it (with<br/>\nlike 5 hp&#39;s left and no mana) and then ended up dying from the poison. Had I<br/>\nhad Hymn at level 4, or minor healing at level 1, I would have lived. I have<br/>\na certain respect for Wizards that have made it to level 12 and above now..<br/>\nBut I still love my Bard and his less-than-perfect songs..<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For my tastes, a mage should be a little old<br/>\n&gt; man or woman, complete weakling, easily<br/>\n&gt; slaughtered with a gigantic axe...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And they most definitely are. If a mob gets close enough to one, they&#39;re<br/>\neasily killed.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That is if one could get close to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly.  =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
