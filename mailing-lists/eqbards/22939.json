Other<br/>\nthan that, it&#39;s too close to Neriak.<br/>\n<br/>\nSouth Karana = Unk - No if they reason that Arena is only 2 zone lines away.<br/>\nYes if they decide it&#39;s too hard to get a bind in Arena, since there is<br/>\nnormally nobody in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDagnor&#39;s Cauldron = No - Gfay and Kaladim are both close.  Kedge would<br/>\nprobably get a small xp modifier boost, and Unrest an even larger one, to<br/>\nentice the lower levels to try, who have a harder time travelling Dagnors.<br/>\n<br/>\nOOT = Unk - Could go either way.  Due to only being able to zone by boat,<br/>\nthe arguments are strong in either case.<br/>\n<br/>\nLfay = No - Only 1 zone away from Gfay, and the spires.  Although the<br/>\npathing is broke, they could probably even get away without increasing the<br/>\nxp modifier for Mistmoore.  It&#39;s always been relatively popular despite it&#39;s<br/>\nfaults.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeeroot = No - Only 1 zone away from Cazic Thule.  Too close.<br/>\n<br/>\nInnothule = Yes - Despite being only 1 zone from Upper Guk, it is a good<br/>\nmidpoint between arena and Freeport.  Will perhaps be a &quot;camp&quot; of some type,<br/>\nwith light aligned guards?  The points for, taking into consideration the<br/>\nzones around it, to me seem to outweight the points against, regarding the<br/>\nproximity to Lguk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of Odus = No - Between Erud for the lights, and Paineel for the darks,<br/>\nnothing needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nN Ro, S Ro, E Commons, W Commons = No - Proximity to FP, Neriak, High Pass,<br/>\nand Rivervale.  Especially if my Innothule prediction is borne out.  :)<br/>\n(Befallen is avoided, not because of binding issues, but because it&#39;s a<br/>\ndeath trap with little reason to try.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEverfrost = Yes - A dark aligned camp would be most likely, since light<br/>\naligned folks can bind in Halas.  Fixing Permafrost will also help, though.<br/>\n:)  Might as well be named Permatrain, as it is now.<br/>\n<br/>\nKunark and Velious - I just don&#39;t have enough knowledge of these zones.  My<br/>\nKunark is limited to FV and LOIO, with some FM thrown in, and my Velious is<br/>\nlimited to Frankel the Pirate in N Ro.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone with some free time should maybe keep up with the predictions (I<br/>\nwould, but I don&#39;t have the free time...hehe..honest), and once the points<br/>\ngo in, see how we did.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 11:24 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bind Poll<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my guesses...<br/>\n<br/>\nVery likely:<br/>\nLavastorm (outside Solusek & Najena)<br/>\nSouth Karana (outside Paw)<br/>\nDagnor&#39;s Cauldron (perhaps anywhere)<br/>\nOcean of Tears (perhaps anywhere)<br/>\nLesser Faydark (outside Mistmoore)<br/>\nFeerott (outside Cazic Thule)<br/>\nInnothule Swamp (outside Guk)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot so likely:<br/>\nToxxulia (outside Paineel)<br/>\nErud&#39;s Crossing (at docks)<br/>\nWest Commons (outside Belfallen)<br/>\nEverfrost (outside Permafrost)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
