Perhaps some perverse enchanter has cast a twisted illusion upon<br/>\n&gt; us.  Does anyone know if perchance the great powers of magic may some day<br/>\n&gt; set this straight?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope this will be fixed someday.  It has been broken for as long as I<br/>\nremember.  If they just made a model for holding a drum, that would be enough,<br/>\nthe strumming motion SORT OF looks like a tapping motion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that it will be fixed someday, but who knows.  Drums USED to look<br/>\nlike flutes, then they looked like chests, now they actually look like drums<br/>\n(in your inventory at least) so things are getting better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; On another topic, recently I attained the 7th circle of skill and after<br/>\n&gt; saving and even sacrificing a bit of personal jewelery was able to purchase<br/>\n&gt; the scroll for the Whistling Warsong of the 7th circle.  Imagine my dismay<br/>\n&gt; when what I thought was newfound power had less effect though concentrated<br/>\n&gt; on me than the old 1st circle song with which we all start has on me and<br/>\n&gt; all others in my adventuring group.  Can anyone encourage me that perhaps<br/>\n&gt; some day my investment in the new song will be of some value?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The level 7 song is quite useful.  In addition to the changes you mention, it<br/>\nspeeds up your attacks somewhat, a small difference at first, but it gets more<br/>\nnoticeable later on.  The level 7 song is essentially a personal-only version<br/>\nof the level 10 song, Anthem de Arms.<br/>\n<br/>\nTip: When you get to level 10, try &quot;juggling&quot; both songs at the same time.  You<br/>\nwill notice a nice synergy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Likewise, I find the Jig o&#39; Vigor to be of no use.  Have I missed some good<br/>\n&gt; and valued application?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not really, it&#39;s sort of useless.  Sometimes when running very long distances,<br/>\nyou will lose stamina.  Also, if you are without food and drink you may lose<br/>\nstamina at a very increased rate.  Otherwise, it&#39;s not too good.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
