Kick is a skill that does<br/>\nnot impact the Ranger&#39;s ability to melee.  It may not be something he can do while casting, but this isn&#39;t<br/>\na huge impact, since casting time is relatively short.  In other words, his kick is free extra damage, our<br/>\nBellow is not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; yep i agree with the we do 50% of hybrid and 25% of pure melee damage<br/>\n&gt; figures.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I tossed out the 25% and 50% as ballpark figures.  I wouldn&#39;t mind running some real tests if I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get shipped to NYC five days a week.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Now, as to this comparison of Melee dmg.  Why are we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comparing our 2nd rate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dmg method to other hybrid&#39;s 1st rate dmg method?  Our #1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage producer is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our songs.  Our songs vastly outdamage any hybrid&#39;s damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; curve when used<br/>\n&gt; &gt; correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; a combo of songs is very powerful, but wouldn&#39;t you say the big downside is<br/>\n&gt; that being AE we have to attack multiple targets with them (and thus get<br/>\n&gt; pounded on by multiple mobs), and they have a very high resist rate against<br/>\n&gt; similarly levelled mobs (especially at 50).  whereas meleeing has the plus<br/>\n&gt; of not being resisted (in a sense, no you don&#39;t always hit and don&#39;t always<br/>\n&gt; hit for max) and being on a single target.  i&#39;d love some single target<br/>\n&gt; damage songs, and i heard our chant songs were recently really fixed, so i<br/>\n&gt; may break those out and give them a try.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you can just say that our songs are better than other hybrid&#39;s melee and make any<br/>\nconclusions about our relative strength.  When we use attack songs to do damage, we give up our ability to<br/>\nuse any other songs.  (We can only use three at a time, no matter what).  Plus, if we&#39;re using<br/>\ninstruments, we sacrifice our melee in order to get the song effects.  In order to compare us to other<br/>\nhybrids, you have to compare the package:  Bard melee + songs =? Other melee + spells.  If we&#39;re singing<br/>\nattack songs, that reduces to:  Bard songs =? Other melee + spells.  My point was that the melee part of<br/>\nour equation is weak; in order for class balance to exist, our songs should be stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Bottom line:  Bards are not a melee class in the classic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sense.  Yes, we can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (and should) get in there and mix it up.  But no, we aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; meant to be up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there swinging swords all the time.  90% of the time our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; songs are our best<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s another question that can use a lot of analysis.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 47 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
