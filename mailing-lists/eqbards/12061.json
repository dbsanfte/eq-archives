I only mix in Hymn with Clarity anymore when I&#39;m feeling like<br/>\ntopping everyone off that last little sliver that the Clerics/Druids/Shaman<br/>\ncan really do.  But to be perfectly honest, after 40+ levels of mashing the<br/>\nbuttons, it&#39;s kinda nice to just sit back after a battle and be the mana<br/>\npump.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing - I think it was Sylly a few days back who mentioned carrying<br/>\nJasper and Peridot around with her for the Clerics in her groups.  I started<br/>\ndoing this, and when I hand them over to the Cleric and everyone gets<br/>\nSymboled you&#39;d think *I* was the Cleric.  Man.  If you wanna be popular with<br/>\ngroups carry Symbol reagents appropriate to your level around with you.<br/>\nVery good tip Sylly.<br/>\n<br/>\nClerical Symbol Reagents at levels:<br/>\n-----------------------------------<br/>\nLevel 14: Cat&#39;s Eye Agate<br/>\nLevel 24: Bloodstone<br/>\nLevel 34: Jasper, ~9.5gp each<br/>\nLevel 44: Peridot, ~9.5pp each<br/>\n<br/>\nBuying a stack of 20 Peridots is nontrivial for all but the highest level<br/>\ncharacters.  But like I was last night, if you&#39;re camping the Ballroom in<br/>\nMistmoore 9.5pp seems pretty inexpensive for the buff it gives.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 40th song Bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   We need an analysis of Heal/Mana mix versus straight Mana with<br/>\n&gt;   healers doing the Healing.  At higher levels it&#39;s not efficient<br/>\n&gt;   enough to play Hymm on tanks who have up to 2000 hp.  With the<br/>\n&gt;   pack regen spells, and word of health spells, it&#39;s definitely<br/>\n&gt;   more efficient to go straight mana.  I&#39;m not sure about L35<br/>\n&gt;   or less though.  I am the master of low downtime, but I&#39;m curious<br/>\n&gt;   if around L35 it&#39;s better to twist both or play one.
