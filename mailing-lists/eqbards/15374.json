They have come up with some formulas that<br/>\nexplain much of the hell level and hell level +1 effects.  Based on their<br/>\nformulas (which are only a guess) I think the difference in experience loss<br/>\ncan be explained.<br/>\n<br/>\nlvl, exp needed, exp lost  (examples made up)<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\nlvl 29    5000    500<br/>\nlvl 30    10000   500<br/>\nlvl 31    2500    500<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, the experience lost is linear, while the exp needed for hell<br/>\nlevel takes a big jump, and there is a dip afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nA death at 29 costs you half a bubble.<br/>\nA death at 30 costs you a quarter of a bubble.<br/>\nA death at 31 costs you a full bubble.<br/>\nBut the total experience loss is the same in each case.<br/>\n(based on the made of example above)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince experience for HL+1 is so much less than HL, the same amount of<br/>\nexperience loss will result in a bigger percentage of the bar.  You are not<br/>\nreally losing that much more experience numerically, but just graphically.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can test this yourself by measuring how long it takes to make up from a<br/>\ndeath in HL vs HL+1.  The time to regain the lost experience should be<br/>\nroughly equal, therefore the loss is roughly equal.  Your bar dropped more<br/>\nin HL+1, but you regain it faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    Date: Wed, 23 Feb 2000 15:22:26 -0500 (EST)<br/>\n&gt;    From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You have it backwards, but yes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I died at 47, I only lost a half bubble into 46.  All my<br/>\n&gt; friends who died at 46 said they lost over a bubble. That<br/>\n&gt; indicates the exp loss at 47 is less than the exp loss at 46.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I died at 31, I lost a half bubble into 30.  When I died<br/>\n&gt; at 30, I lost a quarter bubble.  That indicates the exp loss<br/>\n&gt; at 31 is more than the exp loss at 30.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Both of these indicate the exp loss at (hell level+1) is<br/>\n&gt; greater than at other levels. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
