Bard charms a mob to get it<br/>\nreally mad at him.  No one else in party attacks mob until sword procs.<br/>\nEveryone then attacks.  If mob immediately switches over to another player<br/>\nthen there is a good chance the proc worked.  A cleric or enchanter would<br/>\nneed to be on hand to make sure the bard didn&#39;t die.  Even then it might be<br/>\nhard to conclusively determine the proc was why the mob stopped attacking<br/>\nthe bard.  All in all not certain if its worth the time to even worry about<br/>\nit.    <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

Great graphic for a high<br/>\nlevel weapon huh?
