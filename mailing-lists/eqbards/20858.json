We<br/>\ndid about as well as the other two groups at the giant castle.  We had zero<br/>\ndown time that&#39;s for sure.  IIRC, I was playing Chains, Psalm of Warmth,<br/>\nWarsong, and Pixie Strike (for the MR debuff); another bard was doing<br/>\nChords, Denon&#39;s, and Hymn while instrument swapping; a third was doing Chant<br/>\nof Battle, Fulfill&#39;s, and Guardian Rthymns, all with drum; the 4th Bard was<br/>\nalso doing Warsong, Pixie Strike, and I think Jig.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 07, 2000 1:34 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard&#39;s Guild on Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would imagine that they have a very close alliance with the all-necro<br/>\nguild and the all-clerics-who-do-resses guild. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, 2 bards in one hunting - not ressing - party was a waste<br/>\nof a slot. And 3 bards in a hunting party meant certain death. With 4 bards,<br/>\nI would simply /shudder but have never had that experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nClass diversity provides synergy.  The whole can be greater than the sum of<br/>\nthe parts. Having 2 of any class in a group has problems and that includes 2<br/>\nwarriors, imho. Maybe not a problem for the bard but certainly a problem for<br/>\nthe cleric.  I know that some ppl do dragon and god groups with 2 war, 2<br/>\nclr, 1 bard and someone to take the HT/DT but for your daily grind - two of<br/>\nanything can be less than desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. there is an all bard guild on Innoruuk: Miraculous Muscians.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s. &quot;I would not want to join any club that would have me for a member.&quot;<br/>\n(was that W.C.
