I am level 14 and it is a great soloing place. Instructions:<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you enter the Nektulos (use your drum, you very much want the speed) hug the zone to your left,<br/>\nswim the piranha infested river (leaving a chunk or two of your flesh as a toll) and fly all the way<br/>\nto Lavastorm. Do not gawk at the stone guardians *laughs* as a Teir&#39;Dal they are your good friends,<br/>\nas a Fier&#39;Dal they will kill ya dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn lavastorm go after the Fire drakes, rock dervishes and maybe the fire imps. Even greens were<br/>\ngiving exp at 14 btw.  Avoid the Fire Elementals, blues were kicking my butt. You might do okay with<br/>\na green. Lava Crawlers are WAY more than they appear. I generally hunt the area between the entrance<br/>\nand Najena (keeping me close to a zone *laughs*).<br/>\nUse Elemental rhythms constantly on Drakes, Imps and Elems. I was weaving Anthem, Elemental Rhythms<br/>\nand Bellow. Though it depends on your weapon, I am finding using Bellow after Bellow (on regular<br/>\nmonsters, or say, the Rock Dervishes) to not be as effective as Anthem/Bellow/Bellow/Anthem because<br/>\nAnthem with my Dragoon Dagger is a very very potent mix.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, have fun, oh and occasionally a Stone Guardian will wander close to the Lavastorm Entrance<br/>\nin Neriak, so just prepare yourself, you may not be zoning to safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I just kept laughing that I was there at all. On Rallos Zek (where I played until<br/>\nit was maliciously and negligently hozed by Verant) as a wood elf I would have been hunted down like<br/>\na dog. *laughs*, so enjoy your reletive freedom in that part of the world! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz, Scarlet Moon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
