A group of 6 <br/>\nHybrids would FLY compared to how they leveled pre-patch (it&#39;s all <br/>\nrelative, tho.. a group of 6 Hybrids will level at the same pace as a <br/>\ngroup of 6 Clerics, for example).  And that&#39;s before the Group EXP <br/>\nBonus.  You will now NOT share the 10% penalty for INT Casters, 20% <br/>\nfor Monks, 20%? for Ogres, Trolls and Shaman.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Hybrid soloing will level 40% faster than he did pre-patch.  A <br/>\nDruid soloing will level at the exact same pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nHell levels still do exist (they didn&#39;t change the exp tables at <br/>\nall), but you&#39;re moving so fast now they don&#39;t seem so bad.  <br/>\nHopefully, 59 will seem like 51 used to. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
