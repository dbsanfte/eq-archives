 i will go with some nevers too.  i have never had this land on<br/>\n&gt;an uber mob.  i have never had this land on a character i am dueling who is<br/>\n&gt;equal or higher level than me and has any sense to put some MR gear on.  and<br/>\n&gt;i will never have this memmed if i am exp&#39;ing or raiding.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well never having a resist problem doesn&#39;t mean i have no resists, just that the<br/>\nresists are not excessive.  i don&#39;t know what you consider &#39;&#39;ubermob&#39;&#39; being from<br/>\nafterlife, but i was able to land this on innothule and maestro.  i don&#39;t have the opportunity<br/>\nto fight mobs much bigger than that at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; i pointed out 2 good ways to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; get quite a bit of damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out of this song (one of which was in an enchanter group, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; where many people think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they are useless).  the song has been compared to harm touch, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and i think it compares<br/>\n&gt; &gt; favorably to harmtouch with respect to damage/refresh time.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;you call good damage 0.20 damage/second?  and that&#39;s being conservative,<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s actually less.  you pointed out ways you can use the song, they are not<br/>\n&gt;good ways they are just ways you used to point out to people that you do not<br/>\n&gt;think it is useless.  harm touch doesn&#39;t take a spell slot, and does a lot<br/>\n&gt;more damage and is resisted far less with it&#39;s recent changes and i think a<br/>\n&gt;new SK discipline, and DDD is a waste of a song slot.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well, for those people who complain that they are useless when grouped with an<br/>\nenchanter, they should have plenty of open spell slots since they can&#39;t figure out<br/>\nanything else to sing.  harmtouch does a lot more damage on a per second basis<br/>\nthan dirge?  harmtouch would have to do more than twice as much damage as dirge <br/>\nand you must only get a single target with dirge every time in order for this to be true.<br/>\ni pointed out 2 good ways to get more than 1 target on a regular basis even when<br/>\ngrouped with an enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; i almost never solo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;i am guessing you almost never go up against uber mobs in SoV or even Kunark<br/>\n&gt;either.  you would not think bards are overpowered.  i think we kick ass in<br/>\n&gt;an exp group, but i don&#39;t think that means we need to be extremely<br/>\n&gt;unimportant on raids.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>how many other classes are not extremely unimportant on raids?  clerics, warriors,<br/>\nrogues?  any others?  balance could mean overpowered in some instances and<br/>\nunderpowered in others.  clerics for example are very good in groups and uberraids<br/>\nbut aren&#39;t very good solo.  druids are very good solo, pretty good in groups, and not<br/>\nvery useful on uberraids either.<br/>\n<br/>\nlike i have said many times prior.  the bard&#39;s biggest strength is filling the gaps in a party.<br/>\non a large raids there aren&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) be gaps to fill so we will be less effective.  except<br/>\nfor the few people in uber guilds who only go on raids, what is the percentage of raids to<br/>\n&#39;&#39;normal&#39;&#39; hunting?  maybe 90/10?  so if we&#39;re overpowered in 90% of the game and underpowered<br/>\nin 10%, doesn&#39;t that work out to being overpowered as a class?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Shada </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
