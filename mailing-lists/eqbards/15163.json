I encountered a 2nd (nearly<br/>\n3rd) level young human named Duncan in his lair.<br/>\nHe is the common spawn in the &quot;child&#39;s bedroom&quot; of<br/>\nthe Estate of Klug. Not wanting to ruin my Wife of<br/>\nKlug faction, I decided I&#39;d use Lullaby to nod the<br/>\nmob, so that I could run away and continue<br/>\nadventuring.  Now keep in mind that I&#39;m 31st<br/>\nlevel, which is WELL beyond the level where I<br/>\nshould have any problems with Lullaby functioning<br/>\nat peak efficiency.  Well, my first attempt was<br/>\nresisted entirely...the mob continued to attack<br/>\nme, saying, &quot;You will not escape me so easily,<br/>\nDaddy00!  More stories!!!&quot;  My second attempt<br/>\nappeared to work, but just as I was running away<br/>\n(down the stairs) the mob woke up and began<br/>\nattacking me again, &quot;Daddy00, I&#39;m scared of the<br/>\nfire alarm!&quot;  Again, I fired up Lullaby.  Again,<br/>\nthe mob appeared to nod off, and I actually almost<br/>\nmade it to the zone, when it woke up again.  I ran<br/>\nback up the stairs to avoid aggroing anything<br/>\nelse, and Lullabied again.  Only this final one<br/>\nstuck.  Now that&#39;s only one out of four attempts,<br/>\nfor an overal resist rate of 75%!  I think this is<br/>\nintolerable, and I may have to stop playing EQ if<br/>\nVerant doesn&#39;t fix this obvious nerf.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhammer, 35th level bard of E&#39;Ci.<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\nSteven S.
