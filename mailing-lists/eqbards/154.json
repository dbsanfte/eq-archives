I believe this to be true, and also for the case where you are using an instrument.

I noticed that the effect of Chant went up as my<br/>\nsinging improved, and again as my skill with a drum increased (only<br/>\nsmall improvements, mind you).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One other thing I have noticed.  The time it takes to scribe a song in your<br/>\n&gt; spellbook increases based on the level of the song.  For me (6th level),<br/>\n&gt; memorizing Chant of Battle only takes a few seconds but memorizing Hymn of<br/>\n&gt; Restoration takes about a minute.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is true.  Being of the 10th level, I am able to memorise Chant<br/>\nin seconds but Anthem takes me about a minute.  Hymn of Restoration<br/>\nused to take as long as Anthem does now, but it is closer to Chant<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This can be a pain in the butt since,<br/>\n&gt; everytime you get killed, you have to rescribe your spells.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t you mean re-memorise?  Your songs/spells stay permanently<br/>\nscribed into your song/spell book.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; assume, and hope, that as your singing ability increases the time it takes<br/>\n&gt; to scribe songs in your spellbook proportionately decreases.  Can anyone<br/>\n&gt; provide a definitive answer?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As I have never had to re-scribe a song, I cannot provide help.  It<br/>\ndoes seem to be constant, but I have purchased my songs as soon as<br/>\nthey were available, so if scribing was related to level, I likely<br/>\nwould not notice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I just hit level 7 and purchased Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong because I do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a lot of soloing.  I memorized and started it up and to my disappointment<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t notice a great skill boost.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally, I did not purchase the Warsong, as I do little soloing.<br/>\nDo not underestimate the effects of a couple of extra STR and AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd RE: Anthem versus Chant<br/>\nAnthem is a singing song, giving maximum benefit while swinging your<br/>\nmintaur axe.  To get the most from Chant you need to equip your drum<br/>\nand punch the opposition.  In a party of tanks this may not matter,<br/>\nbut as a person who prefers small groups (2-3), the extra hits from<br/>\nmy axe help lots.<br/>\nHence Anthem is worthwhile even when alone.<br/>\nAlso, +10 STR is great (at level 10 singing ability).<br/>\n<br/>\nCould someone please let me know what Warsong gives you (exactly) and<br/>\nwhat instrument it uses?  Please include your level and skill in sing/<br/>\ninstrument (if any) if possible.  I am curious as to whether it is <br/>\nworth the boat ride to purchase this song for the small amount of<br/>\nsoloing I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMully<br/>\nHalf-elf bard from the realm of Veeshan<br/>\nCurrently residing in Freeport</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
