Exactly the same thing happens with my magic axe that casts Berserker <br/>\nStrength.  Sounds like it may be a bug on all auto-spell-casting weapons. <br/>\n Please, everyone who encounters this file another /bug report.  It&#39;s <br/>\ncrippling to the Bard class.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, being stunned by a monster also unlocks it.  Sometimes being <br/>\nbashed without stun seems to as well, but I&#39;m not sure about that.  The <br/>\n/stopsong command does NOT fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong, on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
