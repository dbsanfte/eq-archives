I remember those days.  Bards would always run around the place<br/>\n  and as a cleric in beta it really pissed me off &lt;g&gt;  I couldn&#39;t ever<br/>\n  meditate.  hehe, one song pulse, and poof I stand up.  I too will agree <br/>\n  with the assessment made which states:<br/>\n<br/>\n  bard sings song.<br/>\n  song has a fixed radius.<br/>\n  locate all objects within the radius of bard and contact them.<br/>\n  if song is party based, and this object is in party, affect.<br/>\n  if song is nonparty based, and this object is not in party, affect.<br/>\n<br/>\n  what did verant forget?<br/>\n<br/>\n  well, since bards in beta affected everyone, thus making them<br/>\n  unbalanced, verant couldnt radically change the bard song code<br/>\n  so they put in this object sensor stuff in.  all objects get<br/>\n  the signal from the bard, whether the song affects them directly<br/>\n  is based on the party status.  pretty easy patch to implement, <br/>\n  and it solved the problem. (kinda)<br/>\n<br/>\n  what it didn&#39;t do is prevent NPCs from receiving a signal and<br/>\n  interpreting it as assisting another player.  if you are a druid<br/>\n  who happens to kite a NPC through my pulsing heal/mana/selos,<br/>\n  I am instantly added to the hate list and will receive faction<br/>\n  hits.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is my belief that this stems the bard hate and faction mishaps<br/>\n  we often see.  This only affects party based songs.  If verant<br/>\n  would take the time to code in signals only sent to players in<br/>\n  the group, I believe this would eliminate a lot of headaches we<br/>\n  often receive through no fault of our own.  Damn, verant fix<br/>\n  something the right way?  I&#39;m dreaming again, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
