But personally (and those are the only<br/>\nfeelings that I am able to express!) I am somewhat disappointed<br/>\nwith Verant and the way it has handled certain issues.<br/>\nThe whole probelm with the login/chat server?  Isn&#39;t that the sort<br/>\nof thing a beta is for?<br/>\nRouter problems?  OK, maybe UUNet is 100% responsible, but I really<br/>\ndo doubt it.  Again, the beta is when you test server loads and the<br/>\nlike (to Verant&#39;s credit, they did give us an extra two weeks to<br/>\nmake up for it).<br/>\nBut it is the little things that annoy.  Customer service.  Going<br/>\noverboard on things like &#39;exploits&#39;, to the point where nobody knows<br/>\nwhat an exploit is.  Annoying little (and not so little) bugs<br/>\nthat, once again, should reasonably been taken care of in the beta<br/>\nphases IMHO.  The lack of GM support during &#39;odd&#39; hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologise to those of you who are annoyed that this post (and<br/>\nrelated posts) are not strictly on-topic for this mailing list.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anybody know of a list that is related to technical aspects<br/>\nof the game?<br/>\n<br/>\nRod</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
