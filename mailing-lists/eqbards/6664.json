I used to buy 1 or 2 games a month, but since then I think I&#39;ve<br/>\nbought a total of maybe 3 other games, none of which I have played (with<br/>\nthe exception of Grim Fandango, one of the best adventure games I&#39;ve ever<br/>\nplayed).  So that&#39;s more than a year of game money saved by EQ.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m STILL only a level 26 bard.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhammer of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:01 PM 9/16/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;LOL&gt; I absolutely agree as well.

A lot of them I would not even finish <br/>\n&gt;&gt; because I got bored<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with them.  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since April and I am still <br/>\n&gt;&gt; having lots of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fun playing.  As a 22d level bard, I still have alot of <br/>\n&gt;&gt; things I can look<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; forward to doing in the game.  I haven&#39;t even considered <br/>\n&gt;&gt; buying a new game<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; since April. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;   Well put !!!! I was just telling my wife how much money she save<br/>\n&gt;&gt; because I have not brought the 3 or 4 games a month that I used to ! <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Now I may but Diablo 2 but EQ I play every day and the one game I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; brought since EQ (TA Kingdoms) I haven&#39;t bothered to finish. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; But I will<br/>\n&gt;&gt; collect pop bottles on the side of the road to get the EQ <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Expansion pack<br/>\n&gt;&gt; :) You can&#39;t beat playing with real folk :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    Bill, AKA Moonflower CZ-Thule<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  New!!
