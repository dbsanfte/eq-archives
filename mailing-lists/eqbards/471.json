That indicates that expending the initial practice<br/>\n&gt;point to get the String skill gave me a skill level of 8.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On the other hand, when I first started my character I expended one<br/>\n </span></blockquote>practice<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;point in Sense Heading.  The next time I went up a level in Sense Heading,<br/>\n&gt;my skill level was only 2.  That indicated one practice point spent and one<br/>\n&gt;skill level gained.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, does expending a practice point give you a random amount of skill<br/>\n </span></blockquote>levels<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;based on your INT and/or WIS score or does it only give you one skill level<br/>\n&gt;per practice point?  If the second case is true, how do you account for me<br/>\n&gt;getting 8 skill points in String while only expending 1 practice point?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reason for asking:  I am about to embark on a secondary career as the<br/>\n&gt;Kelethin brewmaster for E&#39;ci.  I haven&#39;t expended any practice points in<br/>\n&gt;brewing yet.  I want to get my skill up to 10 before I start the learning<br/>\n&gt;process.  Just need to know if I only need to put a couple of practice<br/>\n&gt;points in it or will I need to expend 10 practice points.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Galtin<br/>\n&gt;E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Join the Star Wars craze!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Set up your Star Wars list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
