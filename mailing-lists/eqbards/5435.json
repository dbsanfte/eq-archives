I actually didn&#39;t die, but I came close<br/>\nto dying three times.  It was the first time I have used my squad ring more<br/>\nthan once in a playing session.  The first time I had zoned into RunnyEye,<br/>\nto be greeted, and stunned by two dazed goblin guards.  I clicked my ring<br/>\nfor a heal and still only got out with only 5hp left.  Then as I returned<br/>\nback from Rivervale I got into a disagreement when Broon decided I couldn&#39;t<br/>\ncross the bridge in East Karana.  Used my ring and was down to 13hp&#39;s when I<br/>\nhit the shortcut under the bridge after falling off the bridge while<br/>\nstunned.  ran back to Rivervale, recharged ring and headed for Qeynos the<br/>\nthird time.  Running across Qeynos hills, I was jumped by Crumpy Irontoe?<br/>\nNever seen or heard of him before.  He was beating me up pretty good thanks<br/>\nto the help of a rabid grizzly.  Used the ring a third time and still only<br/>\nhad 9 hps after finishing off Crumpy.  That was one tough dwarf for only<br/>\nhaving a rusty hammer on him.  Does he have any quest related purpose anyone<br/>\nout there has heard wind of?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 23, 1999 10:36 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Frustration Story (OT - Long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn, was last night everyone&#39;s night to die multiple times?  <br/>\nI had my first triple-death night since I was trying to help<br/>\nsomeone find and retrieve their corpse in Runnyeye 5 levels<br/>\nago.
