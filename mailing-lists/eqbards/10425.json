Make sure you put at least one point into your brass skill when<br/>\nyou train (i put a all I could as soon as I could) because it does take a<br/>\nbit to fire up this song when you first start using it. I did ask a high<br/>\nlevel bard what the best thing to do to max the song out was and he said go<br/>\nto freeport newbie area... it did help, then I used it in EC in the easier<br/>\narea and that helped, finally I got too impatient, so I just started using<br/>\nit along with the other two (CoD and Hymn) and in 5 days it went from 30 or<br/>\n40something to it being in the 70s now - can&#39;t wait until it catches the<br/>\nrest of my instruments! One of the things I have found was that I&#39;ve started<br/>\nusing more than just the basic hotkey setups too - I have one for melee with<br/>\nthe inventory and melee slots - and one for songs (those two I use together<br/>\nwhen grouping where I don&#39;t want to pull lots of things with the DDD/CoD<br/>\nsongs)- but I also have one that has DDD/CoD/Hymn AND a melee slot with two<br/>\ninventory slots - where I switch the horn with the lute and have the drum<br/>\nhandy in case I need to run....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrangwen Incantare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
