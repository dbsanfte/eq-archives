Nothing is set in stone yet on <br/>\n&gt; this, it still has to be reviewed, but I thought I&#39;d let you know what<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; thinking about. We are thinking about reducing secondary resists for <br/>\n&gt; targeted mesmerize songs (with the possibility of a new song along these <br/>\n&gt; lines). There are some other potential changes that we are considering,<br/>\n&gt; but <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll have to tell you about them after we have a chance to talk them over <br/>\n&gt; further.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Alan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
