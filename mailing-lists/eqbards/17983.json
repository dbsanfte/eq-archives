It was giving<br/>\n&gt;messages as of the previous patch, but I only saw them twice when I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;re-Chain the mob.

I was using it yesterday on green cons <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;it was wearing off early fairly often.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A week ago I could keep high blue gargoyles continuously chained with a 3<br/>\n&gt;song weave, yesterday I couldn&#39;t always keep mobs 10 levels below me<br/>\n&gt;continuously chained.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now that we are getting messages when our song effects wear off, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;noticed that our snare song amost never lasts the full duration. Many times<br/>\n&gt;it wears off as soon as I finish singing it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was wondering if any of you were having the same problem and whether or<br/>\n&gt;not this is by design or a bug that we should bring to the attention of the<br/>\n&gt;powers that be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Draelon<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
