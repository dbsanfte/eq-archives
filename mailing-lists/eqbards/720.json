The way I remedy the problem is rapidly clicking a<br/>\nsong, or I have songs in quick slots and just keep tapping 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2<br/>\nreal fast until it clears.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Rogers Pessin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rpessin@...\">rpessin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I had the same thing happen with a tentacle whip.  I was singing one<br/>\n&gt;of my songs when the whips life draining effect went off.  At that<br/>\n&gt;moment, my spell slots un-grayed so it looked like I wasn&#39;t singing<br/>\n&gt;anymore, but my song effect still was in place and continued.  Trying<br/>\n&gt;to sing a new song resulted in it saying the song stopped, but the<br/>\n&gt;original song going when the weapon effect went off was still in<br/>\n&gt;place.  Zoning or logging is the only way to get your songs back on<br/>\n&gt;track.  I did report this up using /bug.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tigsen<br/>\n&gt;11th level bard on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- jay schultze &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;jay schultze&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I can confirm this one. Also, bard songs have some special &quot;Side<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Effects&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;times.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Some of these can be useful, some can be lethal. For example:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Root - While playing the Accelerando, root and similar spells that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; generate<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;the &quot;BOOT&quot; icon will<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;             have no effect on you.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I seem to remember that WHILE playing Accelerando it was possible<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for me to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; be rooted, BUT i could cancel the effect by stopping and restarting<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; song. I don&#39;t recall it ever making you immune to root. Correct if<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;&gt; wrong! =)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Another thing I found (to my dismay):  I was really excited when I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; got my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Screaming Mace. I know a bard using blunt weapons may sound<br/>\n&gt;&gt; strange, but if<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you look at the stats the Screamer is like a magical mino axe -<br/>\n&gt;&gt; same dmg,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; same speed, hits magical, and BONUS random Strength from it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Scream/Yaulp<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (I really liked this because you could stack it on top of EVERY<br/>\n&gt;&gt; other Str<br/>\n&gt;&gt; buff - I had like STR 175 or something with a shaman buffing me, my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; strength<br/>\n&gt;&gt; songs, some magic items, and the Scream).<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Well - it all sounds good, but I found that the Screamer causes<br/>\n&gt;&gt; your songs<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to go out of wack. When the Scream is in effect you can&#39;t sing. You<br/>\n&gt;&gt; start a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; song and it immediately ends with no effect. So I had to get rid of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; my mace<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (sigh).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll post if I find that any other items cause this effect. Also<br/>\n&gt;&gt; would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; appreciate if any other bards have experienced anything like this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; magical items - it would be nice to post. It was rather irritating<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to find<br/>\n&gt;&gt; this out after getting all the required components for the mace<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (what a damn<br/>\n&gt;&gt; annoying quest).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sartori of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
