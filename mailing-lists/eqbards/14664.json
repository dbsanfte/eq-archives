It is a longsword as stated below. The location<br/>\nand NPC that carries it is also correct. The proc is more of a 30DD and<br/>\n14dmg for 10 rounds based on its effect when the Tesch hit me with it. :)<br/>\n\tPersonally I think it makes for a great offhand weapon due to the proc for<br/>\ntwo reasons. First is that, inherently, poison based effects seem to be<br/>\nresisted less by mobs. Second is that one proc of this thing is equivalent<br/>\nto 2 procs from a Ykeshi (asuming that my numbers are correct ) which tends<br/>\nto get resisted more. I say it makes for a better offhand because the<br/>\ninfrequency of procs for the offhand weapon allows for the poison&#39;s full<br/>\ndamage potential.<br/>\n\tAnother reason is that there are so many melee types running around with<br/>\ndual Ykeshas. The Ykesha is supposed to have this unique look to it but<br/>\nthere are so many of them that a normal long sword is starting to look<br/>\nunique now. That, and I like the many &quot;Hey, what&#39;s that in your offhand?&quot;<br/>\nthat I get cause of it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Peck White [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peck_white@...\">peck_white@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 08, 2000 10:19 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] New Wep??
