Hmm, well I can just zone if it goes bad.  So, I<br/>\ntarget one and equip crude stein and sing charm:<br/>\n<br/>\nyour target is too far away...<br/>\nyour target is too far away...<br/>\nyou target is too far away...<br/>\nyou target is too far away...<br/>\n[ nothing ]<br/>\n[ nothing ]<br/>\n[ nothing ]<br/>\nyour target resists the Song of the Sirens spell...<br/>\n[ nothing ]<br/>\na grifon hits YOU for 64<br/>\na grifon hits YOU for 64<br/>\n<br/>\nRuh roh!  Time to start moving.  So then as I am heading to the Plains of<br/>\nthe Western Karana, I sees old Guard Frederick killing some corrupt lion and<br/>\nI train Merv onto poor old Guard Fred.  Well, old Fred starts whacking on<br/>\nMerv but Merv don&#39;t care about some lame greenie whacking at him and keeps<br/>\nchasing me.  So, I just keep on kiting and eventually Fred nibbles him down<br/>\nand KS&#39;s him off me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I am thinking, hmmm, I bet I could do this with a party member and we<br/>\nwould get he kill and the xp??? Might have to try it sometime.  I think that<br/>\nMerv might view things a little differently if a party member is slashing<br/>\nhis tail feathers or not?  Or charm Fred when he has Merv down to low health<br/>\n- I guess that would have worked too.  I was in a risk adverse mood right<br/>\nthen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe day before - we tried to take a SG in S. Ro (we were after Kililji<br/>\nplans.)  A lo 30&#39;s bard and a lo 30&#39;s necro and me at 38.  Well, things got<br/>\nall messed up and I was beat down to low hp and the other bard got killed<br/>\nand I was running for the zone.  For some reason, pathing problem or what<br/>\nnot, the SG got a free tele port right to me from half way across the zone.<br/>\nHit, hit, dead. Ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. ya, I know I had been warned!  But sheesh!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
