I personally prefer<br/>\nthe GeForce 2 because it&#39;s performance window is far higher and it offers a<br/>\nlot of features that games are now starting to support.  As of right now<br/>\nthere aren&#39;t many but the game industry is starting to support more and more<br/>\nfeatures that NVidia is offering.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the system is JUST for EQ I would get the Voodoo card since EQ was<br/>\nspecifically designed for Voodoo technology back when it was built (circa<br/>\n1997).  If you want to have the performance of the GeForce 2 on future<br/>\ngames, however, I&#39;d recommend the GeForce.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO:  GeForce is better bang for the buck.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wallace Elliott&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbe@...\">dbe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 26, 2000 12:21 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Video<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; A friend is in the market for a Video card.<br/>\n&gt; What is the best one out now for the price?<br/>\n&gt; Subjective Question, I know.
