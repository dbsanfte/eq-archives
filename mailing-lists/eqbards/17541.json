I disagree with the comparison to<br/>\nBaulder&#39;s Gate.  Yes you don&#39;t directly improve yourself by<br/>\npassing on items that someone else can use better.  But in the<br/>\nlong run, it is better for everyone if people cooperate like<br/>\nthis.  I won&#39;t get into a full blown discussion about the<br/>\nreasons why this is, but you can look it up on the web pretty<br/>\neasily.  Just do searchs for &quot;prisoner&#39;s dilemma&quot; and &quot;tragedy<br/>\nof the commons.&quot;  In a nutshell, both of these describe<br/>\nsituations where the most advantageous decision from an<br/>\nindividual standpoint results in the worst possible outcome<br/>\nfor all parties involved.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
