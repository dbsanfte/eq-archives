My part hunted <br/>\nMistmoore for the past 3 days and we hunt right at the zone.  Well...either <br/>\nMistmoore is bugged or my area song is hitting the npcs you hear casting <br/>\nthrough the walls, because we have had trouble with those same npcs coming to <br/>\nthe zone and killing us all when we did nothing to provoke them. The AoE <br/>\nsongs I used were fear, lull, and denon&#39;s. My only conclusion is that my song <br/>\nradius is reaching them, I tried to talk to a GM who just told me that higher <br/>\nlvl dungeons need a bit of tweaking.  If anyone has any other information I&#39;d <br/>\nlove to hear from you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nSummer Du&#39;Soleil<br/>\nBardess of Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
