They also do not get any<br/>\n&gt; &gt;instruments or weapons (other than their staff of guiding)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to weild. They apparently have a belt of something or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;another that gives them Spirit of Norrath. The guide you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;saw running around wasn&#39;t using Selo&#39;s or a drum..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well this is wrong from first hand experiance. After the <br/>\n&gt; first zone crash in the Plane of Fear (full spawn eeek!)<br/>\n&gt; we had a guide helping us by ressurecting and recovering<br/>\n&gt; our corpses for us. He would summon us to our corpse in<br/>\n&gt; the PoF and then do a ressurection. I thought this <br/>\n&gt; was damn odd, because he was a lvl 50 cleric guide and<br/>\n&gt; was using his lvl 49 spell to do this. And he had to<br/>\n&gt; meditate after each time. I have been ressurected<br/>\n&gt; before by our GM and he didnt med or cast, just zapped<br/>\n&gt; away. Maybe this was just a freak occurance, i dont know,<br/>\n&gt; but he definately had his spells :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Check out the &quot;leaked&quot; policies and procedures manual<br/>\nthat came out awhile ago. All guides use a cape of<br/>\nvashar or some like name to do resurrections. They do<br/>\nnot use spells. Granted, the cape may take mana for<br/>\nwhatever reason, but it&#39;s not a spell they&#39;re casting<br/>\nfrom their spellbook. GM&#39;s on the other hand may be<br/>\nable to do things differently since they&#39;re not as<br/>\nlimited as guides are in that they&#39;re actually employed<br/>\nby Verant and &#39;trusted&#39; so to speak with extra tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, the p&p as they call it is a very good thing<br/>\nthat all players should read in my opinion. It tells <br/>\nyou exactly what guides can and can&#39;t do and why. I<br/>\nknow I&#39;ve started looking at guides differently since<br/>\nI read it and know when not to bother them with something<br/>\nI know they aren&#39;t going to be able to fix because of<br/>\ntheir guidelines. It also gives a nifty look at the<br/>\ntools they get to use to do their duties.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
