Thanks for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn answer to your question, at level 23, perceptually, I was moving faster<br/>\nlast night than before the patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ronnie Roads [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rkroads@...\">rkroads@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 18, 2000 12:38 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Selo&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ronnie Roads &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rkroads@...\">rkroads@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerceptually Selo&#39;s is about 30% slower for me (level 50, Selo&#39;s drum) since<br/>\nthe<br/>\npatch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother 50th level bard with whom I spoke agreed and said he sent feedback.<br/>\nI sent<br/>\nfeedback and petitioned.  The GM who answered submitted a bug report.  I<br/>\nalso<br/>\ncontacted Shada and a few others to ask them if they noticed and to submit<br/>\nsomething<br/>\nif they had.<br/>\n<br/>\nI unfortunately have no hard baseline against which to compare.  Would<br/>\nsomeone who<br/>\ndoes please repeat a test?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a happier note and to address someone who asked about the minotaur hero:<br/>\nI<br/>\ncompleted the quest last night.  When I arrived in Steamfont a druid<br/>\ngentleman was<br/>\nwaiting for the hero and said he had been there 4 hours and missed the one<br/>\nspawn<br/>\nwhen he left briefly.  He soon logged and I was very fortunate because the<br/>\nhero<br/>\nspwaned when I had been there less than an hour.  So that is two heroes in<br/>\nabout 5<br/>\nhours.  I know people were camping Meldrath and I was killing minos in the<br/>\nmaze for<br/>\nsomething to do and with slight hope it would help.  Perhaps I was just very<br/>\nvery<br/>\nlucky; perhaps killing the minos did help.  Either way I am very pleased =).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh one other thing: GrimFeather drops lambent stones, did you know?<br/>\n<br/>\n//Maravana Vireo<br/>\n//50th Bard of Jus Divinum<br/>\n//Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
