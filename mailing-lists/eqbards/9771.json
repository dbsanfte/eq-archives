With how this song has been downgraded though you really do <br/>\nneed to keep it going continuously to be effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharm can be woven with other songs, but due to its random nature it is not <br/>\na good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Specifically, does Fulfils Curtailing NOT stack with any songs or other<br/>\n&gt;spells other players cast.  In fact that would be also a good addition to <br/>\n&gt;an<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my experience Curtailing chant does stack with the Enchanter MR debuffs.  <br/>\nI have never received any party members saying that they could not cast a <br/>\nspell on something that was under this songs influence.  Can you give an <br/>\nexample so I can include it in the song analysis?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;analysis matrix - what spells are not compatible with various songs and <br/>\n&gt;vice<br/>\n&gt;versa.

I did <br/>\nmention the snare breaks root, but should have mentioned that it can kill <br/>\ndarkness line DoT&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I mean some of these things I know - but is there a definitive collection <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;this knowledge?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;John, what can i say - lots of wisps and oh yeah lots and lots of fire<br/>\n&gt;beetles!! &lt;s&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt;Bard of the 35th Song<br/>\n&gt;&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n&gt;somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the info Sylly :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
