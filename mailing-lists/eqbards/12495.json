I am an elite foo bard.<br/>\n  At foo level you are like a god, so it really doesnt matter what<br/>\n  the song does.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Speaking of songs, someone told me at the Game Convention where<br/>\n  Verant released the expansion preview, they were showing the new<br/>\n  bard songs.  One song, deemed L75 or so, was a song that stopped<br/>\n  time in a zone.  Every second of time stop drained mana, but in<br/>\n  the duration, all NPCs would freeze.  Man, that would rock.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harm.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
