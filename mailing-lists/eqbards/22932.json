I doubt that they&#39;re going to put bind spots right in<br/>\nfront of most dungeons, instead, I think they&#39;re likely to just add a few<br/>\nspots in more central locations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of your guesses don&#39;t really seem logical. For example, Why bother with<br/>\na bind in Lfay when you can bind in Gfay? Having a bind 1 zone closer isn&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to increase MM trafic very much. Or WC? I doubt they&#39;d add a bind<br/>\npoint for a teenage dungeon especially when freeport is 2 zones away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they&#39;ll be aiming for mid level dungeons that are under used.<br/>\nDefinitely something near paw. Perhaps the stone bridge in SK or NK.<br/>\nSomething near unrest is possible, but not too likely seeing as how unrest<br/>\nis pretty well frequented. The other biggie would be something closer to the<br/>\nevil side of the world. Lake Rathe, Rathe Mountains, Cazic Thule,<br/>\nUpper/Lower Guk. The arena is a bindable zone, but that&#39;s still a long walk<br/>\nto cazic or guk.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly a bind near perma wouldn&#39;t help in the slightest. The reason people<br/>\ndon&#39;t go is because it&#39;s so hard to get to, not to fight in. The closest<br/>\nteleports are West karana near NK zone or Toxxula forrest. Neither of which<br/>\nare very close. Personally I&#39;d like to see a teleport ring or spire placed<br/>\nin permafrost to make that side of the world a little more accessable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther likely candidates are kunark zones. Something close to Howling Stones<br/>\nfor good races and something close to Kaesora for non lizards both come to<br/>\nmind.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nMinstrel of Karana<br/>\nTribunal Server<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 11:24 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bind Poll<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my guesses...<br/>\n<br/>\nVery likely:<br/>\nLavastorm (outside Solusek & Najena)<br/>\nSouth Karana (outside Paw)<br/>\nDagnor&#39;s Cauldron (perhaps anywhere)<br/>\nOcean of Tears (perhaps anywhere)<br/>\nLesser Faydark (outside Mistmoore)<br/>\nFeerott (outside Cazic Thule)<br/>\nInnothule Swamp (outside Guk)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot so likely:<br/>\nToxxulia (outside Paineel)<br/>\nErud&#39;s Crossing (at docks)<br/>\nWest Commons (outside Belfallen)<br/>\nEverfrost (outside Permafrost)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
