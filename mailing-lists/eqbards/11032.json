What bothers <br/>\nme is when I go to an area that was designed for my character&#39;s level, in order to <br/>\nearn an item that was intended to be used by my character&#39;s level, only to find it <br/>\ncamped by players 10-15 levels higher than me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs one of the modestly-developing players on my server (I started April 1st, and am <br/>\nonly level 34), it has always really irritated me to have zones that are intended <br/>\nfor players of my level cluttered with players who should have gone somewhere else, <br/>\nbut are too lazy or too chicken.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen those players are joined by players who are bored, and who are camping the <br/>\nareas in order to give items that I now cannot get to 5th level newbies, it ticks me <br/>\noff.  This is not a twinking problem, per se, it is due to the lack of things for <br/>\nlevel 50s to do.  Still, the net result is that I end up really resenting twinks who <br/>\nare wearing things that I should have been able to get, but cannot (because there <br/>\nare too many other people of much higher level than me, with much more time on their <br/>\nhands than I have, cluttering up the zones).  I know that the level 50s will say <br/>\nthat they have a right to do this, and they do.  It still stinks for me, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
