All of them now hate you.  You are right it is a<br/>\n&gt;programming thing but I think it&#39;s the way they want it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Part of this is seen when a party member gets bounced by a high level npc -<br/>\n&gt;like brigand or a gryf.  Once one party member gets on a hate list all party<br/>\n&gt;members are added especially if you are playing a song that is buffing them<br/>\n&gt;or whatever.  So everyone has to zone to clear the hate list otherwise the<br/>\n&gt;mob will come hunting all of the party members.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And I still think better tactics can mitigate your situation.  Don&#39;t pull<br/>\n&gt;all of them (a cleric can lull some of them and you wont get 4 hitting on<br/>\n&gt;you - only 2 :-) - I suppose your tanks don&#39;t mind because they can take all<br/>\n&gt;of them no problemo but all of them will attack you if you are in their<br/>\n&gt;sight.  Might be interesting to see just how far away you have to be before<br/>\n&gt;they don&#39;t come to you instead of the tanks.  I know they will run around a<br/>\n&gt;couple tanks if you are near but I wonder what would happen if you were<br/>\n&gt;outside of the range where you can read the icons?  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone in your party have camo?
