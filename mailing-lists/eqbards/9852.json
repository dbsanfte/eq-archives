There were only a<br/>\n&gt; handful of people in the zone so we decided to pull the mobs back to the<br/>\n&gt; zone and fight there.  On one occasion, I pulled two familiars that we were<br/>\n&gt; handling just fine.  Out of nowhere, a flouting gargoyle appeared.  None of<br/>\n&gt; the other people in the zone were nearby so I know for a fact they didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; lead the gargoyle to us.  At the time the garg appeared, the necro was over<br/>\n&gt; 75% health.  In an instant, he got zapped by something and was killed.  He<br/>\n&gt; checked his text window to see what zapped him but couldn&#39;t find an<br/>\n&gt; explanantion.  Later on, I made a similar pull.  This time I got three<br/>\n&gt; familiars by mistake.  They all attacked me so I started to sing Lullaby and<br/>\n&gt; put them to sleep.  Once again, out of nowhere, three flouting gargoyles<br/>\n&gt; appeared right on top of us.  I was around 60% health at the time.  Before I<br/>\n&gt; had a chance to even start running to the zone, I got zapped and was knocked<br/>\n&gt; from 60% to dead in one shot.  Like the necro earlier, there weren&#39;t any<br/>\n&gt; text messages to indicate I should have taken that much damage in one shot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am inclined to believe that our deaths were a result of a bug, which I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; told sometimes occurs in MM.  First off, the gargs spawned right next to the<br/>\n&gt; zone, which I am almost certain shouldn&#39;t have occured.  Everyone in the<br/>\n&gt; zone were in their 20s and camping around the lake.  I don&#39;t know where<br/>\n&gt; flouting gargoyles normally spawn, but I would assume nowhere near where<br/>\n&gt; everyone was pulling from (the pathway leading to the graveyard).  I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think of any reason how the flouting gargs got to the zone except due to a<br/>\n&gt; bug.  Second, the text messages did not indicate I got hit by a spell, which<br/>\n&gt; could have accounted for losing 60% of my health in one shot.  Even if I did<br/>\n&gt; get hit by a spell, the damage that familiars can do in one shot (usually<br/>\n&gt; with Force Shock), shouldn&#39;t be over 400 hit points.  I did get hit for<br/>\n&gt; physical damage by the gargs but not enough to do 400 hit points of health,<br/>\n&gt; which was about what I had when they appeared.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else had similar deaths in MM? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; 26 bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaty Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.           <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\nCS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
