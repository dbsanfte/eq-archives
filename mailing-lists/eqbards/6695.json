I believe this<br/>\n&gt;is used on other servers as well. Unfortunately, as the Bard is known as<br/>\n&gt;a mediocre fighter and inadequate tank at that point, and the weapons we<br/>\n&gt;can use are all weapons multiple classes can use because we have no bard<br/>\n&gt;only weapons, there will always be someone in the group who could use<br/>\n&gt;the item more than the bard. Why would a group want to give the first<br/>\n&gt;Ykesha they find to a bard, who can&#39;t double attack and thus won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt;making as effective use of this special weapon as a warrior or ranger.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*SNIP*<br/>\n<br/>\nWell you could always resort to extoration *evil grin*.
