I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>\nquestion is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory slots, and #2 bank<br/>\nset up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, switch to #1, switch<br/>\nout weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new song without<br/>\nmissing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one of those things<br/>\nthat just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to switch hotkey<br/>\nbanks...<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, btw, play with people 8 levels lower than you!  I played with a monk my<br/>\nlevel and a warrior 8 levels higher.  He went through 40 in the same amount<br/>\nof time it took us to go through 34 (about 3.5 hours).
