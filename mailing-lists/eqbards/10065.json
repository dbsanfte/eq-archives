For your","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-275206613\">so, you say because I am level 22, you have played everquest as a bard<br/>\nlonger than I have? Perhaps you have, but that does not mean you are<br/>\nspecial. For your information, I have played Martyn as a bard since Day one,<br/>\nAnd even phase 3 beta. If you have played longer than that, good for you.<br/>\n(applauds)<br/>\nMy works schedule fluxuates, not to mention I am in no race to make level<br/>\n50. which explains my level 22 self. I esplore, I goof around. I sing songs<br/>\nin concert. I roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing level 40 whatever doesnt make you better than me.<br/>\nnor anyone else.<br/>\nthat is the tone I objected to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a level 22 bard is wearing bronze Breasplate, bronze bracers, bronze<br/>\nboots. blackened iron arms, and legs. and some bit of leather.<br/>\nI was in leather until level 16, when I replaced it with some expensive<br/>\nbronze. and then the BI, when I visited runnyeye<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said. I am not a twink. The only thing I have ever been given is a<br/>\nbarbed whip and some advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is some advice of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nbe more respectful to others. jt because you are anonymouse on the net<br/>\ndoesnt give you the right to treat others like dirt<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, November 14, 1999 2:43 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Lambent<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I did not like your tone, sir. you assume that I am a low level -twink-<br/>\n&gt; well, sorry to say, mister know it all, that I am a level 22 bard, and<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; is my ONLY damn character. for you to go say &quot;Well, you don&#39;t -deserve- it<br/>\n&gt; then&quot; is typical elitist attitude that is starting to drive me away from<br/>\n&gt; this game. What gives you the right to judge me?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ((I hate to be the one to say this... but you don&#39;t deserve it then.))<br/>\n<br/>\n  My comment stands.  However, I apologize for the seemingly lack of<br/>\n  respect, but you&#39;ve got to realize I&#39;ve played this game<br/>\n  as a bard longer than you have -- and I hear all the L20 bards<br/>\n  complaining because the Lambent quests are too hard.  The fact<br/>\n  that they think they should get Lambent because they are something<br/>\n  special, irritates me.  I worked really hard for my armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My point was I wish all bards had to work for their armor, cause<br/>\n  it doesn&#39;t get any better until level 46.  I dont whine that I<br/>\n  cannot get the Plane armor yet, so I&#39;m working as hard as I<br/>\n  can to become of level to travel and earn it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Plus, I never called you a twink.  You put those words in my mouth<br/>\n  Mr. Level 22 Bard hehe.  So what does a L22 bard wear nowadays?<br/>\n<br/>\n  You posted to this list looking for advice, and I gave it to you.<br/>\n  I&#39;m sorry it wasn&#39;t what you wanted to hear.  If you want Lambent<br/>\n  armor, you need to take some risks and quest for it, or pay the<br/>\n  piper.  I don&#39;t know what else to tell you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic, Mister Know it All, Bard<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
