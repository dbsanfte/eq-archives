My<br/>\nGuildmates love the place and have been spending a lot of time there.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure if something changed (patch-wise or our tactics) but the first<br/>\nseveral times I was there everything went great.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLast week - when I&#39;m around they seem to go Aggro like Songer described.<br/>\nThis is fighting near the Hornets nest.  Every time I grouped in BW I died<br/>\nat least once - once twice.  And it&#39;s a tough zone to find a rez.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI&#39;m sticking to Outside Fironia.  I&#39;ve only died there twice - both times<br/>\nbasically my fault.  Once when away from group on a corpse locate - and<br/>\nanother when we only had 4 in group - and I thought I could run to zone -<br/>\nwhen Paladin would have LoH - but I was too far away..<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnyway - the loot is possibly better in BW - I once looted a 51 Wizard<br/>\nspell (lost it in lotto) - the best I&#39;ve seen outside Karnor&#39;s is a Black<br/>\nPearl..<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde 43 of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
