Maybe I wasn&#39;t clear, I meant the widgets are<br/>\non named all over the same dungeon, thus making pulling them to one room<br/>\nimpossible.  I see a dungeon like Upper Guk (dont know lower, my highest<br/>\nlvl char is 20 and  played him last in June) with maybe 8 named mobs<br/>\nspread all over the place.  No way you could pull them through all the<br/>\nother stuff (and survive).
