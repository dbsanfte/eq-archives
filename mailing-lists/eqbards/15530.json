Following is the list I have <br/>\nso far.  Because the nature of one or two of these as spoilers, I&#39;m giving <br/>\nsome spoiler space.  Note: The pictures of coordinates underneath many <br/>\nzones does not count, what I&#39;m looking for are mostly &quot;pop-culture&quot; <br/>\nreferences or things that are just downright silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nS<br/>\nP<br/>\nO<br/>\nI<br/>\nL<br/>\nE<br/>\nR<br/>\n<br/>\nS<br/>\nP<br/>\nA<br/>\nC<br/>\nE<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\nRegional Eggs:<br/>\nOf course, the original and classic: Qeynos = SonyEQ backwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, the runes on the side of the Qeynos Clocktower, when translated, <br/>\nsay two things:  Ak&#39;anon Gnomes, and Qeynos.  Both are spelled backward, <br/>\nand in Tolkein-style runes.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Estate of Unrest&quot; - which is a homonym for &quot;A state of unrest&quot; - which one <br/>\ncould say all of the residents are in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the walls of Blackburrow (and other places) you can see the &quot;fossilized&quot; <br/>\nskeleton of the Alien from Alien.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderneath Befallen, there is a picture of a cat&#39;s head.  This is supposed <br/>\nto belong to one of the programmers.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter Eggs:<br/>\n<br/>\nBait Masterson - this is a reference to William Barclay &quot;Bat&quot; Masterson, <br/>\nthe American frontier lawman known for his good looks and ivory-handled <br/>\npistols.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrincess Lenya/Lenia.  If you hail Lenya, she says &quot;Aren&#39;t you a little <br/>\nshort for a High Keep Guard?&quot;  This is a reference to Princess Leia in Star <br/>\nWars.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuards Regis(?) and Philbin in the Qeynos area.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard that is at the fountain in South Karana is named Vhalen which could be <br/>\ninterpreted as an abbreviation for Van Halen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bard that you get the good sell prices from in Freeport is named Jekel <br/>\nEnheid (unverified)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, the four characters who stand around the campfire - <br/>\nwhen the High Elf attacks, he shouts &quot;Fabulous Four, attack!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCubert is the name of a Gelatinous Cube under Qeynos.

This is unverified.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhrase to say to to Kizdean Gix to get the note for Lrodd is &quot;utalk adarev <br/>\notcin&quot;. This is a misspelling of the quote from the movie, &quot;The Day the <br/>\nEarth Stood Still.&quot;  The words spelled backwards are &quot;klatu verada nicto&quot;, <br/>\nwhich is close to the actual quote: &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay guys - let&#39;s see what you have!<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Ponderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
