I&#39;ve also noticed that<br/>\n&gt; many of the posts sound unsatisfied with the bard character.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One thing you&#39;ll notice on this (or just about any other mailing list or<br/>\nmessage board) is that people tend to be more vocal with their complaints.<br/>\nWhen things are going well, mum&#39;s the word.<br/>\n<br/>\nCase in point: a recent patch had two Bard-related changes.  The first gave us<br/>\nmeditate at level 10 which allows us to memorize our songs much much quicker.<br/>\nBefore this, going from dead to ready seemed to take forever.  It allowed us<br/>\nto memorize during battle if necessary.  It was something bards have been<br/>\nasking for since day 1.  There was one post praising the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the same patch, the animation of a Bard was changed when we play an<br/>\ninstrument and run.  Now, instead of surfing along the ground, we waddle along<br/>\nlike Charlie Chaplin at the end of CITY LIGHTS.  The number of posts was<br/>\nstaggering with complaints and cries of &quot;Verant doesn&#39;t care!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, a Bard&#39;s life changes from level to level.  The changes can be<br/>\nstaggering, more so than just about any class.  For example, I died at level<br/>\n22 probably more than any other level.  At level 23, I didn&#39;t die at all.  My<br/>\nadvice to you is to play your bard until it becomes tedious rather than fun.<br/>\nThen switch to something else.  Hate the poor melee?  Try a warrior.  Hate<br/>\nrunning 15 zones to get to your corpse?  Play a caster.  The Bard isn&#39;t for<br/>\neverybody.  Hopefully, you&#39;ll stay with our ranks...it&#39;s a fun ride!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
