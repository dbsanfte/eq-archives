Here is a summary of <br/>\nwhat we found out.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing a level 40th Bard:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Lullaby is designed so that there is a 25% resist rate on level 1 <br/>\ncreatures, and a 35% resist rate on creatures that con White to a 40th level <br/>\nBard. This rate decreases with increasing Charisma<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Lullaby is a 1 (to about 1.5) tick song. It is not effective when twisted <br/>\nwith another song. If you plan to use this song as an Area Mezmerize, use <br/>\nONLY this song. The length is about 3-5 seconds long only.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The main error we found was that there is no actual text message being <br/>\ndisplayed telling you the creature has resisted your Lullaby. Therefore you <br/>\nwill only see a &quot;Head nods&quot; for your previous attempt then on the next <br/>\n&#39;tick&#39; the creature (IF it resists) just attacks with no &quot;Target has <br/>\nresisted your song&quot;. This is the actual problem that caused bards to think <br/>\nthat creatures were attacking even while their heads were &#39;nodded&#39;. Refer to <br/>\n#1 in that the effect only lasts for 3-5 seconds (1 tick worth).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome personal observations:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The song has a LARGE radius. I am attaching a screenshot of the range <br/>\nthat was being affectected by GZ (Geoff the Bard in the screenshot).<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The song seems quite effective as long as one remembers it is NOT a <br/>\nmultiple-tick song. Only 1 tick, so you have to keep singing it constantly <br/>\nfor the continuous effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to GZ especially and the other bards who showed up!<br/>\n<br/>\nHarliquinn Whiteshadow, wondering who has that name on Veeshan!?!?<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nand another thing...<br/>\nby melld  posted 1/11/00 8:08:51 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nNice Screenshot, Harli. Gallanite is my bard for the day on there. I&#39;ve made <br/>\na copy as a souvenier.<br/>\n<br/>\nGZ dropped several interesting tidbits during the test, and during a chat <br/>\nbeforehand. The one that caught my attention is that the new song should be <br/>\nup in a week or two if it passes testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It provides some protection from magic, but not the MR way&quot; is how I <br/>\nremember the quote.<br/>\n<br/>\nServo. The song is continuous, but when you stop, it only lasts three or <br/>\nfour seconds longer. Hence its no good for twisting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelld<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nNew song, quote from GZ...<br/>\nby H´┐¢bus  posted 1/12/00 4:08:25 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nHere s the quote from my log :<br/>\n<br/>\n[Wed Jan 12 01:34:01 2000] Geoff says, &#39;Next song helps protect you from <br/>\nspells in a compeletely non MR way&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone want my log of the test email me at : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trollhebus@...\">trollhebus@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nH´┐¢bus<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nre: GZ Lullaby Tests completed on Veeshan<br/>\nby Nindar  posted 1/11/00 8:36:34 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the chat before hand GZ mentioned that the resist should be lower once <br/>\nthe creature was mez&#39;d. Not sure if that was the case. I&#39;ll post up the data <br/>\nand try to do a little bit of analysis tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note: GZ had a different client than us. He actually does play a <br/>\nbard and is in his mid 30&#39;s, but he has always seen a resist message.<br/>\nHe seemed pretty pissed off when he found out that the resist wasn&#39;t <br/>\nshowing.<br/>\n<br/>\nand in case you&#39;re reading this, thanks again Geoff<br/>\n<br/>\nNindar (Still wondering about hearing 40 DINGs at once)<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAdditional instruments<br/>\nby Nindar  posted 1/11/00 8:43:11 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nAs anothe side note, GZ said that Kelin&#39;s practice lute and the small brass <br/>\ntrumpet are both in the game, you just have to look hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this another Fiery avenger? I have noticed that a few wierd people sell <br/>\nbardic instruments (Krak in South Karana??) so maybe you need good faction <br/>\nwith some of them to get a quest?<br/>\n<br/>\nNindar<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nmelldman<br/>\nStation Member   posted 01-11-2000 07:45 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for taking the time to do the test GZ. And for the interesting <br/>\nsurrounding discussion. Suprised more people didn&#39;t turn up, but I guess it <br/>\nis work time on the West coast.<br/>\nFor those who missed it. The results as I understand them were.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) A resist message is missing. This is missleading. It will be fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Lull only lasts one tick. Many bards expect it to be three. Don&#39;t twist.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Minimum resist on any mob is about 25%. About 35% on whites, much higher <br/>\non reds. Good charisma lowers the chance of resist.<br/>\n<br/>\nGallanite<br/>\nTemporary test bard<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
