Don t know the details of the quest, but you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-530699238\">The following happened recently on E&#39;ci.<br/>\n<br/>\nA group of folks were in the Hole to help someone with their epic quest.<br/>\nDon&#39;t know the details of the quest, but you have to talk/give something to<br/>\none of the NPCs there.  So a cleric by mistake aggroed the quest NPC.  If<br/>\nthe groups killed the mob, they wouldn&#39;t be able to complete that portion of<br/>\nthe quest.  So no one else attacked the NPC while it was beating up on the<br/>\ncleric.  Since no one else was on the NPC&#39;s hate list, once the cleric died<br/>\nthe NPC would not be aggro anymore and they could finish the quest.  The<br/>\ncleric (59th level with an AC over 1100) thought he might have a chance of<br/>\nsurviving if he went LD.  So he turned on autoattack and then typed in /quit<br/>\nto go LD.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow here is where the funny part starts.  The cleric had Complete Heal<br/>\nloaded in the first spell gem.  Apparently when you go linkdead, the game<br/>\nautomatically switches you over to NPC AI.  If you can cast spells,<br/>\napparently the only one the AI will cast is whichever one is loaded in the<br/>\nfirst spell gem.  So as everyone else watched the NPC beat on the cleric,<br/>\nevery once in a while (when he wasn&#39;t stunned) the cleric was able to get a<br/>\nCH spell off.  He was able to cast CH enough that he didn&#39;t die before his<br/>\ncharacter disappeared from the server.  To say the least he was quite<br/>\npleased when he discovered he didn&#39;t die after going LD.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I was wondering is could bards use this knowledge to somehow help us<br/>\nsurvive a fight after we go linkdead.  Fear sounds like a good option but<br/>\nthen again it could potentially screw over the rest of the group by causing<br/>\na train.  The new Shield of Songs is a possibility as well.  Third option<br/>\nwould be whatever song that you think would best help your party kill the<br/>\nmob(s) you were attacking before you went LD.  That would be situationally<br/>\ndependent on where you were fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone got other suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
