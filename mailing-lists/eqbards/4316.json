I was camping the Mucktail site<br/>\n&gt; with a level 29 cleric.  While we were waiting, we start to see messages<br/>\n&gt; scroll through &quot;Cytodl Krish begins to cast a spell&quot;.  Next thing we know<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; get attacked by a high level DE necro.  He conned red to me (19 bard) and<br/>\n&gt; blue to the 29 cleric.  Because we were totally caught by surprise, we<br/>\n&gt; both<br/>\n&gt; had to make a run for the Keep zone.  We fully recharged and went out<br/>\n&gt; looking for him.  I was singing invis and had elemental and purifying<br/>\n&gt; ryhthms ready to weave.  We finally found the necro wandering around the<br/>\n&gt; zone, with a bunch of corpses in his wake.  We attacked at the cleric<br/>\n&gt; tried<br/>\n&gt; rooting him several times. He kept resisting and the cleric was OOM (oops,<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; used an acronym).  We had to run to the border again.  We recharged and<br/>\n&gt; tracked him down once again.  The second time, the cleric just kept<br/>\n&gt; smiting<br/>\n&gt; him and we eventually killed him.  All told did over 800 damage to him.<br/>\n&gt; He<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t drop any loot which was a disappointment.  When we killed him, the<br/>\n&gt; factions affected, which all got worse, were The Dead, King and Queen of<br/>\n&gt; some wierd name, Keepers of the Art, and Eldritch Collective.  After the<br/>\n&gt; fight, we asked around if anyone had ever seen/heard of this NPC before.<br/>\n&gt; No<br/>\n&gt; one in the zone had heard of him.  Was wondering if anyone on this list<br/>\n&gt; could shed some light on his background?  Also wanted to warn everyone in<br/>\n&gt; case they ran into him and they were less level 30 they should be prepared<br/>\n&gt; to run. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW, by the way he was acting, almost 100% certain it wasn&#39;t a GM<br/>\n&gt; controlled<br/>\n&gt; NPC.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci   <br/>\n&gt; CPT Tom Reece<br/>\n&gt; G4 Maintenance Officer<br/>\n&gt; 655-4978<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enjoy 120+ unique music channels right from your desktop!
