It lasts longer and leaves you (the<br/>\nbard) free to play other songs to buff your party.<br/>\n<br/>\nLullaby really shines when you get a seemingly overwhelming<br/>\ntrain that&#39;ll send any enchanter running like a schoolgirl.  <br/>\nMy friends and I were tackling trains of 6-10 goblins in<br/>\nPermafrost this weekend.  I asked the one cleric in the group<br/>\nwhat her mana was after each fight.  50%, 30%, and 40%.  She<br/>\nbasically tossed 1-3 heals at me during the fight, and maybe<br/>\nanother heal at one other party member.  I don&#39;t think anyone<br/>\nelse lost more than 2 bubbles (and then only because of<br/>\nmultiple spellcasting goblins).  We were regularly taking on<br/>\n3-4 goblins and the cleric was getting bored because between<br/>\nLullaby and Hymn (you *can* weave the two, though it depends<br/>\non how resistant the mobs are - experiment), she only had to<br/>\ntoss in one or two lesser heals during a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one time we got overwhelmed (I think it was 15 goblins), I<br/>\nhit lullaby, gave our overloaded cleric (our loot collector)<br/>\ntime to gate out, gave everyone else a head start, then I hit<br/>\nScreech and ran for the zone.  (Screech by the way does not<br/>\nhave the 4 mob limit I&#39;d mistakenly thought it did earlier.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; pass the raider camp (all green and a couple blue cons), I go can we try out<br/>\n&gt; my sleepy song.  So, eveyone - me 16, enchanter 18, ranger 17, & druid 18<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First off, - them green and blues - were lots of them.  And bunches of them<br/>\n&gt; were casters.  So to answer your question - what is worst is a swarm of<br/>\n&gt; green casters!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Green casters get higher priority than yellow melee mobs in my<br/>\nbook.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Second - I fired up the song and played my lute but the mistake was running<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure how much more effective the song is with a lute.<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed little if any difference, but that may be because<br/>\nmy charisma is 120.  Perhaps some of the other bards have seen<br/>\na difference?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; down to them to start the attack.  I should have attacked the edges and<br/>\n&gt; pulled on one - then if the whole camp jumped me at least they would be<br/>\n&gt; close and under the spell.  As it was - I attacked then got them mad and<br/>\n&gt; casting without getting close enough to put them all to sleep.  Only a<br/>\n&gt; couple came over to fight - the rest just stood off and casted on us and<br/>\n&gt; buffed their buddies.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Spellcasters have this annoying habit of standing in place and<br/>\ncasting at you after you&#39;ve pulled the melee mobs away.  So<br/>\nnormally you want to attack where the spellcasters are<br/>\nstanding.  This is complicated at the raider camp in NK<br/>\nbecause when they flee, they run into the water, and you can&#39;t<br/>\ncast at or attack them unless you&#39;re also underwater.  My take<br/>\non the situation would be (depending on number of casters) to<br/>\npull the melee mobs out of the casters&#39; aggro radius, then<br/>\nhave the enchanter memblur the casters.  When you&#39;ve finished<br/>\nthe melee mobs, then tackle the casters separately.<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
