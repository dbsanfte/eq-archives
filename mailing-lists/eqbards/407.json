I was wandering around<br/>\n&gt; the frigid north, new to the area, sort of bored, why not, eh?  There was<br/>\n&gt; one fellow who knew what bards could do, he was the one I think who<br/>\npressed<br/>\n&gt; for my services (I could tell by the ooos and ahhs from the others when my<br/>\n&gt; turbo drum overcharge kicked in).  After a few battles, he took me aside<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; told me he should maybe &quot;explain&quot; to me how bards worked, &quot;The bard buffs<br/>\n&gt; are worthless.&quot;  ???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He just wanted two songs, and only two: accelerado and hymn of<br/>\nrestoration,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;the only worthwhile bard songs.&quot;  What I did?  I laughed in his face.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then I explained to him how MAGES should work: Stated I actually hated<br/>\n&gt; waiting around for five minutes as he recharged after every skirmish with<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; gnoll pup, so he shouldn&#39;t do anything at all--nada / zilch / stand there<br/>\n&gt; stiff / do nothing--except in dire emergencies!  Told him a mage<br/>\n&gt; should--never--cast spells (except for a pet), until that rare time the<br/>\n&gt; battle is turning for the worse.  This will keep us alive, I explained, so<br/>\n&gt; he will have full mana available if we get jumped or overwhelmed.  First,<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ll move from monster to monster quicker for better experience, second,<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; avoid sitting around in dangerous areas, third, when things go bad he&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; have maximum firepower.  That shut him up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Like he&#39;s about to follow us around doing absolutely nothing during most<br/>\n&gt; battles, even if it insured the survival of the group!  Needless to say,<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &quot;buff&quot; songs continued!  And the Hymn was played at the proper time!  And<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure he cast his spells at the proper time, actually, for I only<br/>\n&gt; pretended to know how to do his job, but in retrospect it does make a lot<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; sense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keep this in mind: it&#39;s your character, not the leader&#39;s.  Personally, if<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; find myself in a group with a bad &quot;general,&quot; I either disobey (and see how<br/>\n&gt; he reacts) and/or leave.  You can be arrogant, see,  because you are a<br/>\nBARD,<br/>\n&gt; special, who needs the rest of them, eh?  Any other group would happily<br/>\ngrab<br/>\n&gt; me up!  Ever hear a bard shout to &quot;join a group&quot; more than Once?  Hah!<br/>\n&gt; Never believe anybody knows more about being a bard than you do, because<br/>\n&gt; they may have played a bard but not--Your--bard!  And you&#39;re in demand,<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t take no nonsense, you can be choosey!  Any group that can&#39;t use a<br/>\nbard<br/>\n&gt; has never been with a bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Roop<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And besides, you&#39;re really singing the songs about the glory of your<br/>\ngroup,<br/>\n&gt; who wants to sing songs of glory to a bunch of nimrods?

As mentioned in  previous reply, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bards are actually very good soloists.  When things get hairy, we have<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; accellerando  - a near full-proff excape route.  In the situation you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; described, if I was getting hit hard and hit a lot, I&#39;d hit<br/>\naccellerando<br/>\n&gt; &gt;at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I lasted about 15 seconds.  I tried my damndest to get accell - but kept<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; &gt;getting stunned...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;While I was stunned the two cents and the legionaire were hitting me..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about 3 bars of health.  This is because you slow down below 2 bars and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; may need that extra bar to get some distance between you and the orcs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Always have accellerando hot-keyed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Stupid me - didn&#39;t know you can hot-key a spell...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Second, lament is a great spell but it can, as you have learned, fail.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; However, the lower the level of creature is compared to you, the more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;likely<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it is to succeed.  Never use it on a white or higher con.  It will fail<br/>\n&gt; &gt;way<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; too often.  But, if they all con green or a low blue, you could solo a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;camp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and clean it out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I didn&#39;t realize they &quot;fixed&quot; that spell.  When I first got it - it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;working.  Was soloing an orc camp in Lesser Feydark - (with a bunch of<br/>\nhigh<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level guys - no prob that time) - and it didn&#39;t work.  I recall comments<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this list about it.  If there were comments that it was fixed - I must<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; &gt;missed it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Third, our greatest power is in grouping, but grouping is risky.  It is<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; high-trust situation.  Be very careful who you group with and guage how<br/>\n&gt; &gt;well<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you can trust them.  I might group with a group like you had described,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I would not trust them to save my butt if I got in trouble and at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;first<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sign of trouble, I&#39;d run.  Only when they have shown that they can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; counted on to keep me alive when the going got rough would I let myself<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; low in health.  I die more frequently in a group then solo because I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; still too trusting and eager to jump into danger to save someone whose<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stupidity got them into trouble... usually failing and dieing along<br/>\nside<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Well the biggest thing I learned - not to listen to non-bards about what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;song to use.  The leader of the group (who seemed to know what he was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;doing) - asked me to turn on the dischord song before starting to fight.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;should have trusted my own instincts than listen to someone else...  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;usually start with a buff song - and switch when I feel it&#39;s appropriate.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Be up front with them about this though.  Make sure they understand<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; since you don&#39;t know them well, and your life is dear to you, you will<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; what you have to to protect it until some trust and teamwork has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;developed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I appreciate the advice.  Live and learn (or in this case - Die and<br/>\nLearn!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Getting Stunned is clearly the biggest problem we face in combat!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Slyde<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Looking for an efficient, fun way to stay in touch with family members?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Create a ONElist community just for your family!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Tired of empty chat rooms and out of date bulletin boards?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist: Making the Internet Intimate<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
