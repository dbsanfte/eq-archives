Before tossing some ideas into the<br/>\nlion&#39;s den, he should have checked with the spell gurus or at least someone<br/>\nin-house that plays a Bard. It sounds like he even spoke with GZ about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he did check, it&#39;s safe to assume the spell guys don&#39;t know how some Bard<br/>\nsongs interact with each other and/or they don&#39;t have a Bard of sufficient<br/>\nlevel in-house to verify that twisting Invis with anything else doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n-KS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSecure online gaming at William Hill Casino.
