Sure he died quite a few times and many of them<br/>\n&gt;before anyone even heard of a lvl 49 res, but I spent days with very little<br/>\n&gt;exp movement after 45 or so. [The necromancer] on other hand has officially<br/>\n&gt;passed [the paladin]up exp wise. Get this in 29 days played, 4 of those<br/>\n&gt;camping Pyzin. I think I may have 1 or 2 days in group time, which cutts exp<br/>\n&gt;in half at least. That adds up to less than 25 days to go from 1 to 54 for a<br/>\n&gt;necro and 128 hard core cant leave your pc days for the pally.
