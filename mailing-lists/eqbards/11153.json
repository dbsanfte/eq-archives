I had been ranting about the bard&#39;s AC penalty on our imbrued armor.. didn&#39;t think<br/>\nanyone gave half a crap but at least the changes were made.<br/>\nI can only bash Verant so much in one day... but why is our stuff suddenly dropping now when they were<br/>\nquoted on saying something like &quot;after extensive testing, we&#39;ve determined that imbrued armor is still<br/>\ndropping&quot; before the patch. That was posted on EQ Casters I believe after the issue was raised that our<br/>\narmor hadn&#39;t been dropping.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you guys out there with full suits of imbrued might tell us of the ac bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nSteelWolf wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: SteelWolf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwolf@...\">steelwolf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good news - the imbrued plate dropped in the alter planes for Bards has<br/>\n&gt; received an upgrade in AC for several pieces.
