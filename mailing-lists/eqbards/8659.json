Be creative, I can do 2 HG&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;within about 8 minutes, Im sure you could do better than that :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t mean to sound condescending, but I don&#39;t believe you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At level 30 you are lucky if you can solo anything white+.<br/>\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t reliably do clops until level 34ish.  Your songs<br/>\n&gt; just wont stick on a monster at least _FIVE_ levels higher<br/>\n&gt; than you.  I guess if you hit it right, and got lucky --<br/>\n&gt; you could chain+bellow the thing, but that&#39;s gonna take about<br/>\n&gt; 20 mins to kill.  If you were refering to charming the HGs,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried it at 39 and it&#39;s very risky, a few resists and<br/>\n&gt; you could die pretty easily.  I used charm extensively around<br/>\n&gt; level 30 in highkeep versus red raiders, and it lasted at most<br/>\n&gt; 5 seconds, sometimes less.  Chains+fear on an HG is futile,<br/>\n&gt; I cannot even do it at level 39.  They still resist too much.<br/>\n&gt; And if he hits me a few times, hp bubbles vanish.  I have<br/>\n&gt; gotten lucky, mind you.  But I tend to lean toward statistics<br/>\n&gt; rather than luck, because in the end you will pay the piper.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Goodness...its really not that risky at all.  I&#39;ve been killing giants<br/>\nsince 29 - when I started, there would be some too high for<br/>\nme, charm wouldn&#39;t stick, and I&#39;d have to zone, but since 32<br/>\nor so, if I see two giants, a few minutes later they&#39;ll be at least<br/>\none less. :) (Depending on how weakened the victor of the battle<br/>\nis, its sometimes more efficient to zone rather than  kite him down.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for songs not sticking, yes, they do resist a lot.  But, we have<br/>\nthis handy song called selos, and charm has a *huge* range.  Just<br/>\nstand way back, sing it, if he resists, run back and try again.   Once<br/>\nit sticks, swing underneath him (this is the dangerous part), so you&#39;re<br/>\nin  range for him to hear your commands, target the second giant<br/>\nthat you hopefully arranged to be nearby, have your new pet charge<br/>\nin to battle, hit F1 twice to retarget your pet, and you&#39;re all set.  As<br/>\nsoon as they rush you, recharm the pet, and back they go to swinging<br/>\nat each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for dying, I don&#39;t think I have yet...Though I&#39;ve come *way* too<br/>\nclose, mostly because of lag or having to steer my dueling fools around<br/>\nlowbies in the area.  But even at a half a bubble of health, without a MMB,<br/>\nI still barely outran them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep selos up at all times when you do this, of course.  My standard twist<br/>\nis charm-selos-selo.  At 35 charm will pretty much stick the full duration<br/>\non blue giants, so I don&#39;t have to do much running anymore, but only an idiot<br/>\nwill open himself up to a round of attacks from two pissed of giants if he can<br/>\nhelp it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lohengrin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
