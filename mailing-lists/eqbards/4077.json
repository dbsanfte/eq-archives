Just<br/>\nremember, there will *always* be something bigger and meaner<br/>\nthan you in this game for you to fight.  While advancing<br/>\nquickly may inflate your ego (and I don&#39;t mean that in a<br/>\nderogatory way), it deprives you of time to explore and<br/>\nexperience things meant for people your current level, good<br/>\nand bad.  Some day, a level 15 player will gaze at your level<br/>\n45 awesomeness, and ask you for advice, and you will be unable<br/>\nto give him any because at his level you had equipment way<br/>\nbeyond his means.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never did understand people who paid $49.95 for Diablo, then<br/>\nimmediately hacked themselves 50th level characters.  If you<br/>\nsell the crown and buy yourself full bronze armor, a barbed<br/>\nwhip, and dragoon dirk, I predict you will be very very bored<br/>\nfor the next 10-15 levels because the only thing you&#39;ll have<br/>\nto look forward to is leveling.  Just about everything dropped<br/>\nby stuff you fight until you reach about level 25 is going to<br/>\nbe inferior to the equipment you bought at level 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion.  To each his own.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
