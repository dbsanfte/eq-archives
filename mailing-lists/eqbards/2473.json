And the big problem here is hauling stuff around is a lot<br/>\nmore of an issue at lower levels when you need money the most and the<br/>\ngood strength enhancing items are out of your reach. I was still wearing<br/>\na spiked collar at L30 for the extra +3 str it gave me and my half elf<br/>\nbard has a base strenth of 98. At later levels loot and money become way<br/>\nless of an issue unless you are trying to train the jewelry skill, so<br/>\nmost people end up leaving those fine steel morning stars lying on the<br/>\nground rather than carrying them, and dumping excess copper when their<br/>\nweight creeps up too much. As I usually find I&#39;m still dumping 40-60pp<br/>\nin the bank every couple of days and don&#39;t really have much I can spend<br/>\nit on anyway this really isnt much of a problem. Dispite the fact that<br/>\nyou can carry some weight over your max encumberence without it visibly<br/>\ndegrading your stats, I still try to stay below encumberance just<br/>\nbecause I find the constant messages as anthem (or now berserker&#39;s)<br/>\nwears off to be too annoying to put up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people like the Wood Elf for their easy access to bronze plate<br/>\nat lower levels (not to mention the ability to wear a Crush tunic, which<br/>\nI&#39;ve always been amazed fit an Orc three times the size of my Half Elf<br/>\nbut wouldn&#39;t fit my Half Elf) but personally I prefered the Half Elf, as<br/>\nmuch for the stats but as for not having to start in Greater Faydark<br/>\n(despite having the goofiest looking plate helm in the game - ok maybe<br/>\nwe tie with humans on that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
