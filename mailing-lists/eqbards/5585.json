I am constantly Chaining stuff that<br/>\ngets away from them.  Believe me, I would dearly love to not<br/>\nhave to deal with what they&#39;re fighting (difficult to target<br/>\nwith all those bodies around), and just buff and/or Strike the<br/>\nother mobs.  It never seems to work out that way though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Additionally, the chains act as a major taunt, which is sometimes good but<br/>\n&gt; not always. A snare is a very weak taunt. A ranger/druid can snare a mob<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I think the amount of taunt is about this same,<br/>\nexcept Chain gets cast over and over, while Snare you only<br/>\nneed to cast once.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and never have it aggro on him very easily. Additioanly, snare (NOT<br/>\n&gt; ensnare) last a guaranteed, set time varying with level. Once they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; snared, there&#39;s no chance of that mob breaking free until that set time<br/>\n&gt; has passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting.  Didn&#39;t know that - that would change strategies<br/>\nconsiderably.  Can you &quot;refresh&quot; the snare before this period<br/>\nis up by recasting it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; It&#39;s better than relying on casters to snare/root because you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can chase mobs while singing this song - they can&#39;t while<br/>\n&gt; &gt; casting snare/root.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, it&#39;s MUCH better to rely on casters to snare. Why? Because chains has<br/>\n&gt; to be cast while the runner is trying to run -- one failure and it&#39;s time<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>???  You can Chain something that&#39;s already Chained.  If we&#39;re<br/>\nin a dangerous situation and can&#39;t afford runners, I start to<br/>\nChain a couple rounds before it should begin to run.  If it&#39;s<br/>\na yellow or red mob with a high chance of resisting, I just<br/>\nkeep Chaining it over and over after that.  I&#39;ve had just two<br/>\nmobs (red) get away from me in the last month or so of doing<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to evac. Snare can be cast on all the mobs at the beginning of the battle,<br/>\n&gt; without making the mobs attack the snarer. You then no longer have to<br/>\n&gt; worry about mobs escaping. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like I said, I&#39;m constantly Chaining stuff that starts to run<br/>\nwhen the snare expires.  At that point, you can still Chain<br/>\nwhile chasing the mob.  Casters need to stand still to<br/>\nsnare/root it again.  So Chain is often the *only* option.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But a bard who chains snared mobs is likely to get kicked out of many<br/>\n&gt; groups after getting them all killed a few times.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe it changes at higher levels.  Nearly all the recent bad<br/>\nsituations I&#39;ve gotten into involving runners was when I<br/>\nrelied on a druid or ranger to snare and didn&#39;t bother<br/>\nChaining.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
