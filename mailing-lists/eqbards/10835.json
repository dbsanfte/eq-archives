They really may have taken away &quot;see invis&quot;<br/>\nfrom the lizards in there if they ever had it because getting through the<br/>\nmaze would have been extremely difficult as Sylly describes.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have heard that RADIANT in CT sees invis, maybe you ran afoul of<br/>\n&gt; him/her. She is usualy in the maze with all the others. I know that<br/>\n&gt; Defenders and Warders do not see invis, as well as all th lizzies in the<br/>\n&gt; TR (since i often invis by them all to look to see if the Tae Ew Templar<br/>\n&gt; is in).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Uldar Ulfangson<br/>\n&gt; 32nd Bard, RodcetNife<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1999 15:54:02 -0600<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: Cazic-Thule: A recommendation<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmmm, maybe it&#39;s my perfume?
