Been asking people <br/>\nbut no one seems to know. I don&#39;t want to bug someone I don&#39;t know to go <br/>\nthere to /con him, so I&#39;m stuck with the memory of a lvl 16 guy I was with <br/>\nonce saying the hermit /conned red to him.<br/>\nSpeaking of that general area, what&#39;s up with Guard McCluskey? I want to <br/>\nkill him, just cuz. Anybody done it? I think I might&#39;ve missed a crucial <br/>\nmoment the other day when I was wandering and passed through that those <br/>\nhouses near the canyon to Qeynos hills (where that Misty lady hangs out all <br/>\nday) and I saw McCluskey walking away from Misty.<br/>\nNow, whether they exchanged words or not I don&#39;t know, and it&#39;s probably <br/>\nwishful thinking on my part (The most impressive (and I say that dubiously) <br/>\ndisplay of AI I&#39;ve seen was when the Brothers near there used to flame the <br/>\ncrap out of each other once in a while) but it could be cool to find out <br/>\nmore about those folks in such a way eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tDennis Crews [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dcrews@...\">dcrews@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tThursday, May 13, 1999 6:07 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Lv30 Bard Song<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Dennis Crews &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dcrews@...\">dcrews@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought of this...<br/>\n<br/>\nPossible *SPOILER* for some:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone completed the quest from Valen Nostrolo in South Karana?
