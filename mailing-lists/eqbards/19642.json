I thought pixie strike might be to blame but I stopped using it<br/>\nand zoned and still was voted most popular among the Arachnid set. The night<br/>\nbefore it was Giants in the Frontier mountains, I was &quot;pulling&quot; everything<br/>\nif I came off the hill to the flat before the castle. Now, *there* I was<br/>\nusing both pixie strike and Song of the Sirens. Something really really<br/>\nstinky is up with bards and hate lists, it&#39;s gettiing ugly out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, 34, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
