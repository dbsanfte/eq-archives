Obviously this meant no twinking, and<br/>\neven more, as I started on the first day the server opened, no cheap<br/>\nitems easily obtainable by low level chars. Half of the people I liked<br/>\non my original server are long gone now and the other half spend all<br/>\ntheir time gathering gear for their other characters, which I found<br/>\nboring, so making new freinds on a new server has also been fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, AFAIK, if someone wants to twink, who cares? I certainly don&#39;t.<br/>\nAnd, with their obvious lack of concern for providing other things for<br/>\nhigher level people to do, obviously Verant doesn&#39;t either. In fact, I<br/>\nthink they probably hope people will stay interested in playing longer<br/>\nby gathering gear for their newbie characters. There&#39;s certainly not<br/>\nmuch else around to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
