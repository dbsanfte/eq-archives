I&#39;m a woman & I&#39;m interested in &quot;D&D&quot;<br/>\ntype games... whoa, wait a minute... my main is<br/>\nalso a warrior... I bet this guy would think this<br/>\nsays something about MY sexuality. Maybe I<br/>\nsecretly want to be a man... lol... I think<br/>\nnot!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n/snip<br/>\nIm not sure if you are referring to me or the author of the article, but I<br/>\nhave nothing against women playing eq, I&#39;m all for it, wish I could get my<br/>\nwife to play, but alas, its not gonna happen. I was just saying that I know<br/>\nmany people have had social problems due to eq, for example I know a guy<br/>\nback on sol ro that lost his job, his wife and sold his jaguar so that he<br/>\ncould play eq (moron).  Even myself sometimes the wife faction drops due to<br/>\nplaying hours, those 3-6 hours raids are painful, I only do those when she&#39;s<br/>\nworking. But I also know where to draw the line. Real life is more important<br/>\nto me then phat gear. And you being into D&D games, I envy ya, I wish my<br/>\nwife was too, but she&#39;s not much into that era/medieval stuff, she more<br/>\nhigh-fi.  If ya met someone in eq then I wish ya nothing but good times, but<br/>\nI know that many have suffered more then people who have gained.  But there<br/>\nare lotsa &quot;interesting people playing eq, and this topic has come up on the<br/>\nAyonae Ro boards. Its rather pathetic how some people act online.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and the eq boxes, they&#39;re a joke to me, i remember one time i bought one<br/>\nand brought it into the office instead of leaving it in the car, so I could<br/>\nread the manual or something during the afternoon (beats playin freecell)<br/>\nand a lady in my department made a comment something of the sort &quot;oh i bet<br/>\nyou really like that outfit blah blah blah&quot;.  It really pissed me off, i<br/>\njust looked at her and told her very sarcasticly something like  &quot;ya they<br/>\nreally get me going&quot;. Come on people, I been playin since beta 3, before<br/>\nthat it was uo.  I  play cause I like rpg stuff, not cause some dork artist<br/>\ndoest get out of the office enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheck this thread out, it pretty much sums it up...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=833.topic\">http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=833.topic</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Minkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
