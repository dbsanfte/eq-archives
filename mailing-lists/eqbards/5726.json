What I&#39;m ready to go after is<br/>\nBrahm&#39;s Horn, from the named mino 40ish or so, I&#39;m told.  I <br/>\nwould imagine a good party of 30-35s could take him out very<br/>\neasily.  Lord Grimrot is 37th, and was beaten by a 30,34,35.<br/>\nAnd Grimrot hits _hard_.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for SolA, since the weekend is here (meaning the jerks sign<br/>\non in numbers) I will be leaving CT tonight and heading out<br/>\nto somewhere else.  So SolA would be a good idea.  I cannot<br/>\nstand rubi-itis when it rears its ugly face.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my first stop is Permafrost for a white wolf cloak and<br/>\na 1h silvery war axe.  I know exactly who to kill for what, I<br/>\njust never had the group to clear and hold the throne room.<br/>\nMaybe pick up a mammoth cloak, CIMS, or runed circlet for trade.<br/>\nI could have gotten rubi legs last night had I camped the alchemist<br/>\na few more days for another cloak.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am definitely up for SolA this weekend, if it&#39;s convenient.<br/>\nThe charred BP would be nice, I just get lost in the gnome<br/>\ncastle too often.  As for the gloves... <br/>\n<br/>\ncharred gloves: ac7, +3dex, +5int<br/>\nelfhide gloves: ac4, +5dex, +5agi<br/>\n<br/>\nI can justify the loss of 3ac (and the useless int) for +2 more dex<br/>\nand +5 more agi.  Elfhide gloves are the deal.  Wish they were black.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have already obtained a pair of charred boots.  But the BP would<br/>\nbe nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 30th drummer.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
