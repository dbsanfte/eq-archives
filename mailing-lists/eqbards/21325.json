I&#39;m so tired of fighting with Verant over<br/>\nthis.  I just tested lullaby yesterday.  36% resist<br/>\nrate on a_snake, 40% resist rate an orc centurion. <br/>\nI&#39;m 41 level higher and 33 levels higher respectively.<br/>\n I just can&#39;t believe they expect us to accept this.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike most others, I doubt I will buy anything else<br/>\nfrom Verant.  Sure I&#39;ll give StarWars online a shot<br/>\nbut EQ2, no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started an Enchanter.  She&#39;s 6th now.  I have 4<br/>\nfriends dedicated to powerleveling her.  I&#39;m tired of<br/>\nfighting them so I give up.  When AO comes out, I&#39;ll<br/>\nbe one less player in EQ.  Till then, I guess I&#39;ll<br/>\nfollow the vision like a good little customer.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo those of you that stay and fight for changes to the<br/>\nbardic class, I wish you all the luck in the world. <br/>\nYou will be fighting a company that either doesn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand you or is unwilling to make changes for the<br/>\nbetter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nCentiera D&#39;Winter<br/>\n42nd Retired Half-Elf Bard<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Too bad it no longer works on mobs below 30 either. <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m sure that&#39;s now &quot;as intended&quot; as well.  What a<br/>\n&gt;load of BS.  This game has become EnchanterQuest,<br/>\n&gt;since at higher levels that&#39;s what you do.  Quest<br/>\n&gt;about looking for an Enchanter so you can fight more<br/>\n&gt;than two mobs at a time underground.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
