We hunt Arena area and King Torm area.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions for specific areas or mobs that drop more plate?  I have<br/>\nheard tell of a &quot;plate rotation&quot; but I don&#39;t know what it is or what the<br/>\nmobs are in the rotation.  But it does get called as a camp on our server<br/>\nand I&#39;ve yet to hear any info on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks ahead of time,<br/>\n<br/>\nRaub Zaumbie<br/>\n(now 56th troubador wohoo)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
