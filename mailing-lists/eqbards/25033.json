One: only put it on machines with top of the line","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1077890668\">Ok, here&#39;s what i&#39;ve found about ME working with it as a computer technician<br/>\nsince it came out...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne: only put it on machines with &#39;top of the line&#39; hardware...<br/>\nSubstandard drivers, such as come with &#39;generic&#39; hardware seem to cause all<br/>\nsorts of problems.<br/>\nIf you are using &#39;name-brand&#39; hardware, and keep drivers updated to ME<br/>\ncompatible, you won&#39;t have too many problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo: Only use &#39;name brand&#39; memory.  Yeah, I know you can go out on the web<br/>\nand buy that stick of pc-100 128 mb of ram for 1/3 of what CompUSA or<br/>\nwhoever charges, but there is a reason for that...<br/>\nIf you are gonna get new memory, don&#39;t be cheap and go ahead and get<br/>\nKingston or VisionTek or such. Yeah, it&#39;ll cost you a bit more in the short<br/>\nterm, but it&#39;ll make you alot happier in the long run.  (Compaq and HP both<br/>\nuse Kingston, or used to, even though it&#39;s labeled as Compaq or HP).<br/>\n<br/>\nThree: Nortons/McAffee/Other &#39;Suites&#39; and ME just don&#39;t get along at all...<br/>\nRun Norton AntiVirus, McAffee Antivirus, etc., but DON&#39;T run the entire<br/>\nsuites, you will cause more problems than you will solve. (Especially the<br/>\n&#39;anti-crash&#39; applications - you will blue screen more often than the<br/>\nsoftware will save you).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife&#39;s machine has been running ME since it was released, it&#39;s a Compaq<br/>\nw/ some upgraded parts (used to be my old EQ machine) and it hasn&#39;t crashed<br/>\nsince it was loaded, and it runs 24/7 for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy machine is home-built, and I&#39;ve only put in the best parts I could put my<br/>\nhands on, i.e. SB Live, Hercules GEForce, Adaptec SCSI, Maxtor HDD (40GB<br/>\nUDMA 100), and NAME BRAND MEMORY.  I crash, but that&#39;s because I have who<br/>\nknows what loaded on my system...I run every game I come across, beta&#39;s,<br/>\ndemo&#39;s, etc. etc. etc., and usually the crashes are from some of that, and<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t real common.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\n40th Bard<br/>\nSolusek Ro Blood Tide<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 13, 2001 7:26 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] OT - Equipment question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;severe snippage&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
