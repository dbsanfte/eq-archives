At<br/>\n  higher levels, mobs do WAY more damage than PC&#39;s.  A bard could easily<br/>\n  outdamage a monk or rogue with refreshable charm.  Mana would not be a real<br/>\n  issue, just sit down and med between battles.  With non refreshable charm,<br/>\n  I&#39;m convinced if Verant saw a good charming bard in action, they would nerf<br/>\n  it.  To eliminate the only real downside to charm, would be too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ll disagree on this, no biggie :)  A lot of people don&#39;t agree with me on<br/>\n  how powerful charm is.  There won&#39;t be any changing my mind now though,<br/>\n  since I can&#39;t use it anymore :(   You know if you charm a spectral curate in<br/>\n  KC, and you have people low on health, he&#39;ll probably heal them?  Try it<br/>\n  some time, will freak out your cleric...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Elfson Allegro 55 Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
