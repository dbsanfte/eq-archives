She was decked in<br/>\nfull bronze, and just bellowed (I have bronze, but only the smaller pieces.<br/>\nThis is because, of course, I don&#39;t think the pants and chest are worth it.)<br/>\nI asked her why she never used Anthem, and she told me &quot;bellow works better<br/>\nfor me.&quot;  Mmm, ok whatever.  Later, with her guildmates, we had to regroup<br/>\nsince the leader had left, and ended up individually taking on an undead.  I<br/>\nreceived the experience, of course.  Impressed the ogre, higher level than<br/>\nme with his deadly axe, that axe doing 60+ damage once when he got in two<br/>\ngreat swings.  I told him to try and stress to his bardic guildmate how much<br/>\nthat song can help, but it&#39;s like talking to a wall.  With fast weapons and<br/>\nAnthem or Whistling Warsong, I really can dish out the damage with the best<br/>\nof them, but no one seems to realize it.  In my opinion, the way she plays,<br/>\nusing just Bellow and Accelerando, she should just be a ranger or warrior.<br/>\nBeing a bard requires a completely unique play style, and some folks just<br/>\ndon&#39;t have the hang of it.  If she&#39;s going to only bellow, she should trade<br/>\nit in for a kick and bash!<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
