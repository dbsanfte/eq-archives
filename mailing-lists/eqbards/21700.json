First off, there has<br/>\nalready been a court case in California (of course, the state with the<br/>\nmost lawyers per capita) that has deemed an everquest account not to be<br/>\nproperty.  Given the tendency of most courts not to overturn previous<br/>\nrulings, accounts will most likely continue to be considered as such. <br/>\nTherefore, banning (or taking away the account) cannot be treated in most<br/>\nof the aforementioned ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only one left is the contestation that Verant&#39;s &quot;for any reason&quot;<br/>\nclause does not give them the legal right to terminate service.  This<br/>\ncould be connected, in this case, to the free speech issue.  The first<br/>\nargument, however, that she has the write to express whatever she wishes<br/>\nin a traditional public forum is moot--she can, and did.  The question<br/>\nremains as to whether Verant has the right to terminate service for such.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is little or no analogy between the first amendment and the<br/>\nfourteenth (or so-called equal protection clause) in constitutional law. <br/>\nThey are considered and reasoned differently, and have very different<br/>\nmethods of application.  The first amendment can only very rarely be<br/>\napplied to private entities, and only in very specific ways.  Extending<br/>\nthe first amendment to a right of service is even more tenuous.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the rights of service connection may even be less grounded than<br/>\nthe extension of the EULA and Rules of Conduct.  The supposed post, even<br/>\nif not the correct post, would likely have violated the rules of conduct<br/>\nin several ways, had it been expressed in any part on a Verant, Sony, or<br/>\n989 affiliated mode of communication.   Furthermore, there is no<br/>\nlimitation within the snowball.com terms of service that they cannot<br/>\nprovide content to affiliated entities (i.e. Verant).  Once the material<br/>\nhas been given to Verant, Snowball&#39;s liability clause authorizes other<br/>\nentities (Verant) to do commence actions which may prevent Snowball from<br/>\nbeing prosecuted for said liabilty.  Now, this is not exactly my interest<br/>\nin law--really, I know next to nothing about liabilty law--but the<br/>\nactions I see can all fit into this framework, with a little bit of legal<br/>\nfanangling.  I&#39;m certainly not saying this is right (heck, if Verant saw<br/>\nsome of my private stories, they could possibly ban me, who knows?), but<br/>\nit may be more legally sound than it looks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last tidbit for the faithful...it has been quoted to me that there is<br/>\na legal representative on the council that makes banning decisions. <br/>\nYou&#39;d think even a Verant lawyer would know enough about covering one&#39;s<br/>\nass to not have made a huge mistake here.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Karisma<br/>\n(site address withheld for the safety of the innocent ;P)<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
