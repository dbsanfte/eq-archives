Heroes don&#39;t bleed to<br/>\ndeath after being shot by an arrow from soem schlep goblin.  We ran into a<br/>\nsome hige warlord, mega evil NPC.  Whats our plan to kill him?  Launch a<br/>\nsmall army of distempered  lizards into the castle, one of them will<br/>\ncritical him and kill him...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I played Gemstone which was based on Rolemaster, its was a fun<br/>\nMudd, so the system has merit when you have a computer to crunch the<br/>\nnumbers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
