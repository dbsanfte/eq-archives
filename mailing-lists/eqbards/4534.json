I also play an enchanter, and at only 8th level, he <br/>\n&gt;already had problems deciding on what to memorize - and now having just <br/>\n&gt;gotten 12th (but none of the spells - too poor), he&#39;s gonna be hard-pressed <br/>\n&gt;to make his decision.  As it is, he&#39;s already juggling spell slots (3 <br/>\n&gt;buffs, 2 slots), and he can never decide whether invisibility or gate is <br/>\n&gt;more important.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n     <br/>\nTransfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500! <br/>\nFor program details, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n     <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
