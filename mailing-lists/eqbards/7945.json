What the heck is up with that anyhow?  Maybe I&#39;m awfully<br/>\nold-fashioned for my age, but gads why do some men, no scratch that, boys in<br/>\nthis game think its socially acceptable under any circumstances to send<br/>\nevery female in the game a /tell commenting on their cleavage and can they<br/>\nshow more?  I&#39;ve seen a couple reasonable rp&#39;ing events of this sort that<br/>\nwere pretty funny, like the female bard in Freeport offering &quot;entertainment&quot;<br/>\nfor pay, singing optional.  On the whole though there is a frightening<br/>\ndichotomy between the gentlemanly, &quot;Yes, I&#39;d love to help you, btw do you<br/>\nneed a rubicite helm?&quot; to the ridicuous pre-teen comments I have seen on my<br/>\nfriends screen.  She gets some of the most insulting and lewd /tells I have<br/>\never seen.  Her /ignore list now numbers at somewhere over 100 people as a<br/>\nresult.  Of course her /friends list is also about 3 times as long as mine.<br/>\nJust goes to show I guess, eerything has a price.  Must be Veran&#39;t idea of<br/>\nbalancing the sex not to make such things a bannable offense.<br/>\n <br/>\n        Kitasi the polite<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 4:43 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Umm Twinking Still<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLOL.  I personally would wear them, you earned them :-)  And yes,<br/>\nwomen do get very preferential treatment I think.  I have stayed out of the<br/>\nwhole binding argument because I have never had a problem getting bound.<br/>\nEver.  Because my character is female, all I&#39;ve ever had to do is walk up to<br/>\na group and ask &quot;will one of you please bind me.&quot;  My warrior friend can<br/>\nshout for HOURS and have no response.  I&#39;ve also been given numerous items<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m &quot;cute.&quot;  Is this fair?  No. But then again, men don&#39;t have to<br/>\nput up with tells from strangers who want to know if they like to be spanked<br/>\n:P<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTani, 15th Bard <br/>\nHalana, 30th Shaman <br/>\nSolusek Ro <br/>\n<br/>\n\tBM__MailData-----Original Message----- <br/>\nFrom:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a> [ mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a><br/>\n&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a>&gt; ] <br/>\nSent:   Tuesday, October 05, 1999 4:34 PM <br/>\nTo:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\nSubject:        [eqbards] Umm Twinking Still <br/>\n<br/>\n\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n\tI will probably regret sending this mail .. Please remember this is<br/>\nmy first mail list and I have only been playing EQ for about 2 months now,<br/>\nso many of these comcepts are still new to me (Twinking, Item Camping,<br/>\nfarming ??). I have read the Glossary so I understand the meaning if not the<br/>\nconcept.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLast night I was hunting in Crushbone and was grouped with a very<br/>\nhigh level player, I did not understand the EXP share problem. He just asked<br/>\nme to keep singing my heal song and he would look after me, I grouped with<br/>\nhim for several hours and didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about<br/>\nthis he said he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told him<br/>\nI needed exp and would move on, at that point he said he had some stuff for<br/>\nme and initiated a trade. I asked my friend via tell if I should accept and<br/>\nhe said yes as I earnt it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate<br/>\nand a pair of Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good (I<br/>\ncould see via AC and Stats they were, but how good?) he said they were, too<br/>\ngood for my level. I have banked them for now and wanted to ask the list if<br/>\nI should wear them/sell them or give them away. I have no problem with<br/>\ntwinking but dont want to be called a cheat. So please no flames just an<br/>\nopinion on what I should!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t do. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tOh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ? <br/>\n<br/>\n\tRegards <br/>\nNina <br/>\n<br/>\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>\nGet your free email from AltaVista at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://altavista.iname.com\">http://altavista.iname.com</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://altavista.iname.com\">http://altavista.iname.com</a>&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n---------------------------- <br/>\n<br/>\n\tDoes Windows keep &quot;&quot;bugging&quot;&quot; you?
