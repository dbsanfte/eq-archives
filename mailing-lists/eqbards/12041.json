You see, I was fairly certain that<br/>\nthe quest giver used to say, Remember to ask me later about &quot;a special<br/>\nbardic weapon.&quot;  However, now he says, Remember to ask me later about &quot;a<br/>\nSPECIFIC bardic weapon.&quot;  I think the fact that he says specific is<br/>\ncertainly a strong indicator that this quest starts elsewhere in the world.<br/>\nWe&#39;re going to have to follow clues to get the name of this weapon, at which<br/>\npoint we ask him about it and he gives us the quest to get it.  Sounds great<br/>\nto me!  Anyone up for a search?  Anyone think I&#39;m loony and the quest just<br/>\nisn&#39;t in the game yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nLaena -- Bard, 29 E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
