I have never seen any seemingly believable forumla for the monster&#39;s xp<br/>\nvalue, I believe its a combination of many factors including a zone<br/>\nmultiplier and a small linear increase based on how many people are in the<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  This formula would mean that race classes with high xp values are not so<br/>\nmuch punished as are the people who they group with.  If this is the case<br/>\n(which most people believe it is, and I all I have ever seen Verant say is,<br/>\n&quot;Our xp system is not going to change.&quot;) then its one of the worst examples<br/>\nof programming I have ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor perspective on it, a lvl 50 human warrior has about the same xp as a 42<br/>\ntroll shadowknight.  Your killer group (lets say enchanter, cleric, shaman,<br/>\nbard, rogue) needs a heavy tank.  Which is going to bring more to your<br/>\ngroup?  Since both are going to take the same share of xp, of course you<br/>\nshould take the 50 warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think classes are pretty well balanced in the game.  I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand why they take differenet amounts of xp.  As for races, I<br/>\nwould have rather seen the races better balanced, eliminating the need for<br/>\nxp differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  If you are too far below the higest level person in the group (I believe<br/>\nif you con green to them) you will get no xp.  Verant has stated if you get<br/>\nxp, you get a full share.  Assumign this is true, then youe only penalty you<br/>\nare paying is the total xp ratio difference...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
