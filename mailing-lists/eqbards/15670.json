For<br/>\nmost folks, that varies from playsession to playsession, so<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have to adapt to it each time.  You may have to stick<br/>\nin a short pause before starting charm, but the pause will<br/>\nusually be consistent over the time you&#39;re charming a single<br/>\nmob.  When my ping times drop below 150 ms, I can consistently<br/>\nget in 3 songs before having to recharm (equivalent to weaving<br/>\n4 songs).  Lately it&#39;s been up around 180ms, and trying to get<br/>\n3 songs in gives the mobs too much time to reach me.  So I<br/>\njust pause a bit before the charm (one... two... charm).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust be aware that because the server runs on a 6 second<br/>\nheartbeat (I&#39;m pretty sure), the timing for the first charm<br/>\nwill probably be different from subsequent charms.  Also, if<br/>\ncharm is resisted or the mob breaks out early, the timing for<br/>\nthat charm cycle will be off again.  Once you get a rhythm<br/>\ngoing, it&#39;s pretty consistent though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose you could set up a metronome next to your computer<br/>\nto figure the timing more precisely.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
