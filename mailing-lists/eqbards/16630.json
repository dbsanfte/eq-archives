When I was in my<br/>\nteens, giants almost always hit for 100+.  Now that they&#39;re<br/>\ngreen to me, they miss a lot and seem to average around 30-40<br/>\nper hit.  Hymn + Niv&#39;s IMHO is about right for the L47-50<br/>\nrange.  A tad underpowered when solo, a tad overpowered when<br/>\ngrouped with 5-6.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 18. Group damage dispersion/distribution: very interesting, I like the fact<br/>\n&gt; that it is a double edged sword. It will help spread the damage out, however<br/>\n&gt; if someone is close to dying, then this could concievably kill them. serious<br/>\n&gt; invsetigation would need to take place regarding PvP aviodance.

Last<br/>\nnight we had two bats several times.  I tried both Pixie<br/>\nStriking one, or helping the others fight while letting the<br/>\nsecond bat beat on me.  Basically there was no difference.  <br/>\nThe resist rate is so bad that my crowd control ability is as<br/>\neffective as my damage infliction capability.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
