Just like the missing songs a few months ago were left for<br/>\nfuture expansion?

I checked our vendor in FV and no new songs.  I suppose I&#39;m not<br/>\nbeing literal enough; I&#39;d be nuts to confuse songs with &#39;spells&#39;, right? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-KS<br/>\n<br/>\n(less than a bub away from being a Scary Bard)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
