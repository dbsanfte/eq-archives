One of the common ones that everyone knows about is the<br/>\n&gt;interrelation of hitpoints and level with the attacker. One of the other<br/>\n&gt;less-known components was using some uninitialized memory (memory space<br/>\n&gt;allocated to a variable that hasn&#39;t yet been &#39;set&#39; to anything, and usually<br/>\n&gt;contains garbage) that had the effect of making NPCs much more brave than<br/>\n&gt;they should have been.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We are going to discuss this in the tuning meeting Monday, but my initial<br/>\n&gt;impression is that the AI is now working as it should, and I like how things<br/>\n&gt;are turning out so far.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What are your thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Gordon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
