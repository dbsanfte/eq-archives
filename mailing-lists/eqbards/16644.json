One of the big<br/>\ncomplaints about UO (from a designer&#39;s standpoint) was<br/>\npeople recalling from the bank to the hunting grounds,<br/>\nfighting until full of loot, recalling to the bank,<br/>\nselling and dropping stuff off, then recalling bank. <br/>\nWhile it was convenient, it destroyed most of the<br/>\nimmersion factor of the game by eliminating the<br/>\ntravel component.
