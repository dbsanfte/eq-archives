You cant make money if you are so bz power levvving.  You<br/>\nneed to travel around and spend all your time in tells.  Fiting mobs really<br/>\nslows down the money making and deal doing.  Once you get a decent amount of<br/>\ncapital and make some fiends with players who let you sell their stuffs and<br/>\nif you like doing it - you can really roll thru the plats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have sold easily over 2000pp worth of stuffs in the past 2 weeks.  The<br/>\nFBR&#39;s and Golden Black pearl Chokers go for lotsa plat.  The 200pp stuffs<br/>\nare mid levels.
