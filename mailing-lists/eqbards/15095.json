Otherwise you will find the pet users in your group will be<br/>\nmightly PO&#39;d with you when you try to give them see invis.  Also the 24th<br/>\nlvl song grants Ultravision, which is a big help to our night-blind human<br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI Very few, if ANY of our songs are useless.  Some are just more<br/>\nspecialized then others.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGet what you deserve with NextCard Visa.
