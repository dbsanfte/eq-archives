It&#39;s one thing that annoys me about being a<br/>\nbard, other than dieing all the time but these 2 factors are linked.<br/>\nDon&#39;t know if you have these books in America (I am from England), but when<br/>\nI was younger I used to love reading the Asterix books, and the bard in<br/>\nthose stories was portrayed as a dreadful singer and a clumsy fool. Gives<br/>\nme a chuckle as I think Verant based the bard class around that character.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 42 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\nPs, I noticed whilst in my local bard guild that the new skills (parry and<br/>\nriposte) were there to be trained in. I do however wish bards got an extra<br/>\nattack skill for after level 50. We are so poor at fighting, Verant could<br/>\nat least give us double attack after 50 levels of suffering without it.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not like we are gonna be able to solo stuff at that level so why would<br/>\nit hurt? It would simply make us deal a little extra damage therefore<br/>\nmaking us more appealing to groups (only problem would be the extra taunt<br/>\nfrom the addittional dmg).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBill Costlow &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>&gt; on 27/03/2000 13:49:39<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\ncc:    (bcc: John Senior/M&G)<br/>\nSubject:  Re: [eqbards] Digest Number 839<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Bill Costlow &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Renee Cole &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nat_ive@...\">nat_ive@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It was so bad I got to the point I never<br/>\n&gt; played any songs in GF or<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d draw  a huge crowd of booing mobs all armed with<br/>\n&gt; rotting vegetables.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL!
