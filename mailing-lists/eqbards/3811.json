I do have one thing to<br/>\n&gt; say about your last line though:  people that pay real money for online<br/>\n&gt; stuff have 2 things and missing one thing.  1) Alot of money, 2) Alot of<br/>\n&gt; time, and the thing they are missing is sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the way I felt at first.  But talking with my friends<br/>\nand watching it play out in UO (and now EQ) over the last<br/>\nseveral months has really been an eye-opener for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me try to draw an analogy.  Baseball cards.  They&#39;re just<br/>\npieces of cardboard with ink printed on them.  But many many<br/>\npeople enjoy collecting them, enough so that they will pay<br/>\nmuch more for a rare one than you and I probably make in a<br/>\nyear.  Their enthusiasm for it drives up the real life value<br/>\nof these pieces of paper to the point where some of them trade<br/>\nthese things as their full-time job, and get paid or make<br/>\nreal-life money for doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same thing is happening with the items in UO and EQ (less<br/>\nso in EQ since there are no sinks).  Yes they&#39;re nothing more<br/>\nthan electronic bits on a computer somewhere, but just like<br/>\nwith baseball cards, they have real-life value.  And just like<br/>\nbaseball cards (and stamps and art and all sorts of other<br/>\nthings with no real practical value), they are being<br/>\nintegrated into real-life society and economy.  If you don&#39;t<br/>\nyet see this, 5 years from now you&#39;ll be wondering how you<br/>\nmissed this boat; just like the folks who threw away their<br/>\nbaseball card collection and Roger Maris rookie card when they<br/>\n&quot;outgrew&quot; the hobby.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it seems silly that people will pay real life money for<br/>\nvirtual stuff, but that&#39;s the way it&#39;s going to be from now<br/>\non, our concept of a MMORPG notwithstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n(If you really want something to ponder, most real-life money<br/>\nnowadays is nothing more than electronic bits on bank<br/>\ncomputers.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
