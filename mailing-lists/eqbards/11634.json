Bet you made a friend for life with that tip.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would imagine that a lot of people have sold lambent stones to the gypsies<br/>\nin NK.  Nice to know that if I&#39;m having trouble finding a giant hunting<br/>\nparty or someone selling a stone I can always try this option.  Hard part<br/>\nthen would be picking the right gypsy:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; it shows the older items.  my friend accidentally sold his mortificator<br/>\n&gt; staff to an npc.  this is the only one we know of on our server, he got it<br/>\n&gt; in a GM event.  i did not hear until about a week later, and he was still<br/>\n&gt; upset about it.  i told him i heard if you go buy all of the items from<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; list it will eventually pop up.  and it worked, he got the staff back, but<br/>\n&gt; he had to buy a bunch of stuff for it to show up.  AND he even killed the<br/>\n&gt; vendor after he sold it, but when he repopped he still had the staff<br/>\n&gt; buried<br/>\n&gt; beneath all the junk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt; Tyria Sarkin, L31 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Manda D&#39;ulin, L22 Wood Elf Warrior<br/>\n&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
