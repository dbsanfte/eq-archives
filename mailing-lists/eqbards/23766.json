I can take the hits after <br/>\n&gt;mez is broken, I&#39;d like the Shaman to stay medding. Of course, if the <br/>\n&gt;Bard is mezzing and the Enchanter is Slowing rather than a Shaman, <br/>\n&gt;then the Chanter will still be beat on.  I think it&#39;s easier to let <br/>\n&gt;the Enchanter mez, so he can properly prep the mob for the break if <br/>\n&gt;need be.  (mem blur)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;hmm, speaking of memblur, i wonder what would happen if i threw a charm<br/>\n&gt;on it after the malo and slow but long before the mez broke.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do this all the time.  Its a perfect way to taunt the mob onto you and not have to wait for the chanter to mem blur.  Darn chanters always take too long to cast, I get impatient.  One thing I&#39;ve found though: Just charming and waiting for charm to break isn&#39;t sufficient to taunt it onto you.  You need to /pet back off or the mob will still be aggro on whoever slowed/mezzed/debuffed it.  This is one of the few times when Rallos bards have the advantage over the rest of you - I can charm, hit /pet back off, and immediately attack my pet.  I then get to tank for about 2-3 seconds until my friendly fattietank (tm) taunts it off me.  Nice not having to wait 12 secs for charm to break on its own. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lohengrin, 60th Virtuoso, Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
