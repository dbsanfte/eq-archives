The only thing that might be called a bug<br/>\nabout<br/>\nit, is if you are already fighting the same monster and you hit your assist<br/>\nhotkey<br/>\nagain, you may end up targetting the player you meant to assist, but then,<br/>\nthat<br/>\nwould really be an operator error anyway (since you would be assisting the<br/>\nmob that<br/>\nis fighting the player in your party, assist is actually working as it<br/>\nshould).  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think Assist is buggy.  Probably people are using it wrong.  If you<br/>\nhave a<br/>\nmain tank that is usually in your party, you can make a hotkey just for that<br/>\ncharacter (/assist tank).  That saves time targeting them and reduces the<br/>\nliklihood<br/>\nof errors.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The people in my party use /assist all the time, and we&#39;ve found it to be<br/>\n </span></blockquote>very<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; very buggy.
