Also, note that the points assigned to mobs maybe updated<br/>\n&gt; somewhere internally (ie they have more mobs listed where <br/>\n&gt; else - I read that<br/>\n&gt; when someone from AL was telling someone else to go there and <br/>\n&gt; read it.)  But<br/>\n&gt; in general you will see how it works for them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I first saw their system - I was a bit taken aback.  But <br/>\n&gt; after being in<br/>\n&gt; a large guild with a totally different system, I can really <br/>\n&gt; see some good<br/>\n&gt; value in how they do it.  Our guild&#39;s policy is that loot <br/>\n&gt; should go to those<br/>\n&gt; who both need it in that they dont have a better item and <br/>\n&gt; those who have<br/>\n&gt; been trying to get it for the longest time.  Well, that turns <br/>\n&gt; into &quot;the<br/>\n&gt; oldest guild memebers in the class get all the best things first.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Essentially, everyone goes on most all of our raids and we do <br/>\n&gt; not keep and<br/>\n&gt; accurate attendance record. So, you have everyone saying: &quot;I <br/>\n&gt; have been on<br/>\n&gt; every POH/POF/POS, Naggy, Vox, VS, DS, Trak, etc etc since I <br/>\n&gt; joined the<br/>\n&gt; guild...&quot;  Also, our policy is that primary characters get loot before<br/>\n&gt; secondarys.  Well, that becomes problematic when one gets <br/>\n&gt; asked to play the<br/>\n&gt; secondary because that is what this raid &quot;needs.&quot; So without <br/>\n&gt; some point<br/>\n&gt; system, who earns credit?  What happens if its your primary&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; turn to loot<br/>\n&gt; an item and they are not active in the raid? Say you have 3 <br/>\n&gt; bards and one is<br/>\n&gt; asked to play a cleric for VS raid.  Bard greaves drop. Do <br/>\n&gt; you uncamp the<br/>\n&gt; primary to loot and item when 2 others of that class were <br/>\n&gt; fighting in the<br/>\n&gt; raid?  Point systems can address these issues ahead of time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other thing to look at - for those of you who are <br/>\n&gt; interested in &#39;what<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s like to be uber&#39; is the minimum equipment requirements <br/>\n&gt; to join AL.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Here&#39;s a list of boring greenies we are not gonna camp for <br/>\n&gt; you...&quot;  But<br/>\n&gt; indeed it is a list that says you are well equipped and ready <br/>\n&gt; for a variety<br/>\n&gt; situations.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the other &#39;uber&#39; guilds on our server has a loot <br/>\n&gt; policy that says<br/>\n&gt; loot goes to the oldest and highest level players first.  <br/>\n&gt; Their focus is on<br/>\n&gt; level and they leveled as many as possible to 60 as soon as <br/>\n&gt; possible.  That<br/>\n&gt; did put them in good shpe to be doing Trak first and VS and <br/>\n&gt; they have been<br/>\n&gt; first ones in our server to go to VP.  Their focus is <br/>\n&gt; different - to them<br/>\n&gt; level is the number one thing.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 20, 2000 9:24 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Stuff!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So you guys use a point system?  I seem to remember talking <br/>\n&gt; about this in a<br/>\n&gt; thread a while back.  We have discussed using points on and off but it<br/>\n&gt; always comes down to the fear that they won&#39;t be assigned <br/>\n&gt; uniformly and also<br/>\n&gt; that nobody would want the responsibility of maintaining such <br/>\n&gt; a thing.   We<br/>\n&gt; use more of a deferment system.. aka peer pressure.. which <br/>\n&gt; seems to work<br/>\n&gt; most of the time, though.  Do you like the point system? Can <br/>\n&gt; you use point<br/>\n&gt; for any item you want or does it have to be an item that is <br/>\n&gt; &quot;clearly&quot; for<br/>\n&gt; your class?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; eLerts<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s Easy.
