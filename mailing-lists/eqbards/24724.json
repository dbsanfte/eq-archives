I SUCK at charming,<br/>\nfind it annoying and frankly not worth the time and effort (or the healers<br/>\nmana).  But messing seems to work fine, can keep 2 things off pretty<br/>\nreliably and still manage to sing haste.  However if I&#39;m in an area where<br/>\nI&#39;m getting high resists I usually just suck it up, sing haste, regen and<br/>\nnivs and try to mitigate damage.  But thats just me, maybe I need to learn<br/>\nthe right way to charm.<br/>\n<br/>\nTani, 51st Bard<br/>\nHalana, 60th Shammy<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Grady [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john_grady@...\">john_grady@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 14, 2001 2:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Charm Change<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree but that it doesn&#39;t ruin charm kiting, just makes it more<br/>\n&gt; difficult. I hate reaching over to the F8 key in between <br/>\n&gt; selo, restoration<br/>\n&gt; and re-targeting pet. Just one more finger stretching operation. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would be tempted to mez more but I fail too often at 105 <br/>\n&gt; CHA and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to lose the AC to get it to &gt; 125. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone tried singing the CHA song before mez? I wondering if that<br/>\n&gt; would help get mez to stick without switching gear in between <br/>\n&gt; chanters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tzeetch<br/>\n&gt; --- Windleaf Mistsong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:windleaf@...\">windleaf@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW, I tested charm kiting some frost giants (in velious) and didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really have much of a problem at all.
