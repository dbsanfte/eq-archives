I always wondered why until a couple months ago when it just hit<br/>\nme.  I kept getting these groups where people would say, &quot;Wow, your songs<br/>\nare great.  I never grouped with a bard before.&quot;  I&#39;m not talking one group<br/>\na week but several.  I usually have to laugh at it . . . level 30+ and<br/>\nnever been with a bard?  I guess most people just never played with bards,<br/>\nthey would rather just have a healer/nuker/tank, not something in between.<br/>\nI even did a &quot;/who all bard 40 60&quot; last night on The Rathe for $hits and<br/>\ngiggles 2200 people . . . 15 players found.  It is a shame there are not<br/>\nmany of us out there.  I don&#39;t remember the 30-40 number but it was around<br/>\n12-15 people.
