However, I stopped after a bit and turned around to<br/>\nnotice it was still chasing me so I made an executive decision: &quot;mess with<br/>\nthe bard, die like the rest. Ok big boy, follow me then...&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI took the SG to the Innothule zone area of sRo and made sure no newbies<br/>\nwere around and then started to chain/fear him.  I was amazed at the fact<br/>\nthat the SG stopped running at half health and even though it took me about<br/>\n5 minutes and a bar and a half of stamina (I stopped attacking at zero STA<br/>\nand rested until back up to half) that I was able to solo him.  He only<br/>\nresisted 2 fears out of five minutes worth of twisting and only got in 2<br/>\nsmacks on me the whole time.  He just stood there and grumbled as I beat the<br/>\nliving crap out of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this was amazing to me because I had never solo&#39;d a giant before and<br/>\nI generally DON&#39;T solo as a rule.  Heck he even had a lambent stone and 31pp<br/>\nto reward me for my right of passage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoral of the story:<br/>\nDon&#39;t mess with a bard!  We&#39;re nice enough folks but if you tick us off<br/>\nyou&#39;re going down baby :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 03, 2000 1:54 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Stun/root<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 3 Mar 2000, Papa Legba wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; char is pretty amazing).  Our groups biggest problem is no <br/>\n&gt; snare (we are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior/bard/cleric/wizard), but chains aren;&#39;t too far away for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bard.  (We also have a friend training up a necro who will <br/>\n&gt; give us the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; darkness spells)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my experience, the darkness line is inferior to snare.  <br/>\n&gt; Stuff with darkness on it will start to run *before* the<br/>\n&gt; darkness will halt their movement.  So they&#39;ll still manage to<br/>\n&gt; flee a bit depending on how quickly you&#39;re damaging it.  <br/>\n&gt; Early on Chain acts pretty much like snare.  But later (level<br/>\n&gt; thirty-something?) it will stop runners when they&#39;re at half<br/>\n&gt; hp.  That makes it superior to snare for stopping green<br/>\n&gt; runners, since greenies tend to run when they drop below half.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
