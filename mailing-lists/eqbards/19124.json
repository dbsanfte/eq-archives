Not certain if that is classified as an enormous quantity","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2096771909\">My guild has four bards over 40,  myself still plugging along at 36, and a<br/>\ncouple in their 20s.  Not certain if that is classified as an &quot;enormous&quot;<br/>\nquantity but we do have more bards in the guild than any other class.  One<br/>\nof the good things about having a lot of bards in your guild is that there<br/>\nis a good chance there will always be at least two bards in your group.<br/>\nGood example of what you can do with two bards occured last night in The<br/>\nOverthere.  Me and another bard guildmate were partnered up and ripping thru<br/>\neverything in the zone.  He would sing chains and fear non stop and I would<br/>\nweave celerity, chant of battle and FCC.  If a mob got more than two or<br/>\nthree attacks on us the entire combat they got lucky.  Later on a rogue saw<br/>\nus and asked what we were doing.  We explained the chains/fear trick to him.<br/>\nHe asked to join and all me and the other bard could see were visions of<br/>\nmassive backstabs in the immediate future.  After the rogue joined we were<br/>\nshredding thru mobs like a cuisinart.  The only time we ever lost a visible<br/>\nportion on our health bar was if a 2d or 3d mob aggroed on us.  At no time<br/>\ndid we ever get into serious trouble.  All in all it was non-stop killing<br/>\nwith almost zero downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing is after he had been with us for a while, the rogue mentioned<br/>\nthat he had never seen any bard fighting in the style we had.  The rogue had<br/>\na 50+ primary character so he had been playing EQ for a while.  I had though<br/>\nthe chains/fear trick was a bard standard, especially in Kunark with the<br/>\nsmall aggro radius of most mobs.  Does everyone else use this trick whenever<br/>\nthe situation supports it (i.e. outdoors) or is it a largely non-used trick?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen in Frontier Mountains lately hacking away at big giants. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, Galtin&#39;s guild Disciples of Honor has an enormous number<br/>\nof bards in it.  I think we have only three, me at 29 still, Rylos at 25,<br/>\nand a very young bard<br/>\nwhose name escapes me right now.  We are working on organizing an alliance<br/>\nwith DoH to do those tougher things later on like Dragons etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m on E&#39;ci playing around in the Lake of Ill Omen also, which guild are you<br/>\nwith?<br/>\n <br/>\nGilgurth<br/>\nBard of 24 Winces<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWas the salesman clueless?
