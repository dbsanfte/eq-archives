You ARE awfully cute.  :)  I&#39;ll have to try that with my favorite complaining Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nWent to Hate last night.  Innoruuk was down because a GM depopped him two nights previous due to some<br/>\nguild petitioning.  What they said to convince him to do that, I don&#39;t know.  Without Inny up, we cleared<br/>\nin 6.5 hours, including Maestro.  I only died once, in a mass death caused, I believe, by a late party<br/>\narriving and being too dumb to just bite the bullet in the SW corner.  I&#39;m not sure though, since I sank<br/>\nlike a lead balloon.  I only recall dying more quickly on one other occasion (four MOBs hitting me<br/>\nsimultaneously in Sebilis).  I actually had time to type &quot;where&#39;s the damn mez?&quot; and hit &lt;enter&gt; before I<br/>\ncroaked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to all for the anti-poison suggestion to deal with Maestro&#39;s AE Lifetap.  I believe I saw him try<br/>\nto cast it three times (green effects on all the close-range tanks), and my party&#39;s three tanks took just<br/>\nabout no damage from any of them.  We crushed him, no deaths.  Since the only other Bard up there has been<br/>\nup about 50 times (I don&#39;t think I&#39;m exaggerating), she has everything that Hate has to offer, so all Bard<br/>\ndrops were mine.  Of course, my guild had to jinx it by saying that Maestro always drops at least two<br/>\nthings.  Only one this time, but it was Kelin&#39;s Lute!  Also got an Imbrued Bracer, which I will proudly<br/>\nwear,  even though the Lambent is better. Sigh.  A better night than the last three trips I&#39;ve made there<br/>\nput together, where a total of one Bard item dropped, and we got slaughtered by Maestro four times.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, a tiny little, barely noticeable smidgen from 52 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Is the Sarnak Fort good for level 24s?  I want to find someplace in Lake of Ill Omen where my Warrior<br/>\ncan sit for a few levels.

My group started to yell for me to log so I did.<br/>\n&gt; Me alone.  And guess what happened?  The mobs still came and they started to<br/>\n&gt; beat on the cleric instead.  *LOL* He screams like a girl - ON ME ON ME.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever going to ask me to log again...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jacana Mourningsong<br/>\n&gt; Wood Elf of the 29th song (Woohoo level last night)<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Crimson Dragons&gt; Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
