I know at the higher levels, list<br/>\n&gt;wait times stretch much longer than the hour or two<br/>\n&gt;that you are playing, but atleast you can hop in and<br/>\n&gt;say hi. Maybe help acouple of people out ect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If nothing else, please keep your web site updated. I<br/>\n&gt;check your site ever day and find the information<br/>\n&gt;invaulable. I wish you the best and please do not be a<br/>\n&gt;stranger.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Sing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    First of all, I&#39;m still around, I read you all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everyday. =D<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I haven&#39;t played Everquest in about 2 weeks now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I may not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   play Everquest again.  In short, the game was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking away time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I needed to spend working and most importantly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking care of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   my girlfriend.  For almost 14 months (since beta<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3) she has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   endured 6-8 hour sessions of EQ on a daily<br/>\n&gt; &gt; basis.  Clearly,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   the game came before she did in all cases.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Everquest wasn&#39;t that great either, I know I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; complained about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   it often, but I&#39;d keep coming back for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people when I could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   have turned and looked 5 feet beside me and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spent time with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   that one person who counted.  Everquest/Verant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are full of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   shortcomings and I kept hoping that things would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; finally get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &#39;fixed&#39; or &#39;work properly&#39; - but that was just a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dream.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I want to play again, just not now.  Things are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going very well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   right now and I don&#39;t want to bring back the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; frustration that EQ<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   caused me.  I&#39;ll read the posts here where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; relevant, but I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   post much.  I&#39;ve got big work projects demanding<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more and more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   time.  I&#39;ve also got a kitten and a beautiful<br/>\n&gt; &gt; girlfriend demanding<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   more time as well.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; return and play the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   length of time I once played.  But I hope to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; return soon, maybe in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   a few more weeks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;__________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
