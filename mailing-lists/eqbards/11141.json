Above level 40 you will get no<br/>\nfurther bonuses to your ac as a result of defense (max 200), so to help<br/>\ndeflect damage your only hope is a miss. the 125 Dodge Bards get will<br/>\nnot be much help. Against monsters in PoH the other night I left my log<br/>\non, then reviewed how I faired with EQ Char Info. With 160 agi (verses<br/>\nwas playing, no other agi buffs) I was hit 50% of the time and missed<br/>\n50% of the time. A 50% miss rate is exceptional when all of the monsters<br/>\nare L49-52. I don&#39;t wear either breastplate, but if I were to chose, it<br/>\nwould be the Mithril hands down.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also worth noting charisma affects resistance on more than just<br/>\ncharm, many songs have their resist rate based on CHA, just like a<br/>\nshaman&#39;s debuff attacks (such as Disempower and Malise series).<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause a Mithril Breastplate isn&#39;t easy to obtain, the Lambent quest is<br/>\na great alternative. Another good option is a Brigadine Tunic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;   You could really argue most of the lambent armor is so-so,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   the mithbp with it&#39;s agi boost, gives you equal if not better<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ac than the lambentbp.  And azure sleeves have more ac than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   the lambent arms, minus the minor saves and cha.  I personally<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   wear all lambent to look good.  I will use the non-visible spots<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   to tweak my stats to where I&#39;d like them to be.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have to disagree on the Lambent BP vs Mithril BP. I get more AC and more<br/>\n&gt; HP from the Lambent BP.  My Agl is 100 btw (without the MBP). </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
