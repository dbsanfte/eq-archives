(As a matter of fact, does anyone know which creatures in<br/>\nthe game can innately see invisible?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe strange behavior with the invis song is that if any member of the party<br/>\ndoes ANYTHING to drop their invis like cast a spell, or are in Auto Attack<br/>\nmode (whether actually attacking or not) and another mob targets them, then<br/>\nthat mob will see everyone else in the party regardless of whether they<br/>\nappear to be invisible or not.  One member of your group on a monster&#39;s shit<br/>\nlist adds everyone in your group to that monster&#39;s shit list.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery tick of the invis song causes a skill check to be made and every now<br/>\nand then a character will fail, and turn visible for a single tick, until<br/>\nthe next tick of the song and then they pop invisible again.  While this is<br/>\nuncommon, it does happen, and during that tick of visibility, if you are<br/>\nnear enough to a mob to be noticed and targeted, invis is shot for the whole<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to fall under the group hate thing...where a bard singing Hymn is<br/>\n&quot;helping&quot; the members of his party (like the puller for example) so the mob<br/>\ntargets the bard - just like when a cleric heals another group member it<br/>\noften attracts the monster&#39;s attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut all alone with the mino horn and a skill of 105 in wind I sang Clouding<br/>\nand wandered all over the first 3 floors of the Unrest mansion invisible,<br/>\nchecking it all out...at one point the 2 hags from the basement walked RIGHT<br/>\npast me through the hall and just about made my heart jump out my throat,<br/>\nbut did not see me at all.  This is a fun song to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 2:40 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Bards in Unrest <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A similar thing happened to me twice when I was camping <br/>\n&gt; behind the back<br/>\n&gt; porch.  One time, my group was resting after a fight.  I had <br/>\n&gt; been using<br/>\n&gt; Denon&#39;s Discord during the previous fight.  While everyone is <br/>\n&gt; resting, the<br/>\n&gt; back door opens up and a festering hag makes a beeline <br/>\n&gt; towards me.  Next<br/>\n&gt; thing I know she zaps me for 300+ hit points and I&#39;m dead.  <br/>\n&gt; If there is a<br/>\n&gt; bug with the  axis whatever is it something that Verant is <br/>\n&gt; aware of and is<br/>\n&gt; working on fixing?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snipped from earlier post by Faras&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tLast night in Unrest I camped off the side porch <br/>\n&gt; because there was a<br/>\n&gt; \tdiscussion that singing songs off the back porch might <br/>\n&gt; be affecting<br/>\n&gt; mobs in<br/>\n&gt; \tthe basement due to an unlimited Z axis affect bug.  I <br/>\n&gt; also did not<br/>\n&gt; stand<br/>\n&gt; \taround and sing songs while our puller was in the <br/>\n&gt; house...I waited<br/>\n&gt; until our<br/>\n&gt; \tkill was brought to the fence and whacked once or twice and then<br/>\n&gt; kicked in<br/>\n&gt; \tmy playlist.  This worked awesome and I did not die once.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t think the bards invis song worked against undead.  I <br/>\n&gt; know for a<br/>\n&gt; fact I have been attacked by zombies before while singing the <br/>\n&gt; song.  Can<br/>\n&gt; someone clarify this please.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI think the people I group with generally recognize <br/>\n&gt; that I do a lot<br/>\n&gt; as a\t<br/>\n&gt; \tbard, shuffling instruments and weapons, jumping in and out of<br/>\n&gt; physical<br/>\n&gt; \tmelee, playing a variety of different songs, some <br/>\n&gt; &quot;simultaneously&quot;<br/>\n&gt; - and<br/>\n&gt; \tthey also recognize the benefit of our songs because I tell them<br/>\n&gt; things like<br/>\n&gt; \t&quot;check out your magic resist&quot; and get the &quot;wholly <br/>\n&gt; crap!&quot; or invis<br/>\n&gt; people<br/>\n&gt; \twhile they are medding and they are amazed that it works against<br/>\n&gt; undead too.<br/>\n&gt; \tOur party was sitting against the fence medding and watching a<br/>\n&gt; Festering Hag<br/>\n&gt; \trun around the yard wasting people, finally being <br/>\n&gt; killed by a group<br/>\n&gt; only 15<br/>\n&gt; \tfeet away from us - we watched the whole thing as the <br/>\n&gt; group leader<br/>\n&gt; nervously<br/>\n&gt; \tcommented &quot;don&#39;t stop singing that song Faras...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details on ONElist&#39;s new &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY&quot; program.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
