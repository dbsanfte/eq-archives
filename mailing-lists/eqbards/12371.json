Within a single<br/>\nlevel,<br/>\n&gt; the variability seems to be as much as 400%.  I do think that you lose<br/>\n&gt; significantly more in Hell Level + 1, and you APPEAR to lose significantly<br/>\nless<br/>\n&gt; in Hell Levels, but each bubble requires much more exp than the preceding<br/>\n(or<br/>\n&gt; succeeding) levels there, and I think the net exp loss is about the same<br/>\nas a<br/>\n&gt; normal level.  It would not be unlike Verant to &quot;play dice with the<br/>\nuniverse&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; considering that the amount of lost exp that is restored by Cleric spells<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; random within a set of defined parameters (e.g., 0-25%, 0-75%).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 36 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Mon, 3 Jan 2000, Daniel P.
