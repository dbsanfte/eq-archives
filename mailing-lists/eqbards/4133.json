Whether or not he thinks my prediction<br/>\napplies to him is for him to decide.

With my<br/>\n&gt; primary character, I have been to every single zone in the game except for<br/>\n&gt; Solusek A and B and Kedge Keep.  Twinking a second character does not<br/>\n&gt; detract from the experience of the game - it just makes the monotony of the<br/>\n&gt; lower levels a little bit easier, and may cut down on the deaths  that you<br/>\n&gt; would normally get from learning experience.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If it is a secondary character, then I wouldn&#39;t do it for<br/>\nreasons I&#39;ll get into in another message in a thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If this is a first time character for him, even being in full bronze at that<br/>\n&gt; level will not matter much.  Full bronze is only 1 point greater than<br/>\n&gt; banded, and alot heavier.  Also your AC is directly related to your Defense<br/>\n&gt; skill (and other modifiers.)  He is still capped at Level * 5, so at the<br/>\n&gt; most he would get maybe a 20-25 point increase in his AC rating.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The different armors types have different damage absorptions.<br/>\nI know a lot of monks who decided to switch from a Lockjaw<br/>\nvest (AC 12) to a mesh tunic (AC 8) because mesh has the<br/>\ndamage absorption of chain while the LJ vest has the<br/>\nabsorption of leather, and they were just taking less damage<br/>\nwith the mesh.  So it&#39;s not &quot;just&quot; 1 AC difference.  (Though<br/>\nI&#39;ll admit this is hearsay and I haven&#39;t tested it myself.  I<br/>\ndid take a helluva lot more damage when I tried switching from<br/>\nplate to mesh, even though my AC was over 100 points higher<br/>\nthan when I was last in banded)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
