Been in many Sebilis groups with a shaman or druid as<br/>\nprimary healer.  In those groups I always go for healing and haste (used to<br/>\nbe nivs+hymn+haste, now Catana+nivs+haste).  The only thing that annoys me<br/>\nmore then the &#39;we have to have a healer&#39; types is the &#39;have to have a<br/>\nchanter&#39; types.  Was in Sebilis the other night and we had blast in the<br/>\nbar/armorer rooms. I was primary CC and we were doing great.  Group broke up<br/>\nand the next group I was in spent the next two hours whining about how we<br/>\nhad to have and enchanter.  We could have easily gone down and rebroken the<br/>\nbar/armorer area, but instead did Gangrenous *yawn*.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Polanya Bladedancer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polanya@...\">polanya@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 30, 2001 8:38 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Soloing bards<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just gotta throw in my opinion here.  If I had waited to find <br/>\n&gt; balanced <br/>\n&gt; groups, I would<br/>\n&gt; never have gotten to 53.  I have made a considerable portion of my 53 <br/>\n&gt; levels with just a<br/>\n&gt; warrior at my side.  We welcome others to group with us <br/>\n&gt; without regard for <br/>\n&gt; class because<br/>\n&gt; for the most part we don&#39;t need any specific class.  I really <br/>\n&gt; get annoyed <br/>\n&gt; at the &quot;we have<br/>\n&gt; to have a healer&quot; types.  I am the first to admit that I am a <br/>\n&gt; cleric junkie <br/>\n&gt; but with careful<br/>\n&gt; planning, (and more careful pulling), our healing songs, and <br/>\n&gt; a stack of <br/>\n&gt; band aids we are usually fine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While I am posting, I might as well get screamed at for this <br/>\n&gt; observation.  With any healer<br/>\n&gt; type other than a cleric, I can heal the party up faster than <br/>\n&gt; they can heal <br/>\n&gt; us and then med<br/>\n&gt; up enough mana to be ready to go again.   At first I marked <br/>\n&gt; it up to a bad <br/>\n&gt; player but as I have<br/>\n&gt; partied with more folks, this observation still holds true.  <br/>\n&gt; Scream away at <br/>\n&gt; me, tell me that<br/>\n&gt; I am crazy.  No worries from me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pol<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;i find it too hard to wait around for a balanced group, so i <br/>\n&gt; grab whoever <br/>\n&gt; &gt;happens to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be around and drag em off to sebilis.  well actually most of <br/>\n&gt; the time i <br/>\n&gt; &gt;just live in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sebilis and pick up whoever happens to be hanging around the <br/>\n&gt; zonein.  so <br/>\n&gt; &gt;we usually<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have at least on hole in the group, sometimes more, heh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
