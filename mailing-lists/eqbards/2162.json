But it could also be a really cheap way of killing tough <br/>\nstuff:<br/>\nFire up Aquatic, hit Selo&#39;s, whack a red mob and leap into Lake Rathe. Then <br/>\nyou swim down, way way deep, twisting the two songs. Even if the mob&#39;s AI <br/>\ntells it to go get some air once it starts taking drowning damage it&#39;ll be <br/>\ntoo deep to make it to the surface.<br/>\nActually... come to think of it I don&#39;t believe you get xp when mobs die of <br/>\n&quot;natural causes&quot; IE: NPC&#39;s killing them, drowning and maybe falling.<br/>\nCuz then with safe-fall, we (or those odd, always vicious, monks) could <br/>\ndrag minos up to the top of the wall in the Gorge and jump off until they <br/>\ngo splat.<br/>\nAh well, they&#39;ve found a way to defeat all of my cheapness thus far, don&#39;t <br/>\nthink that&#39;ll change ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of which: I&#39;m finding Mistmoore to be great as of lvl 21+. I think <br/>\nthat&#39;s a sweetspot for me right now as my xp is zooming up nicely and it&#39;s <br/>\nactually quite fun, regardless of the repetitive nature of what I do there. <br/>\nI&#39;m pretty settled in the belief that I need to do that for a few more <br/>\nlevels until I&#39;m tough enough to wander around Guk and Cazic (sp?). I think <br/>\nI&#39;ve been everywhere, but please correct me if I&#39;m wrong: is there anywhere <br/>\nelse that&#39;s good to us at the lvl 21-24 range sort of thing? I feel I might <br/>\nsicken of Mistmoore sometime this week... once I start venturing in beyond <br/>\nthe graveyard. I&#39;ll die tons, get frustrated and spend another 3 days <br/>\nwandering from one end of Norrath to the other, just... being a bard, I <br/>\nguess ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not too bad, usually, but I just wanna get good xp for the time <br/>\nbeing - I&#39;m really keen on seeing places I barely know. (Happened to wander <br/>\ninto Nagfen&#39;s yaddayadda (can&#39;t remember the name), in Lavastorm the other <br/>\nday (and it&#39;s *not* Najena) but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going there for <br/>\nanother 2 or 3 months ;) So if anyone knows of an alternate to Mistmoore - <br/>\nas a backup for when the tedium starts setting in for me in MM please do <br/>\ntell, I&#39;d love to know.<br/>\nDud<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tFun Bob [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tSaturday, June 19, 1999 6:00 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Lake Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Fun Bob&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of drowing, does anyone else think that certain monsters other <br/>\nthan<br/>\nAqua-Goblins and such should only have a limited amount of time they can<br/>\nspend underwater before they drown?
