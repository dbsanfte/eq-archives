Both times we have done an 8+ hour camp back there, we <br/>\nhave never seen her respawn. Actually, I think you have a better <br/>\nchance of everyone walking out with new Druid boots, than to see a <br/>\nsecond Dru.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Back on topic:  Did your raid let you split her <br/>\n&gt; room with Lull?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. Luckily, Dragon&#39;s Claw is blessed with some of the best (if not <br/>\nthe best with Shaquil) pullers on the server. We have always split <br/>\nthis room with our monks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Grats again on 55. :)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you! *Smiles*<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
