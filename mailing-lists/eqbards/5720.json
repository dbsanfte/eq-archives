CHOO CHOO A COMING<br/>\nTHROUGH&quot; We saw every imaginable creature at the zone..heh  I was charmed<br/>\nalmost immediately and got to watch my friends slice me to bits (grin). Well<br/>\nthey droppped me, they dropped the named gypsy..and they looted and ran.<br/>\nWhen I got back they presented me with my very own battledrums. Do I<br/>\nrecommed going after her before your 40?..NO..but if you do..PLEASE  use as<br/>\nmuch magic resist as possible to save yourself from being charmed! Since mm<br/>\ncastle trains (at least on MY server) are an ever occuring thing, one can<br/>\nconcievabley camp the zone for the gypsy.

There were<br/>\n&gt;about 10 other players at the zone trying to fight them.
