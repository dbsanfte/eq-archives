I&#39;ve been playing my bard a whole lot more lately<br/>\nand having fun, but there are still times when I play my casters solely due<br/>\nto the inconveniences of being a melee class. ;-(<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat effects do you think would be good for us?  I know no one can be too<br/>\nthrilled about the Summon Food and Water.  What could we get that would be<br/>\nbetter used, seem like most of the other classes get truly useful effects so<br/>\nfar for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi Faegehearper<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
