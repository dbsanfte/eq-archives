If you notice on the inspection box, there&#39;s an itty-bitty black square in the upper left side of it...I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s for moving it around like the other ones.  The only problem is that the window is only up when you&#39;re inspecting something, and you can&#39;t click on the square.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll fix both problems in a patch soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like the Coldain city will be the best Tradeskill city around (or at least to park a porter mule at).
