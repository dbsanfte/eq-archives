Melee is<br/>\nking in Kunark. Before this change players who owned one haste item had a<br/>\nchoice of grouping with an enchanter, shaman or bard. All three of these<br/>\nclasses could get them to maximum haste. All three classes were equal in<br/>\nthis respect. Now there is a definite hierarchy to them.
