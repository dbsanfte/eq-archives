In this one case I hope that he is<br/>\nwrong and that CHR has an impact (other than frequency of missed notes) for<br/>\nall of our songs that can affect mobs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe should have two choices on how we play our bards: battle bard or singing<br/>\nbard.  Battle bards can stock up on STR/AGI/DEX items to make them better in<br/>\ncombat at the expense of decreased song effectiveness (due to lower CHR).<br/>\nIf I want to be a singing bard with a 200 CHR, then all of my songs should<br/>\nbe more effective than a same level bard with a lower CHR.  My guess is this<br/>\nwas too hard to code so Verant took the easy way out and made all resists<br/>\nprimarily based on your level vs the mobs level.  A 25 bard with a 90 CHR<br/>\nhas the same chance of getting a Chains to stick on a mob as a 25 bard with<br/>\na 130 CHR.  If this is how the game works (and I don&#39;t know how we will ever<br/>\nknow unless we figure out a way to test it for ourselves, sure can&#39;t believe<br/>\nwhatever Verant tells us) then its truly disappointing IMO.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; seemed that higher CHR made this song more effective.  I was under<br/>\n&gt; &gt; impression higher CHR only increased our chance of success with mind<br/>\n&gt; control<br/>\n&gt; &gt; related songs like songs like Lullaby, Charm, Pixie and Fear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I believe a higher charisma makes stat changing songs more likely to<br/>\n&gt; stick, those being the above mentioned, as well as Chains, Binding,<br/>\n&gt; possibly Chords of Cessation, maybe Denon&#39;s Dissonance, definitely Lament,<br/>\n&gt; and probably Syvelian&#39;s Antimagic Aria.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
