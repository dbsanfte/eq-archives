Hey they were sitting in the bank collecting dust. I was expecting to receive a few cp but to my surprise fer every fang turned in you get a moonstone. Now this is a new item to me and all the jewelers in town at the time. I did not let them know how to obtain because aminly , THEY WERE NOT BARDS heheheheh. But i sold two fer 10 plat a piece. Not bad fer killing a gnoll. If any body knows what these can ya let me know:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTribe<br/>\nWrath of Dragonclaw Clan currently UNKNOWN GUILD on prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
