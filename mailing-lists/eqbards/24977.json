I know he is a part of 2 quests at<br/>\n&gt; least. I think one is for receiving the Shrine key into Cobalt Scar, and the<br/>\n&gt; other I believe is for the Dragon Tooth Choker. Now I want one of these (had<br/>\n&gt; to take a faction hit for killing the stupid drake there). Sentry Kale gives<br/>\n&gt; you a note to give to Weng, who&#39;s MIA. Giving what he gives you back must be<br/>\n&gt; returned to Kale, or spawns the spy in Skyshrine in a spot at the base of<br/>\n&gt; the steps that lead up to the higher levels of the shrine. What drops from<br/>\n&gt; the spy is returned to Kale for the Choker, if memory serves me correctly.<br/>\n&gt; OK, the question is, where in the heck is wenglaks, why has he been missing<br/>\n&gt; for several patches. People can&#39;t get their shrine key without taking a<br/>\n&gt; faction hit, nor can this quest be completed. Has anyone heard what&#39;s going<br/>\n&gt; on, or have they moved Weng to another portion of Kael, harder to get to? As<br/>\n&gt; it was the guy was relatively close to the zone, although I&#39;m not sure if<br/>\n&gt; the other guys in the room would pounce on you or not. /sigh<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It could be like the NoS when they moved the loot table to Howling stones<br/>\n&gt; from Dalnir. They may have just made it a dropped item rather than<br/>\n&gt; quested....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pava<br/>\n&gt; CT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
