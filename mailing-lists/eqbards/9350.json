Seems<br/>\nlike Guardian is great for stacking with other songs but NOT the primary<br/>\nanti-magic song to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome results:<br/>\n<br/>\nGuardian only: MR 66  with MM Drum 90<br/>\nElemental only: MR 66  with MM Drum 90<br/>\nStacked only: MR 85 with MM Drum 136<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other reason I had for testing was a ranger friend recently got a Lute<br/>\nof the Gypsy Princess (LotGP which Lyssa Catalog Libaretto reveals as:<br/>\nMynthis Lute) in a trade and was trying to determine it&#39;s worth (maybe he<br/>\nwould sell it - any clue what is fair price? someone mentioned 200pp).  So,<br/>\nI said this new patch maybe has changed what it does and we went to test.<br/>\nSadly, it looks like it has no special powers for a 35 bard in hymn or<br/>\nchords.<br/>\n<br/>\nChords: no instrument 6; lute 13; LotGP 13<br/>\nHymn: no instrument 13; lute 20; LotGP 20<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, my group tried to go to Kedge Keep - get equipped for underwater<br/>\nbreathing and swim due East from Unrest - stay on the bottom and look for<br/>\nthe broken pillars - reminiscent of Najena. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe (at least most if us) zoned in and were greeted by a &quot;stiletto piranha&quot; -<br/>\nconned red to a 36 ranger and blue to a 40 SK (presumably put right there at<br/>\nhe zone to eat solo artists).  Chomp chomp - we killed him - long melee.<br/>\nHave your sta song loaded - swimming and fiting will burn sta like crazy.<br/>\nWe saw some other fishies to fight and they were blue cons to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur enchanter could not zone in - presumably her new files were corrupted in<br/>\nthe down load or some such.  And a high lev guild was taking over the place<br/>\nand would soon own the dungeon so we left to return another time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, October 28, 1999 4:22 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Observations: Upper & Lower<br/>\nGuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOn Thu, 28 Oct 1999, Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; what i thought as well.  seems like guardian would be a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>completely useless<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; song if elemental did the same MR as well as FR and CR!  i<br/>\n </span></blockquote>am pretty sure<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; guardian does more MR than elemental, but won&#39;t know til i<br/>\n </span></blockquote>get home.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tUnless it was changed it yesterday&#39;s patch, Guardian gives<br/>\nthe<br/>\n\t\tsame MR as Elemental and Purifying.

It seemed odd to me too, but<br/>\n\t\tGuardian has the advantage of stacking with certain other<br/>\n\t\tsongs (mainly Elemental and Purifying and so far all of the<br/>\n\t\tPsalm series) and giving a bigger AC boost.  A couple levels<br/>\n\t\tago, I&#39;d go from 45 to 90 MR playing Elemental, and from 90<br/>\nto<br/>\n\t\t135 MR playing Guardian on top of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--<br/>\n\t\tJohn H.
