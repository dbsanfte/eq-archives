There appears to be a damage bonus<br/>\n&gt; for the primary hand of (level-25)/3, or 8 points at<br/>\n&gt; level 50.  This 8 points is applied more often the<br/>\n&gt; faster the weapon swings and hence favors the faster<br/>\n&gt; weapon given the same dmg/delay ratio.

It does (tentatively) fit the pattern you<br/>\ndescribe, with the EBW having a slight advantage.  However,<br/>\nthe Yak&#39;s proc, even with a &gt;50% resist rate, completely<br/>\nswamps out that advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting note is that just using the raw dam/del ratio to<br/>\nget hypothetical damage figures for a planes weapon (11/25),<br/>\nit&#39;s better than a Yak + proc.
