What they are<br/>\ntrying to do is take roleplaying to one more level which is quite<br/>\nadmirable in my belief. But that is all it is, a belief. Again I<br/>\napologize for sounding brash in any way, my mouth tends to get me into<br/>\ntrouble anyway. (Most Orcs don&#39;t like being reminded of their large<br/>\nrear ends...)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, I had hoped this mailing list wouldn&#39;t turn into a debate<br/>\nbetween us, for we should use this opportunity to help each other in<br/>\nthe difficult world of a Norrath community. Not to slander each other.<br/>\nPerhaps my meaning was misunderstood before I had scrybed it down. I<br/>\nagain apologize. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also hope this can end our debate so that we can focus our attention<br/>\nto matters of bardic excellence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
