We were there<br/>\n&gt; about 4 hours and I got both items.  We had some mid 30&#39;s rangers with us<br/>\n&gt; lower 30&#39;s.  When my regular group tried to break the room at levels 24 thru<br/>\n&gt; 28 group, we got spanked.

They appear in the goblin &quot;castle&quot; area<br/>\nof Sol A.  After you zone in and crawl through the hole in the<br/>\nwall, make a right turn, hop down the ledge.  There will be a<br/>\ndoor in front of you - everything past it is the &quot;castle&quot;<br/>\narea.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest spot is the king area.  After you go through the door and<br/>\npast a grate, turn right and go straight, through a secret<br/>\nwall, follow the passage left to a door.  The four rooms past<br/>\nthat door spawn Solusek goblins, including the king (rare<br/>\nspawn).  Mages and Champions will sometimes spawn in place of<br/>\nthe normal Solusek goblins.  Beware there is a wandering Sol<br/>\ngoblin in this hallway, and all SOl goblins can see invis.  <br/>\nYou will need a full group in their low to mid 30s (enchanter<br/>\nhighly recommended until they fix Lullaby - this was the last<br/>\nplace I got to use Lullaby before they broke it).  The king<br/>\ndrops a +str ring, and a so-so sceptre.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot quite as plentiful is the high shaman area.  It&#39;s a dead<br/>\nend so it&#39;s relatively safe.  It&#39;s past the bar area.  Up to<br/>\nfour Solusek goblins spawn in the two rooms that make up the<br/>\nhigh shaman area (vs. 3-4 in the king room, 3 in the adjacent<br/>\nroom, 2 in the room after, all of whom can heal through the<br/>\nwalls).  You could hold this room with just 3-4 low- to<br/>\nmid-30s, although you might need more to take it.  The shaman<br/>\ndrops a nice ring that grants infravision (useful for blind<br/>\nhumans).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen a Solusek goblin spawn *in* the bar area.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a nice place to camp though, as there are a ton of<br/>\ngoblins nearby, each separated into different rooms (i.e. if<br/>\nyou have a tough fight, you can just skip a room while you<br/>\nrest without screwing up the spawn pattern).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
