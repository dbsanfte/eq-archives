To me<br/>\nthat sounds like people are saying he&#39;ll be a twink if he goes out and sells the<br/>\ncrown to buy decent armor and equipment instead of hoarding it in the bank until<br/>\nhe is of the &quot;appropriate&quot; level to go and kill the King in runnyeye.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp,<br/>\nTaelin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Uhhmmm I don&#39;t think anyone contested this particular fellow aquiring of<br/>\n&gt; the item.  If fact a good amount of advice was spawn from his question.<br/>\n&gt; What your seeing now is not the evaluation of him twinking, rather it has<br/>\n&gt; evolved into a debate about the merits of  twinking.  This thread spawned<br/>\n&gt; due to the two courses of actions suggested by the list.  If you look back<br/>\n&gt; you will find that at no time did we accuse him twinking though we were<br/>\n&gt; all a bit envious =).  I guess it is time to shange the topic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Treilanin Loreweaver </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
