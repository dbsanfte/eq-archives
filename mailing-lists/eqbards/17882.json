In Hate this weekend, my job became crowd control.  Whenever<br/>\n&gt; two things came in on a pull, I would charm the second, command it to /pet<br/>\n&gt; guard here (sit down always made them wander off), run a ways away, and<br/>\n&gt; reassert charm till it broke and retook.  Working in concert with an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter casting tashania, I could charm anything that came in save<br/>\n&gt; clerics (never tried) and spites.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I finally feel like my old level 30 self again.  This weekend I led an<br/>\nEfreeti run.  On the third pull someone wandered off a little too far and<br/>\nagroed 2 Lava Guardians and 3 Imps right after we had finished off an imp.<br/>\nOur enchanter went OOM after the first of the 3 remaining Imps fell leaving<br/>\nme to crowd control alone.  Using Charm on one of the imps, I was able to<br/>\nkeep both imps busy while we were able to finish off the lava elementals and<br/>\nthen the imps with no further casualties :).  From that point forward, the<br/>\nenchanter and I had it worked out so that I would charm the extra incoming<br/>\nin each pull and keep them busy while he mezzed singles.  I would then tell<br/>\nhim when the charm broke so he could start mezzing my pet.  This had the<br/>\nnice effect of keeping the imp pounding on me instead of the enchanter until<br/>\nhe could get the mez to stick as well as giving us an extra hand in battle.<br/>\nWe repeated the process every time mez broke as well with great success.<br/>\nThe enchanter barely took damage the rest of the break in and used a lot<br/>\nless mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was EXTREMELY tempted to attempt pulling for this raid...  I really wanted<br/>\nto try out a combination of Lament and charm to pull on these to see if I<br/>\ncould really control the pulling better then the monk.  In the end I went<br/>\nwith traditional break in techniques but I&#39;m not so sure the traditional<br/>\nbreak in is the best way to go anymore.  Have any of you tried Lament on the<br/>\nImp or Lava guardians or been the puller for the Efreeti raid?  If Lament<br/>\nwould work, I really think that a single well balanced party of 6 might be<br/>\nable to handle the break in alone.... :)  If none of you have tried it, I<br/>\nthink I might go for it next weekend...<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, 2 Efreeti in the first 3 spawns and then we were shut out with only<br/>\nplace holders for the next 10 hours...<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 48th song<br/>\nPrexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
