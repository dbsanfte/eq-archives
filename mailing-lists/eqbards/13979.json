Then I said crawling and camping<br/>\nwere mutually exclusive.  Then a bunch of people posted ideas<br/>\nabout how to make the game crawling-based instead of<br/>\ncamping-based, which is when I started putting (OT) on it.  <br/>\nSorry about not changing the subject line.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
