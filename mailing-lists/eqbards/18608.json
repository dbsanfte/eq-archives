In general, I think the kinds of people who are attracted<br/>\nto small guilds because &quot;we only invite people everyone likes&quot; are less<br/>\ninclined to be able to play this way, while those that end up joining<br/>\nlarger guilds aren&#39;t. Planes and dragon raids (and dungeon raids in<br/>\nKunark to a large extent) require a lot of trust in the other people, as<br/>\nyou will often have to consent someone else to move your corpse. They<br/>\nalso require a willingness to follow directions from whoever is the<br/>\nleader, sometimes in spite of any opinion you might have that it&#39;s<br/>\ntotally the wrong thing to be doing.  With a collection of smaller<br/>\nguilds, this is a lot more difficult to manage.  The only way I could<br/>\nsee this happening is for a group of small guilds to work up to it and<br/>\ntry to build the trust and teamwork, maybe starting with Kedge raids or<br/>\nsome of the easier dungeons in Kunark, which are empty enough that they<br/>\ngive you lots of practice working as a team to clear unfamiliar ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
