He is basically on the opposite side of the<br/>\ntemple from Genni, and down one floor. It&#39;s an even trade, one lambent<br/>\nstone, one Darkwood staff. Stats on the staff are:<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkwood Staff: Magical 1HB, 5/28, Wt6.5, All/All, NOT LORE, NOT NODROP,<br/>\nGraphic is same as a cracked staff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the stats aren&#39;t bad, but would only be of intrest for a pure caster<br/>\nI think. Druids, Shamen, etc. could get a combine morningstar 8/38,<br/>\nwhich comes out to a much better weapon. Or if they wanted something<br/>\nfaster, a combine warhammer, 6/30. Comparing it to other weapons, It is<br/>\nEXACTLY the same as the Water Crystal Staff, which sells for 85-100pp,<br/>\nbut is involved in a quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made 2 and sold both for 40pp. This may be why people are not letting<br/>\ngo of stones so quickly. On the other hand, I watched a high level SK<br/>\nkill a SG in Oasis, and immediately after the fight he /told me &quot;stone<br/>\non SG if you want it&quot;. I offered to heal/regen him fo it, he thought it<br/>\nwas a good trade :).<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n35th Bard, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
