It certainly<br/>\napplies to me. I have been playing my bard on Mith Marr almost exclusively<br/>\nsince day 1 of the commercial release, and am now only 18th level despite<br/>\nplaying almost every day. I don&#39;t play for more than an hour or two,<br/>\ntypically, occasionally three or four, and I have noticed in that time that<br/>\nsome of the people I have played with in the past are now level 50, but the<br/>\nlarger majority of them are still around my level, or at least within 5<br/>\nlevels or so of me. So, this leads me to believe that there are more of<br/>\nthose who are in the situation where a death really does mean the end of<br/>\nyour effective playing for the evening. I know that is my case, and it seems<br/>\nthat if I have more exp when I log than I did when I started, I am beginning<br/>\nto consider that a darned good night. Mostly since I started hunting in<br/>\nUnrest, though! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, more casual, time limited players who are in this situation, are less<br/>\nlikely to read and post to the EQ liasts, thus they are not heard from.<br/>\nI know I would love to get bind, simply for the fact that it would make the<br/>\ngame more enjoyable for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, for those who would like more challenge, simply do not purchase the<br/>\nsong, and for you, nothing changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAranlas Starchaser<br/>\nBard of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSent: 10/1/99 12:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni understand your position, i just don&#39;t know how many people it applies<br/>\nto.<br/>\ni actually am enjoying this discussion, i like debating intelligently,<br/>\nwithout getting TOO offensive =)  and damn it really got this list<br/>\ngoing, i<br/>\nhaven&#39;t even been able to read the other posts like the bard letter to<br/>\nGZ<br/>\nPart Three.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; true but it has obviously been a small percentage of your <br/>\n&gt; actual playing<br/>\n&gt; time as evidenced by your levels.  Your lowest level <br/>\n&gt; character probably has<br/>\n&gt; more playing time than my highest.  Dying for me doesn&#39;t just <br/>\n&gt; mean running<br/>\n&gt; across some zones and back to playing.  It often means <br/>\n&gt; running across some<br/>\n&gt; zones and quitting for the night. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
