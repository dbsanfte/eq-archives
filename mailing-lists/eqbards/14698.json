I get a lot of <br/>\nlower-level bards /telling me with questions (some of whom have done so <br/>\nmany times now) and I will always answer if I know (and will point them <br/>\nto Harmonic if I don&#39;t, jk).  If you (Miriana? I lost the original <br/>\nmessage) get some nasty response, then *that* player is a jerk, not *all* <br/>\nhigher-level players.  Try someone else on the list.  (/who all bard 40 <br/>\n50)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had a lot of corpse retrieval requests lately, far more than I used <br/>\nto, and I&#39;ve found these to be a lot of fun, too.  I always help on these <br/>\nif it isn&#39;t going to hold up a group.  Takes me to areas I never had the <br/>\ntime (or nerve) to go to before.  See the world!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a guy in Rivervale ask me if I could help locate his corpse and it <br/>\nturned out that he had a high-level Druid that got wiped because he quit <br/>\nfor six months (characters don&#39;t last forever), and he wasn&#39;t aware of <br/>\nthe Kithicor changes.  It was a lot of fun to bring him up to date, and I <br/>\nended up giving him six pieces of banded/bronze armor to fill in what he <br/>\nwas missing *because he didn&#39;t ask*.  All of these, for me, are part of <br/>\nthe fun of being higher level.  What isn&#39;t fun is all the level 1 <br/>\nbeggars.  I really don&#39;t know where these guys get the nerve.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I play my lower level characters, I will /yell if in trouble, I will <br/>\nflirt, I will give assistance, I will /moan if injured, but I will <br/>\n*never* ask another player for money or items.  That just seems really <br/>\ncrass to me, and I don&#39;t think it should be rewarded (unless the player <br/>\nis particularly amusing about it, which happens...)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 42 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
