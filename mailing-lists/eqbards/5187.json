I am a lv 23<br/>\nbard and last night while kiting a Stone Guardian in Nectulos Forest I was<br/>\nexperiencing quite a bit of lost notes while singing the standard bellow<br/>\nbellow accelerando combo.  In the end I had about 10-12 missed notes on<br/>\nthe bellow and about 5 on the accelerando.  So here is my info to find out<br/>\nif it may be server, or even server group related.  I myself have been<br/>\ngetting bad server lag spikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLvl 23<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\nWood Elf Bard<br/>\nDEX 102<br/>\nCHA 96<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this will help us get to the bottom of this.  Now I do wonder if<br/>\ncasters are experiences differ between varying servers.  I myself have had<br/>\nstrange increase in fizzles and interrupted spells with my lvl 17<br/>\nmagician. <br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nAariel<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 11 Aug 1999, Lost Child wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Lost Child&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lostchild@...\">lostchild@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Could the missed notes only happens on certain server(s)?  I am a lv 44 bard <br/>\n&gt; on Cazic-Thule server, and I haven&#39;t notice any extra missed notes since <br/>\n&gt; this thing started.  Not enough to notice it anyway.  Or maybe it only <br/>\n&gt; affects wood elf or human bard?  I am a half elf.  Or maybe it is level <br/>\n&gt; related?  Seems like a lot of the people who have the missed notes are in <br/>\n&gt; their high 20s to high 30s. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
