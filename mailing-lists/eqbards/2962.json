He must&#39;ve been around 11th lvl or so (conned RED to me <br/>\nat 8th) and he wasn&#39;t very effective at killing me. I ran, he followed, <br/>\nwhacking me on occasion until I bagged my one piece of Banded Mail and he <br/>\nrealized it wasn&#39;t worth killing me for a rusty sword (explanation for <br/>\nthose not on the PVP server: You can only loot one item from your victims <br/>\nand you can NOT loot anything from a container so it&#39;s common to see people <br/>\nletting themselves get hit while they put all their good stuff away. <br/>\nRidiculous? Yep. Funny? Indeed!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say though - I was very disappointed that a Bard was trying to <br/>\nslaughter someone green simply for a piece of equipment, he even had the RP <br/>\nflag on (for what that&#39;s worth) but I guess it takes all sorts eh? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDud<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tAlexis Muhly [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:acmuhly@...\">acmuhly@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tTuesday, July 06, 1999 7:02 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] Greetings<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Alexis Muhly&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:acmuhly@...\">acmuhly@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI&#39;ve just sub&#39;d to the list and wanted to introduce myself.
