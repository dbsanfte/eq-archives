We&#39;re talking about Seafury Cyclops right?  In OOT?  If so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see how a single group could keep that island clear unless perhaps<br/>\nthat was a group of six necros soloing.  Those things spawn *rediculously*<br/>\nfast.  Earlier I said they pop like Moss Snakes and I meant it.  Perhaps<br/>\nyour server is different, but I&#39;ve never seen that island cleared of cyclops<br/>\neven with three high 40s groups working it.<br/>\n<br/>\n[44 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Heh even without necros I think  my necro and a 42 enchanter<br/>\n&gt; friend kept the<br/>\n&gt; isle basically cleared. Often times I&#39;ll go there and they&#39;ll will be one<br/>\n&gt; group who keeps it cleared without necros. Just need to have the<br/>\n&gt; right group<br/>\n&gt; for it. Besides which as I stated that place is camped like mad and they<br/>\n&gt; recently lowered exp that you get from furies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
