I remember how bad I hated the new zones when<br/>\nRoK came out. Oh so big, but then with SoV they seemed to scale them smaller<br/>\nthan RoK, but larger than the first ever zones in Everquest. I sure hope the<br/>\nMoon has about the same size zones as Great Divide, I think that is about<br/>\nthe perfect size zone. So has anyone heard?  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tTalies the Wanderer [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tWednesday, November 07, 2001 12:30 PM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\tRe: EK at 16 (was:RE: [eqbards] JM Capozi)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt 01:26 PM 11/7/2001 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt;I was going solo at that level in EK.
