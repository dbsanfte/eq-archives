Wasn&#39;t aware any other hybrids got more songs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGotta love that one.  They couldn&#39;t own up to the fact they screwed up by<br/>\nnot increasing the ranger defensive stats, so to save face they give Rangers<br/>\na spell to lower their hate list factor.  So much for Symphonic Harmony<br/>\nbeing unique to bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit the cynical<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it, all it takes is a patch where they don&#39;t tell us things that we<br/>\ninstantly find out anyway, to make me cynical once again. <br/>\nThere was also some talk last night of new hybrid spells available from<br/>\nvendors.  I checked our vendor in FV and no new songs.  I suppose I&#39;m not<br/>\nbeing literal enough; I&#39;d be nuts to confuse songs with &#39;spells&#39;, right? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-KS</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
