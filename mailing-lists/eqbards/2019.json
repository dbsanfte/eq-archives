I was expecting to sit around<br/>\nfor hours but as I get there, there were 6 campers of lvl 20+.  I asked them<br/>\nif I can get a dirk and they said sure.  So I got one for free in 15 minutes<br/>\nof getting to CB.  Then one of the guy left so I join their team to get<br/>\nanother one for my other rogue char.  To keep the story short, Divinni spawn<br/>\nevery 15 minutes, and each time he has the dirk.  We were giving the dirk<br/>\naway to our friends, relatives, and just unknown plp.  I just think that a<br/>\nweapon of that power should be more rare or harder to get.  This dirk is<br/>\nbetter than a well balance ls!!!!!  So now I have 2 dirk.  1 for me lvl 17<br/>\nbard and 1 for my lvl 17 rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just my 2 coppers.<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Samiam<br/>\nChampions of Norrath, The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
