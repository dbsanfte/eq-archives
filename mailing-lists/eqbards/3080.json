Where should<br/>\nI go from here? I could stay here and kill mino&#39;s, but they&#39;re too hard to find (camped most of the<br/>\ntime). Where should I go from here? What&#39;s good for level 12? Any help is greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMay I HIGHLY recommend soloing the aquagoblins on the rocks just inside the Ocean of Tears from<br/>\nButcherblock (not on the spires which I suspect are a deathtrap from falling). Jump off the boat and<br/>\nclimb up on the rock that has the two Alluring Sirens. There are two aquagoblins on that rock and<br/>\nanother close by with 3 on it. Destroy any rusty weapons and fill your pack with bows (2gp each from<br/>\nthe High elf at BB dock if you charm him).  Great exp, good loot and great fun.To get back on the<br/>\nboat swim towords it when it is coming at you, angle up and you will pop up inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you hit 13 may I then suggest wisps in Erudes crossing (assuming you have a magic weapon) for<br/>\ntotal tedium but GREAT money and exp, exploring Kithicor for fun and danger (good exp, little<br/>\nmoney),  go back to wack gnoll commanders in Blackbullow :o) for being such bullies when you were<br/>\nweaker.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 14 try Lavastorm! Woooo what a blast. I am soloing there now (hit 15 last night). As bards here<br/>\nis the tip: blue Firedrakes and Stone Dervishes (maybe rock bascilisks) GOOD, blue and even kinda<br/>\ngreen Fire Elems BAD. Blue Fire Elems will kick your butt into next tuesday. Same for Rock Crawlers.<br/>\nI am guessing that Feerot might be good to solo now too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, I like to travel *smiles*<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if I can just find a brigandine tunic...*sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz, Scarlet Moon, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
