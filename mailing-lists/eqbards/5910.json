They were destroyed before I ever even got to try them<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent email to the customer service manager at Verant.  I won&#39;t waste the<br/>\nspace reproducing it here unless requested to, but I attempted to make it<br/>\nintelligent and constructive but I did color it with my anger and aggrevation<br/>\nat the loss when it occurred.  I asked what the appropriate venue was to air<br/>\nmy complaint (i.e. who to send further email to) about this loss for possible<br/>\nrestoration, and stated that I agreed with the logic behind LORE.  I then<br/>\nasked what the logic was of having LORE items destroyed when dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was his reply to me:<br/>\n<br/>\n------<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Jason,<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume you purchased a ONE claw? They are lore items so it would be<br/>\nimpossible to possess two. I will direct the server GM to return you one<br/>\nclaw. In the near future we are changing the code to not destroy lore items<br/>\nwhen they are dropped. You will see that information on the patch server<br/>\nmessage when it is ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for your distress and inconvenience!<br/>\n<br/>\n------<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you say HOT DAMN!  It would appear that I&#39;m going to get my Claw restored<br/>\nto me.  I got this email this morning, so it&#39;s unlikely that the Claw is<br/>\nactually restored to me yet but I&#39;ll be checking first thing when I get home<br/>\ntonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI replied to him briefly saying basically &#39;Many will be relieved when LORE<br/>\nitems are not destroyed when dropped.&#39;, and thanking him for his unexpected<br/>\nrestoration.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier - a very happy 18th song Bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\nYoyodyne - 23rd level monk on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.
