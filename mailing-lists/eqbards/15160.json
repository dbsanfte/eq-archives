They<br/>\n&gt;shouldn&#39;t have just<br/>\n&gt;had one class be involved in many of these quests.  In trade<br/>\n&gt;skills, image that<br/>\n&gt;a bard was necessary to create even better armor/weapons- the bard<br/>\n&gt;can sing his<br/>\n&gt;song to make sure that the metal used is &quot;pure&quot;, or that the seams are &quot;in<br/>\n&gt;harmony&quot; (giving them additional strenght).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*sigh* I play an enchanter too.
