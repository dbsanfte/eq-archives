No<br/>\nchange, as soon as I came up to the group, Giants just starting charging out<br/>\nof the fort...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not going to sue charm and see if it still happenes tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
