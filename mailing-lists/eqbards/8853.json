So far I have five quest components.  I have been<br/>\nauctioning to buy a lambent stone ever since the patch came out.  I have<br/>\ntried this in every zone I pass through.  Not once has anyone had one to<br/>\nsell.  I&#39;ve asked my guild to be on the lookout for them.  Despite killing<br/>\nnumerous giants, no one in my guild has looted one.  Do lambent stones only<br/>\nget dropped in specific zones or can they get dropped in any zone with a<br/>\ngiant or griffin?  How often do they get dropped?   <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, can non-bards complete the bard armor quests in order to sell the<br/>\nlambent armor pieces?  If the armor is NO DROP, I guess its possible that<br/>\npeople are hanging on to lambent stones so they can complete the quests.  I<br/>\nknow most of the quest components are NO DROP but I can&#39;t remember if the<br/>\nlambent armor is NO DROP so can someone confirm this for me?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
