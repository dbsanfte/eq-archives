There are many of the quests for other classes I can do for those in<br/>\nmy guild.  They don&#39;t do them because they can&#39;t travel as fast as I can and<br/>\nthey don&#39;t enjoy questing and travelling like I do.  They are willing to<br/>\ntrade me things they camp for (Yech I hate camping) when I do get them a<br/>\npiece of quest armor.  They could have gotten the armor themselves in most<br/>\ncases but are not interesting in all the running around.  If all the quest<br/>\narmor was no drop that would just be another set of quests I could do but<br/>\nthen have to just destroy the results.  At the cost of those pieces I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t afford to do that and there would suddenly be no reason to do it<br/>\neither.  as stated before by others unless you make everything no drop,<br/>\nthere&#39;s not much point in making a lot of things no drop.  There&#39;s nothing I<br/>\nhate more than doing a quest which I often have spent hours, or days, or<br/>\neven levels, (off and on) completing, only to be rewarded with a really cool<br/>\nitem for another class, that I can&#39;t even give or sell to someone else<br/>\nbecause it is no drop.  I still have a Collar of Neshika in the bank from<br/>\ndoing the tiger quest hoping to get something to trade to a monk friend who<br/>\nhas an obsidian shard in the bank I could use, only to find out its no drop.<br/>\nBelieve me, that feeling is every bit as big a let down as seeing some twink<br/>\nhalf your level run by with better stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n\tQuesting somewhere on E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
