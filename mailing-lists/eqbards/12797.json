Let me know what you think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and maybe it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something else we can post on the official EQ message board.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would like to see a new /who command added to the game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The command would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; work like this.  You type in /who &quot;zone name&quot; and it tells<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you who all is in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t think of any way this would affect any class balance issue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Assuming that class balance is not affected in any manner by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; adding this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; /who command, the only reason I can think of to not implement<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is that it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is too hard to code.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Comments?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been wanting something like this for a long time, and I agree with<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; justifications as to why this would greatly help the game. Ultimately,<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; performs the same parsing as any other &quot;/who all XXXXX&quot; command, so I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t think that this is all that more complicated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ideally, they could make this &quot;who&quot; command a bit more powerful by<br/>\nallowing<br/>\n&gt; us to essentially &quot;grep&quot; the &quot;who all&quot; command.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As an addition, I&#39;ve always had problems finding my guildmates for one of<br/>\n&gt; the guilds that I belong to. Someone tried convincing me that there was a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;/who all guild&quot; command, but that certainly doesn&#39;t work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For Windleaf, who belongs to &quot;Guardians of the Divine Light&quot;, I can find<br/>\nany<br/>\n&gt; of his buddies with a &quot;/who all guard&quot; command. But the other guildname<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t work as the GM had to tweak the name, so the guildname is &quot; Order<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; the Sacred Nut&quot; (it&#39;s meant to be funny :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Notice the space character in front of the name. This screws up any chance<br/>\n&gt; for me to see who else in this guild is logged on, but was the solution by<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; the GM since there was another &quot;Order of the Sacred (something)&quot; on the<br/>\n&gt; server and the server only recognizes the first 16 characters according to<br/>\n&gt; the GM. So she added a &quot; &quot; in front of the name. At the time I didn&#39;t<br/>\nargue.<br/>\n&gt; (Believe me, it&#39;s a real long story).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---Windleaf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;   You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;   You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
