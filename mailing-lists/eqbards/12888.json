Everyone digs in, and as it nears death the stone spider<br/>\nspawns and leaps toward the nearest pet.  The warrior ended up with about<br/>\n3 bubbles of health from the ldc, and I had 2.5 with bloodboil (figured he<br/>\nhad it too), so I stood back and played hymn a bit, took a few swipes,<br/>\ntried to stick largo&#39;s (that thing has the highest MR I&#39;ve seen yet;<br/>\ngranted bigger stuff I&#39;ve seen was debuffed post haste), managed to get<br/>\nmyself stunned, beat up some more, lost the necro pet and finally eked out<br/>\na victory over the thing for a well-earned BCP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just glad I didn&#39;t have to mez it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren Notechaser, 44th composition in progress<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
