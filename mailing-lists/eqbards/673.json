You must NOT<br/>\nsing Accelerondo, as it is too easy to fall off the cliff (there are some tricky, but very possible,<br/>\ncorners). When you do fall, you need to beat it back up the cliff stay put, and heal. There is only<br/>\none place where you breifly cannot keep to the cliff.Be patient and everything will go fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went from Kelethin to Qeynos as an eight level bard, I went via Highpass Hold and skidded stunned<br/>\nto the zone, it was VERY close. On the return trip I died once in the gorge trying to rush through,<br/>\nbut succeeded with a calm approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other trick is, only EVER run the edge of the zone, do NOT take the roads.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz, Bard of Faydark<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I highly suggest you avoid beholder & runny eye, and go thru Highpass<br/>\n&gt;Hold.<br/>\n&gt;During peak hours, you can walk thru HH unscathed. There are plenty of<br/>\n&gt;lvl 20 players camping all the orcs and gnolls that spawn there. Its so<br/>\n&gt;safe, you could even look around and explore a bit. Why would you want<br/>\n&gt;to risk going thru beholder and getting attacked by 10 things? And then<br/>\n&gt;attempting to outrun them? You&#39;re not going to out run a damn thing when<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re stunned. And if an evil eye happens to cross you, you&#39;re screwed.<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;ll either nuke you to hell (can&#39;t out run nukes) or it&#39;ll charm you,<br/>\n&gt;and let some muddites or minotaurs munch on you. Minotaurs hit HARD, and<br/>\n&gt;Muddites can blind you.<br/>\n&gt;Thats not even the worst part. If you were to die, you&#39;d have one hell<br/>\n&gt;of a corpse retrieval. You might be able to get someone to invis you,<br/>\n&gt;but evil eyes can detect invis (I think). </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
