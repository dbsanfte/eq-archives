I receive <br/>\n&gt;over<br/>\n&gt;200 messages a day from several mailing lists, family, friends.  I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;any idea what most of these acronyms are and when I find them in a message <br/>\n&gt;I am<br/>\n&gt;curious as to what they mean, but as before mentioned, I still have 200 or <br/>\n&gt;more<br/>\n&gt;messages to read.  This leaves me little time to reply to people, let alone <br/>\n&gt;go<br/>\n&gt;to a web site with an EverQuest dictionary.  Nor do I contain any desire to <br/>\n&gt;go<br/>\n&gt;there and look up a word each time.<br/>\n&gt;      Here&#39;s a good one for you, everyone pretty much knows what a zipper <br/>\n&gt;is, or<br/>\n&gt;has one on a least one article of clothing, but when i told my 10 year old<br/>\n&gt;nephew to XYZ-PDQ he had no clue what I was talking about.  In other words,<br/>\n&gt;just because I play the game doesn&#39;t mean I know every piece of language <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;lore about it, nor do I care to.<br/>\n&gt;      But it would be nice if people would just spell out what it is they <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;talking about, it would make me more interested in the messages that <br/>\n&gt;contain<br/>\n&gt;these acronyms.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tadian the flame receiver of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;p.s. I DO know what FBR is...Full Black Robe.  But I guess that is just <br/>\n&gt;because<br/>\n&gt;for the last 5 days some idiot has been screaming it across east karana, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;each time he does some person new to the area, generally barbarians, will <br/>\n&gt;shout<br/>\n&gt;back...&quot;What is a FBR?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bob Stewart wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dreambard@...\">dreambard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 09:30 AM 7/23/99 -0400, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ah! You just need the secret decoder ring. Here ya go:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry, wrong answer.  Doesn&#39;t scale.  Barely works at all.  Using <br/>\n&gt;acronyms<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t widely known is inconsiderate of those with whom you are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supposedly trying to communicate.  Pointing people to an immense list of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; definitions is simply a way of saying you can&#39;t be bothered to type out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; words that would be relatively sufficient.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Overuse of acronyms was one of the problems that made IBM systems <br/>\n&gt;difficult<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and limited their use to the priesthood.  More considerate computer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; companies moved away from secret code.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Acronyms are the rudest form of slang and jargon.  They are even worse <br/>\n&gt;than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obscure words like &quot;proc&quot; because they aren&#39;t even pronouncable words.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Acronyms are effectively a way to invent new words on the fly, then use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them and berate the reader for not knowing what they mean.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll warn you now that I&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the computer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; industry for 30 years, with some success.  People either get the point <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behave less rudely or miss the point and continue to speak in secret <br/>\n&gt;code,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either not understanding or simply not caring whether they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt;communicating<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the majority of their audience.  If you don&#39;t mind if the majority <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the readers simply don&#39;t know what you meant and probably won&#39;t bother <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find out, use them, but don&#39;t kid yourself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Bob<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
