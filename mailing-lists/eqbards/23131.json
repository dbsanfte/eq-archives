Atonal didn&#39;t get logged on this weekend, only<br/>\nbecause my guild grouping partners never showed, at least when I was on.<br/>\nThat and my druid was almost 19, and I really was psyched about being able<br/>\nto self teleport...hehe...and trying to do the bone talisman quest.  Just<br/>\nway into the druid.  :)  Speaking of bone talisman...about 2 hours killing<br/>\nthat dumb tiger, and nothing but ruined cat pelts...  :/  If anyone here on<br/>\nXegony has a tiger hide laying around, I&#39;ll buy it...hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Robert(Bob) Smith [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rws1111@...\">rws1111@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 15, 2001 9:52 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Lots-o-questions...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n#1) The new changes with Selos has added some new excitement to the <br/>\ngame - I think I was more scared running through Burning Woods <br/>\nyesterday than I have been since I first entered the zone. In the <br/>\npast, I always knew I could outrun anything I might aggro... yesterday, <br/>\nI was not so sure. *Grins*<br/>\n<br/>\n#2) I have been thinking about trying to get a SS bracer, but really <br/>\ndo not want to put the time in the camp. EQ Prices has them listed in <br/>\nthe 2K-2.5K range, but a couple of my friends kinda laughed and said <br/>\nI would be looking in the 10K-15K range... what is the price of the <br/>\nbracer, and how good are they? (BTW, this is on Xegony.)<br/>\n<br/>\n#3) Speaking of equipment, I think it is time I look at replacing my <br/>\nLizardscale cloak. (I am level 52) I have been getting a LOT of grief <br/>\nfrom my guildmates over this (much as I did when they found out I was <br/>\nstill wearing a collar of undead protection.) Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n#4) I have been having some trouble evaluating the worth of the level <br/>\n52 song. Have anyone found it to good/bad?<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Comments:<br/>\n*) Tawney: Still in 59? I am rooting for ya!<br/>\n*) Dark: Sorry I could not chat more in HS last night... I hope your <br/>\nraid went well.<br/>\n*) Atonal: I looked for you this weekend, but did not see you online. <br/>\nMaybe I was looking at the wrong time?<br/>\n*) Slyde: Better hurry out of 52, or I might just beat ya to 53. <br/>\n*Grins*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
