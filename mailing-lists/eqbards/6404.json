Since I am currently in Kaladim, I thought I would give<br/>\n&gt; Unrest<br/>\n&gt; a try.<br/>\n&gt; My questions are this: what songs should i be using primarily-both as a<br/>\n&gt; battle bard and as a buff party bard?<br/>\n&gt; My current machime though is only a p233 and weaving more than 2 songs,<br/>\n&gt; maybe 3 on a good connection day, is about my max-2 being the norm for me.<br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions and tips would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scanna Swiftsinger<br/>\n&gt; 28th Chorus<br/>\n&gt; Bertox Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does Windows keep &quot;&quot;bugging&quot;&quot; you?
