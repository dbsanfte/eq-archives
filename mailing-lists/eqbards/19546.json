After breaking the camp, we settled into<br/>\na nice three hour session of &quot;Pop-n-Pull&quot;, (Me-34th lvl bard, 36 druid, 39<br/>\nthen dinged to 40 druid, a 40-ish mage, then later a 32 druid joined us),<br/>\nexcept for one time where our puller pulled one and another spawned right in<br/>\nhis path.  While the exp was nice, the loot was not worth our time.  All<br/>\ntold, we came away with 1 Black Pearl, 1 Axe of the Iron Back, a Word, and a<br/>\nsum total of 10pp in coins.  Was I expecting Forest Loops in every drop?<br/>\nNo.  But to personally loot 8-9 giants and have 5 or 6 with *nothing* (no<br/>\nitems or money) is just wrong.  From even just a coinage standpoint, I would<br/>\nhave come out muuuuch better by far if I had just gone to SK and camped the<br/>\nHermit :oP<br/>\n&gt; Is it my imagination, or did someone at Verant make a comment along the<br/>\nlines of loot being comparable to the difficulty of the creature?  FYI:<br/>\nthose giants are quite tough ;o)~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One more thing:  How much is Singing Steel going for on the other servers?<br/>\nSaw a level one bard mule last night auctioning SS Boots.  He told me he can<br/>\nget 15k plat for them.  For that much, I&#39;ld rather  just try to organize a<br/>\nguild event in Karnor&#39;s and loot them myself :oP<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=B=-<br/>\n&gt; 34th<br/>\n&gt; The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit Expedia.com for a chance to win airfare to Vegas for you and<br/>\n&gt; 20 friends, $15,000 and a suite at Bellagio for New Year&#39;s.
