The point on Selo&#39;s and SoW cancelling it has<br/>\n&gt; been removed, as a fix for this has been put in with the last patch.<br/>\n&gt; I almost took out the point about our skills capping too low, as a few<br/>\n&gt; people felt that 40 foraging is adequate, but more people seemed to agree<br/>\n&gt; that this skill caps too low to be useful, so I&#39;m leaving it.  I&#39;ve added a<br/>\n&gt; point regarding the lack of instrument information when right clicking on a<br/>\n&gt; song in our spellbooks (as suggested by John).<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m starting to lose my steam on this now, so if there are no further<br/>\n&gt; comments/corrections/suggestions/ additions, this will be the version that I<br/>\n&gt; send in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elwyn Heartstring<br/>\n&gt; Level 43 Bard<br/>\n&gt; Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>\n&gt; game.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.  If<br/>\n&gt; they are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests) please<br/>\n&gt; at least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to<br/>\n&gt; get them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste our time<br/>\n&gt; questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to have no<br/>\n&gt; effect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many bards.  It<br/>\n&gt; does not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it should) nor does<br/>\n&gt; it protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please confirm whether<br/>\n&gt; this song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>\n&gt; looks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>\n&gt; patch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>\n&gt; regularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>\n&gt; expect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>\n&gt; equipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>\n&gt; wrists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4) There seems to be an absense of any high level bard quests.  Is there any<br/>\n&gt; implementation planned for these?  When might we expect them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5) Spellcasters, when they right click on a spell can see what skill the<br/>\n&gt; spell uses, along with its casting time.  Why doesn&#39;t the bard spell book<br/>\n&gt; show what instrument skill is required when you right click on a song?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 6) Some of our skills (Hiding, Forage) cap at such low levels, that they<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of these, but if the caps<br/>\n&gt; were raised such that at least they worked more than<br/>\n&gt; 1 out of 20 times, we might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
