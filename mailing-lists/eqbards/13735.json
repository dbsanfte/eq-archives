Crowding is a problem for higher level<br/>\nplayers  like yourself, but that does not make it less of a problem for us mid<br/>\nlevel players. Part of the problem is maybe also that when you hit 50 like I<br/>\nbelive you have mentioned there is only so much you can do today. I can imagine<br/>\nthat after a while you get the feeling that you have &quot;won&quot; the game? If thats<br/>\nthe case then overcrowding is not the main problem, but rather Lack of 46+<br/>\nthings to do. As it is today and nomatter how you turn and twist it I still<br/>\nthink that the wast marjority of the players are -40 Esp after the slew of new<br/>\nplayers that entered after christmas. Verant are working on helping you guys. We<br/>\ncan argue about how well they are doing (As far as I remember all new zones<br/>\nexcept Temple of Ro have been 46+ zones), further more changes in spawns have<br/>\nalso been targeted at the rising average level of players (Paw, Kithior, Solusek<br/>\nRo quests).<br/>\nI can only imagnine how it would be if I played when there is 2000+ players on<br/>\nBertox.. I think the 900-1000 players(was 500-600 before christmas) that is<br/>\nnormally online during my playing hours (I live in EU) is very nice. Places like<br/>\nUnrest is rather crowded, but when I move to places like Cazic, Rathe mountains,<br/>\nPerma, MM. There is plenty of room. I did however try Rathe mountains this<br/>\nweekend and it was awfull. Like 3 groups camping (ouch I hate that word) Giant<br/>\nskellies and clops&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it all boils down to in my oppinion:<br/>\nAt 46-50th level Crowding is a problem because there is few places to hunt and<br/>\nthe number of high level players online is more &quot;constant&quot; than when it comes to<br/>\nlower level players.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt midlevels (me 29th level) Crowding is also a big problem during peek hours,<br/>\nnot so much because there is few zones to hunt in, but rather because of the<br/>\nsheer number of people online.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Verant needs to do something about both problems.<br/>\nMore servers, maybe serversplits to help on the crowding during peek hours and<br/>\nmaybe new zones to spread people out some more.<br/>\nQuests and other things geared towards 46+ players to keep those players from<br/>\ngetting the feeling of &quot;winnning&quot; the game (I bet the expansion will have a lot<br/>\nof nice things for 46+ players to do).<br/>\n<br/>\nWell that was my 2cp.<br/>\nMusiker Silverdrum, Woodelf bard of the 29th song, Bertoxoullus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 7<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 26 Jan 2000 00:39:08 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh only 200 50.  The diffrence is these 50&#39;s are not the average player we<br/>\nare all huge addicts and play a good 10 hours a day usually. So maybe you<br/>\nshould rethink that. Ok how many 49&#39;s? About 200 again. How many 48&#39;s about<br/>\n300. How many 47&#39;s ? About 300 and so and so on. How many 46+ zones ? The<br/>\nplanes and I guess lower guk and sol b but they have level 30&#39;s in them and<br/>\nit&#39;s crowded in with the high levels. You also have kedge keep but the<br/>\nspawns in there is like 4-6 hours on most mobs so 2 good groups can go in<br/>\nand clear the spawns and leave. So you got sol b, lower guk, and the 3<br/>\nplanes. Now even when we did all the planes that&#39;s about 30-40 in each<br/>\nplane. That&#39;s not even 10% of the 46+ people online. The dragons are a long<br/>\nspawn so they get done quickly and fire giants are a 8 hour spawn to. So you<br/>\ngot all these 46+ people who play a good 10 hours at the least usually 5<br/>\nhours a day. So why do you think were ocmplaining now?<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
