Our guild bard wanted to duel my<br/>\n&gt;druid while we were standing around last week after the patch and he<br/>\n&gt;basically locked me up with pixie strike.

It used to not have the MR reduction effect.  <br/>\nWhen it was a straight mez/stun song it was much more effective.  The MR <br/>\ndebuff introduced the dreaded double save.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
