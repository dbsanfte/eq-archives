Before the torrid flames come roaring in, hear me out.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, it makes sense, we sing a little song, people pay to hear it. <br/>\nThis is a normal thing.  I find if odd that bards have no real ability<br/>\nthat PC&#39;s will pay for (like most casters do).<br/>\n<br/>\nMake it a long recycle time, like beg. It needs to be resung (so you<br/>\ncant leave it on all night).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe money you make (like most of our songs) is based on CHA/faction and<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes sense, would help out and could lead to some better stuff.<br/>\nIf they decide to make a defining bard quest (liek soulfire for the<br/>\npaladin), perhaps a drum that is a decent 1HB weapon (Tom Toms of<br/>\nTerror), then the quest could be kicked off by performing the Money Song<br/>\nfor a certain NPC.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother cool thing would be to give us a cool animation for this, thus<br/>\nmaybe even some PC&#39;s with money to waste will pay to see it :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
