I&#39;ve lately taken to playing in groups on the weekends<br/>\nand soloing in the mornings during the week.  I have soloed (and easily I<br/>\nmight add) through 54, where I am now.  At one point I was a twink with<br/>\noverpowered equip but I dont think thats true anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\n51-54 I&#39;ve been in Burningwood :) Its very nice here.. fear kiting or dot<br/>\nkiting, its up to you :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana/Tani<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Christopher Sanders [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christopher.sanders@...\">christopher.sanders@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 24, 2001 6:43 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Seems to me, we solo well for certain level ranges.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First, the early levels.  Next would be our first charm song. <br/>\n&gt;  Next would be<br/>\n&gt; where I am now.  39, and I can solo  nearly any blue or black, with<br/>\n&gt; patience, using chains and my 2 chants, with drums equipped.  <br/>\n&gt; Which is nice<br/>\n&gt; when you get an add.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In GD, it&#39;s sometimes hard to find a group, so it&#39;s nice to <br/>\n&gt; once again have<br/>\n&gt; the option of soloing until I can get one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Atonal<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS - Our SK&#39;s tank Velketor.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Blitz Krieg [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 23, 2001 8:05 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m in total agreement.  I can&#39;t speak for solo play, but in <br/>\n&gt; group play we<br/>\n&gt; simply kick ass.  Even on raids, with the right guild that <br/>\n&gt; knows how to use<br/>\n&gt; us, we&#39;re no slouches.  Thott throws out a lot of numbers <br/>\n&gt; about how we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; scale well as we level, but somehow his analysis doesn&#39;t mirror my<br/>\n&gt; experiences on a daily basis.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hopefully VI is just looking at &quot;stacking issues&quot; and not <br/>\n&gt; anything more<br/>\n&gt; grand. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Darkfox<br/>\n&gt; Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Ugh....<br/>\n&gt;   Its funny... the more I play my bard and the higher she gets, I find<br/>\n&gt; myself<br/>\n&gt;   sometimes not telling people everything I can do, kind of <br/>\n&gt; keeping a low<br/>\n&gt;   profile, hoping that they don&#39;t notice.  Seriously, don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; laugh, its just<br/>\n&gt;   that bards seem very overpowered to me at higher levels, <br/>\n&gt; then again 60<br/>\n&gt;   shaman with Can IV....  I used to think all level 60 were <br/>\n&gt; equally powerful<br/>\n&gt;   but I&#39;m changing my thoughts.
