Druid<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason they wanted to group in the dreadlands (3 of these were<br/>\nguildies and the 4th was a friend).  I said we&#39;re probably over matched<br/>\nthere and won&#39;t do very well.  But they wanted to try it, so I agreed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decide to go full DOT mode since I figured our only shot was to kill these<br/>\nsuckers fast. (and I wanted to see if my damage calculations were close to<br/>\ncorrect).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat came as a total shock to me was that the ranger (augmented/buffed,<br/>\nwielding a yak and some weird spear/staff which he says is better off hand<br/>\nweapon than yak) was unable to keep the monsters from agroing on me.  I sung<br/>\n2 chants and Denon&#39;s using Nostrolo Tamborine and a normal horn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas it possible that I was outdamaging him?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was then I am pretty excited about this song combo.  Granted I can&#39;t<br/>\nuse Denon&#39;s in a dungeon (AOE damage bad!), but that could be replaced with<br/>\nan number of songs (I often use Melodic Binding in a multi pull dungeon<br/>\nsituation, the enchanters are quite grateful when the mobs that break mez<br/>\ncome running for me rather than them).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case with those 4 (low level for dreadlands) people we were able to<br/>\npull pretty much non stop, with the Ranger pulling anything but Ravishing<br/>\nDrolvogs (Those football players hit HARD).  Needless to say the xp was<br/>\namazing (for an outdoor pull), I got like 1.5 of 39 in about 2 hours...  I<br/>\nhavent seen xp like that since I was doing the lvl 18-2? solo DOT attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course at the end (&quot;last pull for me guys!&quot;) the new dragon was trained<br/>\nto Karnor&#39;s and I got killed in his breath weapon (while getting a screen<br/>\nshot!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
