Well, I have a dream - a dream of making a<br/>\ngame like what *I* think folks want to play - and I keep my ears open to<br/>\nlessons learned elsewhere - I digress again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what needs to be done about training IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonster latches onto target and does not switch unless attacked. If<br/>\nacquired target is lost - they pop back to spawn point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would end the practice of training as antisocial behavior. It might<br/>\nalso end kiting, if you get so far away from the MOB, perhaps make it so<br/>\nyou can outrun them - but have to be closer than most try to do it. Let<br/>\nkiters continue their tactics - but if they find all of a sudden that if<br/>\nthey outdistance the MOB they all of a sudden have to turn around and go<br/>\nback to the spawn point - I think you&#39;ll see this behavior modified to some<br/>\nextent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would also make it quite interesting for campers back at the spawn<br/>\npoint - no need for a ubermonster to spawn to clear camp sites - would<br/>\ncertainly make it a bit more challenging to just sit on your butt and camp<br/>\na site with folks pulling it clear constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant went a long way to prevent antisocial behavior - one reason I<br/>\nstarted EQ in the first place. Now, they need to observe and figure out<br/>\nwhat other ways pinheads insist on being jerks - and address those if<br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, purposeful training is right at the top of the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis change would also help bards - if not everyone they pass is added to<br/>\nthe shitlist - perhaps it would help with that problem too.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my .02.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I personally still don&#39;t see kiting as a<br/>\n&gt;major problem. Someone pointed out that<br/>\n&gt;some people create really bad trains while<br/>\n&gt;kiting.. Fixing kiting isn&#39;t going to fix<br/>\n&gt;this. On Veeshan, people train Spectre&#39;s for<br/>\n&gt;fun just to see how many people die. And<br/>\n&gt;then they shout &quot;how many lamers died that<br/>\n&gt;time? hahaha&quot;. Of course, GM&#39;s on Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;are non-existant so what the heck? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
