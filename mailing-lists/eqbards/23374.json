I would say 50 is<br/>\ntoo low.  Get 51 before emabarking on what is going to be a long career in<br/>\nthese places. You won&#39;t have those resists.  Yes, you can go there and yes,<br/>\nyou can do some stuff but don&#39;t be surprized if others are picked to join<br/>\ngroups before you.  It has nothing to do with player skill, very little to<br/>\ndo with class specific issues.  It&#39;s purely a level thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cyr, Thierry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thierry.cyr@...\">thierry.cyr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 23, 2001 10:33 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] OT Complete heal (was Numbers on Bards)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nno kidding, like me yesterday was getting wailed by a cleric that i wasnt<br/>\nhigh enough to be in karnors. Yet i was outdamaging the tanks (or<br/>\novertaunting).  To me that means that maybe i wasnt too low to be there,<br/>\nafter all i was crowd control as well and other then a bad streak of resists<br/>\ncompared to usual i was doing just fine...
