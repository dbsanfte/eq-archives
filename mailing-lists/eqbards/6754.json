I&#39;ve always said clerics are a bard&#39;s best friend. At least you<br/>\nhave noticed that. This is why I find it so frustrating that I can&#39;t<br/>\npull a mob off the cleric anymore. And it&#39;s worse without a cleric. I<br/>\ngot the itch to play again last week so I logged in and ended up in a<br/>\nparty with 2 rangers, a warrior and wizard deep in Sol B hunting bats.<br/>\nGot 3 bats in one pull than the extra 2 decided to beat on me. I got<br/>\nreal low and no one could get them off, then of course when I was at a<br/>\nbubble the third frenzied on me too and down I went. Then, after I found<br/>\na friendly cleric to res me, a lava duct crawler showed up just as she<br/>\ncast the res spell, so I reappeared, under the influence of the new<br/>\nresurrect effect, and it immediately dotted me with it&#39;s blood boil<br/>\ndispite being in combat with others.  And, before she could med up<br/>\nenough mana for another res my second corpse disappeared as it was<br/>\nempty. Sigh. A full bubble out of 49 down the tubes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
