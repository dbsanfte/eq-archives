And it doesn&#39;t seem to slow the mob&#39;s movement speed<br/>\nthat much until the mob is low on hp. It can help keep a very fast mob<br/>\nfrom rushing back and forth to your casters and healers but other than<br/>\nthat it really doesn&#39;t seem that useful in the early phase of combat.<br/>\nLater and for nailing down runners it&#39;s very effective though so I<br/>\nalways have it memorized. It can combine well with Screech to chase off<br/>\nsome mobs while keeping one slowly running away while you attack it but<br/>\nthis is only useful in limited situations (do not ever play fear in<br/>\nlower guk for instance &lt;g&gt;) Now that it&#39;s working, I&#39;ve been using chant<br/>\nof flame a bit to see how effective it is. As most of the powerful<br/>\nL39-40 wizard spells are ice based it&#39;s not as useful as chant of cold<br/>\nwill be, but if you have a druid in the party it is nice. From what I<br/>\ncan tell from testing on myself it seems to do DoT of about 30 as well<br/>\nas lowering fire resist significantly. I&#39;m hoping they fixed the L30<br/>\nsong soon so I can see how well that works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
