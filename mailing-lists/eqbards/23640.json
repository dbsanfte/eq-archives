For me, it happened when I got some vambraces off Ragefire.<br/>\nThey&#39;re too ugly to wear despite incredible stats, but they cast a<br/>\ntargetable 9 point damage shield (instant right click cast, like jboots),<br/>\nthat stacks with psalm of cooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I wasn&#39;t really willing to sing a song for a 9 point shield, I became<br/>\nwilling to sing it for an 18 point one.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaelrei<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve always had a problem with our damage shields actually.

There&#39;s almost<br/>\n&gt; always a better song to play than a damage shield, heck there probably<br/>\n&gt; always is a better song unless you&#39;re just wading thru greenies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 29, 2001 2:26 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Soloing bards<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I dont know if I would pick those songs (what level bard? depends on what<br/>\n&gt; choices were available) but they are not that far off base:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chains: good snare and atk slow down<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fufil&#39;s not only does some targeted damage but it also reduces the mob&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>MR<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (if anything, lead with Fufils so next thing sticks better.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Psalm of cooling: it gets awful hot and sweaty in Lower Guk and the damage<br/>\n&gt; shield also helps - especially if more than on mob is awake.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a thought,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Matt DeBarger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 29, 2001 11:12 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Soloing bards<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heh with my cleric (who normally plays only in his regular group, but with<br/>\n&gt; my play I have missed several sessions and need to catch up), I was<br/>\n </span></blockquote>gfrouped<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with a monk and a bard in L Guk (&quot;How long could it take for us to tfind a<br/>\n&gt; tank, lets get the ass sup camp while we wait&quot;).
