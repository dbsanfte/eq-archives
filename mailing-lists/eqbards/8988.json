Only recently have I not<br/>\nbeen the center of a single mobs attack. ( if there are multi-mobs, they<br/>\ncome after either me,the cleric, or the enchanter).  I&#39;m level 24 and now<br/>\nmost of the melee types are doing far more damage than me, and so the mobs<br/>\nleaves me alone, or the casters do far more damage than me, and they leave<br/>\nme alone.  Pre-level 20, I was doing somewhat less damage than pallies,<br/>\nmonks, warriors, yet the mobs would stick to me like glue. Of course part of<br/>\nthis is as a bard, I was usually relegated to pulling duty also, so I was<br/>\ntops on their hate list before battle started, but it would often happen<br/>\nregardless of whether I pulled or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBien <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:galen@...\">galen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 22, 1999 10:18 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Bard Hate...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:galen@...\">galen@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have been hearing rumors that &quot;bard hate&quot; does not really exist...<br/>\n&gt; Anyone actually have proof that it does?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
