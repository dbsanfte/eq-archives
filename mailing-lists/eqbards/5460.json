I agree<br/>\nthat 200pp is not something you make in a night at my level, but who<br/>\ncounts, Currently my belongings consist of:<br/>\n- 100pp (could have been more like 200 if I dident borrow money to everyone<br/>\nwho asks and wasent fooling around with baking)<br/>\n- Combine scimitar (my first magical weapon bought from gypsies and still<br/>\nin use)<br/>\n- Dragoon dirk (Travelled to CB and bought one before they went Lore)<br/>\n- Bloodstained mantle (helped a Highlevel char with corpse retriveal..<br/>\nDident expect this WOW)<br/>\n- Full set of banded/ringmail (I think bronze is too damned heavy)<br/>\n- Couple of dervrings and Onyx rings<br/>\n- Complete set of leather in the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know its not any fiery avenger like magic items, but I think my<br/>\nequipment is allright for my level =). I am in no rush making big money or<br/>\nbuying the latest greatest stuff published on EQlizer. Some (if not all) of<br/>\nmy caster friends are quite poor. Mostly because they spend alot of thier<br/>\nmoney on spells. Also some of my non caster friends are poor as hell, but<br/>\nthats mostly because they buy alot of magic stuff.<br/>\nOhh btw. I make around 5-10pp in a 2-3hours session - If its money I was<br/>\nafter I think I could boots that 10-15pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker 19th level woodelf bard Bertoxxoulus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> on 23-08-99 19:47:08<br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\ncc:    (bcc: Henrik Holm/HHO/Bang & Olufsen/DK)<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject:  [eqbards] Digest Number 282<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 7<br/>\n   Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1999 10:47:32 -0700<br/>\n   From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: EQ plat was: Elf Hide gloves...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the late post.  I have been on vacation.<br/>\nI hate checking my mail on vacation.  I like playing EQ tho.<br/>\n<br/>\nTopic was why did Harmonic chide Sylly for 50pp and Estella<br/>\nfor 75pp for elfhide gloves.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) When you are level 19 (which I was) you don&#39;t just throw<br/>\n   out 50pp or more on something like that.  Hell, you are<br/>\n   lucky to make 25pp on a hard working night.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) People who claim that plat is worthless, and that making<br/>\n   a couple hundred pp is no big deal are full of it.  That&#39;s<br/>\n   that traditional level 35+ person talking.  Refer to earlier<br/>\n   comment on my level at the time.  You don&#39;t make that much<br/>\n   money if you are a lower level adventurer.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I&#39;ve seen those gloves sell for 35pp to 45pp, in fact people<br/>\n   are willing to hand those gloves out at no cost sometimes!<br/>\n   I like to deal the price down on anything I buy, I don&#39;t just<br/>\n   throw plat at people for good items.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said, I bought elfhide gloves from a friend of mine last<br/>\nweek for 75pp.  She needed the money, and you know what?  I had<br/>\nthe money.  For once in my poor EQ career, I was starting to earn<br/>\nmoney.  Anyone under level 25 can appreciate that... you won&#39;t<br/>\nmake money until you are around level 30 or so.  All the people<br/>\nwho claim to make mad money are all over level 25 - there is no<br/>\ntrick to it.  Level = Money.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also bought two star ruby golden rings (300pp total - killer deal)<br/>\nYes, because I had the money.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t play me off as some cheap bastard like I was 11 levels ago,<br/>\nwhen I was lucky to make 10pp a night.  I&#39;m pulling down around<br/>\n50pp a night or so and I&#39;m happy as a clam to spend my money. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 30th drummer.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n____<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n____</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
