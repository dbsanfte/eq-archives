They&#39;ve been trying to<br/>\ntrack down cheaters and keep their &quot;customers&quot; from ruining the game, like<br/>\npeople did with Diablo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing worse than hunting around in a dungeon with some friends and<br/>\nhaving some person with a hacked up &quot;god&quot; mode come and in waste everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be more annoyed at Verant if they continued to allow an obvious exploit<br/>\nlike this. Granted, there could be a more elegant way of solving the problem<br/>\n(as suggested by John Kim), but the simplest way to fix a problem (probably<br/>\njust a minute data change) will probably also be the least likely to create<br/>\na bug in the process, which will probably cause some huge disruption to some<br/>\nsong that we (as bards) never use and will cause a huge uproar (how dare<br/>\nthey nerf our Disenchanting Melody! Don&#39;t they test this stuff!) and will<br/>\nrequire numerous emails, tests, verifications, and quantifications of the<br/>\nverifications from our resident experts to escalate the problem on the bug<br/>\nboards to get it fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, that last part went a little far, but you get the point. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf Mistsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
