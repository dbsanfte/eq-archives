This worked really well, and my party was super<br/>\nreceptive to my suggestions after I proved we could kick butt.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;m sneaking around the Mansion while invis, I will first of all call out<br/>\nwhat it is I&#39;m pulling.  (usually :)  The I call the prime target... for<br/>\nexample<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:\t\tI have a Ghoul and 2 Dark Boned Skelies... ready?<br/>\nCleric:\tI&#39;m ready<br/>\nRanger:\tReady<br/>\nEnchanter:\tok.<br/>\nMe:\t\tINC.... GHOUL FIRST.....<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter making this announcement, I switch from Invis to Weapons and<br/>\nSelos...drag em back.  I did on several occasions use Lullabye with lute, if<br/>\nI pulled too many.  And because we were already hitting one mob, the Lull<br/>\nworked great.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed a lot of players around my level get really discouraged in<br/>\nUnrest because of the tendency to train large groups.  Last night I changed<br/>\nseveral of thier minds, no one died once.<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin 19th Human Bard<br/>\non Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone needs to /assist the puller&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not switch targets unless I say&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not use AOE effects or spells&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not DoT the mob you arent fighting&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for the cursing, but this sort of advice is generally greeted with<br/>\n&gt; a &quot;Fuck you.  Check this bossy bard out...  Don&#39;t tell me how to play my<br/>\n&gt; character.&quot;, usually from a warrior or a necromancer (often Dark Elves for<br/>\n&gt; some reason).  I implore my group to let me lullaby mobs and yet they<br/>\n&gt; continue to, fight after fight, attack multiples.  Even if I stand there<br/>\n&gt; and lull, lull, lull shouting &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;fight one&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;fight one&quot; they just won&#39;t do it.  This isn&#39;t just one group, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; probably 8 out of 10. It&#39;s discouraging. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
