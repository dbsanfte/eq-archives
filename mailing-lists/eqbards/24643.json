You&#39;ll also<br/>\nget some spell drops - and it&#39;s a great way to work on Kromref (sp?)<br/>\nfaction - to be able to bank and buy food in Kael.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what the minimum level to fight there would be - 41 may be a<br/>\ntad low - I would expect by mid 40&#39;s you&#39;d get great loot and items.  But<br/>\nyou won&#39;t be able to take along anyone who wants Dragon faction<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 08, 2001 6:13 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Skyshrine and armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBeen grouping in Skyshrine with some higher level friends -- the dropped<br/>\narmor there totally rocks -- and a full set of it will take your resists<br/>\nright off the charts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a 52 druid there soloing to twink his 23 warrior.
