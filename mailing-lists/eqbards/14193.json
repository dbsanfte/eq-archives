I thought the same thing when I<br/>\nfirst heard the sound effects too (the music is pretty good<br/>\ntoo with a wavetable soundcard).  Then last week I bought a<br/>\nset of profession studio monitor headphones for a keyboard I&#39;m<br/>\nbuying.  Plugged it into the computer, played EQ - the sounds<br/>\nwere so obviously fake :) that within 5 minutes I&#39;d gone back<br/>\nto the speakers (they muffle the sound enough to where the<br/>\nfakeness isn&#39;t so obvious).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sound effects are really good, but there&#39;s still a lot of<br/>\nroom for improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
