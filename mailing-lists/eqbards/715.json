I was singing one<br/>\nof my songs when the whips life draining effect went off.  At that<br/>\nmoment, my spell slots un-grayed so it looked like I wasn&#39;t singing<br/>\nanymore, but my song effect still was in place and continued.  Trying<br/>\nto sing a new song resulted in it saying the song stopped, but the<br/>\noriginal song going when the weapon effect went off was still in<br/>\nplace.  Zoning or logging is the only way to get your songs back on<br/>\ntrack.  I did report this up using /bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nTigsen<br/>\n11th level bard on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n--- jay schultze &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;jay schultze&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I can confirm this one. Also, bard songs have some special &quot;Side<br/>\n&gt; Effects&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;times.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Some of these can be useful, some can be lethal. For example:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Root - While playing the Accelerando, root and similar spells that<br/>\n&gt; generate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the &quot;BOOT&quot; icon will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;             have no effect on you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I seem to remember that WHILE playing Accelerando it was possible<br/>\n&gt; for me to <br/>\n&gt; be rooted, BUT i could cancel the effect by stopping and restarting<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; song. I don&#39;t recall it ever making you immune to root. Correct if<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; wrong! =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another thing I found (to my dismay):  I was really excited when I<br/>\n&gt; got my <br/>\n&gt; Screaming Mace. I know a bard using blunt weapons may sound<br/>\n&gt; strange, but if <br/>\n&gt; you look at the stats the Screamer is like a magical mino axe -<br/>\n&gt; same dmg, <br/>\n&gt; same speed, hits magical, and BONUS random Strength from it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Scream/Yaulp <br/>\n&gt; (I really liked this because you could stack it on top of EVERY<br/>\n&gt; other Str <br/>\n&gt; buff - I had like STR 175 or something with a shaman buffing me, my<br/>\n&gt; strength <br/>\n&gt; songs, some magic items, and the Scream).<br/>\n&gt; Well - it all sounds good, but I found that the Screamer causes<br/>\n&gt; your songs <br/>\n&gt; to go out of wack. When the Scream is in effect you can&#39;t sing. You<br/>\n&gt; start a <br/>\n&gt; song and it immediately ends with no effect. So I had to get rid of<br/>\n&gt; my mace <br/>\n&gt; (sigh).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll post if I find that any other items cause this effect. Also<br/>\n&gt; would <br/>\n&gt; appreciate if any other bards have experienced anything like this<br/>\n&gt; with other <br/>\n&gt; magical items - it would be nice to post. It was rather irritating<br/>\n&gt; to find <br/>\n&gt; this out after getting all the required components for the mace<br/>\n&gt; (what a damn <br/>\n&gt; annoying quest).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sartori of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
