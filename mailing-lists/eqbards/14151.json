A tank told me last week he hates when bards<br/>\nuse this, because it kills Ultravision, whether it be the spell or the<br/>\nguise effect (he is a 50 warrior with a guise of the deceiver). I forgot<br/>\nto check this, and he wasn&#39;t 100% sure which song it was. He simply said<br/>\n&quot;the song that puts up the wimpy damage shield that&#39;s a cold resist<br/>\nbuff&quot; ;P. I&#39;ve noted a large number of bards like to play this song for<br/>\nthe damage shield in the L30s range. Perhaps if you are doihng so, this<br/>\nis the cause of your problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
