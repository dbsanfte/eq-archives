Quit laughing and<br/>\nhear me out.  First you would target the live player and use Lyssa&#39;s<br/>\nLocating Lyric to target his corpse regardless of where it is in the zone.<br/>\nThen you would play this song and summon yourself (*squisha*) to that<br/>\ncorpse.  The catch is that this song would be only a trinket though unless<br/>\nVerant added the feature that this *one song* did not cancel Invis or Invis<br/>\nvs. Undead.  This would give us a similar ability to Necros with much more<br/>\ndanger to the bard (Verant would like that), plus it would be useless in<br/>\nsome high level dungeons and the Planes where everything can see you<br/>\nregardless.  This, therefore, would not lessen the need for a Necro in those<br/>\nreally sticky situations like Planes and Dragon corpse retrievals.<br/>\n<br/>\n[46 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Nah - it&#39;s gotta be Bardic (and with those undead Bards in Paineel, this<br/>\n&gt; would be perfect ;)<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Talies&#39; Dance of the Dead - targetted corpse, if within range<br/>\n&gt; (limited to<br/>\n&gt; about 100 feet or so, of course) gets up and walks to it&#39;s owner (Owner<br/>\n&gt; must be within &quot;heal&quot; range of the Bard)&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This would be great for lava and &quot;stuck in the wall&quot; retrievals,<br/>\n&gt; but not as<br/>\n&gt; powerful as the Necro summoning. Additionally, Necros could get this as a<br/>\n&gt; spell at a lower level, giving them a little more power, too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a thought...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talies the Wanna-be-a-Necro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
