Running a guild has its expenses, especially if we are to<br/>\nprovide collective services for our bards so that they might carry on their<br/>\nwork with honor and dignity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I mentioned to you before, lad, we provide the following services to our<br/>\nmembers:<br/>\n    * Patchwork armor for all new students<br/>\n    * The first five levels of songs for all new students<br/>\n    * A hand drum at level 5<br/>\n    * A lute at level 8<br/>\n    * Bi-weekly rewards for the best in-guild ballad or writing. This week<br/>\n       it was a Banded mail tunic.<br/>\n    <br/>\nAlso, we use the money to pay for other expenses, including:<br/>\n     * Staff for concerts<br/>\n     * Saving for a guild hall<br/>\n     * Prizes for other Soerbaird events<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not use guild money for:<br/>\n     * Buying better armor or equipment for guild leadership<br/>\n     * Bribing news sites for better placement<br/>\n     * Paying necromancers to destory anyone who speaks negatively<br/>\n       about The Soerbaird<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the public record, all of our staff, called Ollave, have more than paid<br/>\ntheir ten platinum, without a complaint, and most of them continue to<br/>\ncontribute into the guild treasury on a daily basis, in order to benefit<br/>\nour students. I have seen several of them give the shirts off of their<br/>\nbacks and the weapons from their fists to help a deserved student in need.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoerbaird, before you sally our guild&#39;s reputation again in a public forum,<br/>\nI would respectfully request that you air your differences with me, as I<br/>\nwill be happy to hear any problem you have with our guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nListen and Live.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Jythri, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Joe Racke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joe_racke@...\">joe_racke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is it just me or is Soerbairds guild a rip off....I really want to know<br/>\n&gt;why the heck it costs 10plat plus a monthly fee to join...thats a load<br/>\n&gt;of Bull crap.....I was going to join but then i found i had better<br/>\n&gt;things to do than pay to those greedy rogues....If you give me enough<br/>\n&gt;information on that guild and why it costs so much then i might join it<br/>\n&gt;until then.....keep begging Soerbairds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is Ralborn Songbearer ending his song<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ralborn<br/>\n&gt;Bard of Qeynos<br/>\n&gt;follower of Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt;(also in his world) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
