When you add one","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-654397283\">I heard about how the Attack rating works a long time ago when it was<br/>\ndiscovered stats don&#39;t affect gameplay as much as everyone thought.  When<br/>\nyou add one point of STR, your Attack score raises by one as well.  Makes<br/>\nsense since part of the Attack score determines how much damage you do.<br/>\nLogically, adding one point of DEX should also raise the Attack score by<br/>\none.  This should get applied to the To Hit portion of the Attack rating.<br/>\nSadly it doesn&#39;t for a reason known only to Verant.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNever heard that AC worked in a similar manner until now.  Would like to<br/>\nknow which components of AC affect Hit Avoidance and which affect Damage<br/>\nMitigation.  I would assume your Defense stat and your Agility affect Hit<br/>\nAvoidance and the AC from your armor affects Damage Mitigation.  What<br/>\nhappens when you get an AC buff from spells/songs?  Does the extra AC all go<br/>\nto Hit Avoidance, Damage Mitigation, or split equally between the two?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 06, 2001 12:29 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: How AC works (was:RE: [eqbards] Largos Absonant Binding (lvl<br/>\n51))<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AC number you see on your screen is not the number the game uses for<br/>\ncombat.  It is a composite number made up of two parts.  One part is Hit<br/>\nAvoidance, this effects how often you are actually hit.  The other is Damage<br/>\nMitigation, this effects how much damage you take when you get hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttack works the same way.  It is made up of a To Hit portion and a Damage<br/>\nportion.  The numbers were both shown in beta for awhile, but where taken<br/>\nout because they were &#39;to confusing&#39; and replace with the misleading<br/>\ncomposite numbers we see today.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jamie R.

Take off a piece of <br/>\n&gt; armor with 10 AC and no agi bonuses and you might like 20+ <br/>\n&gt; AC.  So if I reduces your &quot;raw&quot; AC by 16, that could be a <br/>\n&gt; large &quot;calculated&quot; AC decrease.
