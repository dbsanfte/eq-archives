Only group to break that<br/>\n&gt;   post patch on Innoruuk.  We cleared the path to Maestro, which is<br/>\n&gt;   about 6 houses or so and the south patrol, however a bugged spite golem<br/>\n&gt;   prevented further advancement.  Apparently this golem had it&#39;s pet<br/>\n&gt;   trapped in the NE corner.  The golem also blocked the path to clear<br/>\n&gt;   anymore, and when pulled it we got 15 mobs.  I played fear and counted<br/>\n&gt;   the Screech messages just to see how many were there.  All resisted fear<br/>\n&gt;   too, 15 of them.  In the 6 hours we were there, one WAR arms dropped.<br/>\n&gt;   That is unacceptible.  But I expected as much from Verant.  The planes<br/>\n&gt;   and dragons are a big deathtrap now due to bugs and impossible upgrades.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you (the experienced plane and dragon people) are having problems<br/>\nwith them, how do you think we (the young still impressed by watching a<br/>\nsand giant dying people) feel?  By the time I get to lvl 47 (My estimate<br/>\nis July of 2005 now) how impossible will it be?  (Not to mention, by<br/>\nthen a lvl 100 Necro&#39;s Pet will probably be able to solo Vox).  Its<br/>\nsomething thats kind of put a damper on some of our adventuring now that<br/>\nwe see no long term furute for our group...<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
