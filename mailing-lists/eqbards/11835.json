From what I have read on the groups most of the dueling<br/>\nresults have been for extremely high level people like Shada and a few<br/>\nlower level duels.  What I am looking for is some sort of tactics to be<br/>\nused in the battle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease understand that the ranger I will be facing will be wielding many<br/>\nitems that are above her level like Raincaller, Short Sword of Morin, and<br/>\nThulian Bladed Claw.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso some thoughts... am I expected to lose?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nBard of Kelethin, Honour Guard <br/>\nKarana<br/>\nTo be married to well equipped ranger in less than a month.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
