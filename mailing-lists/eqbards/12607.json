In an excerpt<br/>\nfrom the test server:<br/>\n<br/>\nSolution: <br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets<br/>\nsuicide and the charmed ones break Charm.  We do not want, however, to<br/>\nadversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree.  What we<br/>\ndo recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necros from exploiting key<br/>\nspawn points.  Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately<br/>\nbreak Charm.  However, summoned NPCs (pets) will not be affected.  While<br/>\nthis still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet,<br/>\nit does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that<br/>\ncharming an NPC does. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe would appreciate diligent testing of this change, to insure that no<br/>\nunforeseen problems have been caused by it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-The EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now they are saying they would appreciate diligent testing of a change?<br/>\nWtf?  Who is the customer and who is the service provider here?  I guess<br/>\nthis tells us everything we need to know about Verant test procedure.  Throw<br/>\nthe code out on the test server and hope some player puts it to task.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n\tmore disillusioned than ever</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
