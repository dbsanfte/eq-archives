Hopefully people will add to this.  This is for low to mid 20&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been to every zone except Solusek A and B, Kedge Keep and the Red<br/>\nDragon&#39;s Lair. This is what I have found...<br/>\n<br/>\nAll times are peak times on a weeknight.<br/>\n<br/>\nPermafrost: 18-22 people. Ok loot, but need a full party because you get<br/>\nswarmed. It is dangerous for low 20&#39;s because of this fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nCazic-Thule: 70+ people. Great loot, but even with a full party this place<br/>\nis hell on Norrath (unless you make straight for the bottom of the temple<br/>\nwith invis where the trains won&#39;t come). This has got to be Grand Central<br/>\nStation of Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnrest: 70+ people. Good loot, easy to work from edges and pull from inside.<br/>\nTrains are usually manageable (or you can get away if you have SoW).<br/>\n<br/>\nNajena: 15-20 people. Okay loot, easy in most areas. At low 20&#39;s keep away<br/>\nfrom the high camped areas (Najena, Drezlna, and Bonecrusher).<br/>\n<br/>\nMistmoore: 20-30 people. Great loot for the brave, but also death for the<br/>\nbrave too. At low 20&#39;s you should stick to the familiars outside and by the<br/>\ngraveyard. I made the mistake of investigating a tunnel. When I turned<br/>\naround and headed back to the zone I was backstabbed for 170 damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpper Guk: Good experience, good loot. Actually went here at high teens. The<br/>\ntrains can be deadly at times, and if you don&#39;t know the way to the zone its<br/>\npretty much a slow and agonizing death. Need a full group and someone that<br/>\ncan root (ensnare is even better as they don&#39;t fight back when they are<br/>\nensnared.) Never fight something if you don&#39;t have to without being full on<br/>\nmana and health. A simple kill can turn into a cluster*#&$@ very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some outside areas. The reason the loot isn&#39;t as good is because<br/>\nthe risk is not as great. SoW and accelerando works outdoors, and you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to worry about getting lost (too much).<br/>\n<br/>\nSouth Karana: Good experience, so-so loot. <br/>\n<br/>\nHigh Hold Pass: If you don&#39;t have a wizard in your group, forgot about it.<br/>\nThe general rule in High Hold is &#39;He who has the power gets the kill&#39;. There<br/>\nis no sharing here that I have seen. I usually avoid it except for an<br/>\noccasional gnoll getting in my way.<br/>\n<br/>\nEast Karana: Great for levels from 16-20. Creatures that poison and that<br/>\nrequire magic to hit give MORE experience than things that do not.<br/>\nSignificantly. Lower 20&#39;s you want two on one against Crag spiders. Ok loot.<br/>\nA group of 4 low 20&#39;s or 2 mid 20&#39;s can kill Broon the cyclops. No loot to<br/>\nspeak of but good experience and bragging rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverfrost Peaks: An occasional Snow Orc at this level is about the only<br/>\nthing you want for experience, and not much. Good money from other things<br/>\nthough....<br/>\n<br/>\nNektulous Forest: On this side of the bridge attack the guards (greens and<br/>\nyellows). If you see a Dragoon, don&#39;t ask questions just head for the zone.<br/>\nAlso not a good solo situation as the guards have a high range of visibility<br/>\nand they gang up on you. SoW is pretty much required if you don&#39;t want to<br/>\ndie.<br/>\n<br/>\nOcean of Tears: Investigate the islands. Good experience on most.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nCwelenas, Minstrel of the 7th Chord<br/>\n<br/>\nAngarth Bladedancer, Warrior of the 21th Tier<br/>\n&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
