Update synching between<br/>\nclient and server?  Of course jumping off the ramps in E Karana is not a<br/>\nrecommended method for escaping Mob&#39;s.  Another thing I noticed, Bellowing<br/>\nhelps as well.  That little bit it knocks them back has made the difference<br/>\nfor me a couple of times in Najena when I couldn&#39;t use accellerando and ran<br/>\nout of stamina for jumping.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 11, 1999 1:08 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Charming Methods<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 11 Nov 1999, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What, John made a mathematical error?
