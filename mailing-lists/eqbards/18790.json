Point<br/>\n&gt; is they are<br/>\n&gt; not, in fact they patently suck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Being able to Summon Food and Water is totally a joke.  It would be a joke<br/>\n&gt; if it were on armor I could get at 28th level.  At 50+ it&#39;s extremely<br/>\n&gt; insulting.  I&#39;m not sure how anyone could reasonably defend that it is<br/>\n&gt; really useful to have at 50+.  What do we have now, Verant<br/>\n&gt; clones?  Please.<br/>\n&gt; Why would characters who have been leaving behind 5pp weapons for<br/>\n&gt; 10+ levels<br/>\n&gt; because they were trash loot suddenly care about 6cp muffins and milk?<br/>\n&gt; Great, now we can save everyone in our party 1.2 sp a day, whoopee.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enduring Breath is minorly useful.  Is it anywhere near as useful<br/>\n&gt; as +25 STR<br/>\n&gt; or Invisibility is to a warrior?  No.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am more irritated by the overall combo than just the AC points.<br/>\n&gt;  It shows<br/>\n&gt; the usual lack of any kind of thought when it comes to the bard class.  We<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t a tank so we get lower armor.  How does this mesh with giving us a<br/>\n&gt; weapon that reduces our level on the hate list?  If we aren&#39;t a tank why<br/>\n&gt; should we need a weapon to reduce hate?  It certainly won&#39;t help if we<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t up there mixing it up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; snip &gt;I think some of us are losing sight of what the bard class<br/>\n&gt; is.
