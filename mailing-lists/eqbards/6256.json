Maybe I&#39;m incorrect in assuming<br/>\nthat the whole point of EverQuest is the experience of getting to level 50.<br/>\n There may be a few challenges left at level 50, but that&#39;s not really what<br/>\nthe game is all about.  Once you reach 50, I don&#39;t really see the point.<br/>\nYou&#39;ve won, essentially.  You&#39;ve become a demi-god, or whatever.  If it was<br/>\na single player game, it would be over.  Why should Verant have to generate<br/>\ncontent for those that have maximized their characters, beyond the few<br/>\nreally tough encounters that should be the ultimate victories for said<br/>\ncharacters?  Once you&#39;ve killed Nafagen, or Lady Vox, or other Uber-mob,<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t it be time to retire?  Obviously this stance would cause the<br/>\nlevel 50 people to stop playing, and move on to other games, but I think<br/>\nthat this is how it should be (unless they want to play as a different<br/>\ncharacter).  The VAST majority of players still haven&#39;t reached 50, and<br/>\nmost aren&#39;t even close.  Verant can&#39;t make the game revolve around<br/>\npowergamers, because they would never be able to keep up.  In fact, I&#39;m for<br/>\nputting level 50 characters into forced retirement until the expansion<br/>\npack.  That way we could get rid of all this farming for guilds, and for<br/>\nother twinked characters.  Plus we&#39;d stop distracting the developers from<br/>\nfixing the real problems with the game.  In my opinion, lack of things for<br/>\nlevel 50 players to do is not an important problem in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:19 PM 9/9/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;very true.  its all lower guk, sol B, or twinking characters like you said.<br/>\n&gt;had a lot of fun with Fire Giants a few nights one week though, all the way<br/>\n&gt;up to and including warlord skarlon.  got me the first mithril arms on the<br/>\n&gt;server =)  and then the Nagafen kill.  but pretty slow since then,<br/>\n&gt;definitely need a Fear repatch and Hate to open.  i know a lot of people not<br/>\n&gt;yet 50 are upset about fear too, as the 50s are crowding their space now =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shada<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Woohoo. Congrats. Since I started a full time job again recently I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; haven&#39;t been able to play long enough to be able to organise <br/>\n&gt;&gt; a party to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; even try. Also, when I do log in, seems like most of my friends are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; either playing second characters or out hunting lower level mobs to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; twink said characters. Since the last fear plane nerfing the amount of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; things for L50 chars to do is pretty dismal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How would you like to have a voice in the marketplace and be<br/>\n&gt;rewarded for it?
