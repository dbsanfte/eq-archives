The test results I sent in to GZ<br/>\ncovered both with and without lute.  The false resist percentage was nearly<br/>\nidentical, with lute yes being actually slightly higher.  I still think it<br/>\nacts like a bug in the resist routine.  I got about 70% the false resists<br/>\nwith low blues that I got with 1st-2nd level critters.  Could be a data<br/>\nspike but with 1500 tests on each category not too likely.  Seems the best<br/>\nanalog to fit the data I could come up with was still that the song has a<br/>\nminus to resist and when the modified resist comes up negative as a result<br/>\nthe critter doesn&#39;t resist (so no resist message) but the logic blows out<br/>\nbefore actually applying the effect to the mob due to getting an unhandled<br/>\nresist value.<br/>\n<br/>\nGZ sent me an email that he would definitely look at the test data I sent<br/>\nand follow up on it, but that with the holidays it might be a while.<br/>\nHopefully it won&#39;t get pushed aside and forgotten.  The test made it pretty<br/>\nclear that the song wasn&#39;t having the effect it should have.  Either the<br/>\nresist logic is totally screwed up and isn&#39;t reporting all resists (which<br/>\nmeans its actually resisted a lot) or there&#39;s a bug in the fails to resist<br/>\nlogic somewhere that&#39;s messing up the duration.  Either way we will<br/>\nhopefully get some info on it.  I know Baelish over at Caster&#39;s Realm sent<br/>\nin a query on it for us too and he&#39;s pretty tight with GZ.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 29, 1999 12:35 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Lullaby theory<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI read a post the other day on the Concert Hall that has since scrolled off<br/>\nso as a result I can&#39;t paste the full text into here.  Everything below is<br/>\nfrom memory so if someone else remembers the post correct me if I left<br/>\nsomething out or misstated the original posters comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original poster had a theory about the effect of equipping a lute while<br/>\nsinging lullaby.  Like other bards have commented, the poster had noticed<br/>\nthat mobs were still attacking him even though they did not resist the<br/>\nlullaby and should have been sleeping.  In one combat he decided not to<br/>\nequip the lute and instead just sang the lullaby.  He noticed that the mobs<br/>\nstopped attacking him while they were asleep.  The song appeared to work<br/>\nlike it was supposed to.  The poster then stated a theory that perhaps<br/>\nlullaby has two effects that mobs have a chance to resist, similar to DDD.<br/>\nWith DDD, you get the area of effect DOT plus the lowering of the mobs AC<br/>\neffect. If the mobs fails one resist but makes the other then the song gets<br/>\nfully resisted.  The posters theory was that lullaby had two effects and in<br/>\norder to get both of them to work you have to equip the lute.  Singing the<br/>\nsong only has one effect of putting the mob to sleep.  Mobs only get one<br/>\nresist check.  Singing the song while equipping a lute puts them to sleep<br/>\nplus nixes the hate list.  Mob gets two resist checks.  If the mob makes one<br/>\nthe song doesn&#39;t effect him.  In this case there is a bug that still gives<br/>\nyou the &quot;head nods&quot; message when you should get a resist message.    <br/>\n<br/>\nHaven&#39;t had the chance to test this for myself so I thought I would throw it<br/>\nout and see what everyone else thinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n29 bard<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
