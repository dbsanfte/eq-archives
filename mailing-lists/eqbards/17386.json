Casters gain virtually zero<br/>\nadvantage from using a FBSS.  Because of funny behavior of<br/>\nhaste items I just recently found, whereas other melee classes<br/>\nwould get a 20% haste out of it (unless grouped with a<br/>\nbard/enchanter), a bard your level will get a 46% haste out of<br/>\nit (20% Celerity -&gt; 75% max).  So arguably a bard would be<br/>\n*better* able to use the FBSS than anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou really have to discuss loot distribution with everyone<br/>\nbefore-hand and arrive at some sort of consensus.  Because<br/>\nbards are mediocre at everything, they typically end up<br/>\ngetting shafted on most of the high end item distributions.  <br/>\nYou have to make sure that, for example, if your friends are<br/>\ngoing to demote you on the EBW and FBSS lists, then they<br/>\nshould promote you on something else, like a Ykesha, to<br/>\nbalance things out.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
