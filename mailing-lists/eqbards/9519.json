I too am wearing a Grotesque mask and would like to loose it<br/>\nin favor of something better.  However, I still wear it in battle at this<br/>\npoint - I believe it&#39;s better than nothing in that slot.  A couple of items<br/>\noften suggested are the Guise of the Deciever and Platinum Star Ruby Veil.<br/>\nThe Guise is very nice with AC 4, CHA +13 and SV vs. Magic +7, and it gives<br/>\nunlimited charges of Illusion: Dark Elf, which can come in handy from time<br/>\nto time over and beyond befuddling newbies.  The Platinum Star Ruby Veil is<br/>\nCHA +9 and DEX +9, which is not bad either.  The Guise you have to get from<br/>\na dungeon yourself, while the veil can be made by a talented jeweler.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other face suggestions folks?<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 29th song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok I am curently useing a Grotesk mask. Its +7 dex and -7 cha I<br/>\n&gt; think. Well<br/>\n&gt; I have been told by 2 different people to lose the mask because for are<br/>\n&gt; lullaby song it will resist less if we have a high cha. Is this a<br/>\n&gt; total bull<br/>\n&gt; rumor or fact? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
