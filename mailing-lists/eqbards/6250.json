To those who dismiss effects like<br/>\nthe JBoots and SOW, I prize them greatly when I am corpse retrieving for<br/>\nmy party in Mistmoore.  Without SOW, I would be left at the standard run<br/>\nspeed which isn&#39;t useful when I am try to avoid the nasty trains started<br/>\nthere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is unfortunate that at this juncture, no major changes to the<br/>\nlooting system will be made.  The best suggestion that I have heard is to<br/>\nsimply flag items with a serial number that incorporates the item number<br/>\nand user id number.  For instance the Shiny Brass Shield is item number<br/>\n0200 and you are user 00000001 then the serial number for the shield would<br/>\nbe 020000000001.  If you ever try to loot another you will not be able to<br/>\npick it up and it will be left on the corpse.  This is by far the best<br/>\nsolution I have heard, no need for lore items, no need to worry about<br/>\nfarming and the ability to sell such items remains.  The only drawback is<br/>\nwhat happens when someone tricks you in a trade.  BTW if there are<br/>\ndestroyed the item serial number is removed from the database.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 9 Sep 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When the player-to-player trade (or twink) aspect of an RPG<br/>\n&gt; starts to interfere with the adventuring aspect, something is<br/>\n&gt; wrong.  After playing this game, I&#39;ve decided a &quot;shows up only<br/>\n&gt; a few times a day&quot; system is really stupid when a mob that&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; challenge to you is a pushover for someone else, and there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; no system to enforce taking turns.  I think a better system<br/>\n&gt; would be to allow each character to loot each special mob once<br/>\n&gt; in a lifetime, and put lower level looting limits on the mobs<br/>\n&gt; (to prevent the use of mules).  No more kill stealing for nice<br/>\n&gt; items, no more harvesting to trade/sell on EBay/twink, no more<br/>\n&gt; camping the same place for a week (and blocking out others) so<br/>\n&gt; your entire guild can be outfitted with the rare item, and no<br/>\n&gt; more having to wait 3 days for a rare mob to show up.  The<br/>\n&gt; &quot;rare&quot; mob could always be there, and rarity of an item could<br/>\n&gt; be determined by how frequently he drops the booby prize.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Believe me, as you get some of the nice continuous effect<br/>\n&gt; songs like invisibility or levitation, you will wish you had a<br/>\n&gt; pair of jboots.  My friends have started poking fun at me<br/>\n&gt; because I&#39;ve been asking for SoW a lot lately.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
