As soon as you zone into paineel you see a large pit<br/>\nthat if you fall into safely drops you back outside in tox for the time<br/>\nbeing. I would wager that when the hole is brought online, that pit IS the<br/>\nhole... i remember reading before that the hole sat underneath paineel.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
