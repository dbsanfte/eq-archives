The bard is a very<br/>\ncapable and enjoyable class to play even though I do believe that it is also<br/>\none of the more difficult.  As a brad you get to experience things from the<br/>\ncaster class as well as the melee classes. You will get to do many things.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery soon you will need a weapon that can damage magical creatures.  So save<br/>\nyour money and try to do things to make money.  You will need about 50pp to<br/>\n60pp to get either a Dragoon Dirk or a Combine Longsword.  By level 17, you<br/>\nshould have 2 magical weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, keep your piercing skills maxxed with a giant snake fang<br/>\nand your 1 hand slash maxxed with any good sword you can get in loot or<br/>\nperhaps from friends and if you can get a decent 1 hand blunt staff or club<br/>\nkeep that skill maxxed as well.  Also work on swimming.  If you dont already<br/>\nknow them, learn all the zones and the best ways to get around (and I dont<br/>\nmean /ooc Can anyone teleport me to GFay???&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have over 110 days played on my bard and she is still lots and lots of<br/>\nfun!  Bards are designed to be very valuable party members (and less so as a<br/>\npowerful solo class.) So, the more fun you can have with people and partys,<br/>\nthe more you will enjoy your bard.  But it will take alot of time and an<br/>\nenormous amount of dedication. And you will die, alot!  Hehe, so dont get<br/>\ndiscouraged and dont pay too much attention to the problems of other people.<br/>\nEnjoy your character and your class and all of the others in the game as<br/>\nwell.  While this game is not &quot;hard&quot; on the other hand it is not &quot;quick and<br/>\neasy&quot; either.   the more fun you can make on your own, the more you will<br/>\nenjoy things.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease keep us posted and ask any kinds of questions - we are always happy<br/>\nto answer.  (Also, check the faq and the bard web site for really good<br/>\ninformation. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a>  Enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 45 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jennifer McComb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mccomb@...\">mccomb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 11, 2000 1:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] New bard questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Jennifer McComb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mccomb@...\">mccomb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me introduce myself.  I&#39;m a new player to Everquest (received it for<br/>\n&gt; Christmas).  I&#39;ve played an Erudite paladin up to level 7, a Barbarian<br/>\n&gt; shamon up to level 9, and now I&#39;m a half elf bard at level 7.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I subscribed to this mailing list a few days ago and so far have just<br/>\n&gt; seen postings that talk about the higher levels.  I&#39;ve also noticed that<br/>\n&gt; many of the posts sound unsatisfied with the bard character.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At level 7, what should I be concentrating on now?  What items should I<br/>\n&gt; be pursuing in the near future?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you had it to over again, would you even pursue the bard route?  What<br/>\n&gt; makes the bard fun?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jerrilia - Bard of the 7th song.  (Luclin) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
