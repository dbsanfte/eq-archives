You can have a wizard burn the mob almost entirely to the ground and<br/>\nlull it once for it to attack you. I&#39;ve noticed though that once a mob is<br/>\nlulled, your hatedness by the creature is very low. If you don&#39;t do anything<br/>\nelse to it the next hit by someone else will draw it off.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 9:55 AM<br/>\n8)To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n8)Subject: Re: [eqbards] Area effect songs<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)On Wed, 2 Jun 1999, Rogers Pessin wrote:<br/>\n8)&gt;<br/>\n8)&gt; A question about the lullaby spell.
