It&#39;s not exactly a godly plate of the whale-<br/>\n&gt; actually, every one of my characters after the first have made at least a<br/>\n&gt; hundred pp by level 15 (fairly, I might add, without using any trade skills<br/>\n&gt; or even camping for lore items like everyone else), and some have gotten<br/>\n&gt; much more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is precisely why I&#39;d suggest keeping the crown. 250pp is NOT that<br/>\nmuch. You can make that cash if you really want it -- however a crown is<br/>\nworth a lot. As someone else said, it&#39;s on the border of being one of<br/>\nthose things that is only traded and not sold.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a rule of trading that I learned: Never trade a rare drop for a<br/>\ncommon drop. Yes, there are exceptions, but this almost always holds true.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if the common drop is from a monster 10 levels higher, it&#39;s usually<br/>\nnot worth it. Because there&#39;s almost always a surplus of common drops<br/>\nproduced whenever someone camps for a rare drop, meaning the value of the<br/>\nitem is much much lower.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, don&#39;t trade your crown (rare drop) for cash (which you&#39;d use to buy<br/>\ncommon things, like bronze and dragoon dirks).<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
