At first I<br/>\nthought Cannibalism to be inefficient, but after discovering this I found<br/>\ntiming the stand -&gt; cast -&gt; sit pattern between ticks, I could use both<br/>\neffectively (med and cann).<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe clarity (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus) puts a &quot;clarity counter&quot; on<br/>\neveryone in the group.  When the tick occurs, the counter is removed and<br/>\nadditional mana is granted to the holder.  This would explain why it is<br/>\npossible to weave one other song in addition to clarity without diluting<br/>\nit&#39;s effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about this topic because I don&#39;t like the common ideology<br/>\nof &quot;direct mana addition per pulse,&quot; when starting/stopping the song<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t add anything over simply singing it straight (despite the doubled<br/>\nnumber of pulses).  The big question, of course, is: Will the Cantata of<br/>\nReplenishment stack with the Chorus of Clarity?<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
