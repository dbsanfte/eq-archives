One of these items was the Grotesque Mask, which actually lowers your<br/>\ncharisma, giving you an indication as to how important he felt Dexterity was.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the level of the song relative to your own level is very important in<br/>\ndetermining how often you miss notes, as well as your skill with the<br/>\ninstrument.  The first time I tried to play Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord with my<br/>\nhorn, I missed about 20 notes in a row before I finally got the song going.  Now<br/>\nthat I am better in Brass and higher in level, I miss much less frequently.<br/>\nAlso, I missed much less often when I sang instead of using the horn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this answer definative?  No.  But I would be very very surprised if Charisma<br/>\nwas the determining factor rather than Dexterity.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrength is still THE most important bard stat though, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
