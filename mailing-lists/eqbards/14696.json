One beggar got me just as I entered Everfrost<br/>\nzone. He eventually begged from my partner as well. Seems he was going down<br/>\nthe entire list of people in the zone. This was no brand-new, clueless<br/>\nplayer begging for stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo keep this bard related, I did have a level 1 bard &quot;inspect&quot; me at the<br/>\nbank and then start begging stuff from me. I told him I&#39;d be happy to give<br/>\nhim any advice, but he started the &quot;please, please, please&quot; replies for<br/>\nequipment. He started giving me grief after I refused to give him equipment<br/>\nand I ended up &quot;ignoring&quot; him. In the future, I will not respond to any beg<br/>\nrequests, which is sad as I do like to help those who truly need the help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI give my older equipment to younger guild members, or sometimes to newbies<br/>\nwho are actually hunting and working hard. I&#39;ve always appreciated other<br/>\nplayers giving me stuff or buffing me when I&#39;m out there hacking away at<br/>\nrats with my new characters. I really loved it when a level 50 magician<br/>\nstarted casting lava shield on me as a level 5 druid. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m always happy to give advice or strategies and, of course, locating<br/>\ncorpses.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\nLevel 28 Bard, Bertox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
