Up until this point, when I want to buff resist rates<br/>\n&gt;because my group is fighting a caster, I have always chosen to sing a <br/>\n&gt;Rhythm<br/>\n&gt;based song with drums instead of the Psalms.  From my experience, caster<br/>\n&gt;mobs seem to have a restricted spell book, casting no more than 3 or 4<br/>\n&gt;different spells in any combat.  Of the 3-4 spells they will cast, it seems<br/>\n&gt;that only two different spell realms will be used, i.e. either magic based<br/>\n&gt;or one of the other areas (i.e. fire/cold/disease/poison).  IMO, it seems<br/>\n&gt;safer to hedge your bets and boost resist rates in three realms with the<br/>\n&gt;rhythm series versus only one with the Psalm series.  Will that 6 point<br/>\n&gt;difference (Psalm @ 51- Rhythm w/drum @ 45) really make that much of a<br/>\n&gt;difference?  It would if the mob only casted spells from one realm but how<br/>\n&gt;often does that happen?  This scenario assumes you don&#39;t have to tank the<br/>\n&gt;mobs and can equip a drum.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you are a tank by default and have to equip your weapons, IMO you still<br/>\n&gt;come out better singing a rhythm song instead of a Psalm.  You will <br/>\n&gt;increase<br/>\n&gt;resist rates by a total of 75 (25 in each realm).  Since mob casters tend <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;only use two realms of magic, you only get to use 50 of the extra resist<br/>\n&gt;points but that is still on par with what the Psalm will give you (51).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The only time I use a Psalm is to get the damage shield when we are <br/>\n&gt;fighting<br/>\n&gt;a melee mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is my rationale on song selection on track or am I missing out on <br/>\n&gt;something?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;29 bard<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
