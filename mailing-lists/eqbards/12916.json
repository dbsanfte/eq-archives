Puller screws up and we get a bad pull.  I go into<br/>\n&gt; crowd control mode to try to save the party.  Mobs all get pissed off at me.<br/>\n&gt; At that point, one of two things always occur: 1) Because most of the mobs<br/>\n&gt; are focused on me, I die and everyone else makes it out safely. 2)  Casters<br/>\n&gt; gate out and leave me and the melee classes to fend for ourselves.  Melee<br/>\n&gt; classes can still usually make it out safely since everything focused on me.<br/>\n&gt; In either situation, the caster always gets out safely.  Over the past few<br/>\n&gt; weeks, the only caster who has died in a party I was in was an enchanter who<br/>\n&gt; did an AE mez on a nasty pull.  Mez wore off before we could get rid of them<br/>\n&gt; all and she got bushwhacked when they woke up.  Since that occasion,<br/>\n&gt; whenever I group with an enchanter, the only crowd control song I keep<br/>\n&gt; memmed is lullaby.  I let the enchanter handle charm, mez and fear duties<br/>\n&gt; and will only use lullaby as a backup if the enchanter is getting attacked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A lot of bards like to say enchanters and clerics are our best friends.  I<br/>\n&gt; bet all the caster classes say a properly played bard is there best friend<br/>\n&gt; because we draw all the mobs attention away from them (in addition to the<br/>\n&gt; endless supply of caster crack we give them).    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just posted in EQ Vault - it was posted by Brad McQuaid (EQ&#39;s producer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and Lead Designer) on the official forum:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...  The idea is that casters are more prone to dying and thus can bind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in more places.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmmm.  I did a /guildsay to ask my guild which class they think dies most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; often.  The answers?:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 38 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;         You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
