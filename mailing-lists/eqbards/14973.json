Now - you&#39;d think<br/>\nregular invis wouldn&#39;t be just a heck of a lot of good in there - but I&#39;ve<br/>\ngotten in the habit of casting it so I can med pretty much unmolested by<br/>\nyard trash.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow - here is the interesting part (least to me).  Someone shouts train -<br/>\nand it&#39;s a doozy - from deep in the basement.  Out spill numerous assorted<br/>\nundead, bats, terrors, hags, etc.  By 36 - a lot of this stuff was green,<br/>\nthe remaining was blue - and I was still regular invis&#39;d.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was actually conning them to see if anything there would still give me<br/>\nany xp - but what I started noticing - once undead in Unrest get below a<br/>\ncertain stage of green - regular invis seems to work on them as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea if this is &#39;normal&#39; for undead but I don&#39;t remember ever<br/>\nseeing it before. I also don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve changed something because<br/>\none hag saw me - one didn&#39;t (and yes, I know hags aren&#39;t undead) - first<br/>\ntime I&#39;ve ever conned a hag invisible and she conned that she saw me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone got any ideas?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
