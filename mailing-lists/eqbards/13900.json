Even L30 mobs take enough out of you<br/>\n&gt;that soloing you can probably only keep 5-15 mobs clear before<br/>\n&gt;they start to respawn.  (Unless you&#39;re a necro, then you can<br/>\n&gt;keep all the seafury cyclopses in OOT clear solo.  :)  A L50<br/>\n&gt;in a L15 dungeon like Befallen I can see killing everything<br/>\n&gt;that moves, but there&#39;s really not much there to attract a<br/>\n&gt;L50.  There&#39;s the paw quest, but that&#39;s easily solved by<br/>\n&gt;moving that quest item to a higher level dungeon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; There is an advantage to camping a spawn area for those of us who<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are interested in XP as much if not more the items... you don&#39;t have to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; share the mobs with other groups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You do have to share the mobs with other groups.  It&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt;not obvious because it gets mixed into the time it takes your<br/>\n&gt;puller to find something.  If there are 20 people in a dungeon<br/>\n&gt;with 100 mobs that respawn every 30 minutes, then that&#39;s 5<br/>\n&gt;mobs per person per 30 minutes.  Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;camping one spot or sweeping through.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; best place to get XP, not items.  Ever try Sol B on a crowded night?  Try<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sitting in the noble room when there is a group in the circle room, pool<br/>\n&gt;&gt; room and kings room.  See how many spawns you get.  Not many.  Now<br/>\n </span></blockquote>imagine a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; dungeon where the good spawns can be anywhere or there are multiples...<br/>\n&gt;&gt; suddenly all those groups camping a particular area are suddenly running<br/>\n&gt;&gt; around and taking any spawns anywhere rather then sticking to there own<br/>\n&gt;&gt; marked off area.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It will be the same - the rate at which mobs respawn has not<br/>\n&gt;changed.  Better sweepers would have an advantage, but better<br/>\n&gt;pullers have an advantage now.  The overall rate of mob killer<br/>\n&gt;per person per hour cannot change.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Also, even worse, imagine if the Goblin King in Sol A could happen to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>spawn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; anywhere... what would those level 25&#39;s do who are fighting Cinders and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Youngs when the King suddenly spawns and bum rushes them.

Wouldn&#39;t want Naggy showing up at the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Personally I kinda like the way AC handles it by restricting dungeons to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; certain levels and having a lot more dungeons... if you aren&#39;t in a level<br/>\n&gt;&gt; range you cannot enter.
