I used to dual wield a dragoon dirk and barbed leather whip.<br/>\nIn combats that lasted more than a minute, the barbed leather whip would<br/>\ncause a serious stamina drain.  I would venture to guess that dual wielding<br/>\ntwo of them is even more severe.  I now dual wield thulian claws (cost me<br/>\n400PP) and a dragoon dirk.  In groups, very rarely does my stamina drop<br/>\nbelow one bub anymore, even after long combats.  The only time it will drop<br/>\nbelow one bub is if I am soloing a blue that takes me forever to kill.<br/>\nObviously you can avoid the stamina drain by singing the Jig but you could<br/>\nfree up that song slot and memorize a different song by equipping some<br/>\nweapons lighter than the barbed leather whips.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Neflyte &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Daniel.Grenon@...\">Daniel.Grenon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, I manage to accumulate some pp and now is the time to buy<br/>\n&gt; stuff. ;-) I have my Level 20 song and I now want to optimize my<br/>\n&gt; stats and stuff a little bit. I was to do exactly what is in this<br/>\n&gt; message<br/>\n&gt; then I decided that sharing this and asking for advice (or approval)<br/>\n&gt; would not hurt since we are talking several 100pp for the jewelry<br/>\n&gt; and equipment. If you need to know<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I use 2 Barbed Leather Whips (delay 28 damage 7) and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; the Dragoon Dirk. I can&#39;t afford Platinum jewelry.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
