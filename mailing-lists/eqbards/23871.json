From<br/>\nlvl 52 paladins who insist their guild has extensivly tested all bard haste<br/>\nsongs and they ALL stack with enchanter haste.  To lvl XX drewd who insisted<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t playing mana song since she was always LOM (I personally think it<br/>\nhad more to do with her casting group damage shield after our puller (and<br/>\nonly tank, sans the necro skelly) had left to pull).  I stood right next to<br/>\nher, watched the blue particles on her, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth people had happy &quot;endings&quot; though.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory 1<br/>\nElfson (me) &quot;Are you going to haste, &lt;enchanter name&gt;.  If so I will mem a<br/>\nnew song&quot;<br/>\nChanter &quot;I&#39;ll haste, do you want it?&quot; (What a great enchanter, she knew I<br/>\nmight be using instruments instead of weapons!)<br/>\nElfson &quot;Nah, I dont think a 40% increase in my kabonging damage will be<br/>\nworth the mana&quot;<br/>\nPally &quot;Sing haste song, they stack&quot;<br/>\nElfson (I should have this sentence hotkeyed for how often I say) &quot;There is<br/>\na bard haste song that stacks, but it is a whopping 5% haste, its not worth<br/>\nit.  The song icons will both stay on your buff list as the stat bonuses for<br/>\nmy song will stick, but the haste will not stack&quot;<br/>\nChanter &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure Elf is right&quot; (I love her, she even late defused a<br/>\nfight between me and a drewd who trained us, killing me)<br/>\nPally &quot;No my guild (name left out to protect the few people in this parade<br/>\nof fools who I like) tested it, they stack&quot;<br/>\n&lt;two fights go by, I am playing Cantata(34), Shield of Songs (I can&#39;t decide<br/>\nif I like this or Niv&#39;s for when we lack a cleric), and Absonant Binding<br/>\n(spelling butchered)&gt;<br/>\nPally &quot;Where is haste song?????&quot; (I may have added a question mark or two,<br/>\nheh)<br/>\n&lt;3 fights, same song mix, chanter, drewd and I are discussing merit of Rune<br/>\nSong vs Regen song, chanter loves rune song, drewd thinks regen would be<br/>\nbetter&gt;<br/>\n&lt;by the way, we kicking major butt right now, an uber warrior is pulling 3<br/>\nmobs at a time, and we never stop and rest&gt;<br/>\nElfson&#39;s Buddy &lt;via tell&gt; &quot;Got room for a dead sexy rogue and his feet?&quot; (ok<br/>\nmy friends are weird...)<br/>\nElfson &lt;via reply&gt; &quot;Not yet, let me see if anyone is leaving soon&quot;<br/>\nPally &quot;PLAY HASTE SONG!!!!&quot;<br/>\n&lt;target pally&gt;<br/>\n&lt;disband pally&gt;<br/>\nGod I love being leader...<br/>\nElfson &quot;Sorry I had to do that, if you guys want I will disband and you can<br/>\nreform with him&quot;<br/>\nOther 3 group members &lt;paraphrase&gt; &quot;No that ok, we&#39;ll stay, should we look<br/>\nfor a 6th?&quot;<br/>\n&lt;necro was Japanese I think, never said 3 words in the 2 hours he was<br/>\ngrouped&gt;<br/>\nElfson &quot;I know a rogue with some sexy feet who wants in, think we&#39;ll be ok<br/>\nwith no back up heal?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStory 2<br/>\nDrewd &lt;different from above drewd, only the warrior is the same&gt; &quot;LOM, play<br/>\nmana song&quot;<br/>\nElfson &quot;Been going since fight ended&quot;<br/>\n&lt;pause&gt;<br/>\nDrewd &quot;I dont see it on my screen&quot;<br/>\nElfson &quot;It doesnt have an icon&quot;<br/>\nDrewd &quot;Then why am I still LOM?&quot;<br/>\n&lt;I get up and make sure she was in area of spell&gt;<br/>\nElfson &quot;You&#39;re getting mana song, make sure you med close to the group, its<br/>\na small song.&quot;<br/>\n&lt;fight&gt;<br/>\nDrewd &quot;Play mana song!&quot;<br/>\nUberWarrior (who&#39;s primary I was on a 10 hour raid with the day before) &quot;See<br/>\nthose little blue sparkles?  Thats mana song!&quot;<br/>\n(I think at this point Uber Warrior lost it, he had been drumbling about the<br/>\ndrewd for a time)<br/>\nUberWarrior &quot;For once, I&#39;m in a decent group in Karnors, and I have to<br/>\nlisten a PhatlewtDrood complain about one of the few bards I&#39;ve seen on this<br/>\nserver who actually know what the hell they&#39;re doing!  Shut the hell up!!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway it was nice to some other people tired of clueless players telling<br/>\nbards what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlsi it was a fun weekend for me.  Got to raid CHardok (5 kings, 3 Queens),<br/>\nthen took a group of lower lvl guildies to Kaesora to get xp while a Ranger<br/>\nand I got our keys.  Of course some idiot warrior looted my fang... Grr.....<br/>\nBut all in all it was fun...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
