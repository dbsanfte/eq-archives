With the<br/>\nfirst nag and vox raids when there was not a large variety of resist<br/>\ngear, sure bards helped a lot.  Today, anyone can easily buff their<br/>\nresists with equipment.  Tests are inconclusive as to what point resists<br/>\nare soft-capped (anywhere from 175 to 255).  Level is the primary factor<br/>\nin resisting.  Equipment gives you permanent resists and resists buffs<br/>\nfrom other classes stay on you whereas resists from bards are gone when<br/>\nthey lag or die.<br/>\n<br/>\ni.e. there is nothing amazing about bard resists except impressing<br/>\nothers with big numbers, you haven&#39;t &quot;needed&quot; bards for resists in a<br/>\nlong time.  I&#39;m only talking about need with your and Dark&#39;s arguments.<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need a bard for resists, you don&#39;t need a bard for DS (every<br/>\nperson in an AL raid gets a diamond from the VP mage staff, DS done on<br/>\nEVERY person in the raid, not just 6 people in 1 group).  You only need<br/>\n1 bard for OOS.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I agree with Dark about 6-man EXP groups.  Bards are incredible IF<br/>\nthey are filling in the role of enchanter/shaman.  If an enchanter or<br/>\nshaman is there, there are things you CAN do, but the true skills of a<br/>\nbard are wasted.  On a big raid if there is more than 1 bard there,<br/>\nthere are things you CAN do, but another class could help the raid much<br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisclaimer: I loved my bard, always have.  I didn&#39;t quit cause of bards,<br/>\nwas cause of RL.  I didn&#39;t come back as a monk for any reason, I liked<br/>\nhow cured silk looked on humans, that&#39;s about it.  Ya I am 50 now I do<br/>\nlove the monk but will always be a bard at heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada/Erisi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 24, 2001 7:00 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally disagree Shada, bards are very useful, imo on large raids, the<br/>\nresistances they provide alone are amazing...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
