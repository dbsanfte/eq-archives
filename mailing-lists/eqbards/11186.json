Not that I&#39;m advocating crashing any <br/>\nservers here, but sometimes you have to &quot;get their attention&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m beginning to think if we don&#39;t get Verant&#39;s attention regarding bard <br/>\nissues, we will continue to be ignored, to our detriment.  I&#39;m not a rabble <br/>\nrouser for the most part, but we do have legitmate issues that are not being <br/>\naddressed by Verant.
