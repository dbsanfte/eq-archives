The playing of multiple notes at once is polyphany, as in a flute<br/>\nis Monophonic, one note at a time, while a piano is polyphonic as it can<br/>\nsound multiple notes at once.  Harmonizing using refers to separate<br/>\nmusicians playing diferent notes on the same rythym, but I can&#39;t offhand<br/>\nthink of a better term.  I too hate twisting as it brings back memories of<br/>\nmy entire group once chasing down a lone fleeing mob ala Roop&#39;s story,<br/>\nleaving me to handle the other four.
