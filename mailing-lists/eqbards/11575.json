I assumed wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be just on E&#39;ci, but greedy people are seriously trying to cash in<br/>\non lambent stones.  I got a few answers to my requests for stones, but the<br/>\ncheapest anyone was willing to give me one for was 20pp with some morons<br/>\nsaying they sell for 100-200pp each.  I agree with others on this list who<br/>\nrefuse to pay for the stones for various reasons.  I have spent over 1000pp<br/>\npurchasing gemstones (sapphires, rubies, etc etc) and I am not going to hand<br/>\nsome greedy bugger more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoooo, I am now camping SG&#39;s in oasis every opportunity I can but I killed 4<br/>\nlast night and did not find a single one.  I am joining pickup groups for<br/>\nthe purpose of giant hunting and I often have to convince my group members<br/>\nthat they should let me loot a stone should we find one.  I just don&#39;t get<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still need about 7 lambent stones total for the rest of my armor and I am<br/>\ncertainly not willing to pay another 200-1000pp to obtain them, I don&#39;t even<br/>\nhave that kind of money anymore after buying the other components.  But I<br/>\nhave been looking for my next stone for 4 in-game days now and have killed 5<br/>\ngiants and am still empty-handed.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or recommendations apart from soloing in<br/>\nthe Rathe mts and charming giants to kill each other?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
