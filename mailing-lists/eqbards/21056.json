Summer is just the busy season<br/>\nfor RL. I&#39;m on a new job and house hunting so play time is down to one or 2<br/>\ntimes a week. I&#39;ve gotten one bubble or so on 52 so far. I did finally get a<br/>\nsharkskin drum a month ago, one of those &#39;I can&#39;t believe it spawned!&#39; days.<br/>\nSeveral of my normal higher level group mates have been off alot as well, so<br/>\nmy wiz is finally gaining ground, up to 27 as of last night.<br/>\n I&#39;m currently looking at upgrade paths for my PC. I figure the new<br/>\nexpansion will kill my current machine since Kunark trees bog it down now. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow a question: Was Selo&#39;s Song of Travel intended for a high mortality rate<br/>\namong group members or is that just a bonus? I think I have killed everyone<br/>\nI know running across Dreadlands at least once.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe, 52 and Holding<br/>\nExcalibur, on Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
