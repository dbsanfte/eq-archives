I was grouped with a level 10 bard and with me<br/>\ntossing a couple heals his way, he could easily defeat a red<br/>\norc oracle.  At low levels the casting mobs don&#39;t have many hp<br/>\nand are pretty easy to kill before they can do much damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis changes at higher levels.  Drastically.  The casting<br/>\nbandits you&#39;ve run into are the tip of the iceberg.  If you<br/>\nrun into one I&#39;d imagine they&#39;re not much of a problem.  You<br/>\nknow that if you run into two, you can die pretty quick,<br/>\nright?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom about 15-20, casting desert madmen can drop you 3-4<br/>\nbubbles in just two spells, even the green ones.  The goblin<br/>\nevokers in Permafrost like to cast area effect spells that<br/>\nusually wiped out about a bubble from each party member.  And<br/>\nlast night in Cazic, a yellow judicator was casting wrath on<br/>\nme that was wiping out about a bubble and a quarter, even<br/>\nthough I had both bravery and symbol (nearly +200 hp in<br/>\nbuffs).  If I were soloing him, it would take a good 2-3<br/>\nminutes to whittle him down.  Meanwhile he&#39;s casting wrath on<br/>\nme every 5-10 seconds.  A couple days prior, I screwed up on a<br/>\npull and got two justicars, and they killed me with 4 spells.  <br/>\nI barely had time to tell the others to zone and kick in<br/>\nAccelerando.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
