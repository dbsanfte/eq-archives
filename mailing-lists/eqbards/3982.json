I was<br/>\nbusily guiding us to our destination when he makes a comment<br/>\nabout us going in circles.  I check my external view and he&#39;s<br/>\nnot on my boat.  He checks his external view and I&#39;m not on<br/>\nhis boat.  I sail back trying to find him or figure out what<br/>\nhappened, since he said he couldn&#39;t take control of his boat.<br/>\nI can&#39;t find him, so I gave up control of my boat in the hopes<br/>\nthat it would let him take control of his boat.  He did, and<br/>\nmy boat disappeared from underneath me, dumping me in the<br/>\nwater.  But everything looked strange.  It turned out I&#39;d been<br/>\nteleported when I was dumped, so that I was now in the water<br/>\n*under* land.  I swam a bit to &quot;shore&quot; and popped up onto the<br/>\nland.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided not to use a canoe to cross Lake Rathe.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
