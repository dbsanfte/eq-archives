The few times a bear or dire wolf has come to join the party at <br/>\nVox they provided a nice extra bit of experience.  I was wondering if anyone <br/>\nhas ever tried to pentrate down there for some experience camping.  Also the <br/>\nloot ain&#39;t too bad for money, I got a giant dire wolf pelt that sold for <br/>\nnearly 7 plat.  Better and lighter then most FS weapon loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
