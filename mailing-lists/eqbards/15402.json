First time I&#39;ve ever heard that term thrown out in<br/>\nregards to Everquest.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; No, this wouldn&#39;t be coded in this way.  EverQuest, for all the wondrous<br/>\n&gt; claims of its development team, is 99% Diku code from everything I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; able to tell (Right down to how emotes are coded)  They didn&#39;t even bother<br/>\n&gt; to change some of the methods for commands...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The basic &quot;Structure&quot; of the game is much much different but the combat<br/>\n&gt; engine behind everything looks/feels and sounds VERY close to original<br/>\n&gt; Diku<br/>\n&gt; code.  Experience in Diku code was very linear in progression and<br/>\n&gt; numerically based.  What little information I&#39;ve been able to wheedle out<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; friends  up at Verant leads me to believe this is still the case (they<br/>\n&gt; even<br/>\n&gt; use Mob #&#39;s to load NPC&#39;s etc still, just like in DIKU).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Which means that A) They&#39;ve tinkered with the original Diku experience<br/>\n&gt; tables (NEEDED!) and B) The Hell levels and the H+1 levels are either<br/>\n&gt; extremely intentional or some collosolly bad coding.  I&#39;d personally<br/>\n&gt; support<br/>\n&gt; either opinion equally.  I&#39;m not that impressed with Verant&#39;s programming<br/>\n&gt; prowess.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lyrnia Jongleur<br/>\n&gt; Bard of Norrath<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
