When folks train the really tough<br/>\nmonsters like that big Proon, they&#39;ll most certainly bring him this way.<br/>\nYes, I&#39;ll sit down right here, because I can be most certain this is where<br/>\nProon will be standing angrily when the fleeing person is gone.  And I will<br/>\nhave no time to even stand up before I&#39;m dead!  Perfect!  Oh that rivershore<br/>\nnearby is far too safe, Proon might not see me, completely unacceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot believe the angry shouts from these people, angry they were not<br/>\nwarned Proon was coming.  Dumb people.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday was the first day I actually quit a group and actually informed them<br/>\nit was because they were such a bad group.  Usually I am more discreet,<br/>\nbecause the bad players actually try to be good players, and may learn one<br/>\nday.  But this group, from their idiotic banter, to their actions, arrgh!<br/>\nThey got me killed by all four, not just one, the whole dullard lot of them<br/>\nchasing after a hurt monster, happily slashing away.  Meanwhile the bard is<br/>\nleft to fend for himself!  Not only that, I was stacking Hymn and Anthem...<br/>\nwith another bard in the group, playing... of all things, Accelerando!<br/>\nDuring battle!  He told me he was playing it because we might have to flee.<br/>\nFor the whole battle, he plays it, for when we flee.....  &lt;&lt;rolls eyes&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think bards may have a bad reputation by the dumb people who like just one<br/>\nsong, likely the entire basis of their class-choice, and play this song even<br/>\nat the innapropriate times!  This fool-bard also mentioned he was twinked so<br/>\nheavily because he sold crack.  &quot;Only the gods can help me now!&quot; I thought,<br/>\nand they didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
