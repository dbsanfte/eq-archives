I stayed around the<br/>\ngoblin tower, and carried a Greater Lightstone.  This way folks always knew<br/>\nwhere to swim to hear the song.  We had a few warriors and such, but a<br/>\nMagician and his pet helped enormously is chasing those pesky fleeing<br/>\ngoblins.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was just a riot, watching these enormous trolls gently swimming over my<br/>\nhead, and we all had a great time.  Remember several of them saying they<br/>\nnever had so much fun in Everquest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBad thing, those aqua goblins are right on the edge of giving you any<br/>\nexperience.  And it&#39;s kind of sad that this may be the only situation where<br/>\none can use the song in a group.  Travelling with the Aquatic Ayre would be<br/>\nplain suicidal (I&#39;ve tried, and heard the notes of panic in friend&#39;s<br/>\nvoices).  The radius of it seems so narrow, folks will drown if they depend<br/>\non the bard to give them water breathing in most situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The water breathing song and it&#39;s possible uses was one of the big factors<br/>\n&gt;in playiing a bard for me.
