The shuttles stop at the dock there and then go back<br/>\nto the big ship.  True, the ship is headed to the BB shuttles at that point,<br/>\nbut at least you will be on it and can just wait for it to complete the<br/>\ncircle.  No hanging around in water is required, there are even two taverns<br/>\non the island.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, a shuttle is a boat.  I am also quite reluctent<br/>\nto paddle around in the water for 20 min or so,<br/>\nchecking my loc all the while so that I can attempt<br/>\nclimbing onto one of those tall shuttles.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the patience and I am not that brave...there is a<br/>\nlvl 50 or thereabouts mob that swims near the teleport<br/>\npots for the evil races....I wasn&#39;t willing to wait<br/>\naround to see if it ranges far or has a cousin the<br/>\nlives to the North;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
