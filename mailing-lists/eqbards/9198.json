It allowed me to sol <br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;the bandit camp in Lesser Faydark 4 levels before anyone else I ever saw<br/>\n&gt;there.  No one else could handle the multiple spawns they would have to<br/>\n&gt;face, but I could easily pull one out at a time and make boocou plat off <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;bronze spears they carried.  same deal in w karana with bandits if you are<br/>\n&gt;careful.
