Their RNG is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-890812555\">I agree with your comments on Random Number Generators - however -<br/>\ncriticizing my comments - I wonder how long you&#39;ve played Everquest &lt;g&gt;...<br/>\nTheir RNG is CLEARLY flawed.  In particular - I use SSOY in the Lord Room as<br/>\nan Example.  I know MANY people who have LITERALLY camped it for two weeks<br/>\nin a row maybe a total of let&#39;s say 50 hours.  They report going days and<br/>\ndays of never seeing one - and then getting five in one session.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>\nof this happening on several occasions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example is Proc&#39;s and Failed Notes.  I almost never see just one or<br/>\nthree in a row.  I&#39;d say that about 85 percent of the time - I get two procs<br/>\nor two failed notes in a row.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve EVER seen three procs in<br/>\na row.  I RARELY have seen three missed notes in a row (discounting when low<br/>\ninstrument skills is a factor).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo &quot;Perhaps a Princess&quot; this is not Random according to the &quot;Experts&quot; in the<br/>\narticles I&#39;ve read. The issue of extrapolating on a small sample aside<br/>\n(which again I grant is true in my test on Kaesora but not my example of<br/>\nprocs/missed notes) A RNG should produce a truly random sample.  For a<br/>\nBinary test.  Consistently getting 45-50 0&#39;s followed by 2 1&#39;s 85 percent of<br/>\nthe time is bad code.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand - perhaps this is all a part of &quot;The Vision&quot; and they<br/>\nspecifically coded the RNG to work that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know a lot about a Statistics - but I&#39;ve been in the IT industry for<br/>\n16 years and read lots of articles about Random Number Generators for<br/>\ncomputing systems.  There are tests that can be done on the algorithm as to<br/>\nhow Pseudo-Random they are (obviously - by definition - an algorithm can&#39;t<br/>\nbe truly random)  I&#39;d be curious if Verant has done this analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is evidence of poorly coded random number generator.
