Full bronze which I worked<br/>\n  my ass of for from the first wave of L50s on Innoruuk.  This is<br/>\n  when a bronze bp would run about 75-100pp.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I put over 20 gnolls to sleep, ranging from scrawny to elite.<br/>\n  I lost maybe 2 or 3 bubbles of health for the 2 or 3 mins I stood<br/>\n  there holding them still.  That&#39;s right, completely still.  Hardly<br/>\n  anything attacked me, they stayed asleep until I stopped playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is how it used to be.  Verant (and GZ) blatantly lied that<br/>\n  they haven&#39;t adjusted this song since release.  I tried to sleep<br/>\n  off a few skeletons yesterday and I could not keep the group <br/>\n  controlled at all.  The programmers didn&#39;t just put in the failed<br/>\n  to mesmerize message, about 4 or 5 months ago they definitely F&#39;d<br/>\n  this song.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
