In the past i&#39;ve gotten 2 others, one<br/>\nof which i sold for 4k + a kylong wrist guard and the other i got a plat<br/>\ndiamond ring for.  This time I had 40 rubies, got a hoop on the 8th&#39;s ruby.<br/>\nTraded the hoop to a friend for the girdle....  Now i still had Lynuga up so<br/>\ni figured i&#39;d keep her and get another hoop.  Do NOT try to get 2 out of her<br/>\nin 1 spawn.  I wasted my 32 other rubies on her and didnt get any.  So the<br/>\nmoral of the story... I guess i paid 5300pp for the belt.  But the original<br/>\nplan was to get another hoop and sell it to replenish the cost of all those<br/>\nrubies.  Now i dont have enough cash to buy 20 more rubies to get another<br/>\nhoop *pout*.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;d be surprised how I&#39;ve upgraded my equipment by doing that silly<br/>\nexpensive yet very rewarding quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess its time to empty my good ol necro&#39;s bank account and get some more<br/>\nrubies hehe.  I think i&#39;ll be keeping the belt after reading up on it.  I<br/>\ndont have a haste belt, I was still using a troll hide belt (which i got on<br/>\nthe first spawn HAHA!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nAnnoying Ro  &lt;-- I still cant spell Annoeeye ro or however its spelled.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: January 10, 2001 6:12 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Sludged girdle?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ndoh, i shouldn&#39;t have given it to that level 24 bard on the boat in FV for<br/>\nfree =/<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I payed 8k for mine but that was about 2 months ago.
