I also feel a bit guilty. I&#39;ve also been accused of<br/>\ncheating by another player for doing it. There are a few things I thought of<br/>\nthat makes me feel somewhat better though.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. \tA number of casters have root. They can mostly do the same thing without<br/>\neven having to run.<br/>\n2. \tCasters with Spirit of Wolf and a number of persistent damage spells can<br/>\nlay on the spells and keep running away until the spells finally kill them.<br/>\n3. \tIt takes a hell of a long time to down something that is worth a decent<br/>\namount of experience. Maybe longer than it would take to get the same exp<br/>\nfrom blue going toe to toe.<br/>\n4.\tThere is the risk of Accelerando not kicking in depending on what you are<br/>\nstacking and then the risk of gettng stunned.<br/>\n5.\tThe biggest creature in the zone is always over the next hill and the<br/>\nplayer that pissed it off just zoned. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI generally don&#39;t kite for three reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tAttack skills don&#39;t go up when you kite.<br/>\n2.\tNo room to run in Paws let alone not having Accelerando down there.<br/>\n3.\tI&#39;m wearing out my hot keys that are mapped to Bellow and Accelerando not<br/>\nto mention my left arrow key. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhay you might try doing is kite them to soften them up and then cross<br/>\nswords with them to feel more of a risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Robertson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 26, 1999 2:51 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Kiting - Is it bad?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;John Robertson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReading someone else&#39;s post about killing beetles in North Karana got me<br/>\nthinking about an old debate I have often had with myself and others, namely<br/>\n&quot;Is kiting bad?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKiting, for those who don&#39;t know the term, means running along with a<br/>\nmonster<br/>\nchasing you (like you&#39;re flying a kite) while damaging it somehow.  The idea<br/>\nis<br/>\nthat the monster will never get close enough to hurt you, while you kill it.<br/>\nFor bards, this generally means Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow, though you could<br/>\nuse<br/>\nChords or Denon&#39;s if you&#39;re feeling wacky.<br/>\n<br/>\nI first discovered kiting when they finally &quot;fixed&quot; the Bellow in beta.  I<br/>\nsay<br/>\nfixed in quotes because they sort of broke it while they fixed it.  For a<br/>\nlong<br/>\ntime, the Bellow did not work.  When they finally made it functional, when I<br/>\nwas about level 15 or so, the first time I bellowed at something it did 37<br/>\npoints of damage.  (The bellow&#39;s damage has, of course, been toned down.<br/>\nNow<br/>\nat level 15 it does about 9 points)  The firepower of the thing was amazing.<br/>\nI<br/>\ndecided to try it out on something big and nasty, so I went to Oasis and<br/>\ndiscovered that I could kill crocodiles easily, without ever taking a point<br/>\nof<br/>\ndamage.  I levelled in about 2 hours, without swinging my axe once.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds great eh?  The only problem was, I felt guilty doing it.  GMs<br/>\nthroughout<br/>\nbeta had made it clear that if you could kill a monster with no risk to<br/>\nyourself at all, then you were exploiting.  I told myself, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not at<br/>\nno<br/>\nrisk, what if the thing stuns me?  What if I run over a dune into a Sand<br/>\nGiant?&quot; but it didn&#39;t wash with me.  These monsters had no chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love levelling as much as anyone.  I could have kited my way to level 50<br/>\nmaybe, who knows, all I needed was a nice white or yellow monster and room<br/>\nto<br/>\nrun.  The thing was, I just couldn&#39;t live with it, from a conscience<br/>\nperspective.  I stopped kiting.  I went toe to toe with things and got the<br/>\ncrap<br/>\nbeat out of me.  Maybe if I was pulling a monster to a safe place I&#39;d bellow<br/>\nat<br/>\nit as I ran, but that was it.  I felt better, but levelled slowly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the kiting word got out.  You couldn&#39;t go anywhere above ground in<br/>\nNorrath<br/>\nwithout seeing some bard, usually one I&#39;d never heard of before but who was<br/>\nnow<br/>\nalmost my level, running along with a monster occasionally pulsing yellow<br/>\nbehind him.  Every time I saw that, it made me a little mad, but I didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow<br/>\nwhether I was mad at me, Verant or the kiting bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still refuse to kite.  I don&#39;t let the druid in my party (druids kite<br/>\nbetter<br/>\nthan anyone) kite.  I still think it&#39;s lame when I see someone kiting, but I<br/>\nunderstand why they do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question is, am I alone in my beliefs here?  How do other bards out<br/>\nthere<br/>\nfeel about this?<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAre you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nFriends tell friends about ONElist!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
