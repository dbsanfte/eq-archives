It&#39;s time to put Voodoo cards to bed.<br/>\nThey don&#39;t support 32 bit graphics (and even the new Voodoo5 spec isn&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to.  They will run as fast but the color depth just won&#39;t be there.<br/>\nIn short, the folks at 3dfx need to get it in gear and quit resting on their<br/>\nlaurels...  16bit color is nice but with every new NVidia chip supporting 32<br/>\nbit (and soon 64 bit color I suspect) 3dfx is going to wind up getting<br/>\ndusted even worse than they are right now by the GeForce.  If you&#39;re running<br/>\na Voodoo card I&#39;d recommend, when you do upgrade, that you go to an NVidia<br/>\nchipset or a Bitboys chipset.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour mileage may vary (but in this case unless something rather significant<br/>\nhappens over at 3dFX they&#39;re going to wind up hurting badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nKev<br/>\naka:  Lyrnia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you are running a PIII then the cheaper TNT2 sounds like your best<br/>\n&gt; alternative until the new Voodoo4/5 series or NV15 come out.

Otherwise (if you did have a PIII setup or<br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Athlon to a much lesser extent) in many areas the TNT2 Ultra will do<br/>\n&gt; almost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as well as the GeForce card.

Or stick to what works now and just<br/>\n&gt; pay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; $400 later?  The advantages of the GeForce are great.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an AWESOME card.  But I would recommend doing some pretty extensive<br/>\n&gt; reading<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of the GeForce (or any 2nd gen card)  before I<br/>\n&gt; run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out and buy it.  3rd Generation cards are just around the corner.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; OH:  For the hard core Gamers:  If you get a Gig system:  Don&#39;t get one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; based on Intel&#39;s i820 or i840 chipset, get either the VIA FBS 133<br/>\n </span></blockquote>chipset<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; with 133 SDRAM or get a BX 440 chipset and overclock the board to 133mhz<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; use SDRAM 133.  You will get FAR better performance out of the Intel Gig<br/>\n&gt; &gt; system on those Mboards and your games (IE:  EverQuest) will run a lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
