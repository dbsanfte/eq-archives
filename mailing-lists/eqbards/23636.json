My personal preference <br/>\nwould have been to sing Celerity, chains and clarity. Celerity because of <br/>\nthe monk, chains because of snare/slow, and clarity to make the cleric happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a cleric, monk and bard, I&#39;m not sure the magic resistance debuff is <br/>\nreally worth the effort. Then again, if the cleric is chain stunning, it <br/>\nmay have some merit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in Karnor&#39;s last night twisting Berserker Crescendo, Chains (we had <br/>\nnobody snaring) and clarity at the Drolvarg Capt&#39;s camp. I&#39;m only 45 and <br/>\nthis was my first time really fighting in Karnor&#39;s. My friend said it was <br/>\nextremely rare that a 45 would get invited to this and that I&#39;d normally <br/>\nget laughed at, but I&#39;d rather be naive and in a group, than wise and <br/>\nsitting around.<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup consisted of 2 paladins, cleric, necro, magician and me. I&#39;m really <br/>\nglad we were able to handle multiples without crowd control, as at my <br/>\nlevel, I couldn&#39;t pixie strike anything. I was able to charm a drolvarg <br/>\nwhen we were waiting at the zone, but that was the only time I ever needed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe rolled along just fine at the Capt&#39;s camp and even had him spawn a <br/>\ncouple of times (mantle and cobalt gauntlets dropped) as well as a <br/>\ndeathbringer&#39;s rod from a berserker. I only won 1 roll and that was for a <br/>\nKunzar cloak, rolled a 100 out of 100 (where was that roll for the <br/>\ndeathbringer&#39;s rod?). A couple of near deaths from multiples, but <br/>\notherwise, pretty steady.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, when one of the pally&#39;s left, a very bossy shaman (level 56 or so) <br/>\njoined the group. She ordered me to stop singing Crescendo as it was <br/>\nblocking her haste, and constantly called for &quot;manasong&quot; (why can&#39;t they <br/>\njust ask for Clarity?). She asked the necro to snare, and of course, she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t give me a speed buff. Since she was also slowing down the mob&#39;s atk <br/>\nspeed, there was no reason for me to sing chains. I have no idea if the <br/>\nberserker crescendo blocks her speed buffs, but since there was only 1 <br/>\nother tank, probably wasn&#39;t a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI switched to singing Jonathan&#39;s provocation for myself, and 2 pulses of <br/>\nclarity. Was a nicer speed buff for myself. When I got low on stamina (Yak <br/>\nand Kisch) I&#39;d switch over to Cantana (sic) and 2 pulses of clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be open to other singing suggestions since I shot through level&#39;s 43 <br/>\nand 44 real fast (thank you bloodgills) and haven&#39;t had much time to test <br/>\nvarious songs in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:25 PM 1/29/01 -0600, James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I dont know if I would pick those songs (what level bard? depends on what<br/>\n&gt;choices were available) but they are not that far off base:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Chains: good snare and atk slow down<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fufil&#39;s not only does some targeted damage but it also reduces the mob&#39;s MR<br/>\n&gt;(if anything, lead with Fufils so next thing sticks better.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Psalm of cooling: it gets awful hot and sweaty in Lower Guk and the damage<br/>\n&gt;shield also helps - especially if more than on mob is awake.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just a thought,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Matt DeBarger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Monday, January 29, 2001 11:12 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Soloing bards<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Heh with my cleric (who normally plays only in his regular group, but with<br/>\n&gt;my play I have missed several sessions and need to catch up), I was gfrouped<br/>\n&gt;with a monk and a bard in L Guk (&quot;How long could it take for us to tfind a<br/>\n&gt;tank, lets get the ass sup camp while we wait&quot;).  The bard was singing the<br/>\n&gt;oddest collection of songs.  Chains (good choice with no snarer or slower),<br/>\n&gt;Curtailing Chant (with weapons) and Pslam of Cooling.  Eh????  I suggested<br/>\n&gt;singing celerity night be more useful (though I am loathe to ever say<br/>\n&gt;anything) since the monk was dual wielding knuckledusters.
