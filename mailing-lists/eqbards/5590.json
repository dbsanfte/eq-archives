In the wrong<br/>\nplace at the wrong<br/>\n&gt;       time, this can be a disaster.  However, I have<br/>\nused it<br/>\n&gt;       effectively a few times as a panic button,<br/>\ngiving my party (or<br/>\n&gt;       what remained of it) time to zone.  I guess it<br/>\ncould also be<br/>\n&gt;       used for reverse-kiting in safer areas, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve never tried<br/>\n&gt;       that.  Because of its limited usefulness, I<br/>\nrarely have it<br/>\n&gt;       memorized, unless I strongly suspect a pending<br/>\ndisaster.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I vastly underestimated this song, and relegated<br/>\nit to<br/>\n    practicing brass skill.  Then while we were in the<br/>\ndepths of<br/>\n    Guk, I happened to have it memorized when we got<br/>\nin over our<br/>\n    heads. My friends all ran out of the song&#39;s range<br/>\nand died<br/>\n    within 30 seconds.  I made it from the Lord room<br/>\nto the zone<br/>\n    (a 1-2 minute run) losing only 2 bubbles.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Later, after I recovered their corpses and they&#39;d<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n    resurrected and were sitting out the resurrection<br/>\neffects at<br/>\n    the zone, someone dumped a train on us.  So I<br/>\nfired up Screech<br/>\n    again, and I&#39;ll be damned it worked.  The cleric<br/>\nhad to heal<br/>\n    me once in the 2+ minutes we sat there waiting for<br/>\nthe others<br/>\n    to finish looting and regain enough strength to<br/>\nmove, but we<br/>\n    went from a really bad situation to a yawner with<br/>\nthe cleric<br/>\n    &quot;practicing&quot; some little-used spells on the<br/>\nfleeing frogs to<br/>\n    kill time.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I think we will change our dungeon retreat<br/>\nstrategy to me<br/>\n    firing up this song, and everyone sticking close<br/>\nto me as we<br/>\n    *slowly* make our way to the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\nI was ecstatic about this song as I thought it would<br/>\nkeep me alive!  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you need to stop and restart this song repeatedly<br/>\nor are you leaving it on?  I twice failed in my<br/>\nattempts to use this for myself running out in Guk:<br/>\nonce the Shin Lord room (tal shaman on me) and once<br/>\nthe prison (warden on me), although I came very very<br/>\nclose the second time.  Is it best to stand still<br/>\nduring the first screech to evaluate the<br/>\neffectiveness?  Or just high-tail it whilst jamming<br/>\nthe screech button?<br/>\n<br/>\n[As an aside, I was using Clouding (invis) both times<br/>\nwhen I was attacked.  Is it that one or both of those<br/>\nin particular have see invis or was I unlucky?  I have<br/>\nrun down to check Shin Lord spot a few times without<br/>\nbeing jumped before but perhaps I stepped into room a<br/>\nbit too far?  Went too close to warden?  It has also<br/>\nfailed repeatedly in Cazic in the maze where I know<br/>\nthe lizards don&#39;t have see invis.  Ouch.]<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn, have you tried screech in Cazic with the higher<br/>\nlevel lizards?  I have used on the lower level ones<br/>\nsuccessfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore general: please share more get-out-of death<br/>\nstrategies.  I die a lot (ouch, hehe) as I&#39;m sure many<br/>\nbards do because of the taunt effect of many of our<br/>\nsongs, especially in indoor dungeons.  Screech is one<br/>\nstrategy.  Would pixie striking help?  Lullaby?<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n     It&#39;s also good for Chain/Fear attacks (snare/Fear<br/>\nis probably<br/>\n     better as then there&#39;s less chance of the Fear<br/>\neffect wearing<br/>\n     off due to resists).  This will significant cut<br/>\ndown the<br/>\n     damage you take when fighting ultra-powerful<br/>\nmelee mobs<br/>\n     (griffins, giants, cyclopses, etc).<br/>\n-------------<br/>\nChain/fear makes soloing a much more enjoyable<br/>\nexperience.  Not only can you follow behind something<br/>\nhitting, bellowing, and DoTing it from behind, you can<br/>\nsometimes scare off that extra one you really didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant while keeping the one you did chained.<br/>\n<br/>\n============================================================================<br/>\n&gt; 28 -- Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike.  If this cleared the<br/>\nmob&#39;s shit-list,<br/>\n&gt;       it would be fantastic.  As it is, I find it<br/>\ndisappointing.  It<br/>\n&gt;       is certainly no substitute for the enchanter&#39;s<br/>\nmesmerize.  If I<br/>\n&gt;       can really charm multiple mobs at once, then I<br/>\nsee no real<br/>\n&gt;       advantage to mesmerizing, but if charm is<br/>\nlimited to one at a<br/>\n&gt;       time, then I guess mesmerize could be useful<br/>\nas an alternative<br/>\n&gt;       to lullaby.  Still, it seems that when<br/>\nmesmerizing two or three<br/>\n&gt;       mobs, I&#39;d have to pull out of the fighting<br/>\ncompletely, whereas<br/>\n&gt;       with lullaby I can still be in there bashing<br/>\non the same guy<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;       party is attacking.  Not currently memorized,<br/>\nbut maybe I need<br/>\n&gt;       to experiment with this more.<br/>\n<br/>\n    My experience has been that mobs break out of<br/>\nLullaby more<br/>\n    often and more quickly than with Strike.  Also, I<br/>\ndunno what<br/>\n    weapons you use or who you usually group with, but<br/>\neach of the<br/>\n    folks I&#39;m grouped with typically do twice as much<br/>\ndamage as me<br/>\n    in a fight, and there are usually two or three of<br/>\nthem.  So<br/>\n    it&#39;s not a problem for me to drop out of a fight<br/>\nand stick to<br/>\n    just my instruments while striking two or three<br/>\nmobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Another thing it does is interrupt casters, which<br/>\nis great in<br/>\n    certain areas since it&#39;s not area effect like<br/>\nLullaby.  If<br/>\n    we&#39;re fighting something like a lizard herald or<br/>\njusticar, I<br/>\n    will just strike it over and over instead of<br/>\nsinging any other<br/>\n    songs.  Between me and the paladins casting stun,<br/>\nsolo casting<br/>\n    mobs usually get off 0-1 spells during a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\nVery effective for interrupting casters!  I saw that<br/>\nsuggestion here and have been using it in Cazic ever<br/>\nsince.  Thanks, guys.  =)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 29 -- Psalm of Vitality.  Um.  Okay, great disease<br/>\nresistance.  (No<br/>\n&gt;       poison resistance at all, despite what I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen on some of the<br/>\n&gt;       song listings.)  Big whoop.  Am I going to be<br/>\nfighting anything<br/>\n&gt;       where people are going to care about this? <br/>\nThe last time I<br/>\n&gt;       fought anything with disease, it was the<br/>\nundead gnolls in Lake<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has a pretty nice AC bonus (same as Chant of Battle<br/>\nwith a<br/>\ndrum), but then so does Psalm of Warmth, and that has<br/>\na damage<br/>\nshield to boot, so yeah, pretty useless.  Maybe if<br/>\ndiseases<br/>\nreally meant something, like they added lycanthropy,<br/>\nthen this<br/>\nsong would be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\nPsalm of Warmth has an AC bonus?  I will have to check<br/>\nthat out.  I like Psalm of Warmth as well when I am<br/>\nthe lowest level person in the group.  Many of the<br/>\noffensive songs are repeatedly resisted so I<br/>\nconcentrate on the defensive or non-combat ones:<br/>\nwarmth, anthem, and heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso regarding Psalm of Warmth, I see the &#39;xxx was<br/>\nburned&#39; message much more often than the &#39;xxxx was hit<br/>\nby non-melee damage for 5 points&#39; (insert exact<br/>\nwording).  What is your experience on the relative<br/>\nfrequencies?  Are the burned messages alone only an<br/>\nindication that it is up and working and the damage is<br/>\nonly done when the non-melee message appears?<br/>\n<br/>\n============================================================================<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d appreciate any observations that run counter to<br/>\nmy own analysis,<br/>\n&gt; plus some insight on what&#39;s coming up for me in the<br/>\n30&#39;s.  Do any of<br/>\n&gt; these new songs really rock?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Clarity (L32) is probably the most anti-climactic<br/>\nsong you<br/>\n    will ever get.  Everyone wants it, you can&#39;t wait<br/>\nfor it, and<br/>\n    when you finally do get it... nothing.  You cannot<br/>\nsee<br/>\n    *anything* this song does because it does not<br/>\naffect you in<br/>\n    the slightest (except the annoying spam messages).<br/>\n All you<br/>\n    get are reassurances from anyone who&#39;s not a bard,<br/>\nmonk,<br/>\n    warrior, or rogue, that yes, their mana is indeed<br/>\nregenerating<br/>\n    faster.  More like a whimper than a bang.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\nI am sure I will need to carry a towel to deal with<br/>\nall the drooling when I reach 32.  I am currently<br/>\ncarrying a stick to poke those who say &quot;Oh, you&#39;re not<br/>\na mana bard?  =(&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo of the Jus Divinum<br/>\n30th season<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
