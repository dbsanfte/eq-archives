I will do some testing tonight myself, and<br/>\nsee if it stacks with Verses of Victory or any of our other battle songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI hate to say it, but maybe our persistant testing and posting has<br/>\npaid off finally.  Matter of fact I wont say that, since VI will probably<br/>\njust nerf us again anyhow!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLago<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; So the new version of Jonthan&#39;s Provocation looks like it will help us<br/>\n&gt; solo<br/>\n&gt; blue mobs tremendously.  If it still included the rune shield, soloing<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; be even easier coz there would be less downtime for healing.  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
