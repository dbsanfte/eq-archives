Every named mob is always spawned, but<br/>\nyou can only kill/loot it once in your character&#39;s lifetime.  <br/>\nItem rarity is then determined by the frequency of the item<br/>\nappearing on that mob.  As it is now, item rarity is<br/>\ndetermined by the the number of players willing to camp the<br/>\nmob for umpteen hours to get the item.  That would get the<br/>\nspecial items more evenly distributed among the playerbase,<br/>\nrather than having them concentrated in the hands of those<br/>\nwith prodigious amounts of otherwise fruitless camping time.<br/>\nIt&#39;d also stop farming and eBay selling cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some other changes minor needed to make it work<br/>\nproperly.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
