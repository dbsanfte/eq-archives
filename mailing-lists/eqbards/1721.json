Its a testament to this mailing list that<br/>\nthe responses have been well thought out and eloquently scripted.  There<br/>\ndon&#39;t appear to be many kewl doodz on this mailing list.  In contrast, the<br/>\nEQ Vault General message board has denigrated into nothing but a continuous<br/>\nflamewar for the most part.  I would even go so far as to state that there<br/>\nprobably aren&#39;t too many kewl doodz playing bards.  Taking a big leap here,<br/>\nI would guess that a kewl dood playing a bard would have some serious<br/>\nconiption fits.  He wouldn&#39;t have the ability to dish out or receive massive<br/>\namounts of damage.  He wouldn&#39;t be able to kill steal effectively.  He<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have the ability to powergame as effectively as he would if he were<br/>\nplaying another class.  Instead, he would actually have to incorporate some<br/>\nstategy and tactics into his gameplay.  This is just my stereotype of the<br/>\ndoodz so take it for what its worth.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2) I am getting absolutely no work accomplished today.  I don&#39;t subscribe to<br/>\nthe digest so I get these messages as soon as they are posted.  I, of<br/>\ncourse,  have to read every one of them and soon as I get them an inevitably<br/>\nthat occurs right when I&#39;m in the middle of something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin (wishing he didn&#39;t have to spend so much time at work and school)<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
