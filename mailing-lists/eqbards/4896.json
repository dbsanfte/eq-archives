The first time I saw really good AI is<br/>\n&gt; when I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; took out my bow at level 7 to hit a gnoll to bring it to me.  Instead of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charging though, it did the same thing!  And continued to until I got<br/>\n&gt; into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; melee range (where it brought out its long sword and started meleeing).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You don&#39;t think healing in battle is smart AI?
