Hey, if a<br/>\ndog was singing a seranade outside my window, I&#39;d throw a flower pot<br/>\nat it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, sound does travel longer over enclosed areas, so singing<br/>\noutdoors is not as bad as singing indoors.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, what does become irritating is the fact that the monsters<br/>\nwill continually attack the bard in the group despite the fact that a<br/>\nwizard just unloaded 200 points of damage into it.  By the time you<br/>\nturn the music off, you&#39;re so weak that the monsters target you for<br/>\nthat reason instead!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to choose between attacking the dog howling his lungs off<br/>\nand the dog who&#39;s biting my foot, I&#39;d attack the foot-biter ...<br/>\n<br/>\n... of course, maybe the monster was being extremely intelligent in<br/>\ntargeting that one member in the party that lets the party survive a<br/>\ndungeon crawl with little downtime.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
