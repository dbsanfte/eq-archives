I&#39;m level 19, but I&#39;d<br/>\nstill die in a heartbeat if one of the undead happened to get a hold of me.<br/>\nI like having a zone I actually worry about getting through safely.  It&#39;s<br/>\nbecome one of those zones parents tell their little children about to scare<br/>\nthem. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say there IS things for level 50&#39;s to do, I said there SHOULD be.<br/>\n:)  I know there&#39;s hardly anything to do.  I&#39;m on Tunare, and the number of<br/>\npeople in the high 40&#39;s up to 50 is getting to be rather insane.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething does need to be done, and done quickly.  Zones zones zones.  That<br/>\nis the ONLY way to solve the overcrowding problem.  Maybe they should think<br/>\nabout hiring 5 more people and getting them to work on zones exclusively.<br/>\nThere&#39;s plenty of areas where a zone would fit nicely in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a subterranean zone with an entrance in the Qeynos sewers.  (Some<br/>\nworkers were repairing a wall, when &lt;crack&gt; the floor opened up, and they<br/>\nfell into a deep chasm.)  Populate it with some sort of cavern dwelling<br/>\nbeasties.  Possibly have a zone inside this one.  Have the initial one for<br/>\nmid-levels (15-25 or so maybe), and have the deepest section of it enter a<br/>\nnew zone, for 30+.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say something on Odus, but Paineel is supposed to open one of the<br/>\ndecades, isn&#39;t it?  That&#39;s going to be another high level zone, if I<br/>\nremember correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s one spot in the Oasis that looks like it&#39;s a valley, and should lead<br/>\nsomewhere, but it doesn&#39;t.  Is that going to be a new zone someday?  If not,<br/>\nthey could put one there.  Maybe the &quot;home of the sand giants&quot; or some such.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn, I should work for Verant.  I&#39;ll whip up these zones myself, dangit!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Gaelaian, hopeful bard of the 19th song, Tunare.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
