Most of the time, I play on 2 PC&#39;s side by<br/>\nside.  Lately, doing mostly guild events killing various epic mobs: General<br/>\n4 times, Big Ele a few times, the Monk skelly in LIO for the first time this<br/>\nweek, swimming in the big lava crater last week, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to that spreadsheet:<br/>\n<br/>\n58 HEF Bard gets 72% <br/>\n49 HIE Pally gets 28%<br/>\n<br/>\nBut remember that the 49 Pally needs lots less exp points to fill his bubs -<br/>\nso to him it could look like he is getting &quot;more&quot; exp. E.g.: they kill 200<br/>\nmobs and pally gets 2 bubs while bard gets half a bub.
