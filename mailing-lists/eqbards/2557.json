I haven&#39;t done it as much as I wanted to <br/>\nbecause it isn&#39;t worth it anymore as the creatures in question are mostly <br/>\nblue to me now but imagine how happy I&#39;d have been to have found this spot <br/>\nwhen they were all red.  My point really is--hold on to your helms, <br/>\nRPers--who cares how you get your levels as long as you get them and get on <br/>\nto the getting of the cool stuff so you can whip Lord Mistmore?  Oh the <br/>\ndismay and anger the purple people showered me with as they watched me <br/>\n&quot;cheat&quot;.  Far as I am concerned, playing honorably with an object like a <br/>\ncomputer game is just plain silly.  If the bug wasn&#39;t there I *couldn&#39;t* <br/>\nexploit it so therefore it is Verant&#39;s fault, not mine, that I--or anyone <br/>\nelse for that matter--can use it.  It isn&#39;t cheating.  It is using your head <br/>\nto take advantage of an opportunity granted, intentional or otherwise.  <br/>\nBottom line: RPers, generally, are exactly as Shanda said--a bunch of wacko <br/>\npowermad control mongers who chastise and harrass &quot;normal&quot;--stress the word <br/>\n&quot;normal&quot;--people.  They are like the Bob Barrs of Everquest.  Play how they <br/>\nwant you to play or they will contact a GM(the granddaddies and epitomy of <br/>\npowermad RPers)and bring legislation against you.  This is the only problem I <br/>\nhave ever found with an otherwise outstanding game.  Purple people mind your <br/>\nown freakin&#39; business and quit whining to the GMs every time you see someone <br/>\nplaying the way your dork ass wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nCooter<br/>\n21st no matter how I got here.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
