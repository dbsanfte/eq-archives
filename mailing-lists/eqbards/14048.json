After one of the server crashes the same<br/>\ngroup of people went after her again and we got killed again she got a<br/>\nComplete Heal off and then we were in trouble. Tried her again then ext<br/>\nnight same thing happened. Then just last night we went after naggy and took<br/>\nhim down quit quickly I bet it was no more then 5 minutes with only 2<br/>\ndeaths.
