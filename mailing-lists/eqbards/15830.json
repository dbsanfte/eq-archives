The key is finding ppl who  know how to play or who<br/>\nlisten.  With a good group of lvl 18-19s I can pull from the second floor. I can usually come back with a<br/>\nsingle CG or monk or even a barbed. If I pull 2 we are still ok. If I run into a train and pull a bunch<br/>\nmore than I expect, I just equip the drum, shout,  and head to the zone. What you need to do is determine<br/>\nif you have too much on you and break BEFORE you are in trouble.<br/>\n I might train to zone once an evening, and I die much more rarely.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 6 Mar 2000, Stephen E.

I spent levels 20-25 in Unrest and gained about 3-4<br/>\n&gt; bubbles a night (granted this was long ago, but it was still<br/>\n&gt; crowded with about 60-80 people there).  Maybe I was fortunate<br/>\n&gt; in not ending up grouped with boneheads.
