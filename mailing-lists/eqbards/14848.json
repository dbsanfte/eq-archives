We absolutely love playing the bard class<br/>\nand most of us would probably agree that it is the best choice we could have<br/>\nmade in terms of enjoying the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, these high level players have been playing for about 9<br/>\nmonths (at least) longer than you and the game has gone through a lot of<br/>\nchanges during that time.  We all tend to get on rants from time to time but<br/>\nfact of the matter is, we do it because we love our bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to Norrath fellow songweaver.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nHalf-Elf Bard of the 39th (and holding) song on E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jennifer McComb [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mccomb@...\">mccomb@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 11, 2000 1:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] New bard questions<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Jennifer McComb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mccomb@...\">mccomb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let me introduce myself.  I&#39;m a new player to Everquest <br/>\n&gt; (received it for<br/>\n&gt; Christmas).  I&#39;ve played an Erudite paladin up to level 7, a Barbarian<br/>\n&gt; shamon up to level 9, and now I&#39;m a half elf bard at level 7.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I subscribed to this mailing list a few days ago and so far have just<br/>\n&gt; seen postings that talk about the higher levels.  I&#39;ve also <br/>\n&gt; noticed that<br/>\n&gt; many of the posts sound unsatisfied with the bard character.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My questions: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At level 7, what should I be concentrating on now?  What <br/>\n&gt; items should I<br/>\n&gt; be pursuing in the near future?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you had it to over again, would you even pursue the bard <br/>\n&gt; route?  What<br/>\n&gt; makes the bard fun?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jerrilia - Bard of the 7th song.
