I&#39;m a new player to Everquest (received it for<br/>\nChristmas).  I&#39;ve played an Erudite paladin up to level 7, a Barbarian<br/>\nshamon up to level 9, and now I&#39;m a half elf bard at level 7.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI subscribed to this mailing list a few days ago and so far have just<br/>\nseen postings that talk about the higher levels.  I&#39;ve also noticed that<br/>\nmany of the posts sound unsatisfied with the bard character.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy questions: <br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 7, what should I be concentrating on now?  What items should I<br/>\nbe pursuing in the near future?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you had it to over again, would you even pursue the bard route?  What<br/>\nmakes the bard fun?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJerrilia - Bard of the 7th song.

That way, <br/>\n                             when he finds out what you said about <br/>\n\t\t\t     him, you&#39;re a mile away, and he&#39;s barefoot.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
