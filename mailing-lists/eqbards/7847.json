For a test,<br/>\ntry singing nothing when your puller grabs some MOBs.  They&#39;ll stick on him<br/>\n- or at least they do in my experiece.  If I have any song going when the<br/>\npuller comes back to the group, the &quot;free&quot; MOBs will start attacking me.  I<br/>\noften wonder what would happen if I handled my songs in the same manner that<br/>\n(skilled) magic-users do (i.e. don&#39;t sing anything until the MOBs in<br/>\nquestion have taken a decent throttling from the tanks).<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 28 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Christine [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christine@...\">christine@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, October 04, 1999 8:14 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] RE: Learning with Lullaby<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Christine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christine@...\">christine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I am finding as I am going to more and more grouped dungeon settings that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the monsters are concentrating on me more than anyone else in the group.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Everyone is asking if I am singing chords or dissonance (which I don&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>use<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; for that reason) because it is so obvious the monsters have it out for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>me.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Between L10-15 is the worst time for this as a bard.  It<br/>\n&gt;continues to be bad if you use Lullaby liberally after L15.<br/>\n&gt;Starting at L20, it starts to ease off as the other melee<br/>\n&gt;classes start getting their damage bonuses and extra attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This seems to be the case for me as well. All extra mobs on a pull will<br/>\nattack me almost 100% of the time. And any passing mob will attack me when<br/>\nit joins in a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if it is because I&#39;m playing Hymn? I&#39;m guessing that when the<br/>\nmobs come over and they&#39;re not really mad at anyone yet (just a little bit<br/>\nat the puller) then they&#39;ll want to attack me since I&#39;m healing. Or is it<br/>\nthe vague &quot;Bard Hate&quot; thing. :) What do you guys think?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;m going to try to NOT play Hymn at the very beginning of a battle<br/>\n(so far I&#39;m always twisting Anthem and Hymn, even in the very beginning when<br/>\nno one is hurt). Hopefully the mobs that are not being fought yet will hit<br/>\nthe tanks and/or puller, and then several rounds later when I start to play<br/>\nHymn they won&#39;t be so mad at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaleia (who just hates making mobs mad!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
