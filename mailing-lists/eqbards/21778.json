I mean, I may tend to turn a cynical eye to things<br/>\nGordon says, but even so I can&#39;t see how even the most optimistic of people<br/>\ncould find that post anything but an insult.  There was no promise to look<br/>\nat anything within any sort of definable time frame.  Gordon said the skill<br/>\ncaps would be raised, probably to the 235 the other casters have.  Other<br/>\nthan that we got zero in the way of positive response.  saying that Summon<br/>\nFood might be inappropriate as an effect and that they would look at it<br/>\nagain was nothing different from the same sort of brush off we have gotten<br/>\nbefore.  There was no battle, we were told in no uncertain terms that A: we<br/>\nare not a high priority, nor is anything related to our class, and B: the<br/>\nsongs which are ineffective or useless are so by design.  I&#39;m way past down.<br/>\nI&#39;m at resigned.  Acceptance, the final phase of being cured of the notion<br/>\nthat Verant gives a damn.  I&#39;m also secure in the knowledge that neither I,<br/>\nnor 90% of my guild will ever buy a future Verant product.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Mann [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 11, 2000 10:06 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Abashi finally responds... sort of<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I mentioned in that thread, you can&#39;t expect to win everything in one<br/>\nbattle.  We recieved a great many concessions yesterday, and as such,<br/>\ninstead of getting down about it, I feel much more optimistic about future<br/>\nenhancements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings like Lullaby and Chains won&#39;t be fixed until someone at VI begins<br/>\nplaying a bard as their primary character.  That, therefore, is something<br/>\nthat I am willing to &quot;agree to disagree&quot; for now.  The fact that Abashi<br/>\nanswered the whoe demmed list also gives me great optimism.  Why?  Because I<br/>\nthink Abashi now feels great empathy for bards?  Heck no!  Read between the<br/>\nlines of his own post. Someone &quot;handed&quot; him the list that came from the<br/>\nConcert Hall?  He has now recognized that the Concert Hall is the main hub<br/>\nfor the bardic community.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list of issues has been posted and re-posted on the EQ boards, and<br/>\nsummarily ignored by Gordo lo these many months (except for the one time<br/>\nwhere he just picked a few weenie items out and posted on them).  Also, the<br/>\nConcert Hall has been KNOWN and MENTIONED in many posts as the main bardic<br/>\ngathering place, yet he has posted that any place like that doesn&#39;t &quot;truly&quot;<br/>\nrepresent a given community.  Now we have an about-face, and that tells me<br/>\nthat someone above GW&#39;s head got wind of bards being ignored, watched it go<br/>\non for a while, then came down on him.  How else would you explain the<br/>\ninstrument skill caps getting raised so quickly?  That&#39;s a MAJOR balancing<br/>\nissue for this class, yet he tossed out the &quot;it will be in the next patch&quot;<br/>\nphrase as if it happened everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatience my friends... patience.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n---------- Original Message ----------------------------------<br/>\nFrom: Adam Wasserman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Wed, 11 Oct 2000 11:17:01 -0400<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022892.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022892.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;apparently many of our songs are &quot;working as intended&quot; or &quot;may need to be<br/>\n&gt;re-evaluated at some point&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;this may be the end for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;= (<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt;Semi Retired Minstrel<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
