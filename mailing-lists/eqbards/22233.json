Level 40 Nivs Melody of Preservation, which has a spell damage absorbtion component and 2.Level 52 Nillipus&#39; March of Wee, which has a melee damage absorbtion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese 2 songs both have around  15 point damage obsorbtion which, Like in the case of Wee, had about a 15 point damage absorbing component. You would sing the song, but when a person would get hit for more than the  absorbing element, the buff would drop. That made no sense since its a BATTLE buff and really the only person who needed the ac/agil and things IS the person getting HIT. Kinda silly.. Excellent fix.<br/>\n<br/>\nI for one am SOOOOOO looking forward to the 2nd resist being lowered for the Song of Twilight. Maybe its just me but Twilight(level 53) seems to be resisted ALOT more than the already heavily resisted Pixie Strike.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldar Missednote<br/>\nLevel 55( still!)

Is Absor also referring to Psalm<br/>\n  of warmth and cooling?  They have &quot;damage shields&quot;, not damage absorption<br/>\n  shields.  If the Psalms are being nerfed I&#39;ll be pretty pissed... I like<br/>\n  the damage shields.  I would like to assume that Absor is refering to ONLY<br/>\n  damage absorption shields but assuming something that Verant does only<br/>\n  makes and ass out of you and me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -Steve<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 09:31 PM 10/31/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/027658.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/027658.html</a> :<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Absor:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&quot;I have some information about changes we will be making to a few bard<br/>\n  &gt;songs with the next patch.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Songs with a damage shield component will have that component removed.<br/>\n  &gt;Pixie Strike will have its secondary resist reduced.<br/>\n  &gt;Song of Twilight will be singable at any time of the day.
