I was in<br/>\n&gt; the penthouse<br/>\n&gt; in the Aviak city and I had rooks nodding off left and right when<br/>\n&gt; we got in<br/>\n&gt; trouble.  I was the lowest level up there at 18 and was not using any<br/>\n&gt; instruments.  The sleeping rooks would occasionally wake up swing<br/>\n&gt; at me then<br/>\n&gt; nod back off.  I just had to be sure I told the others to leave<br/>\n&gt; them alone and<br/>\n&gt; let them sleep.  The rooks were red to me.  At one time we had a<br/>\n&gt; Harrier that<br/>\n&gt; we were attacking and 2 sleeping rooks.  Sure sounds to me like<br/>\n&gt; it is working<br/>\n&gt; properly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Katawn 18th Season Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt;   Mithaniel Marr Server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
