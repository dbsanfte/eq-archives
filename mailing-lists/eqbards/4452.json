It certainly upgrades the bard on the<br/>\nlist, but I&#39;ve been unable to use either consistently to pull<br/>\na frenzied mob off of someone.  Of course it could just be a<br/>\nrandom chance of clearing the list - the enchanter&#39;s mesmerize<br/>\nis supposed to work like that (95% chance of also doing a<br/>\nmemory blur).&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also my experience.  It does not seem that lullaby clears the hate<br/>\nlist.  It does move you up on the list, often times to the top of the list,<br/>\nbut does not appear to clear it.  Consonant Chains works well in this regard<br/>\ntoo.  It usually causes the mob to target me *even when the song does not<br/>\ntake hold*.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have hand-to-hand up to 100 now (is it capped?  I hope not!).  The most I<br/>\nremember hitting a mob of my level for is 5 points.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have received numerous tells from other bards asking me how I got my brass<br/>\nskill up.  Some of them have heard or thought of going to Arena to play DDD<br/>\novernight, some have not. I still don&#39;t have it maxed, but I got it over 100<br/>\nkilling rats and bats and beetles in the newby zones (which seemed to<br/>\nalternativly entertain or enfuriate newbies--even though I left the loot for<br/>\nthem).  I am playing DDD a lot more recently.  Hopefully I will be able to<br/>\nget it maxed in real battles from this point on.  I like to twist it with<br/>\nChords and Chains.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was in CB last night to replace my Dragoon Dirk and decided I always<br/>\nwanted a little wood elf slave girl pet.  I am taking a break from being an<br/>\nexperience junky for a few days.  I just completed a vacation trip to kill a<br/>\nbunch of folks that I owed payback to (Mr. Griffin, Mr Sand Giant, Mr. Hill<br/>\nGiant, Froon and Choon, Ogre Village, Dorn, Dvinn and I still con that<br/>\nSandwhipserer Wench as red!) and trying to figure out where to go next.  Any<br/>\nopinions as to where I should go for experience at 33?  I tried Solusek A,<br/>\nbut that was a little too low.  I will probably try Solusek B next.  Is<br/>\nlower guk appropriate at this level?  Anywhere else?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcissus of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\nDrawing is held each week through August 20.
