Release, we still strum a stick, they say we ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-356897128\">Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\n The drum thing bugs me. We said in beta, why do we strum a stick? they<br/>\nsaid, it&#39;s beta we&#39;ll fix it. Release, we still strum a stick, they say we<br/>\nforgot to do the drum. Drum gets likened to the barb shield thing, it&#39;s too<br/>\nbig, maybe we can fix it later. Something like a year later, new lands (and<br/>\nall that modeling) still a stick. Nostrolo&#39;s tamborine gets turned into a<br/>\ntamborine instead of a stick, all drums are still sticks. Give me odds the<br/>\nnext addition and the chance to recitfy the drum thing and avoid the large<br/>\nd/l (cited as a main drawback to fixing) still won&#39;t have a drum. I&#39;ve<br/>\nplayed a bard for 2 years as of next month, and that seems like a damn long<br/>\ntime for something to be outstanding. It says they either don&#39;t care or they<br/>\nare simply unable to deal with the volume of problems they have. Granted I<br/>\nam a perfectionist, and spent 15 years in Nuclear Maintenance to make it<br/>\nworse. We tracked outstanding issues based on severity AND the length of<br/>\ntime the issue was outstanding. The NRC is very interested in cycle times.<br/>\nThe point was long cycle times says the management of the facility was<br/>\nlacking in commitment and efficiency, and would get a plant on the Watch<br/>\nlist as fast as a real incident. Gaming is not nuclear power of course, but<br/>\nthe same indicators apply to any industry.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another topic, I have been in Sebilis the last 2 weekends. My cleric and<br/>\nI either join a group or form one. When no enchanter is available, I have<br/>\nbeen doing the crowd control. My best is to charm one, have it fight the<br/>\nsecond or use the 53 mez. The best I can do is 2 mobs mez&#39;ed. I just don&#39;t<br/>\nseem to have time to get a 3rd effectively. I was actually down to one<br/>\nbubble of mana left at one point, and we were just at bridge 3. The pickup<br/>\nwizard was annoyed that I wasn&#39;t singing clarity the whole time. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe (one bubble on 53)<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
