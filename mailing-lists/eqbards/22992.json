Difficulty of actual play.<br/>\nThere is no other class which even remotely approaches the actual physical<br/>\ndifficulty of play which the bard class presents.  I don&#39;t think bards are<br/>\nadequately recompensed for that aspect of the playability factor; in fact I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it even enters into the equation in Verant&#39;s mind because<br/>\ndespite their claims to the contrary it is quite evident that no one there<br/>\nplays a bard regularly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if all the classes were properly balanced we would see a more<br/>\nbalanced representation of the classes in the overall population.  That is<br/>\nnot the case.  Certain classes so far outnumber others that it is readily<br/>\napparent there must be a reason for it.  Certain other classes, including<br/>\nbards, are so vastly underrepresented that there also must be a reason for<br/>\nthat.  Personal preference would obviously create some variation, but across<br/>\na population as large as this one that variation would not be at the levels<br/>\nwe see now.  Below is just a sample from E&#39;ci that I took in the off-peak<br/>\nhours when I could get some actual numbers.  Note that &#39;Anonymous&#39; will<br/>\nlower the numbers shown for some classes, but typically should be fairly<br/>\nequal for all classes except those with high &quot;request&quot; factors like druids,<br/>\nshamans, enchanters, and clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote these numbers are the averages over 4 nites at around 3am mst.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWarriors\t\t32+\ttoo many to list<br/>\n\tRogues\t\t9.5<br/>\n\tMonks\t\t\t5.5<br/>\n\tRangers\t\t30<br/>\n\tPaladins\t\t27<br/>\n\tShadowknights\t17.5<br/>\n\tBards\t\t\t5<br/>\n\tWizards\t\t19.25<br/>\n\tMagicians\t\t29.75<br/>\n\tNecromancers\t32+\ttoo many to list<br/>\n\tEnchanters\t\t25+\tOne night there were too many to<br/>\nlist<br/>\n\tClerics\t\t31+\tTwo nights there were too many to list<br/>\n\tDruids\t\t32+\ttoo many to list<br/>\n\tShamans\t\t23.75<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith over 600 people on the server this means that either half the<br/>\nserver was \tAnonymous or Roleplaying (Highly unlikely) or those classes<br/>\nwhich were too many \tto list were actually much, much higher than 32 in<br/>\nnumber.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 11, 2001 11:03 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Proposal to change how bard haste songs stack<br/>\nwith enchanter/sham an haste spells<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, I couldn&#39;t agree more!  It has always been my pet peeve to hear people<br/>\nsay those things... I have never played D&D but I hear it was wonderful<br/>\nbecause you could have the &quot;fighter/mage&quot; which I think is what a lot of<br/>\npeople look for.. something that is powerful in every aspect.  Despite<br/>\ngeneral opinion, I really believe that the best part about EQ is class<br/>\nbalance, and I think Verant does a pretty good job.  Sure there are<br/>\nshortcomings and the system isn&#39;t perfect but I think it works well.<br/>\nPeople, by nature, just generally want it ALL :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHalana, 58th Shaman<br/>\nTani, 39th Bard<br/>\nSolusekRo<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, January 11, 2001 10:55 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Proposal to change how bard haste songs stack<br/>\n&gt; with enchanter/sham an haste spells<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I personally think our power is balanced with the other classes as the<br/>\n&gt; game currently exists and any haste stacking would overpower the bard<br/>\n&gt; class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the flaws that I see in a lot of arguments for more <br/>\n&gt; powers is &#39;&#39;in literature<br/>\n&gt; bards have...blah blah blah&#39;&#39;, or &#39;&#39;in history, bards <br/>\n&gt; were....blah blah blah&#39;&#39;, or my<br/>\n&gt; favorite, &#39;&#39;in my vision bards should be able to do....blah <br/>\n&gt; blah blah, the designer<br/>\n&gt; Verant&#39;s vision is obviously wrong&#39;&#39;.
