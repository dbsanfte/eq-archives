Smiting you was a total waste of his mana unless<br/>\nhis smites alone could kill you which he should have known they could not.<br/>\nTry that against a dwarf cleric who knows waht he&#39;s doing and you will die.<br/>\nespecially now that he can root you and you can&#39;t interrupt his healing when<br/>\nhe backs away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is the dwarf cleric in our group, same level as me, has 20% more<br/>\nhit points than I do and a better AC.  He has stamina and strength over 100<br/>\nand an agility and dex of 90 something or near to it.  He can mop the floor<br/>\nwith me in melee despite my having 18 pts more weapon skill than him.  If he<br/>\nheals himself it would be even more of a joke.  The last time we dueled he<br/>\nwas the one left with two bubbles while I was near death.  Thank goodness<br/>\nhe&#39;s on my side is all I have to say!  If he was a dwarf Paladin it would be<br/>\neven more laughable, I doubt he would drop below 3 bubbles.  His dwarf<br/>\npaladin that is 5 levels below me has more hp than I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the main problem is that while Verant originally intended a high<br/>\nagility to compensate for low hit points that the lower stamina gives you,<br/>\nthey got burned by someone with super-agility being unhittable and reduced<br/>\nthe agility benefit.  My sole saving grace is I get hit less often than he<br/>\ndoes even with a worse AC because I dodge more, even though our dodge skill<br/>\nis only 5 points different.  Now if they gave wood elves a defense bonus to<br/>\ncompensate for the low hit points maybe it would even out, but right now I<br/>\ncan&#39;t do enough more damage, even with dual wield, to account for his<br/>\ngreater hit points.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: jay schultze [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 28, 1999 9:00 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bards vs Clerics in melee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;jay schultze&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My point is that a class whose specialty is supposed to be<br/>\n&gt;healing is better at combat than we are.  I suppose you could<br/>\n&gt;argue that we&#39;re not supposed to be very good at combat<br/>\n&gt;either, but still I&#39;d like to be better than the class whose<br/>\n&gt;purpose is anti-killing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, i haven&#39;t been keeping up with the list as of late so i hope i posting<br/>\n<br/>\nin the right context here.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric vs Bard melee should DEFINITELY be a NON-Issue (especially after 17th<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel). Beside the fact that Clerics skill is inherently (sp?) low, <br/>\nsomething like 3 or 4 points per level toward blunt skills, which is <br/>\ncomparable to a caster, I have personally meleed a cleric in a duel and <br/>\nfound it laughable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI walked up to Nektulos zone in E Commons to find a Dark Elf Cleric <br/>\nharrassing a friend of mine. He was 20th level as was I, my friend was 16th <br/>\nlevel. He kept challenging her to a duel, but she wouldn&#39;t accept so I <br/>\ndueled him for her. He smited me down to 2 bubbles of hp before he was oom, <br/>\nafter which i proceeded to rape him in melee (he was full health at the time<br/>\n<br/>\nhe went oom). He zoned out almost dead; I still had 2 bubbles hp. I was not <br/>\ntwinked either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad, Follower of Quellious<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 47th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
