What would happen is first<br/>\nall the other players on the boat would disappear then you&#39;d get dumped...<br/>\nThe first time I was back on the dock in BB then next time on the boat on<br/>\nthe way to BB and then finally on the boat on the way to Freeport.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;    The reason I bring it up here - is that several whiny players claimed<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that the cause of the crash is bards playing songs on the boat...  The first<br/>\ntime I was in fact playing a song and thought that it might contribute.  The<br/>\nsecond time - no bards were playing (assuming no one in the hold was) and it<br/>\ncrashed anyways.  I think this was true the third dump as well.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;    So I am wondering if people have any experience in this.  My gut is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that there is no relation between the two - and this is yet another myth<br/>\n(like all bard songs will require mana!)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Slyde of Xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
