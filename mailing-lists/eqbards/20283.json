Hang out at the gobbie caves<br/>\nfor the first 2 levels (no one is ever camping the back entrance), then move<br/>\nover to the Sarnak fortress.  There is a little plataeu not far from where<br/>\nthe path runs out that is *perfect* for pulling to.<br/>\n<br/>\n33-35  Lots of places.  One of the best places I&#39;ve found is getting into a<br/>\ngiant group at the FV giant camps.
