With a combine longsword (delay<br/>\n28), I swing 5 times in roughly 14.0 seconds.  This is<br/>\nconsistent with my previous findings that the weapon delay is<br/>\njust the recycle time in tenths of seconds (so 28 delay means<br/>\n2.8 seconds between swings).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith only the whistling warsong playing, it dropped to about<br/>\n12.5 seconds, or about 25 delay (so my combine longsword is<br/>\nworking like a well-balanced longsword :-).  Roughly a 10%<br/>\nspeedup (my bard is L15).  With only the anthem playing, it<br/>\nwas about 12.5 seconds, maybe 13.0 seconds (my stopwatch<br/>\nresults for this one had about a half second of scatter).  So<br/>\nagain the speedup is about 10%, maybe a hair slower than the<br/>\nwarsong.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying both whistling warsong and the anthem, I got 12.5<br/>\nseconds again.  Apparently, the attack speedup with these two<br/>\ndoes not stack, although the strength bonus does.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
