Yes, some of the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>buffs<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; last longer but if I&quot;m debuffing during the fight, and I am even needed to<br/>\n&gt; SLIGHTLY heal, i&#39;m the one holding the group up.  In fact, it is nearly<br/>\n&gt; impossible for me to keep FULL buffs up on my groups unless that&#39;s about<br/>\n </span></blockquote>all<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Let&#39;s put it this way:  Once you buff those two people and you are oom<br/>\n  you don&#39;t have to buff them for over an hour.  If you are doing full<br/>\n  buffs, then chances are you are not the primary healer.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My buff lasts a whopping 6 secs.  And is half the power of yours.<br/>\n  That&#39;s ridiculous.  Not only does it last 1/600th of the time<br/>\n  but it does 1/2 the boost.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our party songs should exceed any other player class buffs for<br/>\n  the pure reason that they are extremely temporary.  Well that&#39;s<br/>\n  my reasoning.  It may not be 100% correct, but sheeeit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
