Definitely<br/>\nwearable for a druid.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat level are Cobalt Drakes?  I&#39;ve never seen one but would assume they are<br/>\nfound in Cobalt Scar, which is a 50+ zone.  This is a prime example of how<br/>\nscrewed up tradeskills are in EQ.  In order to tailor this item, you have to<br/>\nbe in a 50+ group to kill the mob that drops the components.  The item that<br/>\nyou can craft from the components is nice but not good enough to replace the<br/>\nitems a 50+ character most likely already has.  So basically the only people<br/>\nwho could use them are twinks or true newbies.  Would be nice if 50+ mobs<br/>\ndropped items which could be used by blacksmiths/tailors to craft items<br/>\nappropriate for 50+ characters.  Thats how tradeskills in UO work and how<br/>\nthey are supposed to work in UO2 and DAoC.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
