At first people<br/>\nthought it raised your minimum damage by that amount, but another test I<br/>\nsaw showed that it increased the damage stat of the weapon.  I think<br/>\nsomeone at a low level with a 6/30 +1 Undead weapon would hit for max 13<br/>\nagainst normal mobs but max 15 against skels.  Small test but follows<br/>\nwhat you said, that fighting Undead with a 10/20 +4 Undead weapon<br/>\nbecomes 14/20.  It is easy to see how Undead or Grimling damage<br/>\nmodifieres work but I do not understand how Fire, Cold, and Magic damage<br/>\nworks.  I would love to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the skill modifiers, it seemed to me that it would add that<br/>\npercentage to your skill in that area while using the item.  If you had<br/>\na meditate skill of 200 and were wearing a +5% meditate item, your skill<br/>\nwould work as if it was 210.  Again, just a thought.  If that is the<br/>\ncase, I wonder if it goes above the cap for that skill.  If not, they<br/>\nwould be pretty worthless if that is how they work, since everyone at 60<br/>\nmost likely has their skills maxxed anyway.  If they work differently,<br/>\nsuch as you said just adding 5% damage with that weapon or medding 5%<br/>\nfaster without actually having to add skill points, then the higher-end<br/>\nones seem pretty powerful.  It is a neat way to add to your class<br/>\nwithout just getting new items or AA skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t play anymore so this could all be completely off hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nygaard, Jeff [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff.nygaard@...\">jeff.nygaard@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 14, 2001 6:57 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Questions about the new attributes on some new SoL<br/>\nweapons<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I sent this to several of the EQ Yahoo group I belong to in hopes<br/>\nsomeone will know the answer. With the release of SoL and all the new<br/>\narmor<br/>\nand weapons, there are many new attributes given to weapons. I have<br/>\nlisted a<br/>\nfew weapons below. Some of the new weapons have various damage<br/>\nattributes<br/>\ngiven to some weapons. I have seen lots of different types. Some of that<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen are Fire Damage, Magic Damage,  Undead Bane Damage, Cold<br/>\nDamage,<br/>\nGrimling Bane Damage and many others I am sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know how these weapon will work? What kind of impact will<br/>\nthese<br/>\nmodifications have on the damage output? Does a 10 damage 20 delay with<br/>\na 4<br/>\ndamage undead turn into a 14 damage 20 delay verses undead mobs? I am<br/>\nsure<br/>\nthis can&#39;t be true, but I&#39;d sure like to know how this works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, other weapons are popping up with skill type bonuses. For example,<br/>\nI<br/>\nsaw a 2 hand blunt weapon that had a + 5 % to 2 hand blunt. Now does<br/>\nthis 5%<br/>\ngo to your 2 hand blunt skill? Or is it that you will hit for 5% more<br/>\ndamage. How does this work. I also saw an item that had 3% lock picking<br/>\nskill gloves, a HtH held item that gave like 2% hand to hand. I am sure<br/>\nthere are a lot more of these to be found.<br/>\n<br/>\nI f anyone has any thought or knowledge on how these attributes affect<br/>\nthe<br/>\nplayer, please post. I hope this was not too confusing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
