We could then post these<br/>\nsuggestions on the EQ forum notice boards and prehaps Verant will consider<br/>\nthese as ideas for our missing songs (or for the update). I think if it was<br/>\na formal post that has come from this list it may be taken seriously. The<br/>\npost would not be a rant just a suggestion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion for songs would be:<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 39: Invis to Undead (useful in Lower guk etc)<br/>\nLevel 45: An upgraded Bellow/DD song (giving us better combat skills)<br/>\nLevel 47: Summon Corpse song (like the necro one)<br/>\nLevel 49: Upgraded older song (such as charm) or a combo song (2 effects<br/>\nsuch as hymm and clarity)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few suggestions, I would like to hear everyone suggestions and<br/>\nprehaps the best ones could be posted on EQ boards to get Verant moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 38 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
