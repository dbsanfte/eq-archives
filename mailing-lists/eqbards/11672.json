I&#39;d agree with everything you said below<br/>\nexcept that there is no iterative effect on Lullaby.  I tested it for over<br/>\nan hour of straight and the % of false nods did not decrease over time.  It<br/>\nappears they have some sort of ignore mez code built in in order to reduce<br/>\nits effectiveness against higher level creatures.
