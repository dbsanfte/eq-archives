There is most<br/>\n&gt; definatly some bard aggro bugwhich can occur in seemingly any zone.  I<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; personally experienced this super aggro in butcherblock, oasis, and<br/>\n&gt; unrest.<br/>\n&gt; When I was in oasis, orcs were barelling over the dunes to find me, you<br/>\n&gt; can see<br/>\n&gt; quite a ways in oasis so I would see several dark forms off in the<br/>\n&gt; distance<br/>\n&gt; beelining for me and when they got close, hey 5-6 orcs all over. What joy!<br/>\n&gt; Thank Erollisi for Selo&#39;s (the biggest lifesaver of them all)  This has<br/>\n&gt; happened<br/>\n&gt; to me in those other zones as well... for no apparent reason, no group<br/>\n&gt; attacking<br/>\n&gt; anything like you suggest, things come out f the woodworks and ignore the<br/>\n&gt; medding nukers and beeline for the bard.  Its disgustingly insane, even<br/>\n&gt; when we<br/>\n&gt; have to zone to clear the faction list.<br/>\n&gt; *sigh*<br/>\n&gt; JM, Care to comment?<br/>\n&gt; Penaden Songweaver<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lostorder.com\">http://www.lostorder.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmmm, bards have the rep for being monster magnets.  But you prolly need<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play your songs no matter what  but not AE (Area Effect).  You dint say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zactly how young you are but the gnolls will go agro on people they see<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; look tasty to them.  they can tell how young you are and will attack you<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they think they can win. As you get older they get smarter and if they<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trival to you they don&#39;t attack.  Unless of course their friends have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whipped them in to a frenzy and they are trying to help - ie you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; started a train.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Selos is not an area effect on NPC&#39;s so it should not matter.  But if<br/>\n&gt; one of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your party had attacked that gnoll and gotten on its hate list - then<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it comes up and see you helping the party - it gets mad at you and<br/>\n&gt; attacks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you play an aera effect - like chords in a place like BB - that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high traffic and multi- level - you will get a LOT of attention real<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quick!!!  So don&#39;t play AE songs in dungeons - as a rule.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard of the 18th level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a.k.a.
