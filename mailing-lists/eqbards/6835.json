At L19 I would have<br/>\nthought that they might be a bit hard to reach, even with a full party.<br/>\nIs this not the case? This dungeon wasn&#39;t even itemized until I was in<br/>\nmy 30&#39;s so I didn&#39;t get to play there much except for a trip to pick up<br/>\na crystalline blade and a couple of aborted Vox attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -----<br/>\n&gt; To add to the stuff about what to wear, i think that (based on stats) the only<br/>\n&gt; Bronze worth wearing are the 3 pieces listed above.  All the other pieces are<br/>\n&gt; just 1 point better than Banded (i think) and REALLY HEAVY.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThey do, however, make a big difference, according to what I&#39;ve heard.<br/>\nWasn&#39;t it on this list where someone said they definately knew that<br/>\ndifferent armor types provided different protection, independent of the<br/>\nAC value? I remember someone saying a Programmer GM had grabbed him or a<br/>\nfriend in beta and equipped him in various armor to test this.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few other sources of medium bronze I&#39;ve heard are, Guards in HighPass<br/>\nand some mobs in Mistmoore.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, the point still stands that medium bronze is totally<br/>\nunattainable by characters off mobs at anywhere close to the level that<br/>\nsmall bronze is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y* </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
