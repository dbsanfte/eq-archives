In beta, if you kill a gnoll pup you got +1 to the<br/>\n&gt; guards of qeynos.  However, if you killed a good guard you got -50<br/>\n&gt; to the guards of qeynos.  You would have to kill 50 gnolls to make<br/>\n&gt; up for one qeynos guard.  So factions vary in intensity everywhere,<br/>\n&gt; which doesn&#39;t click with a lot of people.  They see one message, and<br/>\n&gt; think they&#39;ve taken -1 or +1 hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know, it would be a bit out of &quot;character&quot; to have this, but I<br/>\nthink it would be very nice indeed if Verant would give you some<br/>\nkind of level indication (other than the 5 or 6 &#39;general&#39; ideas)<br/>\nas to where you stand with faction. As you said above, faction<br/>\nplays an incredible amount into how you end up playing this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, my high elf cleric mainly resides in Freeport<br/>\nright now. I&#39;m dubious to the guards. I have no idea why. My wife<br/>\nis the same race/class and she&#39;s indifferent. We&#39;ve always <br/>\ntravelled together and have done the same quests, killed the <br/>\nsame mob&#39;s, etc. My bard killed the spy in the FP bank once and<br/>\nis now dubious to the militia as well. (Even though I&#39;ve<br/>\nslaughtered orcs all around Norrath by the gabillions)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to top it off.. has anyone even found a way anymore,<br/>\nshort of killing the guards in North Freeport, to raise your<br/>\nfaction with the militia? I have yet to find a safe way to get<br/>\nthrough the sewers in either West/East freeport to North<br/>\nFreeport so if somehow I get to threateningly or ready to <br/>\nslaughter - how do I get to my guild in N.Freeport? It&#39;d be a<br/>\nshame to have to avoid Freeport for the rest of my character&#39;s<br/>\nplaying days since it happens to be the best place to practice<br/>\nthose ever so useless trade skills I maintain.. (grin)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Freeport Militia faction is too sensitive in my opinion.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
