I couldn&#39;t care less if the items along the way<br/>\nin the quest were &#39;no drop&#39; because I plan on keeping them to complete the<br/>\nquest anyhow.  Having the reward be &#39;no drop&#39; and incredibly restricted in<br/>\nits usability just makes quests less worthwhile.  From what I have seen very<br/>\nfew people do quests anyhow so I doubt this would break any item rarity<br/>\novermuch.  I even traded a Shining Star of Light to a 38th level cleric from<br/>\nQeynos who could easily have done the quest but didn&#39;t want to lose valuable<br/>\ncamping time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: David Knadler [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 02, 1999 3:44 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Undead drops in Kithicor<br/>\nImportance: Low<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: David Knadler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Personally I also hate letting items go to waste, but it at least fits<br/>\n&gt; in with Verant&#39;s appearant philosophy of keeping items rare <br/>\n&gt; by any means<br/>\n&gt; possible. If they didn&#39;t have the items no drop, they&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; probably cut the<br/>\n&gt; spawn of items even more to assure that everyone didn&#39;t have one.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I also think they implemented the &quot;NO DROP&quot; flag to minimize the amount of<br/>\n&quot;farming&quot; & &quot;harvesting&quot; of items.  Without it, you know that there would be<br/>\npeople camping quest item spawns and then attempting to sell the items.  &quot;NO<br/>\nDROP&quot; isn&#39;t the perfect solution, but I consider it to be the lesser of two<br/>\nevils.  In fact, from what I understand of the game mechanics I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthey could come up with an ideal solution without a major overhaul of the<br/>\nentire system.  Also, in a FRPG milieu, it makes perfect sense to keep<br/>\ncertain items rare and unique - unfortunately, most people consider it their<br/>\nbirthright to eventually own these particular items simply because they<br/>\nexist - and they&#39;ll go to great lengths to obtain them.  If every rare item<br/>\nwas dropped all the time, it would just be a matter of time before everyone<br/>\nin the game had the best equipment (for their class) with little regard for<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
