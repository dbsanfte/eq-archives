When the mobs got down to 1/3 to 1/4 life, I&#39;d <br/>\nswitch to bellows and warsong (if my health was okay)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Partying:<br/>\n<br/>\nMelee:<br/>\nI would take preferance to singing Anthem, and switch to healing (and step <br/>\nback from the fight to avoid the shit list effect) with my mandolin.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting magic users:<br/>\nI would sing/twist the rhythm songs (to boost resistances) and anthem.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
