If your group has one of these individuals, it&#39;s probably a good<br/>\nidea to bail:<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE LOOT HOUND -- &quot;Whoops!  I didn&#39;t mean to loot that.  Only 5sp, anyway<br/>\nhehe.&quot;  Once is acceptable (I&#39;ve accidentally looted more times than I can<br/>\ncount trying to whip around with mouselook).  If it&#39;s a pattern, watch out!<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE NINJA LOOTER -- Loot hound&#39;s deadly older brother.  Hard to spot who is<br/>\ndoing it, but if corpses are disappearing during battle, get out quick.  Not<br/>\nonly is this person stealing loot from the group, they are doing it instead of<br/>\nhelping fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAFK -- Person goes afk and sits off in a corner for long periods of time,<br/>\ngaining free xp while they get a snack.  Close cousin: BRB, who runs off to<br/>\nsell and takes a enormous amount of time, but doesn&#39;t realise their spot in<br/>\nthe group, insisting they&#39;ll &quot;come right back!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSHOWOFF -- &quot;I&#39;ll just solo this mob, you all take the rest!&quot; 5 seconds later:<br/>\n&quot;Ack!  Help!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE MANABURNER -- If your party has just killed a lone low blue and somebody<br/>\ngives the &quot;OOM&quot; message, hit that disband button.  Second cousin: the nuking<br/>\ncleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nJOHNNY CAN&#39;T READ -- If you have to keep telling somebody something (&quot;Don&#39;t<br/>\nattack mezzed mobs,&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t try to pull a &#39;single&#39; from that train,&quot; etc),<br/>\nthey are never going to listen.<br/>\n<br/>\nDANCING CASTER -- They yell &quot;On me&quot; and start shuffling around the room,<br/>\nmaking it impossible to get the mob off.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE SECOND PULLER -- If you hear more than one &quot;INC&quot; head immediately to the<br/>\nzone, disband, and find another group.  Better than dying horribly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE JIG JUNKIE -- Asks you to play Jig of Vigor to increase mana.  If they are<br/>\nthis stupid, they are going to be doing a lot of other stupid things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other 5% of bad groups consist of all competant people, but the mix is<br/>\njust wrong for the mob and/or area.  Nobody is doing anything wrong, and it&#39;s<br/>\nhard to put your finger on where the foulup is.  Best way to spot a group like<br/>\nthis is if one person keeps dying with everybody else at full health.  That<br/>\nshould NEVER happen, even to a bard, in a good group.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
