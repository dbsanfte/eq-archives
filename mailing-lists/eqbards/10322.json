He is one of <br/>\nthe most knowledgable players I have every met in the game.  The upcoming <br/>\nnerf to Feign Death will effect all players, not just Monks, Shadow Knights, <br/>\nand Necros.<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nI would like to provide the community with information so they can <br/>\nunderstand the nature of Verant&#39;s changes to FD. The changes are <br/>\nsignificant, a nerf, and their news message was misleading.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you were within sight, they would immediately come after you.&quot; - No, <br/>\nthey came back based on aggro radius. If you saw them wander away to a safe <br/>\ndistance, you could get up without training anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If not, they would come after you at some later point. This might happen <br/>\nwithin a few minutes, or could happen even a few hours later&quot; - This was not <br/>\nrandom, but the result of game mechanics understood by experienced feigners. <br/>\nA feigned upon mob has you in its aggro list. If someone else re-aggros the <br/>\nmob to a lesser degree than the original feigner, it will return to the <br/>\nfeigner. Feigners knew this! If the mobs were in front of them in a room, <br/>\nthey knew no one would disturb them and all was fine. If the mobs were <br/>\nscattered around the dungeon by a train wandering home, they knew to zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;.... Four times means about 20 percent ....&quot; - These numbers seem totally <br/>\ninaccurate. I had to feign 11 times on a green guard and 10 times on a <br/>\nknight while testing in Freeport. If ANY of your feign attempts fails (xxxx <br/>\nhas fallen to the ground) then the mob comes running back. NO OTHER SKILL <br/>\ntakes 4 or more successful skill checks in a row to perform a single act. If <br/>\nyou have multiple mobs, it is almost impossible to fool them all. If even <br/>\none is not fooled, it will build a train as it runs to you - quite possibly <br/>\nfrom so far out of sight that you don&#39;t even know you are killing other <br/>\nplayers.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeign used to be predictable. If you were successful against a mob that can <br/>\nbe fooled (some couldn&#39;t be - this was a matter of experience and feigners <br/>\nknew which mobs to avoid), it would never come back unless re-aggroed by <br/>\nanother player. Verant implies otherwise, but it is NOW that the skill is <br/>\ntotally unpredictable, with mobs that are far out of sight deep in the <br/>\ndungeon randomly returning, based on percentages apparently much worse than <br/>\nthose Verant gave and which are useless against multiple mobs. Stand up, and <br/>\na feigner doesn&#39;t know if he is killing people far out of sight, or has <br/>\nsafely cleared aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore a player had to re-aggro a mob in such a way that the feigner was <br/>\nstill higher on its aggro list (such as by coming very close, but doing no <br/>\ndamage), and in this case it was usually only the feigner that was in <br/>\ndanger. Now every time a feigner stands up mobs can come training from <br/>\neverywhere, and if he feigns again because he sees them coming, they will <br/>\nattack anyone nearby or in their path home.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeign pulling is still possible, although harder. Feign twinking/leveling <br/>\nothers is still possible, and should actually be easier. Feigning to avoid <br/>\ndeath or trains now results in far more trains. What are these &quot;evolving <br/>\ngameplay issues&quot; that Verant hoped to address? In what way was this supposed <br/>\nto make this a better game?<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask that the EQ community understand this is not just a nerf to SKs, <br/>\nNecromancers, and Monks, but to anyone that has ever grouped with them or <br/>\neven played in a dungeon, and invite you to provide /feedback in game to <br/>\nvoice your opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for listening, Yeti (Level 50 monk, Karana server)<br/>\n*********************************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
