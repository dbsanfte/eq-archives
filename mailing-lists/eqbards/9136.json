Sometimes the pulse messages appear twice per pulse, also (healing <br/>\ncomes to mind).  Are these songs cancelling or adding or neither?

Constant 15% to 35%, surges and spikes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;into red with 50% to 80%.  Other players all complaing.  Some guys getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dumped and coming back only to be nekkid and bind spot - never seeing a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So, rather than venture into some hard dungeon, I was helping a group do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;HG&#39;s off the wood bridge in North Karanas.  Staying back, buffing and mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;song.  So, then I decide ok, let&#39;s try Denons with horn and see how he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;likes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it.  Great - he&#39;s wincing away nicely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Then my friend Kaldivar comes by and asks about fenne&#39;s and charms.  So, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;say follow me I can show you a Grifxxxx spawn spot - do you know where the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;named treeant is? (By now you should have a pretty good idea of what is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;coming next.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On the way there, I cant get selo&#39;s to lock and stay up.  I click, it trys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;then stops.  I start whining about lag and how weird this is a cant make my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;songs play, etc. etc. Just as we get to that little tower, I look up and go<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;hmmm, wonder why the tree is moving around like that?&quot;  Followed shortly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;you are burned&quot; and whoof 2 plus bubs of hp dissappear.  Btw: Kaldivar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;says<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;oh I dunno, he is red to me&quot; Hehe - I start running away and frantically<br/>\n&gt; &gt;yelling &quot;ZNE, ZNME, ZONE!!&quot;  You are burned. Another 2 bubs gone and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;glimpse of the goodie werewolf hunter chasing me as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Now I am keying and clicking Selos very, very fast and desparately trying<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for a zone.  Praise the Gods!  It finally stuck and I escaped to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Western<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Karana.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So, all I can think of is Denons was locked on - due to some lag bug? Selos<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would not start and since there is no icon and were no other mobs being hit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- there was no screen message to see.  But seems even wierder than that.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;scrolled back to see what spell he was casting and do not recall seeing &quot;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Xannthoulos winces&quot; message.  Not that is some strong &quot;bard hate&quot; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that likes you attacks you!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;After a bit, the lag seemed to settle enough so I went and helped my group<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kill spectres.  Even with 3 and 4 of them getting pulled, it seemed almost<br/>\n&gt; &gt;too easy.  Of course we did have an enchanter handling the crowd control.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;She could park them as necessary while we feared (although not the bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fear) and killed the others.  Hehe, spectres are too easy.  Never thought I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would be saying that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bard of the 34th song<br/>\n&gt; &gt;somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
