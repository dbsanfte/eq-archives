It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked players <br/>\nbecause obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our <br/>\nbehinds off for what we have, but also because I feel they&#39;re missing out <br/>\nin part of the game completely. I felt great when I was able to afford <br/>\nbuying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that <br/>\nuntil after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with pieces <br/>\n(or complete sets) of plate armor. If someone offered me a set of plate <br/>\nwould I accept it? Nope. It would totally take away from the game that I <br/>\nplay. If someone offered me a little something for a favor I did them - <br/>\nsure I&#39;d take it. But not if it was way out of bounds for the favor. It&#39;s <br/>\nnot a matter of pride or passing up a great offer - it&#39;s about making the <br/>\nmost out of EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwinked players are missing out on so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I never did understand people who paid $49.95 for Diablo, then<br/>\n&gt;immediately hacked themselves 50th level characters.  If you<br/>\n&gt;sell the crown and buy yourself full bronze armor, a barbed<br/>\n&gt;whip, and dragoon dirk, I predict you will be very very bored<br/>\n&gt;for the next 10-15 levels because the only thing you&#39;ll have<br/>\n&gt;to look forward to is leveling.  Just about everything dropped<br/>\n&gt;by stuff you fight until you reach about level 25 is going to<br/>\n&gt;be inferior to the equipment you bought at level 13. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
