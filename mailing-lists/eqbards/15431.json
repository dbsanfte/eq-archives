Nonstop high level lizards. The entrance to lower guk<br/>\nlive side would be good too. Frogs on either side of the zone line would<br/>\ngive good exp. Even the top of Sol B by the Sol A zone would be good but<br/>\nI&#39;d hold off on Sol B until you have to go there, you&#39;ll be tired of it<br/>\nsoon enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Feb 24/00, &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Was wondering if there is a good place for me to solo at 35th level?  Spent<br/>\n&gt; four hours in Sol A last night in a party and killed a ton of blue goblins.<br/>\n&gt; I got maybe 3/4 bar of EXP.  The camp was safe but actually pretty boring.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m willing to take a risk soloing if it will help me get out of 35th.   I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; thinking about the only place for me to solo at 35 is Rathe Mtns charming<br/>\n&gt; giants against one another.  Anyone got a better suggestion.  Would it just<br/>\n&gt; be better to join a group in one of the dungeons or kill ogre bouncers?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Shop the web for great deals.
