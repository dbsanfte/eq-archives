Here are<br/>\nsome of my bardic thoughts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA:  (Spoiler) The quest from Vahlen Nostrolo does not seem to yeild the<br/>\nLevel 30 song.  I have completed this quest twice, both times at 16th<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\nThe first time a non-bard group member gave Nostrolo the items he needs.<br/>\nIn<br/>\nreturn he got Chords of Dissonance, the second level Song.  When I<br/>\ncompleted<br/>\nthe quest again on my own I recieved the Locating Lyric the 4th level song.<br/>\nIt is concievable that a 30th level Bard completing this quest may get the<br/>\nsong, but It seems unlikely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nB:  I was wondering about the instrument pieces.  I have asked many bards<br/>\nif<br/>\nthey were able to assemble them to make a Lute or a trumpet or something<br/>\nand<br/>\nnever recieved an affirmative.  I had an idea that a Gnomes Tinker Skill<br/>\nmay<br/>\nbe able to be used to put the pieces together.  I talked to one Gnome who<br/>\nthought it might work, but have not found a Gnome and tried it yet.  Gnomes<br/>\nget tinker at level 16.  But this might be a way to assemble a trumpet or<br/>\nperhaps an enhanced Lute.  Of course it is likely to just produce a normal<br/>\nLute one can buy in a store.  If anyone actually does assemble these pieces<br/>\nplease let us know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nC:  Often when I play my songs my music sounds very strange.  I was<br/>\nwondering if any others have experienced this.  It definately sounds as if<br/>\nmy Mandolin is out of tune, which would give credence to the usefullness of<br/>\nLute Tuners.  But the effects still seem to work full power.  When I ask my<br/>\ngroupmates if they hear any strange sounding music none has ever had their<br/>\nsound enabled.  I am just wondering if other bards have heard this or if it<br/>\nis just a sound problem with my Machine.  I have no other sound problems<br/>\nand<br/>\nthe music sounds exactly like a mis-tuned instrument so I was wondering if<br/>\nthis is a feature of the game telling me to buy a new Mandolin or<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nD:  As others have mentioned set up your hotkeys for quick instrument<br/>\nSwitching.  It shall make you a much better bard for your group and<br/>\nyourself.  The melee weapon slots and general slots can be turned into<br/>\nbuttons and dragged onto a blank hot key.  Takes about 5 blanks to set it<br/>\nup<br/>\nnice for easy switching.  Doing this means you shall never have to pop up<br/>\nthe inventory screen to switch instruments.  MAkes it trivial to switch to<br/>\nMandolin for healing even half a bubble worth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nE:  Buy  songs in advance.  The songs we get are scattered all over.  Buy<br/>\nthe songs only available in your city levels in advance before you leave to<br/>\ngo get new songs.  Just store them in the bank.  This makes it so you do<br/>\nnot<br/>\nhave to travel back to Kelethin or Erudin to get your song.  Plan in<br/>\nAdvance, it is not that hard to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nF:  The 14th Identify (Catalogue) song is not that useful as we know.<br/>\nBefore it was changed in the last patch though it did give me one piece of<br/>\ninformation out of all the times I have used it.  When I identified a<br/>\nGriffon Feather it had a listing of <br/>\nSkill:  Archery<br/>\nI found this interesting.  I am not a fletcher, but perhaps Griffon<br/>\nfeathers<br/>\ncan be used somehow.  I have no idea, besides the clue given with the<br/>\nIdentify.  After this weeks patch though the Identify song gives even less<br/>\ninformation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBards Rule.  Good Luck All.  <br/>\n<br/>\nProsper,<br/>\nRADIA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your free, private email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.excite.com/\">http://mail.excite.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
