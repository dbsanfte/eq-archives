This started with me stealing from a<br/>\n&gt;third player.  The Wizard jumped in and , after making her chase me to<br/>\n&gt;Kithicore, I more or less conceded defeat.  But the wizard didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt;end the game yet so she accused me of stealing from her too.  It&#39;s all in<br/>\n&gt;the name of fun and she&#39;s been VERY sportsmanlike about bending the rules<br/>\n&gt;of EQ to allow a few of my moves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think I&#39;ll shoot the arrow at the skeleton just before Immobilize wears<br/>\n&gt;off.  Then run for the zone.  If she allows the move, the skeleton will<br/>\n&gt;eventually fall back and forget about me, but it will be in her path as she<br/>\n&gt;chases me.
