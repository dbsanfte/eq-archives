Late<br/>\n&gt;30&#39;s/lo 40&#39;s I wanted more damage and figured out Obsidian Shard with 30dd<br/>\n&gt;proc is off had wield-able so I set forth trying to get one.  I was with a<br/>\n&gt;group (later to become my guild) and turned down a runed falchion.  They<br/>\n&gt;must have been kinda astounded when I told them my StoW and Obsid Shard is<br/>\n&gt;better than RF and whatever in off hand.  Heh, some 40 minutes later they<br/>\n&gt;ported me off some where and presented me with an Obsidan Shard. I presume<br/>\n&gt;they did some trading with the RF or whatever.  That was a good combo for<br/>\n&gt;me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lo to mid 40&#39;s I became 2YK compliant.

But also low damage, a 12 here, a 16 there, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s it.  So maybe I should be looking to improve on them, to give<br/>\n&gt;&gt; me a feeling I&#39;m doing more than nibbling.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m hoping to hear from everyone else what weapons you are using,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and how you feel they compare to what I&#39;ve got and to what other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; supposed (phooey!) hybrids are doing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
