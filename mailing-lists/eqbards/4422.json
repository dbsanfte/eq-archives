As","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-66929260\">This is for the gentleman who asked that I explain what I meant by the<br/>\n&quot;linkdead flag&quot; that is set on your character upon becoming charmed or<br/>\nfeared.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone pointed out, when your character is charmed or feared in a PvP<br/>\nenvironment, the level limit for pvp disappears, and if you do a /who you<br/>\nwill see that the person has &lt;LINKDEAD&gt; next to their name.  This tactic is<br/>\noften used in Rallos Zek by unsavory types to kill PC they might not<br/>\nnormally be able to kill(the same types of people as our good friend<br/>\nSilverios who, upon getting the disarm skill, proceeded to walk around in<br/>\nevery dungeon disarming everone she saw).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Tallon Zek, the race war server, bards and enchanters will own when all<br/>\nis said and done at lv 50, least until christmas&#39; expansion.  There are two<br/>\nprimary tactics that will prove deadly in pvp.  First, you can charm/make<br/>\nthem attack a high level mob, and then zone.  When you&#39;re wiped off of the<br/>\nhatelist all that is left is your pet and the mob, and the mob will not stop<br/>\nattacking the PC.  Second, there&#39;s the fear, chains combo, in which the PC<br/>\nis entirely helpless as they walk slowly around the zone while you whack<br/>\nthem from behind.  I was talking to a friend the other day that said the<br/>\nanti magical aura song (lv 40+ i think) does some AMAZING things to PC spell<br/>\ncasters.  I&#39;m not too sure the legitimacy of this claim, but if it&#39;s true,<br/>\nthat will put us over the top as pvp gods.  And of course there&#39;s other<br/>\ntactics, but none so devastating as the ones previously mentioned (unless<br/>\nsomeone can think of any, and I would be thrilled to hear of any more).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
