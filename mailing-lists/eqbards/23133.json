The shield is a 9 pt shield that doesn&#39;t stack with thorn type shields, but still stacks with ours.  It lasts about 5 minutes (about a fight and a half : ), and has about a 5 second casting time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I&#39;ve noticed on Bards and using items....&#39;cause we&#39;re bards we can activate items while moving etc, but I can&#39;t find a way for us to interupt the casting on an item (the others in my guild just move, crouch, or sit and it interrupts them...but none of those work for us).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, for laughs, go out to third person sometime, and activate an illusion mask, then duck while it&#39;s still casting.  You&#39;ll get a very interesting look :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--Khelan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Robert(Bob)  Smith&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rws1111@...\">rws1111@...</a>&gt; 01/15/01 08:52AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>#2) I have been thinking about trying to get a SS bracer, but really <br/>\ndo not want to put the time in the camp.
