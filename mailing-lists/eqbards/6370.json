Thursday at 2025 EST Hatar<br/>\nspawned behind the docks in Oasis, back near the land based pillar.  The<br/>\nusual screams of &quot;SG!&quot; rang out, but I had SoW on my troll shaman and it was<br/>\npretty close to the zone anyhow... so I ran over to see where he went.  I<br/>\nclicked on him just as everyone started saying &quot;hey... a blue SG...&quot; and saw<br/>\nHatar.  I noted it and thought, wow, nice of him to spawn since we were just<br/>\ntalking about him and gave it little more thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSaturday at 0230 EST the screams rang out and, being the curious little<br/>\ntroll that I am, I went to investigate again.  Sure enough, same place, same<br/>\nSG: Hatar.  FYI, he&#39;s definitely slower compared to the rest of the SGs when<br/>\nrunning so if you happen upon him and have a decent group you might want to<br/>\ngive it a shot since even without sow I&#39;m sure run-jump will beat him out in<br/>\na dash for the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo there, those more inclined to numbers (there may be some other triggers<br/>\nto making him spawn - a group was previously hunting SG&#39;s, but they had left<br/>\na good hour before he spawned) and such can camp him until Brad makes you<br/>\nyield or die. :P<br/>\n<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Sicarius & Scummy @ Veeshan&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Any word if lizardmen are going to be bards?  I mean, we got the scout<br/>\nfife as proof they are into instruments...  Ah who am I kidding, I just want<br/>\na troll bard. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
