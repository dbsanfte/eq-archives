If you&#39;re looking at hit %&#39;s something<br/>\n&gt; to consider is how does the combat formula work with<br/>\n&gt; respect to dodge/parry/riposte?  My presumption is<br/>\n&gt; that A checks for a successfull hit against B, then if<br/>\n&gt; successfull B gets a dodge check, if it fails, a parry<br/>\n&gt; check, if it succeeds a riposte check.
