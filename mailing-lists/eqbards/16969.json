Looks<br/>\nlike 68 per tick which is still great damage (I do<br/>\nabout 14-15 with my barbed leather whip at 14th lvl)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion though -- I recently tried to see how much<br/>\nCOD does during combat.  Disbanded with my best<br/>\nhunting buddy, both us us hit duel and ... COD didn&#39;t<br/>\naffect him at all.  I would play (with mandolin and<br/>\nwithout) and the song would simply end a tick later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat went wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really curious about maxing damage in combat. If<br/>\nCOD only does 2 damage per round, regardless of level<br/>\n(without instrument) then it&#39;s probably only useful<br/>\nbelow 10th lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did use COD a lot at 3rd-12th lvl and,while I had to<br/>\nbe careful, had good results.  At 14th lvl tho, I seem<br/>\nto do better using bellow.
