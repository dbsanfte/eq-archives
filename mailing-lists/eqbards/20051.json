The enchanter can cast Breeze on themself and keep a group of<br/>\n4 mobs that are even cons, mezzed forever.  The resist rate isn&#39;t high<br/>\nenough to give them much trouble since it&#39;s below 10% and the mez lasts<br/>\nlonger than it takes to med back the mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then tried the same tactic with lullaby.  6 greater heals later I gave up.<br/>\nLullaby met with about 40% success on the even cons.  That means it reduced<br/>\ndamage by 40%.  Largo&#39;s reduces damage by 30%, is seldom resisted, and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stop reducing damage when someone smacks the target.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want 90% success.  If it worked 75%of the time on even cons at high<br/>\ncharisma Lullaby would be viable.  Not as good as an enchanter by any means<br/>\nsince it lasts 6 seconds, it&#39;s all you can do if you keep them mezzed other<br/>\nthan swing waking up the one you are hitting.  It doesn&#39;t even begin to make<br/>\nenchanters obsolete.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts duration of one tick should be more than enough to balance it out.  Add<br/>\na higher resist rate than enchanters and it would still be ok.  I certainly<br/>\ndon&#39;t recall anyone ever claiming it was ridiculously powerful back when it<br/>\ndid work 85% of the time.  Nobody claimed that enchanters were made obsolete<br/>\nby this.  This song used to be very useful and got me into quite a few<br/>\ngroups from level 15-18.  Since it has been broken I  have used it combat<br/>\nexactly 3 times.  I put it away in disgust all three times.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Merck [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mmerck@...\">mmerck@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 27, 2000 12:01 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Another Lullaby question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the reason lullaby will never work to the degree we all want it too<br/>\nis simple - it would devalue the enchanter class to such a huge degree there<br/>\nwould hardly be a need for them. It would be so hugely unbalancing that VI<br/>\nwill never make it work the way it seems it should.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn AoE mez that doesn&#39;t require mana, doesn&#39;t require targeting, allows you<br/>\nto melee as well and crowd control with no effort, risk or thought other<br/>\nthan hitting a single hotkey is just too powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the same reason they nerfed 54 chains.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe what people should do is offer suggestions about how to balance the<br/>\nsong in a different way other than having it not work 90% of the time. Like,<br/>\nmake it cost mana for each pulse or make it effect the bard as well as the<br/>\nmobs, or make it a single pulse song instead of a constant one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; After looking over the Lullaby data again while posting a huge<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sledgehammer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of a question hit me over the head.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why does Lullaby have a secondary resist???<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
