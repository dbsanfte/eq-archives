Maybe Tunare is just a bad server for such<br/>\n things. &lt;shrug&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on Tunare , and it is true there aren&#39;t many events on the server. But <br/>\nI do get invited into guilds all the time. Just group with someone, ask them <br/>\nhow they like their guild. Just start a casual conversation with them while <br/>\ngrouping. If you are a good bard , and they like how you do things. you&#39;ll <br/>\nget invited . Usually at the end of the night i&#39;ll get a tell from someone i <br/>\ndon&#39;t even know ( the leader of the guild ) asking me to join. Many of the <br/>\nguilds are well established so they don&#39;t actively go out and recruit , but <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t take more members. and besides every guild needs <br/>\nas many bards as they can get ) BtW feel free to  look me up on Tunare if you <br/>\never need help or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nUlaien Firesong<br/>\nLvl 40 bard of tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
