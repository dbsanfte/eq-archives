Well, you can see why I hire a newbie to guide me<br/>\naround Kele.  But there is a merch somewhere near the Preist of Dischord<br/>\nlift plats that sells these items  - they look like light stones (egg shaped<br/>\npumice) or bottles (potions.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lisa (Lilyana/Melodii)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lilyanatwin@...\">Lilyanatwin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 13, 2000 1:35 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Re: [RE: [eqbards] Need assistance please ] ]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I hope this isn&#39;t a stupid question but since I&#39;ve had no need up until<br/>\n&gt; now....where would the local magic shop be in the GF/BB area?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Melodii<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Stop by the local magic shop and buy some egg shaped pumice stones.<br/>\nSave </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
