Going by<br/>\nmemory, it seems to me that the high 20&#39;s to mid 30&#39;s, the skills raised<br/>\nquickly still.  Melee skills particularly benefit from this, as during these<br/>\nlevels, you benefit more from haste, as more of those that you group with<br/>\nhave some kind of melee haste.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I recall it was in my mid-20&#39;s, I parked in Arena for a day.  When I<br/>\ncame back, I scrolled back, and there were always at least 2 skill increase<br/>\nmessages per &quot;screen&quot;...roughly, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, I&#39;ve left myself sit for hours at a time, and I&#39;ve felt lucky to<br/>\nsee 2 skill increases for the entire time standing there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo it while you&#39;re young, because unless you spend enormous amounts of time<br/>\ndoing nothing but working on those skills, you will likely fall behind once<br/>\nyou&#39;re in the late 40&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my observations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 21, 2001 4:42 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] instrument skill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n You should try to keep all your skills maxed.
