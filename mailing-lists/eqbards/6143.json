Very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWood elven males look great I think, I realize the little wings might not be<br/>\nmacho, but it is surely better than the girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nDark elves of course has that hideous skull thing going, which although<br/>\nugly, I think looks GREAT and is very befitting of their class.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalflings and gnomes in plate end up looking like a little tin can, but<br/>\nstill neat looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nLowest ranking helm looks are humans, and wood elven girls. They both look<br/>\nlike a pencil eraser. Wood elven girls look like a trash can with Spock<br/>\nears. Just really bad. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDaleia d&#39;Allaney</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
