Have to say was one of the most boring<br/>\nnights I&#39;ve ever had in Everquest.  The Plane had been broken early Saturday<br/>\nmorning (I believe they said at 9:30 AM CDT) and I got there in anticipation<br/>\nof a respawn at approx 9:30 PM EDT.  I left at about 3:30.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe saw maybe 2-3 dozen mobs over the course of about 5.5 hours camped there<br/>\nand no Bard stuff Dropped.  I was the only Bard - so it would have been nice<br/>\nif I got a couple of Imbrued.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone know any details of Respawns?   The folks there were expecting a<br/>\nmajor spawn at between 12-14 hours - but we saw nothing of the sort.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\nJust Dinged to 48</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
