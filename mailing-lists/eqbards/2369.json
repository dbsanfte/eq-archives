From: Roop Dirump To: eqbards@onelist.com Sent: Thursday, June 24, 1999 12:55 PM Subject: [eqbards] high level bard suggestion Can t stop thinking about","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1807902965\"><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Roop Dirump <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, June 24, 1999 12:55 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [eqbards] high level bard suggestion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Can&#39;t stop thinking about weak bards at high levels, haunted with the<br/>\n  premonition of myself sitting in the entrance of some dungeon, periodically<br/>\n  calling out I need to join a group, no answer, finally logging out after a<br/>\n  long night without having done a thing.  Had an idea, though, tell me what<br/>\n  you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;ll find that at higher levels, the players DO appreciate a bard, and actively seek them out, if there&#39;s not a regular one in their cadre.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy that point, the newbie curse of the bard has worn off, there&#39;s no confusion in the upper level players mind about what a bard can do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, by default,  if you&#39;ve taken a bard to the 40&#39;s and beyond, you have &quot;proven&quot; yourself to be skilled in bardic ways and a good social animal as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention that not only do you have an active support role, you have an active combat role as well, and neither requires you to sit on your duff for 10 minutes after each fight, staring at a spell book.  And, when you&#39;re along, of course, you minimize that for others as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as boosting bardic power, it&#39;s already done.  At 45th level, (or pretty much any level after you get Hymn, for that matter) you DO see the health bar move at an appreciable rate, as well as the mana bar, when a bard is along.  A single bard in a group of 6 can flat outheal a cleric over time, doing around 1200 hp per minute per person in the party. The offensive powers of a bard are subtle, but still very potent.  DDD was added to give them a bit more rapid firepower in limited situations, for there are times when nuking is handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who thinks a high level bard is weak has a serious perception or education problem.  There&#39;s been an ongoing debate internally for months now about bards being, if anything, too powerful, and nobody internal, even the staunchest bard advocates, have ever claimed they were weak, not since phase 2 (before that point, many classes, including the bard, were in a much more unfinished state).<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think one of  the defining moments for a bard is when they find themselves no longer memorizing Bellow, even when solo.  I won&#39;t expound on that, when that time comes, you will know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo,  fear not, unless you&#39;ve done something of a personal nature to make others hesitant to group with you, you&#39;ll not lack appreciation for what you bring to the table. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
