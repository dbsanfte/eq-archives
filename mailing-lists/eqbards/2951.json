Recently I read a post online claiming that this<br/>\nsong does not last for a certain ticks like all our other buff songs do.  <br/>\n(For example, you can twist healing, jig, anthem on a good day without<br/>\nlosing any song effect)  However, that person claims that the effect of<br/>\nclarity kicks in whenever the message &quot;your mind clears&quot; is displayed and<br/>\nas soon as you stop singing the song, it no longer helps mana regen.  Can<br/>\nanyone confirm this?  I&#39;ve always twisted clarity with healing to minimize<br/>\ndowntime, but if clarity does have this rather unique property, I might<br/>\nhave to change my tactics.  I wonder why this song does not display an<br/>\nicon like all our other buff songs do.<br/>\n\tI would also love to find out whether clarity gives a<br/>\ncaster a certain amount of mana back per pulse or double his/her amount of<br/>\nmana gained while medding.  I have heard reports that multiple bards in a<br/>\nparty can all sing this song to super charge mana for casters.  Does that<br/>\none instance of one bard song per party rule not aply to this song either?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
