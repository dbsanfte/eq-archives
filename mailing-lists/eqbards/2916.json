Here is my advice to you, as you start your journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off Rivervale is a great place to base out of, Misty Thicket is a <br/>\ngreat area you can level all the up into the low teens and never leave <br/>\n(other then to train).  Since you are there do the Squad Ring quest, I&#39;m <br/>\n23rd level and the ring still comes in handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the weapon choice issue I am a fan of fast weapons, IMO the best weapons <br/>\nto get are a regular (non-rusty) dagger and a regular short sword.  Both are <br/>\nvery fast (dagger 20 delay, short sword 24), this allow you to hit alot and <br/>\nget more skill checks for weapon skill increases.  Since your server is <br/>\nstill young Fine Steel weapons are going to be scarce, but if you can get <br/>\none or two of those do so.  Most people will sell em for 2 to 4 plat for the <br/>\ndagger and short sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you are wondering &quot;How am I going to afford this?&quot; well the best way is <br/>\nto take up a trade! Tailoring is a great trade on a young server and you <br/>\nwill find plenty of wolf skins in the Rivervale area.  Other good skills for <br/>\nmoney is Brewing and Pottery. Both need seed money to get to the money <br/>\nmaking points (brewing needs about 5 plat, pottery around 20 plat).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for songs, first piece of advice BUY ALL YOUR SONGS! :)  Now that said <br/>\nyou do not have to buy them in order. Of your first 10 songs there are a few <br/>\nyou can put off buying till later: Jaxan&#39;s Jig O Vigor(3), Lyssa&#39; Locating <br/>\nLyric(4, unless in a zone where dying while lost is common),  and Elemental <br/>\nRhythms (9, unless fighting casters which is rare at this level).  Also <br/>\nbesure to train in, buy, and practice your instruments when they become <br/>\navailable, esp Percussion and String. Percussion (drums) will make Accerando <br/>\nfly and String gives a big boast to Hymn of Restoration.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong Tactics:<br/>\n1st level - Always sing Chant of Battle.<br/>\n2nd level - Experiment with Chords of Dissonance (CoD), be very careful as <br/>\nit is easy to get over your head with this song at second level.  Also <br/>\npractice &#39;twisting&#39; this song with Chant of Battle.<br/>\n3rd level - Get a little bolder with CoD, most of the critters in the newbie <br/>\narea will fall quickly to it allowing you to level fast with lots of little <br/>\nkills. Do not be afraid to die as there is no penalty (other then re-meming <br/>\nsongs).  Besure to attack the strongest opponent first.<br/>\n4th level - Continue level 3 tactics.<br/>\n5th level - Go after tougher stuff, you can even do two whites at this level <br/>\nif you have full patchwork armor (you did take up tailoring, right? &lt;grin&gt;). <br/>\nAnd if the two whites are too tough use your new song Accerando (THE best <br/>\nsong in the book) to run for the zone.<br/>\n6th level - Work Hymn of Restoration into your song twisting, it greatly <br/>\nreduces down time.<br/>\n7th level - Twist Chant of battle and your new song Jonathan&#39;s Whistling <br/>\nWarsong, you get a double str and ac boast plus attack speed boast.<br/>\n8th level - Your new song allows you to pull few mobs from a group, lull one <br/>\nor more (you have to be quick) and pull a non-lulled mob.  Great for those <br/>\ngoblin camps in Misty Thicket.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
