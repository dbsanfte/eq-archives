Annoying to<br/>\nsay the least)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there&#39;s a long standing bug/feature/whatever that IF you are<br/>\nplaying a song (heh are we ever NOT playing one?) then NONE of your icons<br/>\nwill flash.  Not sure if that&#39;s because the client can&#39;t tell which are bard<br/>\nicons and which are not if one of ours is active.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way.  If you have a song effect ACTIVE during the time that a spell<br/>\nis wearing off it&#39;s icon won&#39;t flash.  If you are not playing a song (ie:<br/>\nhave no song effects active) your icons will flash before fading.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 15, 2000 11:31 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Song Icon Bug<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t played my bard since this thread came up, but I&#39;m absolutely<br/>\n&gt; positive that both my cleric&#39;s and my shaman&#39;s icons flashed before<br/>\nfading.<br/>\n&gt; A warrior I was keeping buffs on even commented on it because when my<br/>\n&gt; shaman&#39;s icons flashed I&#39;d rebuff him then me.
