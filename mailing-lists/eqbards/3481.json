Which<br/>\nis too bad cause i woulda loved to see a dmg shield based on disease and<br/>\npoision :). But the psalm of cooling predicatbly does have a cold shield<br/>\nthat freezed amything that hits you.at lvl 40 the dmg is 6 pts too, same as<br/>\nthe psalm of warmth. Interesting thing is the shields dont seem to be<br/>\nresisted. While fighting in sol b (nafalgar or whatevers lair) i was using<br/>\nthe psalm of warmth (because i hadnt picked up cooling yet) and the kobolds<br/>\nnever resisted them. The kobolds have OUTRAGEOUS fire protection, irritates<br/>\nthe druids to the pt they cant nuke them effectively. But my fireshields<br/>\njust kept working.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
