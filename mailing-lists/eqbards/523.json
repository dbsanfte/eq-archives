When you get charmed you 90% of the<br/>\ntime go to Mel&#39;s room which has 1-2 Mino guards in there and a skel. When<br/>\nyou become uncharmed you live for about 3 seconds.  After not long he got<br/>\nhis body back and we were happy.  Later on I got charmed and killed inside<br/>\nhis room.  I would try and get close and use the corpse command but it would<br/>\nalways be too far away.  After about an hour and about 3 charms leading to<br/>\ndead bodies i tried to get someone to cast inviso on me thinking it would<br/>\nwork.  I wondered into the cave near my body and all of the sudden Mel casts<br/>\nthrough the wall and charms me again.  I was so mad I thought I would never<br/>\nget my stuff back.  I was so close to just giving up, so I said to myself<br/>\nill try 1 more time.  I walked in and made a hot key for the corpse command<br/>\nand scrolled it the whole time i was wondering around through the cave.  I<br/>\nknew where his room was and I would go slow near it.  I got 3 bodies out but<br/>\nnone of them were the ones with all my items.  I ran up really fast and kept<br/>\nscrolling it, he started to cast so i ran towards the exit.  He charmed me<br/>\nbut I was heading out the exit to the grass when it wore off and I wondered<br/>\nback In and tried again.  After about 3 of these charms not ending up in his<br/>\nroom I got my body back and I will tell you, I will never go back there<br/>\nagain.  To me its just not worth it.  I dont understand why they put a (so<br/>\ncalled 53rd lvl NPC) NPC that high in an area of 10th-12th level critters<br/>\nand that can cast through walls, attack through walls, and see someone in<br/>\ninviso.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard on Xegony<br/>\nPendar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.

Have a hot key equipped with the /corpse<br/>\n&gt; command.  Go to your corpse - then walk a bit away - click that button -<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; drag your corpse to a safe location...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde Half-Elf of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Wanting to get back in touch with old friends?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Reunite through a ONElist community. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
