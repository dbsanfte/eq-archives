The EverQuest<br/>\nservers will now be coming down on Thursday the 17th at 8am pacific. We<br/>\napologize for the late change in the<br/>\nschedule. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team <br/>\n<br/>\nUpdate Thu Feb 17 13:34:23 EST 2000<br/>\n<br/>\nThe amount of time that the servers will be down is approximately 6<br/>\nhours. That would put the time at 2 PM PST<br/>\nfor the servers to be back up. <br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPatch Update Thu Feb 17 17:45:13 EST 2000<br/>\n<br/>\nThe patch is progressing as planned, and all servers should be available<br/>\naround 3:00pm PST. <br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team <br/>\n<br/>\n(My note:  I was able to log on at 6:30 EST, thats 3:30 PST, and was<br/>\nunable to at 6:27.)<br/>\nThis last message is the kicker, and I almost fell out of my chair when<br/>\nI read it.  When looking at 3 messages stating delays, they post it as<br/>\n&quot;progressing as planned&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a few problems with this.<br/>\n1.  This the second time in 2 weeks they changed the date on a major<br/>\nscheduled downtime.  My bother scheduling downtime, if you;re not going<br/>\nto keep it?  My cleric group plays once a week (and is the main reason I<br/>\nplay EQ, I love my bard, but I think i would leave the game if I didn;t<br/>\nhave my regular cleric group).  We make sure our day does not coincide<br/>\nwith their scheduled downtime since we face such time constraints<br/>\n(normally play from 5ish to 11ish). The rest of the group was able to<br/>\nget in around 7, so our time this week was cut by 1/3, despite our best<br/>\nefforts.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Why aren&#39;t these downtimes scheduled about 3-5 horus earlier, when<br/>\nthere are many less paying customers trying to play?  I feel bad for the<br/>\npeople in Europe in Asia, but America represents the majority of their<br/>\ncustomer base.  I would even be happier if they would rotate down times<br/>\nso different people were affected each time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3.  How much time was wasted writing the True North spell.  I&#39;m sure we<br/>\ncould all name about 20 things which everyone in the game would rather<br/>\nhave seen that time spent fixing.  Has anyone thought of a use for this?<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  How do things which directly contradict the patch messages make it<br/>\npast their &quot;extensive testing?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n{rant mode off}<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
