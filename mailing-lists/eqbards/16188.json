A Necro _does_ have a very long survival rate<br/>\nin a solo situation because of their PET.  A Necro using a pet wisely can<br/>\nsurvive far longer than a solo warrior can in a 1 up fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasic Necro tactic:<br/>\nCombat mob<br/>\nMelee while casting DOT&#39;s<br/>\nBack off, let pet tank while dot&#39;s do work.  Heal up with Health drains<br/>\n(also dmg opponent)<br/>\nDrop a few nukes<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a group the Necro loses his &#39;long duration&#39; and becomes part of the<br/>\n&#39;party&#39; duration<br/>\n<br/>\nNecro&#39;s can solo incredible npc&#39;s specifically because their pets give them<br/>\na much higher &#39;survival time&#39; than any melee class enjoys.  I&#39;ve seen necros<br/>\nfight npcs far longer than my ranger or my bard can.  Because they can hurt<br/>\ntheir oponent while healing themselves and their pet.  Pluss the pet gives<br/>\nthem a &#39;pocket tank&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to dissagree but Necro&#39;s are Awesome solo and only average (actually<br/>\nslightly below average) in a group.  Necro is one of the LAST classes I<br/>\nconsider when forming a group, even with their new spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 15, 2000 2:04 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] RE: Class balance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, 15 Mar 2000, David Blank wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One thing to keep in mind is grouping vs solo.  It is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my belief that verant doesn&#39;t really care about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solo&#39;ing and they&#39;re just fine with necros being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ridiculously overpowered for solo.  In a group a necro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has some very good utility with their recent spell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; additions but prior to that their dot&#39;s caused many a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problem, dot bugs, stacking, etc.  I do think necros<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are a good but not overpowered group memeber.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not exactly what I said.  I wasn&#39;t commenting<br/>\n&gt; specifically on their solo capability.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Despite all the cries of nerf from necros, necros are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; still so overpowered compared to the other classes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that a single necro can do things that require several<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; L50s of other classes.  It hasn&#39;t been fixed yet, so<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One necro is better than a group of 2-3 L50s (maybe more,<br/>\n&gt; depending on class makeup).  You&#39;d have to be a fool not to<br/>\n&gt; want one in your group.  Yes their DoTs don&#39;t get to last<br/>\n&gt; their full duration if you kill stuff quickly, but the DoT(s)<br/>\n&gt; they do manage to put on do about as much damage as 1-3 tanks.<br/>\n&gt; Their pet does about that much too.  I could see passing up<br/>\n&gt; necros for if someone else (especially a buffer or healer)<br/>\n&gt; were available, but if there&#39;s an empty slot and a necro comes<br/>\n&gt; a-looking, they&#39;re in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you look at the formulas I whipped up for the seven-string<br/>\n&gt; lute comparison, you&#39;ll see that the two primary factors in a<br/>\n&gt; fight are damage rate, and survival time (rate of damage<br/>\n&gt; taken).  Any class who can solo well will have a very good<br/>\n&gt; ratio of these two.  When you group, you add your damage rate<br/>\n&gt; to the group&#39;s, while your survival time is usurped by those<br/>\n&gt; with the best values (tanks, pets).  Neither of these<br/>\n&gt; dramatically make the necro any weaker in groups.  Their<br/>\n&gt; primary grouped handicap is that they take a while for their<br/>\n&gt; damage rate to &quot;ramp up&quot; and the group often ends up killing<br/>\n&gt; stuff before they hit their max.  Still, it can&#39;t take *that*<br/>\n&gt; long to ramp up or else they&#39;d need to have a large survival<br/>\n&gt; time in order to solo, in which case they would be able to<br/>\n&gt; supplant the role of tank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In other words, &quot;great solo, poor grouped&quot; is a contradiction.<br/>\n&gt; The worst you can get is &quot;great solo, ok grouped.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
