You need a certain faction level to get a ring<br/>\nfrom the Sherrif. Getting one drops your faction so you can&#39;t just stand<br/>\nthere handing them out and asking the sherrif for a new one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI heard a rumor that back in Beta you had to turn the ring into the cleric<br/>\nand go back to the sherrif to ask for another ring. Thus when you turned the<br/>\nring in, your faction had to be raised enough for the sherrif to give you a<br/>\nnew one. If you were to lose the ring, sell it, or turn it in to the wrong<br/>\nperson, you had to prove your worthiness again by taking out a few more<br/>\ngoblins/orcs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow that the cleric recharges it and hands it back to you, I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat the faction adjustment would be for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Friday, June 04, 1999 11:33 AM<br/>\n8)To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n8)Subject: Re: [eqbards] Interesting Benefit of Charismatic Carralion<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)On Fri, 4 Jun 1999, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n8)&gt;<br/>\n8)&gt; so the next question would obviously be Why aren&#39;t people<br/>\n8)&gt; selling these things [squad rings]?
