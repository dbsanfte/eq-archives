Your","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1824869251\">This is my post on the EQvaults forums, thought maybe th ebard community<br/>\nwould want to see my figures.<br/>\n<br/>\nYea its not really that big of a difference.  Your shadowknight is not about<br/>\nto start leveling 40% faster. (Unless you solo all the time).  Some quick<br/>\n(and probably not all that accurate) math:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy cleric&#39;s regular group is warrior, wizard, cleric, bard.  I will list the<br/>\nindividual xp for the cleric only as they were formerly the baseline.  The<br/>\n%increase will be equal for all members though (well except that the warrior<br/>\nwill be slightly higher).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast Thrusday in Dalinars (not a zone which got an xp bump, more on that<br/>\nlater), we got 4000 xp total.  I need 1000 xp to level (warrior needs 900,<br/>\nwizard 1100, bard 1400).<br/>\n<br/>\n4000 x 1.06 (former xp bonus) = 4240 xp<br/>\nCleric gets 963 xp,<br/>\nWiz gets 1060<br/>\nWar gets 867<br/>\nBard gets 1349<br/>\n<br/>\nAll just short of our level (shucks).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis week we do the exact same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n4000 x 1.1  (new group xp) = 4400<br/>\nCleric gets 1100 xp<br/>\nWiz gets 1210<br/>\nWar gets 1100<br/>\nBard gets 1540<br/>\n<br/>\nAll but warrior get 1 lvl plus half a bub into the next (5.5 bubs).  Warrior<br/>\nis a hair over a bubble into his second level.  This is about a 14% gain in<br/>\nxp for the party.  However, since deaths are not factored in here, the %<br/>\ngain will be lower in reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk now lets take it a step further.  Say we were in Nurga which recieved a<br/>\n12% xp increase.  We can merely multipl our total by 12% to see my new xp to<br/>\nbe the following:<br/>\nCleric 1232.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is 1 level and a bit into my second bub of the next level (6.16 bubs)<br/>\nOr 127% of my original xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain death will reduce this percentage, but still it remains a nice boost.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
