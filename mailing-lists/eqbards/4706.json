Not just with new songs<br/>\neither, I&#39;m missing notes with low level songs like<br/>\nAccelerando and Hymn.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I liked about EQ combat was (other than<br/>\nweaving songs) the lack of a twitch factor.  If notes continue<br/>\nto be missed at this rate, coupled with all the resists which<br/>\nforce you to retry the song (thus inviting more missed notes),<br/>\nI may just give up.  If I wanted to play an arcade game, I<br/>\nwould&#39;ve bought a Playstation.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
