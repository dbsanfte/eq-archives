In a group of two, we were basically<br/>\nable to kill stuff non-stop (I&#39;d pull while the paladin medded<br/>\nfrom the heals he just cast), and the experience was<br/>\nphenomenal - like a bubble every couple hours.  Then another<br/>\nbig group would move in nearby, cut off our supply of stuff to<br/>\nkill, and our exp rate plummeted.  Same thing with bouncers -<br/>\npull as many as you like and the experience is pretty good (I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t try them until they were almost green).  Another group<br/>\nmoves in and the exp gain drops.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the zone is crowded, you may want to try forming a small<br/>\ngroup and finding a small nook or cranny that isn&#39;t hunted<br/>\nmuch.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
