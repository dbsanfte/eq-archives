Other areas<br/>\ndon&#39;t seem affected, we&#39;ve had a druid/enchanter charm fish in the 2nd level<br/>\nsouth room (nothing spawns there and it&#39;s a great pull spot) without<br/>\nconcern.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Christopher Sanders&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christopher.sanders@...\">christopher.sanders@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 12, 2001 10:54 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Kedge<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!

Supposedly empty and good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; xp...just sounds too perfect!  Besides, I want sharkskin drums.  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Everyone has MM drums...I wanna be different.  Until I can get Selo&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; drums,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyway...heh.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Question, though...my group will most likely depend on me to keep<br/>\n&gt; breathing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What should be the actions if I were to go LD?  Should they just camp,<br/>\nlog<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an alt, and wait until I show up?  heh...just a thought.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, a bard&#39;s song should NEVER be the primary breath source. The range is<br/>\n&gt; much too small and while it lasts longer than most songs you can twist, I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to risk it. Keep it incase someone misses a timer<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; starts to drown, you can get it going fast enough to save them since<br/>\nthere&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; little chance someone will be able to cast enduring breath on them fast<br/>\n&gt; enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stamina is a major problem in kedge since it goes down and doesn&#39;t come<br/>\nback<br/>\n&gt; up unless you get hit with Invigor so the stamina song should be cycled in<br/>\n&gt; there during a battle for a few zaps. Lancers on the top level hit very<br/>\nhard<br/>\n&gt; for their level, a decent group should be able to handle single pulls at<br/>\n&gt; 30th level. My ranger did lancers from 35-42 but I only risked them solo<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; 38th level (it&#39;s possible at 35 but I didn&#39;t want to risk it.). My necro<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t quite manage it at 30th level although a Mage can solo with their<br/>\n29th<br/>\n&gt; level earth pet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Watching the spawns move about is key, it&#39;s not rough to single pull<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n&gt; There is a high level PH on the top level, it can be a Piercer (35ish),<br/>\n&gt; Impaler (40-42), or the Fierce Impaler (42-43, drops Gloomwater or<br/>\nDarksea).<br/>\n&gt; Pulling around the high level fish isn&#39;t tough, lull shouldn&#39;t be needed<br/>\n&gt; although it might help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for the sharkskin drum ... only seen that mob once and it didn&#39;t have<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; drum. It&#39;s kind of deep, very much a 45+ area of that zone. I love kedge<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t wait till I&#39;m going into Unrest to steal people from the basement<br/>\ncamp<br/>\n&gt; to go swimming with my bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       eGroups Sponsor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
