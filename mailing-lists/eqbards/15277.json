I have a 23 bard and I was<br/>\nin Crushbone helping the low levels the other day.  I was trying to put<br/>\ncenturions and Legionaries to sleep.  I didn&#39;t have a lot of problems with<br/>\nthe cents, but the legos were near impossible for me.  I finally gave up on<br/>\nsleeping them at the zone line.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard taunt lowered? ...my ass<br/>\n-Steve<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:15 PM 2/22/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This theory came up on the concert hall board.  A bard there<br/>\n&gt;claimed to have used Lullaby with great success in Runnyeye.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyways, my new theory is that somewhere in the resist check<br/>\n&gt;when GZ should&#39;ve used the mob&#39;s level, he accidently used the<br/>\n&gt;bard&#39;s level.  So if you (the bard) are relatively low level,<br/>\n&gt;the song works reasonably well against even con mobs.  But if<br/>\n&gt;you are high level, the minimum resist rate is that of a high<br/>\n&gt;level mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It has a lot of holes, but it warrants checking out.  So if<br/>\n&gt;you are L15-25 or so, could you try logging some of your<br/>\n&gt;Lullaby episodes?  If I remember, Kitasi is about the right<br/>\n&gt;level for Runnyeye, no?  :)  You can pull out the data<br/>\n&gt;yourself, or email the logfile to me and I&#39;ll do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
