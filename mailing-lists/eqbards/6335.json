I think this is<br/>\nthe case on ALL servers.  Most times I join a group,<br/>\nfolks regard me as a third rate tank.  When I leave<br/>\nit, they KNOW what a bard can do (for some reason Im<br/>\nfinding it easy to twist 3 songs still).<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, its SOOOO frustrating when someone who<br/>\nTHINKS he knows what a bard can do starts TELLING you<br/>\nwhat to sing.  The other night, I was grouped with a<br/>\ncleric in my guild in Beholder.  He was level 18 and I<br/>\nwas hoping to grab some Minos to get him some fast exp<br/>\n(IM only level 20, but in Beholder, that means most<br/>\nGorge Minos are green and Chasm&#39;s are blue).  We met a<br/>\nDruid of level 19 there who wanted to join us, as he<br/>\nwas getting slaughtered solo.  We added him and I<br/>\ncontnued to pull.  One pull I got 3 Gorge minos<br/>\nfollowing me.  Knowing my skills, I donned my horn and<br/>\ntwisted Chords, DDD, and Largo&#39;s.  I decided that AoE<br/>\nsongs would do more to them than me with weapons.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell...the Druid starts shouting at me to get my<br/>\nweapons back on and fight (as he is standing back and<br/>\ncasting) and to turn on the Heal song.  Nobody was<br/>\nbelow 4 full bubbles of health, and the Mino&#39;s were<br/>\ndropping fast, so I ignored him till after the battle.<br/>\n When it was done, I explained why I did what I did,<br/>\nbut he didnt seem to understand.  He had the typical<br/>\n&quot;Bards should fight and sing HEAL&quot; attitude found at<br/>\naround level 20 by folks who don&#39;t know bards.  Of<br/>\ncourse, he burned ALL his mana every fight, so I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t consider him to understand HIS OWN class for<br/>\nthat matter.  After this repeated, I sent some tells<br/>\nmy cleric friend and we decided to tell the druid to<br/>\nfind another group.  I hated to send someone away, but<br/>\nI REFUSE to be told how to play my OWN class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else get this sort of thing happen to them?<br/>\n<br/>\nWindolas Stormsong (MM)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
