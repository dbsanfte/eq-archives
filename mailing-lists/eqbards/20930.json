In an effort to get changes<br/>\nimplemented as quickly as possible, they sacrifice QA testing and regression<br/>\ntesting. They then compound the problem by announcing changes before they<br/>\nactually test and make sure the changes were in fact loaded on the live<br/>\nserver. If they took an additional 30 minutes each patch day and checked to<br/>\nmake sure that the changes were indeed implemented, they would reduce<br/>\nheadache significantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, things do seem to be getting better and we can&#39;t hold<br/>\npast faults against them forever. We also have to realize that they get<br/>\nthousands of posts a day from people crying &quot;so and so is broken, FIX IT&quot;.<br/>\nFirst, I don&#39;t believe that everything is broken, it&#39;s just that many people<br/>\ndon&#39;t konw how it&#39;s supposed to be, or can&#39;t realize that it has to be a<br/>\ncertain way to prevent exploits or due to the limitations of the game<br/>\nengine. Secondly, I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t have time to fix everything, so they<br/>\nprioritize.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see them fix our songs as much as the rest of you, however given<br/>\nthat the songs in question have long since left my song line up, and I&#39;ve<br/>\nlearned to circumvent their absence, I can continue to play in the mean<br/>\ntime. It&#39;s a matter of using what we have. Since I don&#39;t expect to ever see<br/>\nthese songs fixed, I find other ways to deal with things. If they ever are<br/>\nfixed, I&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrae<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Scott Malin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Thanos0000@...\">Thanos0000@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 10, 2000 12:22 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Oh this can&#39;t be good....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, if someone wants to reply to him, just point out how many times they<br/>\n&quot;fixed&quot; the druid/ranger/ebony bladed sword root with damage spell and how<br/>\nthey swore up and down that it was fixed each time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The root does damage and breaks the root as soon as it is cast&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We fixed it&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis went on for 2-3 passes of looking at that spell.
