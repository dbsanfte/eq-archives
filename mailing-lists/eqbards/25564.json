Monsters same<br/>\nas you are indifferent, but others scowl...I didn&#39;t think to try to press<br/>\nit, and get too close...too used to avoiding scowlers, unless I know I&#39;m<br/>\nattacking...heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...there was one incident that stands out.  I was a goblin whelp in Wars<br/>\nWoods.  I watched a scaled wolf walk right by other goblins, but tear into<br/>\nme when he got close enough to aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nHardly conclusive...I don&#39;t believe it was another PC mob, since it didn&#39;t<br/>\nmake a beeline for me until it was in aggro range...in other words, it acted<br/>\nlike a mob...heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould only get the monster button on test server.  Didn&#39;t show up on any of<br/>\nthe live PVP servers...not to mention, it took 10-30 tries to get logged in<br/>\nto the login server, and on getting disconnected, would have to try to login<br/>\nall over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore to the point, what you described, Mu, is a GM event.  :)  Only a<br/>\nproblem if you get caught, since only GM&#39;s have been able to create and<br/>\ncontrol creatures that lay waste to entire zones.  Frankly, I don&#39;t see the<br/>\ndifference, since not many people will have multiple machines in the same<br/>\nroom, to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nygaardr, FC3 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nygaardr@...\">nygaardr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 08, 2001 6:32 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is an interesting thing to think about.  I have a Higher lvl enchanter<br/>\non a PvP server.  My brother logs on as a monster in and tells me (we are in<br/>\nthe same house) what zone he is in.  I find him, charm him and then buff him<br/>\nto no end.  Wait till charm wears off and watch him go rabid on unsuspecting<br/>\nnewbies. Sounds like it could be a problem to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 2:35 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the patch message itself is interesting enough (playing monsters? I <br/>\nam SO there!)  but there are also some Bard-related notes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Fixed an issue with the Bardic Epic weapon. Now if the bard has his Epic <br/>\nand an instrument that gives bonuses to songs, the best effect will take <br/>\nprecedence, rather than the Epic bonuses always being used. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat should please those who&#39;ve gotten it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso:<br/>\n&quot;Bard Piercing cap was raised to 250 at 60th level. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCool!  I&#39;ve been working with a piercing weapon as my primary for a while...<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
