I think that Warsong also doesn&#39;t stack with it.<br/>\n\tThe Rythms will help greatly if you go against spellcasters later on.<br/>\n\tLullaby probably doesn&#39;t work effectively at your skill level but it comes<br/>\nin very handy higher up. Last night in Perma I had one bar of health left<br/>\nand had 4 ice goblins (all blue) in a holding pattern while the shaman I was<br/>\nwith meditated enough mana to heal me. That took over a minute.<br/>\n\tI haven&#39;t found much use for Purifying unless you are going up against<br/>\nsnakes or spiders. Anyone know if it only jacks your resistance or can it<br/>\nremove poison and disease effects?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: Blair, Keith (Keith Blair) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Friday, July 30, 1999 7:49 AM<br/>\n8)To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n8)Subject: RE: [eqbards] Limit on song memorization<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)&gt; Now that I have Celerity and<br/>\n8)&gt; stack it with Chant of Battle<br/>\n8)&gt; I never touch Bellows.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)Just curious, does Celerity stack with Anthem de Arms?

I&#39;m<br/>\n8)looking forward to 17 for the dual weild and sneak  skills<br/>\n8)but I don&#39;t know<br/>\n8)whether to get the song since it&#39;s another in the line of<br/>\n8)Rhythms.
