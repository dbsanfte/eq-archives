(sorry if these were pointed out before)<br/>\n<br/>\n  1) When fighting ice goblin casters and the ice giant diplomat<br/>\n     I lost my mystic shielding or elemental icon immediately<br/>\n     during any spell attack.  This probably applies to all spells<br/>\n     from all NPCs, just stated what I fought for reference.<br/>\n<br/>\n     an ice goblin evoker casts a spell.<br/>\n     You feel an aura of _____ protection.<br/>\n     Your aura fades.<br/>\n     You convulse as lightning surges through your body.<br/>\n     You feel an aura of _____ protection.<br/>\n     You feel an aura of _____ protection.<br/>\n     an ice goblin evoker casts a spell.<br/>\n     Your aura fades.<br/>\n     Your skin ignites.<br/>\n<br/>\n     It&#39;s really ridiculous, any spell that hits me cancels the<br/>\n     resist shield from the song.  It&#39;s like not playing any<br/>\n     protection song at all, because everything hits for full<br/>\n     since the shield drops due to the attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n  2) Charm has lost it&#39;s mem blur component.  This was clearly <br/>\n     evident when I charmed 3 ice goblins after beating them <br/>\n     down to almost no health to let a lower level player gain<br/>\n     exp from them.  I got the kill all three times.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If someone pointed these out before, sorry to reiterate.<br/>\n <br/>\n  Also, starting fresh again after all this time made me notice<br/>\n  the stamina drain from the zone you originally start in, and<br/>\n  that safe fall is still not activated in the zone you login to.<br/>\n  I had zero stamina and took 300-400 dmg from running across<br/>\n  everfrost when I logged in.  Do they simply not realize the bugs?<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
