The answer is that its effect is twofold.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly it effects the chance at resisting the initial charm cast.<br/>\nSecondly, and more importantly, it makes it harder for the charmed NPC&#39;s<br/>\nsave to successfully roll.  This basically means it does effect duration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso charm does have a maximum duration.  The higher level charm spell you<br/>\nuse the longer the maximum duration can be.  So there is a good reason to<br/>\nuse that Allure spell even though its more mana.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nOk so now the bard related part :).  Since it has been confirmed that<br/>\ncharisma directly effects charm resist and charm duration, does this also<br/>\napply to our charm song?  I would bet the silvery 2 handed axe (21 48<br/>\nserpent sight) Im trying to sell on it ;) (1kpp in cash or items on Povar<br/>\nbtw).  I&#39;d also be willing to bet that our mesmerize songs (pixie strike<br/>\nand lullaby) have the same properties as charm... Duration and resist rate<br/>\ndirectly determined by charisma.  Im almost willing to bet that on all of<br/>\nour monster affecting songs have thier resist rate based on charisma.  The<br/>\nother thing I feel the songs are affected by is wether you are using the<br/>\nproper instrument for the song.  IE. if you are using a lute, CoD would be<br/>\nresisted less and do more damage.  Anyone want to ask GZ or do some testing?<br/>\n<br/>\nCelandro Spellsong<br/>\n34 Bard Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
