Pardon my harshness - but<br/>\nI think it&#39;s the single stupidest comment I&#39;ve ever seen on this forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nature of Internet communication is completely language based.  There<br/>\nare NO non-verbal clues.  There is no voice cues, no facial expressions, no<br/>\nhand cues.  All we have is language.  We have nothing but rhetoric.  One HAS<br/>\nnothing but language to use - and using it clearly and concisely is<br/>\nessential to getting your ideas across.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are completely guilty of what I see as the weakness of some of the<br/>\narguments here.  You&#39;ve read the first sentence of my post - objected to<br/>\nit - without ever getting to any of the points I make in the post.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I was discussing was that Jeff was making some very interesting<br/>\nand good arguments in the context of discussion - but he wasn&#39;t understood<br/>\n(by me at least) - because his use of the word &quot;overpowering&quot;.  Until we are<br/>\nall on the same page as to what he&#39;s trying to say - what&#39;s the point of<br/>\neven arguing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think he WAS arguing that bards are &quot;Overpowered&quot; in the sense of<br/>\nwhat SLYDE thinks the word &quot;Overpowered&quot; means.  I am very eager to see what<br/>\nWHEE really does believe...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Wasserman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 28, 2001 10:50 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Whats the arguement?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m have to argue semantics here.&quot;<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to have to stop reading here.
