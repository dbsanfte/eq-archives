After selling my BP I went to the chap<br/>\nselling the helm, and opened the trade window, I had a shock when he put a<br/>\ncrafted helm in the window (aaarrgghh). Shit no BP now, got lots of pp but<br/>\nno one will sell Charred BP for that amount. and I didn&#39;t have enough to<br/>\nbuy the Steel BP back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen all of a sudden I noticed the Lambent BP for sale, I asked how much<br/>\nand she said 1500pp. So I offered 1000, she said 1400, I said 1200, she<br/>\nsaid 1300 I said 1250pp so we met halfway. In order to buy this though I<br/>\nhad to sell my Steel Greaves and Boots. But I raised enough cash and had to<br/>\ngo around in Leather leggings and sandals, until I found someone selling<br/>\nbronze.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the only item I am gonna get myself, I have now managed to get the<br/>\nVambraces and Gauntlets myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nGot the Runes from Choon and Froon the other day, and the Fiery Vambraces,<br/>\nI now need Firewalker boots (which are very rare, spent 5 hours saturday in<br/>\nexcellent group and we held the whole area around the king room, but no<br/>\nboots)  8(<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to lower Guk aswell (first time ever been there, scary stuff). I<br/>\nzoned in and immediately joined a group who helped me get Shin Greaves ad<br/>\nGauntlets.<br/>\nLater that day I went to Mistmoore (for Silk gloves), did not get any<br/>\nbut.........<br/>\n<br/>\non sunday morning I walked into the mm prison, opened the doors and looted<br/>\na will sappers corpse, and there was 1 rather nice pair of Black Silk<br/>\nGloves just for me.   8)<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent sunday night in Perma in the King room, killed 5-6 Elite Guards and<br/>\nno Icy greaves so I&#39;m a little bit pissed off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I have got, Vambraces, Gloves and BP and am at the moment trying my<br/>\nhardest to get the missing parts for my greaves and Boots.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, looking rather snazzy in his new Lambent Armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt; on<br/>\n14/11/99 18:02:23<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\ncc:    (bcc: John Senior/M&G)<br/>\nSubject:  RE: [eqbards]  Lambent<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ndon&#39;t worry Martyn, that is one of the most outrageously prices asked i<br/>\nhave<br/>\nseen.
