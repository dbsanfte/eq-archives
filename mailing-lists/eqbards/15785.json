You betcha.).  He asked me what weapons I was<br/>\nusing (Thulian Blade and Obs shard), then told me to invis and come on down<br/>\nto the area where the Captain used to spawn.  I had forgotten all about the<br/>\nblade and it&#39;s nifty properties.  He invited me to group, pulled the gnollie<br/>\nin question, layed the almighty smacketh-down (he was a maxxed druid)  on<br/>\nit, then told me to loot.  After I looted the Kisch, he and his dwarf both<br/>\nbuffed the bejeezus outta me, then logged.

Now I&#39;m happily wield the Yk in the<br/>\n&gt;primary and the Kisch in the offhand.  Big difference from my old claws and<br/>\n&gt;silvery war axe.  Think the Yk camp is bad?  The Tesch Val Dval&#39;Nmak that<br/>\n&gt;drops the Kisch is a 2 hour spawn and his rare is the sword and he really<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t have a common although he occasionally drops a crummy gold ring.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been killing him twice to three times a night for almost 2 weeks.
