About the only things that resisted it were red cons that were upper 30&#39;s-ish to maybe 40.

Make sure you put at least one point into your brass skill when<br/>\n&gt;you train (i put a all I could as soon as I could) because it does take a<br/>\n&gt;bit to fire up this song when you first start using it. I did ask a high<br/>\n&gt;level bard what the best thing to do to max the song out was and he said go<br/>\n&gt;to freeport newbie area... it did help, then I used it in EC in the easier<br/>\n&gt;area and that helped, finally I got too impatient, so I just started using<br/>\n&gt;it along with the other two (CoD and Hymn) and in 5 days it went from 30 or<br/>\n&gt;40something to it being in the 70s now - can&#39;t wait until it catches the<br/>\n&gt;rest of my instruments! One of the things I have found was that I&#39;ve started<br/>\n&gt;using more than just the basic hotkey setups too - I have one for melee with<br/>\n&gt;the inventory and melee slots - and one for songs (those two I use together<br/>\n&gt;when grouping where I don&#39;t want to pull lots of things with the DDD/CoD<br/>\n&gt;songs)- but I also have one that has DDD/CoD/Hymn AND a melee slot with two<br/>\n&gt;inventory slots - where I switch the horn with the lute and have the drum<br/>\n&gt;handy in case I need to run....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Brangwen Incantare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
