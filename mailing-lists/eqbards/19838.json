IIRC, someone posted a while back that every bard<br/>\nsong that affects a mob checks against the mob&#39;s magic resist rate.  But to<br/>\nme it would seem to make more sense that these two songs are exceptions and<br/>\nuse the mob&#39;s fire/cold resist rate.  Can somebody confirm what the correct<br/>\nanswer is?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I recently made 38th so started using CoF for the first time.  What is<br/>\nup with the text message you get when this song sticks?  It reads &quot;(mob)<br/>\nbegins to chant&quot;.  You would think it would say something like &quot;a mob is<br/>\ncovered with flickering flames&quot; or something to that effect.  I did a double<br/>\ntake when I saw that message for the first time.  During the fight, someone<br/>\nin the group asked the question &quot;Anyone know why the mob started to chant, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t think this mob could cast spells.&quot;  After the fight I told them it<br/>\nwas the text message indicating my CoF was working.  Like myself, no one in<br/>\nthe group had ever seen that particular text message before.  This<br/>\nimmediately sent up a red flag to me that this group (a pickup one) hadn&#39;t<br/>\ngrouped with many 38+ bards before so I then had to give then my standard<br/>\nquickie lesson on how to group with a bard.  Hadn&#39;t had to do that in a long<br/>\ntime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
