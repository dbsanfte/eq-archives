I created my bard as pretty much<br/>\n&gt; a rogueish lad.  I tend to be drunk a LOT (yes, much<br/>\n&gt; to the dismay of my friends, even in battle) and tease<br/>\n&gt; EVERYBODY (my clan is SOOO sick of Limericks).  In<br/>\n&gt; keeping with this, I have stuck to peircing weapons<br/>\n&gt; since level 2 (where I found a nifty rusty spear).  I<br/>\n&gt; am fairly well armed now, with a Dragoon Dirk and a<br/>\n&gt; Combine Rapier (what I wouldn&#39;t give for an Ashenwood<br/>\n&gt; Spear) and so far I LOVE my choice of weapons (Since I<br/>\n&gt; NEVER seem to get into a group with more than one<br/>\n&gt; tank...and usually that is me..I have fit into the<br/>\n&gt; role of battle bard more than I&#39;d care to think<br/>\n&gt; about).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My big question.  Am I making a mistake that will bite<br/>\n&gt; me at later levels? (Shada....help me out here)  Every<br/>\n&gt; weapon I&#39;ve heard about that is decent damage for<br/>\n&gt; bards at high levels is 1H Slash.  Did I, for<br/>\n&gt; roleplaying purposes, limit my usefulness at later<br/>\n&gt; levels?  I really like the bard I created, as he is<br/>\n&gt; SOOO different from the Cleric I had, and Im managing<br/>\n&gt; to turn my guild into a bunch of drunks with me..hehe,<br/>\n&gt; but I don&#39;t want to find out at level 3x that I should<br/>\n&gt; have chosen to raise my 1h slash, as to do any decent<br/>\n&gt; damage and be worth my wieght, I need to wield a<br/>\n&gt; 1hSlash weapon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Work with me here folks, Im at work and sober (in game<br/>\n&gt; and IRL)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Windolas Stormsong (Still at 20th Song, MM)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Celebrate the NEW ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; Enter to win a trip to Hawaii!
