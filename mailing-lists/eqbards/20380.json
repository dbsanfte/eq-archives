NewbieBard is now level 11 and, having all songs<br/>\nbelow 20 in the bank (though I will have to back for training brass and dual<br/>\nwield) I have landed in Kunark. After binding at the bank (no point in<br/>\nbinding at the bridge, I will always need a drum for the return trip) I<br/>\nheaded off to Kurn&#39;s Tower in the Field of Bone. What a perfect place for<br/>\nbeing a bard of 11 songs. The downside is you will not be able to hang on to<br/>\nyour silver or copper, the upside of that is you can offer it to any<br/>\ngroupmates in trade for bone chips, which you can sell later and more than<br/>\nmake up for your lost coin. Here was my pitch when I entered the tower:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Bard 11 looking for a group that will make sure I stay alive. If you think<br/>\nyou hit a lot now, wait till you are hasted. A warning for those with<br/>\nallergies, I am a mammal, but I have had my shots.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first part is important, the run from FV is fun if it is very<br/>\ninfrequent, the second part is offer of something that you mostly can&#39;t get<br/>\nin Field of bone/Kurn&#39;s tower, so I should be in pretty good demand. The<br/>\nlast part is to let them know that I am not a D3Wd. It got me a group<br/>\nimmediately, and I expect getting groups won&#39;t be a problem (if so I can<br/>\nalways hunt solo inside or at the bottom of the ramp).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate selling your abilities without being too heavy handed  (I really<br/>\nfind calls of &quot;Bard looking for group I HAVE MANASONG&quot; to be just a bit<br/>\ntatty) often gets pretty good results. Knowing what you can provide and<br/>\nwhere the best place is to offer it is half the battle, the other half is<br/>\ncommunicating your message, if you get it right, you will rarely have<br/>\ntrouble finding groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nNewbie Bard formerly known as Tszaaz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
