Is twisting a<br/>\n&gt; requirement, can you possible get to 50th level without twisting.  A) I<br/>\n&gt; think twisting might be a slight exploit (Not that I get mad if anyone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>else<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; does it), B) the messages that bards spam in the chat window gets so<br/>\n&gt; annoying, and hard to read, I miss a lot of important messages from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>friends<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and party members.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t need to ask a level 50...<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you get to level 50 without twisting? You can get there without playing<br/>\nany songs. But parties are going to question what good you are. Why does any<br/>\nhunting party need a bard? Really... they don&#39;t. So you need to really<br/>\nimpress people ya don&#39;t know. God I had to get a full suit of bronze so I<br/>\ncould get into parties at level 20 because of all the damn twinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd twisting is not an exploit, but rather a &quot;feature&quot; of our class. We are<br/>\nbalanced with twisting in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill one song be good enough? Sure, and your party will boot you out when<br/>\nthe first tank comes along because you are doing 20 points of damage a<br/>\nround, constantly frenzying the mobs, and don&#39;t add anything to the party as<br/>\na whole.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
