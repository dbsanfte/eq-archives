There is one trick, if one of your weapons can be equipped in the ranged weapon slot (dragoon dirks, mino axes maybe others, I don t know precisely which)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1120891028\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;From: Jesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When playing my new bard, I took a common suggestion I heard of making<br/>\n&gt;hotkeys for the two melee slots and several (four) invetory slots. I have<br/>\n&gt;bags/boxes in my other four slots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This makes it very easy to switch instruments/weapons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was wondering, is there any trick to keeping those inventory slots open<br/>\n&gt;(i.e. free of random loot) without manually having to put every item into<br/>\n&gt;a bag? I bought a mandolin and horn to fill 2 more slots, but there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;still 1 empty slot (which needs to stay empty, so when I swap out 1<br/>\n&gt;instrument, there&#39;s room for a shield + weapon). Anytime I look anything<br/>\n&gt;it gets automatically dropped into that slot, which is very annoying when<br/>\n&gt;trying to switch weapons later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hopefully there&#39;s some good tips out there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks, =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is one trick, if one of your weapons can be equipped in the <br/>\nranged weapon slot (dragoon dirks, mino axes maybe others, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know precisely which) replace one of the general slots with<br/>\nthe ranged weapon slot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow you have<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral  Ranged<br/>\nMelee 1  Melee 2<br/>\nGeneral  General<br/>\n<br/>\nif the three generals have instruments in them, <br/>\nGrab Main weapon, drop in ranged (or swap<br/>\nwith instrument) swap with second weapon <br/>\n(or pick up instrument and swap) drop back in<br/>\nempty general spot or ranged slot <br/>\n<br/>\nSince the 3 general slots are always full, and<br/>\nnothing auto drops to the ranged, you always<br/>\nhave it free.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust be sure to not have a ranged attack key<br/>\nwhere you might hit it by mistake :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
