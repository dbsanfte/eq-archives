Any class that can &#39;get the attention&#39; of another<br/>\nmob will find rogues quite valuable.  Bards used to be the absolute best at<br/>\nthis and I remember once grouping with a rogue when I was around 15th lvl.<br/>\nHe&#39;d backstab it and it would turn to face him, my song would pulse it would<br/>\nface me, he&#39;d backstab it, etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think rogues got the shaft in a way because Verant couldn&#39;t figure out how<br/>\nto make traps work.  They seem to have only poorly implemented locks as<br/>\nwell.  Other than that rogues seem to be pretty good fighters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Webber, Jessica [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 13, 2000 10:39 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Rogues and bards (was Why didn&#39;t I log out<br/>\nsooner?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading posts about what an awesome combonation it is pairing a<br/>\nbard and a rogue (written by both bards and rogues)  I haven&#39;t heard so much<br/>\nfrom other classes about great success they have with rogues.

With<br/>\n&gt; just me and a rogue we can chain/fear or instill <br/>\n&gt; doubt/backstab mobs left<br/>\n&gt; and right.  Most recent example was in the Overthere zone.  <br/>\n&gt; There was a<br/>\n&gt; party of four pulling to the FM zone.  I was already grouped <br/>\n&gt; with a rogue<br/>\n&gt; and we asked to join the party.  They were willing to add me <br/>\n&gt; but not the<br/>\n&gt; rogue.  I told them either both of us or none of us.  They <br/>\n&gt; decided against<br/>\n&gt; adding us both.  We showed them up by using <br/>\n&gt; chains/fear/backstab right there<br/>\n&gt; next to them.  We pulled and killed just as many mobs as they <br/>\n&gt; did.  Since we<br/>\n&gt; had little downtime, theres a good chance we killed more mobs <br/>\n&gt; than they did.<br/>\n&gt; And since there was just two of us, I think its safe to say <br/>\n&gt; we ended up<br/>\n&gt; getting more EXP than they did.  Anytime a group I&#39;m in <br/>\n&gt; refuses to add a<br/>\n&gt; rogue, I&#39;ll drop from the group and join him myself.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jamie Bedford [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbedford@...\">bbedford@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 12, 2000 3:00 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Why didn&#39;t I log out sooner?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Would you really rather have not had an entire evening of <br/>\n&gt; awesome grouping<br/>\n&gt; so that you wouldn&#39;t lose a little experience?

If I could stay level 48 for the rest of my EQ <br/>\n&gt; carreer, but have a<br/>\n&gt; lot of fun and always be grouped in the process, I would give <br/>\n&gt; up exp in a<br/>\n&gt; heartbeat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Shop online together.
