If<br/>\nyou start/stop Hymn in this manner, all that happens is that<br/>\nyour hp display refresh starts to look funny.  It will go up<br/>\nas if the trick is working, then go back down to the X hp/6<br/>\nsec you&#39;d expect if you just left the song running.  The net<br/>\neffect is that you still heal at the X hp/6 sec rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne person speculated that Hymn actually increases your hp<br/>\nregeneration rate, instead of restores hp every time it<br/>\npulses, and the pulse effect is just due to the client being<br/>\nrefreshed once every 6 seconds.  I don&#39;t think this is exactly<br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on because even if I start/stop Hymn, it still<br/>\nends up healing in increments of X hp/6 sec.  e.g. if Hymn<br/>\nnormally heals 11 pts/pulse, I&#39;ve never had Hymn end and I&#39;ve<br/>\nhealed anything other than multiples of 11 points even if by<br/>\nstart/stopping it I&#39;ve made it last a half-pulse longer than<br/>\nnormal.  Anyway, you can&#39;t exceed the X hp/6 sec rule with<br/>\nHymn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was some other discussion about getting Hymn to stack<br/>\nwith another bard whose Hymn healed a different amount.  I<br/>\nstill haven&#39;t heard if anyone has tested any of the theories<br/>\nwe came up with about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
