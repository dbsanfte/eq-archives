I started on Xegony the week the game went<br/>\n&gt;public - and I never begged and don&#39;t recall people begging.  I find it<br/>\n&gt;quite common.  People begging for cash particularly bug me.  On the other<br/>\n&gt;hand - I had a level 6 bard (I&#39;m 19) ask me very nicely I had any armor I<br/>\n&gt;could spare.  I did in fact have some stuff in the bank that I was too lazy<br/>\n&gt;to try to sell - so I figured, what the hey - I&#39;ll help this guy out...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Slyde of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;&lt;Army of Virtue&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Last night in Everfrost, I was fighting my (then level 4, now 5 shaman) deep<br/>\nin the pass that spawns polar bear cubs, gobby whelps and gnoll pups.<br/>\nFighting beside me was Sunbear, a warrior (level 3, I think).  Because of<br/>\nthe<br/>\nconstant stream of creatures, we were slowly getting beaten down, and<br/>\nhad no time to loot, bodies were strewn everywhere.  In the final fight,<br/>\nhe was down to 1/4 health, there were 3 bears on him, and I went oom<br/>\ntrying to save him.  He died, and I RAN like a little girl for the guards.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got back, I picked up the pelts from the bears (practicing tailoring)<br/>\nthen he got back shortly after.  I felt bad doing the looting (I didn&#39;t<br/>\nthink<br/>\nhe&#39;d make it back before they became free for anyone to loot) so I gave<br/>\nhim the patchwork tunic I&#39;d just made.  I think that&#39;s about as close to<br/>\ntwinking as I&#39;ve come.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
