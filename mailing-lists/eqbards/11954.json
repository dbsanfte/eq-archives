All it&#39;s done is made him<br/>\n&gt; more difficult to kill.  Well, there are lots of ways to make<br/>\n&gt; mobs more difficult to kill without resorting to random<br/>\n&gt; insta-death.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You folks are trying to justify the DT saying that he&#39;s a god<br/>\n&gt; and should have it.  That&#39;s fine and good, but if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; use it like a being of super-intelligence, then I don&#39;t see it<br/>\n&gt; being much different than death by router crash - i.e. it gets<br/>\n&gt; applied more or less randomly and without reason.  You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; justify either being necessary for the game IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know why you picked my message to tack this replay onto, I&#39;m<br/>\nagreeing with you.
