There is a group here who believe it is the enormous number of<br/>\n&gt; items<br/>\n&gt; ever growing in the character databases that Verant is concerned about.<br/>\n&gt; By<br/>\n&gt; making them No Drop they were trying to keep the number of in game objects<br/>\n&gt; down.  An interesting speculation and a reason why it took so long to get<br/>\n&gt; the bank set up to accept No Drop items perhaps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tThe problem with that theory is that there&#39;s only such much any one<br/>\nperson can keep.  8 characters x 8 bank slots x 10 backpack slots = 6400<br/>\nitems, plus the items on the 8 characters, per account, per shard.  Of<br/>\ncourse this is exluding stackable items, but light-stones aren&#39;t stackable.<br/>\nStackable items can only increase this by 20 fold, assuming that everything<br/>\nyou owned was stackable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBien<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
