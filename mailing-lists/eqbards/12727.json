As it took him nearly 2 <br/>\nmonths to reply to this.  I sent him the  first draft of these questions <br/>\nback in mid november.  The anfter posting it on the Sony EQ board it had to <br/>\nbe bump nearly 300 times before abashi even acknowledged it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] GZ answers<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 6 Jan 2000 15:45:47 -1000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rokenn,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Since you were able to get a response from Abashi and GZ, you might want to<br/>\n&gt;send them a reminder for when they fix the percussion aspect of Furfil&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;Curtailing Chant.  Lets assume after they code the fix equipping a drum <br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt;now increase the damage of the DOT and the amount of magic resistance the<br/>\n&gt;mobs loses.  I think we should remind them to remember the MM battle drum<br/>\n&gt;when they code the fix.  Singing Furfil&#39;s with the MM battle drum equipped<br/>\n&gt;should increase the DOT and magic resistance amount 20% (I think thats what<br/>\n&gt;everyone says it increases resist songs by) more than with a normal drum<br/>\n&gt;equipped.  Based on their track record, if we don&#39;t remind them they will<br/>\n&gt;probably forget about including the MM battle drum as part of the patch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant and the other Chant songs, The percussion<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aspect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of these songs is broken. Using a drum produces no additional effect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(damage or resistance debuff).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ***GZ SAYS***<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmm - don&#39;t use that one much. I&#39;ll check. If so, we&#39;ll get it fixed <br/>\n&gt;right<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; **************<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
