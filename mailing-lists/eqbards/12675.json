I can see in the near future where guilds will have to<br/>\nstart using a waiting list, schedule, etc that every guild must abide by.<br/>\nFull time GM required to make sure everyone plays by the rules (don&#39;t<br/>\nlaugh:-)  Maybe a modified version of the /yield rule for guilds??<br/>\n<br/>\nShort term solution?:  To promote a &quot;community&quot; atmosphere, why don&#39;t the<br/>\nhigh level guilds try cooperating with other guilds on a trial basis.<br/>\nPerhaps agree to limit each guild to having one full group participate.<br/>\nHave four guilds participate and you get the magic number of 24 people<br/>\nfighting the dragon that everyone seems to think is the best number to<br/>\nhandle lag. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Wonder how many of the players who act the way mentioned below, no<br/>\nmatter what guild they are in, fall into the stereotype category of<br/>\n&quot;powergamer&quot;?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; \tTo many, such practices seem &quot;elitist&quot;.  I can definitely<br/>\n&gt; understand why someone would think that, some of my guildmates do act with<br/>\n&gt; that kind of attitude.  But there IS a logical reason for not inviting<br/>\n&gt; outside people, in addition to the fact that inter-guild co-ordination is<br/>\n&gt; alot of work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
