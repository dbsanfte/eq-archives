I<br/>\n&gt; figured it was another player until he tagged with a damage over<br/>\n&gt; time(DOT). I made it to the zone before he could catch me and zoned out<br/>\n&gt; and theDOT still took me down 3 and 1/2 bubbles of health (I had 571<br/>\n&gt; hit points at level 19).&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Create a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n&gt; ...and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
