They spawn fast enough to support two<br/>\ngroups and drop bronze weapons.  (And they aggro bards<br/>\nmore than the crushbone orcs ever did)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile you&#39;re there, see the armoror on the thrid floor<br/>\nof the Freeport militia bldg and do the Reserve<br/>\nMilitia Tunic quest.  They are only AC 9 but +3 dex<br/>\nand look very cool.  Like blood red chain.  I had a DE<br/>\nSK offer me 50 plat for mine the other night in<br/>\nLavastorm.  Too bad it&#39;s no drop;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile you&#39;re in the commons, watch out for people<br/>\nasking for help in body recovery -- most of them want<br/>\nyou to go to Kithicor forest...and it seems like most<br/>\nof them want to go just before nightfall.  If that&#39;s<br/>\nthe case, make them wait for morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>\nBard of the 16th Song<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Jennifer McComb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mccomb@...\">mccomb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Over the last few weeks, Adagia&#39;s goal was to<br/>\n&gt; acquire a Dragoon Dirk<br/>\n&gt; and to reach level 12 so she could finally sing<br/>\n&gt; Brusco&#39;s Boastful<br/>\n&gt; Bellow.  Last weekend her call to purchase a Dirk in<br/>\n&gt; Crushbone was<br/>\n&gt; finally answered, and last night she earned the<br/>\n&gt; right to scribe the<br/>\n&gt; 12th song.  She&#39;s currently calling E. Freeport<br/>\n&gt; home, and she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; finding the adventures there entertaining, but she<br/>\n&gt; has suddenly found<br/>\n&gt; herself without any burning immediate goals.  What<br/>\n&gt; excitement waits<br/>\n&gt; for a Bard of 12 songs? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Adagia,<br/>\n&gt; Bard of 12 songs,<br/>\n&gt; Luclin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
