And he couldn&#39;t keep up in damage with me?  It<br/>\nwas all too crazy to follow but I suspect he yelled for help, then ducked<br/>\nand hid while others croaked and tried to jump in once there were only a few<br/>\npeople left and Dvinn was badly hurt.  Since I was bellowing Dvinn didn&#39;t<br/>\nget around to me until there were just the two of us and I outlasted him by<br/>\na bubble. Hah, my four bubbles evaporated ridding him of his last half a<br/>\nbubble.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, what are these things selling for?  I may keep it as a memento but I<br/>\nreally hate the way a dagger looks in your hands, a spear or scimitar is so<br/>\nmuch more intimidating.
