Can do the lord room,<br/>\nI know since i&#39;ve done it.<br/>\nAnd if you add another 50 necro,enchanter,wizard,magician<br/>\nit gets very simple.<br/>\nThere are many diffrent tactics on how to do the room.<br/>\nI havnt tried the tactic for doing the room solo but i guess<br/>\nby using charm, fd, then charm another when first one is dead.<br/>\nthen when last one is left, root him, get pet and let pet,bond of death,lich,new pet<br/>\ndo the work.<br/>\nBut sounds risky to me, so i rather ask a enchanter friend to help me<br/>\nout :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n/Wintir 14 bard<br/>\n/Thoul 50 necro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJasonF wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hear this a lot.  &quot;Man, did you see that 49/50 Necro soloing the Lord<br/>\n&gt; room?&quot;  I&#39;ve never seen it done, and no one that I know personally on Fennin<br/>\n&gt; Ro has seen it done.  I always hear words to the effect of &quot;it just takes a<br/>\n&gt; bit of strategy&quot;, but no one has every had any comment on what that strategy<br/>\n&gt; might be.  The Ghoul Lord room, if broken and the three spawns staggered<br/>\n&gt; perfectly could not be held for any length of time by only one or two<br/>\n&gt; individuals in my opinion.  The Boks and Guks that spawn there probably have<br/>\n&gt; around 15,000 hit points and do serious melee damage.  I&#39;ve been in high<br/>\n&gt; 40s/50s groups that have spent three or four minutes killing a single frog.<br/>\n&gt; If you get a Guk Wizard spawning as the Lord placeholder you&#39;re in serious<br/>\n&gt; trouble with only two folks and a pet.  When the Lord spawns he has even<br/>\n&gt; MORE hitpoints and he&#39;s gonna Harm Touch one of ya (and hopefully) be<br/>\n&gt; procing Ykesha on you.  If you know how one guy can stand up to that I sure<br/>\n&gt; would like to hear it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now granted, I have been in groups with a 50 necro where the pet solod Lava<br/>\n&gt; Duct Crawlers in Sol B and the pet had more than half health at the end of<br/>\n&gt; the fight.  Not only that, the necro (Cinder) said &quot;Sigh - you shoulda seen<br/>\n&gt; my pet *before* they nerfed Necros.&quot;  Well damn.  A single LDC can make a<br/>\n&gt; full group in their lower 40s run for the zone with a couple of deaths but<br/>\n&gt; one Necro pet (blue to me) can solo one?  And Necros complain?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Crier<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Dark&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Heh the lord room is so easy. It&#39;s not as hard as people can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think and I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seen it held with a couple diffrent combos of two people casters<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and usually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one is with pet though. However even after the patch the room is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quite easy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to crack with 1 necro and 1 person of any other class. It just takes a bit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of strategy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;   You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
