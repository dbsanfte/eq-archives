Just","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-451561743\">Armor should not be a problem.  Never ever buy weapons or armor from stores!<br/>\nAlways buy from other players, because you&#39;ll -usually- get a better deal.<br/>\nJust type /auction Looking for patchwork armor in (large/small/medium)!<br/>\nFor 1 pp you should be able to pick up a -full- set of patchwork armor, I<br/>\nhave heard tailors making just such a package deal, and it&#39;s nearly as good<br/>\nas leather.  Later, you should set your eyes on player-made banded armor,<br/>\nbetter than that store ringmail, and far far cheaper.  More and more smiths<br/>\nare competing now, and I was pleasantly surprised when a group of smiths<br/>\nwere making banded armor for COST (supplies) in greater faydark!  A fletcher<br/>\njoined in and started doing the same thing!  Then there were free binds!<br/>\nHallelulia, the power gamers aren&#39;t just high level now!!!  I have seen<br/>\nbanded tunics and pants for as high as 30 pp each, bought mine for 15 pp<br/>\neach from a fellow with &quot;guaranteed&quot; lowest prices.  When shopping, head to<br/>\nthe zone where a /who gives a large number.  Shop around, when in doubt<br/>\nabout a price someone offers you, ask someone else if it&#39;s fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven with magic items, buying from players your best bet.  I can sell a<br/>\nCuthroat Dervish Ring to my guild for 3gp, and then the guild will turn<br/>\naround and sell it for 4pp!  Players will sell you their Dervish Rings for<br/>\nless than 1pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo avoid the easy temptation of dealing with an NPC whenever you can.<br/>\nUnload the junk on em is all, and buy your water if you can&#39;t scavenge it<br/>\nyourself.  Only wish we could milk our own cows.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.
