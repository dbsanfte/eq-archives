In order for us to acquire other more important traits<br/>\n  in early beta, bards gave up two handed slashing.  All the bards<br/>\n  made a big stink about it too.  Personally, I&#39;d rather wear plate<br/>\n  and dual wield.  Just as the instrument pieces are still left over<br/>\n  from an attempt to get bards to fuse their own instruments, so is<br/>\n  the Two-Handed Slashing box at training in the Guild.  It&#39;s merely<br/>\n  an icon of the past, so to speak.  You cannot train or raise skill<br/>\n  in it.  We are forever stuck at ground zero.<br/>\n<br/>\n  (I would use the axe for looks tho, 2hs is kinda freaky on a bard)<br/>\n  <br/>\n  You would definitely stand out of the BRD crowd.  As for melee<br/>\n  effectiveness, we dont have double attack (nor need it) so you<br/>\n  would feel the strain of a 44 delay weapon at the lowest skill<br/>\n  possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic Distortion, 46th (goodbye hell levels) unchained melody.<br/>\n  League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n  &lt;Lords of Aesir&gt; Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
