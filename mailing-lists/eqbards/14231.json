However it is possible that they did not change the song.  The problem is they probably DID alter the resist code which the song rolls against. Remember we don&#39;t count in the grand Verant plan.\r<br/>\nWhat they DO lie about and I really think we need to do something about this, is that they have anyone actually play testing bards.  One of the most important things I think we need to do is demand a bard advocate to replace GZ.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI think the whole Archmage Answers Fiasco proves beyond doubt having the mage decide what our powers and songs should be doesn&#39;t work.  We need to appeal to Brad and Abashi, and the heads of Verant for a TRUE person with a vision for a bard.. and to stop being an after thought\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 3 Feb 2000 11:14:51 -0500 (EST) <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> wrote:\r<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;   I was roaming around the net and I found these old pictures Sylly\r<br/>\n&gt;   took.

That&#39;s right, completely still.  Hardly\r<br/>\n&gt;   anything attacked me, they stayed asleep until I stopped playing.\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;   This is how it used to be.  Verant (and GZ) blatantly lied that\r<br/>\n&gt;   they haven&#39;t adjusted this song since release.
