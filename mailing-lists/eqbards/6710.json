There is some concern<br/>\n&gt; floating about that a minimum skill of 100 in forage is required to get<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; new unique items people are finding in the different zones.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a bit of good news, I foraged an &quot;ash root&quot; last night (I think it<br/>\n&gt; was in Kithcor) and later foraged a normal &quot;root&quot; in HighKeep.  They were<br/>\n&gt; definitely separate items and did not stack with one another (much like<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; old berries and fruit that have been around and have the same graphic).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any other bards on this list found any of the unique new forage items yet<br/>\n&gt; too?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW - my forage is maxed at the cap, 40.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Faras<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   New!!
