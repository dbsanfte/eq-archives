As was mentioned yesterday, any mob with SOW <br/>\non it can no longer be chained and will tear off to find help. This nearly <br/>\nkilled me last night in Solusek&#39;s Eye. I was healing at the clockworks <br/>\nwaiting for my partner when a young goblin strolled through for some reason <br/>\nand attacked.<br/>\n<br/>\nChains is NOT being resisted but is not giving any success or failure <br/>\nmessages at all when used on certain creatures. After I put the beatdown on <br/>\nthe young&#39;n he ran off to find help-- way to fast for me to catch him <br/>\nwithout Selo&#39;s. He brought back a flame gobbo and two cinders. Chain worked <br/>\njust fine on the flame but still would not give any messages when used on <br/>\nthe young one (who had been SOW&#39;ed by one of the gobbo shamans on his <br/>\npath).<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily my partner got back at that time and evacuated us out, I was about <br/>\nto fear and run for my life when he came in and started casting. This new <br/>\n&quot;bug&quot; or feature will get you killed if you are expecting Chains to hold <br/>\nthe mob in front of you. I&#39;ve done a bug report as should everyone else who <br/>\nnotices this effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nBertran Headbasher<br/>\nBard of 32 songs, Bertoxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
