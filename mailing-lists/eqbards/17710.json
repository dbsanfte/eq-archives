We are having an event on <br/>\n&gt; my server,<br/>\n&gt; Karana, on Saturday. We are having a chessmatch at the <br/>\n&gt; chessboard with duels.<br/>\n&gt; Different level players have been chosen for the role&#39;s of <br/>\n&gt; King, Queen,<br/>\n&gt; Bishop, Rooks and Pawns. I volunteered to be there because my <br/>\n&gt; guild has a<br/>\n&gt; major role in the event. I am a Level 11 bard. I figured I <br/>\n&gt; would be asked to<br/>\n&gt; assist in the organization of the event. However, I have been <br/>\n&gt; chosen as a<br/>\n&gt; PAWN! Could anyone advise me on the best strategy to employ <br/>\n&gt; to possibly come<br/>\n&gt; out of this alive? I know I am probably being vague as to <br/>\n&gt; some of the rules of<br/>\n&gt; the game but that is because they are still being determined. <br/>\n&gt; I do know that<br/>\n&gt; charming will not be allowed. Only self-buffs will be <br/>\n&gt; allowed. DOT&#39;s are<br/>\n&gt; allowed. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am still in the process of figuring out how to be the best <br/>\n&gt; bard that I can<br/>\n&gt; be and I have a lot to learn. So I look to each of <br/>\n&gt; you......the experts!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance for any assistance you could give me!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Melodii (Bard of 11 seasons)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Free E-Cards, Screensavers, and Digital Pictures!<br/>\n&gt; Corbis.com:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3358/7/_/451022/_/955635223/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3358/7/_/451022/_/955635223/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
