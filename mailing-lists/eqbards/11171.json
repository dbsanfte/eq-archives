However, even if we grant this, we<br/>\nstill have to ask when the programmer that&#39;s working on the other zone<br/>\nwarping bugs, and the zone bounceback bug between qhills and w karana is<br/>\ngoing to finally finish his fix. After all, both these bugs have been<br/>\nthere and reported since beta. Maybe they could assign those bugs to the<br/>\nprogrammer who is so diligent and fast at fixing those bugs that<br/>\nactually are slightly convenient to players instead of the bugs that<br/>\ncompletely disconvenience and annoy players. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
