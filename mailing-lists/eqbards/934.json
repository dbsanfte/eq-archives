Is it an area <br/>\n     effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a step <br/>\n     by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group <br/>\n     of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>\n     <br/>\n*************************<br/>\nThe way the lull spell works is that it is not an Area effect.  It is a<br/>\nsingle target spell.  What you do is you select one of the Mob in turn and<br/>\nplay the song.  You will see a text saying that they are sad.  Do this to<br/>\nall of the MOB except for the one you want to fight.  This spell will only<br/>\neffect up to 4 MOB.  What I do when I hunt orc&#39;s camp is that I would lull<br/>\nthe other 3 then I would play my bellow song on the one I did not lull and<br/>\nback off out of range of the rest of the MOB and attack that one.  Then<br/>\nrepeat the step for the other 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hoped this help.<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard,<br/>\nHammerpaw and Samiam</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
