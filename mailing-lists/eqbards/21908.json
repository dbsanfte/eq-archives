Nice one!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI will always remember my first Nagafen - it was New Year&#39;s Eve &#39;99 - we won<br/>\n=) I may have gotten my Selo&#39;s Drums that night - or perhaps sometime after.<br/>\nI fell in the lava 2 times.  First time fell off the big ramp and clutched<br/>\nto the wall while they killed some fire giants.  I yelled for help and was<br/>\namazed to see one of our rangers jump in and swimm in the lava to come get<br/>\nme.  My previous lava experience had been in Sol-A (15 levels lower) where I<br/>\ndied very fast. He showed me how to swim out.  A bit later, I fell in again<br/>\nand swam out myself.  Several Naggy runs later, Naggy fell in the lava and<br/>\nwe had to jump in to finish him off!  Someone also dove in and looted him<br/>\nunder-lava!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo grats!  Nice to see you enjoy a really fun part!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nMinstrel, somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Legba Work [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 12, 2000 11:24 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Elfson DragonSlayer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I was bored last night, playing my warrior twink (I will only play<br/>\nElfson with guildies and for big raids now that he is 47), and I get a tell<br/>\nthat a group has cleared the fire giants but has decided they are a bit weak<br/>\nto drop Naggy, so &quot;How fast can you get your blue butt up to SolB?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWoohoo!  My first dragon run!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were pretty experienced at this, so things went very smoothly (one<br/>\nmelee group bit it when their bard went down), and he dropped very quickly<br/>\n(or so it seemed to me).  I was in the xp group, which is a nice bonus...<br/>\n<br/>\nHe even dropped his drum, which was given (deservedly so) to ther other bard<br/>\nthere who had been on several Naggy raids in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy original EQ goal has been accomplished!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
