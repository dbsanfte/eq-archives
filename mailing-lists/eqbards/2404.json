I<br/>\ncan verify this because on my second trip I saw the rock that I had swam to<br/>\njust before the boat zoned.  Now that I am in the water, I have two choices.<br/>\nHow would you &quot;Roleplay&quot; this?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can try to swim to Butcherblock or swim all the way back across the Ocean<br/>\nof Tears to the dock to catch the next boat.   I realize that Butcherblock<br/>\nis much closer.  So I use my Sense Heading and examine the sun/moon to<br/>\nfigure out which is East.  Then I head in the opposite direction (because<br/>\nthe zone was put in backwards).  Soon I realize that I am not making any<br/>\nprogress.  There is some invisible shield blocking my progress.  The boat<br/>\npasses through this shield with no problems.  Well, I&#39;ll swim back to<br/>\nFreeport.  After a long swim I find the same shield is blocking Freeport.<br/>\nOK, so I&#39;ll hail the boat as it comes by and the boat will stop and rescue<br/>\nme.  Here it comes.  Everyone on the boat sees me and is yelling.  But the<br/>\nboat doesn&#39;t stop.  No one bothers to throw a rope down to me.  It just<br/>\nleaves me in the ocean.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might think that was roleplaying, but I don&#39;t.  Even if I accepted your<br/>\nmythical wave that &quot;knocked&quot; me off the boat, I still can&#39;t do any of the<br/>\nother things that I would want to do that would extract myself from this<br/>\nsituation.  I consider the game&#39;s roleplaying options &quot;broken&quot; at this point<br/>\nso I see no problem with using /loc in this situation, even for the die-hard<br/>\nroleplayers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually /petitioned a GM and got moved to the island with the dock.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Boat Problems<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In my mind I can justify gadgetry that is intended as part of the game or<br/>\n&gt;is separate from the game but can in a reasonable way be considered part of<br/>\n&gt;the game, such as this mailing list or externally obtained maps.  Mailing<br/>\n&gt;lists and maps are straightforward ways for people to exchange information<br/>\n&gt;and can be kept somewhat in game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My problem is using programming internals to further my ability to beat the<br/>\n&gt;computer program.  That&#39;s not the game I want to play.  It&#39;s too much like<br/>\n&gt;disassembling code to decypher the operating system so I can write whizbang<br/>\n&gt;programs of my own, or getting playing hints by printing out all the text<br/>\n&gt;messages from the software.  That&#39;s playing the computer system, not the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>game.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;/loc and the grid system are program mechanisms, not a game world feature.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is an old, familiar argument.  I&#39;ve had it before about exploiting<br/>\n&gt;rule glitches in live roleplaying games.  Some people do because they get<br/>\n&gt;more power.  Others won&#39;t because they want to play the fantasy game, not<br/>\n&gt;the external rules.  I&#39;m of the latter group and as a game rules designer<br/>\n&gt;tried to eliminate the abilities of the former.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bob </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
