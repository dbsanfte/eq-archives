Bards max at 40 foraging, right?<br/>\n2. At what level do you usually reach 40 skill foraging?<br/>\n3. Have any of you bards managed to forage something other than berries,<br/>\nfruit, rabbit meat, roots, veggies and water? And at what skill level did<br/>\nyou get it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone know about druids? (Like, if you have a druid, what is his skill cap<br/>\nand has he found any of the items, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nDaleia<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
