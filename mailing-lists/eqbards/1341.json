There are<br/>\nslightly diminishing returns on stats above 100, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend<br/>\nsurpassing 100 on any given stat.  I would recommend putting an extra 5<br/>\npoints into agility, just to bring it to 100 (that is for a Wood Elf).  Then<br/>\nthe rest are up to you.  I brought my Str up to 80, since wearing plate is a<br/>\ngood thing as a bard, though some might argue that you should put points<br/>\ninto charisma so that the songs you sing have stronger effect.  I&#39;ve not<br/>\nwitnessed any change when I have my enchanter friend buff me with<br/>\nSympathetic Aura, so I&#39;d say the added effect is slight.  Dex is nice so you<br/>\ncan twist songs with greater ease.  Nothing is more embarrassing for a bard<br/>\nthan a frog in the throat.  As a wood elf, your Stamina is fairly low,<br/>\naround 65 starting I believe, and I find that since i kept my stamina low I<br/>\ntend to run out of it almost after every fight.  Songs drain stamina quite a<br/>\nbit.  It will also help to curb the naturally low HP of a bard.  So you can<br/>\nsee many stats are useful for a bard, follow your heart and you&#39;ll do fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nKa`Lend, Wood Elven Bard on Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Steve Fogle [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steve.fogle@...\">steve.fogle@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 2:18 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] New Bard...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Steve Fogle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steve.fogle@...\">steve.fogle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m new to this list....<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to start a new Bard.
