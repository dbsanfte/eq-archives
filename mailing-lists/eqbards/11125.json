But a good base stat to make sure you boost is cha<br/>\n- cha helps many mid-level songs. Dex is said to help us start and stop<br/>\nsongs so dex is good to tweak too. Str will help you with weight as well as<br/>\nhow hard you hit.  Sta is somewhat ignored but it does add to your hp and<br/>\nbards die usually first and maybe a bit of hp might help.  Int is supposed<br/>\nto help you learn your skills faster.  We have lots to learn - besides 1hs,<br/>\n1hb & piercing, there is singing, percussion, string, brass and wind skills<br/>\nto maintain, not mention the standard sense heading, swimming, fishing, etc<br/>\netc.  Most bards are pretty low on wis - hell if we had wisdom, we&#39;d be<br/>\nplaying another class ;p<br/>\n<br/>\nCha, Dex, Str, Agi?, Sta?, Int<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, since most all get boosted later in life by magic items and<br/>\njewels, instead of really maxing one out, just tweaking each of them up<br/>\nclose or closer to 100 should be good so that later on you are not overly<br/>\ndeficient in any stat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you play your instrument and melee attack a mob, you use hand to hand<br/>\nskill. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and keep us posted!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 37th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tFriday, December 03, 1999 11:35 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] newbie stuff<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHi all, I&#39;m making a bard as a secondary character to my<br/>\ncleric.  Just<br/>\n\t\ta<br/>\n\t\tfew basic questions, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re hearing for the 4356th<br/>\ntime on the<br/>\n\t\tlist.  Sorry for the clutter... (But to be honest all the<br/>\nonline guides<br/>\n\t\tI found were useless)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tStats, stats, stats...  To str or not to str... Tis better<br/>\nto dex<br/>\n\t\tthan...<br/>\n\t\tIn other words, what are your thoughts on starting stats?  I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n\t\tthinking of making a half elf, since I want the better<br/>\nvision, and I&#39;ve<br/>\n\t\tplayed a wood elf before...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWhat skill is used when you kabong somebody with your lute?<br/>\nHand to<br/>\n\t\thand?  1HB?  I figured it would be worth a practice for all<br/>\nthose times<br/>\n\t\tI attack with an instrument...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAny other general starting advice?  I won&#39;t be twinking<br/>\nmyself with my<br/>\n\t\tcleric.  (who was started on a new server for me (veeshan)<br/>\nto prevent<br/>\n\t\tmy<br/>\n\t\tfirst character from twinking him) (not a judgment on<br/>\ntwinkers, I just<br/>\n\t\tthink it detracts from the fun, to each their own)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t  You can even make $$$ in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n\t\t&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click<br/>\nHere&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\t\tPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
