If you&#39;re 28th through 38th-ish I implore you to try<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule.  I&#39;ve said it before: There&#39;s a learning curve to the place,<br/>\n&gt; but if you can get into a competent and reasonably balanced group in the<br/>\n&gt; throne room, Archon temple top or alligators at the green and blue pools you<br/>\n&gt; will be amazed at the experience and loot.  If you&#39;re unfamiliar with CT and<br/>\n&gt; need a hand figuring the place out *please* just ask.  I cannot stress how<br/>\n&gt; well I did in this place from 28th-37th.  I made TONS of experience: A full<br/>\n&gt; level one Saturday at 31st and, and all of 30th in three evenings.  All the<br/>\n&gt; while I was staggering under the weight of fine steel weapons and 1-4pp<br/>\n&gt; drops.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Two nights ago I was hunting Spectres in Feerrott and was in a fair amount<br/>\n&gt; of danger for pretty minimal exp.  My group was complaining about this so I<br/>\n&gt; said &quot;Hey, Cazic-Thule is right here, let&#39;s go in there.&quot;  To which two of<br/>\n&gt; my members replied along the lines of &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know Cazic well, only<br/>\n&gt; been in there once or twice.&quot; so under my urging we went there and took the<br/>\n&gt; upper throne room.  My group was utterly amazed.  I got one and a half<br/>\n&gt; bubbles exp. in the two or three hours that we were there before I logged,<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;m 37th!  My group *did* benefit from my 9 levels of experience and<br/>\n&gt; Lament though (I was pulling).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Crier Sharpsong<br/>\n&gt; Obnoxious about Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [snip about hunting cyclops in Rathe Mts.]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Once I make 30th level, I plan on making this spot my home until I get out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of hell level.  I heard that Highkeep basement was the best place<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to safely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get out of 30th hell level because of its safety factor but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think camping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cyclops by the Lake zone in Rathe may actually be better (assuming you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; canget in a group).  You have the zone for the safety factor plus the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cyclops spawn rate is much faster than pickclaws.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
