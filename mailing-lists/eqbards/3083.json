I suspect we&#39;ve uncovered an unspoken detail.  I have noticed when I<br/>\nuse the keyboard to twist I can go too fast and not be able to start the<br/>\nnext because the previous hasn&#39;t quite finished.  That doesn&#39;t happen with<br/>\nthe mouse.  Sounds like the mouse has a built-in delay due to being less<br/>\nresponsive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Also, just dl&#39;d Roger Wilco nad have used it ingame while grouping with<br/>\n&gt;other people in my guild that have it... WOW!  It makes SUCH a difference!<br/>\n&gt;Voice communication while in-game, that doesn&#39;t take away from CPU-usage<br/>\n&gt;that any of us have been able to notice.

We&#39;ve been trying to use it with EverQuest, but one<br/>\nguy keeps having trouble that he can&#39;t transmit.  It&#39;s frustrating with<br/>\nEverQuest because when Roger gets sick you have to completely leave EQ to<br/>\nfix it.  Leading to:<br/>\n<br/>\nEverQuest has the most frustrating, baroque, complicated, step-filled,<br/>\nugly, memoryless way in and out of it that I&#39;ve had the displeasure of<br/>\nusing.  It clacks back and forth between screen resolutions, forces me to<br/>\ninteract in repetative, silly ways, takes way too long timing out on link<br/>\nfailures, and doesn&#39;t give me options for hurrying it along, such as a way<br/>\nto break out of the timer when I&#39;m sure my link is dead.  It even gives me<br/>\na frustrating peek at my screen, showing me that the link has failed, then<br/>\ngoes through attempts and timeouts trying to get back to the login server<br/>\nwhen it&#39;s completely hopeless, so I can click in three (!) different places<br/>\nto make it go away and reconnect.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things about EverQuest are outstanding.  Some are abysmal.  Obviously<br/>\nthe plusses outweigh the minusses for me, but oh, what it could be with<br/>\nsome of the easier minusses fixed....<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
