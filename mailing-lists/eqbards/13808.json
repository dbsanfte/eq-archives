The hate mail they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2115318747\">LOL.  Worry not Golias, I never take things here personally, well okay there<br/>\nis one exception I won&#39;t specify but that was way out there.  The hate mail<br/>\nthey get is a big part of the problem, exacerbated by the clientele they<br/>\nhave.  Most of the people on this board are educated, civil, and reasonable.<br/>\nUnfortunately, for every one of us there are 50 teenagers or even non-teens<br/>\nwho just want to spew their hate wherever they find a shot.  They&#39;d be far<br/>\nbetter off to just ignore the hateful posts and never, ever reply to them.<br/>\nIf they only replied to or addressed the reasonably polite posts I think<br/>\nthey&#39;d see a change.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do wonder how many &#39;false&#39; complaints they get.  If you remember my<br/>\nexperience with the GM on E&#39;ci who literally accused me of writing a program<br/>\nto allow windows debugger to crash EQ when I was about to die, you&#39;d know<br/>\ntheir policy is to treat all complaints as false unless patently proved<br/>\notherwise.  I even had a page fault screenshot to send in, which I did, and<br/>\nthey still refused to help me in any way.  It was pretty sad.  In Verant&#39;s<br/>\neyes the customer is not only always wrong, he&#39;s a lying cheat who will do<br/>\nanything to gain any advantage over the game.  Starting off with that as<br/>\nyour basic customer service assumption is not particularly comforting, but<br/>\nis nearly word for word what the GM told me their position was.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they&#39;ll get more thanks when we see how they implement the change to<br/>\nbard taunt and how it works.  I think at this point most people fear it will<br/>\nbe like the three new spells they gave us that could only be cast on<br/>\nourselves, yet were DoT&#39;s.  They&#39;ve built up a lot of skepticism in me and<br/>\nmany other bards that they even know how to make a change to us that works.<br/>\nHopefully Galtin is right and things are changing for the better.  Warrior&#39;s<br/>\nhave gotten a new offensive skill, who knows maybe we will get another<br/>\ndefensive skill.  I can but dream.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 4:02 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] WAaahooo!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you that they can get pretty touchy, but look at the outright<br/>\nhatred they get on the boards.  They addressed Bard Taunt and got a barely<br/>\naudible murmur of approval or thanks.  They change an animation which is a<br/>\ntrivial thing, and get 5 new hate threads on how they suck in the EQ boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only that, but how many zillions of false complaints do you think they<br/>\nget<br/>\nevery day, like the Necro Pet Stealth Nerf that never happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure they could be better, but I&#39;d have gone berserk by now :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias, who promised to leave this thread....I suck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n$20 OFF PURCHASES FOR YOUR PET AT PETOPIA.COM!<br/>\nTreat your pet to $20 off all the food, toys & treats your pet desires when <br/>\nyou purchase $30 or more!
