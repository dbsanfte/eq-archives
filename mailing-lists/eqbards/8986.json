I was standing on<br/>\nReaver Hill in E Karana near the river watching some higher level folks pull<br/>\nsome gnolls so I could get some cool screenshots.  I was playing no song,<br/>\njust standing there watching their ranger pull an undead reaver and 2<br/>\nregular gnolls back to the group.  As they came over the rise I watched all<br/>\n3 gnolls actually catch, and pass!, the ranger pulling them.  As I watched<br/>\nconfused lining up my screenshot the 3 gnolls ran right over the top of the<br/>\nranger&#39;s two mates, getting nuked as they came, and immediately proceeded to<br/>\nbeat on me!  I was at full health at the time, not playing anything, and not<br/>\neven in the group with the puller.  Fortunately I made it to the zone with a<br/>\nbubble of health left.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rokenn Swiftsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 22, 1999 9:57 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard Hate...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of bard hate, last night in Lower Guk our party is fighting a <br/>\nfrog shamen.
