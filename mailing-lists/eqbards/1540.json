Everything was going great for<br/>\nabout an hour, until we decided to pull a few evil eyes.  While doing this I<br/>\nequipped the drum.  After the first couple eyes we are all sitting there<br/>\nresting, and everything from goblins and minor muds all the way up to chasms<br/>\nand  evil eyes would come barreling out of the intersection once they got<br/>\nwithin a certain range of us, although our resting area was normally well<br/>\nout of the &quot;reaction&quot; zone we had previously been experiencing prior to my<br/>\nusing the drum.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did not attribute it to the drum at that time, but it was definitely the<br/>\nsame effect.  So bad did it turn out to be that we had to leave the maze<br/>\naltogether, because all of the crits seemed super aggressive.  By the way,<br/>\nthis was well after those couple of days where the creature aggressiveness<br/>\nwas all messed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon, 22nd Rank Bard of Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to:<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHowever, I discovered inadvertently in the process<br/>\nthat playing songs that use the drum seem to REALLY anger mobs a lot<br/>\nmore..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
