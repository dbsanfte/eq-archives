You need to know how to organize groups, buff people,<br/>\npull stuff, battle tactics, and loot rules.  It&#39;s probably impossible to do this effectively if you&#39;re<br/>\nessentially doing &quot;pickup&quot; groups each time.  Buffing alone can take hours if you don&#39;t have it organized<br/>\nwell up front.
