I&#39;d estimate I&#39;m missing notes about 10%-20%<br/>\n&gt;of the time on low-level songs (will have to test it some time<br/>\n&gt;this week).  If it&#39;s worse with lower charisma, I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt;how any of you are able to stand it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  With 95 charisma (base) I miss on around 20% of my songs.<br/>\n  Mind you, not level 22 or 23 songs, I&#39;m talking about Jig,<br/>\n  Selo&#39;s, and Hymm.  It&#39;s truly embarrassing.  It&#39;s like a<br/>\n  level 25 cleric fizzling minor heal.  I like to group with<br/>\n  players who are around 4 to 8 levels higher than I am, and<br/>\n  it makes bards look pretty bad.  Needless to say, I feedback&#39;d<br/>\n  the amount of missed notes I was getting recently, because<br/>\n  it wasn&#39;t like this before.

I played my bard again a couple hours<br/>\n&gt;tonight, and half the time I didn&#39;t even know what was going<br/>\n&gt;on or what song effects I had up because I was so busy trying<br/>\n&gt;to watch for and recover from missed notes.  It is very<br/>\n&gt;frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  You and me both brother.  I&#39;m too busy pushing hotkeys to<br/>\n  start songs, getting bashed, and figuring out which songs<br/>\n  played, which ended, which never even started...
