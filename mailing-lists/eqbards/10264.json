Hmmm, wonder<br/>\nwhere I died last knight??? I vaguely remember something about South Karana.<br/>\nGuess I&#39;ll head that way and check it out.  Zone to HH: you have no corpses<br/>\nin the zone. Zone to EK: you have no corpses in the zone. Zone to NK: you<br/>\nhave no corpses in the zone. Zone to SK: you cannot summon that corpse from<br/>\nhere.  Ahh!  Time to mem Lyssia! =)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr I have come back to the screen and the text buffer is spammed with:<br/>\nyou are hungry<br/>\nyou are thristy<br/>\nyou are out of food<br/>\nyou are out of drink<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at my health bars and sta is at zero.  And I am either blocking a zone,<br/>\nor nose against some far zone wall, or standing idly in the Gfay wiz spires<br/>\n(I fall alseep zoning or traveling and either die, hit a wall, stay at zone<br/>\nor my wiz fiends have been known to tele me to Gfay and leave me in the<br/>\nrelative safety there ;p)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even when I am awake, dungeons and me simply get me all mixed up. I get<br/>\nlost really easy.  My group gets real sick of leading me and out all the<br/>\ntime.  Run to the zone?  You got to be kidding! Of course, it dont help when<br/>\nthe route you take in is different from the route to run out and you never<br/>\npractice the run out (which I do now - when they take me somewhere new) &quot;ok,<br/>\njump down here..&quot;  Jump here? How the hell am I supposed to get out???<br/>\n(Sol-a, Perma, and Lguk all have spots like that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the new places we got to now - you got to have an evac person or be<br/>\nprepared to fite your way in and back out.  We spent a long knight in Lguk<br/>\nFrenzied room.  At 3am as we were heading out, we decided to check the Exe<br/>\nroom but someone lost invis in the middle of the jail.  Soon we had more<br/>\nthan 10-15 froogies on us (full party of 6).  We paniced. Someone said Zone<br/>\nand we bolted.  Now the number of froggies doubled.  I died real fast.  I<br/>\nthink 3 of the party made the zone.  We should have stood our ground and<br/>\nfought.  We had an enchanter who 10 of the mezzed.  All we had to do was<br/>\nkill them one by one. But we paniced and ran and that did half of us in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to answer your question, MOST of the time I know pretty much where I am<br/>\nbut if I am ever in doubt I just do /w sylly all and it tells me zactly<br/>\nwhich zone I am in and then I am fine =)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 36th Song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. one time after helping someone get their corpse outta Runnyeye, we are<br/>\nSelos back from Gorge to HH ramp and go thru that canyon by the shops.  I<br/>\nsee this corpse laying there and think: hmm, wonder who the fool was that<br/>\ndied here? So, I target and guess what? &quot;a Sylly corpse0&quot; Hehe, it&#39;s ME!!!<br/>\nSo, I go over and loot it - WOW so that&#39;s where my spare drum went!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: JasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 1:04 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] dual weild<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly,<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading your recent posts about being lost all of the time, I have to<br/>\nask about your signature.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 36th Song<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you say &quot;somewhere on Innoruuk&quot; because you don&#39;t know *where* exactly??<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
