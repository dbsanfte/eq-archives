A L35 bard with a<br/>\nMistmoore drum is slightly slower than 2x running speed, a L36<br/>\nbard with a MM drum is slightly faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no real answer to &quot;when is Selo&#39;s as fast as SoW&quot;<br/>\nbecause SoW becomes faster as the caster levels.  But if you<br/>\nextrapolate my results to the lower levels, Accel is *always*<br/>\nfaster than like-level SoW.  Based on some timings I&#39;ve yet to<br/>\nsend to Rokken, Accel with a drum at about L15 is faster than<br/>\nL49 SoW, and a L40 bard without a drum is faster than L49 SoW.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Damn, I&#39;ve been walking all this time...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
