I<br/>\nkeep seeing them sold for a gold or two in stores, can&#39;t resist picking a<br/>\nfew up (heard folks trying to sell them for platinum).  When I right-click,<br/>\nI am informed it can only be used by a bard and that it is magical.  I&#39;m<br/>\njust wondering what the magical effect is?  Anyone know?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not certain if it is wind or brass.  A horn, I assume, is a brass<br/>\ninstrument type.  Of course this can be easily tested, simply by<br/>\nseeing an effect while wielding it with different songs.  Just buy<br/>\nit from a store, find yourself,  but not from someone for platinum!<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Webmistress &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webmistress@...\">webmistress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: EQ Bards List &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, April 19, 1999 11:46 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Minotaur Horns<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Webmistress &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webmistress@...\">webmistress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As I recently achieved a level that allows me to begin sharpening my<br/>\n&gt;skills on wind instruments, I will be looking to acquire a proper<br/>\n&gt;instrument shortly.
