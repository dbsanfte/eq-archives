If you are paying by the<br/>\nminute, then playing an engrossing online game may be too high<br/>\nan expense to begin with, whether or not you can bind nearby.<br/>\nI have friends with over 100 days played time. Even friends<br/>\nthat can bind nearby, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my friends in England, though are on unlimited plans. They<br/>\nare evidently expensive. But that is how they keep their phone<br/>\nbills from skyrocketing. It is not Verant&#39;s fault that England<br/>\ndoes their billing of phone calls that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad has addressed this question. He has said it&#39;s not changing Feel free<br/>\nto complain about it still But nothing is going to change. So its just<br/>\ncomplaining at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, January 12, 2000 8:32 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Brad On Binding (OT)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yeah, it&#39;s still a risk that we shouldn&#39;t have to take, if one of those<br/>\n&gt;bouncers gets a stun on you then you&#39;re dead, especially as there are 2<br/>\n&gt;outside oggok.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just think that bind affinity should work in all outsdoor zones (be it a<br/>\n&gt;city, swamp, desert, commons etc), and there should be a Yes/No box like<br/>\n&gt;res, this way people can&#39;t bind someone where they don&#39;t want to be bound.<br/>\n&gt;This would stop people from binding inside dungeons and save peoples time<br/>\n&gt;if they die.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I come from England and over here we have to pay for our calls, they are<br/>\n&gt;charged by the minute. Now this soon adds up and when I have to waste time<br/>\n&gt;running across 6 zones to my corpse I&#39;m gonna be pissed. Aswell as having<br/>\n&gt;to mem songs and spend an hour getting back the exp I lost. My monthly<br/>\n&gt;phone bill is roughly ´┐¢100-120, in $ I would probably say it is about<br/>\n&gt;$150-175 per month.
