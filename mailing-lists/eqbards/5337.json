Here","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1329913354\">At 24th level I have found that I am pretty happy with my armor choices with<br/>\na few exceptions, I would like some advice on this if anyone has an opinion.<br/>\nHere is what I have now:<br/>\n<br/>\nBanded Helm - not magic but I would hate to give up the 8AC points for the<br/>\nmuch heavier blackened crown with less AC and the same silly half-elf<br/>\ndonut-looking graphic that I am tiring of.  I heard that Hatar (named low<br/>\n20s sand giant in Oasis) drops a Fine Silk Turban with 10AC .1 weight and<br/>\n+10 fire resist that does not have a texturemap on my character, which would<br/>\nbe cool if it is so, but I have never seen one to verify.  I would love a<br/>\ncrested helm for the looks and bonuses but I don&#39;t know where to find it or<br/>\nhow much they are<br/>\n<br/>\nBanded Mask - Dying to get the Guise of the deceiver, guess I should go to a<br/>\nbazaar and hope for the best - can&#39;t go to lower guk yet at 24th<br/>\n<br/>\nAmulet of Thunder - this is a neck item I got from Drosco in the Qeynos<br/>\nSewers, has 2AC and +5CHA, I like the bonuses, replaced the Spiked Collar<br/>\n(3AC +3STR) for it<br/>\n<br/>\nBloodstained Mantle - best AC and magic bonus shoulder piece for some time<br/>\nto come as far as I can tell within my ability to afford or obtain myself<br/>\n<br/>\nBanded Tunic - Once again the AC can&#39;t be beat for a reasonable price unless<br/>\nI go to a medium bronze breastplate, and then the AC vs weight ratio seems<br/>\nnot worth the upgrade - steel is way out of my price range and obtaining<br/>\nbetter items at my level is seemingly impossible unless I buy them - I am<br/>\nnot keen on the bloodstained tunic because again, same graphic as banded<br/>\nwith a reddish tint and less AC with magic bonuses that I am not all that<br/>\ninterested in as a bard - really want some kind of breastplate for a more<br/>\nrefined and respectable look.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbed Arms - same AC as banded with magic bonuses, same graphic as banded<br/>\n<br/>\nBanded Bracers - Nice AC to weight ratio, not sure what would be better for<br/>\nme at this time<br/>\n<br/>\nElf-Hide gloves - love the bonuses, AC is decent, probably stick with these<br/>\nas I am into RP and don&#39;t like the idea of myself playing a lute with metal<br/>\ngauntlets - oh, and to me they are dark-elf-hide ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPurity Belt - wore a thick leather apron for a while and decided on the<br/>\npurity belt, the AC bonuses are terrible comparatively but the stats on the<br/>\npurity belt are nice, just waiting to get a trollhide belt which has higher<br/>\nAC and same magic bonuses as the purity belt, but better increases<br/>\n<br/>\nBlackened Leggings - purely vanity, love the look of the black banded pants<br/>\non my half-elf, even though they are heavier and 1 AC less than Banded, only<br/>\nthing I would trade them in on now would be Barbed Legplates if I could find<br/>\nthem because they are lighter, same AC as banded, and have AGI bonuses<br/>\n<br/>\nBanded boots -  just waiting for a chance to get some Dwarven work boots<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 2 Opalline earrings that I am proud to wear because I killed the mob<br/>\nand looted them myself, a +5AGI ring and a +2INT ring (with base INT it<br/>\ntakes me forever to increase my skills)<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo...I have the following balance stats with all this:<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR 100<br/>\nAGI 100<br/>\nDEX 104 (with dragoon dirk equipped)<br/>\nWIS 60 (base with no mods)<br/>\nINT 77<br/>\nCHA 105<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions from you masters out there for this level 24 fellow are very<br/>\nwelcome.  Anyone on E&#39;ci who wants to be my benefactor and twink me up is<br/>\neven more welcome ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Faras &quot;I wear a donut on my head&quot; Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n  E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Arwen [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arwen@...\">arwen@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 2:56 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Bard armour<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Arwen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arwen@...\">arwen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;So anyway, are there any suggestions about the type of armour I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get that will be lighter?  Looking for cheap alternatives, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;somewhere to go murder things and steal their armour.  I can even go<br/>\n&gt; &gt;out and deal with (most) wisps as a steady source of income if cheap<br/>\n&gt; &gt;isn&#39;t possible ;-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Melaniel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Wood Elf Bard (11), Mith Marr server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would suggest a bloodstained tunic, lizzie scale mantle and <br/>\n&gt; cloack, and<br/>\n&gt; blackend armor for the rest.  Looks great and if weight is an <br/>\n&gt; issue it will<br/>\n&gt; help alot. Yes the armor is NICE to have..I persoanlly wear a combo of<br/>\n&gt; charred plate and bronze right now, but i have so many <br/>\n&gt; strength enhancers it<br/>\n&gt; isnt even funny! As a young bard the above items will be abit <br/>\n&gt; above your<br/>\n&gt; level for now..but well within the grasp of a rich bard..so <br/>\n&gt; get your mage to<br/>\n&gt; support you (LOL). Good luck to you Melaniel.
