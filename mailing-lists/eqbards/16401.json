I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not sure how it could be fixed now, or if even it could without a lot of<br/>\n&gt; pain.  I sure hope it is something they realize for EQ2 however.  I wonder<br/>\n&gt; how bad it would really be if they took a stab at it.  Reduced the hp&#39;s of<br/>\n&gt; all the mobs to the original pre buffed numbers and fixed the dual wield<br/>\n&gt; problem.  It might appear ugly at first, but I think it would put the game<br/>\n&gt; back onto the track they think it is on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Very well stated.  I found myself in agreement on all your points.<br/>\n  You just knocked down that nail with a Butcherblock Hammer.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Verant is too protective of their game.  If somehow I figured<br/>\n  out that a certain combination of skills and spells and classes<br/>\n  made a dragon or a god 50% easier to conquer - the next patch<br/>\n  would have a &#39;fix&#39; for it.  Verant doesn&#39;t want you to succeed<br/>\n  from strategy, Abashi has made that clear.  They want you to<br/>\n  throw players and deaths at something to accomplish your goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Verant in that way is like a 12 yr old GM who always wants his<br/>\n  way.  If you overcome his trap he set for you, he throws a tantrum<br/>\n  and you all of a sudden randomly encounter a mob who kills you<br/>\n  in a few rounds.  I&#39;ve played with GMs like this.  I&#39;ve GM&#39;d games<br/>\n  myself and that temptation is there.  Verant feels like players<br/>\n  are getting the better of them, and they need to separate this<br/>\n  ownership and concentrate on making better more challenging areas.<br/>\n  I&#39;m kinda glad the private npc hp variable is a signed 2 byte <br/>\n  integer.  Serves them right:  No monster can have more than 32768<br/>\n  hit points.  They won&#39;t be pulling this &#39;just up the hp&#39; bullsh*t<br/>\n  anymore.  Then again, they have other ridiculous options.  Like<br/>\n  melee in the thousands, deathtouch(sm), and other countless 12 yr<br/>\n  GM tactics.  If they would only design their game around the<br/>\n  mechanical foundation they put in place, they&#39;d be ok.  Instead<br/>\n  what does DEX really do?  What does AGI really do?  My CHA doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  amount to much as long as it&#39;s over 100.  It makes me think they<br/>\n  wanted to base their system around a 100 point scale for stats.<br/>\n  You get diminishing return after 100, but you are heavily penalized<br/>\n  for having stats 75 or below.  I am doing twice as good with STR,<br/>\n  AC, and HP items.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If stats clearly made a difference...  If they would solve problems<br/>\n  instead of patching them with quick repairs... I think we&#39;d be <br/>\n  looking at an entire different (and fun) game.  As a player in any<br/>\n  RPG, the hooks are character advancement and items/accomplishments.<br/>\n  Verant is intent on making these two aspects of their game harder and<br/>\n  harder to the point where you don&#39;t feel rewarded for the effort.  Sure<br/>\n  the day I got my picollo and the day I got boots and helm from hate were<br/>\n  great, but that&#39;s not the norm.  That&#39;s the RNG working for a change.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Man this post is long... /yawn ;-)  I played a game last night called<br/>\n  Airport, Inc.  Sounded fun, looked cool, Airport Simulation, kinda<br/>\n  neat.  Fired it up, had a blast building my airport and laying it<br/>\n  all out.  But no matter what I did I couldn&#39;t make enough money to<br/>\n  keep the place running.  The tutorial with the game even couldn&#39;t<br/>\n  do it, and that&#39;s horrible when your demo can&#39;t even succeed.  I <br/>\n  tried different things, and in the end I was spinning my wheels.<br/>\n  Then I played Age of Wonders, (ala Warlords).  Another awesome<br/>\n  game on the front, but as I advanced through one of their campaigns<br/>\n  I noticed that I could only upkeep 3 or 4 units at each castle <br/>\n  until I started losing money.  I am the type of person who plays<br/>\n  defensive on all cases, and I like strong guarded towns/castles,<br/>\n  but this limitation forced me to give up the game after an hour<br/>\n  of playing it.  I just have really high expectation from games I<br/>\n  play.  If they don&#39;t allow advancement and the feeling of <br/>\n  accomplishment, I tend to give them up quickly.  Everquest sways<br/>\n  back and forth across that line.  Thus so does my playtime these<br/>\n  days.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
