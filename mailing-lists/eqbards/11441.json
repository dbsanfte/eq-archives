Brad leaves out the Charm nerf for levels over 35<br/>\nand the nerfing of Accelerando, which GZ himself admitted was a nerf, not a<br/>\nbug fix, and you think Brad&#39;s on target?  How about the reduction to our<br/>\nDoT&#39;s? another minus.  That&#39;s three big minuses in like 30 seconds, and Brad<br/>\ngot other developers input on his list?

You are<br/>\nmistaken however about our ability to hit magic only creatures.  Magic<br/>\ngloves only started working as a magic attack for anyone other then monks<br/>\nabout 4 patches ago IE about 2 months ago before that it was weapons or<br/>\nsongs and that was the only damage you did.  Now if we have a magic<br/>\ninstrument or gloves we can punch magic only for damage while using the<br/>\ninstrument.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAdon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
