We were doing fine,<br/>\n&gt; till this Lvl 50 Necro arrived and said... &quot;sorry to<br/>\n&gt; do this to you guys, but i need the faction&quot; he then<br/>\n&gt; proceeded to kill everything in site till i gave up<br/>\n&gt; and left 30 minutes later.   That is in reallity how<br/>\n&gt; sharing works...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And what did the guide say after you petitioned this lack of sharing?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t follow the &quot;play nice&quot; policy at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t let anyone walk over me regardless of their level. If I can&#39;t<br/>\nconvince them to share, then I&#39;d petition Verant and wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I&#39;d do is contact the person&#39;s guildmaster to find out if<br/>\nthis is an acceptable form of behavior from a guild member. I&#39;ve been<br/>\nfortunate to talk to several guildmasters who have reigned in one of theirs<br/>\nafter a complaint.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, what level do enchanters get charm? Couldn&#39;t you have charmed the<br/>\ncreatures away from him, worse comes to worse?<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
