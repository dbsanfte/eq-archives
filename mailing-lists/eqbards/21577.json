However, for<br/>\n&gt; pulls <br/>\n&gt; and healing I love the %t command. Nothing was sweeter than our puller <br/>\n&gt; saying &quot;/g inc %t&quot;, and having our enchanter say &quot;/g Mezzing %t&quot; and me <br/>\n&gt; saying &quot;/g Healing %t&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I convinced my enchanter friend that these are very handy and he loves <br/>\n&gt; them. The &quot;pause&quot; command didn&#39;t really work well for me with a caster,<br/>\n&gt; but <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure that just needs to be refined.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---Windleaf.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
