I hope <br/>\nthe following doesn&#39;t offend anyone, but if it does, feel free to flame me <br/>\npersonally or stick a pin in your nearest Windleaf voodoo doll.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I thought I&#39;d offer some tips on effective arguing. I&#39;m guilty of <br/>\nthe following and probably will continue to be, but it never hurts to have <br/>\na reminder:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Avoid making personal criticisms:<br/>\n   A) Avoid the use of the word &quot;you&quot;. Statements with &quot;you&quot; are taken <br/>\npersonally whether it&#39;s intended<br/>\n       or not and and generally puts people on the defensive. During the <br/>\nproofread, try removing any &quot;you&quot;<br/>\n       references.<br/>\n<br/>\n   B) No name calling. It&#39;s pretty easy to avoid calling someone a name, <br/>\nbut also avoid calling their ideas<br/>\n       names. For example, calling someone&#39;s idea &quot;dumb&quot; isn&#39;t going to <br/>\nmake them respect your<br/>\n       opinions and would probably make them ignore the point you were <br/>\ntrying to make.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Avoid analogies. It&#39;s hard to make a good analogy. But even if you make <br/>\na good one, people tend to start attacking your analogy or making up one on <br/>\ntheir own, and soon it degenerates to the point where everyone&#39;s arguing <br/>\nabout whether low gravity on a planet affects the local space time <br/>\ncontinuum. (I&#39;ve actually sat in on one degraded to this and tried my best <br/>\nto get away).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, an analogy tends to move the topic of discussion away from the <br/>\nactual facts and points.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) If making an opinion, back it up with good facts or analysis. Everyone <br/>\nknows everyone else has opinions, but they are going to ignore yours unless <br/>\nyou can back it up with good reasoning or hard evidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
