I just assumed that I would have to wait until I was around 30th<br/>\n&gt; level before starting.  I guess I have been lucky so far because I have<br/>\n&gt; been<br/>\n&gt; able to acquire six of the items.  For a few of them, guildmembers in<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; mid 30s helped me out.  For the others, people couldn&#39;t use/loot them them<br/>\n&gt; so they let me loot the items.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Always willing to take a risk, I&#39;m thinking about heading to Mistmoore<br/>\n&gt; after<br/>\n&gt; I get the bracelet in Unrest.  Need to get an idea of how tough the deadly<br/>\n&gt; usher and gypsy musicians are.  I hope to join with a higher level group<br/>\n&gt; (assuming they will accept a 25 bard in the group).  Assuming a full group<br/>\n&gt; of six, what level characters are required to fight against these mobs?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, the only places I&#39;ve gone to in Mistmoore are the initial areas<br/>\n&gt; beside<br/>\n&gt; the lake and the graveyard.  Nothing I ran into in those locations could<br/>\n&gt; see<br/>\n&gt; through the invisibility song.   Are there any mobs deeper in the zone<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; can See Invis?  I would assume that the DE casters can buff themselves<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; the spell.  Got a bad feeling that all the gargoyles can as well.  Still<br/>\n&gt; willing to take the chance though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
