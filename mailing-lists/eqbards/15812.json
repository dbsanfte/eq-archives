We had a shaman who was using Togors to slow them in every battle.  After a couple of hours, the shaman had to go and the slow responsibility became that of the enchanter in the party.  At that time we had changed over to include 2 mages, an enchanter, a druid and me, the mages and the enchanter each with pets.  Since my songs don&#39;t work on pets, I scrapped curtails (malise was more then enough), celerity (effects only me), chant (effects only me), for mana song only...  For the heck of it, I decided to mem up binding which I really haven&#39;t used since maybe 21rst level.  Next thing I know everyone is asking who is slowing the cyclops.  Everyone was pleasantly surprised to find out it was me.  I know the shaman slow downs vs. the bard are well documented.  Has anyone ever compared the enchanter line of spells in this regard to the bard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
