With a drum, Accelerando at<br/>\naround level 20+ is fast enough that in the time it takes a<br/>\ncaster to gate to town, run around to buy/sell, and run back<br/>\nto a dungeon, a bard can run back to town, run around to<br/>\nbuy/sell, and run back to the dungeon.  *All* my caster<br/>\nfriends, even the druids, are insanely jealous of how fast I<br/>\nrun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or better yet, high level bard & high level wizard in<br/>\n&gt; the same race.

You won&#39;t convince many people<br/>\narguing like that.  It&#39;s like saying because wizards cannot<br/>\nsurvive more than a couple hits against a high level mob if<br/>\nroot fails while a tank can last a minute, wizards should be<br/>\nallowed to wear plate.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll be much more convincing if you can give the best-case<br/>\nscenario, and still point out an imbalance.  Arguing like you<br/>\nhave been just makes you sound cynical and bitter, and thus<br/>\nnot impartial.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
