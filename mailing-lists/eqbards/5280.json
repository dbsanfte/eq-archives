He was a dangerous blue to me - so there was no way I could<br/>\nsolo him and in fact he did kill me even when I had help. He&#39;s a ranger or<br/>\ndruid - I don&#39;t know those classes well enough to say exactly but he would<br/>\nspawn and then buff himself with at least 3 buffs in a row - the 3rd one<br/>\nbeing shield of thorns - ouch!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when my blonde-ness wore off, I thought hmmm, what if I don&#39;t wait for<br/>\nhim to get all nice and thorny before schwacking him?  So, we&#39;d heal up then<br/>\nwhile my party - 2 rangers were medding I went over by his bedroom window to<br/>\npractice my brass skills - ya, ya I was just practicing - that&#39;s it!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly begins to practice her brass...<br/>\na hermit begins to cast a spell...(some kinda self-buff)<br/>\na hermit begins to cast a spell...(another self-buff)<br/>\na hermit winces...(hehe here is where he winces instead of casting thorns)<br/>\na hermit begins to cast a spell...(now he&#39;s mad but has forgotten to do the<br/>\nrest of his buffs)<br/>\nSylly is struck by a bolt of fire...(ok, doky time to come out and play<br/>\nherman!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - while this was not exactly interrupting his casting - in that I would<br/>\nsee only occasional interrupt messages by him - it did significantly affect<br/>\nhow he would fight us.  As soon as he spawned he gets his first spell off<br/>\nimmediately then when he got attacked by my Denon&#39;s - he stopped his buff<br/>\nroutine and switched to his attack mode.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the tip is - don&#39;t wait for him to spawn (which you know because you see<br/>\nhis buff casting) before you attack him - lay down a nice AE for him to<br/>\nspawn into.  Unless you like stabbing yourself with thorns &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 21st song<br/>\nSelling Swords and Such<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.  Harmonic Distortion gave a concert in BlackBurrow Paw Sunday<br/>\nafternoon.  It proved to be very popular because _every_single_gnoll_ in the<br/>\nwhole Burrow (and some of the married ones too!) came up to the top floor<br/>\nand gathered around Harmonic to hear his concert.  When he was done, a<br/>\ncertain druid named Estella who was also enjoying the concert, applauded the<br/>\nperformance with what sounded like the shock of an earthquake! The young<br/>\nadventurers in the Burrow were quite happy to loot the 30 or so gnolls who<br/>\ndied in that blast &lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tDarrian Ashoka [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dashoka@...\">dashoka@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tFriday, August 13, 1999 3:25 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Lullaby and interupting casting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Darrian Ashoka &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dashoka@...\">dashoka@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHere&#39;s my take on the whole issue.<br/>\n\t\tI&#39;m not sure of this but this is just a couple of<br/>\n\t\tobservations I have made using lullaby extensively.<br/>\n\t\t(Been using it a lot since I got it at level 15)<br/>\n\t\tEvery song pulses at every tick (6 seconds) as far as<br/>\n\t\tI can tell. And lullaby/nod is no exception. I think<br/>\n\t\tevery time nod pulses the mob has to make a savings <br/>\n\t\tcheck to see if it resists or not. Assume we have a<br/>\n\t\tspell caster that resisted it, and then it begins <br/>\n\t\tcasting. If the casting does not take more than 6 <br/>\n\t\tseconds, there is no chance that nod will be able to <br/>\n\t\tinterupt it. Since NPC casters do not suffer the same<br/>\n\t\tcasting time limitations as PC casters do, most are <br/>\n\t\table to get a spell off before the next pulse of nod <br/>\n\t\tand hence can cast without being interupted. However,<br/>\n\t\tsometimes when the mob resist nod, it attacks first and<br/>\n\t\tthen cast. When this happens, the attack and the casting<br/>\n\t\tmight not be complete within 6 seconds so when nod pulses <br/>\n\t\tagain and the mob fails the savings, then it is nodded<br/>\n\t\tand it&#39;s casting is interupted. This is what I seem to<br/>\n\t\tobserve a lot. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tDarrian Ashoka<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t_________________________________________________________<br/>\n\t\tDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\n\t\tBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tTransfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\n\t\tFor program details, go to<br/>\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
