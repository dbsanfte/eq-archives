Verant stated that the secondary resist rate against evens is supposed <br/>\nto be 35%, adjustable downwards by Charisma and instrument.  It&#39;s 70%, and <br/>\nisn&#39;t adjustable downwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  The intended 35% secondary resist rate is still ridiculously high, given <br/>\nthat Enchanter mez has a 5% resist.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Given the opportunity cost of singing Lullaby, e.g.:  1) we can do <br/>\nnothing else; 2) we get hit constantly thoughout the fight by the ones that <br/>\nwake up, taking a lot of damage; and 3) we can be stunned long enough to <br/>\nallow everything to wake up, it wouldn&#39;t overpower Enchanters even if it had <br/>\na zero secondary resist at this point.  Comparing the apparent effect <br/>\nwithout considering the fact that:  a) Enchanters can do plenty of <br/>\npre-buffing, and lots of other stuff in the meantime and b) we can&#39;t do <br/>\neither, is just dumb analysis on Verant&#39;s part.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ways to fix this song so it isn&#39;t overly powerful:  reduce the AE <br/>\nrange, put a minimum resist rate on it (15%, maybe).  Putting a secondary <br/>\nresist on that&#39;s so high as to render the song useless against more than <br/>\nthree MOBs is the wrong way to do it.  Making a mistake and putting a <br/>\nsecondary resist on that is MUCH higher than even the designers intended, <br/>\nand then leaving it in place for 9 months despite repeated complaints is <br/>\ninexcusable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think their attitude is that, if Bards can get to level 50+ by doing <br/>\nwithout it for nine months, then why bother?  I just wonder why they don&#39;t <br/>\nhave the same attitude when it comes to buffing Magician&#39;s pets?<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 51 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Merck wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do remember comments that it was riduculously powerful back when it did<br/>\n&gt; work.
