My guess is that dex much under 100 is considered sub standard -<br/>\nover & close 100 about &#39;normal&#39; - near or over 120 &#39;above average&#39; and above<br/>\nthat probably only marginally better.  I think that there are &quot;break points&quot;<br/>\nwhere if you get past them you see better results but that the result curve<br/>\nis not strictly linear. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are approximate numbers to illustrate the non-linear nature and point<br/>\nof diminishing returns.  I have no scientific data to back this up. But he<br/>\npoint is - some good base dex to get you at or close to 100 combind with<br/>\nsome typical dex items to get you over 110 and maybe near to 120 should do<br/>\npretty well. If songs then take the party over 130ish and give them other<br/>\nstats as well, you are doing prolly the best you can.  To overload on dex<br/>\nitems and buff over 140/150/160 prolly has marginal result and your<br/>\nslots/pp/buffs might be better spent on other stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Keith Mann [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keith@...\">keith@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 30, 1999 5:45 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Ykesha Procing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Keith Mann&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keith@...\">keith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless I&#39;m mistaken, Ykesha won&#39;t proc at all until level 38, so maybe proc<br/>\nfrequency has to do with level as well as dex.
