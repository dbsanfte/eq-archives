Mostly we get trivial bugs that reflect poorly thought out logistics,<br/>\nnot code.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, even Brian Hook said that they&#39;re a a talented bunch of programmers, and I<br/>\ndoubt you&#39;re unimpressed with his work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I don&#39;t mean this to be harsh, I just wonder what causes us to blame the<br/>\ncoders rather than the designers.<br/>\n<br/>\nUm, and that sign reversal thing does suck, btw.  You have a point there, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve done stupid things like that in my code before, and I bet you have, too :P<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my .02<br/>\nGolias, Sol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n===============<br/>\nWhich means that A) They&#39;ve tinkered with the original Diku experience<br/>\ntables (NEEDED!) and B) The Hell levels and the H+1 levels are either<br/>\nextremely intentional or some collosolly bad coding.  I&#39;d personally support<br/>\neither opinion equally.
