I am a level 26 bard.  I&#39;ve been getting in<br/>\nthe habit of going down to the guards area and breaking up the spawn in the<br/>\nouter guard room, and killing the two guards, and one officer there solo<br/>\n(no one there ever wants to party with me at the times I&#39;m there).  So, I<br/>\ndo my typical tactic using lament, and eventually pull the guard officer by<br/>\nhimself.  So I&#39;m fighting and he&#39;s pounding on me pretty good (I think<br/>\nthey&#39;re in the level 24-25 range), and I&#39;m using my typical round of songs:<br/>\n Warsong, Chain, Discord.  Well, 8 chain resists, and 6 discord resists<br/>\nlater, I had to fire up screech to get out of dodge.  2 screech resists,<br/>\nand 3 chain resists later, I limped out of the zone with less than half a<br/>\nbubble left, the officer still had greather than 60% health.  I have taken<br/>\nthe officers solo serveral times in the past.  I hope this was just the<br/>\nevil random number generator and not a sign of more nerfing of resist rates<br/>\nfor songs.  I never ONCE got him to be affected by Discord.  On the<br/>\nbrighter side, I never once resisted my own warsong.  heh.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni the Frustrated 26th level bard of E&#39;Ci.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteven S.
