My guild has been so successful in the Lake of Ill Omen zone<br/>\nthat our entire guild roster from level 17-24 now resides in that zone.  It<br/>\ntook me about a week to convince one person to try it, but once they<br/>\nrealized I had made two levels there in a week they knew it must be the land<br/>\nof milk and honey.  I just don&#39;t level that fast.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a full group pretty much every single night in that zone.  The<br/>\ngoblins, sabertooths, and sarnaks make for good xp and good loot.  Plenty of<br/>\nlesser icebones and lesser charbones as well.  I was easily able to solo<br/>\nthere as a bard at 24th level.  Our 22nd level bard found he could solo just<br/>\nas well so you should be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anywhere that a lvl 21 can fight on Kunark without being completely<br/>\nslaughtered? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nRemember four years of good friends, bad clothes, explosive chemistry<br/>\nexperiments.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4051/10/_/451022/_/958575663/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4051/10/_/451022/_/958575663/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
