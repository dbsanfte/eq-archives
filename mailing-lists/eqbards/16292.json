Got a flood of them today now that its working finally.<br/>\nThought I would comment on this topic as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy RL best friend bought AC and convinced me to buy it as well.  The price<br/>\nwas only $25 at COMPUSA and you get a month free so I figured even if I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like it I would get my money&#39;s worth.  After playing it for the past<br/>\nfew days and getting my character up to 5th level, all I can say right now<br/>\nis that I am thoroughly enjoying the game.  I played Rolemaster a lot in<br/>\ncollege and the way the stats and skills work in AC are very similar.  And<br/>\non the topic of stats and skills, they actually work.  When you increase any<br/>\nof these you get noticeable<br/>\neffects.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe original poster covered most of the pros and cons so I won&#39;t go into<br/>\nthose.  As it stands right now, I&#39;m going to keep my EQ account active for<br/>\nnow but I think, in the near future, I will end up spending most of my time<br/>\nplaying AC.  Here are the key factors why:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Get to play with my best friend online.  <br/>\n2)  AC is much better than EQ for casual gamers.  If you don&#39;t have but an<br/>\nhour or two to play, you can still log in and accomplish something.  Soloing<br/>\nis a viable alternative, whether outside or in a dungeon.<br/>\n3)  No overcrowding and therefore no fighting over spawns.<br/>\n4)  Fast respawn rate.  In the places I&#39;ve been so far, the respawn rate is<br/>\nsomewhere around 5 minutes.  Basically nonstop action no matter where you<br/>\nare at.<br/>\n5)  No camping.  Loot is randomized based on the level of the mob you are<br/>\nfighting. <br/>\n6)  No hell levels!!<br/>\n7)  No EXP loss when dying.  Vitae penalty worked off gradually as you kill<br/>\nmore mobs.  Plus you keep almost all of your equipment when.<br/>\n8)  Dungeon crawl mode of adventuring is the standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if these issues are more important to you than having a bank to store<br/>\nstuff, traditional fantasy classes/monsters, secure trading windows, and a<br/>\nbetter chat interface, then you might enjoy AC.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone decides to give it a try, look me up on the Morningthaw server.<br/>\nMy character&#39;s name is Ott Numah.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not quitting EQ (yet) but Asheron&#39;s call is my number 1 game if<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my RL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; friends aren&#39;t logged into EQ.
