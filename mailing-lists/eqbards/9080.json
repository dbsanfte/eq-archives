I wish they would fix this, i really hate zoning in<br/>\nfrom NFreeport to WFreeport (a spot where many guard killers pull to, i<br/>\nam always apprehensive that i will get a bad faction hit just running by<br/>\na battle (as has happenned with GOOD faction MANY times).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is another thing to chew on: when i was 6th level, i was killing<br/>\nspiders on the plateau in NRO. After a bad fight, i ran to the guard<br/>\nnear the plateau, and started my hymn to heal and sat. I got<br/>\n<br/>\nyour wounds begin to heal<br/>\nyour wounds begin to heal<br/>\nyour wounds begin to heal<br/>\n<br/>\n and then i saw &quot;Stop you filty scum&quot; (or some such thing), and THE<br/>\nGUARD attacked and killed me quickly. I scrolled back up to see what i<br/>\nhad done, and i had done NOTHING. I had ok faction with the guards, i<br/>\ndid not have the guard targeted, i was not in combat, and i was singing<br/>\nONLY the hymn.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust something that has botheered me for a while...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 24<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 25 Oct 1999 12:33:57 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Chris&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:spc@...\">spc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: Re: BARD HATE<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I actually think part of &quot;bard hate&quot; comes from a coding error (theory only). If I<br/>\n&gt; am playing heal and a mob runs through our group<br/>\n&gt; getting pulled to another group, I will get all the Faction +/-&#39;s for that mob<br/>\n&gt; being killed. I think this was because in Beta the<br/>\n&gt; bards songs affected everyone (grouped or not) within a certain radius. I think<br/>\n&gt; this area effect code is still in the game but with<br/>\n&gt; an additional check (i.e. in radius + in group) for PC&#39;s but for aggro mobs I<br/>\n&gt; think they effectively get &quot;hit&quot; by our songs (thus we<br/>\n&gt; get those faction hits for mobs we never touched). Thoughts? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
