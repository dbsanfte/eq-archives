Then ALL my songs were resisted, he interrupted all of<br/>\nmy spells, and chained me when I tried to run.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We went back with 5 tanks and this time the thing charmed our lead<br/>\ntank, sang some horrible AE song, and made all the warriors nod off!<br/>\nthen when we thought we had him, he teleported away, with us losing<br/>\nhealth to the AE song the whole time.

When charmed, we Punch, or melee with whatever we have equipped.  I have<br/>\n&gt; not seen or heard of a bard play a single song while charmed.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  the Mail delivery bards just stand there and punch when they are attacked. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
