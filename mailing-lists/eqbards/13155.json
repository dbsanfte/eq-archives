I do appreciate your advice<br/>\non torgors and will inform the shaman/enchanter next time.  <br/>\nIt just didn&#39;t have anything to do with my question - how<br/>\nvalid a tactic is it to devote one tank to the extra giant(s).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   That was my point.
