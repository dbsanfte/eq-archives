I used my mino horn and<br/>\n&gt; targeted the indifferent shopkeeper. Low and behold, he<br/>\n&gt; con&#39;d amiable after the song took affect. Not only did he<br/>\n&gt; con amiable, but so did every other shopkeeper in east<br/>\n&gt; Freeport.The price of the chest plate remained at 794pp<br/>\n&gt; though with my 90 charisma. (I think prices can only go so<br/>\n&gt; low).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup, I&#39;ve pretty much verified this.  I dropped by the gypsies<br/>\nagain and at 110, 115, and 120 charisma, their price for a<br/>\ncombine longsword was always 52.5pp.  The selling price was<br/>\n47.5pp, so that establishes (for gypisies and this item at<br/>\nleast) a base price of 50pp and +/- 5% being the best you can<br/>\ndo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shady swashbuckler is still giving me better prices as I<br/>\nincrease my charisma though.  223pp at 110, 220pp at 115.  I<br/>\njust got back to Freeport last night and need to test it at<br/>\n120.  So there&#39;s definitely some faction/race/diety component<br/>\nto all this.  The charisma song may be worthwhile in this<br/>\nregard (especially since half those damn stuck-up Erudite<br/>\nmerchants won&#39;t sell to me).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; thru Neriak for a half hour. On the other hand (if you<br/>\n&gt; dont have invis yet), use it on a Dark Elf guard and run<br/>\n&gt; thru Nektulos on your way to Lavastorm without them<br/>\n&gt; attacking you. Thats just an example. I&#39;m sure there are<br/>\n&gt; many other uses yet to be discovered. Say you die inside<br/>\n&gt; the house of Unrest and you need to get your corpse.<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps you can target a skel or whatever, use the song on<br/>\n&gt; it and then the entire UnrestInhabitants faction will be<br/>\n&gt; amiable to you for a few minutes? Enough time to /corpse<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps that&#39;s the intended use of the song?  Not getting<br/>\nbetter prices at merchants as previously thought?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; your corpse to safety and wont have to worry about getting<br/>\n&gt; someone to cast invis + invis vs undead on you. Just an<br/>\n&gt; idea, but I havent actually tested these things yet. I<br/>\n&gt; suggest you all experiment with this a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just a safety question - does the NPC ever attack you if the<br/>\nsong somehow fails?  I get nervous targeting songs at NPCs<br/>\nthat are red to me.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
