However,<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have come to the conclusion that the majority of people playing this game<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are not aware of the utility of the /assist command.  I always request<br/>\n&gt;&gt; people in my group to use the /assist command before we start engaging<br/>\n&gt;&gt; enemies.  Almost everytime I do that someone comes back and asks &quot;What is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the /assist command? It isn&#39;t on the Socials menu.&quot;   After I tell them<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it does, generally their next response is &quot;Cool, I didn&#39;t know you could<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The people in my party use /assist all the time, and we&#39;ve found it to be<br/>\nvery<br/>\n&gt;very buggy.  For some reason, /assist will often have them or their pets<br/>\nattack<br/>\n&gt;completely different mobs, and we don&#39;t know why.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Has anyone else had similar experiences?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jyzan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;How many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;More than 5,000!
