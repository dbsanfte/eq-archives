From what I have observed, it seems to work similarly<br/>\n&gt; to our other<br/>\n&gt; songs.  When the effect goes off the mobs get a chance to resist.  If they<br/>\n&gt; fail to resist they nod.  When they would next get to attack they get a<br/>\n&gt; chance to break the nod, if they do they attack.  Just as with some other<br/>\n&gt; songs this results in the effect getting broken before it ever<br/>\n&gt; costs the MOB<br/>\n&gt; anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this conjectured song behavior or a FRPG methodology that we&#39;re assuming<br/>\napplies to EQ?
