One part of this I think is at least on Povar<br/>\n&gt; there really aren&#39;t that many Bards.  Although in someways I think there<br/>\n&gt; may be too many.  What I mean by that is folk using the Bard as their<br/>\n&gt; second char playing it basically as a warrior who runs fast and can heal<br/>\n&gt; fast.  Not mind you that there is anything wrong with this but it does<br/>\n&gt; create stories like the one that follows.  I hope it amuses you all as<br/>\n&gt; much as it did me. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So two nights ago I decided to try and catch up to level 20 I was 19 and<br/>\n&gt; figured HHP would be a good place for this.  So I enter HHP and with<br/>\n&gt; typical humilty but was a bit of florish offer &quot;Bard of the 19th chorus<br/>\n&gt; offers his voice in song to a party in need&quot;  As I arrive at the orc area<br/>\n&gt; I find one of the all too frequent &quot;your a kills stealer no you are a<br/>\n&gt; kills stealer&quot; fights and realized that this was going to be one of those<br/>\n&gt; impossible to group nights.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well not to be discouraged I stick around to see if at the very least I<br/>\n&gt; can impress them with some exploits or tales.  Sure enough a solo wizard<br/>\n&gt; (or very not bright magician) decided to attack an Orc warrior just as a<br/>\n&gt; Medic Spawns next to him.  The poor lad it putting up a great fight (not<br/>\n&gt; getting alot of casts off though) but isn&#39;t doing great with the medic<br/>\n&gt; offering his expert opinion.  Saddly no one else saw fit to help.. I<br/>\n&gt; assume because his death would mean one less turn in the rotation.  So I<br/>\n&gt; grab my lute in hand and decide it&#39;s time to put things to bed.. literally<br/>\n&gt; and sing Lullaby.  This of course knocks the poor medic out until it&#39;s too<br/>\n&gt; late.. and I will not even relate what the warrior was left to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The battle done I congratulate the caster on his good job to which he<br/>\n&gt; replies &quot;it almost wasn&#39;t enough&quot; I comment that I know hence I decided to<br/>\n&gt; help.  His reply which floored me was &quot;I hate to break this to you but you<br/>\n&gt; know you had me targeted so you didn&#39;t help at all&quot; hehehe  When I pointed<br/>\n&gt; out that those orc head nods messages and the fact the medic stopped<br/>\n&gt; casting and pounding on him he was in shock.  &quot;Bards can do that??&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again some folks just have no clue how<br/>\n&gt; much a bard REALLY makes the difference.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Adon Draigcanwyr Povarian Bard Child of the Cathar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS funnish Trivia can anyone come up with the meaning of my last name and<br/>\n&gt; or where it is from?
