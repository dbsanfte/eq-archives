I&#39;ve<br/>\ndone some limited experimenting, mostly on very light greens so that I can<br/>\nget the hang of it, however I&#39;m finding the timing of this song to be<br/>\nsomething I just can&#39;t grasp.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally I select a target, Charm, swtich targets and attack, Selo&#39;s, Hymn,<br/>\nthey back to charm.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I seem to charm too early every single time, the mob breaks<br/>\ncharm and I get beat on for a full cycle while I try to get charm going<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if any of the more experienced bards on the list could offer<br/>\nany tips on timing this so that I can start singing charm as the mob is<br/>\nabout to break out, rather than waiting until I get pounded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that I&#39;ll need to put in a lot of practice and that it will be<br/>\nhard to break the ingrained habit of making sure all my songs overlap. Just<br/>\nfigured I&#39;d appeal to the list before spending 3 hours in teh newbie area<br/>\nperfecting my timing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nThe Tribunal Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
