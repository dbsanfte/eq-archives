I started a bard with 111 agi, 131 with Feet<br/>\nlike a cat :), and I find I dodge more, and get hit for less, but must wear<br/>\nlighter armor.  I also started a gnome cleric with an agility of 101 and 100<br/>\nto test the difference and your ac base goes up at 101, but not at 100 or<br/>\n102.  With an agility of 101 my gnome cleric could solo pawns at level 2<br/>\nwith only a 6 in his 1 handed blunt, because they would rarely hit me, and<br/>\nwith patchwork would often hit me for 1pt.  I had trouble soloing pawns at<br/>\n3rd with the first cleric attempt at 85 agility and 81 strength, because<br/>\nthey would beat the heck out of me long before my increased damage mattered.<br/>\nIt would seem there is a definite tradeoff in agi vs str and Kitasi has<br/>\nlittle trouble soloing blues, unless they are the easy to hit have a lot of<br/>\nhp variety.  I can even solo some whites and have soloed a yellow recently<br/>\nat 15th.  I get swung at a lot, but don&#39;t get hit too often.  When I do it<br/>\noften hurts as my armor is light.  I usually position myself on one side of<br/>\nour targets while the other 3 party members assault from the front.  Usually<br/>\nabout halfway thru a fight they will all turn on me and the whole party gets<br/>\nto swing at their backs.  Its amazing to watch how quickly we slaughter<br/>\ncritters once they turn their backs on a pallie, a ranger, and the cleric.<br/>\nAll to hit that irritating bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Roop Dirump [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 12, 1999 1:32 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] New to the List )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Roop Dirump&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlas, from my rogue friend&#39;s enthusiasm about agility I had hopes that it<br/>\nactually meant something.  I fear strength, indeed, is the only statistic,<br/>\nand the others have little or no impact.  One would hope that if someone<br/>\nactually concentrated on another statistic besides strength they would reap<br/>\nsome reward.  Well, one can only hope that at least for rogues, high agility<br/>\nhelps as she believes.
