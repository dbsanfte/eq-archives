Even us bards need to learn lots of things to understand how to best<br/>\nplay our class.  But right off the bat - you can buff them with chant of<br/>\nbattle and give everyone in the party more ability to attack and kill the<br/>\nmobs you are fighting.  Young level players who are new to the whole thing<br/>\ndo not yet under stand the importance of stats like str, dex, agi.  Even as<br/>\nwe get older - we are constantly trying to balance and improves these stats.<br/>\nYour songs do it magically.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can give the whole party a great DEX boost with Chant of Battle - and if<br/>\nthey think a lev 5 bard is not needed in the melee combat - good then you<br/>\nstand back and use your drum and chant of battle and give them even better<br/>\nbuff.  If there are monks in the group they will be amazed and love you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo off and kill gnolls and stuff and get level 6 for your heal song and then<br/>\nthey will be singing a different tune and you will be playing it &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome again and keep us posted on how you are doing,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 24th song<br/>\nSelling Swords and Such<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tJanko S.
