I&#39;m not a clown; I&#39;m not a textile worker as well as not being a gymnast.  I&#39;m a musician.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The term I like: &quot;Riffing&quot;...  It seems to me - that we are playing five or six seconds of a song - so it would basically just be a riff...  Musically speaking, of course, &quot;riffs&quot; are associated more with instrumental music than vocal music - but I think it fits a hell of a lot better than twisting, juggling, weaving, or heaven-forbid &quot;medlying&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\nLevel 18 Bard<br/>\n&lt;Army of Virtue&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
