So I am wondering if<br/>\n     bronze plate might have the same advantage.  Bronze is only slightly<br/>\n     better then banded ac wise (1 or 2 ac better depending on the piece)<br/>\n     but weights almost twice as much.  Not a very good trade off<br/>\n     considering the weight problem that most of us have.<br/>\n<br/>\n     So, in a nutshell, is Bronze plate worth the extra weight?  Does plate<br/>\n     have an advantage over banded other then the AC increase?<br/>\n<br/>\n     Thanks for you help!<br/>\n<br/>\n     Bujold  17th square<br/>\n     Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n     --------------------------------------------<br/>\n     &quot;Some mornings it just doesn&#39;t seem worth it to gnaw through the<br/>\n     leather straps.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\nShare your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
