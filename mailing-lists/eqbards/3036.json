If you are going<br/>\ndeep into a dungeon you are going to need a well-balanced group.  So your<br/>\nrole becomes a little less pronounced.  You will still be buffing str, agi,<br/>\nattack speed, magic resistance etc.  But for example, in solusek B fighting<br/>\nkobolds, the group starts a fight, i go into melee and start beserker<br/>\ncrescendo and relax =)  It&#39;s actually quite a relief from the many many<br/>\nlevels of 2 and 3 song twisting.  IF a caster comes, the occasion comes to<br/>\ntwist beserker and mystic shielding, not too stressful.  Forget the<br/>\nbellow/anthem type twist, you are not causing significant damage.  I keep<br/>\nbellow memmed for ranged attack and pulling purposes.  A typical fight is<br/>\nbeserker til mob has one-third life then chain.  Nice and easy and a good<br/>\nchange of pace.  I could twist like crazy and make the fight better for all,<br/>\nbut fighting one or two mobs it&#39;s not always necessary.  With 3 or more i<br/>\nwill probably kick in chords of cessation to slow them all down, but<br/>\nbasically the point is you do get to relax at higher levels in big groups<br/>\nunder non-danger fights.  If the fight turns ugly, I will be stacking 3 or 4<br/>\nsongs to be sure.  You&#39;ve got a good group with a lot of diverse abilities,<br/>\nso you can do your best bard thing and not have to worry too much (battle<br/>\nsong during fight, mana song after).  You don&#39;t have to worry about feeling<br/>\na one-hit wonder with the mana song (a high-level bard friend of mine felt<br/>\nthis way), because with you around all your tanks fight a lot better, you<br/>\nresist magic a lot better, you get all your caster&#39;s mana back a lot faster,<br/>\nyou chain those runners, and in danger train-type situations, you can save<br/>\nthe group by fearing, slowing them all down, area effect damage, etc.  But<br/>\non most typical pulls you can relax and give your hand a rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Silverleaf, Level 50 Bard, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\nErisi, Level 7 Paladin, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lora Roa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 3:00 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Twisting<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Lora Roa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Depends on whether you&#39;re talking head/eye work or hand/eye <br/>\n&gt; twitch speed.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got no problem with concentration.  I do have a problem <br/>\n&gt; with having to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;work out my wrists&quot; to learn a repeated pattern.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve found some other classes to require concentration, so far not the<br/>\n&gt; twitchiness of Bards, and yes, with hot keys.  I enjoy having <br/>\n&gt; to think in<br/>\n&gt; battle.  However, a Bard (unlike other casters) has to twitch <br/>\n&gt; to keep up 2<br/>\n&gt; buffs/restores even when resting, and twitches to weave a <br/>\n&gt; buff/Selo when<br/>\n&gt; travelling and twitches insanely if twisting and trying <br/>\n&gt; melee.  So while on<br/>\n&gt; other casters, my fingers fly for short fight, they then get <br/>\n&gt; to rest while<br/>\n&gt; the party rests.  On Bards I&#39;m finding thats not so.  Seems party<br/>\n&gt; expectations and usefulness are determined by the Bard <br/>\n&gt; managing to twist<br/>\n&gt; continously.  Some mid-level Bards feel free to tell me if <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wrong .. but<br/>\n&gt; this is what I&#39;m reading here.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a carpal tunnel &quot;dodger&quot; with the ergonomic keyboard, <br/>\n&gt; trackball mouse<br/>\n&gt; & pad, proper height chair .. etc ... and a diagnosable mild <br/>\n&gt; coordination<br/>\n&gt; problem to boot.  As long as I don&#39;t play &quot;twitch&quot; games <br/>\n&gt; (a.k.a. most 1st<br/>\n&gt; person shooters) I do fine.  I guess I&#39;ve just been a little <br/>\n&gt; surprised by<br/>\n&gt; the Bard&#39;s need to twist constantly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 03:09 PM 7/7/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;At 02:02 PM 7/7/99 -0500, Roop Dirump wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Not only that, I think EVERY class has to do something with <br/>\n&gt; hot keys during<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;a battle!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Comparing to real complications, consider a battle cleric, <br/>\n&gt; such as played<br/>\n&gt; &gt;by a friend of mine and as I&#39;ve tried some myself.
