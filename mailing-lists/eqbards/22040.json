I have just returned to the list and EQ after a 2 <br/>\n&gt; month hiatus. I<br/>\n&gt; have finally hit level 30 with my Bard, Ranian, and I am <br/>\n&gt; looking for places to<br/>\n&gt; hunt now to get through relatively quickly. I am currently <br/>\n&gt; soloing Froon and<br/>\n&gt; Choon, killing bandits for sashes (actually gives a little xp <br/>\n&gt; and reduces<br/>\n&gt; boredom for me) and Ulrich McMannus in WK. I don&#39;t want to do <br/>\n&gt; him to much as my<br/>\n&gt; Barb faction is low as is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What other places can I hunt solo or with a 32 Enchanter for good xp?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I know my equipment is out of date but what would be <br/>\n&gt; suggested that isn&#39;t to<br/>\n&gt; expensive?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Arms: Lambent Vambraces<br/>\n&gt; Back: Cloak of the Icebear<br/>\n&gt; Bracer 1: Lambent Bracer<br/>\n&gt; Bracer 2: Bracer of Scavenging<br/>\n&gt; Chest: Lambent BP<br/>\n&gt; Ears: Opalline Earring (2)<br/>\n&gt; Face: Mask of Deception<br/>\n&gt; Feet: Lambent Boots<br/>\n&gt; Fingers: Jagged Bands (2)<br/>\n&gt; Hands: Iksar Scaled Gloves<br/>\n&gt; Head: Skull Shaped Barbrute<br/>\n&gt; Legs: Lambent Greaves<br/>\n&gt; Neck: Cape of the Midnight Mist<br/>\n&gt; Shoulders: Pegasus Feather Cloak or Bloodstained Mantle<br/>\n&gt; Waist: Troll Hide Belt<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Other: MM Drums, Runed Bone Fork, Gnoll Hide Whip, Blade of <br/>\n&gt; Fiery Lamentations,<br/>\n&gt; Obsidian Shard (2) and Enamelled Black Mace.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for all the help and I enjoy the list a lot.
