You get<br/>\nyour group and go get it (brand new PoF,  Assn room 2 to 6 hour camp, early<br/>\nDragoon Dirk when DVinn dropped one every time, whatever) and you kill the<br/>\nmob and get your loot.  Who is to say that you knew it was a bug?  Aside<br/>\nfrom &#39;duping&#39; items with buggy trade windows or whatever, if the game gives<br/>\nit to you, it should be yours - imho.  If they think something needs to be<br/>\nchanged, I favor the method of not dropping the item any more - ala<br/>\nmanastones. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll this stuff about &#39;class balance&#39; and whether an item is &#39;bugged&#39; (guise<br/>\nlets you get the spell even if you cant wear it - which you need to do to<br/>\nget the stats) is a matter of opinion.  If the game lets you do it - it&#39;s<br/>\nlegal (aside from real cheats like duping).  To make it &#39;illegal&#39; after the<br/>\nfact and magically change the items, will just hurt the players who have<br/>\nthem and not help the ones who don&#39;t. (This is sounding a lot like<br/>\n&#39;twinking&#39; good or bad arguments but let&#39;s not go there ;p)  I don&#39;t think<br/>\nits fair to change stuff because they think it &quot;should be.&quot; It&#39;s like their<br/>\nnerfing of Selo&#39;s and breaking roots - they gave you something and it was<br/>\ngood - but now they think its too good and nerf it. Now it&#39;s getting down to<br/>\na matter of opinion on what is good, too good, or &#39;obvious bug.&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But Sylly, what about all those DE Pallidans and DE Barbarian Shamans???<br/>\nThat is not good Role Play!!&quot;  Ahh, enter the rp police.  BAH!  So what if a<br/>\nPally looks like a DE?  That&#39;s a lot better than the Pally&#39;s who don&#39;t heal<br/>\nothers, who don&#39;t help others, who are just jerks in general.  That&#39;s true<br/>\nbad role play - but nothing can be done to stop that so fussing about some<br/>\ngoofy mask with an illusion spell is hardly going to fix all or even any<br/>\nsignificant amount of bad rp problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 38th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, December 13, 1999 11:23 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Re:Re: Guise of the Deceiver<br/>\n(Longish)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> \t\tOn Mon, 13 Dec 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; decided it was too useful.
