So she would solo a mino lord and then we would kill one.<br/>\nWhile she was soloing hers, I was chaining it to make it a little easier on<br/>\nher while we awaited our turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time, I decided to give her a little extra help in the form of Fulfil&#39;s<br/>\nCurtailing Chant (level 30 song?) which provides the MR debuff along with a<br/>\nsmall DOT (6 or 7 dmg per pulse).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when the mino lord died, imagine my surprise when I got the exp for the<br/>\nkill!!!  She had been dotting the heck out of it as well as bashing it, had<br/>\nher pet helping her, and whatever else a level 36 shaman can do.. hehe, and<br/>\nyet my teensy tiny DOT somehow stole her kill!  Oh, and I wasn&#39;t even<br/>\nequipping a drum (it IS supposed to be a percussion song isn&#39;t it?).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as I see it, there are a few possible explanations.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  She wasn&#39;t getting credit for her pet&#39;s damage.<br/>\n2.  The DOT on Fulfil&#39;s is much higher than suspected.<br/>\n3.  The druid I was with (who was supposedly afk) threw in a few zaps<br/>\n4.  It&#39;s a bug<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of the 32nd Song (yes, I made 32 in, of all places, Kedge!)<br/>\nE&#39;Ci<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
