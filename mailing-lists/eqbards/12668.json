I&#39;ve noticed that since day one.  With eq and<br/>\n&gt;   spell buffs, you can bring your cold resist to the 120&#39;s - 150&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   for Vox.  Someone said that 125 doesn&#39;t have any impact, but 225<br/>\n&gt;   does.  heh.  It&#39;s my opinion, as I have seen with every single other<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   mob in this game that regardless of resistance, you are gonna be<br/>\n&gt;   LoD had one bard (blue to me, poorly equiped) Sagnaria (sp) and<br/>\n&gt;   Weadeneye... that was it.

With a bard song, well, you can do the math.  You&#39;re<br/>\nright, experience with dragons does make a big difference.

Level/experience is clearly better than<br/>\n&gt;   resistances.  Hell, you all were doing dragons without bards at<br/>\n&gt;   one point.  And you still won easily.

If we lose 12 out<br/>\nof 30 people on a Vox raid, to us that was a &quot;hard&quot; Vox run.  For another<br/>\nguild, that may have been &quot;easy&quot;.  Honestly, I think the reason is because<br/>\nof our guilds class makeup.  We have tons of warriors and clerics, and<br/>\nwe&#39;re short on hybrids.  That doesn&#39;t happen very often, as you can see<br/>\nfrom the makeup of most high level guilds.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFor most people though, bard resists will make the difference<br/>\nbetween winning and losing.  I know we&#39;ve definitely cut our losses down<br/>\nwith bards in the primary groups.  I&#39;ve done Vox with only 1 death among<br/>\nall the people who were there (level 40 druid died), and that time we had<br/>\nWeadaneye and Tokisada there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - you&#39;re wrong about our equipment, we trade out everything for resist<br/>\nequipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana\t\t50 Cleric<br/>\nKalera\t\t35 Bard<br/>\nLegions of Darkness<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
