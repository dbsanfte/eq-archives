I need armor/jewelry suggestions that a 46th <br/>\n&gt; mage could acquire with out much help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are a couple of ways you could approach this depending on how <br/>\nsoon you want to start playing your bard again. If you want to get <br/>\nright back to playing him, I would suggest going to Unrest or Sol B <br/>\nand /auctioning that you want to buy bronze armor. Until you get the <br/>\nparts for lambent, bronze is not that bad. (Heck, I bet most of us <br/>\nwere wearing bronze at 30.) The other approach is to spend some time <br/>\nat your local /auction zone (GF on Xegony, EC on many others,) and <br/>\nstart buying lambent.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuick Tip:<br/>\nTake your level 46 magician to the Ocean of Tears (OOT). Get off the <br/>\nboat at the Sister Island (First stop coming from Freeport). The next <br/>\nIsland West (sense heading will say west because the zone is <br/>\nbackwards) is the island on which the Ancient Cyclops spawns, the <br/>\nnext island after that is the island on which the seafury cyclops <br/>\nspawn. Now, you cannot kill a SF at 46 (well, you *might* be able to, <br/>\nbut it would be dangerous and take WAY too much mana,) but you CAN <br/>\nkill Gornit. He is a hill giant that spawns every 6 minute near the <br/>\npirate camp in the SW corner of the island (once again, it is really <br/>\nthe NE corner, but the zone was built with the directions backwards.) <br/>\nGornit is also called the ATM because he drops giant loot. You will <br/>\neventually stop carrying anything but the plat, and will leave there <br/>\nwith quite a bit of money. This is an EASY way to fund your lambent.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for some other suggestions for items:<br/>\n*) 2 x Jagged Band... buy them, they are cheap, and are good items.<br/>\n*) 2 x Opalline (spelled right?) earrings... cheap, buy them.<br/>\n*) Collar of Undead Protection... run to Upper Guk and camp him. <br/>\nHeck, if someone else is camping him for the RBF, they will probably <br/>\ngive you a collar. You can also just buy it for (I would guess) 10-<br/>\n20pp.<br/>\n*) Run your bard to lower guk and wait for a mask to drop. This is <br/>\ntime WELL spent. (Most times you can just /ooc that you are looking, <br/>\nand you will get one.)<br/>\n*) Cazic Thule is not camped like it once was, but the Lizardscale <br/>\nCloak is a good item for a 30 bard.<br/>\n*) I assume you have the expansions... the strawspun belt (while <br/>\ngiving no stats,) gives nice AC and is cheap.<br/>\n*) What did I wear on my shoulders??? I think it was crested <br/>\nspaulders. Anyway, not too expensive, and nice AC.<br/>\n*) If you have the patience, your magician can go to Steamfont and <br/>\ncamp the Hero. I think half-breeds can wear the Hero Bracer, and it <br/>\nis a nice item. You might have to work on your faction, but there are <br/>\nsome quests to take care of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk... that it the stuff off the top of my head. If you have more <br/>\nquestions, please post them. Also, I am sure some of the other bards <br/>\nwill be able to give you much better advice... but this is one Gael&#39;s <br/>\nthoughts. *Smiles*<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne (55 Bard)<br/>\nGaelen (51 Magician)<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
