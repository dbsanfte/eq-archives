A friend from work does it and<br/>\nmakes alot of money doing jewelcraft.  You know what my skill trade would<br/>\nis?  Directions.  I can tell you how to get anywhere in all of Norrath.<br/>\nWithout looking at maps.  Because I like to explore.  As a level 3 barbarian<br/>\n(I know, stupid barbarians!)  I found Permafrost before anyone else even<br/>\nknew about it.  Of course an ice giant killed me on the way out :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo an explorer would be a trade skill, I just can&#39;t make money off of it :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tFriday, July 16, 1999 3:23 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRE: [eqbards] Re: Item Values (meta)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I am the exact opposite.

I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; strong enough to walk thru my own homelands pretty much unmolested - that<br/>\n&gt; was my endgoal on leveling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As tedious as tradeskills are in EQ - I really, really don&#39;t see a problem<br/>\n&gt; with someone willing to devote that much time earning a few plat - since<br/>\n&gt; 99% (soon to be 100% I fear) of them are money loosing propositions, and<br/>\n&gt; most goods aren&#39;t needed by players at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t make you craft - why do some folks think I should HAVE to bash<br/>\n&gt; monsters - or I am &#39;wasting&#39; my time not leveling?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure I WILL level eventually, just in no particular hurry to do so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 01:30 PM 7/16/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Trade skills is what some people want in an MMORPG.

I once modified the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;source of an RPG so I could start off with the best stuff.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;It made the game really boring - the item drops didn&#39;t matter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;because I already had the best stuff, so all that was left was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;endlessly killing monsters for experience.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I think though that if less emphasis were placed on gathering items<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; accumulating wealth in EQ, more emphasis would be put on the social<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; aspect<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of it.  I hate to use UO as an example but in this case it serves as<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; beautiful example.  It just had something EQ missed.  When you died<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think EQ has enough infrastructure to survive on a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; purely social aspect.  There are no player-owned structures,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there are no player-owned merchants, there are no item sinks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and there are very few money sinks (trade skills, steel armor)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; most of which (trade skills) were an afterthought coded in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; just before the game went Final.  In short, there really isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; much you can *do* in EQ which doesn&#39;t revolve around killing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; monsters to gain items and experience.  You can&#39;t really make<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; your mark on the world.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The PvP and Racewar servers definitely have more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; possibilities, but on the normal servers, socializing is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; much different from an IRC chat room.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In that respect, UO is ahead of EQ.  I think EQ only strived<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to make massively multiplayer online hack and slash FRPG.  UO<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; strived to make an online virtual world.  In the discussions<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Brad McQuaid and Raph Koster have had, it&#39;s pretty obvious EQ<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; didn&#39;t have as high a goal as UO.  Brad still refuses to admit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that long-term money and item sinks are necessary in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; persistent online game, to keep player ability inflation (and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thus monster difficulty deflation) in check.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; John H.
