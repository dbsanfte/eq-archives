You read the response we got from him on<br/>\nsom ebard questions - his sig was at the bottom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gargoyles are found in the Ocean of Tears (take the boat from Freeport<br/>\nand it sails through OOT).  I do not have first hand experience with them<br/>\nbut a monk friend had been to visit them and he is about 20ish.  He trained<br/>\nthe giant skels to the Gargs and feigned i guess.  Then let the Garg and<br/>\nSkel duke it out.  Then he recoved and killed the weakened Garg.  Not sure<br/>\nyou could handle them at level 12 - i got the feeling they were higher level<br/>\nbut really dont know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 35th Song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Peck White [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peck_white@...\">peck_white@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 10, 1999 10:47 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Some Questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my original post.  Somehow it didn&#39;t make the trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been lurking on the list and decided it&#39;s time to join in.  Here are a<br/>\ncouple of questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho is GZ?  I&#39;ve seen it mentioned several times in talking about Verant,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s not in the glossary I went to to try and get an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve just gotten my 12th song and have been hunting Dervs in N Ro.  ButI<br/>\nremember reading somewhere about an Island that has Gargoyles that would be<br/>\nappropriate <br/>\nfor someone near my level to hunt.  I remember theposter said that the loot<br/>\nwas worth about a plat each and weighed 0.1lbs.  Does this ring any bells<br/>\nfor <br/>\nanyone?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Derv camps are just too crowded and often with people that think they<br/>\nare super-heros.  I lost my 12th level and had to regain it from just such a<br/>\n<br/>\nperson.  Killed while memming bellow for the first time andthey trained the<br/>\nDervs onto me. (Grrr)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve enjoyed the interaction here and look forward to your<br/>\nresponses.  Thanks in advance and <br/>\n<br/>\nMay your voice always sing true,<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin<br/>\n<br/>\nBard of the 12th Song<br/>\n<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at Yahoo!
