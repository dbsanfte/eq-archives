Here was Gordon&#39;s response.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;ll leave in-depth determination of &quot;role&quot; to those playing it, I<br/>\nthink that you&#39;ve answered your own question here. Bards are good at so many<br/>\nthings, you&#39;re surely here to do some of those things. I feel that Bards<br/>\nexcell at making a good group better. That&#39;s my opinion. What&#39;s more<br/>\nimportant though is, what is a bard&#39;s role to you? If you look at it as a<br/>\nwalking-talking mana battery, there&#39;s not really much I can do to make you<br/>\nfeel better about it. It&#39;s the same issues with the clerics who often<br/>\ncomplain that they are a walking-talking hitpoint-battery. You are a support<br/>\nclass. You support the group, and you do it very well. Whether or not you<br/>\nare happy with that role is up to you. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Gordon <br/>\n<br/>\nPretty pathetic in my opinion.  Obviously Gordon just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>\nThere&#39;s a huge difference between the satisfaction one gets from saving a<br/>\ncomrade&#39;s life (virtual or not) and the satisfaction of knowing that the<br/>\ndruid can get off one more Careless Lightning because you stood around and<br/>\nplayed mana battery.  What a joke.  Obviously in VI&#39;s &quot;Vision&quot; bards are not<br/>\nmeant to be real characters.  Our role is solely to support other&#39;s efforts.<br/>\nThey should have called the class &quot;Sidekick&quot; instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
