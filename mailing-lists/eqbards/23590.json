First, I won a Selos Drum off Naggy.  Second, I was 49th<br/>\nlevel and wanted to ding 50 ASAP.  Third, the changes to the EXP system.  So<br/>\nI went do Dreadlands and tried chant kiting for the first time.  Getting<br/>\nfrom 49 to 50 was the easiest and fastest I have ever made a level (aside<br/>\nfrom newbie levels).  I didn&#39;t actually time it, but I would guess it only<br/>\ntook me five hours to ding 50.  The only downtime I had was when I had to<br/>\nstop pulling and get another SOW buff.  What little damage I took from a mob<br/>\nwas healed back while I was looking for another mob to pull.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnly problem with chant kiting I have is that it is boring as hell and not<br/>\nreally a challenge.  As soon as I got 50, I headed back into Karnors.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nintend to ever do it again unless I can&#39;t find a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci    <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 26, 2001 10:40 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Soloing bards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve  rarely solo&#39;d since level 5 or 6, apart from the occasional experiment<br/>\non a low blue or green, I&#39;m just not all that good at soloing and don&#39;t<br/>\nreally care for the tactics bards need to employ to be successful at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
