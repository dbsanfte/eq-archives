If this is indeed a &quot;Desperate<br/>\n&gt;Dirge&quot;, that can only be used<br/>\n&gt;once every 40 minutes (the longest timer of any effect in the game, if I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;not mistaken), it should, in at<br/>\n&gt;least some small number of expected circumstances, have a significant<br/>\n&gt;effect.  It doesn&#39;t.  By the time<br/>\n&gt;you get it, the amount of damage it does is inconsequential to the eventual<br/>\n&gt;outcome of any fight, and is<br/>\n&gt;actually much more likely to be detrimental due to the AE component (which<br/>\n&gt;wakes up anything mezzed)<br/>\n&gt;coupled with the ludicrous resists (which wakes up anything mezzed,<br/>\n&gt;frequently without damaging them in<br/>\n&gt;the slightest).  And the level increases that Verant gave to this song are<br/>\n&gt;laughably small compared to the<br/>\n&gt;increased HP total of higher-level MOBs.  They really have no clue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am inconvenienced only in that we were theoretically limited to one<br/>\n </span></blockquote>song<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; per level and I don&#39;t get one at that level due to 7% of the people.
