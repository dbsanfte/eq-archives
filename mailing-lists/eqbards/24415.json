Once you get good, the mob will be doing 90% of its damage on the<br/>\nparty&#39;s main target, 10% on you.  Thats a great tradeoff to 0-10% damage<br/>\ndone to chanter/healer and mana spent mezzing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my &quot;pet assist&quot; hotkey, it works great.  Rule 1, let the group know<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re doing, and make sure its ok with the enchanter.  Most are happy<br/>\nfor the mana you save them.  Type A enchanters will not be happy, so then<br/>\njust let them mez the mob...<br/>\n<br/>\nOk 2 Pull comes, assist the puller and find out what mob he is killing.<br/>\nTarget the non targeted mob and hit charm, once it sticks (very low resists<br/>\nif you have a good CHA) hit the &quot;pet assist&quot; hotkey.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you get this down its easy to weave 2 other songs while doing this...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Pet Assist&quot;<br/>\n/pet back off<br/>\n/assist &lt;main assist name&gt;<br/>\n/pause 3<br/>\n/pet attack<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pet back off is not necesaary, but seems to help.  Sometimes charms mobs<br/>\nwill still attack other party members or pets, the pet back off will prevent<br/>\nthis.  It also lets the party know what you have charmed, since your pet<br/>\nwill say something.  THe down side is the second or so of melee you lose<br/>\nfrom your pet while he is waiting for the attack command.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side not, /pet back off, is probably the best mem blur spell in the<br/>\ngame.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
