I&#39;ve lost count on<br/>\nthe number of times when channeling through a gate has allowed me to live<br/>\nwhere if it were a melee class in my place they would have died.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all depends on where you level.  One of my guildmates recently posted<br/>\non another forum something that I think applies.  I&#39;ll paraphrase and sum<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBasically for every set of levels there is an &quot;easy&quot; place and a<br/>\n&quot;difficult&quot; place to level.  Easy places are either outdoor zones, or<br/>\ndungeons where everything is near the zone line.  Cazic and Solusek <br/>\nB are &quot;easy places&quot;.  Najena, Upper Guk, and Lower Guk are not.<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I spend levels 35 to 50 in Solusek B, I can probably count the number<br/>\nof times on one hand where gate has made a difference.  If I spend them in<br/>\nLower Guk, that would not be the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; question specializes in alteration their chance to get a gate off with<br/>\n&gt; multiple mobs beating on them when things go bad is about nil. And<br/>\n&gt; casters that gate out at the first sign of trouble don&#39;t get invited<br/>\n&gt; back into groups very often.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tActually, mana cost and fizzle percentage are the only 2 things<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard confirmed as to what specializations affect, but that&#39;s totally<br/>\nbesides the point here.  I&#39;m a cleric specializing in Alteration.  I<br/>\nchannel through my evocation spells still close to 90% of the time<br/>\n(although retribution is a bit lower since it&#39;s a lvl 49 spell).  Now,<br/>\ngranted, my channeling has now capped at 240, but I&#39;ve been greater than<br/>\n50% since around lvl 30 or so, and when I was level 30, spec&#39;s haven&#39;t<br/>\neven been implemented yet.  So no, it&#39;s not gauranteed that you&#39;ll get<br/>\nyour gate off, but channeling through a lvl 5 spell at level 30 is simple,<br/>\nand it&#39;s CERTAINLY not &quot;nil&quot; as you suggest.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana Windryder<br/>\nLvl 50 Cleric<br/>\nLvl 14 Bard<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
