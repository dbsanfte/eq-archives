Well earned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; p.s. LoD spanked Naggy - SOL-B is horrible with 70 plus in the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Spanked?  Try they had many casualities, and almost lost.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; p.s.s. ML and Storm got spanked by Voxxy and yielded the camp to LoD by<br/>\n&gt;&gt; prior agreement on a certain time.  LoD prolly got Voxxy and Naggy in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; same night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  What the f*ck?  Were you there?  Hell no you werent.  You have no<br/>\n&gt;  clue as to what happened.  We didn&#39;t get spanked at all.  I&#39;ll share<br/>\n&gt;  with you what happened Ms. Naive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  LoD (ala FoH) does everything, they just dropped Nagafen, and threatened<br/>\n&gt;  to come take Vox next.  The Vox teams rushed around trying to do it all<br/>\n&gt;  before LoD showed up and the was the first major problem.  Then some<br/>\n&gt;  shaman pets got lose after pulling monk FD, and inadvertantly pulled<br/>\n&gt;  Vox right into the King Room.  People paniced, and ran around, and then<br/>\n&gt;  chaos ensued.  It really pisses me off that those mistakes were made,<br/>\n&gt;  but it even pisses me off more that you think we got spanked.  We didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  even fight Vox.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Irritated,<br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;========================================================================<br/>\n&gt;To UNSUBSCRIBE from this community, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;and reply to the confirmation email we send you.<br/>\n&gt;========================================================================<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
