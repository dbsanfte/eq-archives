Information on these is widely held, so I won&#39;t<br/>\ngo into detail here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFirst, let me say I measure the damage value of a weapon using a stat<br/>\ncalled damage per second (dps). This is calculated assuming that the delay<br/>\nis in tenths of a sec (I think that&#39;s about right). To calculate: ( (damage<br/>\n* 2) + 1 ) / (delay / 10)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPlease give me any info you have on any of these weapons, including<br/>\nopinons on which is best, how hard they to obtain, how much they sell for<br/>\nif sold, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAlso, if there are any missng from this list please add them. (There are<br/>\nonly 4 here). And two of those are not even confirmed as 1H slashing magic<br/>\nweapons.  If they are not magic and 1H slashing then I am very much hoping<br/>\nI am missing some good ones from this list. <br/>\n<br/>\nBarbed Whip<br/>\nDamage 7 / Delay 28 = 5.35 dps<br/>\nFound on the Bonrcrusher in Najena<br/>\n<br/>\nPolished Granite Tomahawk<br/>\nDamage 6 / Delay 26 = 5 dps<br/>\nCasts berserker strnegth occasionally, but I don&#39;t know what this is.<br/>\nHave no idea where it is found.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystalline Sword<br/>\nDamage 11 / Delay 38 = 6.05 dps<br/>\nDon&#39;t even know if this is magical, but I have a feeling it is<br/>\nDon&#39;t have any idea where to find it<br/>\nDon&#39;t even know if it is 1H Slashing<br/>\nPlease help on this one, I like the stats!<br/>\n<br/>\nCerrated Bone Dirk<br/>\nDamage 9 / Delay Delay 26 = 7.3 dps!<br/>\nDon&#39;t know if it is 1H slashing<br/>\nDon&#39;t know if it magic<br/>\nI do know it is found on the Froglock Assasin in Guk Bottom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for comparison:<br/>\n<br/>\nMino Axe<br/>\nDamage 8 / Delay 37 = 4.59 dps<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarven Axe<br/>\nDamage 6 / Delay 26 = 5 dps</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
