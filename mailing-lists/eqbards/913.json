Now that I am <br/>\nsettled with moving and all and getting EQ ready, can anyone (especially <br/>\nthose that have played on more than one server) give me any suggestions as <br/>\nto what the best servers are to play on?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group that I was always with in P4 is on Veeshan, and they are right <br/>\nabout to hit 50th level (all of them!)...and, well - they are pure <br/>\npowergamers. I was wanting to join them, but there is no way I could keep up <br/>\nwith them. Actually, I&#39;m thinking of taking it easy. I did all the <br/>\npowergaming I need during beta. I would like to seriously get into the RP <br/>\naspect of the game (or help to foster it).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was on Fennin Ro at that time, and that server was a nightmare. I guess <br/>\nit&#39;s ok now? I heard that during beginning of commercial Fennin was even <br/>\nmore crowded than before. Any info on this will be much appreciated! <br/>\nEspecially if there are any particular servers I should stay away from. I am <br/>\nthinking getting on the newest server would be ideal, though I don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhich one is newest.
