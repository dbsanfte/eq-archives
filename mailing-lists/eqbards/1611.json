Upon getting back","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2026296443\">There seems to be spots in zones that you can&#39;t get to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was destroyed by a train in CB once, about 10 half elven feet from the<br/>\nexit... Upon getting back inside and playing the locating corpse song, I<br/>\nkept being pointed into a wall ..... Anywhere I stood, it was the same<br/>\nwall... Behind which I could not get to... After petitioning, the guide<br/>\nteleported me BEHIND the spot where you zone from CB back into Greater<br/>\nFaydark...  There was a bend (which you can see, just not get to from CB)<br/>\nand voila, there was my corpse.  When I walked back towards the zone spot, I<br/>\nzoned into Greater Faydark, even tho I was coming from the other<br/>\ndirection... seems the map continues and they put an &quot;boundry&quot; in the middle<br/>\nthat makes you change zones.  Makes sense since this would make walking<br/>\ntowards that boundry more realistic.  (seeing it continue) I know I&#39;ve been<br/>\ncaught offguard by the zone when approaching the zone boundry, east to west<br/>\ncommandlands comes to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis body could have been in the zone, just on the other side of the zone<br/>\nboundry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you petition they should help you get your body.... And if you let them<br/>\nknow that you were trying to help this other guy and got caught in the wall,<br/>\nthey might even reimburse you your lost exp.  They&#39;ve said they&#39;d do this if<br/>\nyou died to a bug.  (getting them to do this might be another story.)  : P<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 07, 1999 7:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Galtin&#39;s misadventure + some questions about corpse s<br/>\nin the ocean<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s corpse?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; In my experience if you target a player with no corpse in the zone, you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; get the same message saying that you sense a corpse in this direction,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but it does not actually turn you in any direction. Maybe you were<br/>\n&gt;&gt; already pointing in that direction, and just though it was pulling you?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In this particular case, I was facing inward on the dock when I<br/>\n&gt;started the song.
