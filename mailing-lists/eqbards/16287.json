I have grouped with skilled druids<br/>\nquite often.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, it is that versatility that gets the bad (or uneducated, agressively<br/>\nstupid...etc) *player* in trouble.  Just because a Druid has nukes, does not<br/>\nmake him a nuker.  Just because they have TPorts, does not make them a taxi. <br/>\nBut, a druid should be able to recognize just from group makeup what role<br/>\nhe/she is supposed to fill.  similar to bards in that respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nbasically, noone ever says &quot;let&#39;s add that [shaman, druid, bard, cleric,<br/>\nenchanter, ranger] to our group because we need a nuker.&quot;  None of those<br/>\nclasses are &quot;nukers&quot; but they all have DD spells/songs.  (same with necros,<br/>\nmages)  Wizards are the only class in the game that you want &quot;for their<br/>\nnukes&quot;...every other class has abilities that are a more efficient use of<br/>\n*their* time, mana etc.<br/>\n<br/>\njust to make sure that i sound totally like a broken record, i would take any<br/>\nclass played by a good player over a more appropriate class with a bad, or even<br/>\njust an unfamiliar [to me] player.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid<br/>\n23rd song Half Elf Bard<br/>\nGlyphed Aegiss<br/>\n27th lvl Dark Elf Magician<br/>\n&lt;wave of the dark tide&gt;<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
