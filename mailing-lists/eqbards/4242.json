Sometimes the mob you charm will<br/>\nattack a player (a party member in all cases so far) and will<br/>\nnot stop despite repeated commands to sit down, follow me, or<br/>\nattack another mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t been able to reproduce this at will, but I *think*<br/>\nthis happens when I charm a mob, order it to attack another<br/>\nmob, it becomes uncharmed, a party member attacks it, and I<br/>\nre-charm it.  I know it&#39;s not the command failing because the<br/>\ncharmed mob says the appropriate things but keeps right on<br/>\nattacking.  Does anyone know what&#39;s up with this?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were almost killed by a cyclops last night because a stupid<br/>\nkodiak tagged along and I wasted time trying to charm it to<br/>\ntake it out of the fight and it kept right on attacking.  <br/>\n(OTOH my ranger friend was absolutely ecstatic when the<br/>\ncyclops frenzied on him, got him down to one bubble as the<br/>\ncleric went OOM, and I charmed the cyclops to pull it off<br/>\nhim.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
