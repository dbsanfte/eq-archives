We are the best and most friendly class in<br/>\nthe game (don&#39;t tell anyone).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AC benefit of bronze over banded was never justifiable to me considering<br/>\nthe weight, so I was in banded until I bought steel one piece at a time.<br/>\nFrom steel I started accumulating the Lambent pieces, a full set of which is<br/>\nvery well rounded stat-wise.  Stay with your bronze if you&#39;re happy until<br/>\nyou start getting Lambent.  Since you have the bronze you might as well skip<br/>\nover Steel as it&#39;s quite expensive (Breastplate was ~850pp as I recall).<br/>\nHowever, the one saving grace of buying steel is that you basically rent it.<br/>\nThe sell-back price of steel plate is quite high (75%?), so much of your<br/>\ninvestment is recouped as you replace those pieces with Lambent.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor weapons I would recommend a Polished Granite Tomahawk or Barbed Leather<br/>\nWhip in your primary hand and Dragoon Dirk in your offhand (when you hit 17<br/>\nand get duel wield that is).  The benefit of these two weapons is that they<br/>\nwork on two separate skills (1 hand slash and piercing) simultaneously as<br/>\nyou level.  When you can afford it buy a Staff of Writhing (~400pp), bite<br/>\nthe bullet and work your 1 hand blunt skill up.  As you mature and replace<br/>\nthe Dragoon Dirk with a better weapon (although it&#39;s awfully good for the<br/>\nlevel that it&#39;s available - you&#39;ll use it a while), you can move it to your<br/>\nrange (throwing) slot and retain its stat bonuses.  So the Dirk remains<br/>\nuseful even after you stop wielding it in your hand and thus amortizes your<br/>\nexpenditure even further over time.<br/>\n<br/>\n[47 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Sigma111&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sigma7@...\">sigma7@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; I just subscribed to this list, but I was wondering if any of you<br/>\n&gt; could reccomend a 1h slash weapon for a level 12 bard?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, I am in bronze armor now for the most part..and it seems a bit<br/>\n&gt; heavy.
