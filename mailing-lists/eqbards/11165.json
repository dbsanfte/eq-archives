This was done to <br/>\nprevent a certain<br/>\nabuses of the spell which involved chain casting levitate to reach areas <br/>\nwhich were not<br/>\ndesigned to be player accessible.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get your levitation spell renewed, you can click to dispel it (this is <br/>\none of the<br/>\nfew spells that everybody can click to remove). Once the spell has been <br/>\nremoved, you will<br/>\nbe able to have it renewed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards were unintentionally hurt with these changes - their song will not <br/>\noverwrite its<br/>\nown levitate effect. This error will be fixed with the next patch. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
