My friends always enjoyed it<br/>\nthough, when they were out of food and I handed them a few beer braised<br/>\nsteaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot too long ago someone posted an article on EQVault explaining how<br/>\nfood/water consumption works in detail. It had nothing to do with the type<br/>\nof food.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully in the future Verant will make different types of food be worth<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, if you want to save money, stick to muffins and milk.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
