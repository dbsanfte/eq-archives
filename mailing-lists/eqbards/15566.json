We decided to stay and fight<br/>\nto see how far we could get and towards the end when we were all down to two<br/>\nbubs of health, I switched to healing with the lute and Anthem... I was<br/>\nTOTALLY impressed.  Not only did i keep everyone alive but we finished with<br/>\nabout half health!  It was great!  I love my bard!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 01, 2000 9:07 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Questions...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings!<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the wonderful world of groups!  &quot;So, who&#39;s twink are you?&quot; Hehe,<br/>\nat least it&#39;s a bit better these days because there is the very real chance<br/>\nthat you will be fighting with someone who really does have a level 50 char<br/>\nand maybe they have some clue as to how to work in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeed, AC, HP, & resists are things that really matter.  Look at your song<br/>\nlist and see what you have to raise these for your party and lower them for<br/>\nyour enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt kind of depends on what other classes are in your party to define what<br/>\nrole you should fill.  Bards are versatile so you can kind of fill in the<br/>\nblanks.  If you are tank heavy but healer light, you can use lute and hymn.<br/>\nIf you have healers and are tank light, I&#39;d go so far as to say use<br/>\nwhistling war song to maximize your damage output - its 20% attack speed<br/>\nincrease is significant if you have good weps.  You have claws and they are<br/>\nvery fast weapons.  As long as your healer can keep you alive - maximize<br/>\nyour damage output. If you have other tank type, you may settle for Anthem.<br/>\nIf you go against casters, be sure to use elemental rhythms or the<br/>\nappropriate resist song.  Note that they add AC so they are good to twist in<br/>\nvs. melee class mobs too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 01, 2000 9:30 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Questions...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, I really have been reading these posts and I&#39;m sure these questions<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; been answered but...........<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just starting to group up with more than two people with my Bard.<br/>\nWhat<br/>\n&gt; songs are the best to do?  I&#39;ve been using buff song plus hymn for the<br/>\nmost<br/>\n&gt; part....and do most people use their weapons or instruments at my level<br/>\n&gt; (20)... I do have a claw and a harpoon from Kedge so I do quite a bit of<br/>\n&gt; damage if I&#39;m fighting...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tani 20th Bard (leveled last night!)<br/>\n&gt; Halana 50th Shaman<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
