He also hinted<br/>\nthat this was &#39;optimal&#39; for running the Kunark expansion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest dumping a couple of hundred dollars in RAM before upgrading<br/>\njust about anything else.  (I build these things for a living...more RAM<br/>\nalways helps the equations)<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: Windows 95/98 does not use RAM effectively above 128MB.  If you do a<br/>\nperformance analysis, there is a large dropoff at the 128MB mark.  Win2K (I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t done an analysis yet, so this is hearsay) should be able to use up<br/>\nto 1 GB of RAM effectively, assuming your processor/bios/motherboard is up<br/>\nto the task.  Incidentally, I don&#39;t use anything but Intel chips in<br/>\nmachines, because every AMD I&#39;ve tested has problems of one sort or another,<br/>\nand I stress the dog out of every processor I own.  I don&#39;t believe the AMD<br/>\nchips are bad, but the motherboard chipset support seems lacking.  This is<br/>\nprobably changing as we speak, as AMD needs to be a bit more stable than<br/>\nIntel, since they are selling alot of chips to the &#39;I&#39;ve never used one of<br/>\nthese things before...&#39; market.  I&#39;ll continue to test AMD chipsets in the<br/>\nnear future, and maybe I&#39;ll be happy with stability soon...maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\n23rd Song Bard<br/>\nSolusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kevin L.
