The inability to bind near the zone you are hunting makes<br/>\nadventuring very difficult.  Now the inn idea is better, but some zones<br/>\nhave no inns between you and the nearest city zone.  The next thing is<br/>\nthere seems to be no way to consider a part of zone as a place to bind. Or<br/>\nelse the area around Kelethin would have been binding spot instead of the<br/>\nwhole G Fay zone.  You&#39;ll notice that places where you can bind<br/>\nnon-casters are strictly city zones or else the zone allows you to bind<br/>\nala G Fay.  So, for the sake of roleplaying this is a cool idea, but it<br/>\nwill not improve our situation in EQ much.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin - Bard of Kelethin - Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 9 Jun 1999, Brandon Kassebaum wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Brandon Kassebaum &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kassebaum@...\">kassebaum@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; this idea was potsed to the message board that fostered the birth of the<br/>\n&gt; bardic petition.<br/>\n&gt; why not allow bards to bind, but restrict it to themselves in taverns or<br/>\n&gt; inns.

It still maintains the necessity for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non-casters to be bound by casters and allows for some flexibility for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non-casters.  I personally hate dying defending a caster only to run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; through 5 or 6 zones to retrieve my corpse.
