Maybe I&#39;m incorrect in assuming<br/>\n&gt; that the whole point of EverQuest is the experience of getting to level 50.<br/>\n&gt;  There may be a few challenges left at level 50, but that&#39;s not really what<br/>\n&gt; the game is all about.  Once you reach 50, I don&#39;t really see the point.<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;ve won, essentially.  You&#39;ve become a demi-god, or whatever. If it was<br/>\n&gt; a single player game, it would be over.  Why should Verant have to generate<br/>\n&gt; content for those that have maximized their characters, beyond the few<br/>\n&gt; really tough encounters that should be the ultimate victories for said<br/>\n&gt; characters?  Once you&#39;ve killed Nafagen, or Lady Vox, or other Uber-mob,<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t it be time to retire?  Obviously this stance would cause the<br/>\n&gt; level 50 people to stop playing, and move on to other games, but I think<br/>\n&gt; that this is how it should be (unless they want to play as a different<br/>\n&gt; character). <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I guess as other games, like the Realm, and even UO were able to<br/>\nkeep people amused for years even after they had maxed out their<br/>\ncharacters, most of us had an expectation that EQ would be the same.<br/>\nOnline games are _not_ single player games. If they expect to keep a<br/>\nuser base they have to provide something to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n The VAST majority of players still haven&#39;t reached 50, and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; most aren&#39;t even close.  Verant can&#39;t make the game revolve around<br/>\n&gt; powergamers, because they would never be able to keep up.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you are very wrong here. One the older servers, the vast<br/>\nmajority of players are well over L30 now, or at least on Tarrew Marr<br/>\nwhere I play that is the case. And a large majority of the players on<br/>\nthe server under L30 are second characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In fact, I&#39;m for<br/>\n&gt; putting level 50 characters into forced retirement until the expansion<br/>\n&gt; pack.  That way we could get rid of all this farming for guilds, and for<br/>\n&gt; other twinked characters.  Plus we&#39;d stop distracting the developers from<br/>\n&gt; fixing the real problems with the game.  In my opinion, lack of things for<br/>\n&gt; level 50 players to do is not an important problem in the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you think pushing L50&#39;s out of the game would stop farming for guilds<br/>\nyou are dreaming. It was happening long before there were any L50&#39;s on<br/>\nour server. I think it started happening the first week they created<br/>\nguilds at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
