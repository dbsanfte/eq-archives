Some times I have<br/>\nlots of success (once held a frog shaman and an icebone for 30s while<br/>\nmy root wore off) and sometimes I have 75%+ resist rates.  I was chain<br/>\nstriking last night to augment a 2 paladin 1 cleric stun session to<br/>\nkeep cenobites from healing.  I got so many resists that, had it not<br/>\nbeen for the cenos, I&#39;d remove it from my list.
