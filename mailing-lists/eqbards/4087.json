On the short spear, it lasts about 10 seconds.<br/>\nThe ashenwood short spear is a nice weapon on it&#39;s own, but the effect<br/>\non it is really disappointing. For one thing, it won&#39;t go off while<br/>\nplaying a bard song, as it has to be manually set off by right clicking,<br/>\nrather than procing like most weapons. (note the Guise of the Deciever&#39;s<br/>\nDark Elf illusion won&#39;t activate while you are playing a song either,<br/>\nand when the effect on that wears off it locks up your songs just like<br/>\nprocing weapons used to) Also, the spear only has 10 haste charges on it<br/>\nand it cannot be recharged.  I dont see why the haste effect isn&#39;t a<br/>\nproc like it is on the executioner&#39;s axe. I can&#39;t see it being that<br/>\npowerful a weapon with that addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginally I have heard, this weapon was intended to be automaticly<br/>\nrecharged of a depleted single charge once per everquest day. I also<br/>\nheard the same about the formerly buggy spring and harvest crystals. My<br/>\nguess is that they couldnt get the code to do this daily recharge<br/>\nworking so they changed everything that formerly depended on the code<br/>\nto be 10 charges and the spear just got caught in the change without<br/>\nanyone really thinking about the implications.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
