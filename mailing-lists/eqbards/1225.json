Equestrielle,<br/>\nI gather (from the times I&#39;ve followed the unicorn) is just a wandering,<br/>\nnon-aggro high-level critter.  Crookstinger is rumoured to carry a magical<br/>\nweapon - which is why it was being hunted, I&#39;m sure.  I&#39;d never heard of it<br/>\nspawning before, so I assume that either 1) it&#39;s rare, or 2) it&#39;s been<br/>\nreimplemented.<br/>\nNo clue about the fairie, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
