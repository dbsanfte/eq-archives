As mentioned in  previous reply, we<br/>\n&gt; bards are actually very good soloists.  When things get hairy, we have the<br/>\n&gt; accellerando  - a near full-proff excape route.  In the situation you<br/>\n&gt; described, if I was getting hit hard and hit a lot, I&#39;d hit accellerando<br/>\nat<br/>\n<br/>\nI lasted about 15 seconds.  I tried my damndest to get accell - but kept on<br/>\ngetting stunned...<br/>\nWhile I was stunned the two cents and the legionaire were hitting me..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; about 3 bars of health.  This is because you slow down below 2 bars and<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; may need that extra bar to get some distance between you and the orcs.<br/>\n&gt; Always have accellerando hot-keyed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStupid me - didn&#39;t know you can hot-key a spell...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Second, lament is a great spell but it can, as you have learned, fail.<br/>\n&gt; However, the lower the level of creature is compared to you, the more<br/>\nlikely<br/>\n&gt; it is to succeed.  Never use it on a white or higher con.  It will fail<br/>\nway<br/>\n&gt; too often.  But, if they all con green or a low blue, you could solo a<br/>\ncamp<br/>\n&gt; and clean it out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t realize they &quot;fixed&quot; that spell.  When I first got it - it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nworking.  Was soloing an orc camp in Lesser Feydark - (with a bunch of high<br/>\nlevel guys - no prob that time) - and it didn&#39;t work.  I recall comments on<br/>\nthis list about it.  If there were comments that it was fixed - I must have<br/>\nmissed it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Third, our greatest power is in grouping, but grouping is risky.  It is a<br/>\n&gt; high-trust situation.  Be very careful who you group with and guage how<br/>\nwell<br/>\n&gt; you can trust them.  I might group with a group like you had described,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; I would not trust them to save my butt if I got in trouble and at the<br/>\nfirst<br/>\n&gt; sign of trouble, I&#39;d run.  Only when they have shown that they can be<br/>\n&gt; counted on to keep me alive when the going got rough would I let myself<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; low in health.  I die more frequently in a group then solo because I am<br/>\n&gt; still too trusting and eager to jump into danger to save someone whose<br/>\n&gt; stupidity got them into trouble... usually failing and dieing along side<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell the biggest thing I learned - not to listen to non-bards about what<br/>\nsong to use.  The leader of the group (who seemed to know what he was<br/>\ndoing) - asked me to turn on the dischord song before starting to fight.  I<br/>\nshould have trusted my own instincts than listen to someone else...  I<br/>\nusually start with a buff song - and switch when I feel it&#39;s appropriate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Be up front with them about this though.  Make sure they understand that<br/>\n&gt; since you don&#39;t know them well, and your life is dear to you, you will do<br/>\n&gt; what you have to to protect it until some trust and teamwork has<br/>\ndeveloped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate the advice.  Live and learn (or in this case - Die and Learn!)<br/>\nGetting Stunned is clearly the biggest problem we face in combat!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
