I have done a lot (really a whole lot) with events in That Other Game<br/>\n(tm) and in order to succeed events have to work /with/ the chaos of online<br/>\npopulations rather than against them.  Giving out large amounts of<br/>\ninformation in game is a Bad Idea, particularly in EQ with it&#39;s textbox<br/>\nformat. If anyone were to ask /me/ how to do it to maximize everyones fun<br/>\n(*grin* not that anyone would, unless maybe they knew about the Napa/GL/SP<br/>\nTengu and didn&#39;t hate him) they would have all the backstory and buildup<br/>\noccur on webpages with message boards for those interested and only have a<br/>\nfew key events play out in-game. GMs should be able (and have full<br/>\nauthority) to temporarily mute anyone (while the offender is in the zone and<br/>\nonly for the duration of the event) and &quot;players&quot; in the story should get a<br/>\ndifferent color text.<br/>\nSince they are not going to want to run the event simultaniously on all<br/>\nservers there could be a quest set up for those who want the event to happen<br/>\non their server, complete the quest and get one more vote for your server to<br/>\nhave the event. That way you could also generally limit it to folks of the<br/>\nright level for the quest.<br/>\nAt any rate, it&#39;s not a perfect system by a long shot, just an idea, but I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s better than &quot;GM shows up/kills a bunch of people/spams<br/>\ncontent/deals with jerks/treasure hunt for quest item&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz/Tengu</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
