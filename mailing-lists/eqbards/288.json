I can only read the words that you<br/>\npost, I can not try to determine what you actually meant by them.  Your<br/>\nexplanation about not wanting to get petty and point fingers sounds very<br/>\nreasonable and I accept it as your true meaning.  Please also understand the<br/>\nfeeling I and others have had about the original post.  We only can see<br/>\nwhat&#39;s there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;First, let me apologize for a poorly worded sentence. I said:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t care to try and correct some of these things - I just ask that,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; going forward, people be more cautious about the things they declare as<br/>\n&gt;&gt; truth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In my attempt to be brief, I realize I sounded like I was saying I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;WANT to correct things. What I meant to imply is that I don&#39;t want to get<br/>\n&gt;petty and point fingers at people after the fact.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No, I don&#39;t have all the answers, and never said as much. I invite<br/>\n&gt;speculation so long as it&#39;s colored that way, and not masked as truth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s disappointing to have been mischaracterized and slandered by people<br/>\n </span></blockquote>who<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;don&#39;t know me. And worse yet, I&#39;m exposed to several instances of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hipocrasy,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;launching untruthful attacks at the Soerbaird.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Being told not to promote our guild in this forum, and then seeing people<br/>\n&gt;recruit forum members for a newly forming guild. So long as we&#39;re publicly<br/>\n&gt;slandered, you can expect us to try and give an explanation or correction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Someone said they want a better guild guild than ours that helps people,<br/>\n&gt;travels and adventures. Too bad this person has never been to our web site<br/>\n&gt;and read about us. Instead, they choose to slander us. I would love to meet<br/>\n&gt;you and show you all we hold dear. You&#39;d find that not only do we fit what<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re describing, but we also are encouraging each other as we write<br/>\n&gt;ballads and history about Norrath and it&#39;s inhabitants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would boldly say that the Soerbaird value truth. I stand by my previous<br/>\n&gt;implications that spreading false information is dishonorable and selfish.<br/>\n&gt;We do expect people to speak intelligently. If this is to be seen as<br/>\n&gt;arrogant, then so be it. But I ask you - if your life depended on it, would<br/>\n&gt;you rather ask someone who told you, &quot;I&#39;m not sure, but I think it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt;second right in Highpass&quot; or, &quot;Just take the second right in Highpass and<br/>\n&gt;run for the exit&quot; - without knowing if this were true.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have met many young ones running quests for hours that weren&#39;t right, but<br/>\n&gt;adamantly defended by the unknowing. It&#39;s this thing I hope to see<br/>\n </span></blockquote>squashed.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;We have high expectations of each other. Jythri has posted to that effect.<br/>\n&gt;And some members, probably as one might suspect, have been reprimanded for<br/>\n&gt;not upholding high standards. But I also tell you that many of us have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>given<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the weapon in our hand, and the shirt off our back to help people in need.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;have personally fallen in combat dozens of times helping someone get their<br/>\n&gt;belongings back from fatal places.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It deeply hurts to be called arrogant, snobbish, ego-centric, and someone<br/>\n&gt;even quoted me as saying:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;You all are idiots, shut up if you don&#39;t know for sure.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;I happen to know the right answers, but I won&#39;t tell you.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wow, how sad someone reads such despite out of nothing. Please consider<br/>\n&gt;meeting me, or any of the Soerbaird for a truthful assessment of what we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;like.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dendall, Ollave of the Aegis<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking for the perfect gift for a friend?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Tell them about ONElist&#39;s 115,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
