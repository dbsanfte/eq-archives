Because they&#39;re usually dazed until the next hit,<br/>\nit means they usually won&#39;t start casting until just before<br/>\nthe next Strike is about to kick in.  Sometimes the timing<br/>\nwill get out of synch (someone hits them immediately after<br/>\ntheir eyes glaze and they immediately start to cast) and<br/>\nthey&#39;ll get one or two spells off, but I&#39;ve been in numerous<br/>\nfights where the caster never got a single spell off because I<br/>\nwas continually Striking them.  In 95% of the fights I do<br/>\nthis, the caster gets off 2 spells or fewer.  It&#39;s so<br/>\neffective that I&#39;ve been trying to decide whether I should<br/>\njust drop Elemental Rhythms and rely only on Strike when<br/>\nfacing casters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; consider the &quot;rhythm&quot; series to be useless as well, until I started using it<br/>\n&gt; against Shadowmen and resisted 6 or 7 Fears in a row.  I&#39;ll definitely keep<br/>\n&gt; playing with it, but I consider it to be overshadowed by charm, lullaby,<br/>\n&gt; screech, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Strike is much more reliable in terms of duration than<br/>\nLullaby.  When facing 2-3 mobs that are reasonably spaced out<br/>\nfor easy targeting, I *always* use Strike instead of Lullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharm as I mentioned doesn&#39;t let you re-charm until the mob<br/>\nhas become uncharmed.  That means the mob will 100% guaranteed<br/>\nhave a window of time in which to attack you ever 10-15 sec.<br/>\nWith Strike, you can Strike over and over indefinitely and<br/>\nit&#39;ll never or rarely wake up.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
