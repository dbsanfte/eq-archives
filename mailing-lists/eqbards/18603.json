Rumour has it <br/>\nthat this lake is supposed to be salty - and this might even be supported <br/>\nby the river that flows (uphill in some places) from the ocean to the lake <br/>\n- but if that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be - where is all the water <br/>\ngoing?  And why isn&#39;t this whole zone flooded?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - it started out as an argument about why the water flowed from the <br/>\nocean into the lake, instead of backwards - until we remembered that <br/>\nthere&#39;s some NPC that says the lake is salty...<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
