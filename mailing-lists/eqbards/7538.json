Camp bard and play cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was 6+ hours in total. Over 5 of those hours<br/>\nwere spent running naked across Antonica. I am<br/>\nnot making any of that up. Yes, I offered to pay<br/>\nfor the binds. Aparently 5pp isn&#39;t worth the mana<br/>\nto people in Highpass. Yay, now I own 4 more<br/>\ndrums than I did before. *twirls finger*<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes me somewhere between an hour to an hour<br/>\nand a half to run non-stop from Freeport to Qeynos.<br/>\nIf I die along the way, it&#39;s definitely an<br/>\n&quot;incredible hardship&quot; as you put it. I could have<br/>\nbeen practicing my brewing or gaining experience or<br/>\njust talking to friends for those 6 hours rather<br/>\nthan running around naked doing absolutely NOTHING<br/>\nenjoyable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo tell me please. Where is the balance in this?<br/>\nAnd don&#39;t give me that &quot;You just had bad luck&quot;<br/>\nline. I&#39;m not the only person things like this<br/>\nhappen to and this isn&#39;t the only time I&#39;ve had<br/>\nsomething like this happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nCount the zones: Bound on Freeport docks  so each<br/>\ndeath means going through 3 zones just to buy<br/>\nanother drum and head out the West Gates. But<br/>\nlet&#39;s not count those.<br/>\n<br/>\nW.Freeport, E.Commons, W.Commons, Kithicor,<br/>\nHighpass, E.Karana, N.Karana<br/>\n8 Zones on each death.<br/>\n<br/>\nW.Karana, Q.Hills, Qeynos<br/>\n3 more zones to destination.<br/>\n<br/>\n4 x 8 = 32 zones + 3 on the trip that I actually<br/>\narrived in Qeynos for. That&#39;s 35 zones I had to<br/>\ngo through to get to Qeynos on this fateful trip.<br/>\n(Add another 9 to count the &#39;drum runs&#39; for 41<br/>\nzones in actuality) Let&#39;s compare a caster that<br/>\ncan bind at each new zone border they cross.<br/>\n<br/>\n11 zones. Tops.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat balancing act.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
