Like most <br/>\n&gt; people - if you<br/>\n&gt; TELL me to do something I wouldn&#39;t do otherwise - I&#39;m going <br/>\n&gt; to be negatively<br/>\n&gt; disposed towards it.  However if you ask me - nicely - it&#39;s a <br/>\n&gt; different<br/>\n&gt; thing entirely.  When I hear &quot;Play manasong please&quot; - <br/>\n&gt; particularly from a<br/>\n&gt; cleric or enchanter - odds are - I&#39;ll include in my song <br/>\n&gt; twist - even if I<br/>\n&gt; feel that it&#39;s less than ideal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
