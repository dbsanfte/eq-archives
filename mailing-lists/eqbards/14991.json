In gorge,<br/>\nmy group was actually cooperating with some other people in the area<br/>\n(what a crazy idea, eh?).  Basically my group of three (lvl 16 war,<br/>\ncleric, wiz) and a 17 sk (solo) and a 16 druid (solo) were all pulling<br/>\nto the Runnyeye zone.  It was a good relationship, our war would pull<br/>\nextra mobs of the druid, she would give him the damage shield/sow.  I<br/>\nended up having to root occasional runners for the sk because of the<br/>\nteleoprting problem.  (At first I dont think he wanted to ask for a<br/>\nroot, normally he was just paying me for occasional heals, 1PP for<br/>\n&quot;Healing&quot;, 1PP for center/holy armor, but after 10 minutes of watching<br/>\nhim chase, come back, chase, come back, I figured out what was going on<br/>\nand told him just to give me a message when he needed a root.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In MM, the main problem is that mobs don&#39;t take a straight<br/>\n&gt; line route to get to you.  Anything you pull from or in front<br/>\n&gt; of the ballroom runs through the ballroom, out the back,<br/>\n&gt; through the negotiator room, and then towards you.  On the<br/>\n&gt; way, it picks up all the mobs in the ballroom, the negotiator<br/>\n&gt; room, and the gargoyles in between.  (There are other pathing<br/>\n&gt; problems, but this is the big one.  Second would have to be<br/>\n&gt; that annoying mob which immediately runs for the castle when<br/>\n&gt; it sees you - doesn&#39;t even bother to attack.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Theres a froglok in Guk that would do this.  He&#39;d see our warrior, and<br/>\ntake off (never having been attacked) for the well room.  I think our<br/>\nwarrior figured out to sit down, and call for one of the casters to come<br/>\nroot it when he saw it...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
