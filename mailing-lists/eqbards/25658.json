Verant has also commented that we should see more <br/>\nand more of these as time goes on.<br/>\n   vs resist damage, on the other hand, is treated differently.  The bonus <br/>\nvalue is calculated as an increased DMG stat on the weapon, except that the <br/>\nelemental portion is run through the resistance system before calculating <br/>\nthe strength of your hit. I believe the way that this would work is if you <br/>\nhad a 10/30 +4 fire sword, it would be treated like a 14/30, but the 4 (and <br/>\nassociated bonuses) would be given a chance to resist, so, depending on <br/>\nresistance checks, the weapon would do anywhere from 10-14 / 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
