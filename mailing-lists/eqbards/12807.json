If you don&#39;t have line of<br/>\n&gt; sight, it sometimes won&#39;t work.  As it says<br/>\n&gt; in the various song analyses, All this does is Give you the<br/>\n&gt; factions that the mob you targets has  This<br/>\n&gt; can have various effects on the /con.  Most of the time, this<br/>\n&gt; will improve on how they view you.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes, however, you can have better or the same faction<br/>\n&gt; with them already.  Other times, the mob has<br/>\n&gt; no faction, like gypsies, so the song does nothing.  This<br/>\n&gt; song will not make a monster who is &quot;ready to<br/>\n&gt; attack&quot; you non-aggro.  It has been debated whether using a<br/>\n&gt; wind instrument has any effect on this song.<br/>\n&gt; My opinion is that it doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
