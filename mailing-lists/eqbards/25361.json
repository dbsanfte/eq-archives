To bring you up to date, I lucked into a Horn of Hsagra, doing a<br/>\n&gt; low-level quest in Ak&#39;Anon (probably due to a loot-table mixup).  I offered<br/>\n&gt; it to a friend of mine who is in a guild, and he said to write my own<br/>\n&gt; ticket.  So I did.  I requested the Lute of the Howler, and some coins for<br/>\n&gt; the Nostrolo Tambourine quest.  I didn&#39;t expect to get all of that, but I<br/>\n&gt; was hopeful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Today I got a call, requesting my presence in West Commons.  There, I was<br/>\n&gt; presented, in trade for the Horn, a bag containing one Lute of the Howler,<br/>\n&gt; 6 Ancient Coins, and 18 peridots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d say I did well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.
