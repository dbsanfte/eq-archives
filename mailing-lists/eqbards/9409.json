We went down<br/>\nthe inlet between the barb village and the gypsies.  There is an aviak tower<br/>\nthere with two guards that are about lvl 19 or 20.  If you can get back<br/>\nthere, you&#39;ll get suh-weeeeeeet experience up to about 24.  At that point,<br/>\nhead over to Hermie&#39;s hut in SK.  Stay there til 28, good money AND exp!  (I<br/>\nlearned the fine art of Fear/Chain there  heh!)  I&#39;ve found that if I can<br/>\nfind a good spot for blue cons to spawn, I can make MUCH MORE experience<br/>\nthan in any group.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you reconsider,<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kenneth E.
