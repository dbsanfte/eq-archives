Back to the Pyramid<br/>\nand Crypt and Emperor&#39;s Tomb.  Among the stuff we hauled out was a<br/>\nJourneyman&#39;s Walking Stick (although it looks like a mace rather than a<br/>\nstick - go figure).  It&#39;s 1HB, 9 24, str, int & wis +4 and effect: Tashani.<br/>\nOur group debated the worth of this thing and they mostly &quot;poo-poo&#39;d&quot; it<br/>\n(since it was not &#39;uber&#39; wep.)  Well, I told them I would be happy to have<br/>\nit - having neglected my 1HB since putting away the old Staff of Writhing 10<br/>\nlevels ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh, here is the good part.  JWS in primary hand, weave Chant of Battle<br/>\n(+dex) and Fufill&#39;s (-mr), the stick proc&#39;s nicely and the combind -mr<br/>\nallows my Yk in my offhand to stick a proc on the Emperor!  Heh, the Yk has<br/>\nsome value again.  Nice to see a wep proc (Yeksha, since Tash is not<br/>\nresisted usually) on a *red* mob (Emperor Chottal)!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess you could switch JWS to offhand as soon as you see it proc (Tash is<br/>\na fairly long lasting effect) and get they Yak in the main hand so it procs<br/>\nsooner and more often since its 75 DD each time it procs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, we did manage to down the Ancient Jarseth - he&#39;s a meanie.<br/>\nLong melee for us (3 bards, chain & fear) after he killed our wizard (no one<br/>\nhad charm loaded nor could get him off the wiz quick enough.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went into Chardok.  Met a level 51 at the zone.  He seemed to be bugged<br/>\n(ie someone prior had pulled him to the zone and he was &#39;stuck&#39; there -<br/>\nsince we did not expect such a high level mob right there) but we killed<br/>\nhim.  The other zone patrollers and statics were not that bad (we had heard<br/>\nhorror storys.)  And we clear around to the zone out.  The monk pulling for<br/>\nus brought some stuff from the first building. After we got the easy ones,<br/>\nhe began to complain about &quot;chain agro&quot; and was not able to bring out<br/>\nsingles.  Eventually, I think we zoned out after pulling a bit more than we<br/>\ncould handle (no enchanter was along and there were too many for me to do<br/>\neffective crowd control.)  Another zone with nobody in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, we were working our way out of Crypt in Old Seb when we encountered<br/>\nwhat would normally be a 3 pull of krup froogs.  As the group talked about<br/>\nwhat to do, I asked to try my lull (lament) and they said &#39;sure&#39; since we<br/>\nhad 2 enchanters and normally just pull all 3 and deal with it.  They were<br/>\nrather amazed to see the lull work so well.  We might have been able to walk<br/>\npast them with out agroing.  The first one pulled almost right on top of the<br/>\nsecond lulled mob and he just sat there.  These are level 54 enchanters who<br/>\nare not easily impressed - but Lament impressed them that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally,  I spent some time cleaning out the bank account.  Decided to<br/>\ngo do the crafted armor quest with a griffon eye.  Bought 2 Fire Emeralds in<br/>\nFV and teleported to NK.  Went to see the Centies and even made him tell me<br/>\nabout the quest.  But when I gave him the stuff, he gave me the &quot;aren&#39;t you<br/>\nforgetting something&quot; for the eye (which I expected) and then nothing for<br/>\nthe gems.  Sheesh.  This is the 2nd time in a month that I have failed doing<br/>\ncrafted armor quest.  Other one was for crafted bp - lost the werewolf talon<br/>\nand rubys. Grrrr.  Of course, I petitioned and was told &quot;sorry, can&#39;t<br/>\nreplace items... send email to ...&quot;  Anyone else know anything about the<br/>\ncrafted armor being bugged somehow?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
