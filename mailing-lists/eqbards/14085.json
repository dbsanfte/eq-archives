The warping in Q Hills makes things that run<br/>\naway reappear at the zone line to Qeynos every time.  Its different, and<br/>\nmuch more ridiculous if that&#39;s possible, than the warping that makes mobs<br/>\nappear to teleport across small distances.  It&#39;s kill more low level players<br/>\nthan I can imagine every time Holly gets trained to that zoneline.  What is<br/>\nwith that warping anyhow?  How does it get so confused, the pathing in Q<br/>\nHills must really suck.  Hmm maybe they just copied the pathing code from BB<br/>\nover and they can&#39;t find the ramps.  8p<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 31, 2000 11:01 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] (OT) Lower level discrimination was Play Time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 31 Jan 2000, Ryan Honeyman wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m just saying the game was cool and now it sucks big pointy Cazics, <br/>\n&gt;   that&#39;s all. ;p  Oh, and now instead of a blocky hill giant warping<br/>\n&gt;   on top me, a pretty multitextured, high polycount, antialaised giant<br/>\n&gt;   will be warping on top of me ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust so you folks know, warping like this is a function of<br/>\nping*PL/bandwidth.  We have to deal with this stuff (minimize<br/>\nit) all the time for the stuff my company does.
