Dex and Str are melee abilities, Dex allowing you to miss less, and<br/>\n&gt; Str allowing you to hit harder (and carry more of course).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Has anyone found much noticable improvement with these skills over 100<br/>\nor so? I tried collecting all the dex, str and agility items I could<br/>\nborrow from friends or had stuck away in my bank and I really couldn&#39;t<br/>\nsee much difference in how often I hit between around 105 dex to up to<br/>\n128 dex. Likewise pumping agility from 102 to around 130 (counting<br/>\nranger&#39;s feet like cat buff) seemed to not really cause me to get<br/>\nhit noticably less. Strength doesn&#39;t seem to matter much either bumped<br/>\nfrom my usual 117 up to 157 with items, and various strenth buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople seem to think there&#39;s certain &quot;magic&quot; numbers where&#39;s there&#39;s a<br/>\nhuge leap in improvement. The one&#39;s I&#39;ve heard are 76 and 100, and some<br/>\nsay another at 150, but it seems over 100 doesn&#39;t noticably make a lot<br/>\nof difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
