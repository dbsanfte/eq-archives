Log on and find my friends are playing their<br/>\nBards too.  Meet up in Steamfont with them and another<br/>\nfriend who is a Ranger.  I&#39;m level 13, there are 2<br/>\nlevel 11 Bards, and a Level 11 Ranger in the group<br/>\nnow.  Mino Caves.  Simple, they been conning Blue to<br/>\nme since level 10.<br/>\n<br/>\n4:30 Enter Caves.  Nobody else has been in this zone. <br/>\nThe Ranger decides to pull (tracking).  Goes down a<br/>\ncorridor &quot;Hey...who is Meld.....&quot;  Hoarde of Guards<br/>\nand Meldrath himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOW LOADING...<br/>\n<br/>\nGet together and head back to recover bodies.  Hear<br/>\nshout of &quot;HERO OUT&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOW LOADING....<br/>\n<br/>\nWell Now...aint that something?  hehe.  Still in a<br/>\ndecent mood, not like I haven&#39;t died before.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWatch 5 more trains go by.  Meldrath in one, Hero in<br/>\nanother.  One is just like 5 Guards.  <br/>\nGuards pick up on my trail.  Selo&#39;s...no drum (its<br/>\nstill on my corpse).  Make it to town.  Guards<br/>\nactually KILL the mino train (YEA!) Exit<br/>\ntunnel....&quot;HERO TO TOWN&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNOW LOADING....<br/>\n<br/>\nFORGET THIS....<br/>\nFriend (level 11 Bard No 1) Logs on his Lev 32 Druid<br/>\nfor corpse recovery (the Ranger is way in).  I Have my<br/>\nLev 25 Cleric handy in this area (just in case).<br/>\n<br/>\nRecovery is made....FINALLY.  Everyone logs for dinner<br/>\n(they are PST, I am EST) except me.<br/>\n<br/>\n8PM.  Forget about Mino caves.  Too many Trains now. <br/>\nTime to head back to Antonica.<br/>\n<br/>\n8:30 Freeport, get a bind RIGHT AWAY (God Bless<br/>\nGuildmates) and get ALL BUFFED UP.  Refuse offers to<br/>\nbring on Cleric (everyone misses their band-aid since<br/>\nI became addicted to Bard), and head to NRO for Dervs.<br/>\n<br/>\nCant find ANYONE interested in a Bard for a Derv<br/>\ngroup.  Not uncommon, most players don&#39;t realize how<br/>\nuseful a bard is until 20&#39;s (I sure didn&#39;t..but I<br/>\nlearned FAST then).  Hear a cry for help.  Some newbie<br/>\npoisoned and dying on beach.<br/>\n<br/>\nRun along beach, find him....Group him up and play<br/>\nHymn with Lute.  Druid comes along and cures his<br/>\npoison, while I restore his health.<br/>\n<br/>\nNewbie offers me a rusty two hander in payment (he is<br/>\nlevel 5, not twinked...BIG GENEROUS OFFER from him).<br/>\nI turn him down, and feel good.<br/>\n<br/>\nShout once more for a group.  Druid replies that Croc<br/>\ngroup is forming at Docks (levs 11 to 13).  Perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nHead to Oasis full speed and group up.  Pull with<br/>\nSelo&#39;s (Druid doesnt have SOW yet) and buff with Chant<br/>\nduring battles, twisting with whatever situation calls<br/>\nfor.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell...Started night one bubble from level 14.  Left<br/>\nSteamfont one bubble INTO 14 (some random deaths from<br/>\ntrains not mentioned).  Left Oasis one bubble from 14<br/>\nagain.  Broke even and had a blast.  Met some nice<br/>\nfolks who REALLY appreciate what a bard can bring to a<br/>\ngroup now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMORAL:  Forget the cleric, he&#39;s collecting dust. <br/>\nDeaths and all, BARDS ARE TOO FUN.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWindolas (MM Server)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
