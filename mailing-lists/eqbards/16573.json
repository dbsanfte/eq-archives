From the emails I have recently gotten it did seem that GZ was<br/>\nbeginning to think bards were more caster than hybrid in some ways, but I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t think their mood had switched that far.  Must be a result of playing<br/>\none and seeing first hand how far behind the other hybrids our melee ability<br/>\nreally is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ideas I like best are the group bind anywhere, the evac with random<br/>\ndestination, and some kind of stun.  There are numerous classes with stun<br/>\nability already, cleric, enchanter, necro, wizard.  To balance the stun it<br/>\nwould probably have to be AoE to limit its use in dungeons and last only 1<br/>\ntick.  Still a six second stun would be nice, but using it continuously<br/>\nwould mean not weaving any other songs in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than these I agree we need some kind of better group buffing songs.<br/>\nShamans can already buff an entire group better than we can without<br/>\nexceeding their mana regen rate.  We need to get something so good that<br/>\ngroups will be torn between having us sing that or mana song.  Anything to<br/>\nforce people to not have us as group members solely for mana song would be a<br/>\nhuge plus.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn improved Healing song is probably a must, an improved combat speedup song<br/>\nlike Anthem perhaps as well.  Perhaps a single target, burn all mana,<br/>\nmega-damage song similar to the insta kills other classes are getting at 60,<br/>\nat least if you believe the files.  My guess is those are the bogus spells<br/>\nGZ added in though.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tork [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tdomeii@...\">tdomeii@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 20, 2000 7:57 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] emergency: please read reguarding new bard songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Tork &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tdomeii@...\">tdomeii@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNameless crashed tonight and in the chat room<br/>\nGM-Hideaki was there.
