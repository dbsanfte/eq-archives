If so, I&#39;m interested<br/>\n&gt; in why one would choose Chant of Battle over Anthem. My current lineup at<br/>\n&gt; level 16 (DING! - I *love* the jig! It&#39;s so much more entertaining if while<br/>\n&gt; watching it, you sing to yourself - &quot;Do a little dance, Make a little love,<br/>\n&gt; Get down tonight! Get down tonight!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Yesterday, I changed from using Jonthan&#39;s, hymn, wince or<br/>\nsometimes Jonthan&#39;s, hymn, anthem, wince combination to<br/>\nusing just chant, jonthan and hymn. I might be just hallucinating<br/>\nbut I thought I noticed a HUGE difference in my melee ability.<br/>\nI guess the dex bonus from chant really pays off. The 5% from<br/>\nstacking anthem isn&#39;t that great compared to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Locating, Aquatic Ayre and Cindra&#39;s Charismatic Carillion (even though I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t noticed it doing much good). When soloing I usually stack Jonthans,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  And btw, the Carillion seems to increase _your_ faction with the<br/>\ntargeted person until you zone or re-log. Which means, any else<br/>\nNPC with the same faction is also boosted. Hit carillion once and<br/>\nall the npc&#39;s in one zone usually end up amiable if indifferent =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Songs that I&#39;ve noticed don&#39;t seem to do much are the Rhythm songs and the<br/>\n&gt; Lucid Lullaby (Rats outside of Freeport were resisting it to me last night<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Lullaby is resisted quite a bit yes.. It&#39;s pretty much only good if you<br/>\nhave a group that whacks a multible mob situation one by one, and<br/>\nyou just lullaby time after time and hope for best =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; whether to get the song since it&#39;s another in the line of Rhythms. Is it me<br/>\n&gt; doing something wrong, or are these songs either very weak or completely<br/>\n&gt; useless?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  They start to be useful when you start fighting casters. But at low levels,<br/>\nif you fight a caster solo it will be a close call, and if you fight a caster<br/>\nwith group its usually a massacre =) Higher up, it will change that if you<br/>\nfight a caster solo, it will be a massacre and if you fight it with a group<br/>\nit can still be a close call ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Ilkka Salmenkaita, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:isalmen@...\">isalmen@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
