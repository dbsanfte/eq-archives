I later confirmed that everytime I played niv&#39;s with that lute... I flung my arms out.  I will test it with other strings, but another bard got the correct graphic when using his 7-string...<br/>\n<br/>\nHas this been around for awhile or what?<br/>\n<br/>\nKerouac Dharmabum<br/>\nlvl 50<br/>\nRodcent Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
