Good thing we had a ranger with<br/>\nus &lt;g&gt;.  Also funny to see Inny apparently target one of us then AE nuke and<br/>\ntake damage from his own spell - heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nSunderfury, Beckon and the Wizard&#39;s Diamond wand?

My songs:  Dirge,<br/>\nPurifying, Guardian, Hymn, CoCess, Niv&#39;s, Bind Sight, and Clarity.
