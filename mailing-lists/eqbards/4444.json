A barbed whip typically sells<br/>\nfor about 80-150pp, and it has a worse damage/delay ratio<br/>\nthan the dirk and no magical modifiers.  The dirk price is<br/>\nslowly climbing now that Dvinn doesn&#39;t carry it all the time<br/>\nanymore.  If JM&#39;s 10% figure is right, I expect it&#39;ll level<br/>\nout at about the same price as a barbed whip.  While it&#39;s<br/>\nbetter than the whip, it&#39;s still a lot easier to get since<br/>\nit&#39;s &quot;right there&quot; in Crushbone.  I think the whip is rarer<br/>\nthan 10% as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for those about to jump in that my prices are off, I&#39;ve<br/>\nnoticed significant price variability depending on what server<br/>\nyou&#39;re on.  Most seem to put the whip in the 80-150 range, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen quotes as low as 40-50, and as high as 200-300.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
