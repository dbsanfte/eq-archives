Woohoo, this <br/>\n&gt; is not bad at all...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you sure?  Last I checked, Elemental and Purifying Rhythms<br/>\ndid not stack.  Guardian Rhythms will however stack with<br/>\neither of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Jaxan&#39;s Jig O&#39; Vigor: I have taken up memming this song again lately, as <br/>\n&gt; some long fights will really sap my fatigue.  This little gem is something I <br/>\n&gt; only use once a fight, but I think it helps a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There was a mob in Mistmoore that hit me with some oddball<br/>\nspell I&#39;ve never heard of before that completely drained my<br/>\nstamina.  I didn&#39;t have the Jig memorized, so I just switched<br/>\nto instruments and let my party bash its brains out while I<br/>\nwaited for my stamina to regenerate naturally.  That&#39;ll teach<br/>\nit for picking on a bard.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Cinda´┐¢s Charismatic Carillon and Tarew´┐¢s Aquatic Ayre:  <br/>\n&gt; has anyone out there noticed any change in these songs<br/>\n&gt; when using a wind instrument?

(Verant employee who used to be on this list) said an<br/>\ninstrument doesn&#39;t affect the Aquatic Ayre.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; seems to be the same, and with both songs it appears to be<br/>\n&gt; all-or-nothing ´┐¢ either the song works completely or it<br/>\n&gt; doesn´┐¢t.

(Btw,<br/>\nthe faction increase *will* help you complete quests like the<br/>\nSquad Ring - I did it with my enchanter using the Alliance<br/>\nspell, though it still took a helluva lot of belts and beads.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;amiable&quot;.  Strangely, the level of the NPC does not seem<br/>\n&gt; to affect the success of this song.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because the song affects *you* not the NPC.  :-)  It<br/>\nchanges *your* faction with the target NPC&#39;s group.  It does<br/>\nnot affect the NPC at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust be careful you don&#39;t accidently try to Lament or charm<br/>\nthe merchant instead of using the Carillon.  The Carillon<br/>\nproduces an immediate message - if you don&#39;t immediately see<br/>\nit, TURN THE SONG OFF BEFORE YOU&#39;RE KILLED!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
