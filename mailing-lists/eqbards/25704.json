At<br/>\n30 you may be a tad low - but you can start (and if the bard is a second<br/>\ncharacter - while the drum is no-drop the coins aren&#39;t) - so you can collect<br/>\nthe coin on the other char - and complete the quest on your bard.  A lot of<br/>\npeople ask a lot of money for MM drums - so you can avoid that cost by doing<br/>\nthe coin quest which is a tad time consuming but doesn&#39;t cost much money.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the DE mask - note that the advantage of not being KOS only works<br/>\nif you are agnostic.  Mobs in EQ can tell your &quot;God&quot; so if you chose one -<br/>\nyou&#39;ll probably still be KOS regardless of the mast.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless - it&#39;s a very good item to wear - and the illusion is fun - and<br/>\nthe ultravision can be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n58 Bard on Xegony Server<br/>\nCouncilor, Dragons of Kel`Dar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
