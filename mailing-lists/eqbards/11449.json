You are<br/>\n&gt; mistaken however about our ability to hit magic only creatures.  Magic<br/>\n&gt; gloves only started working as a magic attack for anyone other then monks<br/>\n&gt; about 4 patches ago IE about 2 months ago before that it was weapons or<br/>\n&gt; songs and that was the only damage you did.
