Things went well. We had 2 chanters and one or the<br/>\nother died a time or 2 but the other took care of the mobs til we got the<br/>\nother rez&#39;ed back in. As chance would have it, we had a big pull, nothing<br/>\nthat we hadn&#39;t already done, but somehow we kept aquiring more mobs. One<br/>\nchanter died, mine was still alive but struggling to cast under fire. I<br/>\nstarted SoT&#39;ing things off of her but she died anyway. Both chanters are<br/>\ndown and a couple more mobs show up. Each bard picks a couple mobs and SoT&#39;s<br/>\nstart flying. We were able to keep everything pinned down til one by one the<br/>\nmobs died. It Really helped that the shaman slowed all the mobs as quick as<br/>\npossible. This kept me I know from getting pounded into mush on resists. The<br/>\ngroups made a point to keep things off the clerics and worked with the<br/>\nbards. They picked targets, called them and all stayed on the same one.<br/>\nNo Maestro, no Inny and one bard bracer dropped. I got it by default but I<br/>\nactually think my Kylong bracer is better, for me anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
