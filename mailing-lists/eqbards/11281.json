Mid 30&#39;s place afik.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Choon & Froon (gay clops?) live in West Karana on top of a hill with a<br/>\n&gt; really nice view of the Oger Camp (don&#39;t get near even though they con<br/>\n&gt; amiable - the Chief don&#39;t and he will harm touch for 400 and agro the rest<br/>\n&gt; onto you) and the strolling Hill Giants.  If you enter West K from the NK<br/>\n&gt; near the river past the Stone Bridge, go about 1/3 of the way across the<br/>\n&gt; zone (hmm, kinda tough to judge if you are new to the zone) then go due<br/>\n&gt; North.  Alternatively, you could follow the road thru north<br/>\n&gt; karana and enter<br/>\n&gt; west k on the road.  Keep following it and stay out of the hills.<br/>\n&gt; Skirt the<br/>\n&gt; bottom of the hills (snarf the ghoul messenger boy, werewolfie, and any<br/>\n&gt; meandering HG&#39;s if you want) and look for a shop where Brenzl<br/>\n&gt; McManus sells<br/>\n&gt; his fletching goods (track Brenzl if you can).  Right behind his shop - up<br/>\n&gt; on the hill Choon and Froon.  Yes, if you work argo radius, you<br/>\n&gt; can pull em<br/>\n&gt; singles, I found that out when I tried to Lament and pulled a single.<br/>\n&gt; Fear-Chain-DoT-DD, rinse, repeat.  I prefer to have a helper and SoW.  I<br/>\n&gt; tried to charm one time and was resisted - but that was a couple<br/>\n&gt; levels back<br/>\n&gt; and maybe did not wear all my cha stuff.  They are prolly low 30&#39;s - high<br/>\n&gt; 20&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.\t Freeport bards guild - the guy upstairs can train you in the basics<br/>\n&gt; of ID.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom:\tMichal Hobson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSent:\tMonday, December 06, 1999 9:55 AM<br/>\n&gt; \t\tTo:\tEQBards<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSubject:\t[eqbards]  3 questions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\tHello all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\tI have a few questions this morning for everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t1)  Which room in Mistmoore is the home of the gypsy lute<br/>\n&gt; dropping gypsies?  How do I get there?  Is there a secret way<br/>\n&gt; (i.e. through<br/>\n&gt; the secret room in the graveyard) which could be less hazardous to a group<br/>\n&gt; of around 30&#39;s? (I too share Shada&#39;s propensity for being lost - hehe.  My<br/>\n&gt; train hotkey shouts &quot;TRAIN TO......UM......Just watch out!&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; Once I get to<br/>\n&gt; said room, how difficult a place is it?  3 spawns, 4?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t2)  Where are Choon and Froon (I&#39;ve spent the vast majority<br/>\n&gt; of my time on the East coast, so I&#39;m not too familiar with the Karanas)?<br/>\n&gt; About what level are they?  Is it possible to pull one without the other?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\tAnd in another non-related vein:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\tCan anyone please post or supply the web address to a<br/>\n&gt; comprehensive list of Bard skill caps?
