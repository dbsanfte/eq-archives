Nobody seems to have any<br/>\nGolden Amber Earrings to sell.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a wimpy Wood Elf trying to wear heavy Bronze, I&#39;m on a quest for<br/>\nitems to increase my STR.  I&#39;ve got a purity belt and a spiked collar.<br/>\nI thought the Golden Amber Earrings would be easy enough to find, but<br/>\nnot so far...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem is I don&#39;t know where these come from.  Are they loot?  Are<br/>\nthey jewelcraft?  My normal modus operandi is to wander over to wherever<br/>\nthe loot comes from and /auction there...<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any better suggestions for +str items?  And if so, where do<br/>\nthey come from and what do they usually sell for?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\n- Luvas of Fennin Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
