I&#39;m not sure what starts the whole<br/>\nagro circus, maybe some bug of leftover bard code from when our songs<br/>\naffected everyone in the radius and not just those grouped with.  Whatever<br/>\nstarts it I do understand now how it gets passed and why it doesn&#39;t go away<br/>\nwhen you zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens is somehow a wolf, in this example, gets you on its hate list.<br/>\nWhen it happens you are out of &#39;chase&#39; range so the wolf goes on its merry<br/>\nway passing its hate for you on to other wolves it meets in its travels.<br/>\nPretty soon every wolf in the zone hates you.  As soon as you come within<br/>\n&#39;chase&#39; range of a wolf that hates you, he beelines for you.  Since &#39;chase&#39;<br/>\nrange is so much larger than agro range in Kunark and Velious, it is readily<br/>\napparent how weird the event is when it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are grouped, your groupmates are also on the hate list of all these<br/>\nwolves.  You camp, the list is cleared... for you.  You come back and group<br/>\nwith the former groupmate, still ok.  You pulse one song on that groupmate<br/>\nthough and suddenly you get added to the hate list of every single mob that<br/>\nhas the groupmate on their hatelist in the entire zone.  How wolves halfway<br/>\nacross the island know you cast a beneficial spell on an enemy is a mystery,<br/>\nbut that&#39;s VI logic for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
