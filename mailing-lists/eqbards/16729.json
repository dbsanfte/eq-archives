Still, I doubt casual gamers like myself will ever get beyond<br/>\n35th level unless the game and my interest last for 3+ years which I think<br/>\nunlikely.  Should we all be relegated to being casters then?  Should I<br/>\nendure 35+ levels as second or third fiddle, just so I can be there when<br/>\nsome caster who&#39;s had it easy all his life comes whining for &#39;daddy&#39;?<br/>\nBalance should never be level dependent.  The balance switch at ultra-high<br/>\nlevels is totally artificial anyhow.  If it wasn&#39;t for the &#39;special&#39; powers<br/>\ngiven them, any group of 6 wizards of 49th level could simply walk up to<br/>\nCazic and Nuke him to oblivion.  He has what 10,000 hps?  10 Ice Comets<br/>\nwould do more than that.  Use 2 groups of wizards and it becomes even<br/>\nsillier.  Unless you make these Uber-mobs nigh on immune to magic there<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be any strategy, you cannot give them enough hp&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill my main point stands.  It does not fix the problem to tell me, &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>\nworry at very high levels you will be desperately needed.&quot;  I do not look<br/>\nforward to the day when casters must beg me to join in so they can<br/>\naccomplish something.  I&#39;d much rather we were all balanced all the time and<br/>\nalways needed each other, or at least had something significant to gain by<br/>\nworking together.  My group last nite in Sol A was the perfect example.  Me,<br/>\na shaman, a wizard, an enchanter, and a necromancer.  The only reason they<br/>\nwanted me was because enchanter pets are too stupid to tank.  I was a<br/>\nbarrier plain and simple.  I wasn&#39;t really necessary, but having me meant<br/>\nthere was no way any of them were going to die.  If anyone went down it was<br/>\ngoing to be me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 23, 2000 1:41 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Here&#39;s one for the list to answer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni know you have argued this for a long long time Kit, but i must say<br/>\nsomething.  do you know how absolutely vital, critical, and in all ways a<br/>\nMUST melee classes are at high levels?  nothing in the high level game can<br/>\nbe done without a lot of melee characters in your group or groups.  so what<br/>\nis the definition of balance then?  ability to solo, or necessity to a<br/>\ngrooup, raid, or event?  melee classes are not only invaluable but a total<br/>\nnecessity at high levels, so could your argument follow at low to mid levels<br/>\nand then reverse itself at high levels?  just an alternate scenario to<br/>\nponder and discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Powa, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, L48 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The<br/>\n&gt; imbalance between pure casters and everyone else is so huge <br/>\n&gt; its embarrassing<br/>\n&gt; and yet no one at Verant will acknowledge it in any way.  <br/>\n&gt; They should have<br/>\n&gt; named the game Evercast if this is the way they really want <br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMAXIMIZE YOUR CARD, MINIMIZE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
