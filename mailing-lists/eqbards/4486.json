I was jaunting back to<br/>\nFreeport after killing some crocs the other day and assumed she was a vendor<br/>\n(like in E. Commons, where they are consistently not in the inns but rather<br/>\nin front of them or on top of them....still haven&#39;t figured that out yet)<br/>\nand she screamed something at me just before she quadruple whacked me for<br/>\n127hp per slap.  I have removed Dorn from my list now though....hehe it was<br/>\nwith a group and we almost died but I still feel better.  Oh yes, add the<br/>\nspectres to that list as well and a PC Dark Elf caster Xcelsior who trained<br/>\nthem on us about 10 times the other day.  I personally only died twice.  One<br/>\nguy in my group had bound himself just far enough down the beach so that<br/>\nafter they killed him the each time, he appeared right in front of them as<br/>\nthey came back down the beach.  He died 6 times in a space of 10 minutes<br/>\n(with zoning to starting point) poor guy.  It was however rather fun to<br/>\nwatch them kill two sand giants and Lockjaw before they finally stayed home<br/>\nfor good.  Leaving a string of 40 bodies along the beach, was not pretty,<br/>\nnor was the ensuing spam fest that went on afterwards.  Oh yeah add all the<br/>\ntroll guards at the entrance to Grobb too.  I owe them 3 lives, long story.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland of Freeport<br/>\nBard of the 16th chorus<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
