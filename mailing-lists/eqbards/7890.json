Well due to level 50 boredom, I make a newbie dark<br/>\nelf on the test server and went to check it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are indeed 2 bard NPCs there, but they were in fact the only 2<br/>\nNPCs in there who wouldnt talk to me. They con&#39;d apprehensive, while<br/>\neverything else was indifferent no matter what race/class it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I&#39;ve only seen NPCs for misc stuff (resetting your specialization<br/>\nskills), Necros, Wizards, Mages, Clerics, and Bards. So guess we lucked<br/>\nout so far unless they&#39;re still adding other quest NPCs for other<br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
