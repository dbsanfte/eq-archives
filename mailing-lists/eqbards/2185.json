They think either think that a Bard sucks as a tank, or sucks at a<br/>\n&gt; healer, or sucks at something else, and there&#39;s always someone that could<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; something better than a Bard!  I recently tried to discuss the advantages<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; a Bard in a party with some guy on the EQVault board, but he really didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to understand what I was saying about the advantages of Bards.  Alot<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; people have their own ideas on things, sometimes something happened to<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; once, and they think it&#39;s a fact from that point onward, sometimes they<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; like to believe in superstition.  The thread on the boat crashing and it<br/>\n&gt; being Bard&#39;s fault is one example.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I typically group with the same people all the time so I generally don&#39;t<br/>\nrun<br/>\n&gt; into these things, except possibly when we add another member.  Maybe when<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re joining they choose to keep their mouths shut a little bit more.<br/>\n&gt;   )  But, I have been asked to not play Selo&#39;s when a Druid joins.... I<br/>\nsay,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Okay, NP, Can I get a SOW?&quot;  : )  IMO Sow is much better for saving a<br/>\nparty<br/>\n&gt; when things turn ugly, cause I don&#39;t have to stick around and make sure<br/>\n&gt; everyone&#39;s under the effects of my song.  I&#39;ve died numerous times this<br/>\nway<br/>\n&gt; while saving the whole party.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the Jig... Every member of my regular party has said it helps.  There<br/>\n&gt; hasn&#39;t been a stopwatch timing kinda thing going, but they still say they<br/>\n&gt; notice it.  Every mana user that groups with us I ask if it helps too, and<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t heard even one person saying no.  I&#39;d say there&#39;s enuf people<br/>\nsaying<br/>\n&gt; Yes, it does, to warrant believing it.  : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s the URL to that EQVault thread if anyone cares to read it....

They were campers).  So I memorized Jig and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;played it, mentioning how I thought it was supposed to increase<br/>\n&gt; regeneration<br/>\n&gt; &gt;%15.  The cleric informed me Jig was making his mana regenerate slower,<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;should have been done by now.&quot;  Far from it for me to play a song not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wanted, forgot the Jig.  After an easy battle and burnt mana, he told me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;indeed, mana regenerates faster without any bard Jig.  Then things became<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nasty, one fellow brought a train and I saved them all with a lullaby,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;no accelerando might I add, and quite a haul to the zone.  But they<br/>\nthought<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they were just good or lucky for all surviving that time and I didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to try explaining to them what I did, so I just camped!  Got me a little<br/>\n&gt; &gt;irritated, just the remark that Jig was making them regenerate slower!?<br/>\n&gt; OO,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that&#39;s what got me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;All I know--these folks were hostile towards bards, and the fellow who<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the leader had to flee so I only met him briefly, perhaps he understood<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; &gt;usefulness better.  When I hit a bad group I don&#39;t stick around, so I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with them maybe ten minutes tops, but perhaps I can&#39;t fault them from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;experiences I&#39;ve had with fellow bard&#39;s I&#39;ve grouped with--some bards<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, this class takes some skill to wield with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;finesse.  I was with a bard once who consistently played hymn when all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;health was full, and only used bellow in battle.  That, now that, got me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;irritated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Er, back to my original question about Jig and Mana, sorry.  Has anyone<br/>\n&gt; done<br/>\n&gt; &gt;any definitive tests on this?  With all my bard songs I have been able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;play around&quot; with them enough, to my satisfaction, to understand O how<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;work.  This is the way I like things, dead reckonings hands-on kind of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;feel&quot; for how they work rather than really writing up numbers myself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thing is, I studied way too much experimental methodology in school to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;really enjoy doing it when I&#39;m playing, heheh.  (Memories of torturing<br/>\nlab<br/>\n&gt; &gt;rats!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;But I have no way to get an instinctive feel for this!  DOES mana<br/>\n&gt; regenerate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;faster with Jig or not?  Anyone really use a stopwatch with a buddy?  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt;friends keep telling me they don&#39;t have stopwatches and have no time for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;testing.  I know it doesn&#39;t make regeneration slower, that cleric tonight<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was just an arse, but I saved him anyway, fool didn&#39;t even realize it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Roop<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;They both have communities at ONElist.
