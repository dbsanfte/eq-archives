I<br/>\n&gt; finally asked a fellow bard about it and he told me you have to train it<br/>\n&gt; with Caskin Marseheart upstairs in the Freeport&#39;s Bard Guild.<br/>\n&gt; Well I went to him and it still wasnt there. Am I dense or something and<br/>\n&gt; skip by it in the list? It should come after the Hand to Hand and Hide<br/>\n&gt; skill in alphabetical order, correct? I also scrolled through the entire<br/>\n&gt; list of skills and still didn&#39;t find it listed anywhere. I also left him<br/>\n&gt; and came back several times and still didn&#39;t see it listed.<br/>\n&gt; Ah well, maybe like I said, I&#39;m just dense and managed to scroll past it<br/>\n&gt; 5 times without ever seeing it. I suppose I&#39;ll check again.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re in the right place.  The skill may be called &quot;Intimidation&quot; though, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember.  I know it was either labelled that or that was what he said<br/>\nto me when I trained in it.  Perhaps both.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFind people who care about what you care about.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAt ONElist:  your connection to community.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
