Most Bard Songs leave an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; icon on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keep the song effect going indefinitely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; screen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
