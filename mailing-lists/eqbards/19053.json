How about <br/>\nsomething as simple as Chant of Poison? <br/>\n<br/>\nAdding another chant would do a couple of things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) When multiple groups (each having a Bard) take on a large MOB, <br/>\nthere will be more song options available. This also will help in <br/>\ngroups consisting of more than one Bard.<br/>\n2) When fighting a MOB with a high resist in one area, a Bard can <br/>\nchoose the other three chants. I.E. In SolB, I might opt for MR, CR, <br/>\nand PR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I way off the mark here? 1) It should be simple to implement, and <br/>\n2) we already have three chants by then, so this will be giving up <br/>\nmore option -- rounding out the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I had the chance to meet Tawney on the raid. It was a pleasure <br/>\nto have met you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
