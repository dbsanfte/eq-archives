Do I have poor memory?   Or am I just inconsistent?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the above. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I would never charge someone to recover their corpse.  This is<br/>\nsomething that usually I can do in under 2 or 3 minutes, and it costs me nothing<br/>\nbut my time.   Sure, sometimes I will say no, either because I am too busy at<br/>\nthe time, or because where they died would be certain death, should I try to<br/>\nfind their body for them.  I guess the main reason I never charge people for<br/>\nthis is that it feels like I would be capitalizing on their misfortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, if I am headed somewhere, like from Kelethin to the docks, and<br/>\nsomeone asks if they can hitch a ride on the bard express, no problem at all,<br/>\nI&#39;m going there anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at running someone a great distance to be a different thing, particularly<br/>\nif you aren&#39;t going there in the first place.  Just as a smith can and should<br/>\ncharge people with the intent of making a profit because of their talent, I see<br/>\nnothing wrong with a bard charging people for a service they would be<br/>\nhard-pressed to come up with elsewhere.  Nobody is making these people cross<br/>\nAntonica, and if you can turn the trip from a dangerous hour long trip to a safe<br/>\n20 minute trip because of your speed and invisibility songs and your guiding<br/>\nexperience, then I see no reason not to.  Nobody would just ask you out of the<br/>\nblue for this service and expect it to be free, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two coppers,<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
