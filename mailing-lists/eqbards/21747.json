Norton and blackice in particular, running on the same<br/>\nmachine, will find and block quite a few different things.<br/>\n<br/>\nif you want to be really safe, try a multi-prong attack, using a hardware<br/>\nrouter (we sell several, most popular seems to be the netgear line, RT311,<br/>\nRT314, etc.)  These provide NAT (network address translation) to hook<br/>\nmultiple machines to the net.  The upside here is that your actual IP<br/>\naddress is assigned to the hardware router, and you use internal<br/>\nnon-routable (i.e. non-traceable) addresses internally. (usually the<br/>\n192.168.0.x range).  on each machine hooked through that router, run a<br/>\nsoftware firewall of some sort, black ice, norton, several others.  even<br/>\nthough the NAT blocks 99% of attacks, if you are still carrying a trojan or<br/>\na few other possibilities, it won&#39;t provide the protection you want.  the<br/>\nsoftware firewalls usally block 99% of the remaining 1%.  Use Norton<br/>\nAntivirus, MacAffee&#39;s, or something and keep your machine scanned regularly.<br/>\nmost of all, NEVER open or run a program that comes from someone or<br/>\nsomewhere you don&#39;t trust, you&#39;ll be happier in the end if you never ran<br/>\nthat &#39;great swimsuit screensaver&#39; or whatever...<br/>\n<br/>\nincidentally, a combination of a hardware router and norton internet<br/>\nsecurity will run you about $250, depending on where/when you get it.  you<br/>\nmight get away with as little as $125 or so, or pay up to bill gates salary<br/>\nfor a really secure setup.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\nBard of 26 Songs<br/>\nSolusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. if you need any specifics, shoot me an email.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mott, Mike J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.j.mott@...\">mike.j.mott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 06, 2000 10:08 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] OT: Recommendation for a home firewall<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if any of you out there are using firewall software in<br/>\n&gt; conjunction with EQ.
