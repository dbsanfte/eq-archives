Its just that this topic really<br/>\nsteams me.  When you constantly tell people how important CR is and they<br/>\nignore you only to die a pathetic death to a dragon, with twice as many<br/>\npeople as it would take those of us properly geared to do it, it gets very<br/>\nfrustrating.<br/>\nLet me give you an example.  Last week we went to kill Vox.  24 of us.  No<br/>\nproblem.  No deaths.  We then went on to PoH.  After about an hour there the<br/>\nserver crashed, and instead of spending the time breaking in again we<br/>\ndecided to go kill the freshly spawned Vox again.  24 of us.  No problem.  1<br/>\ndeath.  This one death was a person who arrived late and didn&#39;t have time to<br/>\nget CR buffs because we were already in her lair.  From here we were feeling<br/>\npretty confident.  Lets gate to Lavastorm and kill Nags.  It was getting<br/>\npretty late so nobody wanted to waste the time running to town to grab FR<br/>\ngear.  (We hadn&#39;t planned on doing Nags, he only respawned when the server<br/>\nwent down).<br/>\n24 people.  Little or no FR gear.  Barely killed him, more than half dead.<br/>\nNormally Nagafen presents no more problems than Vox.<br/>\nSure, maybe you&#39;ll get a lucky roll every now and then on damage.  Please do<br/>\nnot make the mistake of thinking that this means that resists are useless.  <br/>\nAnd if you think that equipping weapons and doing ~500 points of damage<br/>\nmakes a difference to a creature that has 25,000 hit points, think how much<br/>\nmore damage your party could have done if they&#39;d resisted just a little bit<br/>\nmore damage, and had just a few more attack rounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn<br/>\nThe frustrated bard of Erollisi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 05, 2000 11:13 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Nagafen 2; Sylly 0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ll agree that level does play a big part in resists.
