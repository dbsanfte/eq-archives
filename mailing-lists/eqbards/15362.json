But then I guess they<br/>\nmust view &quot;dueling down&quot; for naked run ins or making storage corpses or<br/>\nwhatever as something they dont want happening.  O rthey just dont know how<br/>\npeople play the game.  And again, they are either fixing stuff that&#39;s not<br/>\nreally broken when there is so much broken stuff un-fixed or they are<br/>\naddressing some PvP server issue by slamming their &quot;fix&quot; on everyone. If a<br/>\nsignificant number of people played PvP, it would be more justifiable but<br/>\nwith so few in PvP - why do they wreck things for everyone else?  And this<br/>\npretty much truly wrecks &quot;fun&quot; dueling in the main arena zone.  Not just for<br/>\nbards but for all mana classes.  WTF - through on full res affects too.  Sap<br/>\nall your str/agi/dex too - you deserve it for dieing!<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery week, their &quot;vision&quot; of how Norrath &quot;should be&quot; and the way that the<br/>\nvast majority of their paying customers have enjoyed playing it for the past<br/>\nnearly 12 monthes - grows further and further apart. They are losing people<br/>\nin dribs and drabs now - just wait until the &quot;bulk&quot; of the population has<br/>\ngotten all the good loots and peaked out at 50. And alot is gonna happen in<br/>\nthe next 60 days - before we see any expansion packs.  A few new zones with<br/>\nmore lizards somehow does not seem like its gonna be a solid answer to some<br/>\nvery real problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 23, 2000 3:52 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Today&#39;s patch<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Was apparently mostly server side, and didn&#39;t affect anything<br/>\n&gt; player-related except for PvP (and duel)-related deaths.
