There is no change to the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1027450740\">The chant series does 14 per tick with a drum, for three ticks, as well as<br/>\nlowering the MR, CR, or FR of the target by 25 points.  There is no change<br/>\nto the resistance debuff without an instrument, but damage drops to 8 per<br/>\ntick.  And, the very nature of the songs makes them very hard to resist in<br/>\nthe first place, much like Tashan or Malosi.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest use I can think of, is using Chant of Fire on monsters in Solusek that<br/>\nhave natural high fire resistance, so that druids and mages in your group<br/>\ncan be more effective.  And Curtailing Chant is useful all around, helping<br/>\nout your wizard, enchanter, and necro friends where ever you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as direct damage goes, DDD is pretty weak at that level.  Most<br/>\ncasters have a 44th level Direct Damage spell that does anywhere from 500 to<br/>\n600 damage for 200 to 300 hundred mana, and a 39th level AoE or Column spell<br/>\nthat does anywhere from 100 to 200 damage per pulse, to up to four targets,<br/>\nfor three pulses.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat DDD has going for it is the speed to cast it, two and a half seconds,<br/>\nand the fact that it delivers all of it&#39;s damage at once, rather than<br/>\nrequiring the target mob stay in the rain area for all three pulses most AOE<br/>\nrequires.  It&#39;s also point blank, working just like any AoE bard song, the<br/>\nfour closest mobs will be in the effect radius.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sean Kennedy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:orang@...\">orang@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 08, 1999 10:54 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Patch changes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Sean Kennedy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:orang@...\">orang@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;These are the bard specific changes in the last patch (except for /follow,<br/>\n&gt;which<br/>\n&gt;is just a huge benefit to a party with bards playing Selo&#39;s or 19)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bug fixes and newly implemented features<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- &#39;Procing&#39; (items that cast spells) weapons no longer break Bard&#39;s singing<br/>\n&gt;- We have implemented an Auto-follow command.
