Could the stats on insidious armor be looked at give higher <br/>\nac / hitpoints? Perhaps a self only AC spell be introduced at higher <br/>\nlevels to help out? Unlike other casters, Enchanters are forced to <br/>\nengage mobs that are currently not attacking them in order to be <br/>\neffective in performing their duties. With the use of charm and <br/>\nmesmerise at high levels this is even more dangerous, yet Enchanters <br/>\nget no new tools to really help in this. Even 700HP on Rune V won&#39;t <br/>\nlast more than a couple of rounds, and at a cost of 14p a cast.<br/>\n <br/>\nGZ: Actually, Bards are beat on more then any other class in the <br/>\ngame. And no - Enchanters, need a party to help keep monsters off <br/>\nthem - it is a downside to being one of the most powerful classes in <br/>\nEQ. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere you have it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
