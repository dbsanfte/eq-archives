I charm the mob (eyes<br/>\nglaze over message), give it /pet back off (get message from pet), target a<br/>\nmob, hit auto attack, then give /pet attack command (do not get a message<br/>\nfrom pet).  When I follow these steps, the mob just sits there and does<br/>\nnothing.  It helps by keeping the mob from attacking us, but I would<br/>\nobviously prefer if he attacked what I told him to.  Need someone who has<br/>\nexperience charming with the 39 charm song to tell me what you do to get<br/>\nyour pet to attack.  BTW I do not have this problem with the 27 charm song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
