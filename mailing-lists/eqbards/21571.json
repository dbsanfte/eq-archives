I&#39;ve just lifted this from everlore.com:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;When you added the patch to make it so that the / commands could not be<br/>\n&gt; used dureing inappropiate times you made it so that the /command could not<br/>\n&gt; be activated while a bard song is playing even if the ability such as<br/>\n&gt; forage<br/>\n&gt; should be ablde to be activated at that time also the new /pause command<br/>\n&gt; will not work either. while i think this command would be great for the<br/>\n&gt; bards never ending quest to fight TCS.
