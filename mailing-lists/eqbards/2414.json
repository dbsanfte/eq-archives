Maps are nice, but nothing beats just plain<br/>\nknowing the terrain and topology.  You could drop me anywhere<br/>\nin Butcherblock, North Ro, Oasis, the Commonlands, or Misty<br/>\nThicket and I would just *know* where I am, no need for a map.  <br/>\nI&#39;m almost to that point with Greater Faydark, Steamfont,<br/>\nSouth Ro, the Karanas, and Kithicor.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost everyone I meet is impressed when I tell them which trees<br/>\nor landmarks to use to set up a running vector directly from<br/>\none place to another (just hit autorun and go get something to<br/>\neat).  You don&#39;t learn this type of stuff from /loc or maps.  <br/>\nYou learn it by playing the game.  So while /loc does diminish<br/>\nthe roleplaying nature of the game, it is by no means the<br/>\nultimate in terms of in-game navigation.  I&#39;ll note that in<br/>\nthe real world, the places where GPS is most useful are out at<br/>\nsea and in the air, where landmarks are not readily available.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
