I have taken to dropping off all my<br/>\nequipment off at the bank except for a drum, food and water before<br/>\nattempting to cross. It&#39;s not so much that mob&#39;s can catch me while using<br/>\nAccelerendo, it&#39;s that people fighting in Kith are training all sorts of<br/>\nnasties to the entrances/exits and then hopping zones to saftey. I&#39;ve almost<br/>\ndied twice now in situations where I made it through the forest without a<br/>\nproblem only to run into 3-4 undead uber-mobs waiting at the zone exit to<br/>\nHighhold or Rivervale.<br/>\n<br/>\nFun Fun Fun<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only saving grace I can see is that a lot of the high level group gate<br/>\ncapable people on Mith Marr are now much friendlier about giving free rides<br/>\nacross the world :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: JasonF &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eqbards@...\">Eqbards@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 9:46 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Infected Paw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This rambles a bit, but I ain&#39;t had no coffee so bear with me:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, so Infected Paw is being upgraded.  Hell we all complained that IP was<br/>\n&gt; too far from bind points for its designated level to be very useful, so<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; high time for a revamp there.  I&#39;m concerned, however.  Not so much about<br/>\nIP<br/>\n&gt; being upgraded as the general trend that we&#39;re seeing to make existing<br/>\nzones<br/>\n&gt; more and more difficult as the mean player base gains in level.  Kithicor,<br/>\n&gt; for instance, has been raised to the point where level 50s can&#39;t be<br/>\nassured<br/>\n&gt; of traveling through the zone without dying.  From what I hear Qeynos<br/>\nHills<br/>\n&gt; now spawns high 20s undead such as Skeletal Monks that will make quick<br/>\nwork<br/>\n&gt; out of anyone traveling to/from Qeynos and Blackburrow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night I met up with a friend who had just purchased and installed<br/>\n&gt; EverQuest.  He started a warrior in Qeynos.  I&#39;m teaching an experienced<br/>\n&gt; gamer, but complete EQ newbie things like &quot;don&#39;t kill wolves and bears<br/>\nnear<br/>\n&gt; Holly and Cros Treewind&quot;, &quot;/con everything&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t be afraid to run&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;monsters can&#39;t follow you through zones&quot;, dmg/atk ratios, what is AC,<br/>\netc.,<br/>\n&gt; etc.  I&#39;m not big on twinking so I didn&#39;t give him much.  A fine steel<br/>\nsword<br/>\n&gt; and 20pp for milk and muffins.  But is Qeynos Hills going to kick his ass?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What about Enchanters born on the East side of the world from Kithicor?<br/>\n&gt; Their level 8 animation spell in in High Keep, as are bards level 16 songs<br/>\n&gt; (some better because of Selo&#39;s, granted).  At level 8 a true EQ newbie has<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; very difficult time just finding out that his spell is *in* High Keep and<br/>\n&gt; then making his way from Ak&#39;Anon or Freeport.  My god, now the obvious<br/>\nroute<br/>\n&gt; takes him through Kithicor.  He might never have ever seen anything more<br/>\n&gt; aggresive than a Young Kodiak or the odd Hill Giant.  The sad thing is<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; the Hill Giants that he&#39;s seen are *considerably* easier to kill than any<br/>\n&gt; undead that he&#39;s going to run into in Kithicor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I suppose what I&#39;m saying is that Verant is increasing the difficulty by<br/>\n&gt; leaps and bounds of *existing* zones in order to compensate for the high<br/>\n&gt; level player base.  This is detrimental to the true EQ newbies.  If *I*<br/>\n&gt; started a Gnome Enchanter right now, I&#39;d know that I could invis (lvl 4<br/>\n&gt; spell for them) and travel the boat to Freeport, EC, NRo, Oasis, SRo,<br/>\n&gt; Innothule, Feerrott, Rathe Mts, SK, NK, WK, HH, HK if I really wanted to<br/>\n&gt; avoid Kithicor.  OR get a high level escort during the day and save a<br/>\nbunch<br/>\n&gt; of time and zoning.  But a real newbie has no idea of what awaits him when<br/>\n&gt; he zones from the tranquil WC in to Kith.  Mayhem, madness and swift death<br/>\n&gt; and exp. loss.  What would *you* do if you had no friends in EQ and got<br/>\n&gt; killed with one spell by an Undead Cleric somewhere between WC and the<br/>\n&gt; Rivervale entrance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most people on this list are experienced players.  Some of us are *very*<br/>\n&gt; experienced players.  If we started new characters, even completely<br/>\n&gt; untwinked, we would be able to avoid these things because we know the game<br/>\n&gt; *so* well.  We take the depth of our knowledge for granted.  I remember<br/>\nback<br/>\n&gt; in late May when I first install EQ - do you remember when you first<br/>\n&gt; installed it?  Remember how completely freakin&#39; lost you were?  Now put<br/>\n&gt; Kithicor between you and something that you need as much as a level 8<br/>\n&gt; enchanters needs Mircyl&#39;s Animation.  Say you&#39;re a level 6 bard in<br/>\nFreeport<br/>\n&gt; and hear &quot;Are you [interested] in delivering [mail]?&quot;, &quot;We need [mail]<br/>\n&gt; delivered to [High Keep].
