Shadowbane I believe is very close.<br/>\nLord of the Rings is far from - if it will ever - be released.  The company<br/>\nthat holds the long term development (I think it&#39;s Sierra owned by EA) has<br/>\nwasted three years. - laying off the entire development team and trying to<br/>\nstart again.<br/>\nHorizons showed a lot of promise - but the management of the company was<br/>\ncompletely incompetent - and their best developers quit in frustration.<br/>\nThey went bankrupt and were bought by NCSoft that will hopefully have a good<br/>\nproduct some time in the future.  They have been pretty tight lipped - but<br/>\nevidently are concentrating on developing the engine.<br/>\nNCSoft produces the largest MMORPG in the world.  In typical American<br/>\narrogance - we talk about EQ being the biggest because we only look at our<br/>\nmarket But their BloodPledge game has 2.7 million subscribers.  That&#39;s not a<br/>\ntypo or a mistake.  Those are almost all in Asia and they only recently<br/>\nstarted marketing in the US market.  They hired Richard Garriot who&#39;s<br/>\nheading up the US arm of the company.<br/>\nThe upcoming 200-pound gorilla of the MMORPG market will also be released by<br/>\nVerant - sometime this year.  You may have heard of it - it&#39;s called Star<br/>\nWars Galaxies<br/>\n\tSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Anyway, have you heard of the TWO persistent world (massive multiplayer)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lord<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;of the Rings games which&#39;re supposed to come out soon?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;And is this (leaving for Anarchy Online or others) why EQ users seem to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;vanished over the course of the last year or so? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
