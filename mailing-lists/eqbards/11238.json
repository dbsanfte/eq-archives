There was a Cleric sit-in on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;last night of about 50 or so level 1 clerics.  I can assure you *everyone*<br/>\n&gt;in the zone was very angry with these clerics.  They were lagging the zone<br/>\n&gt;horribly and spamming the zone (intentionally and unintentionally) with<br/>\n&gt;shouts and ooc.  If we want to make a point with Verant, we need to try and<br/>\n&gt;find a way to do so that doesn&#39;t penalize other players&#39; game experience.<br/>\n&gt;Verant won&#39;t sit still for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;re Bards, right?<br/>\nSo.... who&#39;s up to a little composition?
