I bring my <br/>\n49th Rogue to raids. At least half of the people involved in our raids are <br/>\n&lt;53 secondary characters. We almost always have 53+ <br/>\nclerics/shamans/enchanters present to buff us, though, and I usually bring <br/>\nthe bard for pumping mana into the buffing team. You can also use the scales <br/>\nfrom Ragefire if you have any clerics working on their epic quest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;My guild can&#39;t do Vox or Naggy straight up because almost all of us are <br/>\n&gt;above level 52.  I&#39;m curious if<br/>\n&gt;anyone can give me some guidance on how level 53+ characters can contribute <br/>\n&gt;to a Vox/Naggy raid without<br/>\n&gt;being tossed (or with being tossed, if that&#39;s useful).  I don&#39;t understand <br/>\n&gt;the mechanics of when someone<br/>\n&gt;is tossed and when they aren&#39;t.  We have a couple of small guild allies <br/>\n&gt;that we could use as front men.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, does anyone have links to any good information on taking down the <br/>\n&gt;Kunark dragons?  We haven&#39;t done<br/>\n&gt;any of them yet; everyone keeps saying we have too few high levels (50 over <br/>\n&gt;level 53 doesn&#39;t seem that<br/>\n&gt;weak to me, but what do I know?  We have about 5 level 60s now.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m never getting this epic weapon, we have too many warriors, and two <br/>\n&gt;Bards in front of me.  But it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;nice to dream.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
