To me, it looks as if the animatioon for the silly <br/>\nwaddle and the arm waving are trying to go off at the same time, resulting <br/>\nin my character leaning hard to one side sometimes or waddling erratically. <br/>\nIs it just me?<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally went to my first plane Sunday. We went to Hate, overall had a <br/>\ngreat time. We had around 35 players from at least 3 guilds but it went very <br/>\nwell due to a very experienced leader and pull team. I was the Only bard <br/>\nthere all day. Died 4 times but got rezzed back fast (all those clerics are <br/>\nclarity addicts hehe). I got the Martune rapier, imbrued boots, and BP. The <br/>\nMaestro went down easy, only dropped a monk mask. Innoruk however cleaned <br/>\nall our clocks handily! So now I have on silvery legs and hero bracer since <br/>\nmy groups decided the lambent blue clashed with the imbrued. I really need <br/>\nto find those singing steel gloves now!<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
