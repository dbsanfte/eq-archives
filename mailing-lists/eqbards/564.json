The ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2008671042\">I pointed out to the GM that Meldrath was casting Charm through walls without<br/>\never having clear line of sight to me and told him I thought it was a bug.  The<br/>\nGM told me that it is NOT a bug and that there is nothing that can be done for a<br/>\nplayer in this circumstance.  Anyway, I have not found the GM&#39;s to be too helpful<br/>\nand while it sucked for me at the time, I am more glad that they are not passing<br/>\nout favors and goodies to every person that can think up a good story.  Too many<br/>\npeople would abuse it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRodney Morris wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Rodney Morris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rodmorris@...\">rodmorris@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Roop Dirump wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; FYI, any monster casting a spell or charming through a wall is considered a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bug!

But be<br/>\n&gt; warned - after losing my corpse due to a game bug, I petitioned, and<br/>\n&gt; a week and a day later I finally was contacted by a GM.  Actually,<br/>\n&gt; that is not true - a friend of mine contacted a GM, as he is on for<br/>\n&gt; at least double the amount of time that I am.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And if you are not contacted by the GM before your corpse decays,<br/>\n&gt; then it is GONE!  No they can not, or maybe will not reimburse you<br/>\n&gt; for items you were carrying.  Mino axe?  gone.  Magic armour? gone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course, you may be lucky and play during &#39;peak&#39; times, when the<br/>\n&gt; concentration of GMs is likely to be higher.
