We had 19 people in the<br/>\nraid.  There wasn&#39;t any enchanters in the raid and only one other bard.  So once<br/>\nagain, even though I was the lowest level player in the raid, everyone was glad<br/>\nto have me around for clarity, stamina and resist songs.<br/>\nAfter we got all the groups organized, we moved down to the shark room (I think<br/>\nthats what its called), we killed whatever shark drops a shark tooth(5/18<br/>\npiercer). I got lucky and won the roll (around 10 people rolled for the item).<br/>\nThis was a better weapon than what I was currently wielding (thulian claws and<br/>\nobsidian shard). After we cleaned out that area we moved on to another area to<br/>\nprepare for the attack on Estrella. On the way, we killed a golden hair mermaid.<br/>\nNone of the rangers present needed the mermaid hair for the Raincaller quest so<br/>\nI was given permission to loot the hair. I can now complete the Mane Attraction<br/>\n(+10 charisma toupee, nice item for bards) quest. <br/>\nWe then decided to pull Estrella.  The raid leader warned everyone that Estrella<br/>\ncould dispell everyone&#39;s Enduring Breath buffs so be prepared.  I told my group<br/>\nI would have ER and GR weaved to help prevent that from happening to us.  The<br/>\nmain puller told everyone to focus on killing Estrella first and then whatever<br/>\nelse got pulled.  I should have paid better attention at that point but I was<br/>\ncaught up in the moment and did not consider the ramifications of what he said.<br/>\nI started weaving ER and GR as soon as the puller yelled INC.  When Estrella got<br/>\npulled, four gloomwater mermaids came with her.  Because everyone was focused on<br/>\nEstrella, I quickly moved up the hate list for the other four mermaids.  I ended<br/>\nup dying in less than 5 seconds due to the bard hate factor.  I died so fast the<br/>\ncleric in my group didn&#39;t even have time to target me for a heal.  I felt kinda<br/>\nbad because I was the only person who ended up dying but it wasn&#39;t a big deal<br/>\ncoz I got an EXP res. In hindsight, it would have been smarter if some of the<br/>\ntanks meleed the mermaids to get their attention.  Or perhaps I shouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nstarted to weave ER and GR until after the battle started.    <br/>\nThe raid turned sour at that point because someone ninja looted a Rod of Drones<br/>\nfrom Estrella.  We were planning on moving on to Phingiel but a lot of people<br/>\nwere pissed and left.  We ended up moving back towards the entrance and tried to<br/>\npull Bubble with the 9 people who decided to stay.  When we discovered that<br/>\nBubble hadn&#39;t spawned, most everyone decided to split. <br/>\nOn the way out, I got lost and ended up dieing when a bunch of stuff attacked<br/>\nme. Someone was able to pull my corpse to the zone and I got another EXP a res.<br/>\nAfter that, me, a 38 ranger and a 45 warrior decided to pull stuff to the zone.<br/>\nA few minutes later a 35 mage showed up and we added him.  The warrior pulled a<br/>\nfierce impaler (rare spawn near the zone) so we zoned to avoid anymore deaths.<br/>\nWe tried to recruit people in Dagnor&#39;s to help us kill the impaler but no one<br/>\nwould come. The ranger decided to call it a night. A few minutes later the<br/>\ncleric who was originally in my group logged back in and heard us recruiting. He<br/>\nagreed to help us and so we went back in. Thanks largely to the cleric&#39;s<br/>\nRetributions, we were able to kill the fierce impaler. The group leader<br/>\n/randomed 1000 to determine the range for everyone to roll for the loot. He came<br/>\nup with 483. I did a /random 1 483 and almost shit my britches when I rolled a<br/>\n483 on the nose. Everyone in the party said they had never seen that happen<br/>\nbefore using that looting method. I am now the proud owner of a Gloomwater<br/>\nharpoon (piercer, 9/31 +4STR, +25HP, only 3lbs), far and away the best weapon<br/>\nI&#39;ve ever had. <br/>\nSo this weekend in Kedge I was the luckiest bard on E&#39;ci. I was the only person<br/>\nin the raid who died(twice) but I came out of the raid with two weapons better<br/>\nthan the ones I went in with. Two deaths:two great weapons...poetic justice,<br/>\nkizmet, coincidence or whatever, I&#39;ll take it :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a 32+ bard and want to try something new, I strongly encourage you to<br/>\ngive Kedge a try.  Your presense will be greatly appreciated.  Its one helluva<br/>\nzone as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n34 bard<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I made 34th level while in Kedge as well.  That was icing on the cake:-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
