My <br/>\nfriend and I went to the 3rd level and proceeded to kill everything that <br/>\nspawned for 5 hours.  No Babbinsbort.  I had to log then, but my friend <br/>\nstayed 10 (10! that is 15 hours in all) more hours and STILL NO GNOME.  No <br/>\nplaceholders were left standing, no triggers left unkilled, but no spawn.  <br/>\nThe problem is, simply, you must sometimes kill the placeholders 20 or 40 <br/>\ntimes to get the rare spawn (love that random number generator). No exp, <br/>\ntedious as all hell, and no reward after all that camping except for a <br/>\nhandful of plat.  We were both left with a vile taste in our mouths from <br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be the first to agree (and to counsel my clerical friends) that the <br/>\nquests are strictly optional, and nobody *needs* the quest armor. If you <br/>\ncan&#39;t stand the camping, don&#39;t. Having said that, these must be the <br/>\nworst-designed quests I have seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\nwho is VERY happy not to be a cleric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
