I laughed in his face.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Then I explained to him how MAGES should work: Stated I actually hated<br/>\n&gt;waiting around for five minutes as he recharged after every skirmish with a<br/>\n&gt;gnoll pup, so he shouldn&#39;t do anything at all--nada / zilch / stand there<br/>\n&gt;stiff / do nothing--except in dire emergencies!  Told him a mage<br/>\n&gt;should--never--cast spells (except for a pet), until that rare time the<br/>\n&gt;battle is turning for the worse.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This IS good advice.  Not only that, it will keep the creatures from<br/>\nfrenzying on the mage and ignoring the fighters.  Seen a lot of fights go<br/>\nbad like that.  People don&#39;t understand that, yeah, maybe our buffs aren&#39;t<br/>\nall super awesome like the clerics, but they are FREE and they affect<br/>\nEVERYONE.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Keep this in mind: it&#39;s your character, not the leader&#39;s.  Personally, if I<br/>\n&gt;find myself in a group with a bad &quot;general,&quot; I either disobey (and see how<br/>\n&gt;he reacts) and/or leave.

Keyeon, my bard, is an exteremely arrogant and<br/>\noverconfident guy.
