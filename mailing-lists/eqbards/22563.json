I had already loaded dx7a a few<br/>\nmonths ago, plus loaded new video<br/>\nand sound drivers, so I thought I would be OK.  But after installing the<br/>\npatch last night, I couldn&#39;t run<br/>\nEQ at all since it couldn&#39;t detect my 3D card.  So I loaded new video<br/>\ndriver.  Then I was getting all of<br/>\nthe following:  1)  5 minutes to zone, 2) one minute to regain control of my<br/>\ncharacter after zoning, 3)<br/>\n3-10 second pauses roughly 3 times a minute while attempting to play, 4)<br/>\nconstant disk access.  I loaded<br/>\nnew sound drivers, that didn&#39;t help.  What made it tolerable (although I<br/>\nstill get pauses) was to run<br/>\nDXDIAG and set the sound acceleration slider off.  (I don&#39;t play with sound<br/>\nanyway, so I don&#39;t much<br/>\ncare).  This improved the zoning, and gives me 3 or so 1-3 second pauses<br/>\neach minute, which still stinks,<br/>\nbut at least it&#39;s playable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo turn down (or turn off) sound acceleration.  Especially if you have an SB<br/>\nsound card, they seem to be<br/>\nthe big culprit.  Then hope they fix this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m running on a rather minimal system, and I think I need to break down and<br/>\nbuy some more memory, also (I<br/>\nonly have 64).  Is anyone running problem-free with that little?<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel Sniderman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyone else experience this - judging by postings on the tech boards -<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are quite a few others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Post-patch I get 1.5 second pauses every 5-10 seconds or so.
