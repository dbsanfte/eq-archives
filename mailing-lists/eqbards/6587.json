They ended up zoning to escape dying a<br/>\nsecond time.  Because it was easy for me to retrieve my corpse (near<br/>\nRunnyeye zone), I ended up trying (and dying) a second time to get their<br/>\ncorpses.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, the main reason I died the first time is because I had a DOT cast on<br/>\nme.  As I was running to the zone, my health dropped low enough to slow me<br/>\ndown.  I was weaving Selos, Hymn, and the 22d level song (and even equipped<br/>\nlute while running) .  Sure would have been nice if the 22d song had gotten<br/>\nrid of the DOTs because I probably would have survived.    <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Also, if you made it to 5 feet from the border, how come the other guys<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t get to their<br/>\n&gt; corpses? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
