At level 40, as I said before...  I can&#39;t outrun<br/>\ntwo things in the world:  Bards higher level than me, and <br/>\nanything with Spirit of Norrath (shadowmen).<br/>\n<br/>\nHell, I can even outrun GrimFeather in North Karana.  And he<br/>\nflies faster than SoC.  Bards over level 38 with MM drums are <br/>\nthe only classes in the entire game that can escape him, based<br/>\non speed alone.  At level 36 or 37, GrimFeather will catch you<br/>\nif you try to flee.
