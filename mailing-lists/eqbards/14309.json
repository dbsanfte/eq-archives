My friends and I have been planning to test that very<br/>\nassertion.  We wanted to make a group of Bard, Warrior, Ranger, and 3<br/>\nPaladins (pallies get better heals plus Lay Hands).  We felt with 6 melee<br/>\ntypes, we could really do some serious damage.  We would have had a great<br/>\ntime thru the lower levels, but I could see possible problems at higher<br/>\nlevels.  By selectively taunting and backing out of combat, we could have<br/>\nspread the damage around quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
