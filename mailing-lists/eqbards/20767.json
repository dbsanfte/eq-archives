Hunt the zone in Kedge.<br/>\nBest xp zone multiplier in the game, lancers stay blue till 40th level. My<br/>\nranger character went from 35 through 42 within a few weeks of light game<br/>\nplay there. My bard is just waiting for the chance to use it to level up but<br/>\nthat&#39;s a ways off. Single pull the lancers and kill them in the entryway,<br/>\nfish don&#39;t run so no snare/chains are needed. Don&#39;t charm in that entryway,<br/>\nthe fish warps to the 2nd level as it enters guard mode and generally comes<br/>\nback with 3-4 friends, believe it, I&#39;ve seen it. If your group is 37 average<br/>\nyou should be able to take the piercer and impalier with some effort but I<br/>\nknow a 30ish group of 4 friends that just took out an impaler so a group<br/>\naround 37 should do fine. If you are lucky the Fierce Impaler will spawn,<br/>\nit&#39;s your only chance at loot on the upper level, common drop Gloomwater<br/>\nHarpoon (DMG: 9 Atk Delay: 31 +4 STR, +25 HP bards can use), rare is Darksea<br/>\nHarpoon (DMG: 10 Atk Delay: 28 +5 WIS, +5 STR, +20 MANA +5 DR shaman only).<br/>\nThe Darksea is worth on the order of 8-10kpp, the gloomwater is nice as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure you mem Jig of vigor, as well as Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre. The stamina<br/>\neffect is very important since you won&#39;t get anything back underwater. Don&#39;t<br/>\ndepend on Tarew&#39;s for Enduring Breath, it&#39;s range isn&#39;t great, but if things<br/>\nget out of synch or breath runs out during battle it starts up quick and<br/>\nwill save lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderbrush<br/>\n43rd level ranger of Tunare<br/>\nReedwind<br/>\n17th level bard - &quot;Come on Under, let me play some!&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
