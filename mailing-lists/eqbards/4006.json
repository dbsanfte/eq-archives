I also got sneak!  how does that work?  makes you kinda invisible?  or<br/>\n&gt;changes attitude of monster? someone said you can play songs and sneak -<br/>\n&gt;what about run? can you run and sneak?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sneak seems to effect the radius at which mobs notice you, or more likely<br/>\njust lets you come up behind them without them seeing you (rogues use it for<br/>\nbackstabbing).  My rogue friend, however, told me that it now functions<br/>\nsimilar to invisibility on the test server.  Use the skill a few levels<br/>\nthere, until it becomes obsolete by a song.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
