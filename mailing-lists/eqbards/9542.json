You can travel through the mountains. Second a little hardship<br/>\nisn&#39;t going to kill you or any other newbies. If worst comes to worst just<br/>\ntravel through Rathe Mountains like all the evil melee class do. Newbies no<br/>\nlonger have to dodge griffins or hill giants because us high levels hunt<br/>\nthem constantly. Newbies have an easier economy to work with then we did.<br/>\nNot only that but newbies also get the occasional teleport or sow. Teleport<br/>\nwas unheard of when we were newbies sow was as rare as teleport back then.<br/>\nThere are ways around it your just going to have to stick it through.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, November 01, 1999 7:30 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Undead drops in Kithicor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I see from the board that many of you are upset that the undead spawns in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kithicor were<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;stopped.

Kithicor is, at one and the same time, a newbie zone AND a zone that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you MUST<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;travel through in order to get from the four eastern cities to RV, and that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;much prefer to use to get from RV to High Keep.  Note that the alternate<br/>\n </span></blockquote>route to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;HK/Qeynos/Halas from RV takes you through Runnyeye and Beholder, hardly<br/>\n </span></blockquote>safe zones<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;below level 20 or so, and takes a LOT longer to HK.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2.  The fact that these spawn only appeared at night is not a help.  In<br/>\n </span></blockquote>order to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;traverse the zone safely, this would require you to wait until dawn each<br/>\n </span></blockquote>time you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;wanted to get through the zone (unless you were sufficiently high level<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that it didn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;matter, see point 3).  If you thought waiting for the boat was<br/>\n </span></blockquote>irritating...   This is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;NOT a good use of playing time.  Plus, although the spawn did not appear<br/>\n </span></blockquote>during the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;daytime, I am not convinced that they actually evaporated at dawn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3.
