Running around the bowl can be exciting with five giants chasing you but it will get mind numbingly boring after a while.  <br/>\nAlso, if you follow the path back to DL for a very short ways, there is a clearing to the left that is free of roamers (I call it my &#39;glade of death&#39;) and you can chant/sharm kite mobs in there.  Wurms and bees should likely be avoided because of their high FR.  The other two chants work well there and you might want to partner with a root class there, things go very fast that way.  <br/>\n  Christopher Sanders &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christopher.sanders@...\">christopher.sanders@...</a>&gt; wrote: Hmmm...what did you hunt, and what was your technique in Burning Woods?<br/>\nI&#39;ve avoided it, because Chant of Flame doesn&#39;t stick on much of anything in<br/>\nthere, and it&#39;s way easy to aggro wurms and hornets.

I grouped at orc hill from 4-7 and then went to Crushbone until 10.<br/>\nFrom there I went to the commons (soloed a bit in butcherblock first tho) --<br/>\nkilled orcs in the commons till 12, then I did Dervs in the west commons<br/>\ntill 15 -- lake Rathetear until 18 -- East Karana to 19 then lake of ill<br/>\nomen till 30 (The front of the goblin fort is great with lament to pull,<br/>\n/bellows to soften them up and then all instrument twist).   Spent some time<br/>\nin Rathe Mtns after that learning to charm kite and then Dalnir&#39;s crypt<br/>\nuntil 33 or 34, Overthere until 36 and then EW where I soloed from 38 to 49<br/>\nthere.
