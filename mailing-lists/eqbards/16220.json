There are other classes I would far prefer<br/>\nover a necro (Enchanter, Bard, a good tank, Cleric)  If I had a group and<br/>\nneeded a 6th and a necro came up, I&#39;d take him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, full group vs full group There are many classes I would prefer over a<br/>\nnecro.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying they aren&#39;t _good_ in a group.  I&#39;m saying there are other<br/>\nclasses that are far more efficient in a group and more advantageous.  David<br/>\nposted some VERY good points that I agree with 100% regarding this<br/>\ndiscussion.  Bottom line:  Necro&#39;s aren&#39;t as good in a group as they are<br/>\nsolo.  But they are still &quot;ok&quot; in a group though there are other classes I<br/>\nwould highly prefer over one if given the choice in a _full_ group.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is what I&#39;ve been stating all along.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 15, 2000 3:58 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] RE: Class balance (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kevin L.

A good group will kill things<br/>\n&gt; &gt;far faster than a necro can solo thus his &quot;real&quot; damage never gets<br/>\nstarted.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Necro&#39;s are very weak in groups because there&#39;s no time for their DoT&#39;s<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ramp up in dmg.  Typically it takes a full minute or more for a Necro DOT<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;realize full potential in dmg.  Most fights with a good group last far<br/>\nless<br/>\n&gt; &gt;than that (unless you&#39;re talking dragons/planes).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I totally disagree.  If the group of 5 can handle mob X and you add a<br/>\nnecro<br/>\n&gt; who can solo mob Y, the necro can effectively fight mob Y separately while<br/>\n&gt; you kill Mob X a couple of times adding to the xp of all.  For most<br/>\nclasses<br/>\n&gt; Mob Y in this example would be half the level of Mob X, for the Necro Mob<br/>\nY<br/>\n&gt; is 2-5 levels below Mob X at most.  Adding a Necro wisely can nearly<br/>\ndouble<br/>\n&gt; the xp if the mobs are available.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; DON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
