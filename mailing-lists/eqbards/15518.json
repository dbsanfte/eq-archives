Some k3wld00ds attacked him, and he slapped them <br/>\naway.  He had the elf slave with him (who, it turns out, was a bard) and <br/>\nLord Whatshisname (Garamond?).  Well, some preadolescent killed the slave, <br/>\nwho was not invulnerable, and was an integral part of the storyline.  After <br/>\nthat things went downhill.<br/>\n<br/>\nMayong stood there for 10 minutes, not moving or saying anything.  Feeling <br/>\nfull of spunk, and noticing that the event had stalled, I walked up to him, <br/>\n/poked him in the chest, and asked him why he crawled out of his hole after <br/>\nall this time hiding like the craven worm he is.  He replied with something <br/>\nalong the lines of &quot;Fear me, child.  I can bring you a fate far worse than <br/>\ndeath.&quot;  I told him he would never understand the valor of good races, and <br/>\nsaid I did not fear death, which was in truth all he had to show.  He paused <br/>\ndramatically, then killed me. = )<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, anyways, after that he went on a rampage, gravity fluxing and pointing <br/>\nthe Finger of Doom at everyone around.  When the dust settled, he was gone.  <br/>\nHis assistant, Khasra, led us to the graveyard entry, where she tried to <br/>\ntell us the remaining storyline.  A few loudmouthed idiots kept chattering, <br/>\nand some folks kept attacking her (and disappearing) until finally she got <br/>\nfed up and left for Neriak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard secondhand that Lanys T&#39;vil met with Mayong there, and took a vial <br/>\nof his blood to use in some arcane ritual.  Sadly, nobody I spoke to was <br/>\nquite sure of the nature of the ritual, only that it involved Veeshan&#39;s Veil <br/>\nsomehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis had the potential to be a great event, but people were bound and <br/>\ndetermined to attack every NPC in sight.  Visions of k3wl l00t obscured the <br/>\ndramatic potential of the affair, and only a few people were interested in <br/>\nroleplaying or learning anything.  This was obviously part of a long <br/>\nevolving storyline, and exactly the kind of event I always wanted to see... <br/>\nor it could have been, anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
