Now I&#39;ll have to watch what I say<br/>\nto my Shaman friend when I pass him by during the next few levels. It may<br/>\ncome back to haunt me!

My guild &lt;Fervir&gt; had an event vs.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Nox Aeris&gt; today on the Innoruk Server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basically the two guilds went to war and then we chose a person to race<br/>\n&gt; from the Arena in Lake Rathe to West Freeport.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got nominated, 22nd Level Bard(go figure), and Nox Aeris put up a 24th<br/>\n&gt; level Shaman. (little did i know 24 is the level where you get Spirit of<br/>\n&gt; Cheetah)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So we take off, and it is a tie at the Rathe Mountain zone. Both our<br/>\n&gt; guilds have ambushes set up along the way (i planned to twist Rhythyms<br/>\n&gt; when i got in trouble to up my magic resist). Then the Shaman pulls<br/>\n&gt; ahead of me for a second... but then he has to stop and cast SoC again<br/>\n&gt; (i have heard it lasts 30 seconds). I catch up to him, and pass him,<br/>\n&gt; then he passes me again... then has to stop to cast again... and i pass<br/>\n&gt; him and never see him again. i got a report at South Ro, that he was<br/>\n&gt; right behind me (that was where our ambush was set. Both sets of<br/>\n&gt; ambushers (ours and theirs) said &quot;i saw him for a second, but could not<br/>\n&gt; target him, much less cast a spell&quot;).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the time I entered West freeport, the shaman had just zoned into into<br/>\n&gt; East commons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So my guild won, thanks to the bard speed. It was quite a shock to the<br/>\n&gt; other guild since I strutted around like a warrior with my PGT and BLW<br/>\n&gt; all morning, just for their benefit, only breaking out my drum and song<br/>\n&gt; when they said &quot;GO&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
