(I can&#39;t stress this enough)  DO NOT stand in line of sight with<br/>\nthe fortress entrance and sing Hymn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what happened in the past couple of days, but when I stand on<br/>\nthe slope a little ways from the entrance and sing Hymn, we start to get<br/>\nfaction hits from other groups and Giants come running out to come pound on<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nI proved it to my group yesterday.  A Giant popped in the doorway.  We were<br/>\nour usual safe distance away from the fort.  The group were all sitting<br/>\nmedding and healing.  I started Hymn for ONE pulse, and the Tump came<br/>\nbounding out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally I speed in to the fort to pull.  Now I don&#39;t even have to move!<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on, however, I was with a group to the right side of the entrance,<br/>\nbeside the flagpole.  The spot we chose was actually closer than the slope<br/>\nearlier, yet I could Hymn away to my heart&#39;s content without aggroing a<br/>\nsingle mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKyrisha</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
