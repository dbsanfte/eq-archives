You guys were right after lvl 17 things do move faster.  The tips on getting a lighter faster weapon has been a lifesaver.  I hated it but i traded in my mino axe.  (hehe, i liked so much seeing that 17 points of damage scroll across the screen)  However in the long run the change has paid off.  Thanks Again for all your help..<br/>\n<br/>\nNow i have another question.  I&#39;m interested in joining a good guild, emphasis on the good.  A bard guild would be nice or a guild that is very active on my server, which is by the way Innoruk.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Again<br/>\n<br/>\nSing it Loud and Proud Bards<br/>\n<br/>\nHumility LVL 17 (HURRY)  Innorruk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
