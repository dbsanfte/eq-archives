Also I found the belt quest in Kaladim semi satisfying since <br/>\n&gt;I can drum run towards Kaladim and take those worthless belts to make 1 gp <br/>\n&gt;from gems or bandages and such which isn&#39;t too bad.  Bards near Kelethin may <br/>\n&gt;want to check into this to boast their funds also since we got it rough both <br/>\n&gt;ways.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bryne<br/>\n&gt;10th circle<br/>\n&gt;Songweaver<br/>\n&gt;Bertoxx Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
