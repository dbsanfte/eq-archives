Now it seems every time I get near a<br/>\nplace like Freeport or Kelethin - it&#39;s non-stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I find it especially interesting that most are Level 1.  This shows two<br/>\nthings.  They haven&#39;t even bothered to try to play the game (i.e. how long<br/>\ndoes it REALLY take to level to 2) - and they haven&#39;t done any research<br/>\n(i.e. 30 minute corpse decay prior to level 6).  I started last March and<br/>\nhad no help; and was quite surprised that unlike some other MUD type games<br/>\nI&#39;ve played - it really WAS unnecessary to get handouts to get your<br/>\ncharacter going.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I also had an interesting case of a guy level 12 or so who claimed he<br/>\n&quot;lost his corpse&quot;.  This WAS a bard - so I don&#39;t see how he could have lost<br/>\nthe corpse.  I would have considered helping him (perhaps he fell asleep or<br/>\nsomething) - but with a character name of &quot;Pimpicious&quot; or some such - I<br/>\ndecided not to bother...<br/>\n<br/>\n    The worst thing about it - is these people have no clue.  I had a guy<br/>\n(who wasn&#39;t completely new to EQ - but relatively new) get introduced to me<br/>\nas a friend of some guildmates starting out a bard character.  He asked me a<br/>\nlot of good, intelligent questions.  Not once did he ask me for anything but<br/>\ninformation.  I have a bunch of crappy old stuff (to me) that I gladly gave<br/>\nhim at level 8.  Were talking banded or slightly better type stuff.  I told<br/>\nhim simply to pass it along to another starting bard when he levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;ve had some other cases over the past several months where I&#39;ve given<br/>\naway stuff I&#39;ve outgrown to &quot;young&quot; Bards.  But first of all - only people<br/>\nwho&#39;ve spent enough time to get to at least level 7-9; and that they don&#39;t<br/>\nbeg - they try to get to know me and wait for me to offer...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde 35 - Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
