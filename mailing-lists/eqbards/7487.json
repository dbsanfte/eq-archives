Reduces the game to an arcade game.  wait that&#39;s<br/>\nwhy I don&#39;t play Quake, Diablo, etc.  I want a death penalty.  But losing an<br/>\nentire night of playing, not just its gains mind you but a sizeable chunk of<br/>\nthe actual playing time, is too harsh.  especially when its just because you<br/>\nhad the misfortune to zone into a 4 griffene train on the bridge in N<br/>\nkarana.  My game play two nights ago was literally.  Awake in east Karana.<br/>\nZone into N Karana.  Never even appear there, just zoned for 6 minutes.<br/>\nAppeared in Halas.  Run to N Karana to get my body whcih had both my drums<br/>\non it since I was doing corpse retrieval at the time anyhow.  Run to Qeynos,<br/>\nmy original destination.  Camp.  Wow, that was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t disagree with you too often Michael, you hae a good perspective on<br/>\nmost things I think.  On this though i think you are missing the real<br/>\npenalty a lot of us pay for dying.  Death = no playing.  This rule applies<br/>\nto 90% of the people I personally know who play during at least 50% of their<br/>\nplaying sessions.  That&#39;s proabably a defining reason why only one person I<br/>\npersonally know is over 24th level.  He made 30 while on a two week vacation<br/>\nwith a broken leg.  He is still at 30 and hating his &#39;Hell&#39; level big time<br/>\nnow that he can&#39;t play any more than the rest of us and can&#39;t group with us.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 5:38 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;ve never played, but i heard in quake 2 if you die you respawn right away<br/>\nin the same area and can start killing again with absolutely no downtime or<br/>\nzoning.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada =P<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Still I can&#39;t figure out why people think <br/>\n&gt; running naked<br/>\n&gt; accross the world to you body is more fun than regaining exp <br/>\n&gt; you had fun<br/>\n&gt; getting the first time just so you don&#39;t get set back in some <br/>\n&gt; bizarre got to<br/>\n&gt; get to the next level plan.
