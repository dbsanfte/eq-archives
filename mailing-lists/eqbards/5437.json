I have been on vacation.<br/>\n&gt;I hate checking my mail on vacation.  I like playing EQ tho.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Topic was why did Harmonic chide Sylly for 50pp and Estella<br/>\n&gt;for 75pp for elfhide gloves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) When you are level 19 (which I was) you don&#39;t just throw<br/>\n&gt;   out 50pp or more on something like that.  Hell, you are<br/>\n&gt;   lucky to make 25pp on a hard working night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) People who claim that plat is worthless, and that making<br/>\n&gt;   a couple hundred pp is no big deal are full of it.  That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   that traditional level 35+ person talking.  Refer to earlier<br/>\n&gt;   comment on my level at the time.  You don&#39;t make that much<br/>\n&gt;   money if you are a lower level adventurer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3) I&#39;ve seen those gloves sell for 35pp to 45pp, in fact people<br/>\n&gt;   are willing to hand those gloves out at no cost sometimes!<br/>\n&gt;   I like to deal the price down on anything I buy, I don&#39;t just<br/>\n&gt;   throw plat at people for good items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All that said, I bought elfhide gloves from a friend of mine last<br/>\n&gt;week for 75pp.  She needed the money, and you know what?  I had<br/>\n&gt;the money.  For once in my poor EQ career, I was starting to earn<br/>\n&gt;money.  Anyone under level 25 can appreciate that... you won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;make money until you are around level 30 or so.  All the people<br/>\n&gt;who claim to make mad money are all over level 25 - there is no<br/>\n&gt;trick to it.  Level = Money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also bought two star ruby golden rings (300pp total - killer deal)<br/>\n&gt;Yes, because I had the money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Don&#39;t play me off as some cheap bastard like I was 11 levels ago,<br/>\n&gt;when I was lucky to make 10pp a night.  I&#39;m pulling down around<br/>\n&gt;50pp a night or so and I&#39;m happy as a clam to spend my money. =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Harmonic Distortion, 30th drummer.<br/>\n&gt;League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt;&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist members, don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt;Join our community member news update<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;here&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
