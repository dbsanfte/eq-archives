Part of this quest requires you to get a toupee made for a gnome<br/>\nin Akanon.  The toupee adds +10 to charisma.  Without spoiling all the<br/>\ndetails, to get the toupee made requires a component off a mermaid in Kedge<br/>\nKeep.  This requires a high level party to accomplish.  I&#39;ve already<br/>\ncompleted the first part of the quest but won&#39;t be able to get into Kedge<br/>\nfor at least 8-10 levels.  Would be nice if a high level friend could loot<br/>\nthe item off the mermaid, turn it into the gnome, and then I turn in the<br/>\nrest of the components and get the toupee.  May be violating the spirit of<br/>\ndoing the quest for yourself but like my old First Sergeant used to say: &quot;If<br/>\nyour not cheating your not trying!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Try Chanda/Baobob Miller in Q Hills as a test.
