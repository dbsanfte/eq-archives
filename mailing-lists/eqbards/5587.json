It looks like they are going to stop<br/>\nmost kiting (5 months too late).  Bards may still be able to kite with<br/>\nBellows and such.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nBRAD ON THE DOT ISSUE - NO MORE KITING<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was found on alt.games.everquest:<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted by Brad McQuaid on August 24, 1999 at 8:31:27PM<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kiting fix has nothing to do with range.  Essentially, DoT spells do not<br/>\ndamage the NPC if the NPC is chasing you and has a velocity. If he is not<br/>\nmoving or he is fleeing from you, the DoT does damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF we make this change live, and that&#39;s an IF at this point, we will most<br/>\nlikely also slightly increase  the durations of DoT spells to compensate for<br/>\nthe additional time necessary to cast the spells and  then set up your<br/>\ndefense (you tanking, another player tanking, a pet tanking, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Brad<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that this seems to have gone live already from reports (see<br/>\narticle below).  Supposedly this is meant to be a kiting fix, meaning if you<br/>\nare fleeing from a monster it won&#39;t take damage but if the monster flees<br/>\nfrom you it will. The reports I have in so far basically say if the  monster<br/>\nis out of your melee range it takes no damage. It could just be a bit of<br/>\nbuggy code right   now, but what Brad outlines above could certainly be<br/>\nfully implemented come next patch meaning no more kiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nDOT SPELL CHANGE - LIVE ON ALL SERVERS?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had two separate reports now that NPC&#39;s are not taking DoT damage<br/>\nonce out of the melee range on the public servers. This means the DoT change<br/>\nis not just a test server thing.<br/>\nIt has gone live. I will do some further testing tonight, but in the<br/>\nmeantime don&#39;t rely on your<br/>\nDoT&#39;s if the monsters does a runner on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDOT SPELLS -WHAT IS THE GO?<br/>\n<br/>\nOk then, here is the story as we know it. Bukaru reports that on Test Server<br/>\nif you are not within melee range then the DoT will have no effect damage<br/>\nwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis basically destroy&#39;s the major tactic for druids in getting experience<br/>\nin lower levels if this ends up getting published to the servers.  Kiting is<br/>\nfinished if this goes live. Whether kiting was ever intended to be a tactic<br/>\nby Verant is another matter altogether. I&#39;ll try to<br/>\nget an official word on all this from Verant, in the meantime keep sending<br/>\nin your information.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
