I live in Hawaii so at that time of the night there were<br/>\n&gt; less than 20 people in the zone and we were the only group at the dervish<br/>\n&gt; camp.  We only had four people in the party, a paladin, a ranger, a<br/>\n&gt; wizard,<br/>\n&gt; and myself (all around 13th level).  Because we were the only party at the<br/>\n&gt; site, when we arrived the entire camp was full of cutthroats, around 6 or<br/>\n&gt; 7<br/>\n&gt; total (fortunately no mages).  Knowing that we couldn&#39;t take them all on<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; once, I told the party to stay back and let me do some bard magic.  After<br/>\n&gt; equipping my mandolin, I proceeded to Lament (sadden) three cutthroats and<br/>\n&gt; attacked another one.  I ran back out to where my party was and we easily<br/>\n&gt; dispatched the cutthroats that followed.  Once we were ready, we<br/>\n&gt; dispatched<br/>\n&gt; the ones that I had initially Lamented.  After that, we were able to take<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; the cutthroats one by one as they respawned.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After the initials battles, my party thanked me for using the Lament<br/>\n&gt; tactic.<br/>\n&gt; They all stated they had grouped with bards before and had never seen the<br/>\n&gt; song used in the manner I had used it.  I thought that was odd because I<br/>\n&gt; heard about the trick from this forum so assumed a lot of other people<br/>\n&gt; used<br/>\n&gt; it frequently.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So what&#39;s the point of this post?  Well, the bard community needs to<br/>\n&gt; educate<br/>\n&gt; the other classes on everything that we can do for a party.  A lot of<br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; players seem to think that our main purpose in a group is to play Selo,<br/>\n&gt; Hymn, Anthem, and at higher levels, Mana regen.  I&#39;m only 13th level but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve learned there is a lot more to it than that.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anyone else knows of similar tactics that only a bard can perform I<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; like to hear about them also.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now for the rant<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After we cleared out the initial cutthroats, we were pretty much able to<br/>\n&gt; take them on one by one from that point on until we ran into a stumbling<br/>\n&gt; block.  Here is what happened.  The paladin, the ranger and myself, aided<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; the Anthem could easily handle one cutthroat at a time.  However, our<br/>\n&gt; wizard<br/>\n&gt; insisted on expending his mana with direct damage spells even though the<br/>\n&gt; tanks were whittling down the cutthroat without taking that much damage.<br/>\n&gt; The damage we were taking could quickly be healed via the Hymn after the<br/>\n&gt; combat was over.  What eventually happened was that the fully healed tanks<br/>\n&gt; ended up standing around while the wizard meditated.  In the meantime, the<br/>\n&gt; camp fully respawned.  This time, however, there were 3 mages plus a<br/>\n&gt; couple<br/>\n&gt; of thugs.  I tried the Lament trick again but a mage resisted and everyone<br/>\n&gt; got waxed except the wizard, who gated.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like telling other people how to play their character but how do<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; handle a magic user who insists on wasting his mana?  The group leader<br/>\n&gt; kept<br/>\n&gt; telling him to save mana but it didn&#39;t do any good.  I can see using one<br/>\n&gt; direct damage spell to help the combat but he would continue spellcasting<br/>\n&gt; once the cutthroat started to flee.  At this point, no one was in any<br/>\n&gt; danger<br/>\n&gt; because the cutthroat was fighting back.  He created a lot of needless<br/>\n&gt; downtime by his actions.  Any other recommendation other than finding a<br/>\n&gt; different group to adventure with?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; With more than 18 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ...ONElist is THE place where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
