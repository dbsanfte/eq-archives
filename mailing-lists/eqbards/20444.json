You just have to hunt in different regions.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that mobs for your level would be just to the right <br/>\n&gt; of where the<br/>\n&gt; river hits the lake. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hrm, maybe it was just a slow spawn night...that run through the<br/>\nspiders/leaches is pretty scary though, yow.
