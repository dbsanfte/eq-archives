The Shaman on the other hand had a strength 50 points higher than<br/>\nme and a stamina 40 points higher.  He had nearly 25% more hit points than I<br/>\ndid at the same level and an ac a whopping 7 points lower.  That would be<br/>\ndifficult to overcome.  The difference in our weapon skill was 18 points.<br/>\nIt mattered not one iota.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way it takes me well over a minute to beat up an Ice Boned skel in<br/>\nmelee alone.  Multiply me by three it still takes more than the &#39;laughable&#39;<br/>\n20 seconds it took the three druids.  For me its merely miss, miss, pierce<br/>\n11, miss, miss, pierce 9...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
