When I am not in my regular group I <br/>\nalways explain the tactics I will be using with something like this:<br/>\nTonight&#39;s song list consists of the following in regular combat: Anthem &#39;de <br/>\nArms (boast str, atk speed), Psalm of warth (grp damage shield and AC), <br/>\nchains (slow atk spd and snare).  Do not snare or root unless I call for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen a second one saying:<br/>\nIf a gob is glowing red and I am not attacking leave it alone I mesmirizing <br/>\nit.  If I call out charming so and so, I have charmed that gob.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany groups I have been in are amazed that one- I do not use bellow :), two- <br/>\nthat I can keep three song effects going.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for the life of me I can not understand why they whine so much when I <br/>\nsay good night, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
