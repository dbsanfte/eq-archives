It worked pretty well, but it&#39;s hard to balance, and really<br/>\ntough on the bookkeeper.  We abandoned it for dictatorial socialism.  Any item won in a guild group (more<br/>\nthan 50% guild members) is guild property, and is assigned by the guild leaders based on guild need.<br/>\nItems stay in guild until nobody wants them, at which point they&#39;re sold to finance Sky raids and such or<br/>\ntraded for usable items.  You would think this would open us up for a lot of whining, but we&#39;ve had very<br/>\nlittle trouble with it.  The few people who didn&#39;t like it quit, the rest are fine with it.  We&#39;re about<br/>\n80 members, most with at least one character above 50, so it&#39;s not like this is a tiny group of close<br/>\nfriends either.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado &lt;Silent Justice&gt;, 53 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon Hughes wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Wow!
