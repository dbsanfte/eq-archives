You don&#39;t get to hit /quit or any other command.<br/>\nYou die before you zone in on your client as you zone in on the server for a<br/>\nbit before you appear on the client side.  All you see is a never ending<br/>\nstream of Loading...Please wait messages. No command bar, no reports of<br/>\ndamage, no view of Grobb, nothing, period.  And your supposed safe spot may<br/>\nalso be the real spot for a guard that&#39;s been trained temporarily elsewhere<br/>\nwhich is worse if you don&#39;t know it.  He then returns to his spot every time<br/>\nthe server is reset, if he ever leaves it.  How do I know all this, there&#39;s<br/>\na lower level Kitasi on Solusek that was my first bard who listened to a<br/>\nmonk and got bound in Grobb.  Went from 12th to 9th before they lowered the<br/>\ndeath penalty before I realized it wasn&#39;t some glitch and reset my computer.<br/>\nNeedless to say he hasn&#39;t seen any action since as I moved to a server where<br/>\nI had friends who could bind.  Also only the time alive counts towards the<br/>\n30seconds.  The time passing thru the Loading period doesn&#39;t so you die<br/>\nhowever many times that guard can kill you before you react and cut the<br/>\nconnection plus the 30+ seconds of linkdead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there is no excuse for any player to die 20 times in a row in one of<br/>\nthese unfortunate instances. If you respawn and are immediately attacked by<br/>\na guard at your bind point, you need to use the /quit command. This<br/>\nimmediately exits you from the game without the 30 second camping wait. You<br/>\nmay need to wait a few minutes for that guard to return to his post before<br/>\nreentering the game, or you may have to resort to moving the guard with a<br/>\nmule character. Such are the dangers inherent in binding in enemy territory.<br/>\nBut again, that does not mean it&#39;s not feasible. Just dangerous. Everyone&#39;s<br/>\npersonal limit of danger varies.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeledal<br/>\nBard of Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
