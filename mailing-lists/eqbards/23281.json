I think there needs to be better alternatives to<br/>\nclerics to imporve EQ at high levels.  BUT, from my cleric&#39;s perspective,<br/>\ndruids and shamans get a lot of nice spells that we don&#39;t get.  So there has<br/>\nto be a big difference in our healing ability to make up for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth classes get SOW, which makes life so much better.<br/>\nDruids get ports.  Nuff said...<br/>\nShamans get haste/slow which in can compensate greatly for a lack of<br/>\nhealing.<br/>\nDruids can solo effectively.<br/>\nBoth get regens.<br/>\n<br/>\nClerics get nothing in those fields.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso shamans and druids can deal damage much better than a cleric can<br/>\n(through DOT&#39;s DD&#39;s, Dam Shields, etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the poster who said complete heal wa sprobably not a good idea.<br/>\nIt was fine when lvl 50 was the max, since you&#39;re tanks HP could get too out<br/>\nof hand.  Now with lvl 60 tanks, lvl 60 buffs and better equipment, the<br/>\nspell is unbalancing.  And it lives Verant in a quandry.  Mobs that are<br/>\nmeant to be challenging could become comically easy for a group with a<br/>\nwarrior/cleric, or mobs that are meant to be challenging could become<br/>\nimpossible for a group without.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow what to do about it?  Improving druid/shaman healing is probably good<br/>\nfor the game.  But where does it leave clerics?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is similar to the bard/enchanter discussion about mez.  I think their<br/>\nsolution to it was fine.. Bards (especially once you get SoT) are a<br/>\ntolerable replacment for an enchanter, but definitly not even close to<br/>\nequal.  WIth the current healing issue I hope they do the same.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
