Fire up selos with the drum<br/>\nand all you have to do is just run by them and slow long enough for them to<br/>\ncome after you (Try to not pull more than two Gnolls OR one Undead - much<br/>\nless down time). Then I run back near the water because the wandering<br/>\nreavers only come out so far - and there isn&#39;t that much that goes by the<br/>\nwater.... When you pull them back to the water try to avoid anything that<br/>\nmight join in the chase on the way back, but sometimes a puppy or two (wolf)<br/>\nmight come too... then, because selos with drum is fast and you got to your<br/>\nspot WAY before those slow reavers - you have time to switch to the<br/>\nlute/brass and get ready to start beating on them with the songs!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how I put my hotkey bank for them:<br/>\n<br/>\nDDD          CoD<br/>\nHymn        Melee Slot<br/>\nInventory    Inventory<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if this will come thru but here&#39;s a cut of the hotkey bank from a screen shot I took:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully you guys can see this... if not, and you want to see, I can send it to anyone privately....
