The<br/>\nother 50% is often a group that didn&#39;t know what a Bard did ... or they<br/>\nnever have considered startegy for any of thier members (run!).  She has<br/>\nbeen both enthusiastically welcomed, and booted because she wasn&#39;t twisting<br/>\n(read my hands got tired twitching) fast enough for thier expectations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSure, leave a bad group.  But good groups expect Bards to twist.  I<br/>\nactually have no problem with that .. but .. I can&#39;t handle more than 1 to<br/>\n1 1/2 hour of the &quot;twitch&quot; motion required.  Its further compounded by the<br/>\nfact that for RP reasons my Bard is more a singer than a fighter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Bards are suposed to &quot;twist&quot; or stack songs, it would be nice to have it<br/>\nbuilt in to the interface to do so without wrist-endangerment.  We would<br/>\nstill be finger active anyway to switch instrument/weapon and I would<br/>\nexpect one-shot (non-persistent) songs like Bellow to still be hot-key<br/>\ndriven.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess its the difference between a single shot effect, and a persistent<br/>\nbuff type effect.  A low level cleric can cast Holy Armor and Courage<br/>\n(stacking with one key stroke each), they&#39;re stacked, he&#39;s done typing.<br/>\nThe Bard however cannot stack without continuous keystrokes (the twitch<br/>\npart I take exception to).  If we&#39;re supposed to stack persistent songs ...<br/>\ngive us a mechanism that isn&#39;t &quot;twitch&quot; driven to do so.  Or stop<br/>\nadvertising that this isn&#39;t a twitch game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:22 AM 5/8/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: SteelWolf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwlf@...\">steelwlf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I TOTALLY disagree.
