I have hunted here quite a bit (100 hours?).<br/>\nAnd I have never seen these guys charm.  = P.

This spell REALLY helps alot.  I would have the bard<br/>\nuse this first before the argo change to tashania , why  not he was meleeing<br/>\nanyways, and I could slow without having to cast Tashania and get myself<br/>\nbeat down.  Then I could tashania after it was slowed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 22, 2001 2:03 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Mob that Wouldn&#39;t Mez<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in The Courtyard Area of The Hole last night and twice we fought<br/>\nElemental Channelers would couldn&#39;t be mezzed.
