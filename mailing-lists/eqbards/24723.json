Let&#39;s say, Gaelthorne, the bored Bard is soloing. Now, I am <br/>\nlucky and I find two mobs with 2000 hp each (hey, it&#39;s just an <br/>\nexample, go with it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI charm MOB A to fight MOB B, when MOB B is down to 500 life, I go in <br/>\nfor the kill. If I use MOB A to finish the fight, I get half exp (As <br/>\nfar as I know -- I believe this to be true.). If I let charm drop and <br/>\nkill MOB B, MOB B will disappear and I will get NO exp. Why is this? <br/>\nSimple, 1500 HP of damage is assigned to a MOB (remember the guards <br/>\nin the newbie areas?) If you are outdamaged by a MOB, say bye, bye to <br/>\nthe exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne,<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
