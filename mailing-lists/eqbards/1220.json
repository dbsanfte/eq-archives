As a result, I can&#39;t post this question on EQVault.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last night while adventuring in Lesser Faydark, my party was attacked by <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;Spider Queen (can&#39;t remember her last name).  I had never seen this NPC<br/>\n&gt;before so perhaps this is part of a new quest.  I do know we killed a lot <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;giant spiders so that may have caused her to spawn.  Anyway, after we <br/>\n&gt;killed<br/>\n&gt;her, I looted an item called a pulsating brood clutch.  Right-clicking on<br/>\n&gt;the item only displayed the name and the weight.  Didn&#39;t mention anything<br/>\n&gt;like Lore/Magic item.  I asked around and no one had ever heard of this<br/>\n&gt;item.  I went to a shop and was offered 7PP for it.  Thinking it may be a<br/>\n&gt;quest item, I decided not to sell it.  I also looted a poison sac from the<br/>\n&gt;Queen. The icons for the two items are similar, both looking like a kidney.<br/>\n&gt;My guess is if this item is not a quest item, it can be used by a rogue to<br/>\n&gt;create poison, although I don&#39;t think this skill has been implemented yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does anyone have any information on this item?  I need the PP but if its<br/>\n&gt;part of a quest would like to try and solve it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On a related note, I saw three other named NPCs in Lesser Faydark last<br/>\n&gt;night.  One was Crookstinger, a NPC wasp, another was a named fairie whose<br/>\n&gt;name I can&#39;t recollect, and the unicorn Equestrielle.  In addition to the<br/>\n&gt;Spider Queen, I had never seen any of these NPCs before.  There were <br/>\n&gt;several<br/>\n&gt;groups in the area attacking both wasps and fairie creatures.  The general<br/>\n&gt;consensus of everyone in the area was that killing these creatures caused<br/>\n&gt;Crookstinger and the named fairie to appear.  No one was foolish/brave<br/>\n&gt;enough to attack the unicorn.  Its good to see that Verant has started to<br/>\n&gt;beef up some of the zones.  Has anyone notived similar additions in other<br/>\n&gt;zones?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin<br/>\n&gt;E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ever since beta Verant has been steadily adding more critters to the various <br/>\nzones. In beta 3 there were no monsters (or npc&#39;s) in the East Karanas. They <br/>\nstocked it ful of baddies in beta4 taking many travellers by surprise. My <br/>\nfriend was talking to the npc paladin (forget his name) there one evening, <br/>\nand was attacked by a werewolf. He was saved by the paladin, thankfully. <br/>\nFirst time I saw Equestrielle was in beta4, it was a black horse with red <br/>\neyes and no horn, looked kind of like a nightmare(sp?) from AD&D, but it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t aggressive. Crookstinger is probly about as new as Equestrielle. Not <br/>\nsure about the named faerie.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking the same thing - they probly spawn the same way the Minotaur <br/>\nHero in Steamfont does, after you&#39;ve killed some of the weaker of their <br/>\nrace, they want revenge =)<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 11th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
