I thought of <br/>\none more reason why it doesn&#39;t work this way:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it did, they wouldn&#39;t have to add &quot;out of thin air&quot; the penalty <br/>\nback in, they could just rework the equation to take off the <br/>\npenalty.  Why have an equation like<br/>\n<br/>\nBard_Exp_gained = Base_exp - 0.4*Base_exp + 0.4*Base_exp<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen they could just use<br/>\n<br/>\nBard_Exp_gained = Base_exp <br/>\n<br/>\nto the same end result?  I can see no reason why this simple equation <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t work.  Also, they went to great lengths to describe how <br/>\nchanging the experience tables would not work (i.e. it would give <br/>\nevery Hybrid an additional few levels) for there to not actually be <br/>\nthese experience tables.  They WOULD have had an easier time <br/>\nimplementing this change if it did work that way (and we probably <br/>\nwould have seen the change a lot sooner - I got the impression that <br/>\nthey would have done it sooner had they been able to figure out HOW).<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand where you&#39;re coming from, tho.  Back to the original <br/>\nstatement that was made, I don&#39;t think that guy was saying what <br/>\nyou&#39;re saying.  At least, he didn&#39;t respond to the posts saying, &quot;I <br/>\nunderstand where you&#39;re coming from, but what if it works this <br/>\nway...&quot;.  I, honestly, just think he didn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
