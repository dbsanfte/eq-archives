Gateway<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mix/match motherboards.  They have 1 motherboard for one chip type<br/>\n(Pentium) and another for Athlons (you have to, they&#39;re not compatible)<br/>\nGenerally speaking, up to about a year ago, Gateway shipped 90% of systems<br/>\nwith the 440BX (argueably the best chipset ever) board from Intel (if you<br/>\noverclock it it IS the best board out and can use 133mhz SDRAM on it).<br/>\nThey had a couple other boards that shipped with E-Series (IE: Business)<br/>\nsystems but the customer systems were all shipped based on 440 BX boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy PIII 550 is on a 440BX and I have it overclocked to 133mhz bus with<br/>\n133mhz SDRAM.  It outperforms my best friend&#39;s PIII 700 and I haven&#39;t even<br/>\noverclocked the processor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, nice system.  But you got lied to about Gateway ;)  (I should<br/>\nknow.  I work at a Gateway Manufacturing center as a contracted Network<br/>\nEngineer)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
