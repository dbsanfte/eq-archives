You","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1198834782\">Pick-up groups in Blackburrow Paw or Crushbone suck. They continued to suck<br/>\nin Unrest. Ditto, Cazic. Sol-B. And Lower Guk.  People just don&#39;t change<br/>\nmuch.  You get the kind that is so focused on loot that unless they are<br/>\ngetting loot - they are sure someone else is stealing it from them.  They<br/>\ndon&#39;t trust others because they project their own personality traits.  On<br/>\nour server, we have recent reports of a guy in lower guk stealing off a<br/>\nparty member who has died and has given consent to drag. Instead of getting<br/>\nbetter at high levels - it seems like it gets worse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn reality, it&#39;s just the same idiots but instead of level 5, they are level<br/>\n50.  Do you honestly expect that someone is going to have major personality<br/>\nchanges in like 6 to 9 months simply by playing a computer game? Granted<br/>\nsome do, but for the most part - they don&#39;t. Any power they get just<br/>\nenhances already ingrained traits.  Simply a guild does not cure this<br/>\neither.  There are plenty of guilds with bickering about loots.  But if you<br/>\nare guilded and you are with your guild group, at least you know what to<br/>\nexpect and you maybe have some standard loot rules.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBardette of 43 songs<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tCranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tTuesday, February 01, 2000 12:43 PM<br/>\nTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Ok I need advice...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tLast night....
