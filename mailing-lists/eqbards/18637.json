No<br/>\n&gt; problem, I thought, charm a spare 1 and keep it and its friend busy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So off I go, charm a giant, and set it to attack the other one the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the party is hitting.  My new friend is happily bashing the<br/>\n&gt; other one until it wears off, and then jumps on me.  So charm it<br/>\n&gt; again, and lo and behold it suddenly starts hitting my party members.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wait a minute, I think!  Stop it, attack the giant.  But no, it<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t leave my party alone, and then jumped on me when the charm<br/>\n&gt; wore off again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Testing this out a little more .... I&#39;ve been playing around lately in<br/>\n&gt; Rathe Mountains with my dwarven cleric companion.  He roots them, I<br/>\n&gt; chant them to death, it&#39;s great!  Anyway, when we had 2 giants, I<br/>\n&gt; charmed 1 and set it to attack the other.  When charm broke, I<br/>\n&gt; recharmed and it went straight back to hitting the other giant.  No<br/>\n&gt; problem at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anybody else had any little hiccups with charm?  Is it just a<br/>\n&gt; Dreadlands thing?  A Kunark thing?  A me thing?  Or don&#39;t they like<br/>\n&gt; the kind of music I play! &lt;sniff&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Melaniel, Wood Elf Bard (41)<br/>\n&gt; finally out of hell and resuming a World Tour<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ... and a host of others<br/>\n&gt; Mith Marr server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; 72% off on Name brand Watches!<br/>\n&gt; Come and buy today and get free shipping!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4011/10/_/451022/_/958480672/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4011/10/_/451022/_/958480672/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Make new friends, find the old at Classmates.com:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4052/10/_/451022/_/958490032/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4052/10/_/451022/_/958490032/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
