Solon s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-176633543\">Snagged from Everlore...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022720.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022720.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Why is higher level spell a downgrade to a lower level one?<br/>\n<br/>\nSolon&#39;s Song of the Sirens: Target charm, short duration.<br/>\nSolon&#39;s Bravura: Target charm, short duration, higher level cap, decreases<br/>\nmagic resistance, costs mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nBravura has a higher level cap, but it has a double resist rate (once for<br/>\nthe Charm, once for the MR decrease) and it costs mana. Also, the MR<br/>\ndecrease is completely worthless, WORSE than worthless because it makes the<br/>\npet weaker than it was before it was charmed! Meanwhile you can&#39;t cast on it<br/>\nso the lower MR is not useful to you in the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does it decrease Magic Resistance? There&#39;s no point to it except to make<br/>\nthe song less worthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon&#39;s reply:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe components don&#39;t resist separatly. Spells only save versus one resist,<br/>\nand only save once unless special code is put in to have them do something<br/>\nelse, such as with Lullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe magic resistance probably makes it a bad spell component combo. When the<br/>\ncoder comes in tomorrow I&#39;ll see if that has any possible positive effect.<br/>\nIf not, we&#39;ll look at another potential component.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbiturique responds:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t understand how charm work. At every tick (or so) your charmed pet<br/>\nwill make a MR check to see if he can break your charm. That is why charm<br/>\nduration appears to be random. Lowering his MR will generally make the charm<br/>\nlast longer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon slips out of the discussion with:<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s certainly a possibility, but I&#39;ll find out for certain tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Gordon&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems this was posted on Tuesday, and there&#39;s yet to be a response based<br/>\non his findings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was all ready to tag my thoughts onto this, but I&#39;ve just been called to a<br/>\nmeeting (*sigh* - I hate when work interrupts), so I&#39;ll leave you lot to<br/>\ndiscuss and I&#39;ll catch up later. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
