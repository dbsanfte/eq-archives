Alcohol tolerance requires that you make a saving roll before there<br/>\nis a skill check, modified by your skill level. There are very few SOS<br/>\nskills in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe vast majority of combat skills (with the exception of Instill Doubt)<br/>\nwill make a skill check every instance they are used, (SBU, skill by use)<br/>\nnot every instance of success  Keep in mind that the monsters you are<br/>\nfighting, or defending yourself from MUST be in your experience range.  Some<br/>\ngreens that don&#39;t give you exp in a group will still allow you to skill<br/>\nthough.  The reason is, they are just at the lower limit of your exp range,<br/>\nand if you were solo you would have received a modicum of experience for the<br/>\nkill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the relative difference in level between you and your opponent will<br/>\nmodify the skill chances.  Fighting a low blue means you are less likely to<br/>\nskill than fighting a high red, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some skills are scaled higher than others.  It&#39;s less likely that you<br/>\nwill increase Offense than it is that you will increase a weapons skill.<br/>\nSame with Defense, being harder to skill than dodge, parry, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a list of combat related SBU skills<br/>\n<br/>\nAll Weapons skills (checked each swing )<br/>\nOffense (checked each swing)<br/>\nRanged and Archery (checked each throw/shot)<br/>\nDefense (checked each incoming attack)<br/>\nDodge(checked each incoming attack)<br/>\nParry (checked each incoming attack)<br/>\nRiposte(checked each incoming attack)<br/>\nBlock(checked each incoming attack)<br/>\n Backstab(checked each use)<br/>\nMonk special attacks(checked each use)<br/>\nDisarm(checked each use)<br/>\nKick (checked each use)<br/>\nBash(checked each use)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 18, 1999 2:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Dragoon Dirk (off topic somewhat?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;J.M.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a question about one of your statements in your previous<br/>\n&gt;post:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dumping skill points into it won&#39;t make it level faster by<br/>\n&gt;use.  1 skill or<br/>\n&gt; 100, the chances of skilling are the same every swing, all<br/>\n&gt;else being equal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From my experience, I have not found this to be true in the case of<br/>\n&gt;non-combat skills.  When I first created my character, I trained one point<br/>\n&gt;in sense-heading.  I continually used that skill when moving around.<br/>\n&gt;However, it almost never went up.  By the time I was 7th level, my sense<br/>\n&gt;heading was only 5.  I got tired of getting lost so I put 5 more points in<br/>\n&gt;it to raise it to 10.  Within the next hour or so, my skill in Sense<br/>\nHeading<br/>\n&gt;increased to 20. I&#39;m now 15th level.  I can now max out my skill in Sense<br/>\n&gt;Heading every time I level within five minutes.  My experience with alcohol<br/>\n&gt;tolerance was very similar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Could you please clarify your original statement?  Were you<br/>\n&gt;referring to combat skills only are were you referring to all skills?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt; Bard and Master Brewer on E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist has 170,000 e-mail communities from which to choose! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
