Call to Action<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 11 Oct 1999 17:20:05 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Bummer.  I ran into a Necro that had the same attitude.  Not in the<br/>\n&gt;      mood to argue I just played jig evey once and awile (when I was doing<br/>\n&gt;      nothing else) to shut him up.  (just the two of us and I could tell <br/>\n&gt;no<br/>\n&gt;      amount of arguing whould change his mind)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Perhaps you should have just run a test right then and there.  Have a<br/>\n&gt;      caster cast a spell, have someone else time it, med, Repeat with jig,<br/>\n&gt;      med.   This would have proved to your group what an idiot he was.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      The big problem is that seversl of the big web sites list the jig <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;      this capability!!!! (EQstratics is one I think) We need to all <br/>\n&gt;contact<br/>\n&gt;      these web sites and get them to correct this error.  This would at<br/>\n&gt;      least help the situation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Bujold<br/>\n&gt;      22 (!!)<br/>\n&gt;      Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m gonna do that now since I don&#39;t have much else to do at the moment. =)<br/>\nEQ?
