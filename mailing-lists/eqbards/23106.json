I posted it a long time ago <br/>\nas well, but this may help others:<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n<br/>\nNostrolo Tambourine Quest Checklist<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Windleaf Mistsong, Red Sky, Bertoxxulous<br/>\nWith a couple of comments by Sylly Songsynger and -=B=- taken from<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a> list.<br/>\n<br/>\nStar of Odus Purchase for 105 pp (use your carillon) in jewel shop under<br/>\nErudin palace. Make sure you have an empty space in your main inventory.<br/>\nGive Star of Odus to Wellford in Firiona Vie Bank and receive Tin Box with<br/>\n6 slots. (I didn&#39;t have space and had to do this again. GM&#39;s won&#39;t help you.)<br/>\nCoins (not in any particular order). Identify each with your Cataloging<br/>\nLibretto:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Torsis Ton -- Foraged in Emerald Forest<br/>\nBest to have someone forage for you due to our limited forage skill<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Royal Crown of Dalnir -- Kly Implicator in Dalnir<br/>\nIt comes from the Library area, off of a Failed Crypt Raider. (-=B=-)<br/>\nKly Imprecator either on 2nd floor (church?) or 3rd floor down back<br/>\ntowrds the main Kly (dining room) in the lab on the left as you go in.<br/>\n(Sylly Songsynger)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Terraz Gon -- Failed Raider in Kaesora, behind library. Probably hardest<br/>\none to get.<br/>\nFailed Crypt Raider near the library (4 or so &#39;names&#39; rotate thru the<br/>\nlibrary spawn cycle - if you dont see him the first time - stick around for<br/>\na couple hours or so and he pops eventually.) (Sylly Songsynger)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Veksar Gran -- Bloodgill Goblins in Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>\nLook at the base of the pillars around the center of the lake. (-=B=-)<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Danak Gran -- Scorpoid Scrounger in The Overthere<br/>\nGo in invis and track a scrounger who is down in ravine. After you hit<br/>\nhim, get invis back up and lead him out of ravine (really helps to have<br/>\nSOW). I accidentally brought up another scorpion, but I charmed scrounger<br/>\nand had him kill it. Then fear/chained scrounger to death. They do harm<br/>\ntouch, but I was able to do this as a 35 bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Ik Gran -- Captain of the Guard from City of Mist<br/>\nObtainable if you are in a group by the zone.<br/>\nCombine Tin Box and return to Wellford for Tambourine!<br/>\n<br/>\nComments:<br/>\nYou can buy the coins from players. Just be polite and don&#39;t spam the zone<br/>\nwith requests. I usually would do just one request when I entered the zone<br/>\nas a courtesy to others. You can frequently get the coins for free if you<br/>\nare polite. However, for the Kaesora coin, I was gladly offering to pay<br/>\n50pp as hardly anyone was ever in Kaesora on Bertox server, and when there<br/>\nwere people in Kaesora, a lot of times it was people from a Japanese<br/>\nguild. On other servers with lots of Kaesora hunters, you should get this<br/>\neasily). ---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:11 PM 1/12/01 -0700, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;How much does he Harmtouch for?
