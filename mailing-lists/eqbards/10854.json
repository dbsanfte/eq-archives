On Sunday I<br/>\nexplored and got familiar with the undead area between the zone and the<br/>\nassassin room.  On Monday I called out to be put on the mask list at 10am<br/>\nCST.  I got into the assassin group by 5pm CST and finally looted the mask<br/>\nat 10:30pm CST.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole time I was there, a friend from my guild was waiting for the TBB.<br/>\nHe had been there for 24 hours straight and did not see one single pop of<br/>\nthe ghoul supplier...he finally gave up and logged out due to exhaustion.<br/>\nNow that&#39;s an absurdly tedious camp, and I thought I was losing my mind<br/>\nafter 5 hours in that blasted assassin/supplier room.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor 5 of the hours we camped that room I was the group leader and it was<br/>\nextremely hard because when you put 6 people in that tiny little room for<br/>\nthat long they start to get irritated and tempers start to flare...we had<br/>\nmore arguments over stupid inane stuff, mostly how to go about doing the<br/>\nlooting of the alleged TBB shout the elusive supplier spawn (I still have<br/>\nnot seen this supplier to date) that I never ever ever want to be in that<br/>\nroom again.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hey, I got my mask and only died twice for my efforts...heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also a late bloomer bard obtaining my lambent armor and I can identify<br/>\nwith Crier in his woes.  I just got my first piece, the breastplate, on<br/>\nSaturday night and before that I kept getting tells from strangers, &quot;why<br/>\ndon&#39;t you have any lambent armor yet?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I&#39;m not a twink!  I have earned every single item I have the hard<br/>\nway and Faras is not only my first character in EQ, he is my only character<br/>\nand I have over 35 days played too...I am level 35 with one piece of<br/>\nlambent.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there Crier, don&#39;t pay attention to those that take the &quot;easy path&quot;<br/>\nbecause really, they are only hurting themselves.  Play the game you want<br/>\nand enjoy it as long as can.
