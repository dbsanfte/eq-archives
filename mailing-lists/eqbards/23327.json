How comfortable is the group with bard mezzing?<br/>\n2. How comfortable is the BARD with mezzing? .. How skilled? (i.e. can he<br/>\nkeep far enough away that hes not getting beaten upon...<br/>\n3.  How good is the group.. (i.e. assist, giving the bard room to mezz etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen both good and bad bards do this... I think the biggest factors for<br/>\nsuccess are that the bard needs to be comfortable doing it and he also need<br/>\nto communicate.  For instance, I hate charming, i&#39;m still not comfortable<br/>\nwith it.  If I&#39;m in a group and someone says &quot;charm it&quot;.. i&#39;m like .. oh<br/>\nugh.. eep.. uh.. *whack whack whack die* (me not the mob)... so I usually<br/>\ntell people in the group that i&#39;m nto that good at it yet (still practicing)<br/>\nand that i would rather either mez or just tank the dang thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHalana, 58th Shaman (only 12 VP deaths this weekend!)<br/>\nTani, 40th Bard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Daniel P.

There IS still a secondary resist. <br/>\n&gt;  My experience<br/>\n&gt; in Sebelis is that it resists so much its worse than Charm as <br/>\n&gt; far as the<br/>\n&gt; need for a heal.  At 52 with very good people my experience <br/>\n&gt; is still think<br/>\n&gt; you need either a cleric or a shaman (slowing mobs) to do the <br/>\n&gt; crowd control<br/>\n&gt; in Sebelis.  With an mediocre group you need a chanter.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had a lot better luck in Karnor.  The mobs are low enough <br/>\n&gt; level difference<br/>\n&gt; that the resistance is not as much an issue (at 52 - at 50 Pixie was<br/>\n&gt; resisted a lot) I was able to keep mobs mezzed enough to stay <br/>\n&gt; in business.<br/>\n&gt; However this was with a VERY good group - but we had a LOT of mobs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 22, 2001 11:51 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] OT Complete heal (was Numbers on Bards)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 05:51 PM 1/21/01 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yes with the RIGHT group (ie bard and shaman instead of cleric and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;enchanter) and four other people who are VERY good - you can <br/>\n&gt; go without the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;enchanter/cleric combo.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t have to have everyone be that good.  just the <br/>\n&gt; important spots.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;My own personal experience with myself doing crowd control - <br/>\n&gt; if I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;either cleric healing power - or shaman slowing power - I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; going to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;killed trying to do crowd control in Sebelis.  Maybe I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; been unlucky with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the group&#39;s I&#39;ve had; and also - I haven&#39;t got 53 yet - so <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m relying on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Charm or Pixie Strike - but the point I think is still there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; well i wouldn&#39;t use charm in sebilis without a shaman or <br/>\n&gt; cleric, i would use<br/>\n&gt; pixie<br/>\n&gt; or twilight.  the shaman or cleric just opens up more <br/>\n&gt; opportunities for<br/>\n&gt; flexibility.<br/>\n&gt; note that you&#39;ve already backed down from the original <br/>\n&gt; statement which was<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; a cleric and enchanter are 100% required for any group post <br/>\n&gt; 50 (in a kunark<br/>\n&gt; dungeon),<br/>\n&gt; and that statement was the only thing i had a problem with.  <br/>\n&gt; i don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; how well<br/>\n&gt; pixie works, they fixed both songs after i had twilight and i <br/>\n&gt; always use<br/>\n&gt; twilight instead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;         But maybe - I&#39;m just mediocre...  Regardless - <br/>\n&gt; maybe you feel that<br/>\n&gt; 80 per<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cent of the people in the game are mediocre.  Maybe they are <br/>\n&gt; - but to me<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;game is about having an enjoyable entertainment experience; not about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;competing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; that may be true for you, but the &#39;&#39;hard&#39;&#39; parts of the game <br/>\n&gt; need to be<br/>\n&gt; tuned to the<br/>\n&gt; good players, not the average players.  otherwise where are <br/>\n&gt; the good players<br/>\n&gt; going<br/>\n&gt; to go for challenge and fun?
