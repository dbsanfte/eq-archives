Bank two has my inventory slots, so I can","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-83708023\">I use four banks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBank one, the default when you log in, has 1 Hide, 2 Sneak, 3 Selos, 4 Hymn,<br/>\n5 Clarity, and 6 Run.<br/>\n<br/>\nBank two has my inventory slots, so I can quickly switch from weapon to<br/>\ninstrument, as well as Hymn, since often when I switch to lute, it&#39;s to<br/>\nheal.  Handy to have it right there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBank three is my combat bank, it&#39;s full up with songs, with certain mainstay<br/>\nsongs always in the same slot, and others moved around to fit the situation.<br/>\nIn most cases its my Combat song as 1 (that varies now, as I twiddle between<br/>\nAnthem, Celerity, and Berzerker), 2 is usually an Area slow down song<br/>\n(Melodic binding for a long while, now it&#39;s Chords of Cessation.)  3 is<br/>\nALWAYS Selos, 4 is always Consonant Chain, 5 is always Bellow, and 6 varies,<br/>\nusually between Screech and Lullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nBank Four is a utility bank,  I have Hide again, Tracking, Forage, Assist,<br/>\nBind Wounds, and Selos.  Matter of fact, Selos is on the 3 slot on all six<br/>\nbanks.  I don&#39;t have Sense Heading hotboxed, with this much time in the<br/>\ngame, I&#39;m never lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it&#39;s MUCH MUCH MUCH quicker to have songs hotkeyed than it is<br/>\ntracking a mouse all over the screen, and since I play at 1024 resolution<br/>\nand full screen, that&#39;s a lot of mouse moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a snap to hit SHIFT # to move from bank to bank, and after all this<br/>\ntime, it&#39;s second nature.  I find myself hitting 6, then 3 first thing when<br/>\nI log in(run and Selos), SHIFT 3 to move right to the combat songs, SHIFT 2<br/>\nto twiddle inventory, SHIFT 4 then 2 to catch a quick Tracking, SHIFT 1 then<br/>\n5 to fire up Clarity for the casters, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I rarely if ever mouselook in the game.   I prefer to have my hands on<br/>\nthe keyboard as much as possible.  I know there are those that hate keyboard<br/>\nturning, but other than that, mouselook and button clicking tends to slow<br/>\nyou down in combat, especially when there&#39;s a lot going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to LOOK for the cursor, make sure it&#39;s on the right button, click<br/>\nit, and move it elsewhere, whereas with keyboard commands, it&#39;s all<br/>\nintuitive, and you never have to take your eyes off the text box.  Cycling<br/>\nsongs is easier too, it&#39;s just tap tap then tap tap again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use the mouse to open distant doors (the U key most times, if I&#39;m going<br/>\nthrough), to target mobs at long range (other times, it&#39;s my N key, which is<br/>\nmapped to Nearest NPC), and to loot mobs and open trade windows.  And of<br/>\ncourse to juggle inventory around.  I will mouselook in places like<br/>\nCauldron, where there&#39;s a lot of cliffs, as I can avoid falls easier, being<br/>\nable to hug the hillsides.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, it&#39;s all keyboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as having assist mapped, it&#39;s two quick key strokes to change<br/>\nhotboxes. In my case, I use F2-F6 to target the party member, then SHIFT 4,<br/>\nthen 4, I&#39;ve just assisted my target.  Takes less than half a second.  Then<br/>\nI hit SHIFT 3, then 1, to fire up my combat song, then 5 to bellow, or 6 to<br/>\nlull, etc.  Combat is done, I hit SHIFT 2, then move weapons down and lute<br/>\nup, after hitting 6 to sing Hymn.  While I&#39;m hymning, I&#39;ll hit SHIFT 4<br/>\nagain, then 3, to Forage, or 2 to Track.  Health is back, we&#39;re ready to<br/>\nfight again, it&#39;s SHIFT 2, put weapons back in hand, SHIFT 3, get ready to<br/>\nfight again.  If we have to run away, no matter which hotbox I&#39;m on, it&#39;s 3,<br/>\nSelos starts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: EQBards &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 4:51 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Macro setup for bards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The recent discussion on the use of the /assist command has got me<br/>\nwondering<br/>\n&gt;how other bards setup their macros.  For myself, up to this point I have<br/>\n&gt;only used one bank (6 hot-keys) of macros.  I have not setup the other five<br/>\n&gt;banks.  If I have confused anyone, I use the term bank to refer to the six<br/>\n&gt;buttons you can hotkey in the lower left hand portion of your screen.  You<br/>\n&gt;can hit Shift-# to switch banks or you can use your mouse to cycle through<br/>\n&gt;them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For my first bank, I have two inventory slots and two melee slots macroed<br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt;I quickly switch from weapon/shield to an instrument if the situation calls<br/>\n&gt;for it.  I have hot-keyed Sense Heading and Foraging to take up the other<br/>\n&gt;two slots.  I hotkeyed Sense Heading so when I am fleeing I dont have to<br/>\n&gt;worry about switching macro banks.  I have Foraging hotkeyed so I can<br/>\n&gt;continually click on it in between combats.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I haven&#39;t worried about macroing songs because I can click on them with my<br/>\n&gt;mouse just as easy as hitting the hotkey.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m beginning to think that I should place /assist on my main macro bank<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t like the idea of moving Sense Heading or Forage to another bank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How does everyone else have their hotkeys setup?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin<br/>\n&gt;E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Have you entered ONElist&#39;s &quot;Grow to Give&quot; program?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Deadline is June 19.
