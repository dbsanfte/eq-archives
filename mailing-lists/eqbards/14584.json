Our underwater breathing (UB) song does<br/>\n&gt; not override Enduring Breath (EB).  If EB is up and you start singing UB,<br/>\nEB<br/>\n&gt; will still be up when you stop singing.  However, if you are singing UB<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t have EB, EB will not stick if someone tries to cast it on you.<br/>\n&gt; You have to stop UB first in order to get EB to stick.  While in Kedge, I<br/>\n&gt; always have UB memmed.  Whenever someone announces EB is dropping, I get<br/>\nUB<br/>\n&gt; ready in case they start drowning.  Saved a 50 paladin the other night<br/>\n&gt; because of it.  To say the least he was glad I had it ready.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Note to Laluni:  I&#39;ll be in Kedge tonight around 9PM PST if I can get a<br/>\nride<br/>\n&gt; from Ogguk.  Hope to see you and the rest of DoH there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Speaking of kedge... any of you know if our water breathing song<br/>\noverrides<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enduring breath?  In other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; words.  I&#39;d like to keep it memed in case of emergencies, but will it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cause everyone else&#39;s enduring<br/>\n&gt; &gt; breath&#39;s do fade when the 10 seconds are up?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Laluni Songhammer </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
