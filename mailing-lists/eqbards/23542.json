The &quot;L#&quot; indicates the level that the reading was taken at.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here&#39;s the long answer...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two ways this spreadsheet generates numbers:<br/>\n1)  From formulas.<br/>\n2)  From tables.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning... if you wanted to know the effect of a song for <br/>\nyour level, you tested the song on yourself or a friend and looked at <br/>\nthe numbers.  Rokenn took it upon himself to encourage people to e-<br/>\nmail the numbers to him so he could collect a and post a master list <br/>\nof numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem with this system is that everyone said they would go take <br/>\nsome numbers, and then never did (I&#39;m guilty of this as well.)  As a <br/>\nresult, there are a lot of holes in the tables, or large ranges where <br/>\nno one actually calculated the numbers.  I had a choice of either <br/>\ntrying to interpolate the numbers, or just go with the last number <br/>\nknown.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThese days we know a lot more of the fomulas and although I know some <br/>\nof them are wrong, they&#39;re pretty close.  (They&#39;re only wrong by a <br/>\npoint or two.)  So with the last version I&#39;ve switched over to <br/>\nformulas because I&#39;d rather have a close approximation for my level, <br/>\nthan a value that&#39;s 20 levels beneath me.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, the 2nd page of the spreadsheet tries to explain this, but I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure how good of a job I did ;), and the 3rd page of the <br/>\nspreadsheet actually has the tables used.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: It&#39;s 40 points for a lute?  Good to know :)  Do you know if the <br/>\n40 points multiplied by the string instrumet bonus?  Thanks for your <br/>\nupdates and encouragement!<br/>\n<br/>\n  -  Reed Stormwind (Bard of E&#39;ci)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>, Reece Tom R CPT 25 ID L G4 <br/>\n&lt;g4mntofcr@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Reed,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Got another question for you.
