I am a level 25 Bard on the Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;server.  I have read with interest your emails, suggestions, and tips, but I<br/>\n&gt;seem to have a problem.  I can not use the same songs in the same way as<br/>\n&gt;you.  My sleep song puts EVERYONE but my party to sleep, including other<br/>\n&gt;players, in fact any NON Party song effects mobs and players.  This is a<br/>\n&gt;real disadvantage to me I believe.  Anyone on RZ with any suggestions? Or<br/>\n&gt;anyone else ?  Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry to say, Infiniti, but that&#39;s the primary disadvantage of Rallos Zek.<br/>\nYou have to recognize that spells are not intelligent and cannot<br/>\ndistinguish between people you &quot;kinda like&quot; and people you are neutral<br/>\ntowards.  Sad to say, this means that area-effect spells can be dangerous.<br/>\nThe only suggestion would be to a) never use them or b) warn people not to<br/>\nget near you.  Heck - that might even make camping easier for you, if all<br/>\nthe players who come near your group keep falling asleep *chuckles*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nCheck out the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
