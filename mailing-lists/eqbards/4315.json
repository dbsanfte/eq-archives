So,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1154946295\">I&#39;ve been trying to give my bard some method of magical attacks to<br/>\nsupplement his dissonance (I&#39;m currently level 11 -- can&#39;t wait until<br/>\nI get below).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  How much does dissonance with and without the lute/mandolin<br/>\n    at each level?  I&#39;ve heard 16 damage at level 30, but that<br/>\n    doesn&#39;t help when you&#39;re having a hard time getting up to<br/>\n    20 in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  I took the very long trip to Innothule and spent a few hours<br/>\n    killing frogloks for netted armor.  Now, mind you, I made a<br/>\n    pretty good profit selling all the rusty weapons I could haul<br/>\n    to Oasis, and I have an almost complete set of netted armor<br/>\n    to auction off.  But I thought that having netted gloves<br/>\n    (which are magical) would let me fight hand to hand against<br/>\n    magic-only monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Are there any weapons/armor out there that we can use as bards<br/>\n    to supplement our instrumental damage songs?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks in advance.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
