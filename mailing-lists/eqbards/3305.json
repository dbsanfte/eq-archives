I am<br/>\n&gt;regularly being hit for close to max damage, while my lower<br/>\n&gt;level friends in banded seem to be taking less.  The only one<br/>\n&gt;who seems to take more is my monk friend, who is 6 levels<br/>\n&gt;behind me and has woven/mesh (leather/chain equivalent for<br/>\n&gt;damage absorbtion).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>==========================<br/>\n<br/>\nAH! Thank you John!! At least now I know it&#39;s not just MY imagination on<br/>\nthis one. I was thinking the same thing, but was kinda afraid to admit it,<br/>\nfearing people would say I was just whining about something. I am usually,<br/>\nbecause of loot, within 5 or so points of my weight allowance (but not<br/>\nencumbered) and it seems like mobs NEVER miss me, ALWAYS do tremendous<br/>\ndamage, and I get stunned alot. The stunning part, as I HAVE &quot;whined&quot; about<br/>\nin other messages, REALLY has been getting to me as of late since it seems<br/>\nalmost every other hit &quot;stuns&quot; me for some reason. I was actually beginning<br/>\nto wonder if armor is worth anything, if I am going to be hit all the time<br/>\nand stunned half the time ANYWAY. (smile)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it is because we are so close to max weight. I will have to play with<br/>\nthat some, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTallonn Stringfellow - 34th verse<br/>\nBertox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
