Over the last three<br/>\ndays...hmmm...that means since the last patch...hmmmm...I have had problems<br/>\nreceiving /tells.  At least 6 different people have complained that they<br/>\nsent me /tells and I never responded.  One of them called me last nite and<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Hey!  wtf.  Are you pissed at me for some reason?&quot;  In total<br/>\nconsternation I asked him what he was talking about and he said he had been<br/>\nsending me /tells for the last 20 minutes and I hadn&#39;t answered a one.  I<br/>\nwas a city zone at the time so was actually not singing for a change except<br/>\nto Carillion various folks looking for new quests.  I was able to scroll<br/>\nback all the way to when I logged in and there were no /tells from him.<br/>\nThis was the 5th person in two days to complain that I was ignoring their<br/>\n/tells.  These are all people I play with all the time so the chance they<br/>\nmistyped something is nil.  Heck, I work with 3 of them.  I told my friend<br/>\nto send me another /tell as soon as he got off his phone.  I waited for 15<br/>\nminutes and never saw anything.  I think he gave up in disgust as it was<br/>\ngetting late, but he hasn&#39;t answered my email yet so I don&#39;t know for<br/>\ncertain.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else experienced any problems with this or am I the only one<br/>\n&#39;going deaf&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
