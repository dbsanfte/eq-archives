I used harmony (I&#39;m a L40 druid on Tribunal now, my bard on<br/>\ntarrew marr is on vacation) and was easily able to pull singles for a<br/>\nwhile. Unfortunately I had the bright idea of moving the fight<br/>\nunderwater so we could get used to underwater fighting for our planned<br/>\ntrip to Kedge. Also unfortunately, one of the people we&#39;d added to our<br/>\nregular group wandered (swam) a bit too close to the tower while we were<br/>\nfighting one I pulled and we got 4 on us. Everyone lived but me, who got<br/>\ncast on by 4 of them after healing our tank. But, it is doable. I think<br/>\njust our regular group of 4 40&#39;s could have done it if someone hadn&#39;t<br/>\nblundered into agro range. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; p.s. only other DW pull - a ranger swam into the cave and tried to pull.  He<br/>\n&gt; went LD.  His pal went down to cast EndureBreathe on him (not realizing that<br/>\n&gt; you cant cast/heal/buff LD players) and somehow he died - also LD. Oh well -<br/>\n&gt; back to something safe - killing Ogers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What level are the Ogres?
