Every<br/>\nsingle monster there can see invisible. In Lower Guk, Undead Frogs can now<br/>\nsee through Bard invis. Spiders and bats cannot, and neither can the live<br/>\nfrogluks. I am not sure whether Greater Iced Bones can or not, but I would<br/>\nrecommend having your cleric invis you to Undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe undead froggies could not see through bard invis last patch and it was<br/>\nchanged.The Undead in Unrest still cannot however. One good thing about Bard<br/>\ninvis in Unrest is that neither the living things (tentacle terrors, fungus)<br/>\nor the dead things (skeles and hags) can see through our invis. Anyone else<br/>\nneeds both invis and invis to undead, and a quick prayer that neither wear<br/>\noff to fast, since I don&#39;t believe any class has both. Yay bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things about bard invis - the higher you get, the less it blinks. I&#39;d<br/>\nsay mine has blinked maybe once in the last 4 hours of use (now at 195<br/>\nskill). Secondly, remember that if you go into auto-attack mode you<br/>\nimmediately become visible, so be careful when you are typing (ever try to<br/>\ntalk to an NPC and accidentally auto-attack him? I have).<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
