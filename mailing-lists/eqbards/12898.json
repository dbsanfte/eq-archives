If someone has<br/>\n  excellent points or a well thought out argument, it makes it nice<br/>\n  to see emphasis on key issues.  That said, i use _this_ as my style<br/>\n  of pulling a keyword out... but I do use it sparingly because in my<br/>\n  mind it&#39;s all in your wording not which word is emphasized.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Most discussions I&#39;ve seen that take a turn for the worse ends this <br/>\n  way, where the poster gets frustrated at attempting to explain their<br/>\n  thoughts on a matter in a logical way.  Often at that point, people<br/>\n  resort to trying to make others VERY aware of how &#39;they feel&#39; in the <br/>\n  facing or style of their language.  At any rate, I&#39;m a fairly calm <br/>\n  person who hates to seem like he&#39;s being YELLED at or &#39;talked down&#39; to.<br/>\n  Most of the time that is not the intention, but then again I only know<br/>\n  each of your through your choice of words in my e-mail window everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And as this is a free-to-post list, there&#39;s not much my opinion<br/>\n  on the matter counts.  It&#39;s just usenet and listserve courtesy<br/>\n  which I&#39;m accustom to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic ``Death Star&#39;&#39; Distortion.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
