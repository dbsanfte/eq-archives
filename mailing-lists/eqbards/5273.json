The staff usually fires 2-3 times<br/>\nper round for me..add it up...hmm 18 for bellow 48 for staff reg damage on<br/>\naxe averages 18..another 20 or so for the blunt damage from the staff..not<br/>\nbad for a bard AT ALL. On my server they can go for as much as 1000plat..or<br/>\nas little as a friends good wishes.  A wizard  friend of mine made a<br/>\ncreative deal for his..he agreed to port the person who gave him his<br/>\nanywhere for the entirety of a level whenever she asked!  If your level 32<br/>\nor up a trade of the mana song for a level or two might help......<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElyana Silvanae<br/>\nBardess of the 35th Chorus<br/>\nAmbassador to the Ridgerunners<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
