If THAT story is as bad as has been implied (I haven&#39;t<br/>\nread it) - I think that Verant has a case.  IMHO - the issue isn&#39;t so grey<br/>\nin dealing with that issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they thought they were banning the author of that<br/>\nstory - and after responding &quot;This is a private matter between Verant and<br/>\nthe Individual&quot; line - they didn&#39;t want to back off - even after realizing<br/>\nthe banned the wrong individual...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

The only action I can take, which is not play<br/>\nEQ and not pay them any more money.  Perhaps someone who enjoys doing this<br/>\nshould organize a protest this weekend.
