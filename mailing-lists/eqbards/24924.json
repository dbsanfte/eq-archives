Aria at the time had about 4 seconds of duration<br/>\nbeyond the pulse just enough to get you out of safty and into a long drop :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next batch which fixed that problem then made it that weapons would not<br/>\nproc while bard song was active.

Verant nerfed it by requiring it to completely end before<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; recasting.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This broke our levitate song.  The second and subsequent pulse of AOE (and<br/>\nI<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; assume Selo&#39;s Traveling - didn&#39;t have it then) wouldn&#39;t work until it ran<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; out and you fell.  The unlucky bards who found this out the hard way - and<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; used the song THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO WORK often fell to their death.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It was clear that Verant made a change to the spell system without doing<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ANY testing on the bard class.\tLiterally 19 seconds of testing<br/>\nwould have<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; caught this bug.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Similarly - they made a change to speed where Drums didn&#39;t add to the<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; affect of Selo&#39;s. Again - many bards died expecting their songs to work<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; they way they were designed (i.e. running away from mobs etc). In this<br/>\ncase<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; - 3 seconds of testing would have caught it. They admitted it was a bug -<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; but refused to fix it until the next patch went in.  They said it wasn&#39;t<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; critical enough (we were upset about this wondering the reaction from the<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; player base is SOW was broken...)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure other old-timers could probably come up with a half-dozen or more<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; bugs caused by changes to the spell system not intending to affect Bards<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; that were introduced into the live servers because the most trivial level<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; of testing the bard class wasn&#39;t done by Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Heck the Selo&#39;s speed bug was even discovered on Test by players and<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; reported to Verant - and they missed it...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Henrik Holm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEH@...\">HEH@...</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 10:01 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Selo and arie of eagles do not stack, this was a nessesary nerf because<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; bards would outrun guides and make fun of them.
