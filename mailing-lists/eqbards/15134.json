On most<br/>\nvideo cards though, you can tweak the gamma under the hardware<br/>\noptions.  Also, in your hardware configuration, if your<br/>\nmonitor model is one that Windows recognizes, I believe it<br/>\nalso does gamma correction.  Since you&#39;re playing a 3D game on<br/>\na laptop, I assume it&#39;s a Dell Inspiron 7500?  Right-click on<br/>\nthe desktop, select properties, then settings.  I could&#39;ve<br/>\nsworn there was a gamma slider on the one I saw.<br/>\n<br/>\nPCs are notoriously bad about gamma and have never had a<br/>\nstandard.  Macs and SGIs OTOH have always been gamma<br/>\ncalibrated.  One of the reasons they&#39;re still the preferred<br/>\nplatform for professional graphics and video work.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
