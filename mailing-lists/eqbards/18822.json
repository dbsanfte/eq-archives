Recover from interruption is entirely based<br/>\non the channeling skill, contrary to what most casters<br/>\nperceive.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note people have asked whether the dex makes<br/>\na difference in missed notes.  I do believe it does. <br/>\nI went even from 124 or so to 112 and feel like I&#39;ve<br/>\nnoticed a difference.  This could be all in my head as<br/>\nwell.  My missed notes, however, occur in bundles.  It<br/>\nis rarely one here and one there.  It is usually 3-5<br/>\nmissed notes all in a group.  Followed by relatively<br/>\nlong periods of no missed notes.  So I&#39;m thinking maby<br/>\nmy &quot;bundles&quot; just got bigger.  Maybe before I would<br/>\nhave 1-3 missed notes in a row and now it is 3-5.  <br/>\nJust a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n40th level bard, Black Tower<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 18 May 2000 14:55:41 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Kevin L.

Dex does nothing for speed.  All<br/>\n&gt; dex does is:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1)  Affects dmg for bows<br/>\n&gt; 2)  Affects dmg for thrown  (not told but determined<br/>\n&gt; through experience)<br/>\n&gt; 3)  Affects chance of crits/cripple<br/>\n&gt; 4)  Increases chance of a weapon processing it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; effect<br/>\n&gt; 5)  Decreases song missed note rate<br/>\n&gt; 6)  Helps casters recover from interruption<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thats it<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
