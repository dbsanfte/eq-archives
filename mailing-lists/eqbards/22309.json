I got a chance to talk<br/>\nto a couple of the live team folks and quized them on the changes to the<br/>\nJonthan&#39;s series.  If you have not heard they are removing the rune<br/>\ncomponent and making the song self only (like the level 7 Jonthan song).<br/>\nThey are also greatly buffing the haste, defense, and attack bonuses of the<br/>\nsong.  The goal, they said, was for these songs to allow bards to actually<br/>\n*tank*.  Should be interesting to see how they change.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Donny Dane [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddane01@...\">ddane01@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 06, 2000 11:41 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Has anyone else used these recently <br/>\n&gt; and noticed?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, had a chance to quiz GZ on the songs this weekend at <br/>\n&gt; eqfest 2000 in<br/>\n&gt; Houston, TX.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pixe and such, are being/have been changed, during the <br/>\n&gt; patches that are<br/>\n&gt; going live...he wasn&#39;t specific on it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; LULLABYE WILL BE CHANGED!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; GZ: &quot;Look for some VERY interesting things to be happening to <br/>\n&gt; Lullaby soon&quot;<br/>\n&gt; GZ: &quot;We have been thinking about bard mez, we didn&#39;t want <br/>\n&gt; them to infringe<br/>\n&gt; on the Enchanter role, as that is what Enchanters do best, <br/>\n&gt; BUT we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think that giving bards some mez abilities will hurt&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These are not exact quotes, but pretty close.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; MacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; p.s.
