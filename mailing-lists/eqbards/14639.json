The ghoul knights we were<br/>\nfighting usually either conned blue to me or red.  We had a druid in the<br/>\ngroup ensnaring so I weaved Largos Binding during combat.  My CHR was 130 at<br/>\nthe time and whenever we went up against a red ghoul, they resisted Largos<br/>\nfrequently.  Later on an enchanter joined the group and buffed my CHR to<br/>\n158.  From that point I was able to get Largos to stick on almost every red<br/>\nghoul we fought.  I didn&#39;t parse a log file so its all subjective, but it<br/>\nseemed that higher CHR made this song more effective.  I was under<br/>\nimpression higher CHR only increased our chance of success with mind control<br/>\nrelated songs like songs like Lullaby, Charm, Pixie and Fear.  Does anyone<br/>\nknow if higher CHR also effects Largos?  Its quite possible that the random<br/>\nnumber generator was skewed in my favor and thats why I was having better<br/>\nsuccess with the high CHR.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n34 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
