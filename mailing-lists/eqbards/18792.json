It would be a<br/>\njoke<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if it were on armor I could get at 28th level.  At 50+ it&#39;s extremely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; insulting.

How does this mesh with giving us<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapon that reduces our level on the hate list?  If we aren&#39;t a tank why<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should we need a weapon to reduce hate?
