I still have many songs to learn - but I&#39;m not as excited about any<br/>\nof them as much as I am my next one.. When I get to the 16th song, I&#39;m<br/>\ngrowing gills and becoming a fish. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what&#39;s in the lake in the West Commons anyway? Can you zone to/from the<br/>\nOcean Of Tears? Who needs a stinky boat - I&#39;m swimming from Freeport to<br/>\nButcherblock!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Did I ever mention the time I fell off the boat (or more acurately was<br/>\n*placed* off the boat from the bottom deck) and took my swimming skill from<br/>\na 3 to just over 30 (takes just over an hour for those of you interested)<br/>\nbecause I was too stubborn to let myself die and no GM&#39;s would answer me?<br/>\nThank goodness for the Jig keeping my stamina up..<br/>\n<br/>\nPSS: Does anyone else think that there should be a merchant or a bar in the<br/>\nboat? I&#39;d love to see some drunken Bards roaming around the deck.. playing<br/>\nsilly songs.. falling off.. trying to swim while drunk..<br/>\n<br/>\nPSSS: Does anyone else think it would be the greatest thing to have an<br/>\nundead ferryman that you had to give a copper or silver to in order to get<br/>\nacross the rivers around Antonica? Could even make it some Spectre type<br/>\nthing like the river Styx.. The things you think about while running nekkid<br/>\nfrom Freeport to Qeynos screaming Selo&#39;s eh?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
