I broke out of 45 last night (man that level stunk).  I am well<br/>\ninto my death buffer (got 2 bubs in an empty SolB last night due to lag, we<br/>\nheld all three King, Priest and Champ rooms), so I am raring up for planes.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few questions:  How do you get invited to go on Planes?  I only know like<br/>\n3 people who go to them regularly, and my guild is still at least a month<br/>\naway from being capable of doing it on our own.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny sites have a goodplanes guide I could read?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat songs seem to be the songs of choice there?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
