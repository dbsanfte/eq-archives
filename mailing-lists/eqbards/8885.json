How the heck do they miss this stuff?  Sounds like they either<br/>\n&gt;changed the faction hit for getting the ring, say from 5% to 100% (oops<br/>\n&gt;D&#39;Vinn coder, should been 10%) or they added a faction gain that puts the<br/>\n&gt;faction &#39;over the top&#39; thus turning it into a negative number.
