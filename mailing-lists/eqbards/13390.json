As of<br/>\nyesterday&#39;s patch, our surfing has been removed.  For me, that was one of<br/>\nthe neatest extra things about being a bard, with comments from friends all<br/>\nthe time saying that they loved it too.  I used to love watching myself run<br/>\nacross Norrath.  Now, when I run with selos and a drum, my legs move while<br/>\ndoing the drum animation, which looks horrible.  Its even worse if you are<br/>\nrunning with a wind/brass song going--the dance is canceled out, but you<br/>\nstill play the instrument.  I&#39;d rather have no instrument animation than<br/>\nthe mess they have made of it now.  I can&#39;t believe that they removed this<br/>\nafter almost a year of it-- imagine, wasting time on &quot;fixing&quot; this, while<br/>\nthere are things like ~deadly~ pathing bugs to worry about.  I petition&#39;ed<br/>\nand feedback&#39;ed the issue (even had a visit from a GM to observe), but am<br/>\ndoubtful that Verant even cares.<br/>\n<br/>\nElwe<br/>\n35 Songs<br/>\nBard of the Kinship of Valor<br/>\nKarana Server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
