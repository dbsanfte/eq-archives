This is what I was complaining about in the first place (in<br/>\nhind-sight - I am sorry for the minor flame-war that broke out - I guess I<br/>\nmisunderstood as much as I was misunderstood)..<br/>\n<br/>\n    The actions of Verant are - If you are a Bard or Necro - you are<br/>\nrequired to get someone to help you (levitate and gate).  But for other<br/>\nclasses they don&#39;t require you to get help.  If they were consistent - they<br/>\nwould tell all other classes to get a bard/necro (OR again - the Locate Rod)<br/>\nto retrieve the corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\n    On further thought - I suppose this isn&#39;t entirely reasonable - the<br/>\nbard/necro would actually have to loot the corpse for them - which is<br/>\nproblematic with the concerns of finding someone you can trust enough.  On<br/>\nthe other hand - they could put the Locate Rod for sale by nearby Vendor<br/>\nDruid...<br/>\n<br/>\n    But regardless - someone posted an email from a GM about how Verant<br/>\nwants to have consistent policies and avoid favoritism; but I think this<br/>\nsituation is exactly the opposite.  To be consistent; regardless of the<br/>\nabilities of you class - corpse retrieval in lava should be done the same<br/>\nfor all classes.  We&#39;re not talking trivial tasks here - it literally took<br/>\nme many hours (and three of my deaths and two of my druid friends deaths) to<br/>\nget my corpse back...<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay enough of a rant on this subject (your probably sick of it by now)...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 06, 1999 3:18 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard Handicap of Sorts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So if you aren&#39;t a bard/necro, the correct course of action<br/>\n&gt; would indeed be to get a GM or guide to retrieve the corpse<br/>\n&gt; for you.  If you are a bard/necro, then you have a way to loot<br/>\n&gt; your corpse so the GMs don&#39;t have to help you, which is what<br/>\n&gt; the original poster was griping about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unless I&#39;m remembering wrong and the /corpse command targets<br/>\n&gt; the corpse for you...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
