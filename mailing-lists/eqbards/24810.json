Take our twinks and<br/>\nkill Vox, with the understanding the raid is for soandso&#39;s white scale. <br/>\nPersonally, I have only done the music sheets part. I&#39;m checking on Phin<br/>\nregularly now as we&#39;ve killed him a couple times but no backbone so far. I<br/>\nstill need the skull from Karnors. I&#39;m told the warlord is camped pretty<br/>\nsolid. My cleric has an amy whip, so if multiquest doesn&#39;t get nerfed I&#39;m<br/>\ngood. Guild has a red scale for me they say and I have the metal bits. I do<br/>\nwonder what changed with the addition of the Undead bard that can spawn<br/>\nTrak. Forpar makes a lute neck and a body, but does he combine the 2 before<br/>\nyou get Trak guts now?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;sidhe<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
