Overall<br/>\nnewbies have it a lot easier now then I or anybody else ever did. A little<br/>\ntoughness to the game isn&#39;t going to hurt them at all. It&#39;s a lot easier to<br/>\nbuy equipment now as a newbie, it&#39;s a lot easier overall to play the game. I<br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t remember myself or other newbies asking for teleport&#39;s, now<br/>\nthat&#39;s a common site. People will get over it aventually and if worst comes<br/>\nto worst they can travel through Rathe Mountains.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, November 01, 1999 6:54 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Undead drops in Kithicor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Heh heh, except that on most servers there were 150+ people in Kithicor at<br/>\n&gt;the time.  Of course that still wasn&#39;t enough to prevent many deaths.  I<br/>\n&gt;agree that high level players desperately need an outdoor zone where they<br/>\n&gt;can adventure and gain xp and items and have fun.  If its Kithicor that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;cool, a pain in the butt to travel thru but that&#39;s life.  Why there are no<br/>\n&gt;high level outdoor zones I cannot say.  A high level zone with non-PoF high<br/>\n&gt;level mobs with big agro radii would be interesting.

It was good to see Verant<br/>\n&gt;&gt;making some real storyline related changes to a zone.  I just wish they<br/>\n&gt;&gt;could effectively do those sort of things at a lower level, say in the 25<br/>\n&gt;&gt;range instead of 40.  Problem is, all those 40+ level characters would<br/>\n&gt;flood<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the zone anyway just to kill everything to see what it dropped, depriving<br/>\n&gt;&gt;people of an appropriate level from participating.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;ll be really surprised if Asheron&#39;s Call is much of a threat to EQ.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;what I saw in Beta it was no match for EQ despite the problems in EQ.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;There were some really sweet weapons a bard could use on some of those<br/>\n&gt;&gt;undead apparently.  sadly I was unable to get any even though most of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;people I saw fighting them would have zero use for them.  Its a bit<br/>\n&gt;&gt;irritating to watch a 50th level paladin scooping up no drop piercing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;weapons.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Kitasi<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: Kevin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wethington@...\">wethington@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Sent: Tuesday, November 02, 1999 1:33 PM<br/>\n&gt;&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Undead drops in Kithicor<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Kevin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wethington@...\">wethington@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Methinks you are being a bit harsh on Verant.
