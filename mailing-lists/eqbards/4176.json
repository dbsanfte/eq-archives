It was<br/>\nrather funny, the lower level players loved it all. They&#39;d pick off the<br/>\nrunners and even meditate at my feet as they felt safe.  If Dvinn wasnt<br/>\ncamped so much i&#39;d go charm him to kill crush. But all in all fear is a<br/>\ngreat song. Saved my party&#39;s butt 2 times in the tower of unrest the other<br/>\nnight when we pulled too much. The too much became easy though once we<br/>\nfeared em as it gave the cleric time to heal us so we&#39;d be ready for another<br/>\nround when they&#39;d run back.  Funny enough about 4 minutes after that fight<br/>\nor so, the hand runs into the room and beelines for guess who, the lil ol<br/>\nbard.  Was icing on the cake 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy party is constantly telling me not to play that song anywhere, but when<br/>\nour resident tank gets in trouble or something, they beg me to play it, go<br/>\nfigure. Wish they&#39;d make up their mind on such a funny song<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin Nehoc<br/>\nBard of the 27th chorus<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tRokenn Swiftsong [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, July 22, 1999 3:57 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQBards@onelist.com\">EQBards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] Had fun with my new song last night<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night I made 26th level and got to play with the Appalling Screech.  <br/>\n&gt; Man what a fun song!  My party was in Solesek&#39;s Eye and was about to<br/>\n&gt; leave, <br/>\n&gt; no one else was in the zone so I decided to see how big a train I could <br/>\n&gt; start with this song.  By the time I left I had over a dozen gobs bouncing<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; off me, fleeing in terror!  Then on my way out I came across 3 DE guards<br/>\n&gt; at <br/>\n&gt; the zone to EC, so I feared them to, then shouted to the zone that their <br/>\n&gt; (the Dark Elves) guards were fleeing in terror from a lone bard, haha.<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; love being a Bard :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n&gt; Master Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\n&gt; Amerginn - Test server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out homepage for details.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
