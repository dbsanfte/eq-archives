Don&#39;t worry Harm some of can sympathize with your frustration easily.<br/>\nBelieve me I work in the software development profession, have for 10+ years<br/>\nfor 3 different companies.  If at any of them we behaved as Verant does we&#39;d<br/>\nhave lost our jobs, period.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure its laziness though.  Its more like arrogance from what I see.<br/>\nWe should all just fell damn lucky to be allowed to play &#39;their&#39; game.<br/>\n(whew, almost used caps but restrained myself).  Their general opinion seems<br/>\nto be if &#39;they&#39; don&#39;t like it to bad.  If &#39;we&#39; don&#39;t like it we will fix it.<br/>\nDespite Gordon&#39;s claims to the contrary this is still their opinion, he&#39;s<br/>\njust better at hiding it.  Semantically, he&#39;s a better liar than Brad and<br/>\nSmed.  GZ I think is just too focused on what he likes to really notice the<br/>\nother stuff.  Hence Necros get more abilities, new spells, new spells for<br/>\ntheir pets.  I though not adding much to a group was a, to quote Abashi,<br/>\n&quot;price that had to be paid for being so good in another area&quot;, ie. soloing.<br/>\nApparently that does not apply to casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask you this.  If all the caster classes were suddenly removed from the<br/>\ngame would it still be playable at all?  I think not.  Removing all the<br/>\nhybrid and melee classes on the other hand would make the game much harder,<br/>\nand maybe make some mobs impossible, but otherwise the game would still be<br/>\nplayable.  To me that on fact is the ultimate statement of proof that the<br/>\nclasses are absolutely not balanced.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 03, 2000 2:27 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Harmonic&#39;s Super Rant Session (OT, very long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Job well done Harmonic, again!
