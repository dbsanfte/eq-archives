I&#39;m wondering what the advantages of this over using the standards spell slots along the top side of the screen.  Is it just personal preference - or is there in fact an advantage?  Maybe its just habits.  I didn&#39;t know about the quick-keys doing anything but holding &quot;abilities&quot; until about level 8 and got used to clicking songs in the above slots...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde of Xegony<br/>\n&gt; Level 18<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 18<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 6 Jul 1999 09:34:52 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Brendan Daly &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samidaly@...\">samidaly@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Quick Keys/Songs<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The advantage is in twisting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Instead of moving the mouse and clicking - esp hard during some mage<br/>\n&gt; spells due to screen saturation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You just hit a number key -<br/>\n&gt; when I twist I have say - Antham on #3 Bellow #5 and protection #2<br/>\n&gt; it goes something like this<br/>\n&gt; hit 3 - wait for 5 secs - see the blue text<br/>\n&gt; hit 5 hit 5 - wait 5 secs - see the blue text<br/>\n&gt; hit 2 hit 2 - wait 5 secs - see the blue text<br/>\n&gt; hit 3 hit 3 ....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You get the timing down after only a couple battles, you stop even<br/>\n&gt; having to see the text saying your song is in effect. --- WAY better<br/>\n&gt; than mouse clicking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Samiba Craftsman<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 21<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 6 Jul 1999 13:32:23 -0400 (EDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Quick Keys/Songs<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 6 Jul 1999, Brendan Daly wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The advantage is in twisting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Instead of moving the mouse and clicking - esp hard during some mage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells due to screen saturation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone *not* have this problem?  My system is pretty high<br/>\n&gt; end (Celeron 450, 128MB RAM, Voodoo 3 card) and ever since I<br/>\n&gt; got the extra lights at L24, unless I turn particle density<br/>\n&gt; off (meaning I don&#39;t see spell effects like root at all), I go<br/>\n&gt; from twisting 3 songs easily to barely twisting 2.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; thinking of changing my video card because a friend with a<br/>\n&gt; Riva TNT said it wasn&#39;t that bad on her system (same CPU<br/>\n&gt; speed, RAM).  Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>\n&gt; with lots of spells flying?  What video card do you use?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The thing that really irks me about this is that it&#39;s a client<br/>\n&gt; side problem.  The determination that &quot;you haven&#39;t yet<br/>\n&gt; recovered&quot; to sing another song is completely client side, and<br/>\n&gt; completely dependent on the speed of your system.  When I had<br/>\n&gt; a P200 with a Voodoo 1, it took ages for the song buttons to<br/>\n&gt; un-grey when I stopped singing.  When I upgraded to my current<br/>\n&gt; system, it was almost instant, except as noted above when lots<br/>\n&gt; of spells are flying.  I would prefer to be able to turn off<br/>\n&gt; the button un-grey animation sequence and suffer a flat time<br/>\n&gt; delay which doesn&#39;t change with CPU speed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
