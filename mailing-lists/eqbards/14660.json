So I said what they were, from where, and the stats.  And this<br/>\nyoung bard floored me by saying he was amazed that I took the time to answer, let<br/>\nalone volunteer information.  I was shocked to find out from him that &#39;high levels&#39;<br/>\nsometimes completely ignore and sometimes are rude to people who contact them.  I<br/>\nguess I was pretty lucky picking the high level bards I bugged at a young age<br/>\n(mostly it was Rynn Shada).<br/>\n<br/>\n[An aside to the water/food purchase - I have started foraging again the last two<br/>\nlevels.  I can feed myself but water is just too rare to be enough.]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe twist to the story: this little level 4 bard is also a level 50 paladin I know<br/>\npretty well.  I like to think I inspired him to start a bard haha (hey it&#39;s fun to<br/>\nthink so ;P).<br/>\n<br/>\nI completely agree with Harmonic; I like to just be nice to people.  It isn&#39;t really<br/>\nselfless at all - it pays off in so many ways =).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n //Maravana Vireo<br/>\n //Level 49 Bard (halfway through, and still slogging along!  probably by the<br/>\nweekend yay)<br/>\n //Jus Divinum www.jusdivinum.com<br/>\n //Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
