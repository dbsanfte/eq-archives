Str is of primary importance at lvls 6-15 maybe, but after it<br/>\ndiminishes rapidly in favor of other area like agility, dexterity, and<br/>\ncharisma.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Our hand to hand caps pretty low anyway, so don&#39;t ever think you&#39;re gonna<br/>\n&gt;do much more than scratch a mob with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very true, another sore point with many bards.  Doing a bit of everything<br/>\nand nothing well can mean having a very difficult time as you go on in less<br/>\nthan a full group (or close).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Here is one tip tho - you can tank in a pinch, but after awhile - you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;soon come to realize bards are NOT tanks, no matter how much some may wish<br/>\n&gt;they were.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A truer point probably could not be made.  Especially considering Verant is<br/>\namong those who think we are a tank by virtue of being a hybrid.  Verant&#39;s<br/>\nconcept of a hybrid was initially &quot;A primarily melee class with some spell<br/>\nabilities like Paladins, Rangers, Shadowknights, and Bards&quot; according to an<br/>\nold press piece.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
