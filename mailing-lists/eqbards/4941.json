They could many months ago, but a <br/>\npatch changed that.  A druid CAN heal a monster but only under certain <br/>\nspecial condition.  The monster has to be of anmimal type so the druid can <br/>\ncharm it.  A druid can heal his pet.  But in your case, the monster is <br/>\nhitting you, so the monster wasn&#39;t a pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your druid friend was telling you the truth, well at least the part <br/>\nabout some other healer type MOB nearby is healing your target.  Shaman type <br/>\nMOB will heal his friends even though the fight was not close enough to draw <br/>\nits attack.  As for his heal is not very good, it could be true.  Druid only <br/>\ngets an upgrade of heal spell every 2 ranks. So maybe he was just a few <br/>\nlevel short of getting his next upgrade and his previous heal spell (8 or 9 <br/>\nlevels ago) cannot keep up with the damage you are taking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Mr. Beeba&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:flpmc@...\">flpmc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      One question...can<br/>\n&gt;druids, clerics, etc., or<br/>\n&gt;those that heal, heal monsters<br/>\n&gt;that they are fighting if they<br/>\n&gt;have the monster targeted?  I<br/>\n&gt;have never played a healer<br/>\n&gt;type and was wondering if this<br/>\n&gt;was the case.  Yesterday in<br/>\n&gt;Permafrost I was grouped with<br/>\n&gt;a druid that was supposed to<br/>\n&gt;be healing me when I was<br/>\n&gt;getting hurt, but for some<br/>\n&gt;reason every time I asked for<br/>\n&gt;a heal, the monster would get<br/>\n&gt;more health and mine would<br/>\n&gt;still go down.  The druids<br/>\n&gt;explanation was that there<br/>\n&gt;were other monsters of its<br/>\n&gt;race healing it and the reason<br/>\n&gt;mine was not healing fast is<br/>\n&gt;because his heal did not work<br/>\n&gt;very well.  Needless to say I<br/>\n&gt;died and quickly ungrouped<br/>\n&gt;from this person.  So is what<br/>\n&gt;the druid said true?  Or am I<br/>\n&gt;correct in my assumption that<br/>\n&gt;the druid was healing the<br/>\n&gt;monsters?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tadian of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
