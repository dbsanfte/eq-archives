This has two effects.  First, of<br/>\ncourse, is that is puts most of the mobs to sleep so that they&#39;re not doing<br/>\ndamage to anyone.  This gives my casting group a nice luxurious time in which<br/>\nto cast their spells.  Second, and just as important, it tends to pull the<br/>\nmobs off of them and onto me.  Since I&#39;m much more of a tank than any of the<br/>\npure casting classes this is usually a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make a comment about another message I read regarding lullaby, at level 20<br/>\nand 21 I have definitely noticed that using the Lute (or my weightless<br/>\nmandolin in my case) definitely does improve lullaby.  It seems to nod more<br/>\nmobs longer than without.  Not a HUGE difference, but noticable at 21st.  So<br/>\nwhen I absolutely MUST get the crowd under control and keep them there for a<br/>\ncouple of minutes while my tanks take out four or five mobs on after another,<br/>\nI always equip my mandolin.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 21st song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.

It<br/>\n&gt; does *not* clear the hate list, but it does make them hate you<br/>\n&gt; more rather quickly, which is ok since we&#39;re decent tanks.<br/>\n&gt; While they&#39;re nodding, they&#39;re not interrupting the caster&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; spells, so your friends will be able to cast more reliably.<br/>\n&gt; My cleric friend loves this song because without it in<br/>\n&gt; multiple mob situations, the unengaged mobs tend to jump on<br/>\n&gt; the her after she heals anyone.  She says if that happens, she<br/>\n&gt; just stands next to me for a few pulses and the mobs start<br/>\n&gt; attacking me again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
