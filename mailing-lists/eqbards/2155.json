Seems we do have quite a few Bards on this list.  I&#39;ve found EQ<br/>\n&gt;extremely addictive as well so keep the info flowing.  My character isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;power hungry or camp hungry like many of the players I&#39;ve seen lately.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;much more into the part of being a bard and enjoying the fantasty world.  I<br/>\n&gt;detest the idea of hanging out waiting for things to respawn for you to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>kill<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and then wait to kill again.  I really think EQ needs a rogue band of camp<br/>\n&gt;killers to go around and whack on people if they&#39;ve been sitting there for<br/>\n&gt;too long.  I do think we bards get left out sometimes though.  I think we<br/>\n&gt;need to have a concert or something, maybe a Bard-alapooza or show.  Gather<br/>\n&gt;the bards together and sing baby sing!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Gediprime, of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Friday, June 18, 1999 12:05 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Spoilers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; At 12:52 PM 6/18/99 -0400, John Robertson wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Spoilers below... though not many.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It is good that those supplying information some will consider spoilers<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should give such warning.
