If so, here is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the information on the virus:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vil.mcafee.com/dispVirus.asp?virus_k=10003\">http://vil.mcafee.com/dispVirus.asp?virus_k=10003</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now, I say &quot;may&quot; because it&#39;s possible that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; infected file came from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; patch center.

Of course, you should always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a virus scanner<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running (says the guy without one) and never open<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything from someone you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know and/or trust (yadda yadda).
