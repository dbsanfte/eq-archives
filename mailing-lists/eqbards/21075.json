But do you truly believe that for the past, lets say three<br/>\nor four months (by which time this bug has &quot;aged&quot; long enough for my comment<br/>\nto be valid) - every item addressed by the testing department has been those<br/>\ntype of serious problems?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly - it seems that there are only one or two testers for the Live<br/>\nteam.  IMHO this is woefully inadequate.  Doesn&#39;t Verant say they have<br/>\napprox 300,000 subscribers?  Three million dollars a month revenue only buys<br/>\nus two testers?  I hope there are more testers quietly working away out of<br/>\nthe spotlight...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - I do believe that we need to have a certain amount of &quot;Squeaky<br/>\nWheel&quot; mentality.  Albeit politely, and no flames.  I do believe I worded my<br/>\ncomments in a &quot;non-whining&quot; manner. We&#39;ve been quietly, patiently waiting<br/>\nfor this issue to be addressed - I don&#39;t want to see it pushed to the<br/>\nbackburner.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly - since I made my post this morning - I found this thread from the<br/>\nConcert Hall<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=4864.to\">http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=4864.to</a><br/>\npic<br/>\nreferring to Official Board post<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/001020.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/001020.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you saw that when you made this comment - I hadn&#39;t seen it until<br/>\nafter I saw your comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that the &quot;higher priority&quot; duping problem Abashi was talking about<br/>\nwas the programmer assisting Ester - not Ester&#39;s testing of the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading the threads above - I AM worried that the testing being done (so far<br/>\nat least) if they&#39;re testing in Qenyos Hills - they may be testing low level<br/>\nBard on Low Level mobs.  We KNOW the problem with Lullaby doesn&#39;t arise<br/>\nuntil higher levels.  I sure hope they are also testing with different<br/>\nlevels of charisma.<br/>\n<br/>\nCall me paranoid - but with the recent announcement on Chains - I fear they<br/>\nwill announce Bard Mez works fine - case closed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that&#39;s not the case.  While Chains is seriously less effective than<br/>\nit use to be - it&#39;s not worthless.  There are circumstances where it&#39;s an<br/>\nokay song.  But past the mid 20&#39;s or so - Lullaby is completely useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried Pixie Strike recently - and it too did more harm than good.  I guess<br/>\nit has some use to try to interrupt casters - but otherwise is also<br/>\nuseless...<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.
