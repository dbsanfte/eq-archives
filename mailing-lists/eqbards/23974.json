What&#39;s the percentage of people who go into Veeshans<br/>\nPeak or Sleepers Tomb?  Does that mean that those zones are insignificant?<br/>\nNot for the people who do go into them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy argument still stands.  It is pretty narrow minded to say that &#39;&#39;those people<br/>\nare a small minority and thus don&#39;t matter&#39;&#39;.  It is pretty easy to say when you aren&#39;t<br/>\non of &#39;&#39;those people&#39;&#39;.  Like I said before, bards are less than 5% of the total peak<br/>\npopulations on servers, yet, because you are one of them, they aren&#39;t one of &#39;&#39;very,<br/>\nvery, very, tiny minority&#39;&#39;, that you find it easy to call other folks?<br/>\n<br/>\nnote:  I decided to take your advice and go to eqvault and see how many players were<br/>\nplaying pvp vs regular.  Even counting test and chat as part of the total, the number<br/>\nof players on pvp were 6.92152% of the total number of players on line currently.  Slightly<br/>\nmore than your 5% number.  Almost double the percentage of bards playing on peak<br/>\non xegony.  So now who is the very very very tiny minority???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:34 AM 2/26/01 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Only a fool would make the argument that all bards are posted here.  That is<br/>\n&gt;so totally ludicrous as to almost be unanswerable if it were not so<br/>\n&gt;offensive.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone can see that there are three pvp servers, each on the lower end of<br/>\n&gt;the population base and easily determine how many people at any one time are<br/>\n&gt;playing in a potential pvp environment.  Even if those people were all<br/>\n&gt;playing pvp all the time and never playing pve, their number would still be<br/>\n&gt;insignificant compared to the overall number of players.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Get a clue, this is NOT a pvp game except for a very, very, very, tiny<br/>\n&gt;minority. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
