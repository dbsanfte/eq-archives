I can understand bugging guildmates or<br/>\n&gt; friends for stuff but i would never go up to someone and start nagging for<br/>\n&gt; stuff. So my friend got tired of being bugged by this newbie ranger, went to<br/>\n&gt; the bank, got 13000 coppers and led the newbie far from the banker, gave him<br/>\n&gt; all the coppers and then walked away, the newbie didnt know what to do, he<br/>\n&gt; couldnt move and didnt know how to destroy it hehe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes life is good and generosity pays off<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minkin<br/>\n&gt; Sol Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
