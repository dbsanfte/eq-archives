At<br/>\nlevel 57, these are the ones I haven&#39;t used at all in the last 2<br/>\nmonths.  Maybe somebody has some bright ideas on some of them!<br/>\n<br/>\n3 - Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39;Vigor:  Cantana does enough.<br/>\n6 - Hymn of Restoration:  I can&#39;t figure out what it stacks with.<br/>\n7 - Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong:  Later versions are better?<br/>\n10 - Anthem de Arms:  VoV better?<br/>\n12 - Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow:  Heh<br/>\n15 - Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby:  Well, I did mem it to check it out.  Heh<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n20 - Cassindra&#39;s Chant of Clarity:  I&#39;ve got better.<br/>\n24 - Lyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord:  We&#39;ve had this discussion  :)<br/>\n28 - Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike:  53 is plenty good enough<br/>\n34 - Cantana of Soothing:  I&#39;ve got better.<br/>\n35 - Denon&#39;s Dissension:  Now, really, isn&#39;t THIS worthless?<br/>\n36 - Vilia&#39;s Verses of Celerity:  I&#39;ve got better.<br/>\n42 - McVaxius&#39; Berserker Crescendo:  Someone find a stackable use for<br/>\nthis?<br/>\n50 - Melody of Ervaj:  I&#39;ve never been in a party where this would be<br/>\nuseful.<br/>\n53 - Song of Dawn:  Reducing aggro on secondary MOBs doesn&#39;t help when<br/>\nyou&#39;re the only one on the list.  Primary MOBs are easy to ditch.  Plus,<br/>\nI can just wait for the Cleric to heal me, now.<br/>\n56 - Song of Highsun:  Well, I&#39;ve memmed it, but it&#39;s always nighttime.<br/>\n56 - Song of Midnight:  Well, I&#39;ve memmed it, but it&#39;s always daytime.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, a pretty short list, if you think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
