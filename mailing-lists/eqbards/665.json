Figuring it out is the<br/>\nfun of playing a bard.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Switched to an old standby instead..Lucid Lullaby.

Lullaby does an<br/>\n&gt; excellent job interupting the casters.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another use I found for Lullaby is saving your party when a<br/>\nhopelessly red train gets dumped on it.  The song *really*<br/>\npisses off the monsters, so you fire it up until you have<br/>\ntheir attention, then hit accelerando and lead them away from<br/>\nyour party.<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard the maximum number of mobs affected by it was limited<br/>\nto 4 for playbalance reasons.  I have no problem with that,<br/>\nbut it seems to me that even when the song is already working<br/>\non 4 mobs, it still gets other mobs nearby (who are not being<br/>\naffected by the song and are normally non-aggressive) mad at<br/>\nme.  It&#39;s hard to keep calm when 4 mobs are beating on you and<br/>\n3 more join the fray, so I can&#39;t say I&#39;m certain about this.  <br/>\nBut that&#39;s the impression I&#39;m getting of how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
