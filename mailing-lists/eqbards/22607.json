This will allow more skill checks, allowing you to increase<br/>\nthe skill faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the skill is maxed you want to have your fastest weapon in your<br/>\nprimary(for the primary hand bonus) and your best ratio weapon in in your<br/>\nsecondary.  Another thing to consider is procing weapons.  If you have a<br/>\nweapon with an excellent proc, or a proc that you need to maximize the<br/>\nchance of it going off, place that weapon in your primary.  For example when<br/>\nI want to make sure I get a proc off my Orb of Tashan I will wield it in<br/>\nprimary, even though I have faster/better weapons I normally use in primary.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly you have to consider how the weapons look, we are bards after all.<br/>\nPersonally my main weapons are now a sainy&#39;s claw (EBW look) and the Skean<br/>\n(from the rogue epic weapon quest).  I had a partisan but gave it away as it<br/>\nwas too ugly :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing on the Skean, I am deathly afraid it is going to get nerfed.  I<br/>\nhave had stun procs last as long as 8 secs!  Once I get my SSS I think I<br/>\nwill be pretty happy with my weapons for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Legba Work [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 20, 2000 6:39 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Dual wielding question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even by lvl 20 your chance of interuping a caster with a <br/>\n&gt; single hit is real<br/>\n&gt; small (non PVP).
