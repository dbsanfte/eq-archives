So even if you&#39;re first in line for<br/>\nall bard armor, you&#39;ll have to see 18 drops on average before<br/>\nyou have a full set (well, only one bracer, but most people<br/>\nopt to substitute a hero or lambent for their second bracer).  <br/>\nSeeing as the drop rate seems to average less than one per<br/>\ntrip, and you&#39;re talking about a long long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; twice as often as anything else.

But they screwed up and tuned the armor drops on a<br/>\n&quot;new pieces added per game day&quot; basis.  Because the respawn in<br/>\nHate is faster than Fear, that means the &quot;armor drop per<br/>\nplayer-hour&quot; for Hate is much lower than for Fear.  So folks<br/>\nwith Fear armor go there, clear it over 5+ hours, then go on<br/>\nto do other stuff (like sleep or play elsewhere) for the rest<br/>\nof their time.  But for folks with Hate armor would have to<br/>\ncamp Hate 24 hours straight (due to the respawning wanderers)<br/>\nto have the same shot at their armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the right choice from a world-balance standpoint, but<br/>\nreally screwed up for classes with Hate armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
