Found a<br/>\ncave and after our pally gave the skelly something we killed this other guy<br/>\nMiragul (sp?) something to help our pally do some kinda quest.  After that,<br/>\nwe went up to the Plane of Sky and started working on getting to I4  - guess<br/>\nhis quest is up there.  I forgot to try charm on the Sky Princess but soon<br/>\nenough had a go at an azarack.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe and Suladan (48 bard) tried to charm aza&#39;s.  100% resist. 100% taunt.<br/>\n100% dead.  Meanwhile, a lev 50 enchanter stuck mez on one so looks like the<br/>\nbard uber-charm is gone but aza&#39;s are now mezz-able.  Things were kinda<br/>\nscattered and we shoulda done better clearing azaracks as we have cleared em<br/>\nin one pass before but this time we fought until we were all dead.  Anyhow,<br/>\nwe were staging in Gfay for CorpseRecovery when the freaking GM event starts<br/>\nup and soon  180, 190, 200 ppl are in the zone.  Then 205, 210 and at<br/>\n215.....<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have been disconnected.<br/>\n<br/>\nLogin and find songs unmemmed due to restoring to a previous save. Then,<br/>\ndisconnected.  Re-log, rinse, repeat. This goes on for way too long and<br/>\nfinally it dawns on us to run to Lfay.  We CR and clear the rest of the<br/>\naza&#39;s.  Then its 3 hours longer than I should have stayed and I jumped off.<br/>\nRead this morning that one of our druids has stuff to complete a quest -<br/>\nmight be a first for our server.  What a night - ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Daniel P.
