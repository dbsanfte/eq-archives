It really<br/>\ncomes in handy when you start to get into trouble in a fight and you can<br/>\ntwist Hymn with Chant of Battle or Jonathon&#39;s Whistling Warsong. Now that<br/>\nyou have Boastful Bellow, you really need to start twisting that with Anthem<br/>\nDe Arms or Hymn, whichever the situation. Start out twisting Bellow with<br/>\nAnthem, then if your hitpoints start getting low, twist Bellow with Hymn,<br/>\nand throw Anthem in there just for good measure if you can.<br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;ll try pottery to make some extra money. I&#39;ve been doing brewing for<br/>\nawhile, and that you can maybe make 5-10pp in an hour, and it gets very<br/>\ntedious. Its not really practical for me to go to Halas right now, I&#39;m in<br/>\nFreeport. Where is a good place to do pottery on the eastern coast of<br/>\nAntonica or anywhere on Faydwer? Also, where can I get the book on pottery?<br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\n´┐¢Tanthalias<br/>\n´┐¢Half Elven Bard, 12th Circle<br/>\n´┐¢Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
