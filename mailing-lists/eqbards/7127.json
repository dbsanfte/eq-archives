I have been in several<br/>\ngroups there fighting for the last 3-4 nights.  While I have never grouped<br/>\nwith a bard while there, I have paired up (fighting in a group of 2) with<br/>\nseveral different classes.  Namely, A Druid, A Shaman, A Paladin, A Ranger,<br/>\nand a Necromancer.  In each of these cases I have had a problem that I as a<br/>\nbard have never run into.  I was unable to taunt Aviaks off my partner.  For<br/>\nonce I would be the one ending battle with most of my health, while my<br/>\npartner was near death.  This is nice but unsetteling.  Even with Lullabye I<br/>\nwould have a terrible time trying to get my share of dammage.  I think that<br/>\nsome of this is because at 20th level I am getting a lot of resists from<br/>\nDarters and Rooks.  But it cant be just that.  So I think that there is some<br/>\nother reason that Im not getting mobed as much.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a seperate note,  I did group with 2 other bards in unrest once.  WOW...<br/>\nthat was cool, and I can attribute not getting all the attention, due to<br/>\nmultiple bards.  What fun.  If we had one more bard we could have been the<br/>\nBeatles :)  I also dont think I have ever seen Sooo many icons for Buffs on<br/>\nmy screen :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin Tercet 20th Human Bard<br/>\non Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 23, 1999 11:25 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] The surefire way for a bard to avoid being a mobs<br/>\nmain target<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, at the suggestion of a few people from this list, I ventured for<br/>\nthe first time to South Karana to hunt aviaks.  I had been in South Karana<br/>\nbefore to complete the Qeynos bard quest but had never fought anything<br/>\nthere.  I joined a group that consisted of five 28th level players, four of<br/>\nwhich were casters.  The fifth person was a 28th level bard (Cherlas).  To<br/>\navoid overlapping songs in combat, we agreed that she would sing the level<br/>\n25-28 songs while I would sing anthem, chain, and anything else appropriate.<br/>\nWe were camping at the top of the village where avocets, harriers, rooks,<br/>\nand darters all spawn (very quickly).  I fought with this group for almost<br/>\ntwo hours.  Me and the other bard were the default tanks.  For the first<br/>\ntime in a long time, I was no longer the center of attention.  In almost<br/>\nevery fight, the 28th level bard would pull and get the aviaks initial<br/>\nattention.  When one of the casters unloaded on the aviak, they often found<br/>\nthemselves the center of attention.  I, on the other hand, almost never got<br/>\nattacked the entire night.  The most health I ever dropped to was about 50%.<br/>\nThis happened when an avocet spawned while we were in the process of<br/>\nfighting a rook and a harrier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMoral of the story: Two bards in a group can be lots of fun.  The lower<br/>\nlevel bard also has the luxury of not having to worry too much about getting<br/>\ncontinually whacked on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n23 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
