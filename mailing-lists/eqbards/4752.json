The first my<br/>\nfriends and I got was a screaming mace, which is quite an<br/>\nundertaking to obtain.  So while the damage on the water and<br/>\nslime crystal staves is nothing spectacular (5/28), they are<br/>\ngood weapons to pull out every couple levels to top off your<br/>\n1h-blunt skill.  The *optimal* 1h blunt bard weapon to do this<br/>\npast about level 20 would probably be a cold iron morningstar<br/>\n(9/38? 9/35? and 4.5 lbs), but it&#39;s a rare drop.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
