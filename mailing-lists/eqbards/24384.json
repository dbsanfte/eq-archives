Key thing is to put it in trade window and wait for the<br/>\nsong to re-pulse and check your con before hitting trade - make sure you are<br/>\nback to indiff before you trade.  Now, that happened a long time ago - they<br/>\nmay have made changes to invis while questing.  But you should be able to<br/>\ninvis to get behind him and away from the other agro froogs in the room.<br/>\nThen get a successful sneak going - which you can do while invis.  Then hand<br/>\nitem, check con and trade if and only if con is indiff or better.  Not sure<br/>\nwhat faction song would do for you (ie: is he threatening or scowling to<br/>\nstart with?).<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nThe Pantheon<br/>\nTroubador, somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Matt DeBarger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 03, 2001 8:35 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] HS Key<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally got my xalgoz fang (4th attempt).
