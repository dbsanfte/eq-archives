Would these be good for dual wielding, or should <br/>\n&gt; I look into getting something else?  Bear in mind, I&#39;m only <br/>\n&gt; 15-17th level and NOT that rich anymore.  (Spent way too much <br/>\n&gt; of it on armor for myself and friends.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anything you guys can suggest, advice, pass on will be <br/>\n&gt; greatly appreciated.
