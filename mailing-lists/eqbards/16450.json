An afterthought that&#39;s nice<br/>\n&gt; to have when the real spells fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I get a strong idea that GZ&#39;s well ran dry on song ideas somewhere just<br/>\nafter L20. Chains could have been a great song if it was _only_ a<br/>\ntargetted mob combat speed reducer. That way it wouldn&#39;t conflict with<br/>\nsnare and cause these headaches. Then he could have added another snare<br/>\nsong as a seperate song, for those occasions when you don&#39;t have a druid<br/>\nor ranger. But no, GZ seems real big on these multiple action songs that<br/>\nget resisted more and also conflict more with other class&#39;s spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with the magic resist debuffs. A straight debuff would have been<br/>\nfine, but he had to add the dot which uses the same resist, so the songs<br/>\nbecome effectively useless. Having magic, fire, and cold debuff songs<br/>\nthat tested on poison like tashan wouldn&#39;t have been that unbalancing or<br/>\nintruding on the classes that get debuffs, considering how little they<br/>\ndebuff and the level the bard gets them at, but instead we got 3 songs<br/>\nthat no one ever uses.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
