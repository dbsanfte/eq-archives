The answer I got was &quot;yes, what&#39;s it for?&quot;, to which I<br/>\nreplied a Bardic equipment quest.  Well as it turns out it was not the<br/>\nguildmate that had foraged it, it was a Guide on our server that had.  [This<br/>\nGuide is a really colorful and likeable gnome that frequently pops into<br/>\nHate, Sky, etc. and runs around entertaining us.]  The Guide apparently<br/>\nasked our guildmates who had been nearby if they knew what the heck a<br/>\nBurynai Bundt Cake was for.  I haven&#39;t seen the Guide online recently, but<br/>\nif/when I do I&#39;ll try and squeeze some info out of him about his forage<br/>\nskill and where he might have foraged such a thing.  Unfortunately, if he&#39;s<br/>\nsmart he won&#39;t tell me.  ;-/<br/>\n<br/>\n[51 Minstrel] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
