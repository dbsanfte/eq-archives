Chords<br/>\nof Dissonance was doing 7.  Denon&#39;s also decreased the target&#39;s AC by 9, which<br/>\nis very good.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen playing their respective instruments, Denon&#39;s was going 19 damage per tick,<br/>\nwhile Chords was doing something like 15.  Denon&#39;s was also decreasing AC by 19,<br/>\nwhich is a LOT.  This is MORE than taking off a steel breastplate and going<br/>\nbarechested.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that these songs are &quot;damage over time&quot; songs, so that once you<br/>\nmake them &quot;wince&quot; once, it will damage them 2 more times, so if I were to juggle<br/>\nthese two songs and Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow, here are the effects I would have:<br/>\n<br/>\nTick 1:  Denon&#39;s makes them wince for 9, and reduces their AC by 9<br/>\nTick 2:  Chords for 7, Denon for 9, AC still reduced<br/>\nTick 3:  Bellow for 13, Chords for 7, Denon for 9, AC still reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe net result of all this:  54 damage, AC reduced by 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompare this to most people&#39;s tactics, which is Bellowing all three rounds, for<br/>\na net damage of 39 and no AC reduction.  Over a long fight, this is a<br/>\nsignificant difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing that we tested... Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding, in addition to<br/>\nreducing attack speeds, lowered AC by 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
