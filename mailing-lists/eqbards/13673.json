Not for Gobs :-).  Also, if you<br/>\npull from Oasis, you need only to run to the inn.   The caster will come up<br/>\nfar enough so that it can see you to nuke.  When it does, have a tank engage<br/>\nit, snare and fear it.  Won&#39;t get another cast off the rest of the battle.<br/>\nAlso, the inn is a GREAT area for fear and snare since the MOBS will tend to<br/>\nwalk back and forth rather then run across the zone when feared here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre biggest problem was the newbies fighting DW Gob pets got pissed at us<br/>\nfor stealing their bread and butter.

I only counted 6<br/>\n&gt; goblins - four in each corner of the tower, two in the top.<br/>\n&gt; You can Lament them (which I did for the first few pulls), but<br/>\n&gt; it takes a lot of time to swim around getting the four<br/>\n&gt; corners, then swimming up so I could lull the two inside the<br/>\n&gt; tower.  By the time I finished this, pulled, fought, and<br/>\n&gt; rested from the fight, the tower was fully spawned again and I<br/>\n&gt; had to repeat the entire process.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So ideally you&#39;ll want someone to cast harmony to lull<br/>\n&gt; everything at once, then pull.  If you overpull (which is<br/>\n&gt; pretty easy), you&#39;ll want the enchanter to mez the<br/>\n&gt; extras.  This will save you enough time that the gobs won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; respawn by the time you&#39;re ready for the next pull.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The biggest problem are the casters.  Not only do they like to<br/>\n&gt; stand back and nuke, they like to stand back and shoot arrows<br/>\n&gt; at you, so they&#39;re even less likely to run within melee range<br/>\n&gt; of your group.  I think this is why most people pull to the<br/>\n&gt; zone - so they aren&#39;t nuked by a caster that&#39;s still at the<br/>\n&gt; water&#39;s edge out of sight.  You&#39;ll want a full-time healer if<br/>\n&gt; your group is in the 30s.  If the group is in the 40s you<br/>\n&gt; should be ok with just a paladin doing the healing, as you<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t take as much damage from the nukes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The helms seem to drop pretty often.  I&#39;d say about 1 in 5<br/>\n&gt; goblins has one.  We got 9 last night.  3 for bards, one for a<br/>\n&gt; paladin who thought it&#39;d be neat to have a black helm, and we<br/>\n&gt; let 5 rot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, this being an open zone, be aware that once you break<br/>\n&gt; the spawn, people who are soloing will come down to pull<br/>\n&gt; goblins.  Usually the spawn is fast enough that this isn&#39;t a<br/>\n&gt; problem.  But if someone is being a jerk about it, just sit<br/>\n&gt; back for a few minutes and let the tower respawn.  That&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; remind them who&#39;s in control of the situation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
