I&#39;m lucky enough that I had a backup of<br/>\nmy EQ files when my hard drive crashed the other day.  I never changed my<br/>\nbound keys, so I have left and right as &#39;A&#39; and &#39;D&#39; respectively.<br/>\nConveniently, this is also what user defined 5 and 6 are set to.  I have<br/>\nsense heading on one, and forage on the other.  Life&#39;s good for da bard ;)<br/>\n(I also have &quot;Corpse&quot; set to User 5 and 6 in bank 5 for when I&#39;m trying to<br/>\ndo a speed corpse retrieval)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis brings me to an interesting point.  It was never announced *why* they<br/>\nchanged the bind, my assumption was to stop people who were using the<br/>\nmethod I just described to keep their sense heading and other skills like<br/>\nit maxed.  However, I have to counter that with logic from two directions:<br/>\nFirst, it neither compromises game balance NOR exploits something where the<br/>\nplayer is not taking risk, yet making gains. (the primary argument against<br/>\nkiting)<br/>\nSecond, it actually makes sense to be &quot;sensing heading&quot; while moving.  The<br/>\nonly reason it&#39;s not bound to the forward key is that I realized that I<br/>\nmight not want to lock that key down with something else.  It also makes<br/>\nsense to be foraging while moving - since foraging is not just &quot;digging&quot;,<br/>\nit&#39;s also spotting those berries in the underbrush, or what have you.  Of<br/>\ncourse, I&#39;m still concerned about the mysterious rabbits that seem to leave<br/>\npieces of themselves all over the place....<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
