I have a 15th level bard as my secondary character and he&#39;s<br/>\nan awesome change from my ranger and I&#39;m trying to figure out how to play<br/>\nhim most effectivly. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting orcs in Crushbone by meleeing<br/>\nthem and bellowing at them, it seemed to be working better than bringing up<br/>\nAnthem for it&#39;s haste factor. I tried using the 15th level song to mez them<br/>\nbut it didn&#39;t seem to buy me anything in combat, it did help me escape a<br/>\ntraining one afternoon though. Is there another way I should be playing the<br/>\nencounters? Is there any place you&#39;d recomend that would be hungry for a<br/>\nbard to group at my level?<br/>\n<br/>\nReedwind<br/>\n15th level bard<br/>\nBertoxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
