In this case both are related to the number of <br/>\npeople playing at a specific time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Um, duh.

If there were only two classes to <br/>\nchoose from then your analogy would be appropriate.  Since there are <br/>\n13 other choices however, it is not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming all classes were equally played, you&#39;d expect each class to <br/>\nbe equally represented at 6.67%.  If Bards account for 4%, they&#39;re <br/>\nbelow average, but not significantly below average.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming PVP and PVE were equally played, you&#39;d expect each type of <br/>\nserver to be equally represented at 50%.

This is true <br/>\nboth statistically, analytically, and practically.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe comparison we&#39;re making here of 4% Bard to 7% PVP is flawed.  <br/>\nWhat we should be comparing is the ratio of one choice to another 4% <br/>\nBard, 10% Druid, 8% Wizard, etc. to the ratio of one server choice to <br/>\nanother 7% PVP, 93% PVP.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard:Wizard 1:2<br/>\nPVP:PVE 1:13<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Not likely.  The reason more people don&#39;t play them is because the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>return on the work invested is not proportionate.  Unless you truly <br/>\nenjoy the actual work involved, there is no reason to play a bard.  <br/>\nSome people do enjoy the constant challenge despite the fact it is <br/>\nnot rewarded equivalently to the lesser challenges of other classes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Bards are not some Nietzschian ideal class that only those who are <br/>\n </span></blockquote>willing to sacrifice can play and for which they are rewarded with <br/>\nawesome powers.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is inherently arrogant to assume that bards are actually really <br/>\n </span></blockquote>powerful but are not played by more people solely because of <br/>\nignorance, laziness, or incapacity.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s back up a bit on this one.  Do you agree or not agree that <br/>\nBards are tougher to play to their fullest potential than a Druid or <br/>\na Warrior?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t some self-serving, stroke my own ego question.  Plain and <br/>\nsimple, &quot;Are Bards harder to play well?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI say: Yes.<br/>\nI think you say: Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we can move on to power, once we assume well played.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think a well played Bard is more powerful than a well played <br/>\nother class?<br/>\n<br/>\nI say: Yes.<br/>\nI assume you disagree: No.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only answer I have for why more people don&#39;t play Bards is cause <br/>\nthey&#39;re the hardest class to play well.  I&#39;ve seen, first hand, how <br/>\npowerful we can be in comparison to other group members.  I&#39;ve also <br/>\nseen, in perfectly balanced groups, how worthless what I have <br/>\ncontributes.  The only thing I don&#39;t see, first hand, is how the <br/>\ngroup operates substituting me for a different class.  Maybe the <br/>\nlevel of difficulty to play is not worth the extra power.  I suppose <br/>\nyou could argue that it&#39;s not, based soley on how few people play <br/>\nBards.  Or maybe people don&#39;t understand how powerful a well played <br/>\nBard can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
