I didn&#39;t get<br/>\nany noticeable improvement.  I replaced my 300a Celeron (overclocked to<br/>\n450) with a P3 700 three weeks ago (fastest chip the mobo will take).<br/>\nThere was a huge improvement in frame rate.

If I turn the<br/>\nclipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a decent trade off<br/>\nin viewable distance and twisting time.  Right now I feel the TNT card is<br/>\nholding me back the rest of the way.  But with Luclin coming out later in<br/>\nthe year I want to wait and upgrade the video card then.  To what I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow yet, depends on the prices and Verant&#39;s recommendations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
