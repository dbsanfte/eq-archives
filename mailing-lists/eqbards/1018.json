Who cares<br/>\nif we never get a chance to be very good at it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI intend to continue playing this class and really am having a good time, I<br/>\njust think in light of the circumstances there are a lot of skill that I was<br/>\nexcited about in the beginning that I pretty much don&#39;t even consider<br/>\nanymore because they seem useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nDual wield at 17 is really cool, and Bellows in place of kick is fine, but<br/>\nwhy no dual attack?  Apparently the bardic class was VERY powerful in beta<br/>\nand had to be toned down but I am thinking maybe it was toned down in the<br/>\nareas that made it too powerful and forgotten about in the areas it is very<br/>\nweak in.  Am I totally off base?

Any other magic class usually has a <br/>\n&gt; variety of usefull<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;spells, and I rarely see 1 (Lets say wizrd) using the same <br/>\n&gt; 4 or 5 spell<br/>\n&gt; over<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;and over again. They switch them around considering what <br/>\n&gt; the situation<br/>\n&gt; calls<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Gotta disagree here.  As an enchanter, I generally had a <br/>\n&gt; standard &quot;spell<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kit&quot; that I seldom changed.  As a Bard my song kit is much <br/>\n&gt; the same, but as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I get more protective songs they will take some precedence.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Note one VERY important thing:  We are NOT defined by our <br/>\n&gt; songs the way<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spellcasters are defined by their spells.  We are also middlin-fair<br/>\n&gt; &gt;warriors (You watch a wiz try to go toe to toe with a fast <br/>\n&gt; melee mob and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;see who&#39;s still standing).  We are also the SINGLE MOST <br/>\n&gt; VERSATILE CLASS IN<br/>\n&gt; &gt;THE GAME.  Read that sentence again.  There is NOTHING we <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t do:  pick<br/>\n&gt; &gt;locks, disarm traps, put monsters to sleep, heal our party, <br/>\n&gt; hide our party,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;take our party underwater....  Bards in EQ are the <br/>\n&gt; single-most powerful<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bard class I&#39;ve ever played (and this is from someone who&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; played Bard in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nearly every conceivable RPG).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;As has been stated before, we enhance a party.  If you want <br/>\n&gt; to convert a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bard to a mathematical formula, where fighters = 1, and <br/>\n&gt; spellchuckers = 1,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and Clerics = 1, Bards = x2 multiplier.  We make everyone better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Check out the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Are you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Friends tell friends about ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
