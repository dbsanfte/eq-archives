Please follow all traditional safety precautions.<br/>\n<br/>\nDetails follow:<br/>\nSecurity experts warned Friday of a fast-spreading new worm that could <br/>\ndelete files and fill up the hard drives of infected computers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worm, &quot;W32.Sircam&quot; or &quot;SirCam,&quot; arrives attached to an e-mail message <br/>\nwith a randomly chosen subject line, according to a report prepared by the <br/>\nAntiVirus Research Center of software maker Symantec. <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sircam.worm@...)\">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sircam.worm@...)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nVirus Characteristics:<br/>\nThis mass-mailing virus attempts to send itself and local documents to all <br/>\nusers found in the Windows Address Book and email addresses found in <br/>\ntemporary Internet cached files (web browser cache).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be received in an email message containing the following information:<br/>\nSubject: [filename (random)]<br/>\nBody: Hi! How are you?<br/>\nI send you this file in order to have your advice<br/>\nor I hope you can help me with this file that I send<br/>\nor I hope you like the file that I sendo you<br/>\nor This is the file with the information that you ask for<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you later. Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n--- the same message may be received in Spanish ---<br/>\n<br/>\nHola como estas ?<br/>\nTe mando este archivo para que me des tu punto de vista<br/>\nor Espero me puedas ayudar con el archivo que te mando<br/>\nor Espero te guste este archivo que te mando<br/>\nor Este es el archivo con la informaci├¥lue me pediste<br/>\nNos vemos pronto, gracias.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- end message ---<br/>\nAttached will be a document with a double extension (the filename varies). <br/>\nThe first extension will be the file type which was prepended by the virus. <br/>\nWhen run, the document will be saved to the C:&#92;RECYCLED folder and then <br/>\nopened while the virus copies itself to C:&#92;RECYCLED&#92;SirC32.exe folder to <br/>\nconceal its presence and creates the following registry key value to load <br/>\nitself whenever .EXE files are executed:<br/>\nHKCR&#92;exefile&#92;shell&#92;open&#92;command<br/>\n&#92;Default=&quot;C:&#92;recycled&#92;SirC32.exe&quot; &quot;%1&quot; %*<br/>\nAs the RECYCLE BIN is often on the exclusion list, check your settings to <br/>\ninsure that this directory IS being scanned.<br/>\nIt also copies itself to the WINDOWS SYSTEM directory as SCam32.exe and <br/>\ncreates the following registry key value to load itself automatically:<br/>\nHKLM&#92;Software&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;<br/>\nRunServices&#92;Driver32=C:&#92;WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92;SCam32.exe<br/>\n<br/>\nA list of .GIF, .JPG, .JPEG, .MPEG, .MOV, .MPG, .PDF, .PNG, .PS, and .ZIP <br/>\nfiles in the MY DOCUMENTS folder is saved to the file SCD.DLL (the 2nd <br/>\ncharacter of the name appears to be random) in the SYSTEM directory. Email <br/>\naddresses are gathered from the Windows Address Book and temporary Internet <br/>\ncached pages and saved to the file SCD1.DLL (the 2nd and 3rd character of <br/>\nthe name appears to be random) in the SYSTEM directory.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worm prepends a copy of the files that are named in the SCD.DLL file <br/>\nand attaches this copy to the email messages that it sends via a built in <br/>\nSMTP server, using one of the following extensions: .BAT, .COM, .EXE, .LNK, <br/>\n.PIF. This results in attachment names having double-extensions.<br/>\nThe program creates a registry key to store variables for itself (such as a <br/>\nrun count, and SMTP information):<br/>\nHKLM&#92;Software&#92;Sircam<br/>\n<br/>\nTo remove the worm:<br/>\n1. Run LiveUpdate to make sure that you have the most recent virus <br/>\ndefinitions.<br/>\n2. Start Norton AntiVirus (NAV), and run a full system scan, making sure <br/>\nthat NAV is set to scan all files.<br/>\n3. Delete any files detected as W32.Sircam.Worm@mm.]<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Service,<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nCheck out the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
