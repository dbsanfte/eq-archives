I always have Screech memed for that purpose and to clear any<br/>\nmob beating on the evac&#39;er. My group hasn&#39;t always been pleased but my<br/>\nphilosophy has always been it&#39;s easier to get one corpse than everyone&#39;s<br/>\ncorpse. Much like our monk, who takes deaths rather than bring too many back<br/>\nto the group and kill everyone, it&#39;s tactics. Overall time lost getting<br/>\ncorpses costs everyone experience. And then sometimes it works: we were in a<br/>\nraid on The Hole, pulls for the whole raid went really bad, pullers yelled<br/>\nevac and died. We were getting hammered from all sides and I started<br/>\nScreech. The wiz asks if he should evac about the time my screen scrool at<br/>\nleast twice maybe 3 times with Fear wearing off messages. We evac&#39;ed and<br/>\nwere ready to help the rest with CR. Of course many times I&#39;ve started<br/>\nScreech only to have everything turn and pound me into the dirt in a blink.<br/>\nMaybe with higher defensive I&#39;ll live long enough to make more stuff madder.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
