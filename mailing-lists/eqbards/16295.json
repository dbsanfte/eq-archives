Group A says, &quot;We have a list to <br/>\nget in.  You&#39;re all on the list now.  Wait your turns please, just like <br/>\neveryone else.&quot;  It&#39;s my understanding that guides would NOT force any <br/>\nchange from this procedure because that is sharing - the guides would <br/>\nintercede if people had no way to gain access to a spawn because (e.g.) a <br/>\nguild was camping it to farm an item and everyone who left was replaced with <br/>\nanother guild member.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother point: speaking only for E&#39;ci, I was in Lower Guk the other night <br/>\nand there was a lot of discussion ooc about this.  The unanimous zone <br/>\nconsensus (no dissent was voiced in any case)?  If anyone ever tries to walk <br/>\nin and &quot;steal&quot; a spawn (i.e. Group B in above example) the members of Group <br/>\nB will quickly find they don&#39;t get invited into any more groups, as we as a <br/>\nserver don&#39;t want to deal with that kind of BS.  The folks in group A are <br/>\nrequested to shout to the zone the names of the jerks who are trying to <br/>\nmuscle in on their camp, and who don&#39;t have the maturity and respect to wait <br/>\njust like everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this policy has some potential to help, in those cases where people <br/>\nare truly unreasonable and don&#39;t want to give you any chance at a spawn <br/>\nuntil their guild / friends have all had a chance.  This DOES happen, and <br/>\nit&#39;s wrong.  The &quot;Play Nice&quot; policy will be effective as a means of <br/>\npreventing a group from saying, &quot;Sure, we only have 3 people, but we don&#39;t <br/>\nwant any more now cause our buddies will be online in 4 horus and we&#39;re <br/>\nturning this spot over to them so we can all get the Item of K3wlness&quot;.  I <br/>\nthink it will be applied very sparingly, and by and large will have little <br/>\nto no impact on most of us.<br/>\n<br/>\n/split 0 0 0 2<br/>\n<br/>\n(there&#39;s my 2 cents)<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
