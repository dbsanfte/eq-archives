Are you sure about that? Raptors have on<br/>\nthe average about 4k hp. A druid over 49 has one AoE, Lightning Blast,<br/>\nthat does 477 dmg for 225 mana. so assuming no resists, that would be<br/>\n1800 mana. The other AoE is much less efficient. Lightning Blast is<br/>\nmagic based so it tends to get a lot of partial resists. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible but it sure looks like you&#39;d be cutting<br/>\nit real close with mana. It&#39;s way more efficient now for a druid to use<br/>\nroot/dotting (rotting). I can solo pull a raptor, stack 3 dots on it,<br/>\nand med back to about 1 1/2 bubbles of mana by the time it dies if I&#39;m<br/>\nlucky on resists and root breaks. The L49 (and 56) roots last over 2<br/>\nminutes with a break check every 30 seconds so unless you run into a<br/>\nclump of bad rolls, it&#39;s pretty likely the first or second root will run<br/>\nthe whole 2 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen druids quad kiting when I&#39;ve been out there. I see a lot<br/>\nof wizards kiting about 6-8 around though. Now that&#39;s impressive. But<br/>\nI&#39;ve also seen how hard it is for Wizards to get groups so I guess it<br/>\nbalances out.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone worked out if the chant dot dmg keeps going up after 50? I&#39;ve<br/>\noften thought about getting a bard to come out and team up on<br/>\nroot/dotting with me, as all 3 dots and mana song would probably speed<br/>\nthings up considerably.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
