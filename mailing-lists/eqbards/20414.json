Great zone for a<br/>\nyoungun, a nice place to hang with higher levels too for advice,buying and<br/>\nselling and drive-by buffings.<br/>\n<br/>\n11-12.25 has been Kurns Tower as I reported. One nice thing about the<br/>\nskellies is that quite often they drop 2-4 gold, which is a lot for a level<br/>\n10-12 mob. When you get bored you can go outside and look for bugs/exiles.<br/>\nIt is starting to get a bit long in the tooth however, I think it may be<br/>\ntime soon to be off to Unrest. I just can&#39;t miss it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne note on the Kicsh, when I said i would wait till 19 to go get it I was<br/>\nassuming it was still NO DROP and I might be able to loot it if I was<br/>\npatient. Since it isn&#39;t....I think it will be a while longer :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz/Tsengu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
