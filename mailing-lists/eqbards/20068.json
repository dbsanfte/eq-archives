And IMO it wouldn&#39;t devalue the enchanter class.  Groups<br/>\nwould still prefer enchanters over bards for crowd control because they do<br/>\nit better.  But if an enchanter is not available, then a group with a bard<br/>\ncan still go, albeit with higher risk, to the high level dungeons where<br/>\nenchanters are considered mandatory.  The &quot;risk vs reward&quot; theme is part of<br/>\nthe official Vision (tm).  So groups willing to risk going to these places<br/>\nwith a bard to handle AE crowd control deserve the chance to get rewarded if<br/>\nthey are willing to risk it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Merck [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mmerck@...\">mmerck@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 27, 2000 8:01 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Another Lullaby question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the reason lullaby will never work to the degree we all want it too<br/>\nis simple - it would devalue the enchanter class to such a huge degree there<br/>\nwould hardly be a need for them. It would be so hugely unbalancing that VI<br/>\nwill never make it work the way it seems it should.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn AoE mez that doesn&#39;t require mana, doesn&#39;t require targeting, allows you<br/>\nto melee as well and crowd control with no effort, risk or thought other<br/>\nthan hitting a single hotkey is just too powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the same reason they nerfed 54 chains.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe what people should do is offer suggestions about how to balance the<br/>\nsong in a different way other than having it not work 90% of the time. Like,<br/>\nmake it cost mana for each pulse or make it effect the bard as well as the<br/>\nmobs, or make it a single pulse song instead of a constant one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; After looking over the Lullaby data again while posting a huge<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sledgehammer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of a question hit me over the head.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why does Lullaby have a secondary resist???<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
