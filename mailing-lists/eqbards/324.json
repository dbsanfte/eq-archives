Mellow<br/>\nout man!  Ask first, see whats going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a Soerbaird, but I&#39;ve been paying attention.  As I understand it<br/>\nthey are still relatively new, and are still compiling these song lists and<br/>\nhelp sections.  They are probably focusing more on in game help for now,<br/>\nuntil they can compile more in-depth song lists etc.  Why would they bother<br/>\nto re-hash the same information on bards you can get 100 other places on the<br/>\nweb?  They can&#39;t help you without experience, and they can&#39;t get experience<br/>\nuntil they level, and I can&#39;t see that they have enough high level people to<br/>\nproduce what you are DEMANDING.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegretfully,<br/>\nGabriel<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Rice &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnrice@...\">johnrice@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 10:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] the soerbaird - question and or sick of hearing about it<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;John Rice&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnrice@...\">johnrice@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been to the soerbaird site, and it&#39;s very nice looking.<br/>\n&gt;You can see lots of bard tales and songs made up by people<br/>\n&gt;playing as bards in eq.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;However: Please!

If y&#39;all want to go have your private little<br/>\n&gt;group and harvest a bunch of information which you then keep<br/>\n&gt;to yourself, then I for one don&#39;t want to hear the<br/>\n&gt;name of your clubby club on this list again. Any information<br/>\n&gt;that I am able to unearth about the bard profession is<br/>\n&gt;public knowledge as far as I&#39;m concerned and I would be happy<br/>\n&gt;to have it repeated to any struggling or curious bard out there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I missed a link or something, then I apologize in advance,<br/>\n&gt;and long live the soerbaird :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Berk Half-Elven<br/>\n&gt;Rallos Zek (a rough place<br/>\n&gt;to sing songs I might add)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Randy Varnell [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rvarnell@...\">rvarnell@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 5:14 PM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Re: Songs descriptions<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Randy Varnell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rvarnell@...\">rvarnell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hail Roop and bards!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This was an excellent list indeed.

How long do I have?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I would advocate that this song is more effective than it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; currently is, for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; at the moment it seems to be making no difference in my buying.
