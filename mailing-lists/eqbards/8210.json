On dmg 2 fists, the most you are gonna do<br/>\nis 3 or 4 dmg.  That&#39;s not enough dmg, when the wisps can hit<br/>\nfor up to 20.  Max H2H I&#39;ve seen at level 38 is 8 dmg, nothing<br/>\nhigher.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonks however at level 10-15, are punching for about 12-15<br/>\nper hit and dual punch.  With magic gloves a monk can defeat<br/>\na white con wisp, I&#39;ve done it myself with my monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 38th unchained melody.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
