He died *at the feet* of the<br/>\ncyclopses.  His buddies gave him a few gold pieces and a slap on the back and<br/>\ntold him he was SOL.  I initially heard him some time after that /shouting<br/>\n&quot;Can someone PLEASE help me retrieve my corpse?&quot;  Well I was only level 5 at<br/>\nthe time and had just gotten Selo&#39;s and a drum, so I /tell him and meet up<br/>\nwith him.  To make a long (four hour) story short, I ended up Selo&#39;ing up and<br/>\nspeeding through the cyclops camp.  They followed me around the zone for about<br/>\n30 minutes (I was the source of much /shouting)  because my new-found friend<br/>\ngot frightened and turned-around and lost his bearings.  So I towed the<br/>\nCyclops brothers around the zone while he looked for his corspse without my<br/>\nassistance.  He eventually found it and looted it.  By this time I had the<br/>\ncyclops brothers and two or three each of bears, lions and wolves on my tail.<br/>\nI took them to a nice secluded zone border and zoned out, waited for a couple<br/>\nof minutes and then zoned back in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a freakin&#39; HERO to this guy.  To this day he never fails to /tell me<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s online.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.

I usually want to help whenever I<br/>\n&gt; can and admit I have even foolishly helped someone get their corpse from the<br/>\n&gt; heart of the Ogre Camp.  I didn&#39;t die, but I probably should have.  I&#39;m sure<br/>\n&gt; many people were amazed who saw this lone bard racing across W Karana with 8<br/>\n&gt; or so ogres in tow.  I let them take a rest stop at guard tower number two<br/>\n&gt; while I raced on to the zone.  I imagine they made short work of the poor<br/>\n&gt; guards there, but hey that&#39;s why they get hazard pay!  Hopefully they paused<br/>\n&gt; at tower one or their way as well, &#39;cause after I zoned back in from Q Hills<br/>\n&gt; the remains of their angry band were meandering back towards the camp.  Its<br/>\n&gt; amazing how easy it is to loot a body in the middle of a now empty ogre<br/>\n&gt; camp, no one goes near the place to bother you!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Blair, Keith (Keith Blair) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 24, 1999 1:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Corpse Recoveries<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How would others have handled this situation?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Exactly as you did. There&#39;s no bank there to store<br/>\n&gt; your items in. There&#39;s absolutely NO reason for you<br/>\n&gt; to have put yourself in jeopardy like that. If it<br/>\n&gt; was a friend, I would have gone to Qeynos, banked my<br/>\n&gt; stuff and came back - but for someone you just know<br/>\n&gt; by seeing occasionally, and you were getting ready<br/>\n&gt; to log out? &quot;Best wishes..&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Two corpses are worse than one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do others have experiences where players feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like just because we can located we&#39;re somehow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *obligated* to do so regardless of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; circumstances or dangers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personally, I wouldn&#39;t even bother to ask someone to<br/>\n&gt; help me retrieve my corpse in a horribly dangerous<br/>\n&gt; situation like that. When I died in the Ogre camp<br/>\n&gt; I asked for help of higher level characters and told<br/>\n&gt; them what I needed help with so that they knew before<br/>\n&gt; even answering. Even when I found one willing to help,<br/>\n&gt; they backed out when he saw just how many Ogre&#39;s were<br/>\n&gt; there. I thanked him and let him go. No use making<br/>\n&gt; him die too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members: don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist<br/>\n&gt; Join our community member news update at<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter5\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter5</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\n&gt; programs, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter4\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter4</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
