I&#39;ve gotten left out of two groups in the last week<br/>\nbecause they &quot;needed&quot; an enchanter for crowd control.  They were both 4 tank<br/>\ngroups so clarity wasn&#39;t really an issue.  They said, and I believe them,<br/>\nthat if my crowd control songs weren&#39;t broken they would have rather had me<br/>\nin the group since I could help them out with downtime (they had no healers<br/>\nother than a ranger).<br/>\n<br/>\nI play a bard primarily for RP reasons, but I think the bard class is a good<br/>\none.  If they would fix our broken or useless songs we would be fine.  Most<br/>\nof the weakness I perceive in the bard class is not because of Verant&#39;s<br/>\nvision of a bard.  It is mostly because Verant has made melee classes so<br/>\nmuch less common than casting ones through some of their decisions.  EQ is<br/>\ndefinitely a caster&#39;s game powerwise.  Melee characters might get all the<br/>\nneat toys, but caster&#39;s get all the things that make playing easier.  If I<br/>\nplayed with less casual players maybe it wouldn&#39;t be as much of an issue.<br/>\nEvery time I get in a melee heavy group we have a great time and I can<br/>\ncontribut enormously.  In a caster heavy group all the weaknesses of the<br/>\nbard class come to the forefront, and if there&#39;s an enchanter present I feel<br/>\npretty useless.  Unfortunately caster heavy groups seem to outnumber tank<br/>\nheavy ones by about 5-1 at least.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
