I&#39;ll never forget the first time my players in Rolemaster decided to<br/>\njump the bandits that had gotten the drop on them with bows.  The players<br/>\nwere all used to D&D where the pitiful damage from an arrow would never<br/>\ndeter you from charging the guy pointing it at you.  Nearly the entire party<br/>\nwas massacred.  I think Rolemaster is one of the most realistic systems out<br/>\nthere, but playing it without the aid of a computer to do all the modifiers<br/>\nand chart lookups is too cumbersome.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Legba Work [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, November 17, 2000 7:15 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Dark Age of Camelot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the real reason their combat system differed from ICE&#39;s Rolemaster<br/>\nis you practically need a phd in mathermatics to decipher Rolemaster.
