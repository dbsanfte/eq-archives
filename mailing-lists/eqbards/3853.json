Don&#39;t even WANT bronze, too dang<br/>\nheavy for little ole woodelf me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah - the little things are what *I* enjoy - I only bash monsters when<br/>\nI have to. My motivations and enjoyment is almost the exact opposite of<br/>\nwhat Verant obviously thinks folks &#39;should&#39; be wanting to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:15 PM 7/16/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;FRD&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frd@...\">frd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Be carefull Sylly <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You were, and still Are, running around in full bronze plate at way to low<br/>\n&gt;a level, but since you are such a nice person, I dont mind. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That and Ive seen you many times and you havent gone from 9-30 in 3 weeks. <br/>\n&gt;you seem to get enjoyment from the little things and I like that....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jaez<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, July 15, 1999 3:28 PM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hehhe, in my original reply - I think something has been misunderstood<br/>\n&gt;&gt; along the way.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not against helping a new character a LITTLE - little patchwork,<br/>\n&gt;maybe<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a mino axe (easy and cheap enough to come by) few plat to ease the<br/>\n&gt;initial<br/>\n&gt;&gt; startup pain - and knowing an area is a HUGE plus on a second character.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I was outraged by lvl 1&#39;s in better stuff than I expect to have at lvl<br/>\n&gt;30,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; maybe even 40.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s just over the top.
