Have a hot key equipped with the /corpse<br/>\n&gt; command.  Go to your corpse - then walk a bit away - click that button - and<br/>\n&gt; drag your corpse to a safe location...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde Half-Elf of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Wanting to get back in touch with old friends?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Reunite through a ONElist community. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
