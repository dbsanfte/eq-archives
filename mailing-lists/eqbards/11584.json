Easy.  The only<br/>\nproblem nowadays is in simply finding two Hill Giants to rub together.  I<br/>\nusually have to stay up kinda late.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing.  I was wanting a stone the other night for my last piece of<br/>\nLambent.  The zone was camped and I couldn&#39;t find ONE giant, much less two.<br/>\nI /auc&#39;d for a stone and some jackass wanted 100pp.  I said &quot;Hey guy, I can<br/>\nbuy one from the INN in Rathe Mts., a 60 second run, for 48pp.&quot;  He called<br/>\nme a liar of course, so I ran to the Inn and bought it for 48pp.  That&#39;s the<br/>\nmost I&#39;ve ever paid for a stone, but I knew it was the last one I&#39;d ever<br/>\nneed.  I was impatient.  :-/<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations apart from soloing in<br/>\n&gt; the Rathe mts and charming giants to kill each other?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Faras<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
