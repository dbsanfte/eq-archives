Almost all the spell songs have a 4 to 6<br/>\n&gt;second duration.  It takes about 3 seconds to switch from one song to<br/>\n&gt;another (I&#39;m at level 11).  So you should be able to keep 2 songs<br/>\n&gt;continously up, or 3 songs where you manage to replace the 1st song<br/>\n&gt;right before it fades away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>actually 3 songs is fairly easy to do, four songs CAN be done, but you have<br/>\nlike 3 tenths of a second or something to do the switch. You have to almost<br/>\nanticipate the switch. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;3.  Magic gloves will not give you the ability to punch with magic. <br/>\n&gt;It seems only monks have that ability.  So stick to magic weapons, or<br/>\n&gt;your songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, and to boot our h2h skill maxes at like 60, so dont worry about<br/>\ntrying to keep on your h2h, its almost worthless later on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;4.  Maximize your weapon skills.  1H Slash is great for the beginning<br/>\n&gt;levels, but the best bard weapons are in Piercing.  I use 1H Blunt in<br/>\n&gt;trying out the theory that you can get better pelts if you don&#39;t hack<br/>\n&gt;the animal up -- haven&#39;t proven it yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Umm, i sincerly doubt that 1hblunt will yield better skins. I nearly fell<br/>\nout of my chair laughing when i read that.<br/>\nSure it makes sense in the real world... but your in verant&#39;s world now...<br/>\nAnyways, the best weapons are not necessarily piercing, but you are correct<br/>\nin that you want all your skills maxed, but this is not hard to do later on<br/>\nespecially if you are in a full group and the local mobs are dropping<br/>\nfinesteel. I picked up 2 fs rapiers and maxed my piercing in no time, and<br/>\nlater grabbed 2 fs warhammers and did the same with 1h blunt. At lvl 47 now<br/>\ni use dvinn&#39;s dagger in my ranged slot for the 2 dex and magic resistance,<br/>\nand the demon claw in the primary and the silvery war axe in the secondary.<br/>\nI sometimes use the staff of writhing when im bored and or want to show off<br/>\n:). I think a silvery scimitar would be better than the claw for the first<br/>\nhand but i have yet to get one. Also the crystaline sword might be a nice<br/>\nprimary, but i hate slow weapons. Course if the stupid ghoul lord would<br/>\never drop anything other than barbutes i might get myself a nice littel<br/>\nykesha. Or if i had the patience and a group willing to go to mistmoore i<br/>\ncould get a electrum plated wakizashi. Alright, starting to ramble. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;5.  Trust us bards:  Faster Weapons are Better.  Statistically, if<br/>\n&gt;you weigh the damage with a probability to hit, you would want more<br/>\n&gt;chances to hit.  Besides, heavy weapons are a drain on stamina, and<br/>\n&gt;with the bard&#39;s various combat speed songs, faster weapons definitely<br/>\n&gt;outdo the heavier weapons.  The best weapon for its current<br/>\n&gt;availability is the Dragoon Dirk from Ambassador Dvinn in Crushbone.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Slow weapons suck :)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;7.  Travel light.  There&#39;s a theory that getting anywhere near<br/>\n&gt;encumberance levels detracts from our fighting skills.  I&#39;m currently<br/>\n&gt;only wearing cloth armor; while I am currently having difficulty with<br/>\n&gt;blue monsters, I survive pretty well (Chant does wonders for AC, eh?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>um, im pretty sure that this ranks right up with the using 1h blunt to get<br/>\nbetter skills theory =)<br/>\nIf you go OVER your encumberance your agility will drop along with some ac<br/>\nand any chance of getting a dodge off. Ditch the cloth :)<br/>\nIm seriously starting to wonder if ac isnt more important that attribute<br/>\nboosts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You can kite by alternating Selo&#39;s and Bellow.  If you don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt;that, your next best option is Selo&#39;s and Hymn (run away, heal up<br/>\n&gt;fast, turn back and fight).  If you&#39;re in a safe area and know how to<br/>\n&gt;run around monsters, you can swap Selo&#39;s and Dissonance. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I killed 2 scythe beetles in nk that where red to me using this technique.<br/>\nI nearly died of boredom. But it works :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Anthem and Chant will not stack.  So Chant when solo, and Anthem<br/>\n&gt;(group +10% battle speed) when in a group.  Always use Whistle (+20%<br/>\n&gt;battle speed) if you&#39;re tanking.  Whistle and Anthem will give you<br/>\n&gt;25% battle speed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Later you get celerity which doest stack with chant. I use this in<br/>\npreference to berserker, and probably will be doing so till lvl 50 when we<br/>\nget verses. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;When running with Selo&#39;s in a group, try being the last one so that<br/>\n&gt;no one is left behind.  If you&#39;re stuck as pointman, switch to walk<br/>\n&gt;(I have agility 90, with selo and the hand drum, I seem to be walking<br/>\n&gt;just as fast as anyone else is running.  Heh!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agility does not affect movement speed. laggy connections DO seem to effect<br/>\nrunning speed though, i have seen some extreme examples of this before. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jig restores stamina.  Most known use is to allow you to swim above<br/>\n&gt;water for longer periods of time.  You can also use it to avoid<br/>\n&gt;hunger&thirst death -- you&#39;ll still be hungry, but you are &quot;tough&quot;<br/>\n&gt;enough to take it ... until you get to your corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jig is GREAT in kedge keep (course kedge keep sucks since its not itemized<br/>\nyet). 1 maybe 2 pulses and everybodies stamina is at full. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCourse you might be right about 1h blunt and skins and the encumberance<br/>\nthing, but i dont think so :)<br/>\nI do think bards need a better web site, there are some nice ones out<br/>\nthere, but they could use some more info.<br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, worst dressed bard on Tunare, lvl 47<br/>\nWho also happens to be too busy playing eq to make his own web site :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
