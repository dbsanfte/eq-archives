I was there too this weekend on<br/>\nE&#39;ci, helping a lower level ranger in our guild get some cash.  I just stood<br/>\nand played Melodic Binding and Lullaby while she solo&#39;d the raiders.  An<br/>\ninteresting note for lullaby, while victims apprently break out immediately<br/>\nall too often, it works really well with players who have weapons with high<br/>\ndelay.  The ranger was using her 2hdd sword and I&#39;d nod the raider who would<br/>\nmiss at least one attack while the ranger was between attacks.  Also, misses<br/>\nwould not wake the raider up, so sometimes she could swing freely 2-3 times<br/>\nwhile the raider just stood there waiting to be hit.  Very effective even<br/>\nwith only one mob when the delay time of the party is very high.  Also works<br/>\nto keep them from running briefly.  They nod and stop running until you hit<br/>\nthem again.  If they would fix the annoying instant breakout problem this<br/>\nspell would be awesome, as it is its still good, just unreliable which can<br/>\nbe too dangerous to use in some situations where it would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Operaman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slider@...\">slider@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 22, 1999 7:27 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Thanks, Kitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Operaman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slider@...\">slider@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi, thanks for the suggestion below! I took on the raiders yesterday and<br/>\ngot about 60pp for three hours work. That included dying twice to casters<br/>\ndue to lag (it was horrible Sunday!) and once due to a big newbie error.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig lesson: Don&#39;t sit to memorize Carrillon in the druid ring! The druids<br/>\ncon amiably, but that doesn&#39;t help when a grizzly wanders by. One paw swipe<br/>\nis all it takes to make you an affront to everything the druids (and two<br/>\ntreants) stand for. I made it about 50 feet from the ring...<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman Overtone<br/>\nMeandering Maestro of the 20th Song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom Kitasi&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a suggestion if you want to earn mega-cash very quickly.  The<br/>\nraider camp in the se corner of N Karana is fantastic for a bard of your<br/>\nlevel.  At 19 I can solo the camp and cannot keep it cleared, using lament<br/>\nto pull the bandits out one or two at a time.  The bandit wizards and druids<br/>\ncan be a tough fight, but the humans and barbs are easy.  You can get bronze<br/>\nweapons off the humans as well as red bandit sashes.  The red bandit sashes<br/>\nare a great money maker.  You turn them in to Chesgard in S Qeynos for the<br/>\nbounty.  With Carillion the bounty is 5-15gp, and a bronze weapon or round<br/>\nshield worth another 15-33gp.  All in all 2-5p per sash plus a smidgen of<br/>\nxp.  Add in a bronze rapier and you can get as much as 9pp off one green<br/>\nhuman bandit.  I made 50pp there two nights ago in about an hour.  I usually<br/>\naverage closer to 30pp an hour there, but I had some fortuitous spawns with<br/>\nmore bronze than usual.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
