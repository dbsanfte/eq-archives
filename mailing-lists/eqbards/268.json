Consider a guild, perhaps of bards or perhaps allowing<br/>\n&gt;other classes, whose primary purpose is to help one another and others.<br/>\n&gt;That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t run a business at a reasonable profit, but<br/>\n&gt;members of the guild should be known for acts of generosity and kindness<br/>\n&gt;rather than arrogance and self serving.  No reflection on other guilds<br/>\n&gt;intended.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The idea would be that anyone seeing the name of that guild would know the<br/>\n&gt;bearer could be trusted implicitly and appealed to for possible help.  I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;like to see it allow worthies of other classes and any race, but maintain a<br/>\n&gt;flavor of bardic oversight and origination.  It should have relatively<br/>\n&gt;independent chapters on all servers where people of good will wanted to<br/>\n&gt;join.  The only membership fee is a pledge, well-kept, to good will and<br/>\n&gt;honorable behavior.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We could name it, say, &quot;Song of &lt;something&gt;&quot;  like Harmony, Service, Aid,<br/>\n&gt;or such.
