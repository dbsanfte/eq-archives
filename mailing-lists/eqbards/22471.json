I could, however, still hear howling wind and birds chirping<br/>\nand my own avatar&#39;s footsteps.  Another weird thing is I could only hear<br/>\nspell sounds when someone cast the spell on me...It was an eerie night in<br/>\nHate, too quiet.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe someone has some advice, I would hate to have to figure out how to<br/>\nback out DX8 manually that seems like a bad task.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am using a SoundBlaster Ensoniq PCI64 soundcard which came with my crappy<br/>\nHP Pavilion 8280 when I bought it 2 years ago and I have never had any video<br/>\nor sound problems before in EQ or anything else for that matter.<br/>\n <br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
