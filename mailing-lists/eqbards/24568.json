Excalibur is a great guild, but just<br/>\nnever able to field enough folks of a similiar level to go do anything. It&#39;s<br/>\nnot that we were greedy or anything, just bored with the same zones, etc. So<br/>\nseveral of our friends from Excal had left and joined or dual guilded some<br/>\ntime ago to VS. We found ourselves being more and more involved with Venator<br/>\nSapentia raids and they becoming the folks we looked for when we logged on<br/>\nto see what we were going to do. It&#39;s difficult to not have the guildchat<br/>\nwhen you raid with a guild alot so I retired as an officer of Excalibur and<br/>\nhave guilded my bard to VS. Klaget had already joined a couple weeks before<br/>\nI did. My wiz and cleric are currently still guilded to Excalibur. It&#39;s a<br/>\ntough call really, because we like the folks in both guilds alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox - We were actually after the Procurator for a key to South and<br/>\nhopefully a bard mask. We went in last night and got both! I didn&#39;t know a<br/>\nkylong bp dropped, never seen one, although it makes sense with bracers,<br/>\narms, and legs dropping. I have the Trak bp so it&#39;s doubtful I would be<br/>\ninterested in a kylong bp. I am wearing a kylong bracer and the kylong legs<br/>\nwhich everyone tells me look hideous since I got the SS bp. It looks<br/>\nslightly better as an Erudite: green top and arms, pinkish red skirt, and no<br/>\nbucket helm!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
