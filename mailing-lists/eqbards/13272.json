I think bards are smack dab in the middle of the class<br/>\nspectrum. Whether that makes them &quot;hybrid&quot; or not I&#39;m not going to argue.<br/>\nFact is, bards don&#39;t get bind.  Whether they &quot;should&quot; or not is irrelevant<br/>\nin my opinion.  We get selo&#39;s, we get locate corpse and invis.  All three<br/>\nthings make any corpse retrieval easier than any other class that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nget bind.  Today I died in Oasis, and ran from the Arena (ack! Forgot to<br/>\nbind in Freeport), through the feeerrrroooottttt (spectre was in residence).<br/>\nThis is a trip I have seen many a higher level than me (17) warrior die on.<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not complaining.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI really like this game and despite the amount of grumbling<br/>\nI hear about class balance, I think Verant has done a pretty damn good job.<br/>\nSure there is room for improvement, there always is.  But frankly, if you<br/>\nwant bind and gate, play a class that GETS bind and gate :-).  It&#39;s like a<br/>\nShaman complaining we &quot;only&quot; get Alacrity, not the high end Enchanter swift<br/>\nlike the wind.  I personally like the fact that NO class (no, not even<br/>\nnecros) are a master of everything.  Makes interaction more necessary and<br/>\nmore fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI love this game :-)<br/>\n\t\tAnd I love you all...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHalana 45th Shaman<br/>\n\t\tTani 17th Bard<br/>\n\t\tSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
