Don&#39;t have<br/>\none myself but looking forward to it.  I have only been in Mistmoore 3-4<br/>\ntimes but on two of those occasions someone was auctioning the battle drum<br/>\nfor 500PP.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, one time someone pulled a train of the gypsies to the zone.  There were<br/>\ntwo regular gypsies and the named gypsy.  I had just zoned in.  There were<br/>\nabout 10 other players at the zone trying to fight them.  People started<br/>\ndropping like flies and one of the gypsies started attacking me.  I quickly<br/>\ngot pummeled hard so I zoned.  Soon, everyone who were fighting them and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t die zoned.  They were pretty beat up when they arrived in Lesser<br/>\nFaydark.  That leads me to believe you need a group of 30+ players to<br/>\nsurvive against the gypsies.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;      Mistmoore Battledrum:  Percussion Instrument.  +20% effect.
