This mean that most people using<br/>\nAthlons, Durons, and Thunderbirds will probably experience problems with the<br/>\nGTS.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds about right - Athlons and Via are not good bedfellows.  I&#39;ve got a<br/>\nGeForce DDR on a P3V4X mobo (Via Apollo Pro) with a P3-800 and it runs<br/>\nwithout problems.  There&#39;s not much to choose from a GeForce DDR and a<br/>\nGeForce2 GTS at lower resolutions (anthing less than 1024x768).  I also<br/>\ntried a GTS on the same motherboard for a week and it ran without problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your friend is on a budget, he might want to consider a GeForce DDR (such<br/>\nas the Creative Labs Annihilator Pro) which you can pick up for half the<br/>\nprice of a GeForce2.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
