So I wanted try<br/>\nthis idea out on everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn my second account would it make sense to create two first level rogues?<br/>\nOne Barb to sneak and park in EF/Perm and one DE to sneak and park in<br/>\nLava/Sol B?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m playing Tzeetch, I&#39;m thinking I could check for late night raids<br/>\non the second account. (My usual playing time is 10pm ~ 2am PDT.) Sounds<br/>\nsimple, but since I haven&#39;t heard of anyone discuss I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m<br/>\nmissing something.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, any fellow Xegony Bards know of any Friday raids going on for these<br/>\ntwo? I have the day off from family and work this Friday :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nTzeetch Spellsinger, Minstrel of 52 songs<br/>\nThe Commune, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
