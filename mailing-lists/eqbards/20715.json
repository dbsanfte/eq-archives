The spirits may require a gift for his<br/>\n&gt; magic to work -- it might be a bone chip, it might be<br/>\n&gt; a bottle of kalish and it might be free...but the<br/>\n&gt; price is the price and the spirits can&#39;t be denied;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I love this and plan to steal the idea for my own shaman!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy rogue denies being a rogue.  This will be easier as I get more changes of<br/>\narmor/weapons, but for now she usually claims to be a ranger who hasn&#39;t had<br/>\nfunding enough to purchase spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy bard is an entertainer and world observer.  It&#39;s not uncommon to see her<br/>\nchatting about forests with dark elves or jumping up and and landing in a<br/>\nsplit while playing her lute with her teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All my characters have a thing about beggars.  I think<br/>\n&gt; begging takes away from the game.  Terrok and Fenryr<br/>\n&gt; never give anything away, Tyunes likes to surprise<br/>\n&gt; young bards with hand-me-down items.  Ask and you<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t get. Offer to buy or just be polite and Tyunes<br/>\n&gt; will normally help out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Same here.  I given beggars foraged grubs and offered to teach them how to<br/>\nfish though.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia (& 7 other chars) Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
