Response is invariably, &quot;You think we need a real<br/>\ntank so bad, you start a warrior.&quot;  If these weren&#39;t friends and cowrokers<br/>\nin RL I&#39;d have quit EQ a long time ago.  No one is willing to put up with<br/>\nthe run back after death and I don&#39;t blame them.  It is ridiculous in the<br/>\nextreme.  If everyone had to make the run, some people would play melee<br/>\ntypes.  Since there is a way to avoid the run, play a caster, that is what<br/>\nnearly everyone does.  Our guild has 3 bards, 1 monk, 1 SK, and I think 1<br/>\npaladin and 2 rangers.  Everyone else is a caster.  75% casters.  Started<br/>\nout about 30% casters but everyone playing a melee class quit after about<br/>\n12th level or so and restarted as casters solely due to the binding issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 1:44 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Attack speedups <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nouch, no wonder you are getting wacked.  Your group needs to realize now,<br/>\ninstead of latter, that a real tank is a must.  Rangers are good secondary<br/>\ntanks, but are very bad at primary tanking.  Fortunatly is seems your core<br/>\ngroup is still low enough level where you can power up a real tank<br/>\n(preferably a Warrior) up to your level range if you all work together on<br/>\nthis.  Once your cleric hits 29 the run back is a moot point as you will<br/>\njust get a revive.  But please do yourself and your group of friends a favor<br/>\nand convince one of them to start a warrior, otherwise all of you will be<br/>\nfeeling the pain in a serious way in another 5-6 levels.   Trust me on this<br/>\nmy orginal guild kind of fell apart due to the lack of any real tanks (lots<br/>\nof rangers though).  And the eventually the level split in the guild lead to<br/>\nover recruiting, which always leads to a guild in crisis.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.

Generally the pullers bring back 1-3 <br/>\n&gt; mobs which<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t too bad.  Occasionally mobs will spawn in the spots <br/>\n&gt; they bring the<br/>\n&gt; pull back thru which leads to the bad pulls.  I have tried <br/>\n&gt; pulling but with<br/>\n&gt; no speed running and the pulling distances what they are in <br/>\n&gt; Sol A generally<br/>\n&gt; I am usually down to a bubble or two when I get back to the <br/>\n&gt; group.  I can<br/>\n&gt; generally do a better job of splitting the mobs though ;-).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am the tank unfortunately.  Its just me, and another bard generally.<br/>\n&gt; Occasionally we have a ranger but that&#39;s it.  Our guild is <br/>\n&gt; all made up of<br/>\n&gt; fairly casual players and no one else is willing to put up <br/>\n&gt; with 20+ minute<br/>\n&gt; runs every time they die so they all quit their melee <br/>\n&gt; characters some time<br/>\n&gt; ago and play casters now.  Our entire guild has about 30 <br/>\n&gt; members I think.<br/>\n&gt; Less than a third are non-casters.  In truth I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; generally see anywhere<br/>\n&gt; near as many non-casters in general.  The melee types I do <br/>\n&gt; see are nearly<br/>\n&gt; always either twinks or quickly level out of my range because <br/>\n&gt; they play far<br/>\n&gt; more time than I do.  Even our ranger remarked that he gave <br/>\n&gt; up hitting the<br/>\n&gt; taunt button if I was singing hymn.  It just didn&#39;t matter he <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t taunt<br/>\n&gt; anything off me after about 1 minute of fighting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Believe me, for Rp-ing reasons I want to pay my bard more <br/>\n&gt; than any other<br/>\n&gt; character.  This is the only list I even bother to read <br/>\n&gt; anymore because it<br/>\n&gt; is so far beyond the other&#39;s in terms of good tips, great debates, and<br/>\n&gt; generally fun people that I quit all the others.  I just <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t get to have<br/>\n&gt; much fun playing my bard anymore.  I had one really great <br/>\n&gt; nite in Sol A.<br/>\n&gt; The next three times I went it was pretty bad.  The last <br/>\n&gt; time, I got 1/2 a<br/>\n&gt; bubble of experience in 3 hours.  I spent the entire time <br/>\n&gt; running, dying,<br/>\n&gt; running back to zone, fleeing some other groups train, <br/>\n&gt; running from a bad<br/>\n&gt; pull, etc.  I would have actually had minus xp for the <br/>\n&gt; evening had I not<br/>\n&gt; been resurrected by a passing 50th cleric on his way into Sol B.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately he got there at the same time I did, so xp was <br/>\n&gt; the only thing<br/>\n&gt; I saved.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When you get to play only 2 hours or less most times you sit <br/>\n&gt; down, that 20<br/>\n&gt; minute penalty for dying becomes quite huge.  The night I <br/>\n&gt; died 3 times I got<br/>\n&gt; to actually play for less than 30 minute.  the rest of my <br/>\n&gt; time was spent<br/>\n&gt; running back to my corpse.  Only one of those deaths was <br/>\n&gt; avoidable, the rest<br/>\n&gt; were the result of being trained by another group or lone wolf.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 11:14 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Attack speedups <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kit, <br/>\n&gt; If I ever met a cleric with an attidude like that (ie let <br/>\n&gt; some one die to<br/>\n&gt; prove a point) I would quickly add him/her to my no group <br/>\n&gt; list.  It sound to<br/>\n&gt; me you need to teach the pullers in your groups that pulling does not<br/>\n&gt; meaning bringing a train of 4-6 mobs back to the group.  If <br/>\n&gt; they can&#39;t do it<br/>\n&gt; I suggest you take over the pulling duties and show them how <br/>\n&gt; it is done.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rokenn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS Also you may want to teach the &#39;tanks&#39; to hit the tuant button :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
