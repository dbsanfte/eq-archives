Bind Affinity is for<br/>\n&gt;pure spellcasters, not hybrids or jack-of-all-trades.  While Bards can<br/>\n&gt;travel a lot, we are the class that least needs Bind Affinity.  With Selo,<br/>\n&gt;we can travel much faster than any other class (besides the high level gate<br/>\n&gt;spells).  And I don&#39;t understand where you think we are &quot;supposed to be the<br/>\n&gt;most traveling class in Norrath&quot;.  My Cleric has traveled much more than my<br/>\n&gt;Bard, and this was before the Cleric had Bind Affinity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Selo&#39;s does disrupt SoW.  This is most likely a bug.  Selos also disrupts<br/>\n&gt;Root.  This is most likely the same bug.  Fixing one bug will fix the other<br/>\n&gt;bug.  I think most Bards would prefer to have this &quot;bug&quot; in the game.<br/>\n&gt;Verant seems to be willing to leave it in for &quot;gameplay&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wayne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    Date: Fri, 18 Jun 1999 17:58:18 -0500<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    From: &quot;Bard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: (no subject)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; First off, yeah my character&#39;s name is Barrd (Supposed to be &quot;Bard&quot;, but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that damned name filter...), which is a character I&#39;ve RP&#39;d since the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>good<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; old days of NWN.
