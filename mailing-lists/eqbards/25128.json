It comes off a named gnoll<br/>\nin the pit in Velkators. If that guild does dragons, is dragon capable, you<br/>\nmay mention a Selo&#39;s drum. They are tradeable, and if the rest of the guild<br/>\nbards have one, they are just spare loot. They drop off a couple dragons so<br/>\nnot all that rare a dragon drop. Of course they should have the option of<br/>\noffering you some other nice item as well. I&#39;m a rotten trader though so my<br/>\nopinion isn&#39;t worth much. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEpic: Gore: well I bound my wiz at perma and made it a daily habit to check<br/>\nfor her and Gore every day. Also had my guild and our friends in other<br/>\nguilds watching out for her. One day about a week ago she spawned right<br/>\nafter I had made my rounds. A guildmate was in DL when she spawned, so I<br/>\njust started /w all looking for all those people and guilds I have helped do<br/>\nepic stuff. Calek brought a bunch of SoA&#39;s and Sebastiian brought some DK&#39;s<br/>\nand we fielded a group or 2 from VS, plus ones and 2&#39;s from other guilds. I<br/>\nhad a large turnout ready to go in about an hour and we rocked! We will<br/>\nprobably be killing Gore and Vox more as we have Paladins needing the frost<br/>\nbook still. <br/>\nMy red scale came from Ragefire. My fianc├® is a cleric (Klaget) and we<br/>\nfinally got the Ragefire camp about a month ago. We camped for like 4 days<br/>\nstraight and dropped a red scale for me along with Klaget&#39;s last piece for<br/>\nhis epic. Trak was the same way. We actually tried to do Trak last Saturday<br/>\nbut it went wrong. Someone cast something right when the bard died and Trak<br/>\nspawned and he immediately killed all the casters. We melee didn&#39;t know it<br/>\nat the time and managed to melee him down to Tra! He despawned while we were<br/>\ndoing CR. So I went back to bard watching. We planned to try him Monday<br/>\nnight first thing since he was up Sunday night late. Monday he wasn&#39;t up til<br/>\nabout 8 pm though but we had lots of folks on standby and pulled it together<br/>\nfast. We applied what we learned from last time and wiped Trak out.  There<br/>\nwas a tense moment when people were dropping from poison, the clerics were<br/>\noom and I was poisoned and trying to loot the guts before I died! Someone<br/>\nfinally got me cured about the time the corpse opened up. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2 things I think helped me the most in all this: helping lots of folks<br/>\nso they were there to help me. Post on message boards so folks can know<br/>\nahead of time what&#39;s up. It takes lots of folks to do these mobs and that<br/>\ncan be a logistical nightmare. We have a public message board you can get to<br/>\nfrom our website: www.venatorsapentia.com &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.venatorsapentia.com\">http://www.venatorsapentia.com</a>&gt; .<br/>\nWe had awesome support from Shards of Avalon, Death Knights, Marauders of<br/>\nthe Dragon, Order of the Ebon Muffin, and of course my guild Venator<br/>\nSapentia, and a couple more folks in other assorted guilds. Our loot rules<br/>\nfor these things are the person calling for the raid for their epic piece<br/>\nhas unquestionable rights to that piece, other drops are lottoed. For<br/>\nmultiple folks, whoever is closest to completion has priority, with the<br/>\nunderstanding you come back and help the next guy get his.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
