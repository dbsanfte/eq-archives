I mean the armor quests from dorks,<br/>\nerr, dorfs.  You can get the &#39;equivilant&#39; of PoG dropped armor by doing<br/>\nquests for Dwarfs (or giants, perhaps dragons?) Supposedly there are<br/>\ndifferent ways of getting more or less equivalent items. Questing seems to<br/>\nbe much harder than hunting in PoG.  Since I posted, someone mentioned that<br/>\nthey worship Bristlebane so I guess it makes some sense to reward his<br/>\nfollowers for hunting in PoG - albeit at the expense of faction loss that<br/>\nmay haunt (or maybe only annoy) you in other parts of the &#39;world.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Moss [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Olmoss@...\">Olmoss@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 24, 2001 2:58 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Avoiding faction hits in PoG when pulling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJames Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I dont understand is: why is our loot dropping there?<br/>\n&gt; Yes, there are quests that offer very similar rewards but have you tried<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; get them?
