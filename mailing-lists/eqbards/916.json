Now that I am <br/>\n&gt;settled with moving and all and getting EQ ready, can anyone (especially <br/>\n&gt;those that have played on more than one server) give me any suggestions as <br/>\n&gt;to what the best servers are to play on?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am currently roaming several planes of Norrath, though Fennin Ro is my<br/>\nprimary home. I don&#39;t have significant problems with any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The group that I was always with in P4 is on Veeshan, and they are right <br/>\n&gt;about to hit 50th level (all of them!)...and, well - they are pure <br/>\n&gt;powergamers. I was wanting to join them, but there is no way I could keep up <br/>\n&gt;with them. Actually, I&#39;m thinking of taking it easy. I did all the <br/>\n&gt;powergaming I need during beta. I would like to seriously get into the RP <br/>\n&gt;aspect of the game (or help to foster it).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aye, this will continue to be a problem in a world that rewards combat<br/>\nheavily, especially if you are a hybrid profession.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I was on Fennin Ro at that time, and that server was a nightmare. I guess <br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s ok now? I heard that during beginning of commercial Fennin was even <br/>\n&gt;more crowded than before. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been on Fennin Ro since the release (and played there in P4). I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever had a problem with it. Most of the hype seemed to be that people just<br/>\nbottlenecked in the areas immediately around cities, rather than branching<br/>\nout a bit. Also, I don&#39;t spend a great deal of time in the dungeons<br/>\n(Blackburrow, Crushbone, etc) and I&#39;ve seen them VERY crowded on Fennin at<br/>\nprime time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Especially if there are any particular servers I should stay away from. I am <br/>\n&gt;thinking getting on the newest server would be ideal, though I don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt;which one is newest. Cazic?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Newest server is Erollisi Marr. Second newest is Rodcet Nife.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Randy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
