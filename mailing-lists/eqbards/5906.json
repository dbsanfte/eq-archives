If you zone with baddies whacking on you, you cannot die<br/>\nwhile zoning - you will come through with 1 hp.  It used to be<br/>\nthat you could die like this while zoning, which led to a lot<br/>\nof confusion (and sometimes corpses out of reach beyond the<br/>\nzone line), but they fixed it by making sure you come through<br/>\nwith at least 1 hp.  (This still happens though if you slide<br/>\nthrough a zone while unconcious - apparently the 1 hp check is<br/>\nbypassed if you are already below 1 hp.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  If you crash or lag at the right moment while zoning, the<br/>\nserver loses track of you and has to restore you from the<br/>\nlatest backup.  This seems to be more common if monsters are<br/>\nwhacking on you, but then I&#39;ve only seen it happen twice. Your<br/>\nhp and mana may be restored to full as some sort of safety<br/>\nmechanism, I haven&#39;t seen it enough to say for sure - neither <br/>\nof the persons I saw it happen to could recall if they were<br/>\nalready at full hp when they were last saved.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Sometimes you will zone, and will end up back in the zone<br/>\nyou just left (this is not bouncing off someone in the new<br/>\nzone - you only zone once, but end up where you started).<br/>\nYour hp are *not* restored in this case, and your new<br/>\nposition is right at the zone, so I think this is just a case <br/>\nof failed zoning due to problems on the server.  I had the<br/>\ndispleasure of dying to a train due to this one.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
