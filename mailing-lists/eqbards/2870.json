Interesting thing happened.  I was running through the commonlands,<br/>\nand a mage passed me going the opposite direction with a dervish in tow,<br/>\nslapping him the while.  I quickly halted and fired up Lullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dervish fell asleep.  The mage, quite weakened, continued walking<br/>\ntowards the zone border.  He actually got to the point where the dervish,<br/>\nwhom at that point I saw was very low on health also, was no longer right on<br/>\nhis tail.  But then came a paladin who had been running to catch up with<br/>\nthem apparently.  He swiped the dervish, dumb paladin, waking him up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point the dervish should attack me, or maybe the paladin.  Instead<br/>\nthe MOB continued after the mage, who was a good distance away by now!<br/>\nAfter it got in a few more swipes at this poor PC, the mage zoned.  It then<br/>\nproceeded to fight the paladin.  Well, irritated at this paladin for almost<br/>\ngetting the other fellow killed, I bellowed twice and stole his kill.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint of all this: If lullaby -does- nix the shit list, why did it go after<br/>\nthe mage?  Obviously the mage had done a great deal of damage to it, so it<br/>\nreally hated him.  But a nix is a nix, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
