Let&#39;s petition for trombones now! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther instruments Norrath is lacking:<br/>\n<br/>\nString: Vilia&#39;s Violin - Below a certain string skill level it will reverse<br/>\nany healing effects of songs played.<br/>\n<br/>\nPercussion:  Grand Piano - Weight 500, increases songs by 50%  Throw it<br/>\ninto a weight reducing pack and only whip it out for the Chants, not the<br/>\ntravelling songs.  Nothing like raiding The Hole as a pianist &lt;evil grin&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWind: Kelin&#39;s Kazoo - increases the knock-back effect of Pixie Strike but<br/>\nreverses the effect of Charismatic Carillon, also has a -5 CHA attribute<br/>\nand has a strong taunt effect.  Mobs WILL hit you in the face when you play<br/>\nthis.  So might party members.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrass:  Archangel Gabriel&#39;s Trumpet - Playing it will bring the server<br/>\ndown, but wouldn&#39;t it still be cool to have?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, 14.8 and crawling, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
