This is standard, plus I usually ask for tips or danger pay.    Does<br/>\n&gt;this sound like too little?  Maybe it should be 1 PP/2 levels after level<br/>\n&gt;10?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Personally I only ask for aid in returning to a safe city if it takes me<br/>\nwhere I do not feel I can&#39;t get safely back from. I tend not to charge for<br/>\nserves especially to inexperienced people. This is do to a personal creed of<br/>\nservice to aid my fellow travelers.<br/>\n    I also have served as mediator to merchants for those handicapped by<br/>\nrace prejudice. For it is hard when you can not even get a simple loaf of<br/>\nbread, and you are not in a friendly town. The chances of getting home<br/>\ndiminish for lack of a simple necessity.<br/>\n<br/>\n    But it is not wrong to charge as well, a bard must eat... No matter how<br/>\nit is done, as long as it is not though unfair practice that I will balk at.<br/>\nThen again, unfair is a reltive term, left for each to decide on...<br/>\n<br/>\n- SnowLynx, Gentlemen Bard of Freeport... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
