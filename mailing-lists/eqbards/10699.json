At 20th level on a non-mature server I had a combine rapier<br/>\nand a <br/>\ncombine dagger as my main weapons.  Barbed Whips were around, but were<br/>\ntrade <br/>\nonly and very rare.  FYI at 39th I just got a Runed Falchion this<br/>\nweekend :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain on armor at 20th I was wearing a mix of Banded, Bronze, and a few <br/>\nmagic pieces (spiked leather colar, etc). And I was well equiped (due to<br/>\n<br/>\nbeing a merchant bard).  I was able to get full steel by 29th.  Again on<br/>\na <br/>\nmature server it is not uncommon to see bronze sold for as little as 1<br/>\nplat <br/>\nper AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the risk of sounding like an old coot, you youngins today do not know<br/>\nhow <br/>\neasy you have it :)  In my day..... hah<br/>\nAnd the game is always changing, hopefully more mid level items will by <br/>\nadded.  I still crinch when I remember that the day AFTER I spent 220<br/>\nplat <br/>\non a Well balanced Rapier, the Ornate Dagger was changed into the<br/>\nDragoon <br/>\nDirk.  Then I found that the WB Rapier would only sell back for 45 plat,<br/>\n<br/>\naarrrrgggghhhhh.  I did manage to trade it for a runed bone fork though<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
