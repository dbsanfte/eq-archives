Running a guild has its expenses,<br/>\n&gt; especially if we are to<br/>\n&gt; provide collective services for our bards so that<br/>\n&gt; they might carry on their<br/>\n&gt; work with honor and dignity.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I mentioned to you before, lad, we provide the<br/>\n&gt; following services to our<br/>\n&gt; members:<br/>\n&gt;     * Patchwork armor for all new students<br/>\n&gt;     * The first five levels of songs for all new<br/>\n&gt; students<br/>\n&gt;     * A hand drum at level 5<br/>\n&gt;     * A lute at level 8<br/>\n&gt;     * Bi-weekly rewards for the best in-guild ballad<br/>\n&gt; or writing. This week<br/>\n&gt;        it was a Banded mail tunic.<br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n&gt; Also, we use the money to pay for other expenses,<br/>\n&gt; including:<br/>\n&gt;      * Staff for concerts<br/>\n&gt;      * Saving for a guild hall<br/>\n&gt;      * Prizes for other Soerbaird events<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We do not use guild money for:<br/>\n&gt;      * Buying better armor or equipment for guild<br/>\n&gt; leadership<br/>\n&gt;      * Bribing news sites for better placement<br/>\n&gt;      * Paying necromancers to destory anyone who<br/>\n&gt; speaks negatively<br/>\n&gt;        about The Soerbaird<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the public record, all of our staff, called<br/>\n&gt; Ollave, have more than paid<br/>\n&gt; their ten platinum, without a complaint, and most of<br/>\n&gt; them continue to<br/>\n&gt; contribute into the guild treasury on a daily basis,<br/>\n&gt; in order to benefit<br/>\n&gt; our students. I have seen several of them give the<br/>\n&gt; shirts off of their<br/>\n&gt; backs and the weapons from their fists to help a<br/>\n&gt; deserved student in need.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Doerbaird, before you sally our guild&#39;s reputation<br/>\n&gt; again in a public forum,<br/>\n&gt; I would respectfully request that you air your<br/>\n&gt; differences with me, as I<br/>\n&gt; will be happy to hear any problem you have with our<br/>\n&gt; guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Listen and Live.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- Jythri, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Joe Racke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joe_racke@...\">joe_racke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Is it just me or is Soerbairds guild a rip off....I<br/>\n&gt; really want to know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;why the heck it costs 10plat plus a monthly fee to<br/>\n&gt; join...thats a load<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of Bull crap.....I was going to join but then i<br/>\n&gt; found i had better<br/>\n&gt; &gt;things to do than pay to those greedy rogues....If<br/>\n&gt; you give me enough<br/>\n&gt; &gt;information on that guild and why it costs so much<br/>\n&gt; then i might join it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;until then.....keep begging Soerbairds.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is Ralborn Songbearer ending his song<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ralborn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bard of Qeynos<br/>\n&gt; &gt;follower of Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(also in his world)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community<br/>\n&gt; service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
