If there is a memory blur component it is _very_ weak.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My CHA is 104 (still waiting to get another Opalline Earring and/or the Veil<br/>\n&gt; that increases CHA - perhaps the leather foot raider cap), but I could never<br/>\n&gt; reliably pixie strike a faerie guard in lesser faydark.  Often times they<br/>\n&gt; would attack me immediately after it&#39;s &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; (even though I<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t in attack mode).  For that reason, I considered the song to be mostly<br/>\n&gt; useless - but then again that&#39;s the only time that I&#39;ve used it.  Also, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; found that MOBs can get off their spell faster than I can Pixie Strike them<br/>\n&gt; (even if I sing it immediately after they go into cast mode).  I used to<br/>\n&gt; consider the &quot;rhythm&quot; series to be useless as well, until I started using it<br/>\n&gt; against Shadowmen and resisted 6 or 7 Fears in a row.  I&#39;ll definitely keep<br/>\n&gt; playing with it, but I consider it to be overshadowed by charm, lullaby,<br/>\n&gt; screech, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is why, later in a bard&#39;s life, it becomes very frustrating when<br/>\nyou discover you can&#39;t charm a mob over 38. Pixie Strike is a very poor<br/>\nsubstitute for what I mainly used charm for. Casters seem to be able to<br/>\ncast fine while lullaby&#39;d so that&#39;s pretty useless as a replacement, and<br/>\nscreech can be suicide in some dungeons, especially lower guk where<br/>\nyou&#39;ll probably spend a lot of time. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, enjoy charm while you&#39;ve got it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
