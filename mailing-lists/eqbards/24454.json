As an<br/>\nindoor dungeon, Selo&#39;s is useless anyway, but it took me three attempts to<br/>\nget away from the Ice Giant Priest (or was it the Magi?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d run, he&#39;d summon and bash me a bit.  I&#39;d run again, get as far as the<br/>\nportcullis and *shwoop*, summoned again.  I don&#39;t know how I managed to get<br/>\naway that third time, but my heart was in my mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if Summoning requires mana or if it&#39;s an innate ability the<br/>\nmobs have.
