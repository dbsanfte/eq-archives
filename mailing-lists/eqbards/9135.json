Just as a marker, I have on <br/>\nseveral occasions made a High Keep/RV/Commons/NRo/Freeport run with six <br/>\nbackpacks full of armor (I&#39;m a smith, plus I have to get rid of all that HK <br/>\nbronze somehow, too), and even with an encumbrance of around 230 (str 96) I can <br/>\nstill run noticeably faster than normals (with Selo&#39;s and a drum).  When I was <br/>\nyounger and tailoring (before people realized that ruined pelts were worth <br/>\nsomething) I would visit all of the inns in Commons and fill eight backpacks <br/>\nwith them.  Even at encumbrances of near 300 I could still move (but only with <br/>\nSelo&#39;s active).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for amusement, convert all of your plat to copper sometime when you&#39;re at <br/>\nthe bank and check out your encumbrance.  24000/96, agility 1.  hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 30 songs (still), Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 26 Oct 1999, James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Heheh - dearest sister - I don&#39;t care if you twist chant, anthem, warsong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and selo&#39;s  - with 3210gp you would NOT be able to walk to the door much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; less run to somewhere in Rathe Mts - not even with a MM drum.
