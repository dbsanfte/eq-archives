Clouding only gives party see invis. In<br/>\nother words, the only invis you can see are the members of your party that<br/>\nyou have invissed. You do not see all invisible creatures and players, only<br/>\nthose in your party.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to see something that is invis outside of your party, see invis<br/>\nis still the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 50 Bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
