The way the rules work, the best strategy is for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everyone to concentrate on one opponent at a time, while the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; extras beat on you.  In real combat, that&#39;ll get you killed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; real quick since the extras will be getting free shots at your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; backside.  I&#39;d really like to see a CRPG with some sort of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; engagement/disengagement system.  Then the warrior wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to taunt, he&#39;d just step between the cleric and mob and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; engage the mob in combat.  If the mob turned to attack the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric, the warrior would get a free shot in for max or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; critical damage.  Yes this would require mobs to have better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AI, which IMHO is always a good thing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that for entertainment&#39;s sake, we wouldn&#39;t really want it. I see<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; point you are making, which is that it would require more strategy if they<br/>\n&gt; were to fight and take damage in a more realistic fashion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Potentially, if we wanted realism, 1 good stick in the gut should disable<br/>\n&gt; any mob or player then, which kind of ruins any suspense.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust so you know, the RPG I played most (and type of system I<br/>\nlike the most) was Traveller.  Yes, one good stick in the gut<br/>\ncould disable just about anyone.  Yes Muhammad Ali could be<br/>\nknocked out by one weakling swinging a pipe at his head from<br/>\nbehind.  Yes it changes combat tactics - rather than what you<br/>\ndo in a fight being important (which I always thought should<br/>\nbe based on the character&#39;s skill, not the player&#39;s ability to<br/>\nplay), how you plan a fight and how well you carry out that<br/>\nplan, and how you adapt to changing circumstances becomes<br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t picked it up yet from my other comments:<br/>\n<br/>\n- I don&#39;t like level based systems<br/>\n- I don&#39;t like class based systems<br/>\n- I don&#39;t like increasing hp systems<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, all of these are quick-and-easy approaches to &quot;solving&quot;<br/>\nthe playbalance problem by artificially imposing limitations<br/>\nto enforce orthogonality (balancing a game is much easier if<br/>\nthe factors you can tweak are all orthogonal).  The tradeoff<br/>\nof course is that you lose flexibility and diversity, and you<br/>\nget some really strange things happening in the game world<br/>\nphysics (e.g. high level people without safe fall surviving<br/>\nimpossible drops).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
