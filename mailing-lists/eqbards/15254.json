It&#39;s actually a little better<br/>\nas not only is it equivalent to hasting their attacks, but<br/>\nalso their healing rate, mana regen rate, casting delays,<br/>\netc. relative to the mob(s).  So in general, slowing down the<br/>\nmob is better than speeding up your group.  But speeding up<br/>\nyour group can never be resisted.<br/>\n<br/>\n- No, the slowdown doesn&#39;t affect mob casting speed.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Yes, you can use Chain and Warsong to get an equivalent to a<br/>\n56% haste (1.3*1.2) relative to the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Yes, you can use Chain and Anthem to get an equivalent to a<br/>\n43% haste (1.3*1.1) relative to the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Yes, you can use Chain and Celerity to get an equivalent to<br/>\na 50% haste (1.3*1.15) relative to the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the really disappointing (nonexistant) results from str<br/>\nbuffs, I would say speeding your group and slowing the mob<br/>\ntake top priority in increasing damage output.
