A song that teleports<br/>\nall party members in the zone to the bards location.<br/>\n<br/>\nName: Melanie&#39;s Call to Arms<br/>\n<br/>\nThis song would be extremely useful in conjuction with<br/>\na binding group leader.  Imagine doing an Efreeti Raid<br/>\nin SolB and wanting to bring in other members since<br/>\nsome need to leave.  Instead of breaking through again<br/>\nthe group leader would be bound at zoneline, group up<br/>\nthe bard and gate back to his bindpoint.  The group<br/>\nleader would then group up the 4 new members and the<br/>\nsong would be sung and would teleport everyone back to<br/>\nthe bard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few problems with this that may make it<br/>\ntoo powerful.  Such as Plane of Sky (never been<br/>\nmyself) where this song could not be used to bypass<br/>\nthe teleporters etc...  Also this song may need to<br/>\nremove the party members from all hate lists or risk<br/>\ncausing a hellish train through the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it does remove everyone from hate list the song<br/>\nbecomes MUCH more powerful (too powerful?) in that in<br/>\nPlane of Hate things go bad.  The bard runs up the<br/>\nwall away from the fight and sings the song, everyone<br/>\nteleports up the bard and is removed from hate list. <br/>\nTherefore removing the need for clerics to camp out<br/>\netc...  This song combined with Selo&#39;s would make the<br/>\nbard extremely wanted in any group, but especially<br/>\nraids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe song may need to use up mana, although I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t want all our songs using up mana.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know what you all think.  Its just an<br/>\nidea I came up with when I should be working =)<br/>\n<br/>\nJada MacAldred<br/>\nBard of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
