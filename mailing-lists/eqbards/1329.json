Why mournful you<br/>\nmay ask?  Because I have dedicated much of my time to a seemingly fruitless<br/>\npursuit of the arch-fiend Crookstinger, a demon in wasp form, for what other<br/>\nnatural creature would take a name unto itself and launch itself at others<br/>\nwilly-nilly!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI am dedicated to the pursuit of all things Crooky and make it a<br/>\npoint to always spend several days hunting the vile creature whenever I am<br/>\non Faydwyr, the land of my birth.  I would greatly appreciate any and all<br/>\ninformation the assembled group of loremasters might be able to provide me<br/>\non this clever foe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tUntil then, May Errolissi hold you in her arms always!<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Kitasi<br/>\n     The mournful bard of Faydwer on E&#39;ci<br/>\n      &quot;and no one shall work for money, <br/>\n       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>\n     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>\n        and each to his seperate star...&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
