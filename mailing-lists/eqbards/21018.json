It frees an extra<br/>\nsong in the rotation and is always on, rather than having to start it up<br/>\nwhile being pummelled.  Once you hit 46, you can kill even faster by<br/>\ntwisting the 3 dots with SoW.  One caveat, you require more kiting room<br/>\nusing SoW instead of Chains.  And if there&#39;s multiple mobs, I will always<br/>\ncharm 1, rather than kite them both.  I find this much more &quot;fun&quot; and I&#39;m<br/>\npretty sure it&#39;s faster, too.  In fact, if I&#39;m kiting, I might look for a<br/>\n2nd mob just to cut down on the tedium. :p<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one AC I helped kill, there was no question the ring went to my GF&#39;s<br/>\nMage. :)  Tho, I have to ask her to remove Jboots when we&#39;re traveling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
