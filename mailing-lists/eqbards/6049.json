My party consisted of a rogue, myself a ranger and<br/>\nthree wizzies.  That&#39;s right no healer whatsoever.   Let&#39;s see some of the<br/>\nlessons that I learned:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I cannot tank unless they are blue and totally asleep.<br/>\n2. Green ghouls hit harder and more often than me (Got ambushed by a 5<br/>\nghoul train)<br/>\n3. Yes healing song is great.  Gives you reason not to fight and get hit.<br/>\n4. The random number generator is horrible.  I am wearing almost a full<br/>\nsuit of plate and was encumbered, yet I was able to get this message 4<br/>\ntimes in a row &quot;A skeletal monk hits you, but you dodge&quot;<br/>\n5. Extra mobs love singers <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally <br/>\n<br/>\n6. Don&#39;t ever level when camping in a room or the Festering hag will come<br/>\nby to congratulate you =).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat happened to me last night as soon as I got my ding for my level I<br/>\nlook up and see my health bar drop from 5 bubbles to two bubbles in a<br/>\nmatter of seconds.  What appeared?  A festering hag coming to congratualte<br/>\nme on my level 25.  Was I singing a song? NOpe I was actually doing<br/>\nnothing at the time =).<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 3 Sep 1999, James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; here are a few tips passed along to me (usually when the party sees my hp<br/>\n&gt; slip under 2 bubs)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;you are about as much of a tank as t.a.f.k.a.Prince is a bouncer&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;you have to learn to stop hitting them and let them beat on the others&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;you have to learn to scrape them onto the real tanks&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;you have to learn to step out of the melee...it&#39;s called &#39;creative<br/>\n&gt; chickenology&#39;&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;GET OUT!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and then there is the famous....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;SYLLY WEP!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; which was preceeded by...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;you try to punch a aviak harrier but miss...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom:\tAbraham Hardjana<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSent:\tFriday, September 03, 1999 10:50 AM<br/>\n&gt; \t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Bard Superstitions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom: Abraham Hardjana<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tI would be the first to humbly agree that dying is greatest<br/>\n&gt; reason why I<br/>\n&gt; \t\tcannot level.

At least I got my level, though<br/>\n&gt; it took at<br/>\n&gt; \t\tleast another to earn it back =(.  Perhaps it is time to be<br/>\n&gt; less noble<br/>\n&gt; \t\tand more parts chicken.  It seems that I die more often when<br/>\n&gt; trying to<br/>\n&gt; \t\tcare people, perhaps it would be better to be known as<br/>\n&gt; Treilanin the you<br/>\n&gt; \t\tyellow bellied chicken ....
