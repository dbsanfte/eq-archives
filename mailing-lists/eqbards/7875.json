So the best route for talioring is Patchwork -&gt; Raw Silk -&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Studded<br/>\n&gt; &gt;armor -&gt; Reinforced Armor -&gt; Cured silk.  I am currently on the studded<br/>\n&gt; &gt;armor phase (skill 51).  Tailoring is a pain due to the scarcity of <br/>\n&gt;medium<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and high quality pelts/skins and the fact that you need to be a good <br/>\n&gt;smith<br/>\n&gt; &gt;or have a friend that is one to progress.  Good luck!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Master Craftsmen of Societus Argenti<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Don&#39;t know who told you that Rokenn but they sold you a bill of goods.  I<br/>\n&gt;succeed on 66% of Cured silk tunics at skill of 44.  I made my first one at<br/>\n&gt;35.  If you try Cured silk you should succeed a lot at 51 I think.  Either<br/>\n&gt;that or I am just the luckiest silk tailor in all of Norrath as I am<br/>\n&gt;currently 35 out of 53 for all my Cured Silk attempts rom skill 35 to 44.  <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;think its more likely it is now :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Patchwork<br/>\n&gt;Studded/Raw Silk\t(equal difficulty?  They said they lowered Studded)<br/>\n&gt;Cured Silk<br/>\n&gt;Reinforced Leather<br/>\n&gt;Magical Silk\t(Shadow Silk here soon?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will have to give cured silk another try.  I tried it once and failed 5 <br/>\ntimes in a row with a skill in the high 30&#39;s.  Raw silk it trival to me at <br/>\n51, but studded it not.  A friend of mine told me that studded trivs in the <br/>\nlow 60s (I think 63).   Time to go spider hunting tonight :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
