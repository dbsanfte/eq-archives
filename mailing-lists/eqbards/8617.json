I<br/>\nhave never seen or heard anyone auctioning any of the items before (granted<br/>\nI&#39;m not high enough level to go to the places they are found).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a 25th level bard, the only way I will be able to gather most of these<br/>\nquest components anytime in the near future is to buy them.  I will have to<br/>\ngain a few more levels before I can adventure in the places to loot them<br/>\nmyself.  It also appears that, with the exception of lambent stones, bards<br/>\nare the only class that need these items for their armor quests.  If this is<br/>\ntrue, then the market for buying these quest components should be fairly<br/>\nsmall.  The key will be if the quest components are NO DROP.  Does anyone<br/>\nknow if any of these quest components are NO DROP or can they be sold? <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
