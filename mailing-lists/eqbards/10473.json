I am about sick of camping<br/>\n&gt; Highpass Keep, and as looking for some yummier spots. (ie non boring)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am attaching a post I sent to EQ-Baking... This will explain to everyone<br/>\n&gt; how to get good baking skills with minimum cost.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Baking seems to be the only skill I could afford to get to master, due to<br/>\n&gt; its relativly low cost and VERY nice profit margin once you get a high<br/>\n&gt; skill. (As a Bard, 75 INT does not lend itself to learning skills)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Be sure and read the PS of my post below to learn to power bake yourself<br/>\n&gt; to 135.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For a primer on baking, goto <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loreseekers.com/guides/baking.html\">http://www.loreseekers.com/guides/baking.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Love,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Frashii (Vanitii?), 30th Strum Bard<br/>\n&gt; Seekers of Lore officer, Tarew Marr\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loreseekers.com\">http://www.loreseekers.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS.

Any bards on Tarew Marr who want to chat, please give me a /tell =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------ REPOST from EQ-Baking ------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once again, I&#39;ll rant about the benefits of fish fillets!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is the profit for fish fillets : (This is for the benefit of everone)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1 Fresh Fish (26 Copper) + 1 Jug of Sauce (10 Copper)<br/>\n&gt;                         = 2 Cakes that sell for 58 copper each<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Hence 36 copper becomes 116. Thats MORE THAN TRIPLE.<br/>\n&gt;         (Barring no failures)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Net result ? Backpack full of fish and backpack full of sauce<br/>\n&gt; yield 12.8pp when done, without failures.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do 2 sets of these, and you will prolly have paid for all the<br/>\n&gt; fish/batwings it took to get you to 120+ (see PS below) there<br/>\n&gt; is NO other skill out there that can recover your inital investment<br/>\n&gt; this quickly, AND have a great profit base for the forseeable future.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Point of reference, an enchanter friend of mine went to 135 in 2 hours,<br/>\n&gt; recovered all his investment, and was making a profit in 3).<br/>\n&gt; And get this... YOU CAN DO IT WHILE MEDDING! (Yes! that means<br/>\n&gt; all you finger wiggling bookworms can make money while you med!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other nice thing is that I was able to AFFORD to get my<br/>\n&gt; baking skill to 135 with a 75 INT. (Bards dont need INT)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Remember : The above is with 111 CHA and Aimiable faction.<br/>\n&gt; (Bards can &#39;faction bend themselves, and CHA is a primary<br/>\n&gt;  bard stat)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Love,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Frashii (Vanitii?), 30th String Bard<br/>\n&gt; Seekers of Lore Officer, Tarew Marr  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loreseekers.com\">http://www.loreseekers.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Master Baker (135), Just need to get some darn snake eggs to make pies<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS. Quick Recipie for &#39;power bakers&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Goto E. Freeport, buy 2 backpacks of fish at the docks.<br/>\n&gt; Goto W. Freeport, buy 2 backpacks of batwings at the Arcane Shop<br/>\n&gt;         (Magician Shop, 2nd floor, first woman on right)<br/>\n&gt; Make Fish Rolls, Welcome to Everclick!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wash.

Repeat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Fish Rolls triv out at 135, you are getting to about 120<br/>\n&gt;  to make the fillets (which triv out out 85) fail less)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I KNOW the above is not profitable, just easy, since the zones are<br/>\n&gt; right next to each other and you can do all this quickly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As an aside, I cook - I actually carry a spit around with me.  For a<br/>\n&gt; female<br/>\n&gt; &gt; half-elf bard this is really in character, plus it&#39;s a ton of fun.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cooking skill has gotten up to where I can make cookies, so I try to<br/>\n&gt; carry<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around cookies and milk and pass them out to folks that I like.  While<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is VERY entertaining, it also provides you and your group with an<br/>\n&gt; endless<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supply of Lizard-On-A-Stick, Beer Braised Gator, and Pickled Lizard.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; usual group members in Cazic-Thule now just say &quot;Hey Crier, rattle them<br/>\n&gt; pots<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and pans for me, I&#39;m low on food.&quot;  I normally buy my cooking supplies<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; East Commonlands at one of the bldgs adjacent to the first Inn, however,<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I run out of Sauces or Spices while in Cazic-Thule I run up to the Oggok<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gate in Feerrott and buy from Bup the vendor outside.  Bup is<br/>\n&gt; indifferent to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me, and was green the first time I ever conned him at 31st or 32nd.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only risk here is the wandering Bouncer, but I have yet to see one near<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; vendor.  He doesn&#39;t sell food, but he does sell milk if you get thirsty.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Otherwise the nearest &quot;good&quot; vendor is over in Rathe Mts. at the Inn or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gypsy camp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
