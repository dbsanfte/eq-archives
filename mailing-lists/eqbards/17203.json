I was previously playing a<br/>\nhalf elf bard, 11th song, named Jerrilia, on Luclin.  Because I enjoy<br/>\ntrade skills, and Jerrilia was just too dumb for them, I&#39;ve now started<br/>\na new bard, Adagia, who has now made her way to the 10th song, and<br/>\nprogressing nicely on her baking skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I found her adventures last night to be rather amusing.  Over<br/>\nand over I kept seeing examples of current discussions on the mail<br/>\nlist.  I started the evening in Steamfont, near the minotaur caves.  I<br/>\nmet a higher level druid who was sitting and healing himself (about half<br/>\nhealth).  Although I&#39;m sure he had means to heal himself, I invited him<br/>\nto my group so I could play the hymn for him.  While grouped and<br/>\nchatting, I found out that he also had a level 10 bard and wanted to<br/>\nknow if I&#39;d like to group with his bard.  Sure, sounds great - I needed<br/>\na hunting partner. <br/>\n<br/>\n(twinking) Well before the druid camped, he handed me some lambent<br/>\ngauntlets to give to the bard.  His bard was a self admitted twink,<br/>\nthanks to the druid.  After a bit, the bard showed up, and it was pretty<br/>\nobvious he was twinked.  Here was this level 10 wood elf bard, dressed<br/>\nhead to toe in bronze.  I gave him the gauntlets, and he very graciously<br/>\ngave me his old bronze gauntlets. :)  They look nice on Adagia, but I<br/>\nthink they are too heavy, I&#39;ll probably just stick to banded for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n(weaving)  Time to fight. I pull some mob (harpy or something) and we do<br/>\nok, but I notice the only song icons I see are my own.  After the<br/>\nbattle, I asked the other bard if he knew how to weave songs.  No.  Time<br/>\nfor a lesson - he does now.<br/>\n<br/>\n(take your beating)  A few battles later, a diseased rat decides to join<br/>\nin and starts hitting us while we were already down on hit points.  The<br/>\nrat really liked the other bard and his hitpoints were getting a bit<br/>\nlow.  I pulled out a harder hitting weapon and started playing the hymn,<br/>\nin hopes of pulling the rat off him.  Unfortunately the other bard kept<br/>\nrunning around in circles pulling the rat out of my view so I would<br/>\nmiss.  He said &quot;attack it!&quot;  and I replied &quot;stay still&quot; and then he<br/>\ndied.  sigh.  When he came back I explained to him how it is better to<br/>\nstay still, stop fighting and take the beating so I could pull off the<br/>\nmob.  We didn&#39;t have any more trouble after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, I had a good time with this bard.  Once he learned a few<br/>\nbasics we made a great team.  I just chuckled everytime I saw an example<br/>\nof one this list&#39;s recent discussions.  Oh, and the best part - just<br/>\nminutes after commenting on the lack of minotaur horns on the minotaur<br/>\nslavers, and right after saying I needed to camp and could only fight<br/>\none more mob, I spotted a slaver with a horn in his hand!  I now have my<br/>\nown horn.  Can&#39;t use it yet, but it was fun getting my first dropped<br/>\nbard item.  (The other bard already have one, courtesy of his druid :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAdagia, Bard of the the 10th song<br/>\nLuclin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
