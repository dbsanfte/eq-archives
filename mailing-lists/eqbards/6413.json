Its sad when a level 14 npc is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; pounding the hell out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of a 31th level pc. I just decided to not take any chances <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with him. And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; upon zoning into Sro afterwards, i saw terrorantula, but was <br/>\n&gt; &gt; alone and not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking any chances against it, since i would have needed to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; charm a giant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; against it so it was too dangerous for me and my untrusty ISP.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nothing kills me more then my connectivity.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Minkin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sol ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard of the 31st level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BETA TEST expertcity.com&#39;s new online, real-time, technical <br/>\n&gt; support service!<br/>\n&gt;    Let our live experts help you with your computer now.
