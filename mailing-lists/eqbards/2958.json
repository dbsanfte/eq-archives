If you are unsure if you have a WINModem,<br/>\nanswer these questions:<br/>\nIs it internal? (If yes, continue)<br/>\nIs it a USRobotics/3COM? (If no, continue)<br/>\nIs it from some &#39;other&#39; modem maker you have never heard of? (if yes,<br/>\ncontinue)<br/>\nIs your computer &#39;pre-made&#39; with a modem, i.e. Packard Bell?

My system is pretty high<br/>\n&gt; &gt;end (Celeron 450, 128MB RAM, Voodoo 3 card) and ever since I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;got the extra lights at L24, unless I turn particle density<br/>\n&gt; &gt;off (meaning I don&#39;t see spell effects like root at all), I go<br/>\n&gt; &gt;from twisting 3 songs easily to barely twisting 2.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thinking of changing my video card because a friend with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Riva TNT said it wasn&#39;t that bad on her system (same CPU<br/>\n&gt; &gt;speed, RAM).  Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with lots of spells flying?  What video card do you use?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The thing that really irks me about this is that it&#39;s a client<br/>\n&gt; &gt;side problem.  The determination that &quot;you haven&#39;t yet<br/>\n&gt; &gt;recovered&quot; to sing another song is completely client side, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;completely dependent on the speed of your system.  When I had<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a P200 with a Voodoo 1, it took ages for the song buttons to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;un-grey when I stopped singing.  When I upgraded to my current<br/>\n&gt; &gt;system, it was almost instant, except as noted above when lots<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of spells are flying.  I would prefer to be able to turn off<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the button un-grey animation sequence and suffer a flat time<br/>\n&gt; &gt;delay which doesn&#39;t change with CPU speed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--<br/>\n&gt; &gt;John H.
