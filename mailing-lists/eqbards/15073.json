It&#39;s like 20 hp regen and adds ac. Still<br/>\nthough bards got a nice round of songs can you think of many that would keep<br/>\nbalance in?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing though that really pissed me of this patch was that my level 50<br/>\ndark elf necromancer is kos in Paineel the necro city! Heck you think I<br/>\nwould at leats be dubious. I got my faction to dubious by killing guards but<br/>\nit maxed out there. I seriously hope somebody finds a way to get warmly<br/>\nbecause I want to be able to enter the necro city.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tim Burke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tjohnburke@...\">tjohnburke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, February 18, 2000 1:40 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Welp... it was me :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Tim Burke&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tjohnburke@...\">tjohnburke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was the bard who spoke up, said my piece after the patch.
