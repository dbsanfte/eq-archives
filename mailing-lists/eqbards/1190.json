I usually drink short beer, and have<br/>\n&gt;found even with his 60 int, I raised a point in alcohol tolerance every <br/>\n&gt;time<br/>\n&gt;I drank one. My Barb has 130str and 110sta, and after getting completely<br/>\n&gt;wasted, they both go up 20 points (my alcohol tolerance is now 120). I make<br/>\n&gt;it a point to carry a backpack full of beer and down a few every time I <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;a duel or am fighting a high level monster. It&#39;s like having temporary<br/>\n&gt;Berserk (what happens when Warriors get low on HP). Berserk basically<br/>\n&gt;increases your hit%, damage, and hit speed. Anything that does that works<br/>\n&gt;for me!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     In a Bards case, alcohol tolerance, IMHO should actually INCREASE the<br/>\n&gt;effects of our songs. For instance, when I was playing in a band I played<br/>\n&gt;100 times better when I was completely hammered. In the sense Verant is<br/>\n&gt;using it, being drunk seems to enhance a characters specialty (ie. Warriors<br/>\n&gt;fight better and main stats increase), so why shouldn&#39;t Bards become more<br/>\n&gt;rambunctious and charismatic?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--Danner Bramblethorn<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I dunno, I guess some people take it differently. When I&#39;m hammered I look <br/>\nat my guitar and try to play and I feel as if i&#39;ve never played before in my <br/>\nlife. I have a hard time doing anything other than basic chords.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 11th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
