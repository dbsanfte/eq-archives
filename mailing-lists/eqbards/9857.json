The original poster got it off another board, EQCastersRealm I<br/>\nbelieve.  The poster on that board apparently made his inferences based on a<br/>\nconversation with GZ.  <br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nConcert Hall post:<br/>\nre: Agility vs. AC <br/>\nby Kellen \tposted 11/10/99 11:41:40 AM \t<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the gist of the post is what the role of STR, DEX, AGI, AC and ATK<br/>\nin combat. Using a statement made by GZ of Verant (I forget the exact<br/>\nquote), when he was asked a similar question by the monks, the following was<br/>\nrevealed:<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Hit:<br/>\n<br/>\nAttacker&#39;s ATK rating vs. Opponent&#39;s Defense Skill and Agility <br/>\n<br/>\nAmount of Damage:<br/>\n<br/>\nAttacker&#39;s Weapon DMG + Weapon Skill + Strength Bonuses vs. Opponent&#39;s AC,<br/>\nDefense Skill and Agility.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth are calculated using a die-roll (random number) so they&#39;re not<br/>\nconsistent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway... <br/>\n<br/>\nATK rating is calculated using Weapon Skill, Offense Skill, and Strength<br/>\nAC is calculated using Defense Skill, Agility, and Equipment<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that DEX is *not* used in calculating &quot;to hit&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does DEX and AGI do?<br/>\n<br/>\nDEX - used to determine how often weapon procs. used to determine critical<br/>\nhits (melee and range weapons). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is unconfirmed but is generally accepted:<br/>\n<br/>\nDEX - used to determine how often dual wield/double attack goes off<br/>\nAGI - used to determine how often dodge/parry/block/riposte goes off<br/>\n<br/>\nSince bards are capped too low for dodge, I wouldn&#39;t use it as a reason to<br/>\nbump up agility. The main reason is to get hit less and get less damage from<br/>\nhits, per above. AC is just as important however so find a balance between<br/>\nthe two.<br/>\n<br/>\nKellen, Songweaver of the 50th Hymn<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i remember this patch in beta.  what i believe happened is not the type of<br/>\n&gt; armor affecting how hard you are hit, but how much the AC stat of each<br/>\n&gt; type<br/>\n&gt; of armor contributed to your total overall AC.  i remember lots of casters<br/>\n&gt; yelling how they lost as much as 100 AC points from their total, as i was<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; wizard and remember well.  i.e. plate armor will add more over and above<br/>\n&gt; its<br/>\n&gt; actual AC stat than will cloth armor.  therefore your total AC goes up<br/>\n&gt; differently based on your level, agility, defense skill, and armor type.<br/>\n&gt; i<br/>\n&gt; do not know if plate armor has more absorbing value, just that it adds<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; AC over and above its stats.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; just a theory, i could be totally off-base.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt; Tyria Sarkin, L29 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Manda D&#39;ulin, L21 Wood Elf Warrior<br/>\n&gt; Erisi Dlarit, L24 High Elf Paladin (in stasis)<br/>\n&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sartori,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I want to believe that you are 100% correct.  However, gonna <br/>\n&gt; &gt; put on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; devil&#39;s advocate hat here for the sake of discussion.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; First:  There is a big difference between the AC of a caster <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the AC of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone wearing platemail, especially if they are the same <br/>\n&gt; &gt; level.  The only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way a caster will have a higher AC over a plate wearing class <br/>\n&gt; &gt; is if they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; higher in level and get the benefit of a higher Defense skill <br/>\n&gt; &gt; rating.  In<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the observations where you have seen casters getting hit for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; more damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than plate wearers, were the casters a lot higher in level or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; similar in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level to the plate wearing classes?  If they were a lot <br/>\n&gt; &gt; higher in level and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; therefore, in theory, had AC values that were close to one <br/>\n&gt; &gt; another, then the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fact that the caster was getting hit for more damage than the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; platemail<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wearer could be attributed to the platemail deflecting part <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the blow.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the caster and platemail wearer were similar in levels, I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can compare the two.  The platemail wearer would almost <br/>\n&gt; &gt; certainly have had a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; higher AC than the caster and therefore shouldn&#39;t have been <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hit for as much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
