In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-885200225\">February 17th, 7:00am<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n***Announcements***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe City of Paineel, home to the infamous Heretics of Erudin, is now <br/>\navailable via the Optional Patch. In addition, Erudites may now also be <br/>\nShadowknights in addition to the other classes available to them. All <br/>\nErudite Necromancers, Shadowknights, and Clerics who worship the God of <br/>\nFear, Cazic-Thule, now start in the City of Paineel. As such, if you wish to <br/>\ncreate a character of this type from this point forward, you *must* download <br/>\nthe Paineel zone-files via the Optional Patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note that if you downloaded the Paineel zone files recently, you must <br/>\nrun the Optional Patch again to insure you have the correct version of the <br/>\nfiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn related news, all of the entrances to the Qeynos Catacombs have been <br/>\nfixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Patch Message***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following changes have been implemented on the live servers:<br/>\n<br/>\n*Spell Changes*<br/>\n<br/>\n- The recast delay for many of the Shaman buff-spells have been reduced.<br/>\n- &quot;Reoccurring Amnesia&quot; has had its casting time reduced.<br/>\n- &quot;Yaulp&quot; and &quot;Augmentation&quot; should now stack.<br/>\n- &quot;Solidarity of Vision&quot; has had its duration increased.<br/>\n- The Druid spell, &quot;Skin Like Nature&quot;, has been returned to its former <br/>\nstatus due to popular opinion. As such, the damage-shield component has been <br/>\nremoved and the regeneration component has been re-applied.<br/>\n- &quot;Sense Magic&quot; has been replaced in all cases by the &quot;True North&quot; spell. If <br/>\nyou have already inscribed the &quot;Sense Magic&quot; spell, the spell icon will now <br/>\nautomatically reflect &quot;True North&quot;.<br/>\n- A bug that existed with several damage-shield spells, causing their damage <br/>\nto be subtracted rather than added when stacked, has been corrected. The <br/>\nspells will now stack properly.<br/>\n- The &quot;Feign Death&quot; spell, when cast by a Necromancer, will now have a fixed <br/>\nduration. The<br/>\nNecromancer will receive several warnings prior to the spell wearing off. <br/>\nThis change was necessary because some Necromancers found a way to gain <br/>\nexperience through their pet while being AFK for an extended duration, such <br/>\nas being in bed for the night. Note: This does not affect Shadowknights or <br/>\nMonks.<br/>\n- New Necromancer spells are now in game. Check your spell vendors.<br/>\n- Alchemy has been revamped. Check with your local Shaman.<br/>\n- DOT (Damage Over Time) spells will no longer hinder camping.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*General Changes/Fixes*<br/>\n<br/>\n- The dungeon of Paw has again received a minor update to slightly reduce <br/>\nthe difficulty of the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n- All known issues with the SBLive soundcard have been corrected.<br/>\n<br/>\n- From this point forward, deleting a character will cause all corpses <br/>\nbelonging to that character to likewise be deleted. This change was made <br/>\nprimarily to stop a no-drop transfer bug. It also has the added effect of <br/>\ncleaning up corpses for characters that people no longer intend to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Crippling Blows will now display the correct damage in the &quot;You have <br/>\nscored a Crippling Blow (###)&quot; line.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Corpse Looting Exploit*<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, an exploit was discovered that allowed certain unsavory <br/>\nindividuals to loot the corpses of other players without their consent. The <br/>\nprecise symptom of this is that the owner would find their corpse stripped <br/>\nof everything except for no-drop items, and items in a bag with no-drop <br/>\nitems. This exploit was fixed in this patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were affected by this exploit recently, you are entitled to a <br/>\nreimbursement of your lost items<br/>\nassuming that we still have a record of what you had. Please contact a GM <br/>\nin-game to arrange for an investigation.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the course of the investigation, people who have exploited this bug <br/>\nwill be subject to disciplinary action by our GM staff up to and including <br/>\nitem wipes, suspension, and/or banishment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Rogue Enhancements*<br/>\n<br/>\nRogues received several enhancements as part of this patch:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The chance to score a critical hit with a throwing weapon has been <br/>\nincreased significantly.<br/>\n<br/>\n- When throwing a weapon from behind the NPC in question, a rogue now has a <br/>\nchance to score a &quot;Deadly Strike&quot;, for enhanced damage above and beyond that <br/>\nof a critical hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A new rogue-specific ability has been added to the &quot;Hide&quot; skill. It is <br/>\ncalled &quot;Evade&quot;. This skill has the effect of lowering the amount that the <br/>\ntargeted NPC hates the rogue, and has the potential of making the engaged <br/>\nNPC switch to another target (preferably a tank) within the rogue&#39;s group. <br/>\nIt is essentially a &quot;reverse taunt&quot;. This ability helps mitigate the <br/>\nnegative effects of the rogue&#39;s exceedingly high damage-output potential. It <br/>\nalso will in-turn help the rogue do even more damage as the NPC is much more <br/>\nlikely to expose its back. It is engaged by targeting the NPC you wish to <br/>\n&quot;Evade&quot; and pressing the &quot;Hide&quot; button. As a note, you must not be in combat <br/>\nmode in order to use this ability.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Mistwalker*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mistwalker will once again cast its spell as often as it used to prior <br/>\nto the last patch. However, the resulting pet will now automatically <br/>\n&quot;dissipate&quot; after one combat round. The change that reduced the &quot;proc&quot; <br/>\npercentage on the weapon was made due to an unintended interaction between <br/>\nthe pet and the target when several users of this weapon were attacking the <br/>\nsame target. Since the new pet now automatically dissipates after one round, <br/>\nthe reduced &quot;proc&quot; percentage was no longer necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Class-Specific Armor Quests*<br/>\n<br/>\nClass-Specific armor quests, especially those belonging to Clerics, <br/>\nPaladins, and Shadowknights, have been reduced in terms of how long it will <br/>\ntake the average person to acquire the armor. These classes, and others that <br/>\nfound particular pieces of their armor exceedingly difficult to obtain <br/>\nshould find it much easier now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, a bug that hindered completion of the Bracer of Ro quest for <br/>\nsome races has been<br/>\ncorrected.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Tallon Zek*<br/>\n<br/>\nLoot rules for PvP deaths on the PvP-Teams server, Tallon Zek, have been <br/>\nchanged from &quot;Coin + 1 item&quot; to &quot;Coin Only&quot;. This change was made to study <br/>\nthe impact of loot-rules upon server population in reference to the <br/>\nloot/efficiency disparity between caster and melee characters. This change <br/>\nis a test, and may or may not be retained or rolled out across the other PvP <br/>\nservers, pending the results of the server population study over the next <br/>\nfew weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Plane Changes*<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral changes have been implemented in the Planes as part of this patch:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Characters will now lose all enchantments upon entering the Plane of Sky<br/>\n<br/>\n- Due to the fact that the levitate-series no longer works within the Plane <br/>\nof Sky, a teleporter has been placed to allow entrance into the quest room.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A teleporter has been placed within the Plane of Hate in order to give <br/>\nnon-casters a way out of the zone besides death, potion, or group teleport.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Loot Messages*<br/>\n<br/>\nMessages indicating what has been looted from a corpse will now be broadcast <br/>\nto everyone within the looters group. This change was made due to public <br/>\nrequest and to encourage trust within the group. We may, in the future, <br/>\nemploy filters to allow people to choose whether or not they wish to receive <br/>\nloot messages.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Fiery Avenger*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe greatly anticipated defining blade of the Paladin, the &quot;Fiery Avenger&quot;, <br/>\nis again available within game via a quest. The *first* devout Paladin to <br/>\nwield this blade and be validated by a GM in-game will be publicly <br/>\ncongratulated within a patch message and on the Official EverQuest web-site <br/>\nat www.everquest.com.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
