AFAIK, Guardian stacks with<br/>\nanything except Chant of Battle - Elemental and Purifying<br/>\nRhythms, and all the Psalm series stack with Guardian.

In contrast, Anthem is only +21<br/>\nto str and a ~10% speedup (which is overridden by all the<br/>\nenchanter&#39;s speedup spells I&#39;ve tested - everything but<br/>\nCelerity).  The tanks in my groups love it, and usually start<br/>\ncomparing each others&#39; str and dex when I&#39;m playing it.  The<br/>\nenchanter usually keeps augmentation on everyone (~15%<br/>\nspeedup), so Anthem ends up only being a str buff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Bleh - a non-twinked L20 bard has better weapons than I do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I need to get better weapons.  Doesn&#39;t help that my friends<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I aren&#39;t into camping...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I despise camping.  It&#39;s the main reason that I don&#39;t have a steady group.  I<br/>\n&gt; get very restless very fast.  That&#39;s yet another reason I started a bard -<br/>\n&gt; like a lot of the others on this list I like to travel around.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I finally picked up a silvery war axe last night - my first<br/>\nweapon upgrade since L19 (I&#39;m 33 now).  I know what you mean<br/>\nabout camping - after the first couple rounds in the area, I<br/>\nwanted to move on (even though it was my first time there).<br/>\nThe other folks wanted backup gear and trade items though,<br/>\nsince we rarely camp anything and thus have very little to<br/>\ntrade.  Then the kill stealers moved in and we left (when will<br/>\nVerant realize how incredibly stupid it is for 1 player to be<br/>\nable to kill steal from and ruin the enjoyment of the game for<br/>\n10 players?).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
