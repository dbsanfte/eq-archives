In Nurga the mobs are<br/>\nwonderfully spread out in twos and threes and would be great exp for a group<br/>\nof 5 or 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a great change of pace for invis to be useful in Kunark.  ;-/<br/>\n<br/>\n[51 Minstrel] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Switching subjects here, but I question the value of invisibility now.<br/>\n&gt; Whats the rationale on why most mobs in Kunark see thru invis?  In my<br/>\n&gt; experience with the older zones, the only mobs that could see thru invis<br/>\n&gt; were undead and any mob that could cast the See Invis spell.  I&#39;ve walked<br/>\n&gt; completely thru Mistmoore with invis song up and everything I saw conned<br/>\n&gt; Indifferent.  Almost all of the mobs that were in there were yellow or<br/>\n&gt; higher to me.  I realize there were a few other mobs that could see thru<br/>\n&gt; invis but they were the exception not the norm.  Now it seems that for the<br/>\n&gt; most part invisibility in Kunark is almost worthless.  I&#39;ve been fighting<br/>\n&gt; the giants in Frontier Mtns and everyone one of them see thru invis even<br/>\n&gt; though they are lower than 35th level.  So red mobs in Mistmoore can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; me but blue mobs in Frontier Mtns can?  Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>\n&gt;  Also, by<br/>\n&gt; the time a warrior is high enough level to get the armor that gives this<br/>\n&gt; effect, almost everything he will be fighting can see thru invis because<br/>\n&gt; they are a high level mob.  So I would imagine a lot of them view getting<br/>\n&gt; Invisibility in their armor almost as much as we view getting Summon Water<br/>\n&gt; as worthless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
