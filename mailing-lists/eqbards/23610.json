I moderate another Egroup<br/>\nmailing list and got a notification several weeks back of the impending<br/>\nchange.  However, I didn&#39;t get a notification anytime recently announcing<br/>\nthe change was gonna happen today.  I tried to access my guild&#39;s Egroups<br/>\nwebsite today and before I could access it, I had to register for a Yahoo<br/>\nID.  Once I registered for the Yahoo ID, all of my subscriptions to the<br/>\nEgroups lists I belong to were automatically converted over to Yahoo.  I<br/>\nbelieve you only need to get a Yahoo ID/email account if you intend to use<br/>\nthe other features available on the eqbards mailing list website (chat,<br/>\ncalendar, database, etc).  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Windleaf Mistsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:windleaf@...\">windleaf@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 26, 2001 11:36 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Yahoogroups?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s with this Yahoogroups thing?
