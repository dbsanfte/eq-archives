Granted the ability to use guild chat makes communication<br/>\neasier (although once in the plane - isn&#39;t Shout the equivalent)?  People<br/>\nuse shout in Sol B all the time for Fire Giant Raids.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I can understand the concern for having people you trust to know how to<br/>\nplay their chars and not &quot;ninja-loot&quot;.  But unless I&#39;m missing something -<br/>\nthis concept is what causes people in smaller guilds to complain of<br/>\n&quot;uber-guilds&quot; and &quot;Character Stealing&quot;.  Is it TRULY necessary to have a<br/>\nsingle guild complete these events?<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde 41 of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
