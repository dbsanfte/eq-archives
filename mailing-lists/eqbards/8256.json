I just want to give Verant a state-of-the-union update on Bards<br/>\nin<br/>\ngeneral.  Since we seem to be a low-population class, I don&#39;t think we enter<br/>\nmuch into the minds of the developers. I hope this will give them something<br/>\nto<br/>\nwork with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list should include a SHORT synopsis of what the issue is, and they<br/>\nshould<br/>\naffect Bards only.  No solutions are needed, as this is not a complaint or<br/>\npetition letter.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know if you see missed items.  Please, no single item/single<br/>\nmob<br/>\nsuggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias, Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Bard Melee Skills<br/>\n<br/>\nAll classes currently get Dodge.  In addition, each hybrid or melee class<br/>\ngets 5<br/>\nto 7 additional skills.  Bards get one single skill, dual wield.  Since<br/>\nBards<br/>\nare usually very popular among the mobs attacking a party, due to party<br/>\nbuffs<br/>\nand healing, the lack of other defensive skills seems odd.  As a side note,<br/>\nwe<br/>\nseem to be Rogue/All Caster hybrids...but Rogues get all melee skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Mob Hatred<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is tied to number one.  Mobs choose their targets based on perceived<br/>\ndamage<br/>\nto them. Buffs, healing, and taunt count as damage.  This is fine for all<br/>\nclasses except Bards.  Most non-bard buffing occurs outside of combat, no<br/>\neffect<br/>\non mobs.  Most non-bard healing takes place on a single character, less of<br/>\nit<br/>\nhappens on the whole party, tho it does happen with high level clerics.  In<br/>\nthe<br/>\nBard&#39;s case, during a fight we are generating hate for ALL mobs based on<br/>\nbuffing/healing ALL characters and doing it every few seconds.  So we get<br/>\nmaximum hate added to EACH mob, based on helping the whole party. And it<br/>\nhappens<br/>\nwith every pulse of every song.  Coupled with a lack of defensive skills,<br/>\nthis<br/>\nmakes the life of a party bard pretty difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Charm Level Cap<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a song that we get at level 27, and is only effective on mobs up to<br/>\nlevel 37.  Having spells with caps on most casting classes is<br/>\nunderstandable, as<br/>\nthey get a higher circle spell that replaces it.  In addition, most casters<br/>\nhave<br/>\nover 100 songs, where we have only 50, once they are all implemented.  The<br/>\ncharm<br/>\nis already difficult to use, I.E. the charm will typically wear off before<br/>\nyou<br/>\ncan type a single pet command, and the mob can&#39;t be recharmed till it has<br/>\ntime<br/>\nto smack you.  Does it need a level cap as well?  If this is song is so<br/>\nlimited,<br/>\nperhaps it should be replaced with something else, considering how few songs<br/>\nwe<br/>\nhave?<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Bard Only Weapons<br/>\n<br/>\nNuff said.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Instrument Skill Caps<br/>\n<br/>\nInstrument skill caps are the Bardic equivalent of a caster&#39;s Evocation,<br/>\nDivination, etc. skills.  All casters cap at 255 in these skills, where<br/>\nBards<br/>\ninstruments cap at 200.  This leads to many &#39;fizzles&#39; at high level, many<br/>\nmore<br/>\nthan an equivalent caster.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
