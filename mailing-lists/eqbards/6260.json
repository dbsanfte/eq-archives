THIS is what i did not know, and what kept me from using charm for<br/>\nso long.  it is a lot easier than i thought.  once you charm and /pet attack<br/>\nonce, you can keep your pet as your current target because as soon as you<br/>\nrecharm, it goes back to its last command.  boy i wish i knew and used this<br/>\nsong a lot more during previous levels.  silly battle bard me.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada D&#39;ukal, Level 50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nErisi Dlarit, Level 22 High Elf Paladin<br/>\nTyria, Level 12 High Elf Wizard<br/>\nMithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Just wait until you are level 40 though, and the fun with <br/>\n&gt; giants really begins.<br/>\n&gt; Every other class I know except druids whines they can&#39;t solo <br/>\n&gt; generally, and I<br/>\n&gt; do so often. 2 giants, a giant + griffin, etc are extremely <br/>\n&gt; easy to control.<br/>\n&gt; However, I do not use selo&#39;s, because if you get bashed you <br/>\n&gt; are at the giant&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; mercy.
