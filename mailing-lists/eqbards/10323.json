The way Verant<br/>\ndescribed it was the way FD was supposed to be working prior to the patch.<br/>\nThere was a bug in the code that caused it to work not as Verant thought it<br/>\ndid, but as Yeti and others had observed it to.  According to GZ after the<br/>\nnext patch it will work 100% below level 35 totally and as reported after<br/>\nthat, IF there are no other bugs in the code that are in effect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also said interestingly that the reason it did not work before the patch<br/>\nas advertised was that the code for them forgetting was supposed to be an<br/>\nexact copy of the code for forgetting a mob that had hopelessly outrun them<br/>\n(as we often see in effect in w karana with bandits).  The code however was<br/>\ncopied before they fixed the bug in the code for outrunning and the<br/>\ncorrected outrunning code was never pasted back into FD.  So the answer is<br/>\nbasically yes, Yeti is right, and Verant thought they were right and only<br/>\ndiscovered they were not when they found the bug in the previous code.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rokenn Swiftsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 18, 1999 1:49 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Bards@onelist.com\">EQ-Bards@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQBards@onelist.com\">EQBards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] OT: Feign Death nerf (long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am reposting this from the Monk MB <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://server3.ezboard.com/feverquestmonksfeigndeathnerf.html)\">http://server3.ezboard.com/feverquestmonksfeigndeathnerf.html)</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have known Yeti since Beta 3 (when he was known as Orcus).  He is one of <br/>\nthe most knowledgable players I have every met in the game.  The upcoming <br/>\nnerf to Feign Death will effect all players, not just Monks, Shadow Knights,<br/>\n<br/>\nand Necros.<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nI would like to provide the community with information so they can <br/>\nunderstand the nature of Verant&#39;s changes to FD. The changes are <br/>\nsignificant, a nerf, and their news message was misleading.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you were within sight, they would immediately come after you.&quot; - No, <br/>\nthey came back based on aggro radius. If you saw them wander away to a safe <br/>\ndistance, you could get up without training anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If not, they would come after you at some later point. This might happen <br/>\nwithin a few minutes, or could happen even a few hours later&quot; - This was not<br/>\n<br/>\nrandom, but the result of game mechanics understood by experienced feigners.<br/>\n<br/>\nA feigned upon mob has you in its aggro list. If someone else re-aggros the <br/>\nmob to a lesser degree than the original feigner, it will return to the <br/>\nfeigner. Feigners knew this! If the mobs were in front of them in a room, <br/>\nthey knew no one would disturb them and all was fine. If the mobs were <br/>\nscattered around the dungeon by a train wandering home, they knew to zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;.... Four times means about 20 percent ....&quot; - These numbers seem totally <br/>\ninaccurate. I had to feign 11 times on a green guard and 10 times on a <br/>\nknight while testing in Freeport. If ANY of your feign attempts fails (xxxx <br/>\nhas fallen to the ground) then the mob comes running back. NO OTHER SKILL <br/>\ntakes 4 or more successful skill checks in a row to perform a single act. If<br/>\n<br/>\nyou have multiple mobs, it is almost impossible to fool them all. If even <br/>\none is not fooled, it will build a train as it runs to you - quite possibly <br/>\nfrom so far out of sight that you don&#39;t even know you are killing other <br/>\nplayers.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeign used to be predictable. If you were successful against a mob that can <br/>\nbe fooled (some couldn&#39;t be - this was a matter of experience and feigners <br/>\nknew which mobs to avoid), it would never come back unless re-aggroed by <br/>\nanother player. Verant implies otherwise, but it is NOW that the skill is <br/>\ntotally unpredictable, with mobs that are far out of sight deep in the <br/>\ndungeon randomly returning, based on percentages apparently much worse than <br/>\nthose Verant gave and which are useless against multiple mobs. Stand up, and<br/>\n<br/>\na feigner doesn&#39;t know if he is killing people far out of sight, or has <br/>\nsafely cleared aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore a player had to re-aggro a mob in such a way that the feigner was <br/>\nstill higher on its aggro list (such as by coming very close, but doing no <br/>\ndamage), and in this case it was usually only the feigner that was in <br/>\ndanger. Now every time a feigner stands up mobs can come training from <br/>\neverywhere, and if he feigns again because he sees them coming, they will <br/>\nattack anyone nearby or in their path home.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeign pulling is still possible, although harder. Feign twinking/leveling <br/>\nothers is still possible, and should actually be easier. Feigning to avoid <br/>\ndeath or trains now results in far more trains. What are these &quot;evolving <br/>\ngameplay issues&quot; that Verant hoped to address? In what way was this supposed<br/>\n<br/>\nto make this a better game?<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask that the EQ community understand this is not just a nerf to SKs, <br/>\nNecromancers, and Monks, but to anyone that has ever grouped with them or <br/>\neven played in a dungeon, and invite you to provide /feedback in game to <br/>\nvoice your opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for listening, Yeti (Level 50 monk, Karana server)<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
