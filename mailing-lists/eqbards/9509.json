It was good to see Verant<br/>\nmaking some real storyline related changes to a zone.  I just wish they<br/>\ncould effectively do those sort of things at a lower level, say in the 25<br/>\nrange instead of 40.  Problem is, all those 40+ level characters would flood<br/>\nthe zone anyway just to kill everything to see what it dropped, depriving<br/>\npeople of an appropriate level from participating.<br/>\nI&#39;ll be really surprised if Asheron&#39;s Call is much of a threat to EQ.  From<br/>\nwhat I saw in Beta it was no match for EQ despite the problems in EQ.<br/>\nThere were some really sweet weapons a bard could use on some of those<br/>\nundead apparently.  sadly I was unable to get any even though most of the<br/>\npeople I saw fighting them would have zero use for them.  Its a bit<br/>\nirritating to watch a 50th level paladin scooping up no drop piercing<br/>\nweapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wethington@...\">wethington@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 02, 1999 1:33 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Undead drops in Kithicor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kevin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wethington@...\">wethington@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMethinks you are being a bit harsh on Verant.  The Kithicor and Lake Rathe<br/>\nevents are probably testing grounds for some kind of changes to the zones.<br/>\nVerant has so few people on the Test Server that they have to do things on<br/>\nlive servers to see how things will actually work.  Trust me Verant has 1.5<br/>\nmillion reasons per month to want you to be happy.  With the retail release<br/>\nof Asheron&#39;s Call yesterday I think Verant is going to be very aggressive in<br/>\nretaining and growing their current player base.  I don&#39;t envy them having<br/>\nto compete against Microsoft.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Side note: everyone in the zone was saying &quot;I hope hope leave it this<br/>\n&gt; way forever&quot; just like last week in Lake rathe when the pets were<br/>\n&gt; spawning like crazy and everypne was saying &quot;I hope it stays this way&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; TWO examples of people LOVING a zone, BOTH of which Verant KABONG&#39;ed.<br/>\n&gt; Makes you wonder if they really WANT us happy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Uldar Ulfangson<br/>\n&gt; 25th bard, Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
