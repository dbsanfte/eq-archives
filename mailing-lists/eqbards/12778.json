Not so curiously, they rarely seem to believe <br/>\nthat a Bard can reap the most benefit from anything.  They&#39;re correct, of <br/>\ncourse.  Still, while the concept of giving items to the person who can best <br/>\nutilize them may be fine in a single-player RPG (where an individual is trying to <br/>\nmaximize the performance of his &quot;team&quot;), it makes no sense to me in EQ.  If these <br/>\nwere players that I intended to play with day in and day out for the next several <br/>\nmonths, I might buy it, but I don&#39;t buy it when these are players I may never <br/>\ngroup with again.  What possible advantage is it to ME to maximize THEIR <br/>\nutility?  If it&#39;s an item I can use, if it&#39;s better than what I have, and if I <br/>\nfought for it, I really don&#39;t get why I shouldn&#39;t be in a lottery for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do like what Shada&#39;s guild does for the Planes and Dragons (I&#39;m not high enough <br/>\nto be fighting them), though.  It seems like a nice way to make sure that people <br/>\ndon&#39;t get overly lucky or overly unlucky when it comes to special/rare drops.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 36 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
