Up until it&#39;s use on this list it used to mean relatively good at<br/>\nsomething as compared to true master. Are you claiming that bard&#39;s<br/>\nforaging and hiding skills could be called relatively good? If so, would<br/>\nthat be relative to someone who had none at all or to someone who was<br/>\nrelatively bad?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs EQ has seen fit to redefine master as 101 out of a possible 200-255<br/>\nskill it&#39;s important we have a clear understanding of relatively good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be interesting to get a list poll up to see how many<br/>\nbards on the list actually use forage or hide, or even have them in<br/>\ntheir hotkeys. We&#39;d have to have a seperate section for wood elf bards<br/>\nas the wood elf natural cap is actually 10 higher than the default<br/>\nbard&#39;s (hmm, another contradiction to the jack of foraging idea)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
