I bought the binding song 3 days ago.  I do not see<br/>\nany slowness on the Mob at all in attack even though the text said that it<br/>\nis bind.  I was wondering what songs all bards are using for outside<br/>\nadventure: solo and group, and dungeons in group?  I find myself still using<br/>\nthe lvl 1, 7, and 12 song in combat.  I am using the lvl 7 song because<br/>\nsomehow I am the attention of the fight, hehe.  The other AE song is useless<br/>\nin dungeons because you will attract too many MOB and most of our higher<br/>\nsong are AE.  So please inform me of what song you all use so I can be a<br/>\nmore effective bard in my group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Syren Wind<br/>\nChampions of Norrath, The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
