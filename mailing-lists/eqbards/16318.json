This pretty much locks us out<br/>\n&gt; of any chance of ever getting rare drops.  We can only play with enough of<br/>\n&gt; us to do tough camps once every other week pretty much anyhow.  Giving us<br/>\n&gt; the ability to get a chance at the spawn every nite while reducing our<br/>\n&gt; ability to camp the spawn longer gains us exactly zero access, while<br/>\n&gt; reducing the access we did have.  None of my regular groupmates plays more<br/>\n&gt; than 4 times a week and those are the ones who can solo easily.  Once a week<br/>\n&gt; is the most often we get more than three guildmembers together.  From our<br/>\n&gt; experience the new rules will not increase our access as casual players, but<br/>\n&gt; exactly the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like your problem is you don&#39;t know enough people<br/>\nyou&#39;re willing to group with for a shot at one of these named<br/>\nmobs.  The access is there, you&#39;re just unwilling to take<br/>\nadvantage of it because of whom you choose to group with.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a variant of the problem solo players complain about -<br/>\nthat they can&#39;t really kill most of the named spawns solo<br/>\nunless it&#39;s way green to them.  This is a grouping game.  If<br/>\nyour grouping is sub-par, you&#39;re going to miss out no matter<br/>\nthe rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
