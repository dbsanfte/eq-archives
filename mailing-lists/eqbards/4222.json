I receive over<br/>\n200 messages a day from several mailing lists, family, friends.  I don&#39;t have<br/>\nany idea what most of these acronyms are and when I find them in a message I am<br/>\ncurious as to what they mean, but as before mentioned, I still have 200 or more<br/>\nmessages to read.  This leaves me little time to reply to people, let alone go<br/>\nto a web site with an EverQuest dictionary.  Nor do I contain any desire to go<br/>\nthere and look up a word each time.<br/>\n     Here&#39;s a good one for you, everyone pretty much knows what a zipper is, or<br/>\nhas one on a least one article of clothing, but when i told my 10 year old<br/>\nnephew to XYZ-PDQ he had no clue what I was talking about.  In other words,<br/>\njust because I play the game doesn&#39;t mean I know every piece of language and<br/>\nlore about it, nor do I care to.<br/>\n     But it would be nice if people would just spell out what it is they are<br/>\ntalking about, it would make me more interested in the messages that contain<br/>\nthese acronyms.<br/>\n<br/>\nTadian the flame receiver of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.

Using acronyms<br/>\n&gt; that aren&#39;t widely known is inconsiderate of those with whom you are<br/>\n&gt; supposedly trying to communicate.  Pointing people to an immense list of<br/>\n&gt; definitions is simply a way of saying you can&#39;t be bothered to type out<br/>\n&gt; words that would be relatively sufficient.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Overuse of acronyms was one of the problems that made IBM systems difficult<br/>\n&gt; and limited their use to the priesthood.  More considerate computer<br/>\n&gt; companies moved away from secret code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Acronyms are the rudest form of slang and jargon.  They are even worse than<br/>\n&gt; obscure words like &quot;proc&quot; because they aren&#39;t even pronouncable words.<br/>\n&gt; Acronyms are effectively a way to invent new words on the fly, then use<br/>\n&gt; them and berate the reader for not knowing what they mean.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll warn you now that I&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the computer<br/>\n&gt; industry for 30 years, with some success.  People either get the point and<br/>\n&gt; behave less rudely or miss the point and continue to speak in secret code,<br/>\n&gt; either not understanding or simply not caring whether they&#39;re communicating<br/>\n&gt; with the majority of their audience.  If you don&#39;t mind if the majority of<br/>\n&gt; the readers simply don&#39;t know what you meant and probably won&#39;t bother to<br/>\n&gt; find out, use them, but don&#39;t kid yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Bob<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
