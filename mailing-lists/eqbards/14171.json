I used Psalm<br/>\nof Cooling in LGuk with the mask before that patch and it did not cancel out<br/>\nthe mask&#39;s UV affect.  While its not a big deal it is a bug and we should<br/>\nprobably send it in.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to reiterate since I seem to be brainless today and the thread is<br/>\ngetting confusing, here is what you can do to reproduce the bug:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Right click you mask to cast illusion, note the blue tinge of UV.<br/>\n2. Begin to sing Psalm of Cooling, let it pulse at least once, then stop it.<br/>\n3. When the icon for Psalm fades, so will your UV.<br/>\n4. Recast the mask illusion and you get UV back.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Tatsukawa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jht@...\">jht@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 02, 2000 10:03 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Mask of Deception<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: John Tatsukawa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jht@...\">jht@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ah.
