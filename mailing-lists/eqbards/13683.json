And so do many of my friends and acquaintances.  Hehe obviously experience is<br/>\nneeded to get from 46 to 50.  For many classes 49 is the great level for spells. <br/>\nFor bards we have the 48 and 50 songs to get.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus some on this list argue that level is all in determining your effectiveness in<br/>\na raid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition many agree that a full level buffer is a good idea before attempting the<br/>\nplanes.  I would suggest that is even more the case after the recent patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Same thing for paw and mm is usually bad loot to. 46+ don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; care about exp it&#39;s just not needed. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not needed??<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Cyclops are camped all the time on E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; and allizweasuar is done when we need stuff. Again guards are just good for<br/>\n&gt; exp why do them when you don&#39;t need exp? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, ??<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kedge Keep and paw are just  two<br/>\n&gt; badly designed zones. As for guards they are boring and again we don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt; exp. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And again...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Besides the fact that they are camped 24/7 on e&#39;ci hell I wasn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; on prime time on my de necro went into oggok and guards were camped inside<br/>\n&gt; and out same with grobb guards. Freeport guards are always camped to inside<br/>\n&gt; and out. The only places that aren&#39;t camped usually are mm, Paw, and Kedge.<br/>\n&gt; Although paw and kedge are bad zones and the loot isn&#39;t very good. Again why<br/>\n&gt; would a 50 want exp? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because they truncated the 50 experience so every time you die in the planes or on<br/>\ndragon runs etc. you lose experience.  Unless and until you fall out of 50 into 49<br/>\nthis is likely not an issue.  But with enough deaths the loss of level will<br/>\neventually happen.  This means some loss in stats and of course for bards the loss<br/>\nof use of Verses of Victory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; MM is ok but the spawns are usually camped which makes<br/>\n&gt; it uselss. Hell I usually end up camping something in SOl A on my 50 necro<br/>\n&gt; so the overcrowding at high levles is definitly a issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good sir, I agree completely with your core point.  I found it to be unfortunately<br/>\nobscured in this message.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n//Maravana Vireo<br/>\n//48 Bard of Jus Divinum<br/>\n//Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
