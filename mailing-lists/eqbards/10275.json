I&#39;ve noticed there is a<br/>\nline of perception somewhere between hearing people say &quot;Nice weapon.<br/>\nWhere&#39;d you get that?&quot; and &quot;Hey, uber-twink, why do you need to group with<br/>\nus newbies? Vox is that way!&quot; I definitely prefer the former perception. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nA subquest for lambent could be entertaining. I do wish to feel I&#39;ve earned<br/>\nall the lambent armor I wear, and had envisioned beginning to group for the<br/>\nbracer items in a couple levels and the other items later in my 20&#39;s. (Nice<br/>\nto be in a bard-friendly guild now). I&#39;ve seen high teen bards with lotsa<br/>\ndough and connections that already have the lambent BP and other pieces, and<br/>\nit seemed too soon to me. I would at least insist on paying for the jewels.<br/>\n250pp would leave me absolutely broke. That, and a few laps around Norrath<br/>\ngetting items for a subquest would alleviate much of the &quot;twink&quot; guilt. :p<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re a fine HEF, Harmonic, nomatter what they say! =D<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman Overtone<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
