People need to quit pissing and moaning about these things, <br/>\nand decide if they REALLY like playing a bard. If not, go play a DE necro or <br/>\na dorf-kiting druid. Good riddance.

Where&#39;s the problem?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here&#39;s one of the messages that I posted in response to a bitchy message<br/>\n&gt;over in the Lullaby thread:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bards -<br/>\n&gt;I think it&#39;s important for us to focus on the one aspect of bards that <br/>\n&gt;seems<br/>\n&gt;to be *bugged*, not flame Verant because you feel that the Bard class is<br/>\n&gt;underpowered or unbalanced. Those are not the issues that we&#39;re attempting<br/>\n&gt;to discuss with this thread, and quite frankly issues that I feel are<br/>\n&gt;incorrect. I absolutely love being a bard. I feel that I&#39;m powerful enough<br/>\n&gt;and balanced quite well, thank you. However, I would love being a bard a <br/>\n&gt;bit<br/>\n&gt;more if Lullaby worked the way that GZ said on Veeshan that it should.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At the risk of multiple nerfs, let&#39;s recap some of our abilities:<br/>\n&gt;We cover ground much faster than any class in the game. Our spells last<br/>\n&gt;indefinitely and require no mana. We can cast while running. We have the<br/>\n&gt;versatility to strengthen our songs by equiping instruments instead of<br/>\n&gt;weapons. We can duel wield some of the finest weapons in the game. We can<br/>\n&gt;wear plate, and our armor quests have always worked and yielded quite nice<br/>\n&gt;(and nice looking) armor. We can tank a bit. We can do some single-mob<br/>\n&gt;mezzing with Pixie Strike. We get party-wide Clarity that costs no mana to<br/>\n&gt;cast. We can heal up to 19 HPs a tick (manaless) for all party members and<br/>\n&gt;at lvl 47+ we can now heal for up to ~35 HPs/tick *for the entire party<br/>\n&gt;simultaneously and without mana*. We are the only class versatile enough to<br/>\n&gt;change party buffs *during battle* as the battle flow changes (caster shows<br/>\n&gt;up, change to MR songs). We can put up party-wide damage shields that are<br/>\n&gt;also resist enhancers. We get *the best* resist buffs in the game against<br/>\n&gt;fire, cold and magic making bards irreplacable for dragon raids. We can<br/>\n&gt;track, hide, sneak and forage. And more...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ladies and gentleman. We rock. Period.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you don&#39;t enjoy playing a bard then by all means start playing another<br/>\n&gt;class. The Bard class is NOT broken. A song&#39;s behavior is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Crier Sharpsong<br/>\n&gt;47th Bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
