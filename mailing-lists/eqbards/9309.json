Like I said, I got lazy and rarely<br/>\nused it in my 20s and 30s (grouping with an enchanter will do<br/>\nthat :).  But at level 40 I&#39;ve used it pretty extensively the<br/>\nlast few days.  I&#39;ve yet to have it fail, and it&#39;s only been<br/>\nresisted once (mob did not attack though).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I did use it for a bit around L30 when I was pulling in<br/>\nCazic.  I distinctly recall it failing several times there,<br/>\nbut for the most part it worked.  Most of the failures were<br/>\nstraight resists causing unlamented mobs to come along.  There<br/>\nwere only 2 or 3 times where a lamented mob joined in.  My chr<br/>\nis unusually high though, 120 back then, 140 now.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
