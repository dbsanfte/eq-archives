As a lowly wood elf who is somewhat<br/>\nweak, I&#39;m finding it more and more difficult to cope with all the<br/>\narmour and weapons I carry, and still be able to pick up some loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy str is somewhere around 80 (memory failure!).  And before I even<br/>\nset out to hunt I&#39;m carrying all but 10 of it.  Now ok, I&#39;m kitted out<br/>\nin some fairly decent armour, mostly banded and ringmail, and a piece<br/>\nof bronze, so I&#39;m well protected.  But it&#39;s rather heavy!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, are there any suggestions about the type of armour I can<br/>\nget that will be lighter?  Looking for cheap alternatives, or<br/>\nsomewhere to go murder things and steal their armour.  I can even go<br/>\nout and deal with (most) wisps as a steady source of income if cheap<br/>\nisn&#39;t possible ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nSaldara<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (20), Mith Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\nMelaniel<br/>\nWood Elf Bard (11), Mith Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
