I can do max 28 points if both<br/>\nweapons hit.  The Sk can do 44 with one hit at max.  His delay is twice<br/>\nmine, but I don&#39;t dual wield every round and he double attacks about 80% as<br/>\noften as I dual wield.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nI will parse the numbers if I can get them back together.  Will have to find<br/>\nanother SK though he is 3 levels higher than me now which would skew it too<br/>\nmuch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Danny Craigg [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danny@...\">danny@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 2:57 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bards abilities redefined was: Attack speedups <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;However, if I<br/>\n&gt;was within 20% of the other people&#39;s damage output over the course of 50<br/>\n&gt;fights, statistics would tell you that during some of those fights I would<br/>\n&gt;actually do more damage than them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re attributing the occasional ability to outdamage someone<br/>\nwith a higher percentage on the randomness of the RNG.  Is that correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In no fight did I<br/>\n&gt;outdamage them for more than a few mob swings.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This seems to support your reasoning above, if I understood it correctly.<br/>\nIt sounds like there were occassions where you outdamaged them, despite<br/>\ntheir higher melee ability.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In many fights I never outdamaged them and took not one attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And this makes sense, since samples over time negate the random factor.  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re only 80% as effective, over time, you expect the mob to stay on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
