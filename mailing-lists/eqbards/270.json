My whole purpose<br/>\nfor creating the organization was to do exactly what several of you have<br/>\nrecently suggested on this list--that is, to reestablish the role of the<br/>\nancient bard. We record and report the history of Norrath, as best as we<br/>\ncan, from a neutral standpoint. We also, as bards, try to answer all<br/>\nrequests for information and news, and try to do so as truthfully and<br/>\ninformatively as we can. We&#39;re providing escorts, and heraldry services,<br/>\nand sometimes, yes, we do charge a fee for these, usually negotiable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as being cliquish, we are a guild. We do have standards for our<br/>\nmembers, and requirements that must be accomplished as a student before you<br/>\ncan wear the title of Soerbaird. We are not interested in being one of<br/>\nthose 1000 guilds who allow anyone in, and are just to &#39;have fun&#39;. We do<br/>\nhang out together, as we certainly enjoy the company of other bards, but we<br/>\nalso spend much time traveling individually to meet others. We have a goal,<br/>\nwe work hard toward it, and I am proud to say that we are accomplishing<br/>\nthat goal on a daily basis. Stop by our library in Iona hall (on our site)<br/>\nand read or submit ballads or stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said, if you have ANY problems with a Soerbaird&#39;s behavior, either<br/>\nin Norrath or on a forum, I invite you to send a mail directly to me,<br/>\nJythri,  with as many details as you can include. I take matters of<br/>\nmisconduct VERY seriously, and have already placed a couple of our bards on<br/>\nprobation because of things they&#39;ve done.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy contact address is:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rvarnell@...\">rvarnell@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe bardic profession is a noble and often thankless one, and I hope that<br/>\nall bards in or apart from the Soerbaird may ascend to the higher calling.<br/>\nLet us work together to enliven the culture of Norrath!<br/>\n<br/>\nListen and Live!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Jythri, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
