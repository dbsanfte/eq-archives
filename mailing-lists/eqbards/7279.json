In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1413088685\">Heh heh, good points.  I think the overall point was, and still is, that our<br/>\ndefensive melee skill do not allow us to be effective at what we need to do.<br/>\nIn fact we are no more effective at tanking than clerics.  Doesn&#39;t our Dodge<br/>\ncap at 100?  Clerics caps at 80 as I recall so it isn&#39;t even a 45 pt<br/>\ndifference then.  We really should have some other defense skills since the<br/>\nraces that are bards cannot have the hitpoint and strength values that the<br/>\nclerics and shamans have as a matter of course.  Our agility is also only<br/>\nslightly better than the dwarves and barbarians, though we do outshine the<br/>\nogres and trolls.  Since higher agility has lesser rewards, having a 100<br/>\nagility while someone else has an 85 isn&#39;t as much a difference as 100 str<br/>\nvs 85 str.  Too bad I didn;t know that 17+ levels ago, no turning back now.<br/>\nI wanted to be a I don&#39;t get hit much, but when I do it hurts, type of bard,<br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t seem to be possible with the reduced bonuses for high<br/>\nagility.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst monsters we fare no better than clerics.  I am probably in the only<br/>\ngroup where the cleric tanks and I play songs.  we tried it the other way<br/>\nround but he was always oom from healing me to keep me alive.  This way he<br/>\ngets beat up a bit but my healing song with lute keeps him from having to<br/>\nuse all his mana on healing eery fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 28, 1999 10:28 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bards vs Clerics in melee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 28 Sep 1999, Ryan Honeyman wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With similar AC, hp, defense, dodge... and much much better melee<br/>\n&gt; skills and dual wield, I don&#39;t understand why this conversation <br/>\n&gt; continues =)   In fact it&#39;s becoming pointless.
