I just couldn&#39;t remember the exact equation I had come up<br/>\nwith, figured John had messed around with it anyhow and had a better memory<br/>\nthan me, and our EQ team here at work was arguing over it.  I checked my<br/>\nequation when I got home and it was a bit different than John&#39;s, but only<br/>\nbecause I used average damage per hit and hit% while he used average damage<br/>\nper round and hits per round.  Worked out the same after converting.  Still,<br/>\nit proved my point to the guys at work that against very fast mobs if we<br/>\nused Psalm we could ignore the fact that they got spread over 3 tanks and we<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t need to chain-chain-chain on 3 mobs, it would be far better to just<br/>\nPsalm them.  Now if I could make 23 so we could have 2 chainers, that would<br/>\nbe even better.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, November 19, 1999 7:46 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Psalm of Warmth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 19 Nov 1999, Eric Boller wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, what this doesnt&#39; take into account is<br/>\n&gt; the fact that chain gets resisted what seems like at<br/>\n&gt; least 25% or more fighting white critters.
