I saw Babbinsbort<br/>\ntwice in one evening and we killed him both times.  I have seen Zahal at<br/>\nleast a half dozen times, twice when I had to flee in abject terror while I<br/>\nwas pulling Griffawns.  I have only seen Bilge twice, but both times<br/>\ntogether he lived a total of about 30 seconds.  Haven&#39;t done the OOT stuff,<br/>\nbut our guild Cleric has killed Gull three times.  Why did they think Babbs<br/>\nonly spawns every 7.5 hours?  Unless something is different from server to<br/>\nserver he spawned on ours twice in a 4-5 hour period.  Maybe 3 times<br/>\nincluding the placeholder Mob, can&#39;t remember for sure if we killed<br/>\nsomething else in that spot but we definitely nailed him twice in that<br/>\nperiod.  I don&#39;t get to play all that much being only 21st level despite<br/>\nplaying since first week of April so either I&#39;m very lucky with stupid<br/>\ncleric mobs or it differs from server to server for some reason.  Maybe<br/>\nthose spawns are triggered somehow and we just happened to do the unknown<br/>\ntriggering action more often.<br/>\nOn the other hand while I can defeat those cleric needed mobs I have seen, I<br/>\ncannot come close to beating a Hill giant or Griff.  In the 10 levels or so<br/>\nbetween now and the time I can beat those HG&#39;s and Griffs I imagine I could<br/>\nsee all the cleric mobs many times if I chose to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n\tMaybe I shoulda been a cleric, Nah I like travelling too much<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Andrew Simpson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hornsfan@...\">hornsfan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 30, 1999 9:19 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] RE: Cleric/Bard armor quests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Andrew Simpson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hornsfan@...\">hornsfan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Clerics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;all it requires is time.

A cleric friend of <br/>\nmine made sure that he was at that spawn point every 7.5 hours for 2 weeks <br/>\nbefore he finally spawned.

He&#39;s not even going to try to get the <br/>\nbreastplate, the one piece he can&#39;t get because Bilge won&#39;t spawn, and he&#39;s <br/>\ngiven up on the bracers because that stupid ghoul in NK won&#39;t spawn either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 43 Bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
