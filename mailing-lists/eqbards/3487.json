Heck,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-710351685\">I am curious then, what is the rationale behind allowing casters to bind<br/>\nright outside of a dungeon.  My beef has never been that only casters can<br/>\nbind.  Heck, I party up 100% of the time, and always with someone who can<br/>\nbind.  I have no problem with this.  But what ungodly reason made you guys<br/>\ndecide to make 2/3rds of the classes have to run for long periods of time,<br/>\nsometimes VERY long periods of time to get back to the dungeon they were<br/>\nin, while the binding classes are back in a matter of minutes.  One of the<br/>\nmost discouraging problems in EQ is DOWNTIME.  I would rather die several<br/>\ntimes in a row trying to get my corpse than have to run for 30 minutes<br/>\nbefore even getting to TRY.  Now granted, the one nice benefit of this is<br/>\nthat it makes adventuring in far away dungeons more difficult, and<br/>\ntherefore less people populate these dungeons than otherwise would, but it<br/>\nis still unbalancing to the game.  I&#39;m with the folks that say NO ONE<br/>\nshould be able to bind outside cities.  Nothing more frustrating than<br/>\ngetting killed in Paw, and have to run all the way back from Highhold,<br/>\nwhile your cleric and wizard buddies are back in the dungeon, with all<br/>\ntheir stuff, making experience and cash while you&#39;re just running naked,<br/>\ntrying not to get killed by Griffons and Hill Giants.  This isn&#39;t even<br/>\nbringing up the bard specific problem that it takes forever to remem all<br/>\nyour songs since we don&#39;t have meditate.  So the casters get a huge bonus<br/>\nthere as well.  They die, and 30 seconds later they&#39;re back up and ready to<br/>\ngo, with basically no loss in offensive power, but some loss in defense.  I<br/>\nhate to suggest gimping another class, but in this case, I see it as the<br/>\nonly way to address a serious game inbalance.  The ONLY thing that keeps me<br/>\nplaying a bard at all is that I do get accelerando.  I would never play a<br/>\nnon-caster, non-bard though, due to the incredible frustration of running<br/>\nback to your corpse.  Some would say, &quot;Just don&#39;t die.&quot;  To which I say,<br/>\n&quot;If I&#39;m not dying, I&#39;m not taking enough risks for the game to be fun.&quot;<br/>\nThe running back part is far from fun however.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, rambling.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:16 PM 7/13/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;J.M.
