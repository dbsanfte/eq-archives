At these levels, Tanks are your friends. They can dish out the<br/>\ndamage and you can heal them and restore stamina like crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best XP experiences from 15th-30th were all with a group of several<br/>\ntanks and ME (no caster, no pure healer). Just make sure the tanks<br/>\nspread the damage around and your hymn is better than even a cleric.<br/>\nOnce you start to fight mobs that can whack a tank down to nothing fast<br/>\n(read casting mobs, froggies, giants, etc.) a healer is a MUST, but just<br/>\nfighting crocs in oasis or dervs being pulled well, your hymn is<br/>\nawesome, and you can get by with just a ranger or paladin for heals.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, I went from 27-30 in 3 days when the DW pets were running rampant<br/>\nin Lake Rathe. a group of 3-4 tanks, with me singing hymn, Psalm of<br/>\nCooling and occasional Jig. Every time we added a caster, we killed<br/>\nthings SLOWER than without him.<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n35th Bard, Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I play a HE 13 level bard, but I am only a part-time player (maybe a couple<br/>\n&gt; hours a week).  Lvl 12 took forever and 13 seems to be taking longer...<br/>\n&gt; Will leveling get easier as I get more levels or does it take longer for<br/>\n&gt; each new level?  I know that the XP gap gets bigger each level, but<br/>\n&gt; hopefully the better equipment that comes later and a better selection of<br/>\n&gt; mobs make it easier? To make things short, is the easier or harder to level<br/>\n&gt; in the early teens compared to later levels..  <br/>\n&gt; Also, is it impossible to reach high levels without camping?  I hate<br/>\n&gt; camping and will not camp for more than 1/2 an hour before I get bored and<br/>\n&gt; leave....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Reed<br/>\n&gt; 13 lvl  Bard of S Ro..<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
