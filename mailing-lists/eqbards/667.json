I was wondering if anyone knew about our skill caps?<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically, Hand to Hand - for a while now, mine has stopped at 3 * level<br/>\n+ 1.  Does anyone know if this is the limit for us in this skill?  I&#39;ve<br/>\nasked several of our bardic kin in-game, and no one seems to know the<br/>\nanswer for sure (I got a lot of people curious though  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and one more thing - does anyone know if there are any specific<br/>\ndifferences in using the various instruments avaliable in the game?  (for<br/>\nexample - the mandolin and the lute - is it just the weight that&#39;s<br/>\ndifferent?  or a brass horn and a mino horn?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDantos, bard of The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
