We&#39;d apologize once again for taking the servers down, but what<br/>\nwould be the point? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe following changes were made: <br/>\n<br/>\n1.) Wizards - We&#39;ve finally given Wizards a few quick &quot;Insta-Death&quot; spells.<br/>\nOur hope is that this will make all the wizards shut up for a little while,<br/>\nuntil they start to complain about lack of plate armor for their class. <br/>\n<br/>\n2.) Druids - Because of the over-abundance of Druids in Norrath, the next<br/>\ntime you login one out of every three Druids will be randomly reassigned a<br/>\nnew class. <br/>\n<br/>\n3.) Warriors and Monks - These melee classes have been given magical<br/>\nabilities at last. They now can bind, gate, heal and summon food. <br/>\n<br/>\n4.) Magicians and Enchanters - New pet spell added: Nagafen. We&#39;ve given<br/>\nthese two classes a fine new pet to help them in their everyday struggles in<br/>\nNorrath. <br/>\n<br/>\n5.) Rogues - We feel this class is our crowning achievement. We believe it<br/>\nhas been perfectly balanced, and as such will not receive any modifications<br/>\nfor the rest of EverQuest&#39;s life. <br/>\n<br/>\n6.) Hybrids (Rangers, Paladins, Shadow Knights) - After careful data<br/>\nanalysis we&#39;ve come to the conclusion that simply giving these classes a few<br/>\nof their spellcaster counterparts spells is not enough. So thus we&#39;ve given<br/>\nthem all the spells they would normally receive had they been a Druid,<br/>\nCleric or Necromancer. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to these changes, the Necromancer and Cleric classes will be<br/>\noverhauled in the near future! Unfortunately if you already have a character<br/>\nthat is one of these two classes you will loose all your items and be<br/>\nrandomly renamed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your patience! <br/>\n<br/>\n-The EverQuest Team</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
