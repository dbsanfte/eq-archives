I decided that it would be nice to look at<br/>\nthe desert so I went in the Northern Ro and killed a couple of orc riders.<br/>\nThey were all blue to me. Then I met a tarantula, yellow to me, and I<br/>\nattacked her, I just wanted to see if I could win. I started twisting<br/>\nJonthans&#39;s whistling war song with Hymn of Restoration and sometimes I added<br/>\nChords of Dissonance. I can&#39;t twist more than two songs because of the lag.<br/>\nOn the end I managed to kill the tarantula with 11 hp left and then when I<br/>\nfinally relaxed KABOOM :) an orc rider attacked me. I was hit for 16 damage<br/>\nwith his first blow and knocked down unconscious. I was still singing the<br/>\nHymn when he knocked me down so my health was rising slowly. Then I regained<br/>\nconsciences and  KABOOM  I was on the ground again. At that time I thought I<br/>\nwas dead and I just waited for a message LOADING....<br/>\n    I waited and waited and waited.... I waited for 6 minutes and 34<br/>\nseconds. Then I regained conscious again and I pressed my Call for help<br/>\nbutton. No one was around and I was on the floor again. I waited for 4 or 5<br/>\nmore minutes while the orc was hitting me and then finally I regained<br/>\nconsciences and he missed. So there was I with 3 hp left and I gave him a<br/>\nblow for 4 damage and then he gave me a blow for 10 damage and then here we<br/>\ngo again.... me on the ground.... me standing KABOOM.... me on the<br/>\nground.... and so on and on and on.... I was hitting him point by point<br/>\nuntil I have won the battle, with 3 or 4 hp. The whole thing lasted for 23<br/>\nminutes and I don&#39;t have to say that the only thing that kept me alive was<br/>\nmy song. After the battle I have equipped my drum, played Selo&#39;s and<br/>\nreturned to Freeport without a nerve left in my body.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you liked the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsandir<br/>\nA bard with 9 songs</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
