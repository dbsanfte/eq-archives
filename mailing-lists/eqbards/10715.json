I see level 10&#39;s not twinked<br/>\n&gt; walking around in bronze armor. I remember when it was rare to see a level<br/>\n&gt; 20 in bronze. You guys don&#39;t have anything to upgrade is becausey ou have<br/>\n&gt; good stuff a bit earlier then you were ment to. There is nothing you can do<br/>\n&gt; about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope, there isn&#39;t. Starting on a new server can help a bit, but even on<br/>\nthe newer servers things become available way faster than when the game<br/>\nstarted in March. I started a new char on The Tribunal and someone was<br/>\nselling banded 4 days after the server opened!!! And there&#39;s a lot of<br/>\npeople who know all the tricks for levelling quickly now, so bronze and<br/>\n20-30 level weapons hit the market way sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
