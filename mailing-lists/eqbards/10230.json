The group doesn&#39;t have a<br/>\nrogue, the bard can try to pick the lock (not that this ever happens).  No<br/>\nRanger or Druid, then the bard can track.  The group is caster heavy then<br/>\nthe bard can tank.  The group is melee heavy, the bard can be the<br/>\nbuffer/healer.  Then add in the utility songs, Selos, corpse locate, water<br/>\nbreathing and such.  It&#39;s all of this that make the bard a<br/>\nJack-of-all-trades.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On the other hand we have our spell abilities.  These are definitely<br/>\n&gt; designed with bards as the ultimate party animals in mind.  Our magical<br/>\n&gt; abilities magnify immensely with each member we add to our group, and are<br/>\n&gt; underpowered at best if we are alone with some notable exceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  Bards songs do very well in a group environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s just me, but I don&#39;t equate Jack-of-all-trade as<br/>\nself-sufficiency.  I view it more as an ability to fill different roles<br/>\ndepending on the makeup of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
