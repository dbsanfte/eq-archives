I also experimented with Pixie Strike last night<br/>\n  in the Arena on myself after I died.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I couldn&#39;t find any pattern to when the song would and would not work,<br/>\n  but most of the time this is what happened (based on the messages<br/>\n  I recall, forget the exact wording).<br/>\n<br/>\n  You begin to send forth music. (0 sec)  (-13 MR)<br/>\n  You are stunned.               (0 sec)<br/>\n  Your song ends.                (0 sec)<br/>\n  Your song ends.                (0 sec)<br/>\n  You are unstunned.             (6 sec)<br/>\n  You are no longer stunned.     (8 sec)<br/>\n<br/>\n  And again:<br/>\n<br/>\n  You begin to send forth music. (0 sec)  (-13 MR)<br/>\n  You are no longer stunned.     (8 sec)<br/>\n  <br/>\n  And again:<br/>\n  <br/>\n  You being to send forth music  (0 sec)  (-13 MR)<br/>\n  You are no longer stunned.     (8 sec)<br/>\n<br/>\n  This time I let the icon fade away first:<br/>\n<br/>\n  You being to send forth music  (0 sec)  (-13 MR)<br/>\n  You are no longer stunned.     (8 sec)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then I let it fade again:<br/>\n<br/>\n  You begin to send forth music. (0 sec)  (-13 MR)<br/>\n  You are stunned.               (0 sec)<br/>\n  Your song ends.                (0 sec)<br/>\n  Your song ends.                (0 sec)<br/>\n  You are unstunned.             (6 sec)<br/>\n  You are no longer stunned.     (8 sec)<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s really weird.  I cannot explain the circumstances when I <br/>\n  actually take the song hit, but dont take the stun with it.<br/>\n  The song does always drop MR when not resisted, it just doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  always send the stun component in.  Also I wish Verant would<br/>\n  change the song fade message to:  You stop sending forth music<br/>\n  instead of You are no longer stunned.  Because it&#39;s simply not<br/>\n  the case.  It&#39;s purely text message, and does not indicate anything<br/>\n  other than the fact that the song effects are done.  You can break<br/>\n  the stun earlier than the full duration and often do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Since Pixie and Lullaby are so closely tied together in their<br/>\n  effective impact (stuns a creature) - I am willing to bet there<br/>\n  was an indirect change a month or so ago which is propagating <br/>\n  false signals to the objects stun code.  (As it stands now, <br/>\n  both in PvP, against oneself, and against NPCs the effect is<br/>\n  universal - song skill check rolls success, yet the stun is<br/>\n  not accepted by the object)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Since Verant was looking for LPmud coders, I&#39;m guessing that<br/>\n  a lot of their structure is built up upon that model.  I coded<br/>\n  on an LPmud for 2 years, both object and area design.  And even<br/>\n  some of the base models, like player and monster.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  This may be just a wild guessing (read: warning techie lingo coming)<br/>\n<br/>\n  But when you target someone for Pixie Strike.  I would imagine you<br/>\n  are picking up the object (player or npc) at that time.  When you<br/>\n  begin to sing the song, the server does its basic checking.  Are <br/>\n  you in range of the target coords?  If so, is this a valid target?<br/>\n  And did the target save vs. your song?  At that point, I&#39;m guessing<br/>\n  several things can happen, but most likely:<br/>\n<br/>\n  The server sends you info back saying:  Target didnt resist.  To<br/>\n  which your client finds the appropriate message to display from<br/>\n  your spell data file.  And then the server processes the target<br/>\n  in order to make the effect happen.  In our case, our target <br/>\n  must have some variable in the object class for being <br/>\n  stunned.  And the attack and movement methods in the object<br/>\n  are setup such that [ if (stunned) return; ]  Basically, if <br/>\n  I (the object) am stunned, then don&#39;t perform this action.<br/>\n  Then internally the object has a timer on the stun, which<br/>\n  it counts down periodically.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you try this on yourself, clearly the server is not correctly<br/>\n  giving you the stun &#39;command&#39; whatever it may be.  I first thought, <br/>\n  maybe the server is in fact telling the object it is stunned<br/>\n  but expiring it so quickly that nothing happens.  But wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n  you see:  You are stunned.  You are unstunned.  at the same <br/>\n  time?  I would think so.  Or maybe telling an object to stun<br/>\n  for 0 seconds is just skipped since a 0 second stun is obsolete.<br/>\n  That could be, then no messages would display.  But that&#39;s if<br/>\n  the coded it in said way.<br/>\n<br/>\n  target-&gt;stun(0);   // send target stun for 0 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  private int stunned;<br/>\n<br/>\n  void function stun(int duration)<br/>\n  {<br/>\n     if (stunned)   return;  // already stunned, skip.<br/>\n     if (!duration) return;  // no duration?, skip.<br/>\n<br/>\n     stunned = duration;<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\n  Errr, damn hehe... I&#39;ve got _real_ work to do =)<br/>\n  Sorry for the massive brain dump.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
