I understand that the claim is<br/>\n&gt; that it doesn&#39;t work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (extracted from: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=2228)\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=2228)</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; original thread on everwhine:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006818.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006818.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sounds to me like they ain&#39;t gonna fix the Chains nerf...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; MacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 24th Song Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Solusek Ro Wanderers </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
