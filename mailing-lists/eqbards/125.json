Let your imagination a<br/>\nbit loose and consider that perhaps someday Verant will let us feed in a<br/>\nMIDI or .wav file that then goes to the listeners.  The bandwidth needed<br/>\nfor a MIDI might even be within reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I further assume that you simply supply the words for all those nearby<br/>\nto read.  Is there a way to do that in reasonable quantity without having<br/>\nto type them as you go?  Do you perhaps set up chunks of the words as<br/>\ncommand macros, then touch those off one at a time in order?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob/Thrush of Freeport on Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
