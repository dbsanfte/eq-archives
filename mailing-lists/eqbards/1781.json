He proposed<br/>\nthat a character&#39;s ability to wear types of armor be based on their defense<br/>\nskill.  This way you could put a defense rating requirement on each type of<br/>\narmor.  The rationale being that it takes a certain amount of martial training<br/>\nin order to fight effectively in various types of armor.  Just to throw some<br/>\nnumbers out as examples, lets say:<br/>\n<br/>\nDefense Skill  0 is sufficient for cloth, 20 for patchwork and leather, 50 for<br/>\nBanded and Chain, 100 for Plate.  (Magical Equivalents like netted, woven,<br/>\nrubicite would require further consideration, and this is BY NO MEANS anything<br/>\nmore than an illustration, no change is being suggested here).<br/>\n<br/>\nYet another way to approach this is to make each armor type a skill which would<br/>\nmodify how well a certain armor worked for a character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think both are good ideas, but the current system is good enough.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
