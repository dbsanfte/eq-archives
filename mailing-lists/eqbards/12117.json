Since I don&#39;t want to have anything to do<br/>\n&gt; with the corrupt guards anyhow, that&#39;s a plus in my book.  Also killing<br/>\n&gt; Trumpy raises your faction with merchants, not lowers it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, are you sure on that last bit?  I used to be amiable with<br/>\nthe merchants there.  Then I camped in Cazic and got hit by<br/>\nthat bug that reset some of my factions and I was back to<br/>\ndubious with them, but they&#39;d still sell to me.  I was grouped<br/>\nwith a friend who was KOS to Trumpy, and we ran into this bug.  <br/>\nTrumpy and a friend came charging up the dock and my friends<br/>\ncasually killed them both.  Since I was playing Clarity at the<br/>\ntime, I took the faction hits.  The merchants wouldn&#39;t sell to<br/>\nme after that.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
