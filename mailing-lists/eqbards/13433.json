I have eight ability-only skills now which<br/>\nrequire buttons to use them.  I think I can only set up six at once?<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Anyone know the max on Hide and/or Sneak?<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  What does it mean to have a lower/higher Hide skill level?  It<br/>\n*appears* to work perfectly each time.  I hit the button, I disappear.<br/>\nDoes skill level determine the length of time that it works?  Or whether<br/>\nthe MOBs can see you anyway?  Or anything else at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  Is there any way to know whether Sneak actually worked or not?<br/>\nOther than trying to move and estimating based on your walking speed?<br/>\nWhat does Sneak do?  Is it just a mobile Hide?  Why do we have Hide<br/>\nthen, when you could Sneak and stand still?<br/>\n<br/>\n5)  Are they getting rid of Instill Doubt?  Has anyone ever trained a<br/>\npoint in this skill?<br/>\n<br/>\n6)  Begging 77 now, never got more than a copper (well, I seem to recall<br/>\nhaving received a silver piece once, but I may be deluded), although I<br/>\nnow get a copper more than half the time, it seems.  Anyone with a<br/>\nhigher skill who managed to get more?  In terms of cash received, are<br/>\nthere &quot;good&quot; begging targets and &quot;bad&quot; begging targets (other than pets<br/>\nand ships)?<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 40 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
