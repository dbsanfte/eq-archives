Verant had implemented<br/>\nthis for Halloween, but the response from all the players over lvl 30 was so<br/>\npositive they decided to let it stay. So during the day it&#39;s clear, and at<br/>\nnight it is hell on Norrath. Awesome fun though =)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and there is plenty to be scared of in Norrath, generally though we dont<br/>\nhave to be too worried just travelling around. It&#39;s good to be the bard =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHaven&#39;t run into Grimfeather or Shadowed men yet. But even if they could<br/>\noutrun a lower lvl bard, I doubt they could outrun a bard past lvl 40. Bard<br/>\nspeed is just sick at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nDank McGillicuty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm, my run thru Kith was in day time hours.
