For the past 10+<br/>\nlevels, I am concerned with keeping my clerics and casters in AE for mana<br/>\nsong and spend time in outside views watching for the sparkles.  It might be<br/>\nworth while to get a friend - ungrouped and test the actual AE radius for<br/>\nyour dmg songs.  One might find that you can use them with the dreaded<br/>\nenchanters - as long as you can not wake up the sleeping mobs.  And maybe<br/>\nbards can do this once you understand the AE radius well.  Also, this<br/>\npresumes that we want to do this (ie your songs will do more dmg that your<br/>\nweps.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 06, 2000 3:12 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Instrument vs. melee attacks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll be trying out weapon vs no weapon tonite for those at 23rd or below.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll let you know how the comparison is at that point so we can begin a<br/>\n&gt; curve to see what works where.
