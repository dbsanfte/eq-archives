Sometimes, I would <br/>\nhave to switch to constantly refreshing the song to keep it sticking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did NOT notice this shortened duration for Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding, <br/>\nthough.  Perhaps something was changed in the patch effecting the <br/>\nmovement portion of the song, and of course if the snare effect<br/>\nbreaks <br/>\nthe slowdown effect wears off as well.  Largo&#39;s, being a slowdown and <br/>\nAC debuff, seems unaffected by the change.  I wonder, were Snare and <br/>\nthe Darkness series affected by this also?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real question I have is this.  I thought that CHA only affected <br/>\nthe resist rates on mind influencing songs, the ones with the head <br/>\nicon, like Solon&#39;s, Lament, etc.  Some recent posts seem to suggest <br/>\notherwise.  Has this been tested at all?  I know that CHA is also<br/>\ntied <br/>\nin to missing notes, but does it effect the duration of songs like<br/>\nthe <br/>\nChants and Chain as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nPistov Kazidaizahlot<br/>\nBard of 42 Songs<br/>\nCazic - Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
