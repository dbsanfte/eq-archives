That was quick.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I understand your philosophical concerns, but isn&#39;t it the case <br/>\nthat:  1) an unscrupulous company could scan our disks anyway and most of <br/>\nus would have no clue, 2) their proposed EULA did NOT give them <br/>\npermission to look at anything that wasn&#39;t EQ-related, and 3) they&#39;re <br/>\nmuch too sloppy and overburdened to go through the hassle which would <br/>\nbe required to actually make use of any other information?
