I also used <br/>\n&gt; it at Lower Guk a few days ago (Friday night I think) against Zol and Dar <br/>\n&gt; ghoul frogloks, it works well.  I can hold them for like minutes so our <br/>\n&gt; group could break up the camp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, I think they Up&#39;ed the mob resist rate.  Not the resist messages, <br/>\n&gt; but the way that they break the trance even when the song went thru.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is what I thought at first - that the mobs were instantly<br/>\nbreaking out of the song effect.  However, if you carefully<br/>\nobserve how many Strikes it takes to successfully mesmerize a<br/>\nmob, compared to how many Strikes it takes to keep it<br/>\nmesmerized, it&#39;s obvious that this isn&#39;t what&#39;s going on.  If<br/>\nit were a tweak with the rate they broke out of the effect,<br/>\nthey should be &quot;immediately breaking out&quot; as often with<br/>\nsubsequent Strikes as with the initial ones.  That isn&#39;t the<br/>\ncase.  Once you successfully get Strike to stick, it&#39;s almost<br/>\ntrivial to keep it mesmerized - basically if it isn&#39;t<br/>\nresisted, the Strike gets &quot;refreshed,&quot; usually for another<br/>\nthree pulses.  Aside from resists, it virtually never fails in<br/>\nthis manner if you&#39;re Striking a mesmerized mob.  The bug only<br/>\nseems to happen if you&#39;re trying to Strike a non-mesmerized<br/>\nmob.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you give me a situation where three mobs my level start off<br/>\nmesmerized, I can pretty much hold all three of them with this<br/>\nsong indefinitely by Striking them one after another.  But if<br/>\nyou give me three unmesmerized mobs, I&#39;ll probably have to<br/>\nStrike the first one 5-7 times before one finally &quot;sticks.&quot;<br/>\nOnly then can I move on to trying to get one to stick to the<br/>\nsecond, which means another 5-7 tries while keeping the first<br/>\none refreshed.  By this time my cleric is dead from having the<br/>\n2 other mobs beating on him while I futzed around with the<br/>\nfirst one.  That is what makes this song broken and virtually<br/>\nuseless.  Given the high &quot;false failure&quot; rate, I found it more<br/>\neffective to just charm the thing and remove its damage from<br/>\nthe fight on the first try.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I am at lv50 so maybe at lower level this will be worst.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try it on yourself.
