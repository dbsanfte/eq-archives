I would much rather not die so easily rather than<br/>\njust waste less time after an inevitable death.  With the current taunting<br/>\nrules I have given up totally on pickup groups.  All it takes is one screwup<br/>\nby anyone in a pickup group and most of the casters, who have little loyalty<br/>\nto their groupmates, gate out.  The melee guys aren&#39;t being targeted anyhow<br/>\nso usually make it out.  As the main focus of mob anger I however end up<br/>\nbuying the farm.  Nothing like having group leader scream &quot;Bad Pull,<br/>\neveryone zone!&quot;, only to see 3 casters gate out and 2 melee types including<br/>\nthe puller run for the zone while the horde of critters bears down on you.<br/>\nNote to the wise, Lullaby will not save you from a train of 12 familiars in<br/>\nMistmoore at level 21.  Neither will Accelerando.  Not to mention the<br/>\nDeathly Ancilles train that got me later when the casters gated out right in<br/>\nfront of me with nary a word.  Needless to say I need a bigger ignore list<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 20, 2000 12:54 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Are we Hybrids?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAye, that&#39;s exactly what I wanted when I started this thread.  I&#39;d much<br/>\nrather<br/>\nbe a real  Hybrid with additional _defensive_ skills, rather than given<br/>\nbind.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;ll take either.  The end of the original post says that we get the<br/>\ndownside of both types.  Fixing either is fine with me :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias, Sol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n============================================<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni think he is using a bind argument in order to really say we could use just<br/>\n1 more defensive skill, such as parry.  i agree that we should get parry and<br/>\nhave it capped around the same as our dodge (125?).  it would just put us<br/>\none very small notch towards a melee class, which i do think we are far more<br/>\nthan a cleric or shaman.  i&#39;ve always thought we should not get bind, and<br/>\nall the reasons for and against have already been gone over a million times.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, L37 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!  <br/>\n  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
