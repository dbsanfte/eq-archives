I hit level 27 yesterday and decided to<br/>\n&gt; practice on Griffeenes to get my charm.  I noticed a couple of things during<br/>\n&gt; my 8 successful and 3 unsuccessful attempts, 1 ending in with my death.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1)  Once, the Griffeene just flat out disappeared when my pet killed it.<br/>\n&gt; The only thing I did differently in this case was using one griffeene<br/>\n&gt; against another.  They are so hard to find, so I couldn&#39;t pass up that<br/>\n&gt; opportunity.  Anyone know what might have caused this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It has never happened to me but what could have happened was at the time<br/>\nthe Griffenne that was your pet started it&#39;s killing blow it became<br/>\nuncharmed.  Hence you lose the kill because your former pet was the<br/>\ncreature that dealt the most damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2)  If I didn&#39;t immediately give the griffawn the attack command on the<br/>\n&gt; griffeene, it tended to attack lions and grizzlies indescrimately.  My only<br/>\n&gt; death using sirens was from a mini-train of grizzlies and highland lions.  I<br/>\n&gt; should have aborted my attempt and zoned, but I didn&#39;t want to loose the<br/>\n&gt; Griffeene (I almost had it!).  If I immediately ran up to the fawn and gave<br/>\n&gt; it an attack order on the feene the first time I charmed it, then I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; need to give any orders for the rest of the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is the result of anything that would attack a player at the same<br/>\nlevel as the Griffawn will attack the Griffawn and you.  You really have<br/>\nto risk a few hits to get that fawn to attack the griffenne.  After a bit<br/>\nof practice you can easily do it with no problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3)  It sucks when you choose a greenie too small.  You tell it to attack and<br/>\n&gt; it runs off...  Once one brought back GF.  I don&#39;t have a MM yet, but I was<br/>\n&gt; able to stay ahead of GF.  I did get to zone safe on that one.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>\n&gt; stories about GF&#39;s speed?  Did I just get lucky?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes that happened to me a number of times too.  Died to GF about 2 times<br/>\nin my times trying to perfect this hunting technique.  Another horrbile<br/>\nside effect of charm is never to charm anything near guards.  If the<br/>\nguards have hit your pet once and the Guard is at the top of the hatelist<br/>\nwhen you charm you are in very big trouble.  I got whacked by the gypsies<br/>\nin NK in this manner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4)  If you are like me, give it up in the rain.  I killed 2 of them in the<br/>\n&gt; rain, but both times I had a bubble of life left, mostly because of messed<br/>\n&gt; up timings on switch back to Selo.  I have no sense of direction or speed in<br/>\n&gt; the fog.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The fog is perhaps the most dangerous time to do this in.  The only way it<br/>\nbecomes feasible is to run a circle really close to the zone.  If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t you get some unexpected surprises.  This happened to me in my first<br/>\nGF death.  Was charm/kiting two fennes and then one of them insta died.<br/>\nShould have ran immediately.  Oh well at least I was greated with the ever<br/>\nfriendly.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoading please wait...<br/>\nYou are in Greater Faydark <br/>\n<br/>\nDOH!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 11 attempts attempts and no charms :-(.  Oh well, back at it again tonight.<br/>\n&gt; This was my very first Solo&#39;ing experience in 27 levels as a bard, and I<br/>\n&gt; must admit it was fun, although VERY time consuming.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you can get a friend who is a ranger soloing in the SK Aviak Village is<br/>\nsooo easy.  I was abble to get a level 26 ranger and myself a level 27<br/>\nbard to hunt there.   We were able to kill Aviak Rooks with extreme ease.<br/>\nIn fact we were able to kill 4 in a row with next to no downtime.  THe<br/>\nonly problem is that place is camped everynight and you will go insane<br/>\ntrying to find a rook or harrier to kill.  Gotta love snare/fear ^_^.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nBard of Kelethin<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
