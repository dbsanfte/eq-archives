With the current state of the art, you<br/>\nreally cannot support this type of play-density (one party per<br/>\ndungeon) at $10/mo.  A viable alternative at present is<br/>\nsetting up your own server and inviting only your friends to<br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think spawning a new copy of a dungeon for each party<br/>\nis the solution.  I think the long-term solution is to just<br/>\nmake the game world so large that the players-per-zone density<br/>\n(using the term &quot;zone&quot; loosely) is low enough that running<br/>\ninto another party in a dungeon is a rarity.  To discourage<br/>\ncamping, you could tweak down the spawn rates, and make<br/>\nfinding the &quot;boss&quot; mob that drops the nice items contingent on<br/>\nyour party killing enough of the &quot;trash&quot; mobs (with random<br/>\nvariances of course).  So to get the nice item, you have to<br/>\nfind the &quot;boss.&quot;  To get the &quot;boss&quot; you have to clear the<br/>\ntrash.  To clear the trash, you have to sweep through the<br/>\ndungeon because sitting in one place waiting for a respawn<br/>\nwould take too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;d also need to tweak the AI to discourage pull-camping.  <br/>\nThe reason it works in EQ is because the mob AI is<br/>\npredictable, and IMHO once it&#39;s predictable, it&#39;s not AI<br/>\nanymore.  Better AI would also let the dungeon deal with<br/>\nmassive raids (i.e. people think it&#39;s too hard to do it in a<br/>\nsmall party so bring in 30 friends to clear everything<br/>\neasily).  Instead of the mobs fighting, they see the army, run<br/>\naway, and build their own army.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, the really worrying thing about all this is that in<br/>\nreal life, in a typical food chain, the &quot;prey&quot; has about 10x<br/>\nthe biomass of the &quot;predator.&quot;  And that&#39;s for predators<br/>\nkilling only for sustinence.  If that translates over to<br/>\nonline RPGs (and you could probably come up with a good<br/>\nargument that it doesn&#39;t), you&#39;re talking about the server<br/>\nneeding to control at least 10x as many NPCs as PCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if you assume we&#39;re at about a 1:1 ratio of NPCs<br/>\nand PCs right now, and Moore&#39;s Law says that in about 5 years<br/>\ncomputers will be 10x faster...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
