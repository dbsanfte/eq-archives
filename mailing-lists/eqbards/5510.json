I am a computer auditor by profession<br/>\n&gt; (security is in the blood, sadly!) and I have quite a bit of knowledge<br/>\n&gt; of computer security/logs/exploits/whatever you might want to call it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe I was sleepwalking and bizarrely did this.  Maybe an obscure<br/>\n&gt; burglar broke in, left all my valuables and electricals, logged on,<br/>\n&gt; guessed my password, sold all my virtual gear, and then logged out and<br/>\n&gt; left my home untouched.  At least that&#39;s an entertaining thought ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll log in to EQ tonight again in the hope that a GM shows up at a<br/>\n&gt; reasonable hour (or at least while I&#39;m still awake and functioning!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And until then, I&#39;ll keep singing and playing music to raise spirits,<br/>\n&gt; just like a good bard should!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 23 Aug 1999 16:12:47 PDT, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Lost Child&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lostchild@...\">lostchild@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Would any of your friends/relatives have or can guess your station name and <br/>\n&gt; &gt;password?  Do you have a spouse that is really upset with you spending too <br/>\n&gt; &gt;much time on EQ?  Maybe he/she guessed your password and gave all your stuff <br/>\n&gt; &gt;away.  Did you ever visit some everquest websites which you need to create <br/>\n&gt; &gt;an account with user name and password?  Are either the user name or the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;password same as your EQ login ones?  Have you ever sign any EQ class <br/>\n&gt; &gt;petition with your station name?  Is your password easy to guess?  Did you <br/>\n&gt; &gt;make the password the same as the surname of your character?  That is the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;first thing a hacker would guess.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It seems like there can be only one reason.  Somehow, someone got hold of <br/>\n&gt; &gt;your station name and password.
