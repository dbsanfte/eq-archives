Yes I&#39;ve led a very<br/>\n&gt; sheltered life-but back to my original question-any help would be<br/>\n&gt; appreciated- or is there a better weapon out there i should look for-I dont<br/>\n&gt; get alot of  play time-most I can play at one stretch is maybe 3-4 hours on<br/>\n&gt; a night when the little woman is asleep :)- so I cant really do a 10 hour +<br/>\n&gt; marathon.<br/>\n&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated. By the way, this is gotta be the best<br/>\n&gt; list out there :)-Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scanna Swiftsinger<br/>\n&gt; 34th Chorus<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxx Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with<br/>\n&gt; the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
