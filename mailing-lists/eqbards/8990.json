So i go to the cemetary, i see a<br/>\n&gt; named invisible npc with a book in hand named something like Ssinn or<br/>\n&gt; something like that. Hmmm i think to myself, maybe its the red robe npc and<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s green to me and scowling ready to attack.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyways, to make a long story short, i screwed up big time, Turns out it was<br/>\n&gt; a quest npc for the sol ro temple<br/>\n&gt; your faction with sol ro got worse<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh.  We did the same thing.  I&#39;m constantly telling everyone<br/>\nto con stuff before they attack, because I&#39;ll end up receiving<br/>\nany bad faction hits they take.  But as usual they charged<br/>\nright in and attacked, and considering we had three other mobs<br/>\non us at the time (yeah, another guy was pulling while this<br/>\nwas going on), I didn&#39;t have much choice but to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis book guy is like all shadowmen - he /cons ready to<br/>\nattack, but is non-aggressive.  Hail him.  If he calls you a<br/>\npiece of refuse, hit him with the faction song.  He should<br/>\ntell you about a quest to retrieve a flower from inside the<br/>\ncrypt.  Go inside the crypt (walk straight in because on<br/>\neither side of the floor is a pit trap).  On the coffin<br/>\nthere&#39;s a bag, which is really a flower.  Pick it up and give<br/>\nit to the book.  The flower respawns every few minutes so you<br/>\ncan do this over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re beyond the point where the faction song helps, then<br/>\nI hear there are other quests you can do to raise your faction<br/>\nwith Solusek Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways /con and hail new stuff before you attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
