None of the L50+ enchanters in our guild seem to have this problem.<br/>\nThe other night camping a Veeshan&#39;s key piece in Karnor&#39;s sewers our<br/>\nenchanter was keeping 6+ mobs under control pretty well continuously<br/>\nmost of the night, thanks to the lovely bugs down there. Just when we&#39;d<br/>\nwork down to the last couple of mobs, another couple would drop through<br/>\nthe ceiling on us to add to the fun. If it wasn&#39;t for clarity 2 and the<br/>\nbard playing cantata non-stop we probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to<br/>\nhandle it for as long as we did, but it was great, intense fun until we<br/>\nfinally got an 11+ pull and had to evac.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a bard could even keep 3 mezzed it would at least make grouping at<br/>\n50+ a bit more fun than having to sit around until an enchanter logged<br/>\non to go to Sebilis or HS. Once you pass 55 even pickup groups in<br/>\nKarnors stop being an option as the front mobs turn mostly green.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
