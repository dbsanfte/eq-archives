What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am wearing the shin<br/>\ngreaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I have never seen<br/>\nanyone else with legs that are this color.  They appear to be a rose tinged<br/>\nsilvery hue on me and ever since I put them on I constantly get &quot;XXXXXX is<br/>\nexamining your equipment&quot; or whatever that message is.  The wood elf females<br/>\nI have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged.  Is this the<br/>\nnormal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?  If the rose color is normal<br/>\nthen I guess I have never seen any wood elves in steel plate on E&#39;ci.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
