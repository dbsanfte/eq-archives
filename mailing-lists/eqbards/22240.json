We assumed that high wall was the zone wall when hunting<br/>\nthere once, and the monk ran up it to avoid getting a second mob on a pull.<br/>\nHe went over the top and fell to his death. I got a lev ring from our mage<br/>\nand went corpse hunting. Over the top of the wall and down again, it looks<br/>\nlike a canyon, but I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s any real exit. I loc&#39;ed the corpse<br/>\nand pulled it out by finding one piece of the rockwall slanted enough to let<br/>\nthe combo of Selo&#39;s and the lev get me and the corpse out. We came out near<br/>\nthe statue. I never had the time since to go back and follow it the other<br/>\ndirection. Having fallen through the world a couple times, it gave me the<br/>\nwillies to top that steep wall both ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
