Try it both ways and<br/>\ndetermine which way works best for you.  I personally use a Staff of<br/>\nWrithing and Gnoll Hide Lariet....  I&#39;m hell on casters because if we run<br/>\ninto one I volley-fire pixie strike at them (rarely does a casting npc get<br/>\noff more than 1 or 2 spells in a battle with me doing that).  The stun<br/>\neffect of the whip is nice and the staff does a lot of dmg by itself so<br/>\ntogether they work out to be an ok combination.  If I&#39;m going for raw dmg I<br/>\nthrow in my Silvery Axe instead of the lariet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think, in your case, you&#39;d be better off with the Shard in your<br/>\noffhand.  Bottom line:  The axe is going to net you a lot more dmg because<br/>\nof its shorter delay.  In combat I&#39;ve found that weapons just don&#39;t proc<br/>\nenough for the effect to outweigh a 3-4 point speed advantage (dmg being<br/>\nequal).<br/>\n<br/>\nHard to tell without doing any comparisons though.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Robert Tortajada &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bobt@...\">bobt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, February 21, 2000 6:09 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Duel Wield (which hand?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Robert Tortajada &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bobt@...\">bobt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, I know that you want to keep your best weapon in the primary hand, but<br/>\nhow do you apply that rule when<br/>\n&gt; one weapon has an effect. I have a silvery war axe and an Obsidian Shard.<br/>\nBoth have damage 6. However,<br/>\n&gt; the shard has a longer delay and an effect and the axe has a shorter<br/>\ndelay. Which is better in the<br/>\n&gt; primary? My uderstanding of how the effect works is that if I putt it in<br/>\nthe secondary hand, the effect<br/>\n&gt; roll will only happen when the duel wield goes off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bob T<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
