Below is just a sample from E&#39;ci that I took in the off-peak<br/>\n&gt;hours when I could get some actual numbers.  Note that &#39;Anonymous&#39; will<br/>\n&gt;lower the numbers shown for some classes, but typically should be fairly<br/>\n&gt;equal for all classes except those with high &quot;request&quot; factors like druids,<br/>\n&gt;shamans, enchanters, and clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you should probably try at peak times with the flag &#39;&#39;count&#39;&#39;, i.e. /who all<br/>\ncleric count.<br/>\nthat will give you just the number instead of listing the names of each<br/>\nperson.<br/>\nanon will tend to lower the numbers for certain classes like<br/>\ndruids/clerics/enchanters<br/>\nwho are already well represented it seems like.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso, there is a difference between &#39;&#39;perceived&#39;&#39; power and &#39;&#39;actual&#39;&#39;<br/>\npower.  there is a lot<br/>\nof player ignorance on what a bard can actually do.  that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily mean the<br/>\nactual power needs to be pumped, just the perception.  at level 55 i still<br/>\nrun across people<br/>\nwho say &#39;&#39;oh i didn&#39;t know a bard could do that&#39;&#39;.  There also tends to be a<br/>\nlot of twinking/PLing<br/>\nof the key big raid classes by uberguilds, i.e. warrior, cleric, enchanter,<br/>\nwizard.  that will tend to<br/>\nskew numbers as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Note these numbers are the averages over 4 nites at around 3am mst.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Warriors                32+     too many to list<br/>\n&gt;         Rogues          9.5<br/>\n&gt;         Monks                   5.5<br/>\n&gt;         Rangers         30<br/>\n&gt;         Paladins                27<br/>\n&gt;         Shadowknights   17.5<br/>\n&gt;         Bards                   5<br/>\n&gt;         Wizards         19.25<br/>\n&gt;         Magicians               29.75<br/>\n&gt;         Necromancers    32+     too many to list<br/>\n&gt;         Enchanters              25+     One night there were too many to<br/>\n&gt;list<br/>\n&gt;         Clerics         31+     Two nights there were too many to list<br/>\n&gt;         Druids          32+     too many to list<br/>\n&gt;         Shamans         23.75<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         With over 600 people on the server this means that either half the<br/>\n&gt;server was      Anonymous or Roleplaying (Highly unlikely) or those classes<br/>\n&gt;which were too many     to list were actually much, much higher than 32 in<br/>\n&gt;number.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         <br/>\n&gt;         Kitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
