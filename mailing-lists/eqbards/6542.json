It is<br/>\njust hearsay, but this is what someone told me...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; It is now called the Stein of Moggok. I got my character who i used<br/>\nto kill the fish for the quest in qeynos to see if they changed it just<br/>\nfor fun. This is what i found, the fish is now the god Rodcet Nife. Hit<br/>\nme for 244pts dam in one bite. Then proceeded to call me a puny<br/>\nmortal.Not sure if the fish can be killed anymore. Just my experience<br/>\nwith it:)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t tried it, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true. But then again, I<br/>\nnever tried it before.
