I have 3 chants<br/>\nmemmed and selos in the first 4 slots.  The trick with sticking all 3 for<br/>\nme, is stick the first two, be within range of the mob, cast the 3rd chant<br/>\nand haul arse while selos icon is still up... on a good lag day, i can see<br/>\nthe song hasn&#39;t been resisted, the selos icon will fall, and I&#39;ll be<br/>\nstopping my 3rd chant and begin selos. selo&#39;s will be up in time for me for<br/>\nmy feet to move faster just as the mob is catching up. Now this is way<br/>\nharder if the mob has natural SoW or faster. Snow griffins, shadowmen, and<br/>\nother speedy mobs i don&#39;t recommend trying the 3rd chant. If you have<br/>\njboots, you can kite slow mobs around all day<br/>\nOne bard on my server was telling me how easy that was. I thought it was an<br/>\ninsult to our class to even wear/use jboots, much less occupy the AC camp<br/>\nfor that period of time, when someone who clearly needs them more than you<br/>\ncould be in it.<br/>\nHehe and I tire of getting in groups where I have to travel, I&#39;m forever<br/>\ntelling them to click off lev/sow/jboots, so they can keep up (with selos),<br/>\nor go invis (with song of travel). Where have these people been ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBack on topic... that&#39;s for travel. this is for battle without<br/>\nshaman/chanter....<br/>\n<br/>\n#1 Elemental - for any unexpected caster encounters<br/>\n#2 Chorus of Celerity (45%haste iirc)<br/>\n#3 Chant of Battle - Stacks with everything I love it :)<br/>\n#4 Largo&#39;s Binding - 40%?? target slow/snare<br/>\n#5 Cantana of Replenishment - mana/stam/hp regen - I&#39;ll toss in a pulse or<br/>\ntwo for the ailing tanks when they&#39;re fatigued<br/>\n#6 Niv&#39;s Melody of Pres. - A great song to stack with #5 for hp regen when<br/>\nhealer is medding hard. (equip lute of course)<br/>\n<br/>\n#7-10 are various hotkeys, a bag slot with all my weapons, /assist hotkey,<br/>\nand my 1st and 2nd melee slot<br/>\n<br/>\nWith chanter/shaman<br/>\nI&#39;ll substitute #2 haste for L50 VoV. It&#39;s a nice str/ac/atk buff.<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;ll take  snare out of the rotation if there&#39;s a competent<br/>\nranger/druid, but I *still* keep memmed. (accidents happen)      and I&#39;ll<br/>\nput in dmg shield or something completely random hehe. (for laughs I like to<br/>\nput in melifluous motion LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nNever a dull moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger tells the group, &quot;wtf?&quot;<br/>\nBard tells the group, &quot;LOL!!&quot;<br/>\nChanter tells the group, &quot;/sigh&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPava<br/>\nCT<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. Just last night i had to use that song to get someone unstuck while he<br/>\nwas in a trade window with someone after Trakanon. He said his computer was<br/>\nacting strange. I said hold on boys!! *swishing sound* He was like cool! The<br/>\nbards and their songs...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
