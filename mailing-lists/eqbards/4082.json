(As a matter of fact, does anyone know which creatures in<br/>\n&gt; the game can innately see invisible?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The strange behavior with the invis song is that if any member of the<br/>\nparty<br/>\n&gt; does ANYTHING to drop their invis like cast a spell, or are in Auto Attack<br/>\n&gt; mode (whether actually attacking or not) and another mob targets them,<br/>\nthen<br/>\n&gt; that mob will see everyone else in the party regardless of whether they<br/>\n&gt; appear to be invisible or not.  One member of your group on a monster&#39;s<br/>\nshit<br/>\n&gt; list adds everyone in your group to that monster&#39;s shit list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Every tick of the invis song causes a skill check to be made and every now<br/>\n&gt; and then a character will fail, and turn visible for a single tick, until<br/>\n&gt; the next tick of the song and then they pop invisible again.  While this<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; uncommon, it does happen, and during that tick of visibility, if you are<br/>\n&gt; near enough to a mob to be noticed and targeted, invis is shot for the<br/>\nwhole<br/>\n&gt; group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This seems to fall under the group hate thing...where a bard singing Hymn<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &quot;helping&quot; the members of his party (like the puller for example) so the<br/>\nmob<br/>\n&gt; targets the bard - just like when a cleric heals another group member it<br/>\n&gt; often attracts the monster&#39;s attention.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But all alone with the mino horn and a skill of 105 in wind I sang<br/>\nClouding<br/>\n&gt; and wandered all over the first 3 floors of the Unrest mansion invisible,<br/>\n&gt; checking it all out...at one point the 2 hags from the basement walked<br/>\nRIGHT<br/>\n&gt; past me through the hall and just about made my heart jump out my throat,<br/>\n&gt; but did not see me at all.  This is a fun song to play with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Faras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 2:40 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [eqbards] Bards in Unrest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A similar thing happened to me twice when I was camping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behind the back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; porch.  One time, my group was resting after a fight.  I had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been using<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Denon&#39;s Discord during the previous fight.  While everyone is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resting, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back door opens up and a festering hag makes a beeline<br/>\n&gt; &gt; towards me.  Next<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing I know she zaps me for 300+ hit points and I&#39;m dead.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If there is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bug with the  axis whatever is it something that Verant is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aware of and is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; working on fixing?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snipped from earlier post by Faras&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last night in Unrest I camped off the side porch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because there was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discussion that singing songs off the back porch might<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be affecting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mobs in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the basement due to an unlimited Z axis affect bug.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also did not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around and sing songs while our puller was in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; house...I waited<br/>\n&gt; &gt; until our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill was brought to the fence and whacked once or twice and then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kicked in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my playlist.  This worked awesome and I did not die once.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t think the bards invis song worked against undead.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fact I have been attacked by zombies before while singing the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; song.  Can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone clarify this please.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think the people I group with generally recognize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that I do a lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bard, shuffling instruments and weapons, jumping in and out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; physical<br/>\n&gt; &gt; melee, playing a variety of different songs, some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;simultaneously&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they also recognize the benefit of our songs because I tell them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;check out your magic resist&quot; and get the &quot;wholly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; crap!&quot; or invis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while they are medding and they are amazed that it works against<br/>\n&gt; &gt; undead too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our party was sitting against the fence medding and watching a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Festering Hag<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run around the yard wasting people, finally being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; killed by a group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only 15<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feet away from us - we watched the whole thing as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group leader<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nervously<br/>\n&gt; &gt; commented &quot;don&#39;t stop singing that song Faras...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; See homepage for details on ONElist&#39;s new &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY&quot; program.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
