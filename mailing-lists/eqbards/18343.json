I guess i think of the choke line as<br/>\na debuff, not a DOT as the damage on it is rather small.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually don&#39;t like telling other people what to do.  If I see<br/>\nsomething really bad, like healers not healing when people are low I<br/>\nwill say something.  I also always harp on assisting the tank, but<br/>\npeople never seem to figure that one out.  People do all kind of crazy<br/>\nthings, &quot;Damage shields are worthless&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t think you need SOW to<br/>\npull.&quot;.  My reaction depends on my mood mostly.  If they want me to pull<br/>\nand won&#39;t SOW me (this being my troll warrior, not my self SOWing bard),<br/>\nhe will just sit there till he gets a SOW or sees a mob withing bow<br/>\nrange.  He will not move.  You don&#39;t want to give me hp/ac buffs?  Fine,<br/>\nbut don&#39;t assume I&#39;m going to keep taunting stuff off you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really hate getting pick up groups, but fortunatly I have a good<br/>\nmemory, so I know who to refuse to group with.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
