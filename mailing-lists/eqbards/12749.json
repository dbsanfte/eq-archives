I cannot get it to work...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve used this a lot:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1.  Target an NPC.<br/>\n&gt;2.  Sing the song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Notes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1.  Counters can get in the way.  You&#39;ll see a failure message (target is<br/>\n&gt;too far away?  target is not visible?  not sure, but you&#39;ll see one).<br/>\n&gt;Stand next to him/her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2.  It&#39;s a wind-based song, it will be better when you can use your flute<br/>\n&gt;(which you will really only be able to practice when you get underwater<br/>\n&gt;song).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3.  It raises the /con level of the target, but it might not raise it<br/>\n&gt;enough to change the text.  Since I assume that it gets better with<br/>\n&gt;leveling, and you&#39;re low, this might be playing a part.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4.  It&#39;s possible for your charisma to be high enough that you already<br/>\n&gt;have the best available price, and changing the /con won&#39;t make a<br/>\n&gt;difference.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5.  It affects ALL members of a faction within the same zone at the time<br/>\n&gt;you sing it, so once you&#39;ve done it to one merchant, you&#39;ve probably<br/>\n&gt;changed the rest already (since, for the most part, they&#39;re all the same<br/>\n&gt;faction).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;6.  If you sing it to a member of another faction, you lose your effect<br/>\n&gt;with any previous faction you&#39;ve sung it to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;7.  It appears to last until you zone, although it&#39;s possible that it is<br/>\n&gt;just very long-lasting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
