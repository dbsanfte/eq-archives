I had never thought of that.  This is one of my fears, that there are so many ways I could be using my songs but just don&#39;t know about.  Someone needs to make a list of songs with ALL possible uses we have found.  Since I play on PvP it does make some of the songs tougher to use, for example in Cazic Thule, there are so many people around if I use sleep or melodic binding I get something like &quot;Lizard Protector&#39;s head nods&quot; &quot;WandatheWizard head nods&quot; RodneytheRanger head nods&quot; etc. Needless to say they are not happy with their little nap ; ) I use the same 2 or 3 songs over and over and don&#39;t want to miss out on something potentially awesome!  Also anyone with pets in my group automatically attack me when I sing any non-party song.  Another thing is that the invis song KILLS pets instantly. Is that just on my server or everywhere?  Love the information I get from here, keep up the great work!<br/>\n<br/>\nInfiniti<br/>\nLevel 29 Bard<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
