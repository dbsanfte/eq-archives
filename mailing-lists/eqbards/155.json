Dex","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1650413896\">Greetings all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI did some test to find out the efficiency of Jonathans Warsong and <br/>\nAnthem de Arms. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all I am a 10th level Bard with singing maxed. Dex is <br/>\n92(base of 90 with +2 ring). For the test I fought Fire Beetles with <br/>\nmy fists. I went against Fire Beetles because they are all the same <br/>\nlevel and they dont run away. I used my fists to get more attacks in <br/>\nper combat thus giving me a larger sample.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tested \t1. No song active<br/>\n\t\t\t2. Jonathans Warsong active<br/>\n\t\t\t3. Anthem de Arms active\t<br/>\n\t\t\t4. Both song active<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time is the duration of the combat timed with a stop watch.<br/>\nHits is the number of swings during the combat.<br/>\nthe last number is how many seconds per swing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe numbers<br/>\n\t\t\t\tHits\tTime\t<br/>\nNone Active\t12\t\t40\t\t3.3<br/>\n\t\t\t\t15\t\t49\t\t3.26<br/>\n<br/>\nJonath Active\t15\t\t41\t\t2.73<br/>\n\t\t\t\t19\t\t53\t\t2.78<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Active\t14\t\t40\t\t2.85<br/>\n\t\t\t\t13\t\t39\t\t3<br/>\n\t\t\t\t12\t\t35\t\t2.9<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Active\t\t12\t\t33\t\t2.75<br/>\n\t\t\t\t15\t\t39\t\t2.6<br/>\n\t\t\t\t15\t\t40\t\t2.66<br/>\n\t\t\t\t12\t\t32\t\t2.66<br/>\n<br/>\nAnalysis:<br/>\nYour swing rate increases singing these songs. You will get 20% <br/>\nmore attacks with one or the other song active. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem appears to be slower but remember this is a small sample <br/>\nand using a stopwatch is prone to small errors, and I could have <br/>\nmade a mistake, like misscounted the number of hits. But Anthem <br/>\nmay be a tad slower than Jonathans like a 15% increase.<br/>\n<br/>\nlooking at the final set of results it appears that the songs do stack <br/>\nsomewhat, which is interesting. Giving about a 25% increase.<br/>\n<br/>\nConclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn group situations it is clear what songs to play. I usually play a <br/>\ncombination of Anthem, Angels and Chords, sometimes I swap <br/>\nbetween all 3. lately I have favouried Chords over Angels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a solo situation it is not clear for me yet what songs to play and <br/>\nwhen. Lately I have started playing Chords. When soloing at 10th <br/>\nlevel you have a choice of playing 2 or 3 of the following.<br/>\n<br/>\nChant of battle<br/>\nJonathans Warsong<br/>\nChords of Dissonance<br/>\nHymn of Angels<br/>\nAnthem de Arms<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to (before 10th) play Chant, Angels, Jonathans.<br/>\nI have now switched to Chords, Jonathans, Anthem or Chords, <br/>\nJonathans, Chant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does seem to me(I have no hard data) that Chords can make a <br/>\ndifference in a close battle, say over Angels?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe after effects of Anthem do not seem to last as long as the <br/>\nothers this may increase as my singing skill increases.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny Comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nT.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTony Walsh, Video Coding Group<br/>\nTeltec Ireland, DCU, Dublin 9, Ireland<br/>\nTel     : +353-1-7045477<br/>\nFAX     : +353-1-7045092<br/>\nE-mail  : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:walsht@...\">walsht@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
