You see, I had decided (having been there and verified <br/>\nthe safety) to do it in the Arena in Lake Rathe.  Well, 18 came and I <br/>\nam in Kunark.  I am not going all the way to Lake Rathe just to <br/>\npractice! <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said that they think brass skills are checked even when this <br/>\nsong is sung without an instrument.  I am convinced that person <br/>\nwas right.  The number of missed notes I&#39;m having is just astounding <br/>\n(frequently 20 or more in a row).  I realize that missed notes are<br/>\nnot <br/>\nuncommon for a new song, but this is ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and if you have suggestions, please make them somewhere that a <br/>\n&quot;good&quot; level 19 can get to.  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nLyressa (god I hope I put a point into brass before I came over here)<br/>\nThe Nameless</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
