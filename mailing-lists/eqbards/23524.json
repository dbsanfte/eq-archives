Some of the songs have &quot;L#&quot; in Column F.<br/>\nWhat does the &quot;L#&quot; entry supposed to indicate?<br/>\n<br/>\nMight be a problem with Chant of Battle.  When I input any number from 38-60<br/>\nfor my level, &quot;L38&quot; is listed in Column F.  If I type in 36 or 37, this<br/>\nchanges to &quot;L36&quot;.  Any number from 22-35 results in &quot;L22&quot;.  Didn&#39;t try out<br/>\nany lower numbers.  In addition to the &quot;L#&quot; changes, the amount of the<br/>\nSTR/DEX buff changes as well.  Now I haven&#39;t tested Chant of Battle any time<br/>\nrecently to see how much STR/DEX it buffs at level 50, but based on your<br/>\nspreadsheet it maxes at L38.  Any other level higher than 38 has no impact<br/>\non the amount of STR/DEX buff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, when I input &quot;50&quot; for my level, there are several other songs<br/>\nwhich have a &quot;L#&quot; lower than 50.  For songs 7,9,13 and 17, &quot;L36&quot; is listed.<br/>\nFor songs 18, 20, 38 and 46, &quot;L38&quot; is listed.  What exactly does that mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other correction.  For level 49 Shield of Songs, you have that listed as<br/>\nSinging only with a 20 pt runeshield.  Need to add in Lute and 40 pt<br/>\nruneshield as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW great job.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reed Stormwind [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqreed@...\">eqreed@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 24, 2001 3:11 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Reed&#39;s Bard Song Calculator 1.10 Available<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry about the error, and thanks again Galtin.
