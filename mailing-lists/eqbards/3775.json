The problem with necro research is that the words<br/>\nare impossible to find. Currently on E&#39;ci two people on the whole server<br/>\nhave the level 34 Necro pet spell, the first research spell! Nobody levels<br/>\n34-50 besides those two people have a pet spell better then the level 29<br/>\nspell which is the last pet spell. Something is definitly wrong here. As for<br/>\nwizards and Ice Comet at least they know where to look.<br/>\n<br/>\nConaldar<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Patrick Pichette &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:poptart77@...\">poptart77@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, July 16, 1999 9:33 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Offtopic: Asheron&#39;s Call vs. Everquest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Patrick Pichette&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:poptart77@...\">poptart77@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So many people complaining about downtime and exp loss and so on and so<br/>\n&gt;forth.. have any of you read what Asheron&#39;s Call is doing?  They don&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt;to penalize people too harshly with exp so they decided that when you die,<br/>\n&gt;you lose a few of your best items and a percentage of your money.  How&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;that for not penalizing people to travel?  You all complain now at what<br/>\n&gt;Everquest does.. be grateful that it&#39;s the best game of it&#39;s genre at the<br/>\n&gt;moment.  Nothing even comes close to it and I doubt anything will for a<br/>\n&gt;while.  Yes, it has its quirks.  And yes, it&#39;s taking a long time to fix<br/>\n&gt;them all.  But would you have preferred waiting another year while beta<br/>\n&gt;testers worked out all the bugs or enjoy playing the game now and live with<br/>\n&gt;the bugs as they get fixed.  The more people are playing the more bugs are<br/>\n&gt;found quicker and resolved quicker.  Now, there&#39;s just a matter of priority<br/>\n&gt;as to what to fix first.  And quit trying to make every frigging class the<br/>\n&gt;exact same as the other class.  You want to be able to bind?  Play a damn<br/>\n&gt;spell caster.  You want to be able to run fast?  Play a damn bard or shaman<br/>\n&gt;or something.  You want to dish out lots of DD?  Play a wizard.  Just quit<br/>\n&gt;your whining and be grateful that you can&#39;t do exactly the same thing as<br/>\n&gt;every other character in the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m just so tired of hearing people wanting their characters to be god so<br/>\n&gt;they can kill everything in site.. go play Doom and enter god mode if you<br/>\n&gt;want to do that and see how much fun it is after a while.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just my pipe blowing,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pietree<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
