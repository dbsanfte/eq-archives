Although I personally find being without<br/>\nLullaby is a huge downgrade in my usefulness.  I think for me one of the<br/>\ngreatest disappointments was when I finally got Pixie Strike.  I remember<br/>\nlong ago how many people here raved on its effectiveness at stopping<br/>\ncasters.  Since I didn&#39;t get it until they added the secondary resist I<br/>\nnever got to see it be useful.  I still get resisted at least 50% of the<br/>\ntime when trying it.  Some of that time it still disrupts, just doesn&#39;t mez.<br/>\nSadder still, I was having better success using Pixie Strike to pause a<br/>\nfleeing mob so a real snarer &quot;a shadowknight&quot; could get off a darkness spell<br/>\non it.  This was more effective than trying to chain a stupid goblin that<br/>\nflees at just under 50%.  To have a spell that&#39;s primary effect is to slow<br/>\nsomething down nerfed to be below the secondary effect of a DoT is<br/>\nridiculous.  All because Verant is apparently too stupid to have mobs attack<br/>\nwhen their movement is reduced below a certain amount like they do when<br/>\nrooted.  I couldn&#39;t care less if the stupid thing turned around and started<br/>\nwhcking on me again, I just don&#39;t want it running away and killing my entire<br/>\nparty when its friends return.  Of course this was never even considered by<br/>\nVerant who was too busy being horrified that some player might have thought<br/>\nof a tactic that they did not foresee.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n-------------_-&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni don&#39;t think crowd control or dealing without lullaby is the issue for<br/>\nmost.  we have all dealt without lullaby for a year.  it&#39;s the way bards are<br/>\nbeing treated by verant.  as i think kitasi said, i would never have<br/>\nexpected to see lyrnia go as she was an avid supporter of verant decisions<br/>\n(nothing wrong with that, just saying).  the way they make decisions about<br/>\nbards is what i think people can no longer stomach.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
