The psalms don&#39;t stack with anything<br/>\nresistance-related, and I love how people oggle when their MR jumps 100<br/>\npoints.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could be using weapons and a psalm, but my philosophy is if the caster<br/>\nis barely scratching us anyway, it doesn&#39;t matter if it takes a few more<br/>\nseconds to kill it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst spiders in lower guk, I did use the psalm of purity a fair bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
