However, here&#39;s my 2 cp:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 14 level is an appropriate level to be able to bind.  This matches the<br/>\nclasses<br/>\n&gt; that can bind, as clerics are the last to get it at 14th.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The magic model for the Bard class is for us to have prettty much one or two<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; each type of spell.  We have a little speed, DoT, teleport, DD, Heal, etc.<br/>\nThe<br/>\n&gt; only powers we dont have are lifetap or bind.  I don&#39;t think lifetap fits<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; the Bardic image, so bind looks good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other hybrids don&#39;t get bind...but we aren&#39;t really a hybrid class.<br/>\nEach<br/>\n&gt; other hybrid is a warrior/specific magic class.  As a result, they get magic<br/>\n&gt; plus superior battle skills.  Since our battle skills are less than all<br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; hybrids...really on par with clerics if truth be told, then perhaps we can<br/>\nget a<br/>\n&gt; pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, bind would be my vote...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Golias of Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
