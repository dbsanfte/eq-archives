Upon further investigation I linked this<br/>\nto the numluck key being lit up.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo replicate, make sure numlock is lit. Hit 6 on the numpad to turn right,<br/>\nthen hit shift, then lift up the 6 key before lifting up shift and watch<br/>\nyourself spin ad infinitum.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor months this was extremely annoying, but controlable through careful<br/>\nmonitoring of the numlock light. Then a few patches ago, things<br/>\ndeteriorated. Now, shift in conjunction with other keys has a chance to lock<br/>\nthat key. I&#39;ve seen my back space key locked, my shift key locked and<br/>\nmovement keys locked. Fortunately, the temporary fix is easy, just hit shift<br/>\nagain and it will unlock the key. In terms of a more permanent fix, I<br/>\nsuggest reverting to win 98 or win 95. I have been unable to replicate this<br/>\non either of those OSes and everyone I&#39;ve spoken with that has the bug is on<br/>\nwin 2k.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nMinstrel of Karan<br/>\nTribunal Server<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Tatsukawa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john@...\">john@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 16, 2000 2:11 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Sliding problems<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had big problems last night with my movement keys. I use a lot of &quot;slide <br/>\nleft&quot; and &quot;slide right&quot; movement in battle (old Doom/Quake habit). However, <br/>\nI noticed now that when I press the &quot;shift&quot; key to slide, it locks me in <br/>\nthe same direction of movement (if I were turning then I start spinning).<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent a bug report in last night, and even submitted a petition. Was <br/>\nsurprised a guide contacted me (since I said that this was a low priority <br/>\nin the grand scheme of things) and he told me to try to press my right <br/>\nmouse button to slide. I tried this, even though I usually use my right <br/>\nhand for the movement keys, but it didn&#39;t work. He didn&#39;t have any idea <br/>\nwhat I could try to fix, since I mentioned I even tried remapping the <br/>\nhistory commands to different keys.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe suggested I wipe my opt files, but I just did that last week, so <br/>\neverything is pretty clean. So I submitted a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else had similar problems and if so, anyone figure a way to fix<br/>\nit?<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
