I can sometimes spot them per <br/>\nenglish skills but most times not, ingame. Then its the &#39;where are you, <br/>\nanway?&#39; routine. We have several Eurpoeans in our guild but only 1 is <br/>\nusually on at anything remotely like our American play hours. I have run <br/>\ninto the odd Japanese ocassionally on Xegony during our play hours but their <br/>\nmain continent is logging about the time we are getting started. We also <br/>\nhave a few French Canadians in our guild. You would think Canadians would be <br/>\nvery close to Americans but not always. The thing that will trip you up <br/>\nfastest with folks of different countries is culture references. Sometimes <br/>\nits harmless:<br/>\n<br/>\nGuild wizard (american) meets guild barbarian warrior (canadian) for the <br/>\nfirst time:<br/>\nWiz: You look like Peter Rabbit in that horned helm!<br/>\nBarb: Umm, who is Peter Rabbit?<br/>\n<br/>\nI always take it as a new opportunity to learn things. We are going to try <br/>\nout the BattleField Communicator this week and the Canadian is already <br/>\nworried about his speaking English and accent. And then there&#39;s me with my <br/>\nSouthern Drawl. I can&#39;t wait, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
