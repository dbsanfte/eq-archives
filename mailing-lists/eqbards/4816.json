He is fully outfitted with<br/>\nbanded armor with a couple of bronze pieces mixed in (not tunic and leggings<br/>\nthough)  When I created him, I envisioned him protecting himself in combat<br/>\nby being quick on his feet and dodging blows instead of wearing heavy armor.<br/>\nHowever, I have since learned that Dodge isn&#39;t always reliable and that I<br/>\nmay have to change my view.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have gotten enough STR boosting items to raise my STR up to 89.  That<br/>\nstill isn&#39;t enough STR to wear bronze plate and have any room left over for<br/>\ncarrying loot.  My best option may be to get some rubicite but that will be<br/>\na long time down the road.  In the meantime, I need some advice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of trying to obtain additional STR boosting items, should I instead<br/>\nstart loading up on AGI raising items?  I&#39;m hardly ever the main tank so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t really need extra STR for causing extra damage.  I primarily need it<br/>\nso I can carry more stuff.  I&#39;m hoping I can offset not wearing bronze armor<br/>\nby increasing my AGI which will in turn increase my chance to Dodge. I can<br/>\nequip the STR items if I get encumbered.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA factor in this decision is this: Does the type of armor have an impact on<br/>\namount of damage received.  I know better armor increases AC but does it<br/>\nalso reduce damage taken?  For example, I get hit in combat and the random<br/>\nnumber generator says I take 40 points of damage.  Currently I&#39;m wearing<br/>\nCrush&#39;s ringmail tunic.  If I was wearing bronze plate, would the damage I<br/>\nreceived be lower, say like 30pts, due to the plate armor reducing the force<br/>\nof the attack?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny and all suggestions welcomed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
