Well, when i recieved the sneak skill two<br/>\n&gt; lvls ago, i put 3 points into it hoping to try it out...nothing.  The<br/>\n&gt; hide skill is not allowing me to use it.  So i thought maybe if i put<br/>\n&gt; some more points into the sneak skill it would cycle the button through<br/>\n&gt; faster.  It didn&#39;t.  So far i have put 8 skill points into sneak and<br/>\n&gt; have not been able to use it once.  Is this normal?  or do you all think<br/>\n&gt; that maybe mine is screwed up?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tadian of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why do WOMEN ASTRONAUTS have such BAD HAIRCUTS?<br/>\n&gt; What happens if you CLEAN your self-cleaning OVEN?  <br/>\n&gt; The DR. has answers:&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.drscience.com/u\">http://www.drscience.com/u</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
