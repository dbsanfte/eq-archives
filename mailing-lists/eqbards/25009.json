Months","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-817215031\">I just recently upgraded because of the same problem, frame rate.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow what was going to give me what I wanted.  So I played hit and miss.<br/>\nMonths back I went from 128 meg of PC100 memory to 256 PC100.  I didn&#39;t get<br/>\nany noticeable improvement.  I replaced my 300a Celeron (overclocked to<br/>\n450) with a P3 700 three weeks ago (fastest chip the mobo will take).<br/>\nThere was a huge improvement in frame rate.  I can keep my clipping plane<br/>\nmaxed in burning woods and still have a _nearly_ flicker free run.  I fact<br/>\nI did auto-follow through there a few days ago with out a problem.<br/>\nHowever, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.  If I turn the<br/>\nclipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a decent trade off<br/>\nin viewable distance and twisting time.  Right now I feel the TNT card is<br/>\nholding me back the rest of the way.  But with Luclin coming out later in<br/>\nthe year I want to wait and upgrade the video card then.  To what I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow yet, depends on the prices and Verant&#39;s recommendations.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are my current system specs:<br/>\nP3 700 (Slot 1)<br/>\nAbit BX6 Rev 2 Motherboard<br/>\n256 PC100 RAM (Two 64 meg and one 128 meg, all CL 2, don&#39;t know the brand)<br/>\nSound Blaster Graphics Blaster TNT 16 meg AGP<br/>\nSound Blaster Live!<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve<br/>\n46 Bard<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:26 PM 6/12/01 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Tallies, I figured this a topic of interest even if not directly related to <br/>\n&gt;barding.

I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But more memory and a better <br/>\n&gt;graphics card are in reach due to Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram - <br/>\n&gt;done.  So now I want to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards <br/>\n&gt;they use, have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything else <br/>\n&gt;of note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate in WW and some <br/>\n&gt;places in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down and hope they don&#39;t scrape me <br/>\n&gt;off on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine Luclin without a better card.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks again for all the help,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Piemur Draggonsinger 42 bard<br/>\n&gt;Robiinton Masterrhealer 32 cleric </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
