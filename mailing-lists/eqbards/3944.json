Ever since lvl 30 and up i noticed i<br/>\ncould start using all those songs that just got me killed asap before.<br/>\nLargos was the quickest way for me to kill myself in unrest when i was<br/>\naround lvl 20 since one pulse of the song and everything ganked me, nm that<br/>\nall the tanks and wizies almost had it dead. Now at lvl 43 im trying out<br/>\nall the songs that i wanted to before and finding out that most creatures<br/>\njust dont care. They go right on attacking the proper person :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI just rememberd when i was lvl 20 how discouraged i got over the &#39;Gank the<br/>\nbard first&#39; syndrom that most of the mobs seem to suffer from. Now i still<br/>\nget attacked a lot, but it seems much more in tune with what everybody else<br/>\nhas to suffer through. <br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 43 bard<br/>\n3 time recipient of the &#39;Worst dressed on tunare&#39; award.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
