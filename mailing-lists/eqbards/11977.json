I suspect that the relative taunt values of our lower level songs are highest at this point.  I got<br/>\nkilled in Cazic 8 times in two consecutive evenings.  And I was bound in High Keep, so most of my time was<br/>\ntaken up in travelling.  I got killed in whatever-the-heck-Karana is next to High Keep four times in the<br/>\nlast bubble of 21.  I got killed... oh, never mind.  There was just about nothing I could have done about<br/>\nit except stop singing altogether (and even that didn&#39;t stop the two Ice Giants, eh, Harmonic?), and that<br/>\nseemed pretty pointless.  So I did the cop-out approach:  I went to High Keep.  You can also probably<br/>\ngroup/solo the crocs/caimans in Oasis.  I did that on and off over a couple of levels.  Just remember:<br/>\nthis will pass, my son.  ;)  (My roommate is standing looking over my shoulder saying &quot;I remember what it<br/>\nwas like back then - you were SO MAD!&quot;  hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 35 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
