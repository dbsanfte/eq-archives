And someone saying this is being imagined<br/>\nbecause someone brought it to our attention. What I am saying is I never<br/>\nmissed notes on the bulk of my songs prior to 2 weeks ago. I have not gone<br/>\nout and kept track of #s because it isnt realistic to what I am doing in an<br/>\neverchanging battle situation. I am in Lower Guk, the #s and types of mobs<br/>\nis so fluid I may have to go from one strategy to a completely different one<br/>\nmid battle, and a missed note can cause the death of our whole party. Dont<br/>\nlaugh till you&#39;ve been there, all frogs are not created equal. If I cant<br/>\nplay my twisted tunes I may as well sing the Mana song and melee without<br/>\nworrying about being a Bard anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Robertson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 11, 1999 1:48 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Missed Notes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh sorry, thought I gave you numbers, I tried to use Denons 30 times and<br/>\n&gt; missed notes everytime.

Not exactly precise<br/>\nnumbers.<br/>\nSo you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s a 100 percent failure rate on a sample size of<br/>\n30?  I<br/>\ncertainly understand why you&#39;d be upset.  Thing is, that&#39;s awfully hard to<br/>\nbelieve when I haven&#39;t had a failure rate of higher than 10 percent on any<br/>\nsong<br/>\nI&#39;ve tested with recently.  Nobody else is claiming 100 percent failure<br/>\nrates<br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to be combative here, I&#39;m trying to figure out, with a little<br/>\nrigor, what&#39;s happening here, because simply bitching about it isn&#39;t going<br/>\nto<br/>\nget the problem fixed, if there is one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\nDrawing is held each week through August 20.
