I think I posted this once<br/>\nback when ME came out too.<br/>\n<br/>\nME grafted in a lot of Microsoft&#39;s NT OS in its kernel code.  Err .. what<br/>\nthis means for those of you that don&#39;t develop OS&#39;s - if the driver<br/>\nmanufacturer had written drivers for Microsoft NT, then they had a BIG jump<br/>\non getting good drivers for Microsoft Windows ME.<br/>\n<br/>\nMicrosoft&#39;s windows kernel code is notoriously buggy (NT less so than 98),<br/>\nas well, as per licensing agreements, they release documentation only at<br/>\ncertain levels of &quot;partnership&quot; (read you sign successively stronger<br/>\nanti-compete clauses to get to learn which parts of MS&#39;s code works best).<br/>\nSo as well, larger companies who already signed these agreements will have<br/>\nmore documentation available.  And if they signed said &quot;partnerships&quot; while<br/>\nwriting NT drivers - they&#39;ll have had good existing code that would take<br/>\nlittle time to make into ME drivers of decent quality.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for a consumer, if the company writing your drivers isn&#39;t big enough (or<br/>\noriented to MS enough) to have signed their &quot;partnership&quot; agreements - AS<br/>\nWELL as having a large enough market to have had prior Windows NT drivers<br/>\nfor thier hardware ... don&#39;t even bother - stay in 98 SE.<br/>\n<br/>\n- this message brought to you by a retired developer -</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
