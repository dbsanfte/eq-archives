You know how to be a bard better than they do.  Hymn is<br/>\nNOT that big a taunt.  Especially in today&#39;s dungeons.  They&#39;re _hardly_<br/>\ndangerous.  I can walk the entire length of lower guk, live to dead side,<br/>\nand I might actually pull a train of 3 critters.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay your class the way you think it should be played.  Generally I find out<br/>\nwho&#39;s doing what and then I go, OK, I&#39;m going to be doing X.  If they argue<br/>\nI simply state &quot;You be a (insert class here), I&#39;ll be a Bard.  If you don&#39;t<br/>\nlike it, lets trade accounts&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat usually shuts them up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line:  You play your character, don&#39;t let others tell you how :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 29, 2000 4:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Attack speedups<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our enchanter seems to have no trouble keeping both tanks Alacrity&#39;d thru<br/>\n&gt; the night and still does crowd control.  Yes I could give us all a<br/>\nspeedup,<br/>\n&gt; but since the only other person even meleeing is a cleric it wouldn&#39;t help<br/>\n&gt; much.  My finger-twiddling is much better spent on Chant of Battle if the<br/>\n&gt; enchanter is there to Alacrity.  If he&#39;s not then Anthem gets back in the<br/>\n&gt; mix.  If bards excel at anything its that we can fill in as a substitute<br/>\n&gt; just-about-anything.  Problem I&#39;m starting to find is that I&#39;m only able<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; get into groups that are lacking something if there isn&#39;t a person looking<br/>\n&gt; to group who&#39;s better at that thing as a primary role.  When I do get in<br/>\n&gt; lately its always as a tank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last 3 nites:  Don&#39;t chain, we&#39;re darknessing.  Don&#39;t anthem we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; alacritying.  Don&#39;t Chant we&#39;re skin like something or othering.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nHymn<br/>\n&gt; or you&#39;ll get too much attention and die.  Didn&#39;t leave much of anything<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; me to do but swing, bellow and go owie.  Occasionally we&#39;d pull a wizard<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; shaman gobie and I&#39;d throw the resistances in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Towards the end of the night I get asked in group tell, &quot;Can&#39;t you do<br/>\n&gt; anything but Bellow?  I thought bards had all kinds of cool songs.&quot;  My<br/>\n&gt; reply?  Didn&#39;t have one, told them &quot;I am retiring to the OOT to<br/>\ncontemplate<br/>\n&gt; life while beating head on gargoyles for a while.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kit<br/>\n&gt; one very wet minstrel with a headache<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Perhaps a Princess...

Add onto this that there is a speed<br/>\n&gt; beyond which a weapon can&#39;t get any faster. And Swift Like the Wind,<br/>\n&gt; in higher levels, isn&#39;t even used on people with haste sashes. Not<br/>\n&gt; worth it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So. Sometimes a minor speedup is good enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Quicken is very definitely a combat buff. And fairly high mana. Grouped,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d put it on my main tank and let a bard handle the speedup for the<br/>\n&gt; rest, preferring to use mana for crowd control, or other circumstances<br/>\n&gt; rather than keeping everyone Quickened.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just because it is better does not mean that it is always the best<br/>\n&gt; use of the enchanter&#39;s mana.

Increases the amount of times<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt;will hit in a round against an enemy. In large/long battles it can make a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;huge difference. Quite deadly when used in conjunction with Languid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Pace/Tepid Deeds. Combine these 2 spells when possible.. talk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about breaking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the odds. Slows down your opponent, increases your attack rate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This spell doesn&#39;t stack with Augmentation, but as such it provides over<br/>\n&gt; &gt;double the attack speed for the target and is usually preferred anyway.<br/>\nThe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other important thing is that this spell helps increase combat skill gain<br/>\n&gt; &gt;since you are making more skill rolls with your attack.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;----------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So, when SLTW &quot; provides over double the attack speed &quot; - it hardly<br/>\nmatters<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if VoV does a 35.271% increase or a 36.983% increase.  Enchanter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;speed buffs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are where it&#39;s at.  I use Warsong because my enchanter wont give me SLTW.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;She says she does not want me to die that quickly.
