How is pushing buttons repetitively<br/>\nfor hours and hours not twitchy?  The purpose of Harmony is not to provide<br/>\nsome AI that would somehow be superior to a player&#39;s decisions.  The purpose<br/>\nis to replace button mashing with a simple script.  The Skill a Bard Player<br/>\nneeds is to know what songs to play at what times.  Harmony would only be<br/>\nappropriate for those particular times when song selection is a no-brainer<br/>\nand changes infrequently (fighting the same type of mob in the same type of<br/>\nsituation over and over).  The addition of this feature, which should not be<br/>\na SKILL which has a rating or increases, would not require anyone to use it.<br/>\nIt would level the playing field.  It would help people with bad<br/>\nconnections, but it would not hurt people with good connections.  If you<br/>\nhave a fast connection and want to continue to mash buttons, you would still<br/>\nbe free to do so.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> \t&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5. No harmony skill.  There has to be some skill at playing the class.<br/>\n&gt; Playing a bard is not twitchy.  I weave 2 songs all the time despite 500ms<br/>\n&gt; ping.  Its not twitching to hit 2 keys about 6 seconds apart.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n\t&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   No thanks, there&#39;s some skills that a player just has to have.  This is<br/>\n&gt; akin to a caster knowing when he can cast in combat & not be interrupted,<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; knowing how long to wait before casting so not to magetaunt a critter off<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; fighter.<br/>\n\t&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
