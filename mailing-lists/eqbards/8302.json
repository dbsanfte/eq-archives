Now log back in using your ogre female. Find the stalker and <br/>\n&gt;turn the tables on them, i.e. follow them around, make suggestive <br/>\n&gt;statements, etc. This will surely frighten them off and give them an idea of <br/>\n&gt;how their actions affect others. Don&#39;t push it too far, i.e. harassment, <br/>\n&gt;just enough to make your point. You might even role play it a bit to make it <br/>\n&gt;fun. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh - &quot;Bhuku think you cute.
