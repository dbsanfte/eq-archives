Last night I made 300pp in under 3 hours.. and I wasn&#39;t paying<br/>\nattention to loot. Admittedly I am high leveler (group was 35-40, me<br/>\nbeing 40), but that proves that leveling DOES payoff. The higher level you<br/>\nare the more loot you earn, almost exponentially.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people really enjoy playing the merchant. I do sometimes, did it<br/>\nduring my teens as a smith. But these days, I enjoy getting exp AND great<br/>\nloot without hassling with how much people want to pay or whether they<br/>\nthink I should give my real price up front or give too high a price so<br/>\nthey can haggle down or always list a price or not list a price.. gets<br/>\ntiring. =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
