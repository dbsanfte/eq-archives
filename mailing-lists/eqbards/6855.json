I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think there are aviaks in Rathe Mountains.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 24, I was killing gargoyles in the ocean of tears, but depending on<br/>\nyour server that area could be pretty crowded right now.   You can definately<br/>\nsolo them at 24 though.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re starting to get into the dark days of soloing though, as monsters really<br/>\ntend to hit hard at this level, you don&#39;t do much damage, and you don&#39;t have the<br/>\ntwo big mid-range bard power/solo songs, Angstich&#39;s Appalling Screech and<br/>\nSolon&#39;s Song of the Sirens.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to solo, look to the aviaks and gargoyles.  If it were me though,<br/>\nI&#39;d head to Cazic Thule and try to join a group.  Great exp, really fantastic<br/>\nloot and lots of action.  Groups there like having bards too, as lullaby and<br/>\nhymn are very potent there.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
