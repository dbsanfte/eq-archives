In my other incarnation, on Povar, I<br/>\naided a 10th level warrior or ranger in finding his body that had lots of<br/>\nmoney and armour on it.  In the process, I died once, and needed his help<br/>\nto protect me.  By the time we did finally arrive at his corpse intact, he<br/>\nwas grateful and paid me 1 plat, 5 gold (He could afford that easily).  I<br/>\ngratefully took it, as I had been saving for some armour of my own.  He<br/>\nthen asked if I could help his friend out, and I did, and made another 5<br/>\ngold.  It was the fun of helping them out that I enjoyed (though of course<br/>\nI did go back to the leather worker and buy some pants!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor newbies, I just help them out, remembering that I too stumbled across<br/>\nthe orc camp when I was trying to find my way around Greater Faydark.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Kendrin<br/>\n(Tunare)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
