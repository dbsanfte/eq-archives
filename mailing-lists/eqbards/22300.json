[&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;] <br/>\nSent: Friday, November 03, 2000 6:31 AM <br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39; <br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Has anyone else used these recently and noticed? <br/>\nWell, I did my usual ritual last night and pulled out Lullaby and Pixie <br/>\nStrike to see what unannounced changes might have occurred. It was prompted <br/>\nafter I used Pixie a few nights ago on some irritating casters. Here is <br/>\nwhat I found (*boggle* at will). <br/>\nNeither Lullaby or Pixie Strike gave a secondary resist message in over 200 <br/>\napplications of each. I tested Lullaby in the usual way versus some lvl 1 <br/>\nnewbie mobs in Misty Thicket this time. My resists for Lullaby were in the <br/>\nrange of 35%. Pixie Strike also showed no secondary resists and the overall <br/>\nresist level for Pixie Strike against level 1 mobs was 7%! <br/>\nOkay, now for some analysis. I figure one of three things has happened <br/>\nhere. <br/>\n1. Secondary resists have been removed and basic resist chance modified to <br/>\ncompensate. <br/>\n2. Secondary resists have had their message component removed so it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhit you in <br/>\nthe face how high the secondary resist is. <br/>\n3. Secondary resists are now correctly only occurring on mobs above a <br/>\ncertain level (originally claimed by GZ directly to be 35th). <br/>\nFrom what I observed, the resist rate on Lullaby was too high to simply be a<br/>\n<br/>\ncase of the secondary resist being removed on mobs under a certain level. <br/>\nOn the other hand, the resist rate I saw for Pixie Strike showed little <br/>\npossibility that the secondary resist could still be there as it was before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI Pixie Strike&#39;d myself 50 times and never saw a secondary resist message so<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel 32 isn&#39;t the point at which it starts if that&#39;s the issue. I did <br/>\nresist Pixie Strike 50% of the time however with an MR of 42 which seems <br/>\nhigh. <br/>\nOverall I think I&#39;m leaning towards the possibility that the secondary <br/>\nresist is either gone from both and the primary resist rate adjusted <br/>\naccordingly, or that the change has already gone in to reduce the secondary <br/>\non Pixie while at the same time removing the secondary message and just <br/>\ngiving one resist or not based on the two resist chances. <br/>\nthoughts? <br/>\nKitasi <br/>\n-------------------------- eGroups Sponsor -------------------------~-~&gt; <br/>\nCreate your business web site your way now at Bigstep.com. <br/>\nIt&#39;s the fast, easy way to get online, to promote your business, <br/>\nand to sell your products and services.
