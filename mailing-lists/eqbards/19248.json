[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 02, 2000 9:25 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Patch effects (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was the stated reason for the patch, but I found that either it had<br/>\nquite the opposite effect, or by coincidence there were far more connection<br/>\nproblems last nite than I have ever seen in 14+ months of play.  I haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen disconnected more than once on any given night since I got my cable<br/>\nmodem 6 months or so ago.  Last night I was disconnected 12 times.  On about<br/>\nhalf those occasions I was disconnected and left at the &quot;You have been<br/>\ndisconnected&quot; screen while EQ locked up the computer forcing a hard reboot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was apparently not alone in my difficulties.  A /who in Lake of Ill Omen<br/>\nshowed 60 characters present, but 23 of them were LinkDead.  I have never<br/>\nseen so many LinkDead characters in one zone before.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid anyone else have troubles?  Was there perhaps some other network issue<br/>\nat work or was this caused by the patch?  If it wasn&#39;t caused by external<br/>\nsources and isn&#39;t fixed I guess its back to Asheron&#39;s Call for me, as the<br/>\ngame was totally unplayable last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Kit<br/>\n      Somewhere in Warsliks Woods, only wish I knew where<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The servers were down for an emergency patch today.<br/>\n&gt;Coincidence? Someone want to see if this still works?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The servers went down yesterday to fix problems with sound that were causing<br/>\npeople to crash and lock up randomly.  Last night was the first time in four<br/>\nmonths that I was able to play the game with sound for more than 5 minutes<br/>\nbefore I had to reboot my computer.<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4821/10/_/451022/_/959956193/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4821/10/_/451022/_/959956193/</a>&gt; <br/>\n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adimg.egroups.com/img/4821/10/_/451022/_/959956193/\">http://adimg.egroups.com/img/4821/10/_/451022/_/959956193/</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
