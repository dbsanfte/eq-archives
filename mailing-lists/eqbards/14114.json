I think of you all as friends<br/>\n&gt;and could really use some advice.  Its not bard related (well there was a<br/>\n&gt;bard there!) but I could really use some input...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night....  Got invited to a Plane of Sky trip - my<br/>\n&gt;first trip to the planes.  It was not a guild trip but a bunch of people<br/>\n&gt;just going.  Everything went surprisingly well - we had 4 groups and few<br/>\n&gt;deaths considering we had never fought together before.  We cleared out<br/>\n&gt;everything and were on the last kill of the night, the Heart Harpie I think<br/>\n&gt;it is.  The group I was in actually got the kill (2 druid, me (shaman) and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;paladin if you can believe that).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well we all sit down to med, and the rest of the group is<br/>\n&gt;OOC-ing for us to &quot;shout out the loot&quot;.  I hardly ever loot so I was<br/>\n&gt;expecting someone else (i.e. my group leader) to do this.  Well nobody in<br/>\n&gt;our group did right away - I don&#39;t think.  The rest of the group kept<br/>\n&gt;shouting to tell them the loot was so I finally got up and looted the<br/>\n&gt;corpse.  All that was on it was an animal figurine - basically nothing.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;this was supposed to have the big loot of the night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Immediately, several of the people started making loot<br/>\n&gt;stealing accusations.  And these were not calm and collected but ranting<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;raving of the type I haven&#39;t seen since 8th grade.  It was frankly quite<br/>\n&gt;awful.  I don&#39;t know many of these people well so I can see where they<br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;have proof of my honesty but the extent to which they carried on and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>accused<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;was unbelievable.   The fact that seemed to condemn me the most was that it<br/>\n&gt;took &quot;too long&quot; (i.e. 1 minute) for me to announce the loot...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have no way of knowing if I was the first to loot the<br/>\n&gt;corpse or not.  So perhaps there was something on it that someone else in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;group stole - but I honestly doubt it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So my question is this... what do I do?  I know in the<br/>\n&gt;future I&#39;m not looting a thing and that we should have had more clear rules<br/>\n&gt;set up.  Does this happen on other servers?
