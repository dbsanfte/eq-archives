First thing<br/>\nI did was a /who to see how many people were in the zone.  Not surprisingly,<br/>\nthere were only 16 people in there.  Most of these people were in their 20s<br/>\nand low 30s.  Prior to the patch there would usually be 30+ people despite<br/>\nit being late at night with several of them in their high 30s- low 40s.<br/>\nMost likely explanation is that with no more rubicite the high levels didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave a reason to be there anymore.  This turned out to be pretty good<br/>\nbecause the entire time I was there not one train was started.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were also a lot of bards and rogues in Cazic as well.  Someone<br/>\nconfirmed that the Mudwater Rune is No Drop like most of the other bard<br/>\narmor quest components.  I was told the lizard fanatic that drops it spawns<br/>\nin the temple.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that didn&#39;t change though was killstealing.  A group with a couple<br/>\nof rogues in it were camping one of the spawns that now drops rogue armor.<br/>\nThey had been there over 5 hours trying to get the armor.  While they were<br/>\nwaiting, a 48 magician came into the room.  Sure enough the spawn appeared<br/>\nshortly and the 48 magician KS&#39;d it and got a piece of rogue armor.  To add<br/>\ninsult to injury, he immediately started auctioning it.  I guess even with<br/>\nthe new anti-KS patch, the magician was still able to do more damage than<br/>\nthe group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
