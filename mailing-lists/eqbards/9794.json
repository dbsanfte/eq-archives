It took her<br/>\nawhile though and definately for awhile I did not get them (i.e.<br/>\neveryone shouting yahoo! I got a shroom and i had never gotten 1 at<br/>\nall)  now with my forage well over the master level I get them all the<br/>\ntime.  I would say that its about in the 130&#39;s or so...i don&#39;t know<br/>\nspecifically but I get them all the time now along with the usual<br/>\nforaged items.  If you are not getting them as a bard I would say that<br/>\nyou may not get them.  My bard has yet to get anything weird adn she is<br/>\nwood elf..My suggestion is to yell out in the zone for them if you want<br/>\nspecial foods...us rangers and druids end up getting rid of them as<br/>\nthere is just too wide a variety and we usually have an over abundance<br/>\nof food.  The other thought i have to add here is that like tracking<br/>\nfor druids...its a special skill.  we get it at a level and it never<br/>\nadvances..it caps at 20 and when we get it that is the skill we get it<br/>\nat.  Is it possible that bards get forage and its at skill lvl 40 when<br/>\nwe get it.  Just a thought...  oh yeah and skill cap for druids is 200<br/>\ni believe<br/>\n<br/>\nChisarra de&#39;Danaan bard 8th song<br/>\nCrysarra Windblade druid 29th season<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Christine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christine@...\">christine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I believe there is a skill-check involved in foraging the new special<br/>\n&gt; food<br/>\n&gt; (like crocodile eggs, mushrooms, sea salt, sylvian berries, glowing<br/>\n&gt; lich,<br/>\n&gt; etc), but I&#39;m trying to figure out what it is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I have a few questions:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Bards max at 40 foraging, right?<br/>\n&gt; 2. At what level do you usually reach 40 skill foraging?<br/>\n&gt; 3. Have any of you bards managed to forage something other than<br/>\n&gt; berries,<br/>\n&gt; fruit, rabbit meat, roots, veggies and water? And at what skill level<br/>\n&gt; did<br/>\n&gt; you get it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone know about druids? (Like, if you have a druid, what is his<br/>\n&gt; skill cap<br/>\n&gt; and has he found any of the items, etc)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Daleia<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\n&gt; the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
