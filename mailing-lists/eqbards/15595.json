However, at the end of the night, the gm<br/>\nfinally asked that I write her an email explaining the situation.  Hopefully<br/>\nthat will help matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe character who actually stole it was Razel, although he said it was his<br/>\n&quot;friend&quot; Bonewalker who was playing Razel and stole the items.  I am told<br/>\nthat Razel is actually a good guy and was taken advantage of as well but I<br/>\njust don&#39;t know what to believe.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe funniest part of the story is that Razel actually gave a friend of mine<br/>\nall his druid items for me to hold as collateral.  However, when my friend<br/>\ntried to trade them to me, one of the items was a full LIght Burlap Sack<br/>\n(which is lore).  When we hit trade, the items in the bag and the bag itself<br/>\npoofed.  And of course the gms won&#39;t believe this either - they say my<br/>\nfriend kept the items but I know he did not.    So, now I will have to<br/>\nreplace all this guys items as well.  I&#39;m told that there is a fairly well<br/>\nknown bug with lore containers poofing but I did not have any knowledge of<br/>\nthat before...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thanks for the support friends :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTani/Hally<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Roach [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 02, 2000 9:52 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] &lt;-------idiot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed, report this now and don&#39;t stop until you get an answer.
