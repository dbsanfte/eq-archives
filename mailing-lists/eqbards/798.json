I asked, and was informed <br/>\n&gt; by the<br/>\n&gt; development team, throughout all of beta. It&#39;s pretty acurate.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do not believe it is acurate!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor 1st level characters to advance to 2nd here is a listing of <br/>\nclasses in experience order, lowest to highest. This is easy to test <br/>\nfor yourself, start a 1st level Warrior and count the number of <br/>\nsnakes it takes to get to 2nd, then do the same thing with a Bard <br/>\nof the same race.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Warrior, Rogue, Wisdom based characters all equally lowest.<br/>\n2. Int based Characters approx 10% more kills needed to advance <br/>\nto 2nd<br/>\n3. Monks 20% more kills<br/>\n4.  Ranger/Bard/Paladin/Shadowknight approx 30% more kills<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for different races requiring more xp, I have not seen any <br/>\nevidence that this is true. I know the 1st to 2nd level test have been <br/>\ntried on Enchanters of different races and they all required the <br/>\nsame xp to advance to 2nd level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont beleive that Bards of different races require different amounts <br/>\nof xp to advance in levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I would love for somebody to test and prove me wrong  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nT.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTony Walsh, Video Coding Group<br/>\nTeltec Ireland, DCU, Dublin 9, Ireland<br/>\nTel     : +353-1-7045477<br/>\nFAX     : +353-1-7045092<br/>\nE-mail  : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:walsht@...\">walsht@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
