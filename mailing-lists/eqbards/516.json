I assume that you put your first point<br/>\nin Stringed when it became available at level 8. Exceptions to this that I<br/>\nknow of are the languages, which seem to always start at 1 regardless of<br/>\nlevel, and Dual Wield, which appears to start at double your level.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 04, 1999 9:41 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Off-topic: Expending practice points<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA general question about expending practice points:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got to 8th level I expended one practice point to train in String.<br/>\nThe first time I sang a song that used a stringed instrument, my skill<br/>\nraised one point to 9.  That indicates that expending the initial practice<br/>\npoint to get the String skill gave me a skill level of 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, when I first started my character I expended one practice<br/>\npoint in Sense Heading.  The next time I went up a level in Sense Heading,<br/>\nmy skill level was only 2.  That indicated one practice point spent and one<br/>\nskill level gained.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, does expending a practice point give you a random amount of skill levels<br/>\nbased on your INT and/or WIS score or does it only give you one skill level<br/>\nper practice point?  If the second case is true, how do you account for me<br/>\ngetting 8 skill points in String while only expending 1 practice point?<br/>\n<br/>\nReason for asking:  I am about to embark on a secondary career as the<br/>\nKelethin brewmaster for E&#39;ci.  I haven&#39;t expended any practice points in<br/>\nbrewing yet.  I want to get my skill up to 10 before I start the learning<br/>\nprocess.  Just need to know if I only need to put a couple of practice<br/>\npoints in it or will I need to expend 10 practice points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJoin the Star Wars craze!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nSet up your Star Wars list at ONElist.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
