I<br/>\n&gt; finally asked a fellow bard about it and he told me you have <br/>\n&gt; to train it<br/>\n&gt; with Caskin Marseheart upstairs in the Freeport&#39;s Bard Guild.<br/>\n&gt; Well I went to him and it still wasnt there. Am I dense or <br/>\n&gt; something and<br/>\n&gt; skip by it in the list? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What level are you?  I assume since you are talking about the mana song, you<br/>\nare level 32+.  All i was thinking was that you are not level 26 yet, when i<br/>\nbelieve it shows up as a skill on Carskin.  Or perhaps they made it<br/>\navailable at a later level, hard to explain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; On another subject, I&#39;m wondering what the best strategy for using the<br/>\n&gt; mana song is.<br/>\n&gt; Should I even play it at all during combat? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is a bug that a spell cast while you are playing the mana song can use<br/>\na whole lot more mana than usual (one whole bubble of mana on a spell that<br/>\nnormally takes one quarter or less).  Therefore it is not a good idea to<br/>\nplay the mana song during combat, unless the special case you mentioned when<br/>\nall casters are OOM.  otherwise during combat it can actually be<br/>\ndetrimental.<br/>\n<br/>\nas far as the decision to play heal or mana song, i find the same thing,<br/>\nthat everyone wants the mana song instead of heal, because your healer&#39;s<br/>\nmeditate combined with the mana song allows them to heal the group faster<br/>\nthan your healing song.  if you are in a group with no healers, you got<br/>\nbigger problems hehe.  and as far as entering a fight without everyone being<br/>\nfull health, i think this is a group decision problem, not because you<br/>\nhappen to be singing mana instead of heal.  while i do think it is more<br/>\nimportant for all your casters to be FM than the group being full health,<br/>\nits just smart to have both.<br/>\n<br/>\ni think shoulda read this i doubt i made any sense =P<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Silverleaf, Level 46 Bard, Mithaniel Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
