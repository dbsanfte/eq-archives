Heck<br/>\nare spellist is even incomplete Verant admitted this. Half the spells are<br/>\nupgrades or lower level version of spells that weren&#39;t in game or that were<br/>\nsupposed to be in game. Besides if you really want to get cynical then fine<br/>\nlets do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNecro Nerfs<br/>\n<br/>\n- First pet nerf<br/>\n- Lich nerf ( way way back before most were 50 )<br/>\n- Lifetap nerf<br/>\n- dot nerf<br/>\n- feign nerf<br/>\n- pet nerf number 2<br/>\n- Pact of the shadow nerf<br/>\n<br/>\nUseful Enhancements<br/>\n<br/>\n- Mes<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other new spells aren&#39;t in yet but they have been working on these for<br/>\nawhile obviously to make necros more group friendly. The dot I&#39;m unsure of<br/>\nbecause word from test from 50 necros are saying that it is resisted more<br/>\nthen the 49th darkness mob which means it probably sucks. Debuff is nice but<br/>\nonly useful for groups. The mana pact should be interesting but I think it<br/>\nwill mainly be used to cut down on Corpse Retrieval. As for the others they<br/>\nare just lower level versions of spells we get already.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To be completely cynical for a minute, I&#39;d argue that the only way to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; get results from Verant is to be a whiny brat. At least that&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; impression I&#39;m getting from the recent necro nerf. Can you name one<br/>\n&gt;&gt; other class that Verant has taken something away from then give 6 new<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spells or abilities to to compensate? No one could possibly claim that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the necros presented their case in an adult manner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Want To Be Showered With Kisses?<br/>\n&gt;Visit eGroups Valentine Gift Guide<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine9\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine9</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
