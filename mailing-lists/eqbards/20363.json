The big difference, melee","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1364475660\">Dual wield is ok, but it&#39;s not earth shattering, esp now, as Draelon said,<br/>\nthat the 2hb weapons have started to get decent stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big difference, melee wise, is that we get 5 skill points per level in<br/>\nour weapon skills (I misspoke myself earlier, you are correct it&#39;s melee<br/>\nweapon skills that are different, not offense/defense)  whereas they get<br/>\nonly 4.  Which means that, in the long run, we will hit more often than<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to why your cleric isn&#39;t hitting very hard that is due to the fact that<br/>\nhe is only level 24 and his weapon skill is probably still below 100 (24*4<br/>\nis only 96) and you do not get dmg bonuses until after 100 weapon skill (or<br/>\nso I&#39;ve observed, that&#39;s not a hard fast 100% for sure thing but I&#39;m about<br/>\n80-90% sure of that).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, bottom line:  Our melee skills are, and always have been, only<br/>\nmarginally better than that of a pure caster.  Our songs always have been,<br/>\nand always will be (barring any major changes), far superior in dmg output,<br/>\nand prevention, if used properly with instruments after level 18 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree with those that have posted that until the kunark release we<br/>\nhad more Melee POWER than pure casters due to the fact that 1hs weapons were<br/>\nso out of balance with 2h weapons for various reasons but our melee SKILL<br/>\nwas always only slightly better.<br/>\n<br/>\nDual Wield nowadays really isn&#39;t all that huge an advantage over 2h weapons<br/>\n(if you&#39;re luggin kunark stuff around anyway).  Dual Wield plus Double<br/>\nAttack is superior to 2h weapons but since we don&#39;t get double attack that&#39;s<br/>\na moot point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still chuckle when I remember a post by someone a while back who thinks he<br/>\ncan out dmg a shadowknight in straight melee with no spells.  That&#39;s<br/>\nsomething I&#39;d LOVE to see, especially since they fixed the disparity between<br/>\n1h and 2h weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, you&#39;re absolutely right, our weapon skills are better than<br/>\ntheirs (slightly) otherwise we&#39;re pretty much the same.  And our dodge is<br/>\nonly slightly higher.  At much higher levels the gap widens when we hit 53<br/>\n(lol like many of us are gonna see 53 ;) and again at 56.  (Parry and<br/>\nRiposte).  I personally doubt I will ever see 53 or 56... my time in EQ is<br/>\ndwindling.  I dunno if I&#39;ll even reach 50 for Lyrnia (currently 45 and 2<br/>\nbubbles).  And Lyrnali (my 51 bard on Test) has already been deleted in<br/>\ndisgust over the whole Test fiasco.<br/>\n<br/>\nUhh jeez where&#39;d I go with this?
