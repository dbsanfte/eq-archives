They feel a lot of fun comes from<br/>\ndiscovering these things yourself and in a way i agree. Except that a TON<br/>\nof things in eq are broken like quests, songs, spells, etc so you dont know<br/>\nif you just have yet to figure out what the song does or if indeed it is<br/>\nbroken. This is ridicoulsly frustrating and absolutely inexcusable. Making<br/>\npeople waste DAYS only to find out something is not working is absolutely<br/>\nhorrible and right now this is by far my biggest problem with the game. If<br/>\nthey posted a bug list of things known to not be working that would answer<br/>\nmost of my complaints. I dont mind trying to find out what stuff does, but<br/>\ni dont even bother anymore cause most of the time its just broken. That imo<br/>\ntakes all of the fun out of it. And i havent done a single quest yet unless<br/>\ni read a complete spoiler documenting it works, cause otherwise its<br/>\nGUARANTEED to be broken. Now how horrible is that? :(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
