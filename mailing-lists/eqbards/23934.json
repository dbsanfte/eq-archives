I hate having a song I never use, so I am hoping<br/>\npeople dispell my thoughts on it...  As it is, I am having trouble thinking<br/>\nof a situation where I would use it.  Without the dam shield, I would use it<br/>\nall the time (I often feel it is my job to mitigate damage more than help<br/>\nthe group deal it, since there are many more damage dealing classes out<br/>\nthere).  I can&#39;t think of a scenario where I would use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the same way about Song of Dawn, I can&#39;t remember the last I died due<br/>\nto bard hate.  Pretty much when I die, its because we couldn&#39;t get a mob off<br/>\nthe enchanter or cleric.  But that is a discussion for next month...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
