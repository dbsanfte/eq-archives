An old druid friend of mine always <br/>\ncomes upon rare to semi-rare spawns (damn druids), and he just impules kites <br/>\nthem, even if he has no hope of killing them. He kited Broog Bloodbeard for <br/>\n30 minutes while he called us for help. =P<br/>\nAnyways, he saw Equestrielle and tried to kite it. He got smacked down prety <br/>\nhard, and we went over to res him. Before we reached his corpse I caught <br/>\nEquestrielle on track, and we killed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t used the Purge ability, but I&#39;m guessing it probably works like <br/>\npillage enchantment. Or maybe it pillages just harmful effects *shrug*, <br/>\nsimilar to the Cleanse effect of the Shining Star of Light. Thank you for <br/>\nposting about this. I never tried any tests with it, and did not know it <br/>\nslightly enhanced pixie strike. This tells me that the instrument SHOULD be <br/>\nuseful for our expansion song 53 (Song of Twilight). Hopefully, it will <br/>\nfurther reduce MR over what a store bought flute could do. We&#39;ll see what <br/>\nhappens.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad&lt;Legion&gt;<br/>\n50th Bard of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Robert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:merlin26@...\">merlin26@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Unicorn Horn<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 21 Apr 2000 12:53:39 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Greetings,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The other day My 45th bard was grouped with a wiz old friend. He said he <br/>\n&gt;ran<br/>\n&gt;into some unicorn and killed it a while back and that he got a &quot;unicorn<br/>\n&gt;horn&quot;  but didnt know if it was special or not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I told him give it to me ill do a quick test ( we were in lower guk so <br/>\n&gt;didnt<br/>\n&gt;want to waste To much time).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well first I fired up Invis with it and it was a wind instrament. So then I<br/>\n&gt;pixie striked my self 3 times to watch the MR lower.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. No instrament my mr loweres 8<br/>\n&gt;2. Normal Wood Flute my mr lowers14 points<br/>\n&gt;3. Unicorn horn my mr lowers 17 points ( average like 22% increase or<br/>\n&gt;someting )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also have a 50th necro and been bored with the game a bit . But my<br/>\n&gt;question is, well no question. Is there anymore to this horn? I actually<br/>\n&gt;have never heard of it and those are all the tests I did with it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just want to know if anyone else knows anymore about this horn. Possible<br/>\n&gt;other uses for it and also what Purge spell is ( it has 5 charges)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also this has no hand graphic on me wood elf bard. It does do the Piper<br/>\n&gt;Animation though :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks ahead of time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tuldar Missednote 45th Wood Elf Bard.
