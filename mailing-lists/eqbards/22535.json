Computer generated monsters will never be as scary as the Ring<br/>\nWraiths were.  What are the chances whoever is playing Gandalf (anyone have<br/>\na cast list yet) is as much of a bastard as he was in the animated version?<br/>\nAnd somehow I can&#39;t see being Mini Me (I forgot his real name) being as<br/>\nappealing as Pippen was...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll see and again I hope I&#39;m wrong :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
