I tangled with him playing my monk. My GOD! His Harm Touch didn&#39;t do too much -- maybe a 2 bubbles of damage or less, but when he started punching me for 30+ CONSISTENTLY I got a bit worried. He dropped me to around 75 hp&#39;s and I had to Feign Death to keep him from killing me. What a CROCK of poo!  Eventually, I got my health back and beat the snot out of him, but I had to get major buffed from a cleric and shaman.  SHEESH! You&#39;d think I was fighting Vox herself.
