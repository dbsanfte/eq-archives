Spent<br/>\n&gt; four hours in Sol A last night in a party and killed a ton of<br/>\n&gt; blue goblins.<br/>\n&gt; I got maybe 3/4 bar of EXP.  The camp was safe but actually pretty boring.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m willing to take a risk soloing if it will help me get out of<br/>\n&gt; 35th.   I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; thinking about the only place for me to solo at 35 is Rathe Mtns charming<br/>\n&gt; giants against one another.  Anyone got a better suggestion.<br/>\n&gt; Would it just<br/>\n&gt; be better to join a group in one of the dungeons or kill ogre bouncers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
