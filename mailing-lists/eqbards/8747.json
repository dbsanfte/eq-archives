There is a practice <br/>\nresearch item that allows finger wigglers to build up their research without <br/>\nwasting rare research componets.  And one of the practice runes requires a <br/>\nBurned out lightstone.  So most likely he was handing the person with the <br/>\nburned out lightstone the practice research book with all the components in <br/>\nit (except for the BO lightstone).  The person with the lightstone places it <br/>\nin the container and hits combine(no research skill it needed for this part) <br/>\nthen hands the rune and container back to buyer. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Knight &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Knight@...\">Knight@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Burned out Lighstones, Quest? was Re: Elf Hide <br/>\n&gt;Gloves<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 08 Oct 1999 02:04:28 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello Fellow Bards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Don&#39;t you think that the Burned Out Lightstones are NO DROP<br/>\n&gt;like any other NO DROP Items that are Quest related? Although<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t know and I&#39;m not sure, I think there is a Quest for them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While traveling at full speed in West Common somebody was<br/>\n&gt;buying the Burned out lightstones... Yes BUYING... He said<br/>\n&gt;that he knew they were NO DROP but said there was a way to<br/>\n&gt;transfer them anyway. So why would a guy go thru all that trouble<br/>\n&gt;for useless items? Anyone have an idea?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To say that all those Lightstones messages started with my Elf Hide<br/>\n&gt;Gloves question where I used the Wisp as an example ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Anonymous Bard with the 20th song. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
