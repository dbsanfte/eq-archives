In my mid 20s, I died quite a bit due to<br/>\n&quot;bard hate&quot;.  Since I made 30th level, it hasn&#39;t been nearly the problem<br/>\nlike it was before.  I&#39;m finding that the damage the tanks and casters are<br/>\ninflicting outweighs the taunt effect of my songs.  As a result, I&#39;m now<br/>\nending combats nearly at full health.  I&#39;ve even resorted to keeping the<br/>\nheal song up several pulses to try and spread out the damage.  I died three<br/>\ntimes in 30th level but that was mainly my fault.  Didn&#39;t die once during<br/>\n31st level (first time in a long time I&#39;ve gone an entire level without<br/>\ndying at least once) and so far I&#39;m halfway thru 32d and still haven&#39;t died.<br/>\nTo say the least, EQ has been a lot more fun lately:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n32 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; It&#39;s pretty bad at your level (teens to low 20s).  It gets<br/>\n&gt; better in the mid 20s to 30s.  It was almost completely gone<br/>\n&gt; (for me) in my 30s, then started coming back in the 40s.  I<br/>\n&gt; suspect that&#39;s because by level 40 all the tanks have capped<br/>\n&gt; their taunt and combat skills, whereas our songs keep getting<br/>\n&gt; better.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
