The Bank in High Hold (HH) is down stairs.  Yes it is dangerous down there, <br/>\njust don&#39;t open any doors.  The Bank is just around the corner (right?) from the<br/>\nbottom of a set of stairs.  I only stayed a short time (too low level) so I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if there are more then one set of stairs but if you don&#39;t see it <br/>\nright away leave.   I like the way everyone is armed in HH.    The bank teller <br/>\nwas dual wielding.  Who needs guards.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  What&#39;s up with Farie Dragons?  The little guys with butterfly wings.  Are <br/>\nthey monsters to hunt?  Do they have a bad faction adjustment when killed.  Do <br/>\nthey have good treasure?  No one seems to be hunting them.  Yes they&#39;re <br/>\nbeautiful but that doesn&#39;t seem to stop most people.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Thanks for the info on combine weapons.  I had forgotten they were magical. <br/>\nUnfortunately if I had the money to buy one I wouldent need to hunt wisps...  <br/>\nsigh.  Just have to take my chances with &#39;chords&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  IMHO  Yes you can stack/juggle songs.  Works great most times.  Key tactic.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  I&#39;m puzzled by these complaints about our songs.  If you look at at the <br/>\nspell lists for the magic classes most of their higher spells are simply better <br/>\nversions of their earlier spells.  Why wouldent we also get better songs as we <br/>\nget higher?  Also I use almost all of my songs.  Some more then others of course<br/>\nbut they all have there uses.  (True I&#39;m only 11th level) I used 9 of the 10 <br/>\navailable song this weekend! (not counting the broken one) I love the <br/>\nflexibility of being a bard.  When in N. Ro I got a constant stream of offers to<br/>\njoin groups.  I felt bad turning everyone down.  So far being a bard rocks!  I <br/>\njust hope it doesn&#39;t turn sour later on.  I don&#39;t really expect it to be a <br/>\nproblem.  Not even being a power gamer (life, girlfriend, job, friends etc.) by <br/>\nthe time I reach, gasp, 25th level everyone else will be on their second or <br/>\nthird life and probably much mellower about things.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  Speaking of the group I did join.  It had a Dark elf as a member.  When I <br/>\nsang Anthem do Arms his strength fell by 10!  Is this intentional? Do Dark Elves<br/>\nhate music?  (grin) Probably a bug but has anyone else noticed this?   Ironic, <br/>\nthat group, 2 trolls and a dark elf, were extremely fun and fair with other <br/>\ngroups while the Elves and Clerics I tried to share with in the Faydark were all<br/>\nextremely obnoxious.  Go figure. <br/>\n<br/>\nBujold the singing bard<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
