Ranger tracked to him and we were right on top of him.  I somehow<br/>\ngot one glimpse of him before he slipped under the world and targeted him.<br/>\nI could bellow him down to ´┐¢ health but he would heal him self back.  I<br/>\ncould not out dmg him and gave up after 30 minutes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow - he was stuck &quot;under the world&quot; but he could fight me and cast on me<br/>\nand melee me too.  Dragging enraged dreads to the zone and them getting<br/>\nstuck under the world there could be really ugly - zone in get attacked hard<br/>\nby stuff you cant see - ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some places, Verant has code for stuff going &quot;under the world&quot;  - you can<br/>\nsee this if you use any of the &quot;short cuts&quot; - the message says that the<br/>\nsystem detects you under the world and moves you to a &quot;safe spot.&quot;<br/>\nHopefully, they track mobs the same way and they get moved to the &quot;safe<br/>\nspot.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - if you die a weird death in South Karana - and suspect some thing<br/>\nstrange has happened or you saw a &quot;you fell off the world&quot; message.  The<br/>\n&quot;safe spot&quot; is about 500 meters on a diagnol to the right (southwest) of the<br/>\nstone bridge as you face to the south or into the zone.  Of course, you are<br/>\na bard and your loc song will find you but you will be very suspicious<br/>\nbecause it will find you in a very different spot from where you (or the<br/>\nadventurer you are helping) thinks you (he) died.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tFriday, November 05, 1999 8:56 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Kith Nerfed!!!
