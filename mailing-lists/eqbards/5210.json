I used to get<br/>\n75% failures till I maxed wind, then got about 5-10% until about 2 weeks ago<br/>\nwhen it increased to 25%.  I tried it 50 times with wind at 13, suceeded 14<br/>\ntimes.  Tried 50 times with 75 skill, suceeded 46 times, tried last nite 50<br/>\ntimes at 83 skill, suceeded 41 times.  Also my dex and wisdom are both 5<br/>\npoints higher than they were at 75 skill and my char is still at 121.  And<br/>\nto think I originally did this just to see how much effect music skill<br/>\nreally had on missed notes.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Snicker Furfoot, Esq.

But I do have at least a 50% failure rate on<br/>\nit, even at 15th.   Anyone else notice the Charisma song being tough to<br/>\nstart?  The Lullaby (which I just got) starts normally, even if it is<br/>\nresisted 50% of the time *chuckles*<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\nprograms, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
