Ok, so its hard to know what spells are out there, but<br/>\nwhen you do find out at least you know right away what the spell does<br/>\nwithout logging out to go to some website to download a list of what your<br/>\nspells do at the new level.

I too am enjoying it a lot.  I also<br/>\nplayed Rolemaster to death. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the skill/attribute system.  It makes sense.  I like, contrary to<br/>\nwhat some people have said, the way your character looks.  I like the fact<br/>\nthat everyone doesn&#39;t look exactly the same, depending on class.  Piecemeal<br/>\narmor doesn&#39;t look as nearly as stupid as it does in EQ, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only complaint is the disk thrashing as you walk through the land (which<br/>\nlooks 10000x better than EQ&#39;s &quot;landscape&quot;, IMO.)  I don&#39;t have a slow<br/>\ncomputer by any means (400mhz Cel, 256M ram, decently fast HD it&#39;s on,<br/>\netc..) but the pausing when it accesses the disk is annoying.  There should<br/>\nbe a way to have it retain textures and such in RAM when you&#39;ve got a ton of<br/>\nit.  Unless I just don&#39;t know about some way to fix that.. (checking AC<br/>\nwebsites....)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, like you, I will be keeping my EQ account active for the time<br/>\nbeing.  Don&#39;t know how long that will be.  I hadn&#39;t played since last<br/>\nFriday, log on today, go LD within 10 minutes.  Get back on, and all<br/>\ncerf-net servers are being shut down, so I have to log.  :)  Unfortunately,<br/>\nthere&#39;s a problem with characters not appearing when you login to AC right<br/>\nnow, or else I&#39;d be playing that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT- 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My server has been on the blink recently so I haven&#39;t been getting any<br/>\n&gt; eqbard emails.  Got a flood of them today now that its working finally.<br/>\n&gt; Thought I would comment on this topic as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My RL best friend bought AC and convinced me to buy it as well.  The price<br/>\n&gt; was only $25 at COMPUSA and you get a month free so I figured even if I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t like it I would get my money&#39;s worth.

I played Rolemaster a lot in<br/>\n&gt; college and the way the stats and skills work in AC are very similar.  And<br/>\n&gt; on the topic of stats and skills, they actually work.  When you increase<br/>\n </span></blockquote>any<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of these you get noticeable<br/>\n&gt; effects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The original poster covered most of the pros and cons so I won&#39;t go into<br/>\n&gt; those.  As it stands right now, I&#39;m going to keep my EQ account active for<br/>\n&gt; now but I think, in the near future, I will end up spending most of my<br/>\n </span></blockquote>time<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; playing AC.  Here are the key factors why:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1)  Get to play with my best friend online.<br/>\n&gt; 2)  AC is much better than EQ for casual gamers.  If you don&#39;t have but an<br/>\n&gt; hour or two to play, you can still log in and accomplish something.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Soloing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is a viable alternative, whether outside or in a dungeon.<br/>\n&gt; 3)  No overcrowding and therefore no fighting over spawns.<br/>\n&gt; 4)  Fast respawn rate.  In the places I&#39;ve been so far, the respawn rate<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; somewhere around 5 minutes.  Basically nonstop action no matter where you<br/>\n&gt; are at.<br/>\n&gt; 5)  No camping.  Loot is randomized based on the level of the mob you are<br/>\n&gt; fighting.<br/>\n&gt; 6)  No hell levels!!<br/>\n&gt; 7)  No EXP loss when dying.  Vitae penalty worked off gradually as you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>kill<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; more mobs.  Plus you keep almost all of your equipment when.<br/>\n&gt; 8)  Dungeon crawl mode of adventuring is the standard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So if these issues are more important to you than having a bank to store<br/>\n&gt; stuff, traditional fantasy classes/monsters, secure trading windows, and a<br/>\n&gt; better chat interface, then you might enjoy AC.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone decides to give it a try, look me up on the Morningthaw server.<br/>\n&gt; My character&#39;s name is Ott Numah.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Later<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nPERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
