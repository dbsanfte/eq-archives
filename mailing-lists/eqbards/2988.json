If so, don&#39;t you get stunned and have<br/>\nyour songs stopped?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr are you standing off with an instrument and playing for extra party<br/>\neffect?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note...<br/>\nI was in a real bad melee last night - me and my enchanter friend. An<br/>\nicey-boney skelly comes by and we attack it.  A snow lepoard and an Orc join<br/>\nthe melee.  The icey is about a bub more hp than either me or my friend and<br/>\nhe&#39;s hitting on me.  My friends hp drops a half a bub lower than mine. And<br/>\nwe are both real low.  So, I decided to gamble and equip my lute - I already<br/>\nam trying desparately to keep the song going between interupts.  The<br/>\nicey-boney keeps hitting on me and finally slays me.  My friend&#39;s pet killed<br/>\nthe lep and she killed the icey and mezzed the Orc and escapes with 4 hp<br/>\nleft.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it ever help to equip lute for hp if you are getting hit on by strong<br/>\nmobs?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 13th level<br/>\na.k.a.

From pressing the<br/>\n\t\tsong button to when the song effect kicks in is 3.5 seconds<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo in theory, you could twist:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\ttwist 4 songs and still have <br/>\n\t\t2 seconds to spare. :-)  Hmm, maybe I should put a metronome<br/>\n\t\tnext to my computer...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
