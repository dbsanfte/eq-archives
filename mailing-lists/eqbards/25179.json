If they don&#39;t see numbers on the screen, they don&#39;t think you<br/>\nare doing anything.  Also, seeing you with your drum (stick) and no weapons<br/>\n(no exaggereatedly huge sionaches or breathe of harmony), they think you are<br/>\nnot contributing.  So then you can tell them that your 3 chants do about<br/>\n1800 dmg per minute. And ya, 60 levels later, 210 days and still explaining<br/>\nto the groups: &quot;... my bard mana song *is* the same as Clarity-2, the &#39;you<br/>\nfeel smaller&#39; *adds* 35 AC to all of you, etc, etc.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
