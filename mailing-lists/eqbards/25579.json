If I remember <br/>\ncorrectly, I could start to handle one at around 8th or 9th level, but then <br/>\ncould grab 3 of them before I outgrew them around 14th or so. Good <br/>\nexperience, great loot (especially when combined with the gypsy quests in <br/>\nOasis or NK). In East Antonica the best place to nab them is in the Commons, <br/>\nparticularly EC. In the Western portion, the best place to hunt for wisps is <br/>\non that island as you head toward Erudin.<br/>\n       I remember cranking out around 400pp or more just from woprking the <br/>\nwisps. Not bad for under 20th level. In addition, Greater Light Stones were <br/>\nonly going for around 5 or 6pp on my server, so I bought all that I could <br/>\nwhen I took my trips to the gypsies. I made a nice profit, established some <br/>\nnice business contacts, and picked up some extra experience in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nEberwulf (Solusek Ro)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
