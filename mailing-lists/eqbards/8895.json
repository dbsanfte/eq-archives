(In addition to wanting the weapon - my guildmaster assigns quests to advance in rank in the guild - and this is mine!)<br/>\n<br/>\n    The first time we spent a good three hours and the giant never spawned.  I think we saw a &quot;red&#39; sand giant or two but I don&#39;t recall.  While I was running to the zone (from somewhere far - I forget where) a guildmate of mine was in South Ro - and saw the particular Sand Giant (conned yellow to him at the time) but by the time I and some others got there it was gone.  Never saw another one.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Last night - I got to the zone around 7:30 - 8:00 or so (CDT).  I just turned 25 - and I was with a 27 cleric.  We found the giant - attacked it - and we both got killed.  I am guessing this was around 8:00 - maybe a bit later.  I get back - and discover a 35th warrior grouped with another mid 30&#39;s caster (wizard?) killed it and got the plans.  We grouped with them and they waited a good 45 minutes or so - but then had to log.<br/>\n<br/>\n    A bunch of my guildmates came online and we waited until:15 AM - and not a single sand giant ever appeared...  We killed most of the &quot;wandering&quot; type of spawns. dune tarantulas, mummies, orc warriors, ghouls, zombies, desert madmen, and dark boned skeletons (the only which gives exp. - and most of them don&#39;t).  But never saw a single giant &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    As I was about to log off I developed a theory I wanted to bounce off the people here.  Perhaps the Sand Giants are &quot;linked&quot; to something we weren&#39;t killing.  In particular - perhaps the Dervish?  When I was lower level (teens? I think)  I spent a LOT of time in N Ro, and W Commons fighting Dervish.  There seemed to always be a lot of Giants around (particularly in N Ro, not quite so bad in West Commons).<br/>\n<br/>\n    When I first got on - the zone was more crowded and I think some people were camping the dervish camp.  Could this be coincidence?  Is it normal to go a good 5 hours and never see a &quot;randomly spawned&quot; Sand Giant - or on my next attempt should I be exterminating Dervishes even though I get no XP for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde (yes the few Dark Bones Skels got me 25 back)<br/>\n&lt;Order of Norrath&gt;<br/>\nXegony Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
