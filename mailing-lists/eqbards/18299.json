A good enchanter makes many of our tactics<br/>\nunusable.  I finally stuck on using hymn, warsong, and CoB after making it<br/>\nclear the enchanter should not buff people with Strengthen.  When our ranger<br/>\nwasn&#39;t there I used Chains in place of CoB.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for stacking, if CoB was up Strengthen would stick and CoB would still<br/>\nwork, but CoB would not stick after Strengthen.  Also, The Screaming Mace<br/>\neffect will not stick if you are singing CoB, but if Screaming Mace effect<br/>\ngoes off first, CoB will stack on top of it.
