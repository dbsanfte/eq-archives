To bring you up to date, I lucked into a Horn of Hsagra, doing a <br/>\nlow-level quest in Ak&#39;Anon (probably due to a loot-table mixup).  I offered <br/>\nit to a friend of mine who is in a guild, and he said to write my own <br/>\nticket.  So I did.  I requested the Lute of the Howler, and some coins for <br/>\nthe Nostrolo Tambourine quest.  I didn&#39;t expect to get all of that, but I <br/>\nwas hopeful.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I got a call, requesting my presence in West Commons.  There, I was <br/>\npresented, in trade for the Horn, a bag containing one Lute of the Howler, <br/>\n6 Ancient Coins, and 18 peridots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say I did well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
