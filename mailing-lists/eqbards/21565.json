I am in SK now<br/>\n&gt; and plan just to run over<br/>\n&gt; to Queynos and take a trip to Erudin while I am not<br/>\n&gt; in Kunark.  Also, thanks<br/>\n&gt; for sharing your kite areas.  I am just starting to<br/>\n&gt; do OT and find it works<br/>\n&gt; pretty well there, too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, my next question - just keeping the list active<br/>\n&gt; =).  I have some<br/>\n&gt; Lambent(Helm, gauntlets and bracer) and plan to get<br/>\n&gt; the rest.  Yeah, varied<br/>\n&gt; opinions on if it is the &quot;best&quot; armor for us, but I<br/>\n&gt; want to at least have<br/>\n&gt; the look for a while.  My query is on options on my<br/>\n&gt; other armor - cloak,<br/>\n&gt; rings, earrings, neck, face, etc.  I have a jagged<br/>\n&gt; band, a +7 Cha ring, a<br/>\n&gt; splintered bronze cloak, 2 oppoline Cha earrings and<br/>\n&gt; some + Cha necklace,<br/>\n&gt; Splitpaw maybe.  I have been lucky in FM and have<br/>\n&gt; used pp from my two loops<br/>\n&gt; to purchase a MM drum (800) and currently have my<br/>\n&gt; remaining stash (1300ish)<br/>\n&gt; burning a hole in my pocket.  I have most of the<br/>\n&gt; gems already for my<br/>\n&gt; Lambent, so I don&#39;t need to spend for them.  My<br/>\n&gt; weapons are Obsidian Shard,<br/>\n&gt; Pugius, Dragoon Dirk in range slot and I use Gnoll<br/>\n&gt; Hide whips to keep up 1HS<br/>\n&gt; and use for stunning casters.  Lately, I have been<br/>\n&gt; using the shard in my<br/>\n&gt; primary hand and the whip in my off hand - fun to<br/>\n&gt; burn and stun at the same<br/>\n&gt; time - that&#39;s when I use weapons at all as my melee<br/>\n&gt; does not compare(as we<br/>\n&gt; all know).  I really want to upgrade my cloak and<br/>\n&gt; maybe my neck, but if you<br/>\n&gt; have other suggestions for my other slots, please<br/>\n&gt; share them with me(face<br/>\n&gt; WILL be the mask one day).  Include your opinion of<br/>\n&gt; ball park value(I know<br/>\n&gt; it varies server to server) and where I could find<br/>\n&gt; it if I just traveled<br/>\n&gt; there(assuming I can camp there or maybe I can do it<br/>\n&gt; in my future) and any<br/>\n&gt; stats you can remember.
