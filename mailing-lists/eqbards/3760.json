People had<br/>\n1000&#39;s of them scattered everywhere, stashed in castles, and in banks of all<br/>\ntheir &#39;mule&#39; characters.  So what if they lost them?  You answered the<br/>\nquestion yourself - they were easy to get (just go kill someone that has<br/>\nthem).  I like the fact that I can spend my money on something and keep it<br/>\nuntil I want to get rid of it.  Not on a whim of a SnotBoy or KewlDuuude, or<br/>\nan NPC that wants what I have.  I don&#39;t think EQ missed it, I think EQ got<br/>\nit right for the majority of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nCwelenas, Minstrel of the 6th Chord (still)<br/>\nAngarth Bladedancer, Warrior of the 21st Tier (barely)<br/>\n&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tFriday, July 16, 1999 7:52 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eqbards] Re: Item Values<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; john writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Most people don&#39;t realize it, but a lot of the enjoyment of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the game is the anticipation just before you loot something -<br/>\n&gt; &gt;will it or won&#39;t it have a nice item?  I once modified the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;source of an RPG so I could start off with the best stuff.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;It made the game really boring - the item drops didn&#39;t matter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;because I already had the best stuff, so all that was left was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;endlessly killing monsters for experience.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think though that if less emphasis were placed on gathering items and<br/>\n&gt; accumulating wealth in EQ, more emphasis would be put on the social aspect<br/>\n&gt; of it.  I hate to use UO as an example but in this case it serves as a<br/>\n&gt; beautiful example.  It just had something EQ missed.  When you died you<br/>\n&gt; could count on losing every item you had been carrying on you, and no<br/>\n&gt; particular item was THE item that you HAD to have to stay competitive,<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; were all relatively easy to get.  So instead of being obligated to sit<br/>\n&gt; someplace for hours and hours on end, you might be able to entertain<br/>\n&gt; yourself or others in the local tavern, or magic shop.  This was SO off<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; subject, just gave me something to type about  -=)   Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
