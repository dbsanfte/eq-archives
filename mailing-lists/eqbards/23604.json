Trust me, there&#39;s nothing that&#39;ll irk us (and perversely, amuse<br/>\nat the same time) more than hearing about a sucky Bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to do a hall of shame on some of the Bards on Bertoxx.  I agree<br/>\nthat there are too many who just don&#39;t know how to use their abilities to<br/>\nthe best effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nPossible reason why: as most of the now 50+ Bards were growing up, they<br/>\nshared a lot of information amongst themselves and educated younger Bards<br/>\nwho followed them.  Then many bad things happened to the Bard class and<br/>\npeople stopped playing the class past level 20 or so for a while.  Recently,<br/>\nhowever, things have gotten better and interest has been re-kindled and<br/>\nwe&#39;re seeing many more Bards.  However, there&#39;s a &quot;Generation Gap&quot; between<br/>\nthe old and new Bards with very little middle ground to pass on what we&#39;ve<br/>\nlearned.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaces like the Concert Hall and this list help, but how many people do you<br/>\nknow would have the patience to wade through pages and pages of posts<br/>\ndealing with mainly level 40/50+ issues to find newbie posts that will be of<br/>\nany use to them?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
