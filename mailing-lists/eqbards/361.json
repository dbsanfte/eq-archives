Actually the weapon I preferred: a Giant Snake Fang.  O<br/>\nloved that fang, nice for lv 8.  The advantage, of course, is speed.  I<br/>\nbelieved, when I took up piercing, that the speed advantage may actually<br/>\neven-out the damage disadvantage.  One can procure a snake fang in the<br/>\nQeynos area cheapest (believe I paid 5 gold, but some say folks there<br/>\nactually give them away), for fangs come off beasts from that BB dungeon one<br/>\ntakes to reach Halas.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I have Anthem de Arms and Whistling Warsong, I just may set my<br/>\nMinotaur Axe aside for a bit and grab that dusty fang from the bank.  Always<br/>\ngood to keep piercing high anyway, but perhaps with the speed bonuses of<br/>\nthese songs, my fang will be even more effective?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note (pun intended), I noticed Lament seems to function better.<br/>\nFor a while it was great, then there was a patch, and at that time I noticed<br/>\nI could now actually lament myself, definitely meaning a tweak to the song.<br/>\nAt that time, I was dismayed to see how quickly the effects wore off!  But<br/>\nnow, just this morning, I tried it again on myself and the effects lasted<br/>\nmuch longer (even longer with my mandolin).  It also worked rather well on<br/>\nan orc camp loaded with Blue Cons.  Maybe it&#39;s just me, but for a week there<br/>\nLament just caused things to attack me, but now I seem to find it useful<br/>\nagain.  (Still not going to try lamenting a sand giant though!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
