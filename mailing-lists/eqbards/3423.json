Since level 3 I have kept 1 hand slash,<br/>\n1 hand Blunt and Piercing all maxed. I have tried to<br/>\nkeep Hand to Hand maxed as well but it seems to raise<br/>\na few points each level and then stop. Does this skill<br/>\ncap lower per level than the other weapon skills? <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond question is about being interupted while<br/>\nplaying. My only other character is a Rogue so forgive<br/>\nme if my magic user references are wrong, don&#39;t know<br/>\nmuch about them :)  When I got my heal song I took off<br/>\nafter a skeleton that conned white to me. I was<br/>\ninterupted alot. This had not really happened before<br/>\nat least not this much! Is Intstrument/Singing skill<br/>\nwhat helps prevents Bards being interupted like<br/>\nChanneling is to Magic user casting? If not what is?<br/>\nBTW I beat the skeleton but was not pretty *grins*<br/>\n<br/>\nThird (almost done :) on getting a new song about how<br/>\nlong is it level wise or skill wise before you can<br/>\ncount on playing that song well? Is there such a time?<br/>\nAnother thing that surprised me was that I mess up<br/>\nplaying that Heal song alot more than any of the other<br/>\nsongs I have.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly I noticed when I bought my Drums at level 5<br/>\nfrom the wood elf vendor she sold a Mandolin and Lute<br/>\nas well. Is there a difference in these two for<br/>\nplaying purposes? Or are they just two options for<br/>\nstring instruments?<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks for the help and safe travels.<br/>\n<br/>\nKobias<br/>\nLvl 6 Bard<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
