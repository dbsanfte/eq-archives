I was in a group with a 31 Bard who argued with me - that he<br/>\ntested it.  He tested it by timing how long it took for the casters to get<br/>\nfull mana after a battle.  When I asked if the casters always made sure they<br/>\nused up their mana - his response &quot;What difference would that make?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother case I was with another bard - and a Druid.  I asked the Bard why he<br/>\nwas doing Jig?  Because the Druid asked him.  I told the Druid that it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t (the usual blah-blah-blah).  Her response (I can&#39;t remember exact<br/>\nwords - but to the affect) - She had a 41 level Bard character - so she<br/>\nobviously knew more about it than I did (I was level 27 at the time).<br/>\n(Pardon me for having a life!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to your initial complaint..  You were in a no-win situation - if you<br/>\ntried to point out their flawed thinking - you would have looked like sour<br/>\ngrapes.  Those people were especially ignorant - given that since Anthem<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stack - you couldn&#39;t have been doing what he was if you wanted to!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - good luck to you - and hopefully you&#39;ll find better groups!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: G.W.
