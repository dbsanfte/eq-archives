However, there<br/>\n  is a killer GM on Innoruuk whose name escapes me, or rather will<br/>\n  remain confidential because I don&#39;t want to see this guy get booted<br/>\n  like our last head GM did.  The good people always are forced to<br/>\n  leave.  Anyway, this guy rolls up into PoF and is making me laugh<br/>\n  like every 5 mins.  Saying crap like, hey Soandso isn&#39;t about time<br/>\n  you eat another DT.  The guy was nutz, he was very friendly and<br/>\n  really could fit in with the players though.  Shoulda asked him to<br/>\n  pull Cazic for us, heh.  He seemed kinda new to the scene however.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
