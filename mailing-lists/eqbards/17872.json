(tho this may have changed.  there are only a couple bards<br/>\n&gt;left in the guild at dragon/god level.  there used to be enough to put a<br/>\n&gt;bard in every group.)  because of the guild rules this would only happen <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;us if we joined pickup groups at frenzied, with no guildmates that could<br/>\n&gt;*cough* use it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s a moot point for me now anyway.  i left the guild.  i never really<br/>\n&gt;thought it&#39;d happen.  these are my friends, not people to help me gather<br/>\n&gt;loot.  leaving over this issue would&#39;ve been foolish.  but it was pretty<br/>\n&gt;clear in the discussion that too many in the guild think we should make<br/>\n&gt;useful chars instead and only dig out the bards at large targets, where<br/>\n&gt;we&#39;re actually useful.  and what a god-awful burden it was getting us bards<br/>\n&gt;up to dragon/god level to begin with, why don&#39;t we shut up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;but they&#39;re still my friends, so i won&#39;t say the guild&#39;s name :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
