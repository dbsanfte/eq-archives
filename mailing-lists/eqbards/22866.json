I&#39;ll try it this<br/>\nweekend if I can.  It&#39;s a lute, so it&#39;s a string instrument (I gather).  I haven&#39;t used it for anything<br/>\nbut the effect though.  Two cool things:  the werewolf illusion gives a STR bonus (unlike some of the<br/>\nillusion masks, which give nothing other than the illusion), and it equips in the primary hand, so you can<br/>\nequip the Lute of the Howler and the off-hand mesmerizing Lute (Melodic Truncheon?) and attack with two<br/>\nLutes at once!  Dueling banjos!  hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 55 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Holden wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Saw this posted on Eqlizer:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/luteofthehowler.html\">http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/luteofthehowler.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone know anything about the mob, level, difficulty, enhancements to wind songs?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Ranian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
