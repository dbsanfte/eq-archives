I&#39;ve been hunting a lot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading all the other people&#39;s comments on this topic, I would add<br/>\nanother - I belong to a guild and we have many members who are higher level<br/>\nthan I who are usually pretty willing to help the younger level members by<br/>\ntaking them into new places to show them around - they&#39;ve been there, they<br/>\nknow the pitfalls, etc. If you are a member, see if they will help you. If<br/>\nyou are not a member of a guild, see if you can find someone from a guild<br/>\nthat seems pretty nice, and see if they will help show you around - this has<br/>\nbeen invaluable to myself and many others; it&#39;s certainly helpful to have<br/>\nsomeone right there with you while you venture into a place like that. I am<br/>\nonly L21 myself, and have not ventured into those places just yet, with the<br/>\nexception of Najena, where a higher level guildmate gave me a tour.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just another suggestion that might help.<br/>\n<br/>\n======= Brangwen Incantare, L21, The Rathe =======<br/>\n====== Squire Court of the New Outriders guild ======<br/>\n========================================== </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
