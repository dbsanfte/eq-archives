I party with a Shaman and Enchanter. I could<br/>\nnever, or seldom get my songs like Chain or Fear to stick to Yellow and Red<br/>\nmobs when I was solo. But if they debuff and Tashan magic resistance it<br/>\nsticks everytime. IE: Fighting Giants at level 32 I could chain a Giant to a<br/>\nwalk and our Shaman could dot the heck out of it while I kept it to a slow<br/>\nwalk. This is the only method to kite giants otherwise they run to fast.<br/>\nWhen damage is at 1/2 and they go from aggro to me for chaining to extremely<br/>\naggro to the shaman I step in and Chain/Fear the giant does a 180 and stops<br/>\ndead in his tracks while I and everyone else whacks the back of his legs. I<br/>\nrepeat the cycle over and over till he dies. No one gets hurt. But if no one<br/>\nlowers magic resist first you will never get it to stick.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 25, 1999 1:57 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Chain vs. snare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would imagine like most of our songs, the effectiveness of the song is<br/>\nrelative to your level compared against that of the mobs.  I&#39;m only 22d<br/>\nlevel so haven&#39;t had the chance to play with Chain yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently fighting primarily in Unrest and Mistmoore.  In Unrest, the<br/>\nLullably and Largos&#39; Binding song are pretty reliable, especially if I equip<br/>\nan instrument.  I don&#39;t get many resists when I play those two songs.  In<br/>\nMistmoore, the creatures there seem to resist those two songs more<br/>\nfrequently, especially Largo&#39;s.  I assume that is because the creatures in<br/>\nMistmoore are higher level than those in Unrest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I get Chain at level 23, will it be consistently effective/reliable if<br/>\nI use it against creatures that con yellow and red to me?  Based on my prior<br/>\nexperience, I would assume the answer is no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Huh?  Chain is snare + it lessens the attackspeed of the mob.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t get it.  What do you think chain does?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I will always override every snare/root I see with chains, much<br/>\n&gt; more effective for the party.  Slower attacks and the effect of<br/>\n&gt; snare.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I chain something, it AINT moving.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongrats to our GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nCheck out ONElist&#39;s latest program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
