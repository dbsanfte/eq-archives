Banks<br/>\ndo not pay interest.  There is no provision in the economy for capital<br/>\ninvestment.  Money is just a store of value or meduim of exchange.  500pp in<br/>\nthe bank is worthless.  A pair of Elf Hide Gloves has true value - stats &<br/>\nprestige.  The person who paid 375pp for them obvious felt that they were<br/>\nworth it compared to having 375pp in the bank doing nothing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGranted - he may have a hard time getting 375pp back out of them but if he<br/>\nwanted them that bad - he probably wont even think of getting rid of them.<br/>\nAs you get older, your access to plats gets easier, your stuffs get better.<br/>\nSo now you have most everything you want to wear and you have 800pp in the<br/>\nbank rotting away - now when you see something you want - you can pretty<br/>\nmuch have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat drives most deals (sales) of items is how bad the buyer wants something<br/>\nand the convenience of getting it.
