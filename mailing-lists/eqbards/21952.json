So they have 1 mob that is pissed off at them instead of 4-5 <br/>\nother ones to beat on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the taunt factor is so high after being mezzed like 30 times by your <br/>\nfriendly neighborhood bard, that they ignore the little newbie poking them <br/>\nfor like 5-6 pts and take swings at the big mean bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve run through zones seeing newbies fighting something that must have <br/>\nbeen yellow to them (like bandits in West Karanas) and will sit and just <br/>\n&quot;chain&quot; the creature for them. The taunt from chain alone keeps the mob on <br/>\nme while they whack away wildly.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:40 PM 10/12/00 -0600, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Uh, soon as you hit them they wake up, and most weapons swing twice in<br/>\n&gt;between pulses.

So yea, no benefit to the<br/>\n&gt;bard, but it would be a way to mess up play balance in a dungeon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Though I totally understand. You would expect a level 30 bard should be<br/>\n&gt;able to mesmerize level 1 mobs with 95% accuracy. It&#39;d just be sad to see<br/>\n&gt;people abuse such power. Don&#39;t you hate always having to play to the lowest<br/>\n&gt;common denominator? People have (and will continue) to crow about ways that<br/>\n&gt;they broke the game.
