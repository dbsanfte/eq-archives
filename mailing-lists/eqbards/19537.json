After breaking the camp, we settled into a nice<br/>\nthree hour session of &quot;Pop-n-Pull&quot;, (Me-34th lvl bard, 36 druid, 39 then<br/>\ndinged to 40 druid, a 40-ish mage, then later a 32 druid joined us), except<br/>\nfor one time where our puller pulled one and another spawned right in his<br/>\npath.  While the exp was nice, the loot was not worth our time.  All told,<br/>\nwe came away with 1 Black Pearl, 1 Axe of the Iron Back, a Word, and a sum<br/>\ntotal of 10pp in coins.  Was I expecting Forest Loops in every drop?  No.<br/>\nBut to personally loot 8-9 giants and have 5 or 6 with *nothing* (no items<br/>\nor money) is just wrong.  From even just a coinage standpoint, I would have<br/>\ncome out muuuuch better by far if I had just gone to SK and camped the<br/>\nHermit :oP  <br/>\nIs it my imagination, or did someone at Verant make a comment along the<br/>\nlines of loot being comparable to the difficulty of the creature?  FYI:<br/>\nthose giants are quite tough ;o)~<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing:  How much is Singing Steel going for on the other servers?<br/>\nSaw a level one bard mule last night auctioning SS Boots.  He told me he can<br/>\nget 15k plat for them.  For that much, I&#39;ld rather  just try to organize a<br/>\nguild event in Karnor&#39;s and loot them myself :oP<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\n34th<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nVisit Expedia.com for a chance to win airfare to Vegas for you and <br/>\n20 friends, $15,000 and a suite at Bellagio for New Year&#39;s.
