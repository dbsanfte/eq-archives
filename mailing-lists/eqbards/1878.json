The 5hp or so per pulse can not keep up with the dmg the<br/>\nparty is taking.  I say put the creature down as quickly as you can.  Maybe<br/>\nuntil you get to 23, Anthem and 2 Bellows, while boring, is most effective<br/>\nand i think that is exactly what i did.  then AFTER the fight, put on a<br/>\nmandolin and heal up the party.  Once you get to 23 you will be using chain<br/>\na lot to slow down the mobs from running and their attack speed.  At level<br/>\n26 having appaling screech memmed may save your life in many occassions.<br/>\nOnce you get to 32 you will be singing mana song a lot after fights.  At<br/>\nlevel 36 you can stack chant of battle and celerity to give the whole party<br/>\na STR, DEX, AC, and AGI boost.  What will happen is the higher level you go,<br/>\nthe far less you use Heal or Bellow.  You will be grouped with players who<br/>\nare blasting for 400+ dmg, so your 20 dmg or so bellow is not as important<br/>\nas buffing everyone elses melee abilities.  And it is a very rare occurrence<br/>\nto play heal, as there is always a cleric or druid in your party who can<br/>\nheal 400+ hp in one spell, and your mana song regenerates their mana far<br/>\nfaster than your heal song can regen their hp.  so don&#39;t despair, there are<br/>\nnice songs in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I don&#39;t like being &quot;ordered&quot; to do anything in a group, by leader<br/>\nor other members.  They do not play a bard, therefore they can not know all<br/>\nof our benefits to a party.  If the group asks and we agree on a strategy,<br/>\nno problem.  but if it pisses you off like it does me to be ordered around,<br/>\njust tell them &quot;next time you tell me to play that song will be the last<br/>\ntime i play it.&quot;  usually that shuts them up, especially if it is the mana<br/>\nsong =)<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Silverleaf, Level 44 Bard, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll also use Guardian or Elemental Rhythms if we&#39;re fighting<br/>\n&gt; a spellcasting mob.  Has anyone else noticed that Elemental<br/>\n&gt; Rhythms actually increases your magic resist the same as<br/>\n&gt; Guardian (at least up to L20)?  The only advantage of Guardian<br/>\n&gt; is that it gives me 1 extra AC, and that didn&#39;t happen until I<br/>\n&gt; was L20.  Before then, Elemental was either the same or<br/>\n&gt; better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
