McCloskey [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s.mccloskey@...\">s.mccloskey@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 28, 2000 11:20 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] The Bardic Kiter <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I too play on The Rathe, so you might find this amusing B <br/>\n&gt; (seems to be a<br/>\n&gt; lot of ignorance on Rathe).  Instead of boring you with a <br/>\n&gt; long story I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; make it short.  I had a day in Ill Omen a month back when I <br/>\n&gt; was charming.<br/>\n&gt; All alone in part of the zone, I had not seen another player <br/>\n&gt; in about an<br/>\n&gt; hour.  I was charming mobs for one on one fights.  This <br/>\n&gt; warrior and bard(of<br/>\n&gt; all people!) come along and start trying to kill steal.  Now <br/>\n&gt; they have me<br/>\n&gt; distracted and two wandering mobs jump me.  No problem, I&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; just run in<br/>\n&gt; circles while charming.  They start disrupting the mobs that <br/>\n&gt; are following<br/>\n&gt; me by hitting the one my pet is on, by now I lose about 400 <br/>\n&gt; hp because of<br/>\n&gt; it.  While they are killing one of the mobs, some fool caster <br/>\n&gt; trains me<br/>\n&gt; with 6 mobs.  I give a real life sigh and just figure if the <br/>\n&gt; warrior and<br/>\n&gt; bard go away I&#39;ll just have a 30 minutes challenge on my <br/>\n&gt; hands (sounds like<br/>\n&gt; fun!).  Nope . . .<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is the good part.  Half way through killing these I get a tell.<br/>\n&gt; Warrior: &quot;If you do that again I&#39;ll have your account banned.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Me: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Warrior: &quot;You were charm kiting.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Me: &quot;Yea, since when is that against the rules?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Me: &quot;Aren&#39;t you the one who just tried to kill steal?  You <br/>\n&gt; know that IS<br/>\n&gt; against the rules, and I could petition you for it, but I am not.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Warrior: &quot;You had about 10 mobs on you.  You are hogging all <br/>\n&gt; the kills.<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re not even getting hit.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Me: &quot;Yea, because I was trained.  I usually only have a one <br/>\n&gt; on one fight<br/>\n&gt; until people jump in where they don&#39;t belong.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Me: &quot;So you are going to petition me because you&#39;re jealous?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Warrior: &quot;It&#39;s not fair, your not getting hit, so that is exploiting.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Me: &quot;Go ahead and petition then.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was on for probably another 4 or 5 hours that night and I <br/>\n&gt; never got a<br/>\n&gt; tell from a GM, I assumed they just laughed, if he petitioned at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ignorance at it&#39;s finest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Steve<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 02:54 AM 8/27/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Pulling only 2 (somehow), I began my craft.
