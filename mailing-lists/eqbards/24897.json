Why?  Because I wasn&#39;t happy with my<br/>\n&gt;choice of religions.  In order to be able to visit anywhere, I decided that<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d better work without any religion at all.  Now for the fun part -<br/>\n&gt;regaining my levels, *without* being powerlevelled.  It&#39;s amazing how a<br/>\n&gt;well-played bard can seem like he&#39;s being power-levelled anyway ;).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In 26 hours of play, I regained all 11 levels, and improved my faction<br/>\n&gt;enough to be indifferent in Ak&#39;Anon (got to work on that just a wee bit<br/>\n&gt;more), and in Rivervale to Amiable, probably half-way to warmly.  Still got<br/>\n&gt;a long way to go to get the squad ring ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My question is - just how effective is the Carillon in situations like<br/>\n&gt;this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For those of you interested, I started in Kelethin, had a friend hand me my<br/>\n&gt;eq back (full-banded armour, plus a lumberjack&#39;s cap, no jewelry, a combine<br/>\n&gt;long sword, Rukgus&#39;s sticker, and a Shiny Brass Shield that Talies had<br/>\n&gt;fought for to begin with.  I didn&#39;t want to be &quot;twinked&quot; - I worked for (or<br/>\n&gt;payed hard-earned cash for) everything I have.  No freebies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I stayed in the Kelethin newbie area for a while, collecting wolf pelts and<br/>\n&gt;spider silk to work on tailoring, and bone chips to sell to needy<br/>\n&gt;necros.  Only died once until level 4, when I went cliff-jumping with a<br/>\n&gt;crazy druid - just to see what would happen (I died ;).  At level 5, I gave<br/>\n&gt;up on orc-hunting - either I&#39;d get jumped, and no one would help, or I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;have a nice yellow all alone, and someone would steal it.  I headed for the<br/>\n&gt;(relative) peace of Steamfont.  Stayed there until 8th, when I headed<br/>\n&gt;across the ocean to Misty Thicket (got bound in Rivervale, after 30 minutes<br/>\n&gt;of asking...)  Hunted Goblins almost exclusively until 10th, when I started<br/>\n&gt;mixing in other stuff for experience (and because there were a lot of<br/>\n&gt;faction hunters out there significantly cutting down on the numbers of<br/>\n&gt;goblins.)  BTW - Did you know that the Goblin Alchemist REALLY HURTS at<br/>\n&gt;level 10?  *ouch*.  Fortunately, a 49th level Necro killed<br/>\n&gt;him.  Unfortunately, for any monks out there, a 9th level Cleric decided to<br/>\n&gt;take the ribcage and wear it.  *sighs* Some people&#39;s children...<br/>\n&gt;In the process of gaining 11 levels, I&#39;ve kept all of my combat skills and<br/>\n&gt;music skills maxed, and worked a little on baking, tailoring and<br/>\n&gt;smithing.  All told, I&#39;ve made over 125 pp of pure in-the-bank profit (not<br/>\n&gt;including purchases).  Not a bad haul for one weekend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;11th and counting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
