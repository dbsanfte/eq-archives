How much does a diety effect your actual <br/>\n&gt;abilities<br/>\n&gt;and inter-race relations?  I play a Wood Elf bard, and have enjoyed it <br/>\n&gt;immensly,<br/>\n&gt;but chose my diety as Tunare for fear of fraction problems.  I roleplay my<br/>\n&gt;character as a romantic, so naturally Erolisi Marr (sp?) seems like a good<br/>\n&gt;choice, but I am unsure of it&#39;s effects on others.  Would love to hear from<br/>\n&gt;another bard who has tried more than one diety perhaps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Laeaus, Wood Elf Bard level...(sigh)...3<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I went agnostic with my bard so I couldn&#39;t comment on BARDS and their <br/>\ndieties. The only problem I EVER had with non-evil race merchants was the <br/>\nnon-half-elf spell merchants in Qeynos wizard guild not wanting to talk to <br/>\nme EVER. I kinda took pride in my charisma and my party liked to have me buy <br/>\ntheir things at a better rate. Anyways, I do have an example of a non-bard <br/>\nclass making a diety choice that affects faction. I had a gnome necromancer <br/>\nacquaintance who didn&#39;t have much problem with any merchants because he went <br/>\nagnostic instead of choosing an evil diety (as many do). He tried playing a <br/>\ngnome necro before that with an evil diety as patron, and had problems. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if this is still the case in the current state of Everquest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
