At 100k<br/>\ncustomers at $10/mo, that&#39;s $1 million/mo.  If all the profits<br/>\nwere being reinvested in the game, they&#39;d have 40+ employees<br/>\nworking on it all with salaries around $100k/year, with<br/>\nper-employee expenses running around $100k/year.

So far, they&#39;ve all been<br/>\ntreating this genre like any other game - code it, sell it,<br/>\nrake in the dough, slap on a few bug fixes.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
