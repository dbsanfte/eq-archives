There were only a<br/>\nhandful of people in the zone so we decided to pull the mobs back to the<br/>\nzone and fight there.  On one occasion, I pulled two familiars that we were<br/>\nhandling just fine.  Out of nowhere, a flouting gargoyle appeared.  None of<br/>\nthe other people in the zone were nearby so I know for a fact they didn&#39;t<br/>\nlead the gargoyle to us.  At the time the garg appeared, the necro was over<br/>\n75% health.  In an instant, he got zapped by something and was killed.  He<br/>\nchecked his text window to see what zapped him but couldn&#39;t find an<br/>\nexplanantion.  Later on, I made a similar pull.  This time I got three<br/>\nfamiliars by mistake.  They all attacked me so I started to sing Lullaby and<br/>\nput them to sleep.  Once again, out of nowhere, three flouting gargoyles<br/>\nappeared right on top of us.  I was around 60% health at the time.  Before I<br/>\nhad a chance to even start running to the zone, I got zapped and was knocked<br/>\nfrom 60% to dead in one shot.  Like the necro earlier, there weren&#39;t any<br/>\ntext messages to indicate I should have taken that much damage in one shot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am inclined to believe that our deaths were a result of a bug, which I&#39;m<br/>\ntold sometimes occurs in MM.  First off, the gargs spawned right next to the<br/>\nzone, which I am almost certain shouldn&#39;t have occured.  Everyone in the<br/>\nzone were in their 20s and camping around the lake.  I don&#39;t know where<br/>\nflouting gargoyles normally spawn, but I would assume nowhere near where<br/>\neveryone was pulling from (the pathway leading to the graveyard).  I can&#39;t<br/>\nthink of any reason how the flouting gargs got to the zone except due to a<br/>\nbug.  Second, the text messages did not indicate I got hit by a spell, which<br/>\ncould have accounted for losing 60% of my health in one shot.  Even if I did<br/>\nget hit by a spell, the damage that familiars can do in one shot (usually<br/>\nwith Force Shock), shouldn&#39;t be over 400 hit points.  I did get hit for<br/>\nphysical damage by the gargs but not enough to do 400 hit points of health,<br/>\nwhich was about what I had when they appeared.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else had similar deaths in MM? <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n26 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
