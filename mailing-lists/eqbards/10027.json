Zoned out of <br/>\nPermafrost naked.  Zoned back in to see if I would get my stuff (thought <br/>\nwhat the heck let&#39;s try).  Entering into Permafrost dungeon i was greeted <br/>\nwith the view of the area around Halas with people falling from the sky.  In <br/>\na cliff was my corpse which i could not loot.  Now for the really surreal <br/>\nthing.  Not everybody was seeing the same things.  Most were seeing <br/>\nPermafrost as the icy cave it is and someone dragged my corpse to the zone <br/>\nborder.  I camped and relogged.  Logging back in I was fully clothed.  I <br/>\nlost a weapon though.  I did a petition and bug report but got no reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewdeur Fflamson<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. first post in about 3 months!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Funny anecdote.  A friend of mine was running from a train and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;managed to zone.  You know how mobs can still hit you for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;while after you&#39;ve zoned and you come out with fewer hp than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;when you hit the zone?  Well, apparently one of the mobs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;rooted my friend during this interval.  He came out safe on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the other side, but rooted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was once rooted JUST BEFORE I zoned, but the force of the mob hitting me<br/>\n&gt;knocked me through the zone. I came out alive, and still rooted. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, once I was running from a tentacle terror in Najena, and I was almost<br/>\n&gt;dead and down to a walk (with a ranger, no speed song *cry*). I was surely<br/>\n&gt;going to die. But the tentacle terror hit me with one of his spells that<br/>\n&gt;throws you to the other side of the room, and since he was behind me, he<br/>\n&gt;blasted me through the zone and gave me a one-way superspeedy ticket to<br/>\n&gt;safety.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Daleia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
