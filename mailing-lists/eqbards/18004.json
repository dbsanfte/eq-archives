And reiterate<br/>\nwhat Sylly said about chasing down the fleeing mobs...<br/>\nBE SURE LARGOS (or DDD .. or COD) is OFF!!!!  I dont<br/>\nknow how many deaths ive had to that bit of<br/>\nfoolishness on my part.  The other thing is that since<br/>\nthe lowered agro of our songs, I can use all<br/>\ninstrument attack (hymn, cod, ddd) in there just fine<br/>\nwith out a healer.  I use the instruments then for<br/>\nmaximum hymn benefits, and as long as I have my<br/>\nmandolin out, I can also feel useful with CoD, and<br/>\nDDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nIve spent many hours in there with no healer and it<br/>\ncan be done.  The only bad combination Ive seen is 3<br/>\nbards, and no other melee.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love HK, because, as you said no long corpse<br/>\nretrieval runs, relatively safe, and really good xp. <br/>\nThe downside is that if you get on in prime time (on<br/>\nbristlebane anyway) expect to wait at least an hour<br/>\nand often two for a group.  One saturday night, I got<br/>\na tell five (yes 5) hours later saying my name was up.<br/>\n Needless to say, I had found a group at aviaks by<br/>\nthen.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Elijah Meeker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks a LOT!
