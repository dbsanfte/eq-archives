No healer, and what&#39;ll end up happening is<br/>\nthe bard will die while everyone else is at full health.  That<br/>\nis bad tactics plain and simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bard should be encased in the best armor the group can<br/>\nafford (assuming you group with the same people most of the<br/>\ntime).  Since you&#39;re going to be absorbing most of the damage,<br/>\nit&#39;s more cost-damage-effective for the other group members to<br/>\ngive their plate to you to wear.  :-)  I suppose it would be<br/>\neven more effective with an enchanter&#39;s Rune spell (damage<br/>\nabsorbing skin) or a druid&#39;s damage shields (short duration,<br/>\nbut damages the target every time they hit you).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The other problem is making sure the <br/>\n&gt; group knows to only attack one monster. This is wise in almost any <br/>\n&gt; situation, so it&#39;s a good habit to get into.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s amazing how many people don&#39;t know this.  Thankfully, it<br/>\nseems a greater percentage of folks who&#39;ve made it to level 20<br/>\nhave figured it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not too clear on if it can be twisted effectively though.

Whites or yellows I&#39;ll just leave it running.  <br/>\nReds... don&#39;t even bother using it.  It can help (especially<br/>\nif it&#39;s a spellcasting red, or a single red mixed with blues),<br/>\nbut otherwise having all the red mobs attack just you is a<br/>\nquick way to get killed.  In addition to a healer, I&#39;d say a<br/>\nrogue is very helpful in this regard since a lot of times his<br/>\nbackstabs can get at least the currently targeted mob&#39;s<br/>\nattention off you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Pain in the ass explaining it to every new person I group<br/>\n&gt; with though ;P<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And a pain in the ass explaining it to someone who is unaware<br/>\nwhat this song can do, and yells at you because &quot;you&#39;re not<br/>\nplaying any songs damn it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
