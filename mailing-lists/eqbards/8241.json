The<br/>\nbreastplate is the only piece I want.  Combined with steel for all the other<br/>\npieces, I think that would look pretty cool.  Call me vain but with a CHR of<br/>\n115 it fits my character:-).  Based on the horror stories I&#39;ve read about<br/>\ncamping for rubicite, must admit I do not look forward to ever doing it.    <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nRoll Tide!!<br/>\nBama 40<br/>\nGators 39<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; my bard doesnt have one piece of rubicite on him, and im proud of that<br/>\n&gt; fact,<br/>\n&gt; i cant stand cazic, so many jerks in that zone its sickening, the only<br/>\n&gt; reason im looking for rubicite is for my rogue friend, which has a silvery<br/>\n&gt; war axe to spare for rubi if i trade mine off, i also have Hatar&#39;s fine<br/>\n&gt; silk<br/>\n&gt; turbin which im trying to pawn off for some rubi for him, but no takers on<br/>\n&gt; that either...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minkin Nehoc<br/>\n&gt; Sol Ro<br/>\n&gt; Level 35 bard in full steel and other plates that look like steel<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Talies,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wondering where you heard this rumor from?  I read on EQVault that<br/>\n&gt; rogues<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and shamans were soon going to lose the ability to wear rubicite but saw<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nothing about bards being included.  This may end up being a moot point<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Solusek bard quests give bard unique armor.  I think I would prefer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing the quests, no matter how hard, versus camping for rubicite.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And just because some of you actually read my messages, here is<br/>\n&gt; today&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; secret: Get your rubicite armour while you still can.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
