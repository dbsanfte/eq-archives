Just<br/>\na<br/>\nfew basic questions, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re hearing for the 4356th time on the<br/>\nlist.  Sorry for the clutter... (But to be honest all the online guides<br/>\nI found were useless)<br/>\n<br/>\nStats, stats, stats...  To str or not to str... Tis better to dex<br/>\nthan...<br/>\nIn other words, what are your thoughts on starting stats?  I was<br/>\nthinking of making a half elf, since I want the better vision, and I&#39;ve<br/>\nplayed a wood elf before...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat skill is used when you kabong somebody with your lute?  Hand to<br/>\nhand?  1HB?  I figured it would be worth a practice for all those times<br/>\nI attack with an instrument...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other general starting advice?  I won&#39;t be twinking myself with my<br/>\ncleric.  (who was started on a new server for me (veeshan) to prevent<br/>\nmy<br/>\nfirst character from twinking him) (not a judgment on twinkers, I just<br/>\nthink it detracts from the fun, to each their own)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
