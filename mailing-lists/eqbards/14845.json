I can own an SG while all the HG i have tried have gotten me down to one bubble, one time a little less hehe. <br/>\nGreycloud BloodTalon&quot; (level 50 warrior)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;2081 HPs and 840 AC(self buffs only), Sprinkler and Sash, I solo them without LoH, but it takes all my mana on healing and they usually get me down below half after that. <br/>\n<br/>\nVaul TrueHeart <br/>\nHoly Knight of Marr&quot; (level 50 paladin)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I killed HGs in west commons with 1586hp (self buffs only), not an arrow shot.
