I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-853368819\">Here&#39;s a story of what happened to me my during my first visit to wisp<br/>\nisland in Erud&#39;s Crossing.  When I got on the island there was no one else<br/>\nthere.  I explored it but soon realized that I wasn&#39;t much for me to do on<br/>\nthe island.  The kerrans were all either blue or green and conned<br/>\nindifferently to me.  I had no reason to attack them so decided to just wait<br/>\nfor the next boat.  While I was waiting, I decided to attack some fire<br/>\nbeetles to pass the time.  I figured I could sell the eyes for some pocket<br/>\nchange.  To my surprise, every kerran on the island started racing towards<br/>\nto punish me for attacking the fire beetles.  Knowing that I couldn&#39;t kill<br/>\nthem all, I pulled out the drum and started running around the island.  I<br/>\nwas able to outrun them and pretty soon every kerran on the island was<br/>\nchasing me.  I was running so fast, I eventually started lapping the kerrans<br/>\nat the end of the train.  Like Forrest Gump, I just kept on running.  After<br/>\nabout 30 or so laps around the island, I saw the boat approach the dock.  On<br/>\nthe next lap, I quickly jumped on the boat.  Fortunately for me, none of the<br/>\nkerrans followed me onto the boat.  I guess there is some code in the game<br/>\nthat prevents mobs from getting on the boat.  After giving thanks to<br/>\nBristlebane, I quaffed a few Fierce Brews for the ride to Erudin.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Speaking of which, who all enjoys playing their Bard primarily because of<br/>\n&gt; the ability to travel rapidly?
