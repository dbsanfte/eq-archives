Then going to Qeynos will be a piece of cake - I even went<br/>\n&gt;to the North Karana gypsy camp at like level 5.  Also, at level 3, you are<br/>\n&gt;still a &quot;monster magnet&quot; and to get to Qeynos, you have to run by monsters<br/>\n&gt;in a couple spots (as you get bigger than these monsters, they wise up and<br/>\n&gt;ignore you but now they will attack on sight - which means as soon as you<br/>\n&gt;can see their icon they can see you and want to et you.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As far as getting crappy prices from the halfling vendors, you could try<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;vendors in Kithikor Wood.  There are 2 shops very close to the Rivervale<br/>\n&gt;zone and your faction may be different with these folk since they are<br/>\n&gt;hummies.  But again, until you get bigger, expect that monsters will view<br/>\n&gt;you as a tasty treat and don&#39;t wander about in Kithikor.  You have to go<br/>\n&gt;down the path a short way but no more than a hundred yards or so and you<br/>\n&gt;will shops - one on each side of the road.  Kith is still one of the most<br/>\n&gt;scary zones to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But if you must go - heed the advice of others and go nekkid with your good<br/>\n&gt;stuffs in the bank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Find the tunnel in misty thicket that goes into the Runnyeye Mines - run<br/>\n&gt;past the gobbies if they guard the entrance and zone in.  Now stay close to<br/>\n&gt;the wall on the right and follow it thru to the platform - run the whole<br/>\n </span></blockquote>way<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;even if gobbies jump on you - take all right turns hug the wall and zone<br/>\n&gt;into the Gorge of King Xorbb.  Check it out!  Some really big monsters!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;to get past them, you climb the wall on the left side and follow the left<br/>\n&gt;wall thru the gorge.  In a couple spots you will be forced down off the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wall<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and if you fall it will hurt bad. So be carefull on the turns and hug the<br/>\n&gt;wall. If you are forced down look first to make sure the traffic is clear.<br/>\n&gt;Then run hugging the wall until you can climb back up. Keep following the<br/>\n&gt;left wall until you see the canyon that leads you out of the zone - you are<br/>\n&gt;pretty much forced down at the end. Run to the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now you are in East Karana. Hug the zone wall on the right. Keep high on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;right until the river.  Keep and eye out for Broon - a big ol cyclops who<br/>\n&gt;hangs by the river. Give him a wide berth but watch also for Gryffins<br/>\n&gt;(flying monsters) and Gogrehounds and Plains cats.  Run parallel to the<br/>\n&gt;river giving Broon a wide berth - to the big wooden bridge - cross it and<br/>\n&gt;zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now you are in North Karana.  Keep the river on your left and keep going<br/>\n&gt;south until it starts to turn west.  At the river bend be ware of the<br/>\n&gt;Raiders - they are bandits and will attack if you get too close.  Give them<br/>\n&gt;a wide berth but keep the river on your left.  You will see a huge stone<br/>\n&gt;bridge - remember this because you can run across if you need to zone (and<br/>\n&gt;later you will prolly come back here for the Lute quest.)  But if you are<br/>\n&gt;going to Qeynos - don&#39;t cross it but keep river on your left and run run<br/>\n </span></blockquote>run<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;until you zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ahh now West Karana, run huggin the river on your left - a long long long<br/>\n&gt;run.  Past fisherman and womans two times and finally you see the Barbarian<br/>\n&gt;fishing village.  Now you can turn north and follow zone wall north past<br/>\n&gt;some towers keep them on your right and eventually a path that leads down a<br/>\n&gt;canyon to the west --take it and run to the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In Qeynos hills now and getting very close.  Follow the path giving the<br/>\n&gt;bears and wolves and everything a wide berth.  At the milestone take the<br/>\n&gt;fork to the west and run to the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Finally, you are in North Qeynos - run down the path (hopefully not meeting<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Fippy Darkpaw or the Queenie Klicknik) to the city guards & gates and when<br/>\n&gt;you chat with the folk explain that you have just come from Rivervale -<br/>\n&gt;certainly someone will bind you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you live on Innoruuk, give me a tell and I may be able to guide you if I<br/>\n&gt;am not too far away or otherwise engaged in a party.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sylly<br/>\n&gt;Bard of the 13th level<br/>\n&gt;a.k.a.

Any npc that will sell to me looks at me<br/>\n&gt; &quot;apprehensively&quot;.  I went to every npc I could find and<br/>\n&gt; found one that was disinterested ... but he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; (couldn&#39;t) sell to me.  So I&#39;m making crap money on my<br/>\n&gt; loot.  At this rate, I&#39;m never gonna be able to even<br/>\n&gt; afford songs, let alone any equipment (sewing kit &<br/>\n&gt; patterns for example).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I need help!  Either, point me to someone in Rivervale<br/>\n&gt; who will offer me decent prices or ...  If there isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; anyone that fits that bill, then I think I need to move<br/>\n&gt; on to Qeynos.  In that case, I need good directions from<br/>\n&gt; Rivervale to Qeynos.  Every travel guide I&#39;ve found gives<br/>\n&gt; the directions the opposite way around ... and they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; not easily reversed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks again,<br/>\n&gt; Wynsong<br/>\n&gt; Woodelf Bard, Level 3<br/>\n&gt; Rivervale, Qeynos<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ~~~ Remember that our illusion of control is just<br/>\n&gt; that ... an illusion ~~~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ICQ#1976509<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Attention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations KNICKS@ONElist.
