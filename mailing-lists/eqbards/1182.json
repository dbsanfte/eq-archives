For instance, when I was playing in a band I played<br/>\n&gt;100 times better when I was completely hammered. In the sense Verant is<br/>\n&gt;using it, being drunk seems to enhance a characters specialty (ie. Warriors<br/>\n&gt;fight better and main stats increase), so why shouldn&#39;t Bards become more<br/>\n&gt;rambunctious and charismatic?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--Danner Bramblethorn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Are you?
