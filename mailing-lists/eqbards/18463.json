I was dropping Blues fast, mixing in a<br/>\nfear chain every so often... Then, yesterday I was switching from my <br/>\nlute, had the pointer over it and the Drum went &quot;Poof&quot; !!!<br/>\n  I backed up and searched the ground in a panic. Nothing there !!! I <br/>\npetitioned and when the guide finally showed up her attitude<br/>\ninitially was &quot;Tough Toenails&quot;.. I finally talked her into reporting <br/>\nit to Verant as a possible Bug and if they review my log I MAY or may <br/>\nnot get a replacement. Moonflower is Disconsolate.. I love that drum.<br/>\n Now the question is... at level 42, what are the chances of getting<br/>\na Drum of Selos March as a replacement ?  ..rare drop off Nagafen ? <br/>\nAny tips ? <br/>\n      I appreciate any advice you guys can give me,<br/>\n      Moonflower Bllue, 42 Bard<br/>\n      Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
