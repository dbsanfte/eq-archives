All I want to know is how you can take out a whole camp using it?<br/>\n&gt; I tried this but it did not seem to work. I fought the orcs in east<br/>\n&gt; commonlands in their camps for quite a while. If i used the song on one and<br/>\n&gt; then attacked it, when it left camp, the rest of the orcs followed. Can<br/>\n&gt; somebody just explain all the uses of it?<br/>\n&gt; Thanks... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
