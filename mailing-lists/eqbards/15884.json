You can find him at loc<br/>\nneg5465 neg2718 (approx). He&#39;s inside the house within the brick wall<br/>\nsurrounding it. You won&#39;t be able to get inside the house to kill him but<br/>\nDDD, CoD (any ae song) will pull him out. Or, you can sit by the fireplace<br/>\nand say, &quot;I will kill you&quot; and he&#39;ll come out after you. I preferred to pull<br/>\nhim out with the song and back way off so he can&#39;t hit you thru the wall. He<br/>\ndoes cast, but if you are weaving DDD, CoD with hymn, it should be no<br/>\nproblem. Soon he pops out and hits ya and you just keep on singing. The only<br/>\nthing about him, though, is he is such good exp that he is camped a LOT.<br/>\nBut, keeping that in mind, you can hunt the whole zone while you wait for<br/>\nhermie to get free. Actually, South Karana is a great place for experience -<br/>\nyou can hunt aviaks, and if you get in a good group experience is great<br/>\nthere as well. Oh yeah, hermie is great exp from your level (you said 22?)<br/>\nuntil you hit 28.<br/>\n<br/>\n======<br/>\nBrangwen Incantare<br/>\n28th Level Wood Elf Bard (1.5 to 29 /cheer)<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n=============<br/>\n  &quot;You can say any foolish thing to a dog, and the dog will give you a look<br/>\nthat says, &#39;My God, you&#39;re right!
