Virtually every mob has a movement and idle sound of some sort.<br/>\n&gt; The sounds effects in EQ are the best of any game I&#39;ve every played.<br/>\nThat&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; the one thing that I have *never* seen a complaint about in any forum.<br/>\n&gt; There aren&#39;t any sounds that I can think of in the game that sound<br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; The next time you play, pay attention to some of the sounds and try to<br/>\n&gt; imagine how they came up with them.  Ambient sounds, beetles, spiders<br/>\n&gt; walking, snakes hissing, frogloks (splicka, splicka, splicka), Aviaks,<br/>\n&gt; lizards in CT, giants, Spectres, Ghouls...  The sounds effects in EQ are a<br/>\n&gt; work of art that surpass the graphics by a healthy margin imo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FYI: I&#39;m using Soundblaster Live!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [45 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yeah, I never had any idea.  Apparently bears grumble as they walk,<br/>\nwolves<br/>\n&gt; &gt; howl, giant beetles and spiders make funny chittering noises when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they walk?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I assume since no one has laughed and said I was insane that these<br/>\nsounds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really occur.  I was floored the first time a groupmate asked why I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hear a giant coming.
