People I group with I don&#39;t know/they look out for themselves.<br/>\n2.  I don&#39;t group with a cleric that can res me.<br/>\n3.  I am bound &quot;far away&quot;.<br/>\n4.  I die late at night when the group is close to breaking up anyway,<br/>\n    and the group will abandon me.<br/>\n5.  I die in a dungeon, not near a zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have 5 strikes here, I don&#39;t think Verant should have to consider<br/>\nsuch bad luck.  People don&#39;t seem to realize that the &quot;difficulty to get<br/>\nback&quot; factor should count into how you play an area.  In outside zones<br/>\nor in areas close to a zone, I know my groups usually play it pretty risky<br/>\nbecause we know we can all run away easily.  When we are in the king <br/>\nroom of LGuk, we are dang careful we never have to evac.  Why are we so<br/>\ncareful?  For us, its not the time to get back to the zone, its the time<br/>\nto clear our way back into the king room.  We as a group will accept<br/>\nless xp, fewer kills in return for some added safety.  I&#39;ve made<br/>\nit a point never to group deep in/with strangers...  <br/>\n<br/>\n(Yes I know the king room and the quick exit, there is no need to<br/>\nevac, I used a bad example, blah blah blah)<br/>\n<br/>\nRazzan<br/>\nDragonslayer<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; that in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>\n&gt; considering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the problem is<br/>\n&gt; magnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so when I play<br/>\n&gt; its usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull turns bad<br/>\n&gt; and someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far away,<br/>\n&gt; the party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the casters<br/>\n&gt; leave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get back to the<br/>\n&gt; zone they died in.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this into<br/>\n&gt; consideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.  I<br/>\n&gt; think they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play with<br/>\n&gt; all the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs personal<br/>\n&gt; welfare.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the casters in your group gate out and leave you to die, they are not good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; groupies.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ChickClick.com - girl sites that don&#39;t fake it!
