It *does* make a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  At 220s resist, I never resisted DragonBreath once.  Each breath attack<br/>\n  took 1 to 2 bubbles of life away from me at 2000+ hp.  If you do the<br/>\n  math that&#39;s 400-800 dmg per breath.  My client wasn&#39;t bugged out,<br/>\n  I wasn&#39;t getting display errors, I was actually taking that sort of<br/>\n  magnitude of damage, so was everyone else in my party.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dragon Breath is AE with diminishing damage from the epicenter.  I<br/>\n  did notice that when I was blasted by AE in the king room, I barely<br/>\n  lost any hp.  But since you&#39;re a bard, and you need to protect your<br/>\n  party so you have to get right up in there (allbeit, a step away from<br/>\n  the claws).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not arguing that resistance isn&#39;t helping, I&#39;m arguing that <br/>\n  even with strong resistances, DragonBreath isn&#39;t all or nothing,<br/>\n  and it cuts deep when it hits, which is literally everytime.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I dueled a Magician for fun about a month ago, played elemental<br/>\n  and guardian, and decided to let him nuke me until his mana was<br/>\n  gone (hoping I&#39;d resist everything).  Hell I even had GRM from<br/>\n  the enchanter with us.  That put my magic resistance way over<br/>\n  250.  While he couldn&#39;t Malaisement me at all, his DD shocks<br/>\n  penetrated hard.  It took him about 2/3&#39;s his mana to kill me<br/>\n  with straight DD magic based, I never once resisted fully his<br/>\n  DD spells.  They stuck for either a little dmg or full dmg.<br/>\n  Maybe if I had my resistance lower, I would have taken full<br/>\n  damage all the time, but with dragons even partial dmg is <br/>\n  deadly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not bucking the idea of resistance, I&#39;m not trying to disagree<br/>\n  to disagree.  Everyone has jumped onto the resistance bandwagon,<br/>\n  and think I&#39;m an idiot for questioning it.  But there is more than<br/>\n  meets the eye in this game for sure.  Things have never worked the<br/>\n  way we&#39;ve thought them to in the past, why would Verant make a game<br/>\n  calculation that made sense now?  Having all those resist items when<br/>\n  fighting a dragon would mean you&#39;d never die; they want you to die<br/>\n  when doing dragons.  That much is apparent.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I still have more testing to do, I need more data.  PvP and NPC<br/>\n  battles are two different beasts.  I don&#39;t know how people survive<br/>\n  in dragon fights without a healer as 5 or 6 AE attacks will usually <br/>\n  kill anyone, resistances or not.  If resistances were this definite,<br/>\n  my last Vox party would have lost no more than one bubble during every<br/>\n  breath attack.  Someone here said they only took 200 dmg at most,<br/>\n  which is like half a bubble.  I never once saw anyone in my groups<br/>\n  only lose half a bubble either of the two times I saw Vox.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve got more observing to do.  So far, my limited experience is<br/>\n  not backing resistances.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Got the chance to watch the initial gathering on Vox last night.<br/>\n  I saw no silver bracers (vox bracers), some people had helmets<br/>\n  indicating no crown, and no bards were there.  I believe it was<br/>\n  around 18-24 people, they creamed Vox hard FWIW.  No bards, heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I bet it&#39;s something like the INT/WIS fiasco.  Anything more than <br/>\n  200 has no effect?  Or something like that?  I bet as long as you<br/>\n  have a 100 resistance in something, you&#39;ll get the partial/full<br/>\n  dmg that you would at 200 or 300.  I&#39;ve never been feared by<br/>\n  anything at 90 magic, hmm, so why have 200? hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
