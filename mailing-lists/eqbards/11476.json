My friend died in Lava and I used locate<br/>\ncorpse, it pointed me in the direction of the Lavafall (which I didn&#39;t know<br/>\nwas there at the time. I got a Levitate (so did he) and went in, went over<br/>\nthe lava fall and tried to locate the corpse, nothing......<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up going in to Sol B, I shit myself (I was level 27) and zoned<br/>\nback, tried to go back the way I came and couldn&#39;t get up the lava fall, I<br/>\nwas really shitting it now, went back and had to go the Sol B way. So I<br/>\nzoned in and after burning my ass numerous times I was left with just over<br/>\n1 bub health. From the top of the lava there was a large cavernous area and<br/>\nin the middle on a raised island was a platform with people on, I floated<br/>\nacross and landed with a group of 6 level 45&#39;s+ they healed me up and<br/>\nshowed me the way out.

Sniderman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    The sequence of events for me - I fell in lava right near the entrance<br/>\n(from Lavastorm).  Given the number of hit points a 29 bard has - and the<br/>\nlava doing damage in 56 increments - I realized I had a good amount of<br/>\ntime - and tried to climb out.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I didn&#39;t realize this wasn&#39;t possible - and got myself in deep (nice<br/>\npun<br/>\nthere &lt;g&gt;).  There is a &quot;Lavafall&quot; (waterfall type thingy) that you can&#39;t<br/>\nclimb out.  Right past there is a zone to Sol-B.<br/>\n<br/>\n    My situation was that my Druid helper died because our levitations wore<br/>\noff.  Being the selfless type - he renewed mine before his - and<br/>\nsubsequently died when his fizzled.  I figured I could &quot;safely&quot; zone to B<br/>\nbecause I had a freshly renewed Levitate and would have plenty of time to<br/>\nzone back if I had no better luck getting our of the lava in B.<br/>\n<br/>\n    When I got to B - I can&#39;t remember exactly the layout (first time I was<br/>\nthere anyhow) but there&#39;s like a big cavernous area - so with levitate it<br/>\nwas pretty easy to get to solid ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n    As far as your question - the zone from Sol-B to Sol-A is already lava<br/>\n-<br/>\nso you&#39;d already have to have fell into lava in Sol-B to zone through Lava<br/>\nto Sol-A...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 07, 1999 10:31 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Lava & Corpses was Bard Handicap of Sorts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s. some one mentioned that you can zone out from the lava pool into<br/>\nSol-b?<br/>\n&gt; Does that mean that if you were to zone from sol-b you would end up in<br/>\nLava<br/>\n&gt; if you were not levi&#39;d when you zoned?
