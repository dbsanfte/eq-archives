I&#39;m lucky enough to have a roomie who plays, and we group all the time.  However, if I didn&#39;t, I&#39;d do what my cleric did (besides really liking my countess &lt;Hail *NOR/!&gt; ), and join a guild.  Instant pool of potential party members, hopefully mature enough to know how much good a bard is (Right, Barrd? :) ).  (now all I have to do is figure out how to get my bard a NOR &lt;New OutRiders&gt; tag :p )<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tanthalias <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lately, I&#39;m having serious trouble finding a group. I&#39;m a level 10 bard on Tarew Marr. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting in Steamfront Mountains. I&#39;m always looking for a group to hunt mino&#39;s (great exp, and their axes sell for 4pp to other players). Whenever I do a &quot;/ooc Level 10 Bard looking for a group&quot; I get no response. Even when there are other level 9-11 players in the area. Are we bards no longer a valuable asset in a group? Has anyone experienced this? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
