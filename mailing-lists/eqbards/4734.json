Was expecting a long run invis up that canyon but on a whim<br/>\ntold him to stand at the edge or the cliff and type /corpse.  Viola!  He<br/>\nsummoned it up some 500 feet!  Take advantage of that unlimited Z axis &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, found that if you have your party target you and use /follow - then<br/>\ninvis and walk - not run - they stay with you pretty good and don&#39;t seem to<br/>\ndrop invis because they seem to stay closer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to spend time with lower level chars who don&#39;t yet have their own<br/>\ninvis and see invis spells so anything to keep the group together helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 20th level<br/>\na.k.a.
