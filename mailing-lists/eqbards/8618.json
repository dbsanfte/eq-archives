That could explain why bards get<br/>\nattacked even when they aren&#39;t playing any songs at the start of a combat.<br/>\nOn numerous occasions my group&#39;s puller will bring back multiple mobs.  The<br/>\nmob he initially attacked will attack the puller.  The mobs that follow<br/>\nalways seem to attack me first and not the puller.  I&#39;ve gotten used to it<br/>\nand pretty much expect it to occur every time I fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; So my simple question is .... how can I avoid being the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;centre of attention!  In a fight that is, because clearly <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I need to be centre of attention at all other times! &lt;cough&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You will always be a &#39;Big Steak&#39; in the eyes of all monsters.<br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t even need to be playing songs or swinging a blade,<br/>\n&gt; for that matter.  I swear monster AI targets the bard in every<br/>\n&gt; party, because they are the single biggest threat to the mob.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
