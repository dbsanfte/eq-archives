Especially on Rallos (where I happen to<br/>\nhave a bard).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dot does not stack with itself.  What you may have been seeing with 2<br/>\nbards is 3 things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  fewer interrupts thus the effects were staying up more steadily, thus<br/>\ndoing more dmg<br/>\n2)  Two bards singing over-lapping songs, thus effects are staying up, thus<br/>\ndoing more dmg<br/>\n3)  Punching dmg IS significant espeically once you hit your 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s<br/>\n(up to 10dmg/punch)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, you were dropping the npc&#39;s faster, spreading the npc&#39;s dmg out<br/>\namong 3 instead of 2, and your dmg was steadier thus, overall, you did<br/>\nslightly more dmg with 2 than one bard.  You took (effectively) less dmg<br/>\nbecause you had 3 people sharing it while playing healing with a lute, thus<br/>\nmitigating what dmg there was more effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, no, bard dot&#39;s do not stack with themselves.  Different bard dots stack<br/>\nbut not two bards sining the same DoT.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emeeker@...\">emeeker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 24, 2000 10:26 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: reality check<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No, Just like any other spell/song you cannot place two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instances of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same song on a creature.  Same as for healing you cannot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;stack&#39; healing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with itself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Basically any song/affect with a &quot;duration&quot; cannot be stacked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This makes sense of course, but I am still left explaining what appened in<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; 2 bard 1 cleric group (all 34) at the giant fort in the Frontier<br/>\nmountains.<br/>\n&gt; With only 3 it very much seemed like you could easily see the effect of<br/>\n&gt; different strategies when fighting tumps.The cleric was only healing, the<br/>\n&gt; other bard was a fellow I know and who said the effects didn&#39;t stack, I<br/>\nsaid<br/>\n&gt; I thought they did, so as an experiment he switched from Melee to all<br/>\n&gt; instrument.<br/>\n&gt; We were taking about the same damage and the cleric was finishing with the<br/>\n&gt; same mana. The cleric reported that the health was indeed dropping faster<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; the tump,  both us bards being a little too busy to really judge. We<br/>\nfought<br/>\n&gt; for about an hour this way, and if one of us was doing no more than<br/>\npunching<br/>\n&gt; damage (and allowing fewer knocks out of songs) that means that one of us<br/>\n&gt; was superfluous, but I am certain a group of one bard and a cleric would<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; do nearly as well.<br/>\n&gt; I understand this is not a very scientific study, at all, but it seemed<br/>\n&gt; pretty convincing at the time.
