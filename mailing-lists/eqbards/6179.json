Last night, I did this quest, to<br/>\nobtain one of the lovely Langseax swords for my warrior pal.  For those of<br/>\nyou who don&#39;t know the quest, it&#39;s an upper 20s type of quest, and though<br/>\nnot particularly hard, it&#39;s certainly time consuming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did all the parts to the quest, obtained the final item (the murderer&#39;s<br/>\nhead), carefully sang my carrillon at the guy (who then regarded me<br/>\namiably), and gave him the head.  To which he said, &quot;Although the wolves of<br/>\nthe north bear you no ill will... blah blah blah NO SWORD FOR YOU!&quot;   (Okay,<br/>\nthat wasn&#39;t the exact dialog, but you get the idea).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it a warrior only quest or something?  It didn&#39;t seem to be.  Anyone else<br/>\nhad any experience with it?<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
