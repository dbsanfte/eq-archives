I have been<br/>\nagainst it from the start.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sure wouldn&#39;t mind a controlable melifluous melody, one that would take<br/>\nyou in the direction you wanted to go, to a distance that was determined by<br/>\nlevel (or blocking object).  It could even be mana based so that you<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t use it in place of selos. If it were group you could use it like a<br/>\nmini-evac (in outdoor places) just to get you free of the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and while I am on the local teleporting topic, I understand why<br/>\nMelifluous motion shouldn&#39;t take you through walls, but if those walls are<br/>\nsomething that a person could get over with levitate (like the Hermit&#39;s<br/>\nwalls in South Karana) I think you should be able to do it, heh, I just want<br/>\nan evac from that freakin gnoll...<br/>\n<br/>\njust my two coppers,<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
