Lay on Hands was VERY handy as a Guide (I could rez, AND fix up <br/>\nthe recently rez&#39;d player instantly).<br/>\n<br/>\nGuides cannot &quot;give&quot; themselves anything, however. In fact, when a new <br/>\nguide first starts his/her apprenticeship, they&#39;re given a Staff of <br/>\nGuidance (effect: Gate) and that&#39;s it.  Once elevated to full Guide status, <br/>\nGuides can get armour and equipment off of the vendors in CS Home, but <br/>\nthey&#39;re limited to 3 colours of armour, and cloth for monk-guides.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have, however SEEN a Bard guide - but since you can&#39;t buy spells or songs <br/>\nfrom real vendors, a bard guide wouldn&#39;t be able to use his special <br/>\nstuff.  That&#39;s why guides are given tools of the trade.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn service,<br/>\nFormer Guide Jalviv the Just of Tarew Marr<br/>\nnow just Talies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
