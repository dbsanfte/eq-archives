I<br/>\nrealized that my chief strength should be speed, take most advantage of my<br/>\nbuffing songs that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider this: Recently a troll and I were good naturedly beating on the<br/>\nsame monster... he with some gigantic sword that seemed to be doing a<br/>\nmassive amount of damage, and me with a fine steel spear.  He bashed, I<br/>\nbellowed.  And when all was said and done I got the loot.  The troll was<br/>\nquite upset, stared down at the little man with the toothpick, couldn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand how I had bested him--especially when I conned &quot;blue&quot; to him.  Do<br/>\nnot underestimate a fast weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s formulas about this people have posted here, I honestly think your<br/>\nproblem is that damn axe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I should upgrade to a combine weapon, haven&#39;t gotten around to it<br/>\nyet.  And you know, almost tempted to grab a rapier...   can&#39;t decide if I<br/>\nshould.  Have a feeling the rapier might not be such a great &quot;main&quot; weapon,<br/>\nyet I&#39;m certain I&#39;ll use a rapier when I dual wield.  (Part of my attraction<br/>\nis that they look so damn cool, and I never see anyone using them.)  For now<br/>\nI use my spear, which has a fine damage/speed advantage.  I may simply buy a<br/>\ncombine sword now (to keep my other skill up), and the rapier later.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Lynn Uhlman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:uhlmar@...\">uhlmar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Friday, May 28, 1999 6:38 PM<br/>\n    Subject: [eqbards] Will the Bard get better....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Hello fellow Bards,<br/>\n.....<br/>\n<br/>\nbut for example, i bought a mino axe at lvl 9,  i still dishes the same<br/>\namount of damage now at lvl 15 as it did at lvl 9 except for the below song<br/>\nand it only does 8 damage.
