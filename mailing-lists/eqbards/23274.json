I love Mez and consider it much more effective than<br/>\nCharm because of it&#39;s ability to take more than 2 crits out of the<br/>\naction and in addition, after hitting 51 Moonflower is finding REALLY<br/>\nlimited song space. She can only have space for one crowd control and<br/>\nMez is it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
