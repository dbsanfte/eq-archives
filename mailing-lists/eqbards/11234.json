Or fallen through the world.<br/>\nOr lost due to a verifiable bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fall in lava. It is YOUR responsibility to get it back. (Hope you made friends)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo say that GM&#39;s are worthless cause they told you &quot;tough sh*t&quot; is lke saying &quot;Dang. I cut my toe off with<br/>\nthis knife. Perhaps I should sue the hospital cause they can&#39;t put it back on.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you plan to play around dragons, lava, gods. You SHOULD expect trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have died underneath Nagafen, but have still gotten my corpse. I have had guildmates lose thier corpses<br/>\non the other side of Fear. I have had guildmates lose corpses &quot;I forgot where&quot; in Sol B. But they have all<br/>\nbeen retrieved. No GM was even called because they all were of our own doing. (Lag related or not).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you need is a group of people that you can trust to assist you when the chips are down.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it is just me, but, if you lose your corpse in lava, don&#39;t go crying about the GM&#39;s not running to<br/>\nyour aid. They are not supposed to help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake responsibility of your own problems. If the problem is indeed a bug, then by all means call a GM.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
