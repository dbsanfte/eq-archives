I first made my songs red - I wanted <br/>\n&gt; to see them<br/>\n&gt; boldly, but that mixed in with resist so not good.  I then <br/>\n&gt; changed songs to<br/>\n&gt; yellow - that shows up really well in all modes.  Damage <br/>\n&gt; shields (if you<br/>\n&gt; still have them on) also show up in yellow, but I typically <br/>\n&gt; am not getting<br/>\n&gt; beat on that long even if pulling, so not a problem.  I also <br/>\n&gt; changed skill<br/>\n&gt; increases to red.  I use a parser sure, but I like to see <br/>\n&gt; them (or at least<br/>\n&gt; have a chance - blue sucks imho - I could never catch what <br/>\n&gt; was said - song,<br/>\n&gt; skill or whatever - in blue).  Anyone else play with this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Piemur Draggonsinger<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 31st Song </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
