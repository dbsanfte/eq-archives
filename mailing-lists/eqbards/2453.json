However, this is not a role-playing issue. <br/>\n  When you are sitting on the boat one second and on a rock the next with <br/>\nthe boat nowhere in sight, that is a bug. The /loc command is a bug-fix <br/>\ncommand. In a normal game situation I would not use it, but as a bug-fix I <br/>\ngreatly appreciate having it available and I SURE appreciate all the help <br/>\nfrom the great citizens of Norrath that frequent this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nZendarin<br/>\nThe Wandering Minstrel<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 08:50 AM 6/24/99 -0700, Jim Mattson wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Swim to -2140, 7490 or 220, -9210.
