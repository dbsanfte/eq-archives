Then you can switch out Anthem de<br/>\nArms , while keeping up healing, and mabye the MR song at level 9 (if<br/>\nneeded) or the wince song.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you&#39;re about to hit level 8, which is a great song.  Singing the level<br/>\n8 song will make the orcs/dervs sad, so that you can pull them one at a<br/>\ntime.  Remember to sing it to each orc/derv, or the others will follow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tSigma111 [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sigma7@...\">sigma7@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, March 24, 2000 10:41 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] Song weaving 101<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Sigma111&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sigma7@...\">sigma7@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heya guys...<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if you could tell me some very basic strategies on<br/>\n&gt; using our songs in groups and solo.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am about to hit level 8 so I dont have a lot of them, however what I do<br/>\n&gt; is start off by singing the str/dex song you get at lev1, then once its<br/>\n&gt; started<br/>\n&gt; I start up my regeneration song, then I start whistling the ancient<br/>\n&gt; warsong<br/>\n&gt; (lev 7)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; then I keep rotating between em to keep them going, and so far it seems to<br/>\n&gt; work<br/>\n&gt; nicely for me.  I will occasionally add in the lev 2 song that makes the<br/>\n&gt; enemy &quot;wince&quot;<br/>\n&gt; but its kind of dangerous and Im never sure if its helping much anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What are some tips I can look forward to using at future levels?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, well...I was gonna ask about some weapons...but Ill put it in<br/>\n&gt; another<br/>\n&gt; mail to keep this thread pure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cerulia<br/>\n&gt; Bard of 7.8 songs, Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
