The first set of data was with me singing Celerity<br/>\n(the dam/sec figures do *not* reflect attack speedups), in a<br/>\nconfiguration of 87 str and 119 dex (typo on the dex).  Last<br/>\nnight I tried it, this time singing Warsong and Chant of<br/>\nBattle.  That gave me 161 str, 119 dex.  Again, the way I<br/>\nprocessed the data removed any attack speedup component.  I<br/>\nalso went through and deleted data from times when Warsong or<br/>\nChant expired (and my str dropped below 161).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the Yak in my primary hand at 87 str, 119 dex, I got:<br/>\n<br/>\nYkesha (8/24) in primary<br/>\n9223 damage<br/>\n508 hits (56.0%)<br/>\n399 misses (44.0%)<br/>\n20 procs unresisted<br/>\n22 procs resisted<br/>\navg dam/hit = 18.2<br/>\nmelee damage = 4.24 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>\nmelee damage = 7.56 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>\nmelee damage + procs = 4.93 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>\nproc rate = 1 per 51.8 sec (1 per 44.0 sec adjusted for Celerity)<br/>\n          = 1 per 21.6 swings<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the Yak in my primary hand at 161 str, 131 dex, I got:<br/>\n<br/>\nYkesha (8/24) in primary<br/>\n8339 damage<br/>\n460 hits (57.5%)<br/>\n340 misses (42.5%)<br/>\n13 procs unresisted<br/>\n17 procs resisted<br/>\navg dam/hit = 18.1<br/>\nmelee damage = 4.34 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>\nmelee damage = 7.55 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>\nmelee damage + procs = 4.85 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>\nproc rate = 1 per 64.0 sec (1 per 51.2 sec adjusted for Warsong)<br/>\n          = 1 per 26.7 swings<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what does it all mean?  It means within the margin of error<br/>\nof this sample, strength does absolutely nothing for damage.  <br/>\nThe only difference it made was that my max damage went from<br/>\n33 to 37.  However, the frequency of these extra-high damage<br/>\nhits was so low that they didn&#39;t affect the average.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe extra dex from Chant does not seem to have made any<br/>\ndifference in the number of procs.  However, the sample size<br/>\nis so low (30 and 42 procs) and the dex boost (12 points) so<br/>\nsmall that I wouldn&#39;t consider this conclusive.  OTOH, 800 Yak<br/>\nswings is about a half hour of continuous combat.  If it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make a significant difference in that amount of time,<br/>\nthat means the effect, if present, is tiny.  Unless the AC<br/>\nboost is significant, I&#39;m probably going to drop Chant in<br/>\nfavor of something like a damage shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did have a slightly higher hit% the second time around, but<br/>\nagain it&#39;s probably within the margin of error.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe secondary weapon stats looked pretty much identical to my<br/>\nprevious test.  The only notable difference was I only dual<br/>\nwielded 51% of the time.  Maybe the range on the piercer is<br/>\nshorter or something - I spent a lot more time chasing the<br/>\nAllizesaur around last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese results pretty much agree with what other people (mostly<br/>\nshamen, concerned that their buffs are &quot;useless&quot;) have been<br/>\nfinding.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
