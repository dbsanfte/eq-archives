While you are certainly correct about<br/>\nrace/gender/etc, every private club (which represents a subscription<br/>\nservice like EQ), or business is allowed a no shoes/no service type clause.<br/>\nThe First Amendment cannot be invoked to allow you to recite erotic poetry<br/>\nat your local barbershop.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe barber can throw you out of his establishment.  Now, the law WILL allow<br/>\nyou to recite the same poetry in a public forum, such as the street<br/>\noutside.  That&#39;s not private property.<br/>\n<br/>\nG<br/>\n<br/>\n===============Original Text=======================<br/>\n<br/>\nNot true.  The Supreme Court has long upheld that private establishments<br/>\nmay<br/>\nnot refuse service to people on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, age,<br/>\nor beliefs.  They have long ago expanded this to include exercise of one&#39;s<br/>\nright of Free Speech. (The &quot;Fire!&quot; exclusion not included).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are exceptions to this naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn one notable case in point in Florida, a man was refused service in a<br/>\nprominent restaurant because he wrote a controversial column in a local<br/>\nmagazine.  The man sued the restaurant and lost, but was upheld on appeal<br/>\nto<br/>\nthe federal district court of appeals on the basis of discrimination.  The<br/>\nargument on the side of the restaurant was that having the man as a<br/>\ncustomer<br/>\noffended their other customers because they knew what he had written and<br/>\nthat writing offended them.  The court upheld that this was not sufficient<br/>\nreason to bar him from an otherwise public place, nor to refuse him<br/>\nservice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWish I could remember the exact case from my law class but unfortunately<br/>\nthat was 12 years ago.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
