I<br/>\nhave zoned out of Najena into a pool of lava.  The guide didn&#39;t bat an eye<br/>\nabout rezzing me so I figured it must happen quite often.  I also had an odd<br/>\noccurance happen last night.  I was zoning from Nektulos and had a couple<br/>\nguards on me.  and while zoning was disconnected several times.  When I<br/>\nfinally got back in I was in the NE corner of the zone rather than by the<br/>\nzone line.  I have only had this happen when zoning from Oasis and dropping<br/>\nin near the grassy section of N Ro.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRylos Darmadrigal Bard of the 21st (almost 22nd) chorus on E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
