The<br/>\n&gt; Crippling Blow is nice, but my understanding is that Warriors need to be<br/>\n&gt; below a certain Health threshold for this to kick in, which they usually<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t stay at (if they&#39;re that low, a healer is gonna be healing them).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that understanding incorrect?  And yes, I&#39;ll concur that monks and rogues<br/>\n&gt; are just badasses (I consider them to be the melee version of a nuker).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is incorrect.  Warriors make a crippling blow at any health.  You&#39;re<br/>\nthinking of their ATK stat going through the roof (Berzerk) whenever they go<br/>\nbelow 30% of their health.  Thus they hit more often when hurt badly.  But<br/>\nthe crippling blow is just another kind of crit.  And Warriors crit a LOT<br/>\nmore regularly than any proc&#39;ing weapon I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;The fact that we get Dual Wield and that other hybrids get Dual<br/>\n&gt; Wield/Double Attack (plus Kick, Bash,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Slam, whatever) means that they ALL do significantly more damage than we<br/>\n&gt; do.  And don&#39;t even begin to talk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about the three pure melee classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kick/Bash/Slam contributes even less than a bellow every third twist<br/>\n </span></blockquote>would,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; from what I&#39;ve seen, when speaking of outright damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Incorrect.  At level 34 a Ranger can kick for up to 23 points.  Kick<br/>\nrecycles about every 10 seconds.  So no, this is incorrect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;I logged some fights between level 43 and 45 just to get a feel for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>things,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I estimated that Bards do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about 50% of the melee damage that other hybrids do, and about 25% of the<br/>\n&gt; melee damage of the three pure<br/>\n&gt; &gt;melee characters.  That was including my dual Ykesha procs.  Btw, using<br/>\n&gt; &quot;similar weapons&quot; is not really a<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 50% of a ranger&#39;s damage is not insignificant in my mind, considering he<br/>\n&gt; gets double attack.  Again, though, you used the magic word &quot;estimated.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for numbers (if you still have the logs around) -- I want to<br/>\n&gt; know that X class at level L does Y damage per second against a mob of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>level<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Z, gathered from N fights.  I&#39;m stubborn/anal that way ;).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, you&#39;re looking for numbers.  But I think we can all pretty much<br/>\nagree that we do 50% of the dmg of a normal hybrid in Melee without having<br/>\nto crunch numbers.  I mean, why crunch numbers when that&#39;s already pretty<br/>\nobvious?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;good measure; weapon selection is part of the ability to do damage, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fact that weapons are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;class-limited gives advantages to classes with good class-specific<br/>\n </span></blockquote>weapons.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Oh yeah, Bards don&#39;t GET<br/>\n&gt; &gt;any...  The amount that a Bard contributes to melee shrinks drastically<br/>\n </span></blockquote>as<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he and his groupmates go up in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good point on the weapons.  (Except for rangers, of course... they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; typically dual wielding Ykeshas and EBW&#39;s just like us, until they get<br/>\n </span></blockquote>their<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; planes weapons.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, but we don&#39;t really need weapons (see below)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;PS - Given that Verant&#39;s design intent re: Bards was to make a class that<br/>\n&gt; significantly augmented groups,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and that they balance this by making them weak soloers, one would like to<br/>\n&gt; think that Bards would be one of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the first classes that a large (4-6) group would look for.  We&#39;re way<br/>\n </span></blockquote>down<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on any list that I&#39;ve seen.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What does that tell you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, I often hear shouts in Guk and Sol to the effect of &quot;Enchanter<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Bard wanted.&quot;  I get invites often for dragon raids, planes raids, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kedge<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; outtings.  Of course, it&#39;s usually because they want one of the Clarity<br/>\n&gt; forms or to break a room.  Also, there are more bards coming of age these<br/>\n&gt; days, and a group generally won&#39;t have more than one bard (unlike tanks or<br/>\n&gt; casters).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a side note, the new Chant upgrades should make life a bit easier for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; kiting-solo bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Raiel<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  I have no trouble whatsoever getting in groups with my bard.  I<br/>\nwould hazard to state that I have an easier time getting into groups than<br/>\nalmost anyone I know.  Even on an extremely crowded server.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as to this comparison of Melee dmg.  Why are we comparing our 2nd rate<br/>\ndmg method to other hybrid&#39;s 1st rate dmg method?  Our #1 damage producer is<br/>\nour songs.  Our songs vastly outdamage any hybrid&#39;s damage curve when used<br/>\ncorrectly.  If I twist CoC, DDD, CoD, NiV with my 50 bard on Test I do<br/>\ndamage very comparable to what a ranger or paladin or shadowknight of equal<br/>\nlevel can do.  Add to that my ability to regen mana for others, heal others,<br/>\nspeed others combat up etc.  I&#39;d say that Bards are not nearly as bad off as<br/>\nmany seem to paint us.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line:  Bards are not a melee class in the classic sense.  Yes, we can<br/>\n(and should) get in there and mix it up.  But no, we aren&#39;t meant to be up<br/>\nthere swinging swords all the time.  90% of the time our songs are our best<br/>\nweapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ L</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
