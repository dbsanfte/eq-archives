(www.afterlifeguild.org) It<br/>\ndemonstrates that post 50, all classes increase in power exponentially<br/>\nexcept for bards. The reason that all other classes scale that way is<br/>\nbecause of the way the mobs increase in power post 50. Bards however<br/>\nprogress in power linearly. An argument can be made that we give some power<br/>\nfor our wealth of abilities, but if you look at the very highest levels, we<br/>\nlose all of those additional abilities. Fear caps at 51, Charm caps at 53<br/>\nand Mez caps at 55. That means that a level 60 bard fighting level 55+ mobs<br/>\nis a liability to the party instead of an asset. We can no longer crowd<br/>\ncontrol, our haste and slow is vastly inferior to enchanters and shamen, our<br/>\nmelee is pathetic (to say the least). Our only role at that point is mana<br/>\nbattery.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards used to be useful in large raids for their ability to provide resists,<br/>\nbut given the influx of uber gear it is not difficult to obtain unbuffed<br/>\nresists in the 150s in multiple areas. Add to that the soft cap on resists<br/>\nand the fact that even with maxed resists many, many spells land anyway and<br/>\nbards have little to no use in a raid. We can&#39;t provide our primary ability<br/>\n(resists) and we don&#39;t do damage, so why bring us along?<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 21, 2001 2:03 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:30 PM 2/21/01 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think that bards are probably over powered in the pre 50 game and under<br/>\n&gt;powered in the post 50 game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I see absolutely nothing in this patch that addresses EITHER of those<br/>\n&gt;beliefs.
