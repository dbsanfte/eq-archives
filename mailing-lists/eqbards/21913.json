That&#39;s it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact of the 60 people in my guild (Praetoriate on Bertoxxulous), I&#39;m the<br/>\nonly serious Bard.  We&#39;ve got a level 8 twink, and he only ever comes on<br/>\nwhen his regular hunting partner isn&#39;t on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I feel like the proverbial redheaded stepchild, but in time I<br/>\nsuppose that&#39;ll have its advantages.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Windleaf is on Bertoxx, too, but I&#39;ve yet to see him on the /who all<br/>\nbard 30 60 list... (are you anon?)
