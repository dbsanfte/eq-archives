Its a great way to try out new tactics.  Ever since<br/>\nshe got her greater heal (level 39) she&#39;s been trouncing me quite<br/>\nregularily.<br/>\nYesterday, just for fun, I said &quot;okay, I&#39;m going to fight you without my<br/>\nweapons&quot;.  She was a little confused, but a agreed.  Twisting Hymn, DDD, and<br/>\nChords with a lute equipped got her down to 15 HPs before we called it off.<br/>\nI had about a bubble left.  Not bad considering when I fought her with my<br/>\nweapons she wasn&#39;t even down to half life when I was running for the zone.<br/>\nFor reference, I fight either with a staff of writhing and a silvery axe, or<br/>\na silver axe/dirk combo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 38 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
