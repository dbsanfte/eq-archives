Wizards, Enchanters, Magicians, and Druids<br/>\nare the only pure spellcasters (Druids technically being a hybrid, but only<br/>\nof pure spellcasters, thus making them one).  Clerics are a hybrid of<br/>\nwarrior and spellcaster (healing spells).  This is proven by the fact that<br/>\nthey can use heavy metal armor and strong blunt weapons, and can usually<br/>\nhold their own in battle, yet being a very effective magic class at the same<br/>\ntime with healing spells.

With Selo,<br/>\n: we can travel much faster than any other class (besides the high level<br/>\ngate<br/>\n: spells).  And I don&#39;t understand where you think we are &quot;supposed to be<br/>\nthe<br/>\n: most traveling class in Norrath&quot;.  My Cleric has traveled much more than<br/>\nmy<br/>\n: Bard, and this was before the Cleric had Bind Affinity.<br/>\n:<br/>\n: Selo&#39;s does disrupt SoW.  This is most likely a bug.  Selos also disrupts<br/>\n: Root.  This is most likely the same bug.  Fixing one bug will fix the<br/>\nother<br/>\n: bug.
