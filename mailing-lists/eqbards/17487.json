On golems and clerics, I switched to buffing<br/>\n&gt; mode, and on everything else I twisted the Chants.  I noticed that on mobs<br/>\n&gt; that I was able to stick the Chants on consistently, we always got the<br/>\n&gt; experience (2 tanks, cleric, druid, bard, and non-nuking enchanter) -- I<br/>\n&gt; stopped taking counts after we got the first 4 of 5.  Also, that&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; first<br/>\n&gt; time I&#39;ve ever been summoned by /anything/ in my entire bardic life, and<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; felt GOOD!  (I was getting jealous of seeing everyone else&#39;s name spam by.<br/>\n&gt; I got summoned 3 times total, actually.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As long as there is a warrior or ranger in the group, I tend to have<br/>\n&gt; little<br/>\n&gt; problem drawing attention twisting these three songs.  If not, I do draw<br/>\n&gt; some heat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just one note, though: since these are DoT&#39;s, the only benefit of having<br/>\n&gt; two<br/>\n&gt; bards play them is to overcome resist rates (which is definitely a benefit<br/>\n&gt; that shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly).  Since the songs don&#39;t stack (okay, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; assuming here, since it&#39;s a DoT effect), two bards who are each able to<br/>\n&gt; consistently stick the songs won&#39;t buy you a lot.  Of course, in the<br/>\n&gt; Planes,<br/>\n&gt; it does seem warranted.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I tested just before going to the Hate and verified that the Resist debuff<br/>\n&gt; components do stick with the shammie line (combined dropped me 89 points<br/>\n&gt; with an MM drum).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Raiel<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; . </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
