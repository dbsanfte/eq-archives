I am about sick of camping<br/>\nHighpass Keep, and as looking for some yummier spots. (ie non boring)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am attaching a post I sent to EQ-Baking... This will explain to everyone<br/>\nhow to get good baking skills with minimum cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaking seems to be the only skill I could afford to get to master, due to<br/>\nits relativly low cost and VERY nice profit margin once you get a high<br/>\nskill. (As a Bard, 75 INT does not lend itself to learning skills)<br/>\n<br/>\nBe sure and read the PS of my post below to learn to power bake yourself<br/>\nto 135.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a primer on baking, goto <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loreseekers.com/guides/baking.html\">http://www.loreseekers.com/guides/baking.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nFrashii (Vanitii?), 30th Strum Bard<br/>\nSeekers of Lore officer, Tarew Marr\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loreseekers.com\">http://www.loreseekers.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPS. Cooking supplies can be bought in Steamfont, West Karana, East Commons<br/>\nalso.<br/>\n<br/>\nPPS. Any bards on Tarew Marr who want to chat, please give me a /tell =)<br/>\n<br/>\n------ REPOST from EQ-Baking ------<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, I&#39;ll rant about the benefits of fish fillets!! <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the profit for fish fillets : (This is for the benefit of everone)<br/>\n<br/>\n1 Fresh Fish (26 Copper) + 1 Jug of Sauce (10 Copper) <br/>\n                        = 2 Cakes that sell for 58 copper each<br/>\n<br/>\n        Hence 36 copper becomes 116. Thats MORE THAN TRIPLE.<br/>\n        (Barring no failures)<br/>\n<br/>\nNet result ? Backpack full of fish and backpack full of sauce <br/>\nyield 12.8pp when done, without failures.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo 2 sets of these, and you will prolly have paid for all the <br/>\nfish/batwings it took to get you to 120+ (see PS below) there<br/>\nis NO other skill out there that can recover your inital investment<br/>\nthis quickly, AND have a great profit base for the forseeable future.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Point of reference, an enchanter friend of mine went to 135 in 2 hours,<br/>\nrecovered all his investment, and was making a profit in 3).<br/>\nAnd get this... YOU CAN DO IT WHILE MEDDING! (Yes! that means<br/>\nall you finger wiggling bookworms can make money while you med!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other nice thing is that I was able to AFFORD to get my <br/>\nbaking skill to 135 with a 75 INT. (Bards dont need INT)<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember : The above is with 111 CHA and Aimiable faction.<br/>\n(Bards can &#39;faction bend themselves, and CHA is a primary <br/>\n bard stat)<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nFrashii (Vanitii?), 30th String Bard<br/>\nSeekers of Lore Officer, Tarew Marr  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loreseekers.com\">http://www.loreseekers.com</a><br/>\nMaster Baker (135), Just need to get some darn snake eggs to make pies<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. Quick Recipie for &#39;power bakers&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nGoto E. Freeport, buy 2 backpacks of fish at the docks. <br/>\nGoto W. Freeport, buy 2 backpacks of batwings at the Arcane Shop<br/>\n        (Magician Shop, 2nd floor, first woman on right)<br/>\nMake Fish Rolls, Welcome to Everclick!<br/>\n<br/>\nWash. Rinse. Repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Fish Rolls triv out at 135, you are getting to about 120<br/>\n to make the fillets (which triv out out 85) fail less)<br/>\n<br/>\nI KNOW the above is not profitable, just easy, since the zones are <br/>\nright next to each other and you can do all this quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As an aside, I cook - I actually carry a spit around with me.
