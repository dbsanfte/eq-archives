If you would dig back to that<br/>\noriginal post, you&#39;ll see that I said something that amounted to &#39;all else<br/>\nbeing equal, or near equal, opt for the faster weapon&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a few hard numbers to chew on:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe actual formula for double attack is (SKILL+LEVEL)/500, with the integer<br/>\nconverted to a percentage.  50th level with 200 skill equals 250/500, with<br/>\n.50 being the result.  50 percent chance to double attack. Monks cap at 250<br/>\nin DA, all other classes cap at 200.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor dual wield, it&#39;s (SKILL+LEVEL)/600.  50th level with 200 skill equals 40<br/>\npercent.  Monks cap in Dual Wield at 250, and rogues cap at 210.  All other<br/>\nclasses cap at 200.  Also, once dual wield exceeds 149 in skill, checks are<br/>\nmade to see if you double attack with the secondary as well, provided you<br/>\nhave double attack as a skill.  This check is based on your dual wield<br/>\nskill, and its corresponding percentage chance.<br/>\n<br/>\n[For those of you wondering why monks get such a bonus in DA/DW, keep in<br/>\nmind that monk hand speed never drops below 30.  They need the increased<br/>\nattacks to remain competitive with other melee classes who can use faster<br/>\nweapons, weapons with proc effects, etc.]<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to bore you all to tears with all the charting and the<br/>\nformulae used, Monte Carlo simulations, how the fixed damage bonuses due to<br/>\nstrength, offense and weapons skills seriously skew the results in favor of<br/>\nspeed, and about half a dozen other variables.  Most of those numbers are<br/>\nintentionally and forever hidden from the end users view.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuffice it to say with two weapons of a given efficiency, the faster will<br/>\nalways win out in terms of real damage in any time period beyond 30 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, the faster the weapon is (while maintaining the same eff. rating), the<br/>\nwider the gap in damage results between it and the slower weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing round numbers here, and mythical weapons, both with a .25 efficiency<br/>\nrating, a 5 dam/20 delay and a 10dam/40 delay weapon.  All results assume a<br/>\n50th level player, with 200 in all his combat skills, and 100 STR.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 5 dam/20 delay  weapon will outperform a 10dam/40 delay weapon by about<br/>\n27 percent in a two minute time period, in the primary.  If you have double<br/>\nattack, it goes up to 44 percent, thanks to double the amount of DA<br/>\nactivation checks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will outperform by 39 percent if used in the secondary, mainly thanks to<br/>\ntwice as many DW activation checks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your class is capable of &#39;quad&#39; attacks (see above),  it goes up to a<br/>\nstaggering 73 percent overall spread between the faster and the slower<br/>\nweapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this is an extreme example, most real world weapons aren&#39;t that<br/>\npolarized.  But you can still expect a marked advantage over the faster<br/>\nweapon.  Enough of an advantage to even sacrifice some small amount of<br/>\nefficiency in favor of speed.  A well balanced scimitar, (5 dam/21 delay,<br/>\n.238 eff rating), outdoes a barbed leather whip,( 7 dam/28 delay, .25 eff<br/>\nrating), by 14 percent in a two minute period used as the primary, and 19<br/>\npercent as the secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 50th level, in pure melee combat, two minutes is pretty close to how long<br/>\na typical fight lasts.  Drop the time period down to one minute, the gap<br/>\nnarrows, but is still evident.  Drop it down to 30 seconds, it&#39;s a dead<br/>\nheat, still.  Anything less than 30 seconds tends to favor the whip.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can run this trend down all the way to 17th level for a bard, and the<br/>\ncorresponding skill levels, the spread remains the same for primary weapons,<br/>\nand reaches it&#39;s narrowest point with secondary, but it&#39;s still within 10<br/>\npercent of the peak spread.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, by the way, totally disregards the target&#39;s defense, assuming a<br/>\nrandomized hit with every swing.  If you factor in the highly variable<br/>\nfactors of target defense and AC, first you go nuts, then you come up with<br/>\nresults even more in favor of the faster weapon, as you get more chances to<br/>\nhit as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some cases, though,  where the raw damage numbers DO matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting mobs with damage shields(druids, fire elementals, etc), it&#39;s best<br/>\nto use a slower, heavier damage weapon, to minimize the damage YOU take.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a  Rogue, your backstab damage is predicated on the amount of normal<br/>\nmelee damage you can inflict with one hit, as backstab is simply a fixed<br/>\nmultiplier(based on skill and level) on a normally resolved pierce attack.<br/>\nHigher the base number, the bigger the backstab.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take a look at the good 2h weapons, you&#39;ll find they are generally<br/>\n*much* more efficient than a 1h weapon, by as much as 100 percent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey HAVE to be, to make up for being so much slower than the 1h<br/>\ncounterparts, and to compete with dual wield.  2h weapons, especially 2h<br/>\nslash, are purpose designed to be the most efficient weapons in the game.<br/>\nThey don&#39;t break the above results, at all, but the natural efficiency<br/>\nbrings the curve around again, offsetting reduced attack chances.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for using such a large chunk of bandwidth, this was never intended to<br/>\nbe such a lengthy thread on my part, simply an interjection, and a lot of it<br/>\nwas due to perhaps less than clear language from me.  This is my attempt to<br/>\ncorrect that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, June 14, 1999 10:01 AM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Not really Bard specific<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Oh I completely agree, most of what he says is spot on.  But<br/>\n&gt;&gt; this was just plain wrong.  :-)  He was considering only one<br/>\n&gt;&gt; attribute (weapon speed) when slecting the best weapon to have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in your second hand.  While I agree speed is of overriding<br/>\n&gt;&gt; importance if you&#39;re trying to rapidly increase the dual wield<br/>\n&gt;&gt; skill, once you have it maxed it&#39;s damage rate you want to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; maximize.  Damage rate is determined by speed *and* damage, so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the rule of &quot;fastest weapon&quot; does not apply any more. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
