Sure, I say, let me learn<br/>\na few appropriate songs (Chords, etc) and I&#39;ll equip the Lute.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do pretty well at reavers, but I notice my hand-to-hand skill never moves.<br/>\nEventually we get into a bad situation (or more correctly, a bad situation<br/>\nis delivered to us by another player) and I switch over to Longsword and Dirk.<br/>\nImmediatly I start getting skill-ups in Offense, Dual Wield, etc (I had just<br/>\nrecently made 19th and spent the session before making the cross-country run<br/>\nto get Clouding).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it seems that you don&#39;t get any chance to increase your skills (hand-to-<br/>\nhand or any other offensive skills) when using the Lute.  As far as I could<br/>\ntell, you don&#39;t increase in Dodge or Defense either...<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter realizing that I switched over to pure hand-to-hand, thinking that the<br/>\nLute was the problem.  I still didn&#39;t notice any skill-ups, but I didn&#39;t<br/>\nfight very long this way before giving up (without the Lute it was hard to<br/>\ntake down the reavers).  Perhaps I didn&#39;t see any skill-ups because my hand-<br/>\nto-hand skill is pathetically low to begin with?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone with more experience in the support-bard role have any tips for a<br/>\nbattle-bard?  I was pretty impressed at how effective I am at higher levels<br/>\nwith just songs...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Luvas of Fennin Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
