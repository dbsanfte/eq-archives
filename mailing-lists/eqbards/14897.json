Not certain if it warrants <br/>\n&gt;posting a correction to the thread.  You listed Lullaby as the level 16 <br/>\n&gt;song.  Its the level 15 song.  Level 16 is the underwater breathing song.  <br/>\n&gt;I would hope Verant knew you were talking about the level 15 song but you <br/>\n&gt;never know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>New response from Verant:<br/>\n<br/>\nExtensive in-house testing has revealed that the 16th bard song, Tarew&#39;s <br/>\nAquatic Ayre, is working exactly as designed.
