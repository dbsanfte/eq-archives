Would like a response<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; + Added stat and other bonuses to instruments<br/>\n&gt; Where? None of my instrument stats changed for the better IE: <br/>\n&gt; Bonus? means<br/>\n&gt; something added, right?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; + Added more Class Specific Quests<br/>\n&gt; Lambent. How about some more? Instruments and such. as it is, <br/>\n&gt; besides The<br/>\n&gt; lambent, bards have some pretty poor quests. (4 I think)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; + Added more Class Specific Items<br/>\n&gt; Again, We have very few class specific items. I think they <br/>\n&gt; added a grand<br/>\n&gt; total of 5<br/>\n&gt; Look at warriors. They have millions;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; + Corrected Bug that let monsters attack you from far <br/>\n&gt; distances through your<br/>\n&gt; pet<br/>\n&gt; Didnt know this was an issue, since charm only lasts ten seconds<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; + Added Addition Effects to Some Bard Songs<br/>\n&gt; Forgot to mention that Levitate will not work now. Would like <br/>\n&gt; to know what<br/>\n&gt; effects were added<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; + Added New Bard Songs<br/>\n&gt; New bard songs?, or do you mean, fixed ones that didn&#39;t work?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; + Added Ability for Bards to Punch &#39;Magic Only&#39; Creatures<br/>\n&gt; I thought I could always do this, with magic gloves<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; + Increased the Power of Some Bard Songs (c.f. Chant Series,<br/>\n&gt; Fifil&#39;s, etc.)<br/>\n&gt; Hmm, I have not seen any &quot;Increase&quot; in power of bard songs, <br/>\n&gt; only a decrease<br/>\n&gt; (IE Lullaby, Lament, Pixie strike, Selo&#39;s) Shouldn&#39;t there be <br/>\n&gt; a negative in<br/>\n&gt; here?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
