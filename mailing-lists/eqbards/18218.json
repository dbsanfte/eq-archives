But<br/>\nfirst, we mostly did Mountain Giants last night.  We saw a number of new items including a ring AC10 +10<br/>\nStrength, a tunic called tree weave AC25 +10 strength wearable by just about EVERY class and race except<br/>\npure nukers (mages/necros/wiz).  My wife&#39;s warrior got the ring which goes great with her Efreeti ring on<br/>\nher other hand.  Another warrior got the tunic.  The tunic looks like leather so it is hilareous to see<br/>\nthis warrior running around in all crafted and a leather BP.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe necro stuff is a Flayed Skin Tunic, AC 16 -2 charisma, +5 to all protect,  +20 hp nec and shadow only<br/>\nand the bracer was AC6 -2 char, +5 int, +5 all prot shadow and necro only I believe.  The key though is<br/>\nthey could not be worn by gnomes or inkies.  I believe they are both human/euradite only.  Both items<br/>\nwere looted almost back to back in Karnor.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Cyr, Thierry&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; What are the necro items you got? where and off what? i play a necro and am<br/>\n&gt; looking for goodies all the time...
