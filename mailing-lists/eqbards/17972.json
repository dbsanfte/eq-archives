I&#39;m glad to finally see that I&#39;m not the only one have this<br/>\nproblem.  I was scolded by the list for having put the song away so recently<br/>\nI pulled it back out and found that it still pretty much renders me useless<br/>\nfor anything but chaining when I become runner control.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy level is 48 and I noticed the problem &quot;again&quot; this past week on anything<br/>\nfrom green/blue GKs in Sol B (not sure what level they are?) to Seafury<br/>\nCyclops (con blue) to Ogre Guards in Oggok (con green now mostly) to Fire<br/>\nImps on the Efreeti raid (also con blue).  I&#39;m really surprised that more of<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t having problems with the duration of chains.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharm?  I&#39;d say it lasts for the full 3 ticks 90% of the time for me, Mez? I<br/>\nwas mezing 3 Bats at Sol A zone in Sol B with no problems most of the<br/>\ntime... only problem I&#39;ve ever had with mez was the initial resists and<br/>\nthese got much much lower with full charisma gear on.  Fear?  hehe, only use<br/>\nit in duels these days and it ALWAYS seems to stick the full duration on<br/>\nPCs...<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 48th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAvoid the lines and visit avis.com for quick and easy online <br/>\nreservations.
