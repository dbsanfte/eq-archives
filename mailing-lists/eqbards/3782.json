There are no player-owned structures,<br/>\nthere are no player-owned merchants, there are no item sinks,<br/>\nand there are very few money sinks (trade skills, steel armor)<br/>\nmost of which (trade skills) were an afterthought coded in<br/>\njust before the game went Final.  In short, there really isn&#39;t<br/>\nmuch you can *do* in EQ which doesn&#39;t revolve around killing<br/>\nmonsters to gain items and experience.  You can&#39;t really make<br/>\nyour mark on the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PvP and Racewar servers definitely have more<br/>\npossibilities, but on the normal servers, socializing is not<br/>\nmuch different from an IRC chat room.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that respect, UO is ahead of EQ.  I think EQ only strived<br/>\nto make massively multiplayer online hack and slash FRPG.  UO<br/>\nstrived to make an online virtual world.  In the discussions<br/>\nBrad McQuaid and Raph Koster have had, it&#39;s pretty obvious EQ<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have as high a goal as UO.  Brad still refuses to admit<br/>\nthat long-term money and item sinks are necessary in a<br/>\npersistent online game, to keep player ability inflation (and<br/>\nthus monster difficulty deflation) in check.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
