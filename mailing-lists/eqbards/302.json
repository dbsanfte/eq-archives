Perhaps it works on some creatures and not others, based on their AI or<br/>\nsomething.  When fighting Gearheart, for example, putting him to sleep and moving<br/>\naway has worked like a charm for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKyle wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ksibbald@...\">ksibbald@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         The first thing I did when I got this song was to test this very thing.<br/>\n&gt; Picking on one of the Splitpaw gnolls in South Karana, I put one to sleep<br/>\n&gt; with my song and quickly evacuated the area. I was well clear when it awoke<br/>\n&gt; again but it still came after me.

If<br/>\n&gt; you are the sort of person that it gets mad at normally, and you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; still around when the song wears off, it will get mad at you again.  If<br/>\n&gt; it helps you anyway, think of it as waking up and thinking that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; attacking you for the first time again.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In theory, you should be able to start singing this song, put things<br/>\n&gt; around you to sleep, then run away quickly so that when they wake up,<br/>\n&gt; they will have forgotten about you and go on their merry way.  In<br/>\n&gt; practice, not only for the reasons listed above, this is tricky to<br/>\n&gt; achieve.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jyzan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; You can now easily share photos and documents with your fellow list members<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out our homepage for details on how to use our new shared files<br/>\n&gt; feature!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription<br/>\n&gt; to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> and<br/>\n&gt; select the Member Center link from the menu bar on the left. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
