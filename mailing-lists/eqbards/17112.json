All you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could do was make decisions that best improved your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probability of success<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Go roll a bard on a PvP server or younger server.

I&#39;ve already done all that, made those<br/>\ndecisions and adjustments countless times, and figured out<br/>\nnear-optimal solutions.  Starting a twink would just be<br/>\ntreading the same ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference between playing a bard at 25-40, and playing<br/>\none at 45+ is staggering.  I don&#39;t mind that a class&#39;<br/>\nstrengths can change a bit as you level, but when you lose<br/>\nwholesale abilitites it becomes a non-sequitor.  I&#39;m for the<br/>\nmost part unable to do any of the things that made the bard<br/>\nfun in the mid-levels.  (I&#39;d say more, but then this would<br/>\nturn into a gripe against level and class based systems...)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
