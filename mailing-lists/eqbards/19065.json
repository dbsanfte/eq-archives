I arrived 1 bubble from level 15 and left 2 bubbles<br/>\ninto level 16 after 2 evenings in Lake of Ill Omen.  It was a great<br/>\nplace for exp, especially since it wasn&#39;t even slightly crowded. (I&#39;m<br/>\nused to making one level a week, not one a night!) We (3 of us)<br/>\nbasically had the entire west side of the river to ourselves, fighting<br/>\nmostly non agressive mobs (the sabertooths conned ready to attack, but<br/>\nI had them walk right through me on several occasions without aggroing<br/>\non us - very strange).  On the downside, the loot was so so, excluding<br/>\nthe occasional sabertooth fang, which sold for nearly 2pp each.<br/>\n<br/>\nTravelling from Firiona Vie to the lake wasn&#39;t too bad, with a SoW or<br/>\nSelo&#39;s.  Just followed the northeast shore, and then the river to the<br/>\nlake.  One time I managed to aggro 2 or 3 mobs (spiders, goblins?) on<br/>\nthe way, but they still did minimal damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne lesson learned was made during the trip back.  After zoning to the<br/>\nTimorous Deep, the boat makes 2 stops, not 1.  The first stop brings a<br/>\nshuttle for an elven outpost, the 2nd is for Butcherblock.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\nrecall any stops on the trip from Butcherblock to Firiona Vie, so at<br/>\nthe first stop I got on the shuttle.  I then had to wait on the<br/>\nshuttle, next to a dock until the next boat came, all the while<br/>\nwondering if there were 2 boats.  Finally another boat came, I got on<br/>\nand got off again at the next stop - happy to be back in Faydwer, for<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAdagia, Bard of 16 songs<br/>\nLuclin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
