Although I always enjoy this type of<br/>\n&gt;discussion, I think we will have to wait until the expansion comes out<br/>\n&gt;before we will know what Verant has in store for the bards and other<br/>\n&gt;classes.  Its too bad that Verant is tight lipped when it comes to<br/>\n&gt;discussion of class mechanics.  In addition to new songs, I am hoping that<br/>\n&gt;we will get new skills like parry and riposte (with caps high enough to be<br/>\n&gt;useful) at some point after 50th level.  If the only thing we get are <br/>\n&gt;raises<br/>\n&gt;to the caps of our current skills, then I for one will be quite<br/>\n&gt;disappointed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t know how useful it would be, but maybe the bard community (mailing<br/>\n&gt;list and Concert Hall board) should bang heads together and come up with a<br/>\n&gt;list of song ideas and skills that we would like to see get added with the<br/>\n&gt;expansion.  The way I interpreted GZ&#39;s response to our questions, Verant<br/>\n&gt;seems to be having a hard time coming up with new song ideas.  Maybe we<br/>\n&gt;could help them out some.
