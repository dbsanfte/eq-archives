Last weekend her call to purchase a Dirk in Crushbone was<br/>\n&gt;finally answered, and last night she earned the right to scribe the<br/>\n&gt;12th song.  She&#39;s currently calling E. Freeport home, and she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;finding the adventures there entertaining, but she has suddenly found<br/>\n&gt;herself without any burning immediate goals.  What excitement waits<br/>\n&gt;for a Bard of 12 songs?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oops, one more. I LOVED hunting Blackburrow at 12, it is also great money<br/>\nand exp. Selo&#39;s works (thank goodness as it is train central). make sure to<br/>\nturn in all your gnoll fangs in Qeynos and then trade in the gems you get<br/>\nfor that for beer *grin* It makes gnoll fangs worth about 2 gold each as<br/>\nwell as good Quenos faction. That is all the hint you need to either figure<br/>\nout the quests yourself or look em up on a spoiler site. Also, I THINK I<br/>\nkilled Gnasher for the first time around 12, not certain though, another<br/>\ngood quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
