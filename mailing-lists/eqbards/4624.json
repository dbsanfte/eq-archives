My friend tinen (lvl 41 bard) got the<br/>\narms since we where randoming everything that was obtained between the<br/>\nclasses that could use them. Me and tinen nearly fell over laughing when we<br/>\nfound the first bard only item since we where the only 2 bards. But alas,<br/>\nhe got the first item, and we didnt find anymore for the night since we<br/>\ngated out shortly after that. All of this was on the first day, before they<br/>\nmade it supposedly harder. The next day an elite (snicker) team went in to<br/>\nrez all the bodies that had accumulated from the day before from people who<br/>\njust zoned in and started exploring. Me (for the corpse location song), a<br/>\nlvl 50 cleric, and a lvl 45 druid would take one person at a time in and<br/>\nrez and evac them out. We never got jumped once we entered the gate, we<br/>\ncould stand as long as we wanted to by the gate and nothing would attack<br/>\nus. Several silver backs ran right over me, but never attacked, like they<br/>\nwhere not even agro. We did not engage anything however since we where just<br/>\nhelping people get their corpses back. This was AFTER the zone broadcast<br/>\nthat they had made the zone even rougher... so i dont know for sure what is<br/>\nexactly harder, though i have heard rumors of beasts hitting for 200 and<br/>\nbackstabbing for 500. We keep trying to get another expedition going but<br/>\nall the high lvl clerics went up and went on vacation :p<br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow we are hoping to have 3 45+ clerics and if so its off to the fear<br/>\nplane for us. One tactic i highly recommend: Get a zone wall to your back<br/>\nas soon as possible. That cuts down on a whole 180 degrees that you do not<br/>\nhave to watch. A corner is even better. We tried fighting from the hill by<br/>\nthe gate and its just not a good idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, just about every freaking item we got was no drop. Scratch that.<br/>\nEVERY item we got was no drop, and we got at least 5 items if not more. I<br/>\ndont pay any attention unless i want it :).  Except for those monk only<br/>\ngloves that gave serpentvision, i play a human bard and would LOVE those, i<br/>\nhate turning into a de everytime i want ultravision.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concordan, lvl 48 bard of Tunare<br/>\nWho cant wait to get back to the fear plane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
