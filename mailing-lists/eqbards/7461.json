The<br/>\nway these two mix is often difficult to understand, which is<br/>\nwhy people always ask whether you should sing Hymn during<br/>\ncombat, or why the DDD/CoD/Hymn combo works better than<br/>\nweapons in some cases but not others.  Better offense kills<br/>\nmobs faster (shortens the fight).  Better defense lets you<br/>\nsurvive longer (lengthens the duration you can survive a<br/>\nfight).<br/>\n<br/>\nNot being good at tanking (defense) doesn&#39;t mean you have to<br/>\navoid melee (offense).  You just have to fiddle around with<br/>\nyour song taunt effects so that the mobs usually end up<br/>\nattacking the true tanks.  While our area effect DoTs can do<br/>\nbetter than our weapons in certain situations, most of the<br/>\ntime our weapons are the best way to contribute to the group<br/>\n(with songs sung).  If we get into a situation where more<br/>\ndefense is required (magic resist, more healing), then I&#39;ll<br/>\nswitch to instruments and stand back.  If we need to kill a<br/>\nmob quick though (e.g. spawn coming up), I&#39;m right in there<br/>\nwith my blades.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost classes don&#39;t get this choice.  They just fight and let<br/>\nthe random number generator determine the outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
