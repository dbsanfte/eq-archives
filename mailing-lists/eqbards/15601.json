I get loads of crazy  requests from people.<br/>\nSometimes they start out: what items do you need for Lambent Helm?  Followed<br/>\nby: do you have any for sale?  Then: can you come help me get one?  This is<br/>\nfrom people totally out of the blue &lt;no pun intended&gt; and then I go /anon<br/>\n&lt;sigh&gt;.  &quot;Sorry, I am kinda tied up here with these Fire Giants and cant<br/>\ncome help you right now....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut any how - keep talking to the guides and GM and be calm and nice but<br/>\npersistent.  They can restore you to a point prior to your incident.  There<br/>\nis a lot of discretionary room for guides and gm&#39;s.  Keep talking to them<br/>\nand eventually you should get some help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to see someone who is a real life attorney or has some bucks to<br/>\nhire one go after these loot item stealers.  Subpoena Verant for the real<br/>\nlife name of the loot thief and file both criminal charges and civil suit.<br/>\nThat sot&#39;s local newspapers would have a field day with a story like that.<br/>\nThe thieves (and/or the farmer&#39;s) have established &quot;real - life&quot; value of<br/>\nthese items by selling them for cash on e-bay.  &quot;Your honor and esteemed<br/>\nmembers of the jury, I beg your patience in this matter but I must show you<br/>\nwhat grievous mental anguish my client would suffer if she were to have to<br/>\nendure another Ykesha camp.  Now this may take a few hours so get<br/>\ncomfortable and watch....And remember she had TWO of the items stolen!  OMG!<br/>\nLord with a Sword!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s only a matter of time before this will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, be nice but persistent and stay in contact with your guides<br/>\nand GM&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 02, 2000 11:09 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] &lt;-------idiot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, I did report it and was told there was nothing that could be (or<br/>\nwould<br/>\n&gt; be) done about the situation.  However, at the end of the night, the gm<br/>\n&gt; finally asked that I write her an email explaining the situation.<br/>\nHopefully<br/>\n&gt; that will help matters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The character who actually stole it was Razel, although he said it was his<br/>\n&gt; &quot;friend&quot; Bonewalker who was playing Razel and stole the items.  I am told<br/>\n&gt; that Razel is actually a good guy and was taken advantage of as well but I<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t know what to believe. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
