The first was against the named bandit that hangs out in <br/>\nNorth Karana.  Using lullaby I was able to easily take him out.  I killed <br/>\nhim a second time using fear/chain, this is another great combo for nix&#39;ing <br/>\ncasters.   The other was I was exploring solo in Permafrost using the <br/>\ninvisibility song.  and of course the song blinked on me (I hate that).  So <br/>\nthis Goblin Evoker starts nuking me into tomorrow, by the time I got to him <br/>\nand switch to my weapons I was down below half health.  I started Lullaby <br/>\nand started beating on him. I was actually winning, pounding on him and <br/>\ninterrupting his spells.  But when he ran my first chain failed and he was <br/>\nable to call in help, they made quick work of me :(  Good thing I was bound <br/>\nin Halas.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: DreamKing &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drmking@...\">drmking@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a caster!
