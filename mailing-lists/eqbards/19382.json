They are excellent players - mid<br/>\n50&#39;s and great equipment, etc. etc.  I heard they had gone in Sat night as<br/>\nwell and cleared to the lair.  By the time we finished, cleared our way to<br/>\nthe teleport out and were divving up sellables  - a few of their team<br/>\nstarted appearing at the orb:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Trakanon - ouch!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We got owned!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Somehow we agro&#39;d him and he wasted us.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;He teleported me to some room filled with &#39;shrooms!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were working the lower level and were not really intending to fight the<br/>\ndragon but I guess he got mad at them and showed them his powers.  Grats to<br/>\nLoD - they are the first I know of on our server (Inny) to brave the lower<br/>\nlevels of &quot;Even Lower Guk&quot; and other than one odd dragon encounter I think<br/>\nthat they were doing quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, I finished the Jarsath Medallion Quest - one of three<br/>\nneeded for getting the key to Veeshan&#39;s Peak.  You need to kill the ancient<br/>\njarsath in Firona Vie, the bloodgill maurader that guards the gates to the<br/>\nunderwater zone in Lake of Ill Omen, and find the piece in the Swamp of No<br/>\nHope. Then off to Timourus Deep and the archeologist.  Give him 3 pieces and<br/>\nhe makes the medal.  Gives it back to you because &quot;oh my! I feel this is<br/>\ncursed! here take it back!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get a key to Veeshan&#39;s Peak, you need the 3 medals (each requires 3 sub<br/>\npieces) and &#39;proof of Trakanon&#39;s demise.&#39; So, I have to wonder, will Trak<br/>\ndrop one &quot;proof&quot; item each time or will he drop multiples.  If you have to<br/>\nkill Trak one time for each person that needs a key and you want to take 36<br/>\npeople to Veeshan&#39;s..... well, you can see, it&#39;s going to be a while before<br/>\nppl start seeing Veeshan&#39;s.  Heck, it&#39;s looking like Trak is going to be a<br/>\nreal challenge on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nMinstrel somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I dinged 52 finally - soloing in Dreadlands.  Then made almost a bub<br/>\nfor 6 hours of fighting to, from & in the Disco Room.  And Nillipus March of<br/>\nthe Wee - played with Selos Drums adds 33 AC!  I have been trying to play it<br/>\nat the outset of combat.  At least folks can benefit on the first hit.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s. The enchanter in our group got &quot;Theft of Thought&quot; last night.  He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t think he will ever have to med again - heh.  It&#39;s spell that<br/>\ntransfers mana to him from the target.  Until the next patch, any target -<br/>\npost-patch, only caster mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 02, 2000 2:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: Trakanon was [eqbards] Bard Armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Out of curiosity, has anyone fought Trakanon?
