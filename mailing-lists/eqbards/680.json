Also, bard songs have some special &quot;Side Effects&quot; at<br/>\ntimes.<br/>\nSome of these can be useful, some can be lethal. For example:<br/>\n<br/>\nInvisibility - Having it cast on you while you are already playing a song<br/>\nmakes you SEEM<br/>\n                   to be invisible. However, song effects are still visible<br/>\nto both PCs and monsters.<br/>\n                   I recently saw an &quot;invisible&quot; bard playing Hymn of<br/>\nRestoration attempt to walk thru<br/>\n                   an Orc Legionaire encampment. The walk back to recover<br/>\nhis corpse was much<br/>\n                   longer than the walk through the camp. Everything in the<br/>\ncamp attacked him the<br/>\n                   instant he walked in. He remained invisible thru the<br/>\nmoment when he switched songs<br/>\n                   to attempt the Accelerando to escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoot - While playing the Accelerando, root and similar spells that generate<br/>\nthe &quot;BOOT&quot; icon will<br/>\n            have no effect on you. However I DID manage to get a cumulative<br/>\neffect from SoW in<br/>\n            a situation where I was low on stamina and already playing the<br/>\nAccelerando. SoW sped<br/>\n            me to aproximately the speed I would have were I not low on<br/>\nstamina and still playing the<br/>\n           Accelerando.<br/>\n<br/>\nSwimming - While playing the Accelerando and swimming you do not lose<br/>\nstamina and do appear<br/>\n                      to actually swim faster. For a laugh, equip your drum<br/>\nand play the Accelerando while<br/>\n                     swimming. The animation with the drum is a standing<br/>\none, and is played even when<br/>\n                     swimming, so that you can appear to actually &quot;Walk on<br/>\nWater&quot; #)<br/>\n<br/>\nEncumbered - If you are playing any of the strength enhancing songs, be<br/>\ncareful that you pay attention<br/>\n                         to your NORMAL encumbrance level as well as the one<br/>\nyou have with the song. If you can<br/>\n                         carry 80 without the song, and 90 with the song,<br/>\nyou don&#39;t want to be carrying 85 lbs of<br/>\n                         equipment and have to flee from a combat since, if<br/>\nyou are stunned or you switch to the<br/>\n                         Accelerando to escape you instantly become<br/>\nencumbered and may no longer be able to<br/>\n                         run away, even with the Accelerando playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nChasing - If you have that monster nearly killed and can&#39;t quite catch him<br/>\nto kill him, occasionally Kelin&#39;s<br/>\n                  Lugubrious Lament will cause a fleeing monster to stop.<br/>\nThis only works until you actually hit<br/>\n                  the creature, and it will not work on a monster that has<br/>\nceased to flee and has turned to charge<br/>\n                  you again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Almost all classes have a cap of 94 in Hand to Hand, monks being the<br/>\n&gt; exception.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Using an instrument in lieu of a weapon in combat at later levels is like,<br/>\n&gt; well, cutting off your hand.  There&#39;s times when it&#39;s useful, but for the<br/>\n&gt; most part, you&#39;re better off taking advantage of the fact that you hit<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and hard, with 1h weapons, and can dual wield.  If you wish to play a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nearly<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; passive support bard,  I wish you luck.  While your songs are a great aid<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the party, most would prefer you loan your blade skills as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I have found at least ONE circumstance where playing an instrument<br/>\nin combat is more useful than using a weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nTRAIN CONTROL<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a hoarde of monsters has been dragged into an area by some poor fool,<br/>\nplaying an area effect damage song with its accompanying instrument while<br/>\nhaving a couple of allies run interference for you can be a good way to<br/>\neliminate a train that would otherwise be difficult to slay.<br/>\nWhile your allies block some of the monsters direct attention on you, you<br/>\ncan damage the entire train. Once the train has taken significant damage<br/>\nit&#39;s time to switch to a weapon and begin to pick them off one by one. At<br/>\nthe very least this method can keep a large number of fleeing<br/>\npeople from getting killed. If you are in a narrow spot and EVERYTHING is<br/>\nmad at you, only SOME of them can get to you, giving others a chance to<br/>\nescape. I recently did this in BlackBurrow and then when everyone had fled,<br/>\nJumped and hopped my way across the shoulders of more than 20 gnolls in<br/>\norder to escape. I wish I&#39;d gotten a screenshot of that one. #(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
