I have to disagree with<br/>\nthe Kunark Loot part though.  I think they fixed the yard trash drops<br/>\nthankfully, and some of the stuff is pretty over the top, but don&#39;t get me<br/>\nstarted on No Drop.  I hate No Drop so much I could puke.  If all the good<br/>\nstuff was No Drop I could flush all my plat down the toilet right now cause<br/>\nthere would be nothing to spend it on.  Lets keep No Drop for quest items<br/>\nand I think it will all work out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Kurnark Loot:<br/>\nI HATE it not being NODROP most of all, but also I HATE soloable yard trash<br/>\nat the zone line dropping stuff better than stuff my guild spend MONTHS<br/>\n/played in planes for and I HATE the Monty Haul stats.  I had a really long<br/>\nrant typed out but in the end I deleted because there&#39;s no need to subject<br/>\nyou all to it. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun all and sorry for the novel!<br/>\n-Tork@Nameless</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
