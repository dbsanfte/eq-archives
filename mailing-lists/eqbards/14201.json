Any Mucktail you see kill it.<br/>\n  This will get you Highpass/Qeynos faction.  Once you have enough <br/>\n  Highpass faction, go to Highkeep and buy goblin ears off people for<br/>\n  a few plats, this will up your standing with the Freeport Militia <br/>\n  significantly.  If you&#39;ve every killed a Freeport guard or helped<br/>\n  your Pally friend out with Lucan, you can probably forget about <br/>\n  ever going across the Commons / Freeport without training guards.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m sure there are other Freeport raising factions, but this<br/>\n  accomplishes all three human cities at once.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
