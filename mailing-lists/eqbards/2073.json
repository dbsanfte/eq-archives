If you get a drum and use<br/>\nthat while singing Accelerando you will pass the little fellows in a jiffy<br/>\nhowever.  I too am a wood elf and blaze by them with my drum, but lag behind<br/>\nwithout.

I&#39;ve been travelling with a level 8 halfling<br/>\ndruid friend of mine, and whether singing or not, she outruns me by a long<br/>\nshot.  At the time we were both stripped of everything (multi-zone trip, so<br/>\nall posessions went into the bank) and she had not cast any buffs on either<br/>\nof us.  Are wood elves/bards naturally slower than halflings/druids?  I<br/>\nspent some time hunting in Mysty (just long enough that I was ready to<br/>\nattack the guards for killing every mob within an 8 mile radius of the wall<br/>\njust when I had them down to their last breath!) and noticed that while<br/>\nrunning with Accelerado I was still getting passed by others (presumably<br/>\nusing SOW).  Anyone care to shed some light on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nTa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet involved.
