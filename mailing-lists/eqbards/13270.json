A mage who wants to learn group tactics (and they can be<br/>\nreal benefits in a group if played well) has a very hard time.  Problem<br/>\n1: Having the ability to solo through 20 easily and beyond there still<br/>\nfairly well is a dangerous temptation.  Especially when you consider how<br/>\nfrustrating pickup groups can be.  (this is not a real excuse though)<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem 2:  Since there is so much talk about how much mages suck in<br/>\ngroups (including how pets suck up xp, if you think the jig requests are<br/>\nbad see how many people insist that your pet is hurting their xp), no<br/>\none wants to group with them.  My second char was a mage and I almost<br/>\nNEVER could find a group.  The prejudice against mages is huge.  Which<br/>\nis a shame because I&#39;m pretty convinced they can outdamage a wizard in a<br/>\ngood group (though no evac hurts). <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the same thread, I was with the same two (enchanter and shaman) again<br/>\nlast night.  Most of the night, wisely we decided a buffed up Elfson<br/>\n(Thats me, 15 bard) was better than a crap shoot tank.  They also<br/>\nencuraged me to experiment with songs since we were a pretty unstandard<br/>\ngroup.  It actually seemed that just continous Discord was our best<br/>\nbet.  (Bellow was almost always resissted by DW crocs).  In any case it<br/>\nwas fun to be tank for a night, I had more than a full column of buffs. <br/>\n(Most of the night we bough resolution for me from friendly clerics,<br/>\nusually traded a set of shaman buffs for cleric buffs).  I think I had<br/>\n115 str and 550 hp which is pretty cool for a lvl 15 bard...  Only one<br/>\ndeath all night too, and that was when the enchantress was talking to<br/>\nher mom and missed all my &quot;SG near&quot;, &quot;SG Approaching!&quot; &quot;SG!&quot; &quot;SG!&quot; &quot;SG!&quot;<br/>\nmessages.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
