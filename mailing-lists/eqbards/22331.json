I have no evidence to support this practice as the only times I<br/>\ngroup with a monk is on big raids (where you dont want to sing on the pull<br/>\nanyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nI good song to keep mobs off healers/enchanters is Melodic Binding.<br/>\nAssuming you dont have a shaman slowing, this songs is great.  Its slows and<br/>\nac-debuffs the Mob, doesn&#39;t break mez, and taunts them onto you.  While we<br/>\naren&#39;t tanks, its hella better for the extra mobs to be beating on you then<br/>\nthe enchanter or cleric.  OUr guild&#39;s main enchanter (who I am often in<br/>\ncommunication with on guild raids) estimates this song moakes her about 25%<br/>\nmore effective at mezzing mobs.  Mostly because she doesn&#39;t have to stun<br/>\nbefore mezzing and if things go badly (multiple resists/lag usually) she is<br/>\nin much less danger of dying (and to be honest if things go bad, I&#39;d rather<br/>\njust me dies then multiple deaths including the cleric, if just I die, as<br/>\nsoon as the fights over, rezz, mana song, and the loss is minimal).  Also<br/>\nfrom a cleric&#39;s perspective (my secondary is cleric), in a group without en<br/>\nanchanter, when I drop my greater heal (lvl 30 group) I WILL agro at least<br/>\none mob on me.  No biggie, stun, root, med. (Actually since we are the same<br/>\ngroup every time we play, the wizard and I trust each other enough to root<br/>\neach others mobs)  BUT, if our bard is their, sining binding, I rarely get<br/>\nan agro, and if I do, I just stand next to her for a pulse or two, then back<br/>\noff.  Much more effecient, and there nothing worse for a cleric than seeing<br/>\na teamate go down, while a mob is interupting your heals.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom both my perspectives, I say a good bard is an enchanters or cleric&#39;s<br/>\nsecond best friend (a good puller is first)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
