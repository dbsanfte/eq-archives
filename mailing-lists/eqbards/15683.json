Once you target a<br/>\n&gt; mob and start a targeted song, you don&#39;t have to keep it<br/>\n&gt; targeted.  You can switch to a different target, attack,<br/>\n&gt; etc. and the Pixie Strike will still hit the mob you had<br/>\n&gt; targeted when you started the song.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
