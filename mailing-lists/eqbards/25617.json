You&#39;ll sing songs and every 30 minutes or so -<br/>\nyou&#39;ll get about 3 ticks of the song - then it will stop working again.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice testing Verant.  A few glitches on release - okay I can live with<br/>\nthat - but completely breaking one of the classes - Way to go!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
