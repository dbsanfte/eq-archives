Now if we could just get some response on the bard song issues.  I<br/>\ndid notice that we are the only hybrid not to get a mana increase<br/>\napparently, wonder if that&#39;s true?  If the hybrid mana mod is just a toggle,<br/>\nbet there&#39;s a whole slew of DDD&#39;s massacres tonight ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure<br/>\ncaster with the same stats.  This will give those hybrids a good deal more<br/>\nmana, regardless of their stats.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Changes/Fixes*<br/>\n<br/>\n- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works<br/>\n- Scaler recipe now works<br/>\n- Elven Wine can now be brewed<br/>\n- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather than<br/>\npelts of quality.
