The 2<br/>\ncleric rule is so one can constantly rotate their 3 or 4 stun spells on him,<br/>\nwhile the other heals.  The only way to pull singly is a level 50 monk who<br/>\nknows how to pull using feign death.  Only tried that once but it worked.<br/>\nOtherwise, need around 12 ppl or 6 or more plus enchanter, preferrably all<br/>\nlevel 45 to 50.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Tim and Mary Steed [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timandmary@...\">timandmary@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 26, 1999 3:49 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] A Request and Thoughts on Rubicite Armor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Tim and Mary Steed&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timandmary@...\">timandmary@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michael (or anyone else),<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Ok, need some advice on the Ghoul Lord.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Our Guild, pretty much nightly, has 6 people levels 35-49 <br/>\n&gt; head down and<br/>\n&gt; clear the whole area UP TO The Ghoul Lord.
