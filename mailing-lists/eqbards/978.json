During the<br/>\n&gt;peak times, this server is near the top, but right near the<br/>\n&gt;bottom during off-times.<br/>\n&gt;As for crowded newbie areas, I have seen none of that problem<br/>\n&gt;around Oggok (Ogre home town).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And my personal opinion is that you must be PvP to role-play<br/>\n&gt;correctly.  Of course, our definitions of role-playing may<br/>\n&gt;differ, and you are free to disagree (may start an interesting<br/>\n&gt;thread on just what is role-playing).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also find that a good number of people I have encountered are<br/>\n&gt;role-playing to a certain degree.  Not all-out hell-for-leather<br/>\n&gt;role playing, but not just acting themselves, either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess it is easier to role play an Ogre eg.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m out of food and water, going to town to get some.<br/>\n&gt;vs<br/>\n&gt;Me hungry.  Get food.  You want?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rocket<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;See homepage for details.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hehe, ok one of my favorite things when I first started playing EQ was when <br/>\nan ogre or troll roleplays in character. Come to think of it I haven&#39;t many <br/>\nwho don&#39;t. Keeps it fun, that&#39;s for sure. Of course dwarves acting like <br/>\ngrumpy old louts I think are fun too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
