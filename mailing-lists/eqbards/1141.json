As a human with a charisma of 90 I can buy a steel<br/>\nbreastplate in freeport for 700-something plat. I havent checked the prices<br/>\nrecently though, they may have changed it since for some reason. I&#39;ll check up<br/>\non this and see.<br/>\nMay I ask where you purchased it and what race you are?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I recently purchased a steel breastplate.  It was 980 or so platinum at 90<br/>\n&gt; charisma.  Putting on my two +5 charisma items reduced the price by around<br/>\n&gt; 40 plat.  I then got a friendly shaman to cast a charisma buff on me,<br/>\n&gt; bringing my total up to 115; this brought the price down to less than 900<br/>\n&gt; platinum.  Sorry, I don&#39;t remember the exact figures.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
