Server emulators provide us a means to access our<br/>\npaid-for game when Verant cannot or will not.  Otherwise, we are paying $50<br/>\n+ 10/month for coasters.  This is rather like purchasing a car and being<br/>\ntold that you can only drive it on highways - never locally.<br/>\nOther people are building emulators as we speak (if for nothing more than<br/>\nthe challenge of it), and I&#39;m sure that there are even hack-programs being<br/>\nwritten to allow people to alt-tab, etc.  Verant will be hard-pressed to<br/>\nstop all of it, and to be honest, considering some of their recent<br/>\nattitudes toward customers, I have little sympathy.  (cf. Ak&#39;anon Alliance<br/>\nscandal, secret &#39;nerfing&#39;, failure to reimburse for bugs THEY caused.)   I<br/>\nlost a shiny brass shield last night, due to a bug, the ONE &quot;neato&quot; thing I<br/>\n*WORKED* for (I fought that trainer, and fought and fought until I got the<br/>\nshield), only to lose it to a bug.  FYI, never drop a LORE item inside of a<br/>\nbackpack onto the ground.  It goes bye-bye.  I didn&#39;t even bother<br/>\npetitioning it - just logged the bug, then went back to dying in Everfrost<br/>\n(which also annoys me - 5 hours spent looking for the elusive Karg Icebear,<br/>\nonly to find out he only spawns once a day, and then is immediately killed<br/>\nby GZ hunters.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the annoyed Wanderer<br/>\n&lt;The Wandering Minstrels&gt;<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
