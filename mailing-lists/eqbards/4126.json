Twinking has always existed and always will.<br/>\nFor the most part most people dislike it because, like you say, jealousy.<br/>\nBut, there&#39;s also some very detrimental effects to twinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Lazy players - Although it might seem &#39;nice&#39; to give that barbed leather<br/>\nwhip you just upgraded, to a lower level character, this slowly tends to<br/>\nbreed a dependance & you&#39;ll start to see an increase of item/cash beggers.<br/>\nYou also see this occur ALOT with information, slowly as people&#39;s questions<br/>\nare answered with shouts, they tend to become less & less likely to explore<br/>\nand learn for themselves.  Soon you have a spam-load of questions going back<br/>\n& forth & lots of people shouting RTFM.  The preferable method I&#39;ve found<br/>\nfor items to newbies, is more to play secret santa... Upgraded that whip &<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like dealing with the hassle of selling it?  Go give it to a<br/>\nbeetle in the commons, then invis & watch the glee of the newbie who finds<br/>\nit.  The difference here is that they assume the game is giving them an<br/>\nultra rare (which is should do IMHO) instead of a player giving them<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Respect for the game - This one&#39;s VERY hard to put a finger on, but with<br/>\nmost muds there&#39;s a definite learning curve that one must follow to succeed<br/>\nin the game.  By twinking a character you sufficiently flatten out that<br/>\ncurve & as a result new characters will circumvent the &quot;babtism by fire&quot;<br/>\nthat seasoned players had to go through.  An often forgotten about portion<br/>\nof the game, is that whole character building process that you have to go<br/>\nthrough.  Again, in general, what I&#39;ve seen is people who are twinked tend<br/>\nto not &#39;love&#39; & respect the game like those of us that have gone down that<br/>\nhard path, they&#39;re usually more likely to exploit bugs, and not give a rat&#39;s<br/>\narse about the &#39;big picture&#39; of the game.  Unfortunately, The only way for<br/>\npeople to learn this love/respect of the game is to go through it<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nToken Disclaimer:<br/>\nThese are pretty extreme overall generalities, please don&#39;t infer that I&#39;m<br/>\ncalling you the anti-christ of eq for giving that whip to your buddy because<br/>\nyou want to give him a leg up.  In addition there&#39;s an extreme difference<br/>\nbetween twinking a newbie who hasn&#39;t learned the game yet, and twinking a<br/>\nsecondary character who&#39;s already learned that respect for the game I<br/>\nmentioned.  (Level 1-10 for almost all characters is ABOUT the same, but<br/>\nthen again most people who have played the game alot can burn through the<br/>\n1st ten levels in under 2 days /played, untwinked)<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kyle Q &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kquinby@...\">kquinby@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, July 22, 1999 10:56 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Blackened Iron Armor *SPOILER* (sort of)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kyle Q&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kquinby@...\">kquinby@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry, I just had to reply to this, and then I&#39;ll let the subject drop<br/>\n&gt;forever. Enough has been said about twinking. I have to say, you have to be<br/>\n&gt;a real jerk to give somebody flak because they are twinked. This is called<br/>\n&gt;JEALOUSY folks. Get over it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;IMHO someone totally ruined the game for this guy, and he will never even<br/>\n&gt;&gt;know it.  Not only has the thrill of the loot been taken from him, among<br/>\n&gt;&gt;other things,  *but other players will make his life a hard one because he<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;twinked.*<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;-Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Create a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;...and you can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
