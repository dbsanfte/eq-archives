I know he is a part of 2 quests at<br/>\nleast. I think one is for receiving the Shrine key into Cobalt Scar, and the<br/>\nother I believe is for the Dragon Tooth Choker. Now I want one of these (had<br/>\nto take a faction hit for killing the stupid drake there). Sentry Kale gives<br/>\nyou a note to give to Weng, who&#39;s MIA. Giving what he gives you back must be<br/>\nreturned to Kale, or spawns the spy in Skyshrine in a spot at the base of<br/>\nthe steps that lead up to the higher levels of the shrine. What drops from<br/>\nthe spy is returned to Kale for the Choker, if memory serves me correctly.<br/>\nOK, the question is, where in the heck is wenglaks, why has he been missing<br/>\nfor several patches. People can&#39;t get their shrine key without taking a<br/>\nfaction hit, nor can this quest be completed. Has anyone heard what&#39;s going<br/>\non, or have they moved Weng to another portion of Kael, harder to get to? As<br/>\nit was the guy was relatively close to the zone, although I&#39;m not sure if<br/>\nthe other guys in the room would pounce on you or not. /sigh<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be like the NoS when they moved the loot table to Howling stones<br/>\nfrom Dalnir. They may have just made it a dropped item rather than<br/>\nquested....<br/>\n<br/>\nPava<br/>\nCT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
