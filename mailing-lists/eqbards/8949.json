On a few occasions, we would also fight mobs that were green<br/>\nto me but blue to the druid.  When we killed then, I did not receive<br/>\nexperience points but he did.  Lets assume that when we killed a crag<br/>\nspider, I got 55% of the total experience and he got 45% due to our level<br/>\ndifference.  When we killed the mobs that gave me no experience, did he get<br/>\n100% or 45%?  I would guess he only got 45% but want to get a confirmation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
