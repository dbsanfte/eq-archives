(unless it&#39;s bard-only)<br/>\n<br/>\n2 cloak of flames dropped off nagafen last time (i wasn&#39;t there or i<br/>\nwould&#39;ve known about this sooner) and bards were excluded in the lotto.  no<br/>\nmore runed bolster belts will be going to bards either.  (fbss only likely<br/>\none now, and only then if no other guild members that need it are in group<br/>\naccording to guild rules)<br/>\n<br/>\ni need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a guild of 150+<br/>\ndifferent players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>\n<br/>\ni tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but the leaders of the guild<br/>\nare pretty sure that since bards have haste songs, they don&#39;t need a haste<br/>\nitem. (even tho they stack)  being a huge guild, the leaders get whines and<br/>\nrants all the time, so our chances of convincing them otherwise is very<br/>\nslim.<br/>\n<br/>\nany ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nChocolate eggs, tulips, bunnies and more...<br/>\nClick Here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3120/7/_/451022/_/955681130/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3120/7/_/451022/_/955681130/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
