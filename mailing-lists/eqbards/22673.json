We can&#39;t really complain that they&#39;ve finally given us a song<br/>\nthey had &quot;no plans for at present&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard people say the angel voice and subsequent message spam gets<br/>\nreally annoying in short order.  In a full group, you&#39;re going to get 6<br/>\nmessages saying &quot;blahblah&#39;s skin is surrounded by a shield of songs&quot; or<br/>\nsomething similar.  Hopefully Verant will remove the message that everyone<br/>\nelse sees when the song takes effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow a question on the mechanics of the song: since it provides a 45pt rune,<br/>\nif a mob hits you for, say, 50pts, then that additional 5 points is also<br/>\nabsorbed?  There&#39;s obviously more useful songs to twist than this alone?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;ll find out myself in 11 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nKyri<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anyway, get it, play with it, and see for yourself.  It seems to be a very<br/>\nuseful song.  So what if it only absorbs 45 dmg or so?  It&#39;s cheap,<br/>\ngroup-wide, refreshes when it pulses, has cool particle effects, makes you<br/>\nsound like a choir of angels (ok, so maybe that&#39;s a drawback), and it<br/>\nrequires NO reagents that I have noticed.  Plus it&#39;s a song where we never<br/>\nhad one before... hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 49 Missed Notes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
