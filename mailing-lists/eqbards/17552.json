At the time I<br/>\nwas worried about Shaman and their healing capabilities, so I had Pixie<br/>\nStrike.  That really wasn&#39;t necessary though.  Also, Tagar&#39;s and other<br/>\nslowdown spells have no affect on you when you go all instruments, which<br/>\nis a huge plus :).<br/>\n\tBTW, your original numbers on damage/second aren&#39;t totally<br/>\naccurate, because you didn&#39;t figure in hand to hand damage.  My hand to<br/>\nhand skill went up at least 10 points last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMiriana<br/>\nLegions of Darkness<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
