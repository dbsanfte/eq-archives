I did maybe 30 corpse recoveries from<br/>\nthe Lava in my time in Sol A (none of them people in my party).<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, it is a bit easier then described.  Most important, you need a<br/>\nlevitate.  If you have to recover someone elses corpse, target it with your<br/>\ncorpse locater song and then step off, hit your /corpse button and<br/>\nimmediately step back onto the stairs.  You should be able to get the corpse<br/>\nonto the stairs before you float down far enough to not be able to get back<br/>\nup.  If it is your corpse you can skip the song/target routine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, see if you can get a guide to pull it out, but in my<br/>\nexperience guides are very poorly kept up on current policy, so I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nexpect help there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther bugs in Sol A other then the &quot;corpse lost in a wall&quot; bug is the<br/>\ninfamous invisability bug where you can&#39;t see some of your party members or<br/>\nthey can&#39;t see you.  This is usually easily fixed by camping or zoning and<br/>\ncoming back.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly if you are in the Safe Room pulling, keep an eye out for &quot;train&quot;<br/>\nmessages from the Bar or from the Kings room.  If someone messes up in<br/>\neither one of those areas, they are quite likely coming your way with<br/>\ninfernos or soluseks in tow.  There is a bridge in the room above the safe<br/>\nroom where we found you can stand and let the train pass beneath you.  When<br/>\nthe train starts heading home, we&#39;d often pull the last 1 or 2 goblins which<br/>\nusually were damaged :-).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Miriana [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, March 06, 2000 1:58 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Level 22 woes (or why Unrest STILL sucks) LONG<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Miriana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tYou&#39;re wrong about guide&#39;s not helping with corpses in lava.
