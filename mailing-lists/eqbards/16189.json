A Necro _does_ have a very long survival<br/>\nrate<br/>\n&gt; in a solo situation because of their PET.  A Necro using a pet wisely can<br/>\n&gt; survive far longer than a solo warrior can in a 1 up fight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basic Necro tactic:<br/>\n&gt; Combat mob<br/>\n&gt; Melee while casting DOT&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Back off, let pet tank while dot&#39;s do work.  Heal up with Health drains<br/>\n&gt; (also dmg opponent)<br/>\n&gt; Drop a few nukes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a group the Necro loses his &#39;long duration&#39; and becomes part of the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;party&#39; duration<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Necro&#39;s can solo incredible npc&#39;s specifically because their pets give<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; a much higher &#39;survival time&#39; than any melee class enjoys.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nnecros<br/>\n&gt; fight npcs far longer than my ranger or my bard can.  Because they can<br/>\nhurt<br/>\n&gt; their oponent while healing themselves and their pet.  Pluss the pet gives<br/>\n&gt; them a &#39;pocket tank&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to dissagree but Necro&#39;s are Awesome solo and only average (actually<br/>\n&gt; slightly below average) in a group.  Necro is one of the LAST classes I<br/>\n&gt; consider when forming a group, even with their new spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lyrnia </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
