I was<br/>\n&gt;fighting Ogre Bouncers inside Oggok last night with my Ykesha and I believe<br/>\n&gt;the number of times it fired over the course of about 4 hours of play was<br/>\n&gt;either 2 or 3 - that&#39;s a very serious drop, perhaps an order of magnitude.<br/>\n&gt;The last hour or so I loaded up all of my DEX equipment and played Chant of<br/>\n&gt;Battle and had a DEX of 186 and didn&#39;t proc once.  After killing Bouncers I<br/>\n&gt;ran over to Cazic-Thule and beat on some lizzies and gators for testing<br/>\n&gt;purposes (also 186 DEX) and got not a single proc while there (around 20<br/>\n&gt;solo kills).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Crier Sharpsong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!  <br/>\n&gt;  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
