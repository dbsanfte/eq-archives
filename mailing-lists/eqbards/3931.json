Used a normal horn.<br/>\nI watched the rat&#39;s health bar drop to the middle point, then drop again and<br/>\nit died.<br/>\nI played with the Minotaur Horn in the same manner.  One &quot;pulse&quot; then<br/>\nwatched the rat.  With the Minotaur horn I did far less damage, and didn&#39;t<br/>\neven kill the rat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re really in the mood, just test in on a friend you duel and write<br/>\ndown the numbers, but I was satisfied just watching how quickly I could kill<br/>\nrats with a normal horn over the minotaur variety.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;None of the brass instrument songs I&#39;ve gotten so far require<br/>\n&gt;that a horn be equipped.
