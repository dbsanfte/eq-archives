It&#39;s useful, but as<br/>\n&gt; one of the &quot;dextrously challenged&quot; I&#39;m also a bit disappointed<br/>\n&gt; since it seems to violate the EQ designer&#39;s statement that &quot;This<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t a twitch game&quot;.  Esp, if what I&#39;m hearing about twisting<br/>\n&gt; being both needed at higher levels, and impacted by connect speed,<br/>\n&gt; graphics, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Part of the many reasons why my Bard sits in storage. My wrists are<br/>\nphysically tired after about an hour of twisting songs. It&#39;s tedious, it&#39;s<br/>\nannoying, and what we get for twisting isn&#39;t worth it. There&#39;s only two<br/>\nthings bards do well, run fast and regen mana for the party. Everything else<br/>\nsome other class does better and easier and with fewer deaths associated<br/>\nwith it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ is the fourth gaming system (paper & pencil and computer) to make bards<br/>\nso close to being fun but then ruining it by making the player (the person<br/>\nplaying the character) do extra work for few extra benefits. I don&#39;t think<br/>\nit&#39;s fixable.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong. I enjoy my bard. I enjoy her because she can run fast...<br/>\ngrouping (or trying to find a group since there are few high level tanks on<br/>\nThe Rathe who will group outside of their guilds) is a grand disappointment.<br/>\nWe do not add much to a party (less downtime, who cares though since you&#39;ll<br/>\nbe waiting on caster mana).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve spent countless hours trying to be a better bard. I know much about the<br/>\nclass. How things work and don&#39;t work. Yet I hop behind any other class and<br/>\nI&#39;m suddenly a 10 times more effective character without even being sure<br/>\nwhat my spells or skills really do. It&#39;s sad... depressing because I wanted<br/>\nmy bard to be so good.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCampaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nDiscuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
