I am<br/>\nhaving to relearn my attack strategies to deal with the lag.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here is a tale of what happened to me a few levels back...<br/>\n<br/>\nI had spent most of time between the 11th and 12th choruses pounding skels<br/>\nin the Steamfront Mountains. It was slow work, but with Hymn and other songs<br/>\nI happily pounded the undead back into the ground, never once seeing the<br/>\nillustrious Mino Hero come out of his cave, but that was all about to<br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly after attaining the 12th level of training I returned to Steamfront<br/>\nto hear the sounds of a group of like level adventures forming a party to go<br/>\ninside the minotaur caves. Thinking that I had advanced enough to safely<br/>\njourney there, I contacted the party leader and made my way there. On<br/>\narriving I was greeted by a group of 5 other adventures all ready for battle<br/>\nand adventure, after a round of buffing by our druid we entered the mouth of<br/>\nthe caves.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce inside we saw that another group had already taken position at a prime<br/>\nlocation at the mouth of the many tunnels. Our group leader suggested<br/>\nfurther in to find some Mino slavers. All the party members being first<br/>\ntimers to these parts agreed, and slowly we ventured farther in. At one of<br/>\nthe many junctions of passageways our leader bade us to stop so that he may<br/>\ngo off and pull some prey back to our intrepid band, with aniticpation we<br/>\nwaited, and then a call from our leader told us to venture forth to his<br/>\nlocation where he had cornered a slaver. With haste we came running to his<br/>\ncall, my groupmates all began to attack the dreaded slaver, but I turning<br/>\nthe corner realized that is was not one slaver we were attacking, but many<br/>\nall occupying the same space, an odd site indeed. I began into the first<br/>\nstanza of Anthem de Arms, to late to stop, only to have what now apperaed to<br/>\nbe five slavers turn to attack me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have be slain by a Minotaur Slaver..<br/>\nLOADING<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly the same fate befell most of my group, some fortunate few had gated<br/>\nthemselves away from the carnage. We all agreed to meet at the cave entrance<br/>\nto begin the task of retrieving our corpses. Upon arriving at the cave<br/>\nentrance, I found that our brave leader had already entered the caves and<br/>\nretrieved his corpse, and was now relaying the dark news that he would be<br/>\ndeparting this world ASAP. Other parties members who had gated and were now<br/>\nhearing this news choose this time to depart our group, begging other<br/>\nengagements and their condolences. With great anger three of the remaining<br/>\ngroup ventured forth under guise of camoflage to get our lost bodies. It was<br/>\nhard and slow work, but with time we all were succesfull.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA sane adventurer would at this point taken off his pack for the evening and<br/>\nreturned to the comforts of Kelethin for a fine ale, but not I.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur group soon found new members, but they were spread across All of Norrath<br/>\nnot knowing the way to the minotaur caves. So with my trusty drum I ran<br/>\nseveral times to where the Steamfront Mountains meet the forest of Lesser<br/>\nFaydark to guide people to our groups location, and it would seem that each<br/>\ntime I did another party member of mine would fall victim to a stray slaver<br/>\nescaped from the caves, or be mobbed by wander earth elementals. Soon I was<br/>\nnot only ferrying new members to the group&#39;s location, but running now<br/>\ndefenseless group members back to their corpses.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn time, a full group of able-bodied and equipped adventures went forth into<br/>\nthe mino caves, the party that had taken post at the mouths of the tunnels<br/>\nwas gone, so I suggested we camp there, but the rest of my party was sorely<br/>\ntired of dying and wanted to hop into the action right away. Slowly we made<br/>\nour way down the tunnels once again, this time running into many slavers<br/>\nthat we easily defeated, so easy that one of our higher level members<br/>\ndecided to go and find something a little more difficult. Not a second later<br/>\nshe came running back to our group with Meldrath on her tail.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have been slain by Meldrath.<br/>\nLOADING...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of of members was able to gate out succesfully, the rest of us assembled<br/>\nin Kelethin for the long run back. Upon arriving at the cave entrance we<br/>\nbegan to formulate our plan, each party member would go in with a guide both<br/>\nwould be camoflaged making it a tricky venture since no one had the ability<br/>\nto cast see invisible. Our first member went in with our druid giude, only<br/>\nto lose invis half way to his corpse. Amidst thier screams they emerged from<br/>\nthe mino caves trailing a slaver. With much effort we all managed to pummel<br/>\nthe beast into submission with our bare hands and whatver spells or songs we<br/>\nhad memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a brief session of playing Hymn to heal everyone, the brave volunteer<br/>\nonce again entered the cave only to get lost before finding his corpse.<br/>\nPanicking, he tried to make his way back to the entrance, only to have the<br/>\nMino Hero show his angry presence and slay most of the party once again.<br/>\nLuckily I survived this attack by making haste to run to Ak&#39;Anon, I then<br/>\nventured back to the Steamfront entrance to wait for my parties arrival.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce assembled again, we ventured to the mino caves and started to shout for<br/>\nthe assistance of any high level players in the area. While we waited for<br/>\nsome reply I recieved camoflage and made my way back into the caves. Knowing<br/>\nthe way fairly well to where I fell, I found my corpse and started the long<br/>\nprocess of dragging it back to safety, wearily eyeing the many slavers that<br/>\nI crossed paths with. Finally dragging my lifeless body out into the<br/>\nsunshine I looted my items and let my heart rate drop to a normal level.<br/>\nDuring this time a seasoned Druid in the form of a wolf came to our aid and<br/>\nbegan to guide people into the maze of tunnels to recover thir corpse, with<br/>\ntime all but one of our party had recovered their items, and the last was on<br/>\nhis way into the caves to complete our foul task. Just then the Mino Hero<br/>\nonce again showed his ugly face, and while the rest of my comrades fell once<br/>\nagain, the high level druid and I took turns running the beast to any guard<br/>\nwe could find in hopes of them defeating it. Some six guards later the beast<br/>\nwas dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end once tht party was reassembled, our last party member let the<br/>\nWolf Druid loot his corpse for him and upon the successfully reclaimation,<br/>\nthis fine person offered to group gate us to anyplace in Norrath some we may<br/>\nhave a more fuitful adventure, but alas we were all far to tired to<br/>\ncontemplate another travel to some distant land. With many thanks with broke<br/>\nour company and all headed to our respective homelands.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
