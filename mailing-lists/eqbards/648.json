Do all you can to reduce &quot;down time&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nA great many bards think that any song they want to do is great.  But this<br/>\nis NOT true.  Learn how to &quot;read&quot; the group you&#39;re in.  A group that&#39;s heavy<br/>\nin melee chars but light in healers will require you to stack healing and<br/>\nanthem, for example.  As you advance in level, you&#39;ll find you have more<br/>\noptions of what songs to play to enhance the performance and survivability<br/>\nof your group.  Learning how to choose the right song combo for your group<br/>\nand the types of mobs you&#39;re hunting, is perhaps the single most important<br/>\nskill you will ever learn, and will garner you the best chance of being the<br/>\nbard always in demand.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinako LindenLyre of MithMarr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
