We said in beta, why do we strum a stick? they<br/>\n&gt; said, it&#39;s beta we&#39;ll fix it. Release, we still strum a stick, they say we<br/>\n&gt; forgot to do the drum. Drum gets likened to the barb shield thing, it&#39;s<br/>\ntoo<br/>\n&gt; big, maybe we can fix it later. Something like a year later, new lands<br/>\n(and<br/>\n&gt; all that modeling) still a stick. Nostrolo&#39;s tamborine gets turned into a<br/>\n&gt; tamborine instead of a stick, all drums are still sticks. Give me odds the<br/>\n&gt; next addition and the chance to recitfy the drum thing and avoid the large<br/>\n&gt; d/l (cited as a main drawback to fixing) still won&#39;t have a drum. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; played a bard for 2 years as of next month, and that seems like a damn<br/>\nlong<br/>\n&gt; time for something to be outstanding. It says they either don&#39;t care or<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; are simply unable to deal with the volume of problems they have. Granted I<br/>\n&gt; am a perfectionist, and spent 15 years in Nuclear Maintenance to make it<br/>\n&gt; worse.

My cleric<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; I either join a group or form one. When no enchanter is available, I have<br/>\n&gt; been doing the crowd control. My best is to charm one, have it fight the<br/>\n&gt; second or use the 53 mez. The best I can do is 2 mobs mez&#39;ed. I just don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; seem to have time to get a 3rd effectively. I was actually down to one<br/>\n&gt; bubble of mana left at one point, and we were just at bridge 3.

Also ever fear/snare in burning woods?  Its more<br/>\n&gt; effective than a balanced group of 6 fighting the mobs straight up there.<br/>\n&gt; We even have sold our cleric on the idea, and he just blasts the mobs now<br/>\n&gt; (and heals when things go awry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chains:  I always have this memmed in dungeons too.  Why?  Because stuff<br/>\n&gt; happens.  Your ranger goes LD before snaring.  Someone screws up and roots<br/>\n&gt; the mob (breaking snare).  There is no snarer in the group (or your snarer<br/>\n&gt; is too low).  In any case NOBODY else can chase down a mob while casting<br/>\n&gt; snare in an emrgency.

This is our most powerful<br/>\n&gt; song (till higher lvl then its the 39 charm song).  Worse case of this<br/>\nsong<br/>\n&gt; is you have one mob damaging the mob the parry is on rather than you 90%<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; the time.  Best case, you have 2 mobs beating on each other, while the<br/>\nparty<br/>\n&gt; kills a third.  Oh yea, tell the enchanter who has half a bub of life when<br/>\n&gt; you charm the mob off him (giving the healer time to heal) that you<br/>\n&gt; shouldn;t mem the song when he&#39;s around.

Player 1 walks, leading the group to their camp<br/>\n&gt; in the dungeon.  Rest of group, inlcuding bard singing clouding follows.<br/>\n&gt; Player 2 who also knows the way &quot;sweeps&quot; behind the group making sure all<br/>\n&gt; stay close.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 12 Oct 2000 16:41:23 +0200<br/>\n&gt;    From: Stephane Lange &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slange@...\">slange@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: bards in guilds...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; he he we are 6 bards over 30 in our guild on 40 people<br/>\n&gt; but i guess we are not representative, we are problably the guild with<br/>\n&gt; the greatest ratio &quot;bard other classes&quot; :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Message d&#39;origine-----<br/>\n&gt; De : Cyr, Thierry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thierry.cyr@...\">thierry.cyr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Envoye : jeudi 12 octobre 2000 14:06<br/>\n&gt; A : &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Objet : [eqbards] bards in guilds...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a quick question.

I see how it is...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alrighty, as to why working as intended isn&#39;t good<br/>\n&gt; enough: Simple answer is gameplay.  I&#39;ve heard horror<br/>\n&gt; stories of people trying to use the 51 (52?) travel<br/>\n&gt; song only to have one member get hit and fall to their<br/>\n&gt; death.  I&#39;ve also heard this song won&#39;t stack with<br/>\n&gt; dead man floating which would fix the problems with<br/>\n&gt; this song right there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What a lot of these songs should do (45th song, the<br/>\n&gt; travel song, etc) is create more than one spell icon.<br/>\n&gt; The upper level haste song that has the DS on it<br/>\n&gt; should have the damage shield component seperate.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From what I&#39;ve heard, the DS is lost so quickly thus<br/>\n&gt; canceling the whole song effect that upper level bards<br/>\n&gt; simply switch to an earlier haste song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s why these &quot;working as intended&quot; songs were a<br/>\n&gt; good idea but bad reality.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Abashi&#39;s comments about our singing steel pissed me<br/>\n&gt; off even more.  Exactly what are we balanced against<br/>\n&gt; right now?  The warrior Cobalt is something I&#39;d love<br/>\n&gt; to have. Don&#39;t most of the pieces have healing<br/>\n&gt; properties in the form of self buffs to them?  I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; really love to know what moron thought the helm,<br/>\n&gt; pants, and boots effects were balanced.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The reason why lots of the older bards are still<br/>\n&gt; chaffing at the whole lullaby issue is indeed how it<br/>\n&gt; used to work.  But it&#39;s also how Verant decided to<br/>\n&gt; handle that whole issue.  We have the head magic guy<br/>\n&gt; at the time publicly stating it seems messed up.<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re told to wait patiently which we do, for 6 to 8<br/>\n&gt; months. In that time the break another song but fix<br/>\n&gt; it.  Then they break that song again and refuse to fix<br/>\n&gt; it.  Then they have a mouthpiece come out and say<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;ll get to the bottom of this who promptly tells us<br/>\n&gt; some lame excuse about how it&#39;s never supposed to have<br/>\n&gt; been useable after 30th.  So where&#39;s the upgrade of<br/>\n&gt; lullaby around 29th???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re a bard that was around when you could use<br/>\n&gt; lullaby as it used to be, you&#39;re more than likely<br/>\n&gt; pretty pissed off right now.  The reason is because 2<br/>\n&gt; classes (shaman and cleric) has essentially had their<br/>\n&gt; own lullaby issue come up and it either got fixed or<br/>\n&gt; is getting fixed.  Mark of Karn was nerfed, they<br/>\n&gt; suggested fixes, and Verant went with the one the<br/>\n&gt; clerics wanted. BTW, the fix wasn&#39;t one of the options<br/>\n&gt; Verant gave them.  All that got done in about a week.<br/>\n&gt; It seems now the shamen have gotten Verant to look<br/>\n&gt; into their uber weapon.  How much you wanna bet they<br/>\n&gt; get a fix close to what the shamen as a whole will be<br/>\n&gt; happy with?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since I&#39;m one of those bards who got to play with<br/>\n&gt; lullaby, you&#39;re asking if I&#39;m so livid, why do I play<br/>\n&gt; a bard?  Mainly cause none of my secondaries are close<br/>\n&gt; to 45.  However, I&#39;ve heard is said you can get a<br/>\n&gt; warrior to close to that in 2 months or so.  Mine&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; 13th in 3 of my regular play days.  Oh, and with<br/>\n&gt; bandages, I&#39;m soloing.  I figure a shaman is probably<br/>\n&gt; closer to being a bard but I just don&#39;t like how<br/>\n&gt; female barbarians look.  Hehe, and I am a true bard<br/>\n&gt; when it comes to astetics :P (I saw an absolutely<br/>\n&gt; perfect combo.  Runed mithril tunic with BI leggins,<br/>\n&gt; arms, boots, gloves and a leather helm.  The half-elf<br/>\n&gt; wearing it looked great. Mithril BP, arms, and<br/>\n&gt; leggings with singing steel bracers, gauntlets, helm<br/>\n&gt; and boots looks awesome too.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, to sum up, Abashi is full of it, I&#39;m bitter,<br/>\n&gt; and I think it&#39;s perfectly acceptable to make choices<br/>\n&gt; in armor that cut down your AC but 100 to 150 points<br/>\n&gt; or so in the name a fashion :)  Another valueable post<br/>\n&gt; from me, lol!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OH!  I do remember dragonrealms too.  I was a warrior<br/>\n&gt; mage there.  It was 9.95 a month but you could upgrade<br/>\n&gt; to 29.95 a month to get access to better hunting<br/>\n&gt; areas, and your own house.  Was a good game but the<br/>\n&gt; people who ran it angered me to no end and I left when<br/>\n&gt; an alternative came out (taps foot waiting for Anarchy<br/>\n&gt; Online&#39;s release date).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OH!  Something else I remembered while proof reading.<br/>\n&gt; There was a post on whineplay from a bard complaining<br/>\n&gt; about a stealth nerf on selo&#39;s.  Reports were<br/>\n&gt; conflicting about it so I blew off that issue.<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday I noticed selo&#39;s acceleration got noticeably<br/>\n&gt; faster.

Ugh, lower average damage<br/>\n&gt; because of the hits for 1 and more hits for 1 because the +str bumps<br/>\n&gt; them up from a 0 damage hit (miss). It&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t always tell<br/>\n&gt; the difference between an avoided miss and a mitigated 0 damage hit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just as a point of curiousity:<br/>\n&gt; How often do you, as a bard, get ridden for +str songs? I haven&#39;t gone<br/>\n&gt; out of my way to use one lately except when I&#39;m smithing. After looking<br/>\n&gt; at how little +str effects overall damage (unless in a really melee<br/>\n&gt; heavy party) I stick with a haste effect (if no enchanter or I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; busy doing everything else) or damage shields or dots depending on<br/>\n&gt; situation. However, I&#39;ve only just hit 42 and haven&#39;t had a chance to<br/>\n&gt; try out McVaxius&#39; yet so everything might change after I give it a<br/>\n&gt; whirl.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Jeffrey Sue &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i actually have a few questions about this stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; +1 str == +1 atk right?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now, is atk like ac in that it is made of up 2 numbers, like chance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to hit, and damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; done, sorta like damage avoidance and damage absorption?  if so, then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; real damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; applied would also have to increase.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone got a good link to the analysis done on this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get Yahoo!
