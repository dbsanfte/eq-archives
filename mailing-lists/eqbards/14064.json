More likely I will still be complaining about<br/>\novercrowding at the higher levels, much as I am now.  The only time I<br/>\nthought there wasn&#39;t overcrowding was at levels 12-15 when I was in Paw.<br/>\nThat place was Empty with a capital E!  So was Kerra Isle.  Once they no<br/>\nlonger provided useful xp I found myself running into zones with 100+ people<br/>\nagain.  Even 45 people in Najena is way too many, that zone is tiny!  143 in<br/>\nE Karana was pretty pointless too, unless you just wanted to travel.  I have<br/>\nno doubt that the higher levels suffer from overcrowding, but I think its<br/>\njust as prevalent at lower levels.  &#39;sides we all know you&#39;re not a<br/>\npowergamer Harm, else you&#39;d have solo&#39;d Naggy as many times as Rokenn by<br/>\nnow...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 31, 2000 7:35 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] (OT) Lower level discrimination was Play Time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wanted to answer this, and quote things from the message<br/>\n  but I haven&#39;t the energy.
