The original warrior armor<br/>\nfrom PoF was mislabeled so that a variety of classes<br/>\n(including bards) could use it.  Being warrior armor, the<br/>\nstats were way better than anything available to those<br/>\nclasses.  They fixed it so only warriors could equip it, there<br/>\nwas a huge outcry, they changed it back, and created some new<br/>\nwarrior armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, if an item is no-drop (so trades are a non-issue)<br/>\nand it&#39;s obvious the benefit is due to a bug (guise, warrior<br/>\nPoF armor), then I say fix it and who cares about the<br/>\ncomplaints from those who would exploit obvious bugs.<br/>\nApparently Verant felt differently.  People say making a<br/>\npreviously useful item useless is bad, which it is.  But now<br/>\nwe have a situation where everyone who got the item early has<br/>\na permanent and unmatchable advantage over everyone else.  I<br/>\nhave to wonder if Verant inadvertantly chose the greater of<br/>\ntwo evils here.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
