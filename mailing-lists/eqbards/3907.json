Tons of good info and<br/>\nquality folks. I have been studying online cultures for a lot of years now,<br/>\nusenet, a martial arts mailing list, web boards, UO and EQ (and RZ which was<br/>\na whole different animal till they broke it), it&#39;s just a hobby, the<br/>\nsociology of online cultures. And this is a good un.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO wish there were a better mechanism for off topic stuff, because when<br/>\nyou have a good group of smart folks you begin to want to know what they<br/>\nthink about off topic, er, topics. Subject flags can help I suppose but<br/>\nfolks always forget to put them in, a seperate mailing list breaks the<br/>\nperception of a social collective. *sigh* I don&#39;t think there is an easy<br/>\nanswer. But I just wanted to say I have no problem with off topic issues (in<br/>\nfact there was one I really liked- about women run quests-that had to end<br/>\n*sigh* at least I missed it if it continued as I was changing addresses<br/>\nwhere I got the list) but I do understand the culture also breaks down if<br/>\nit&#39;s not focused. SO! Keep up the good work everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz D&#39;Kith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
