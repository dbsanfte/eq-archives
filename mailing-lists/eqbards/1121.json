I picked it up to re-read it specifically for ideas for my bard.<br/>\nThough Amergin is not exactly the kind of bard that I want my character to<br/>\nbe, it is still a stirring novel.  The whole druid heirarchy in those days<br/>\nis spelled out quite clearly in this book.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe words Amergin sang to quell his mad brother&#39;s fierceness was very much<br/>\nlike a spell in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also has a book called _Druids_ that is very good, though probably not<br/>\nmuch like the EQ druid class.
