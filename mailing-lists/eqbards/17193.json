I don&#39;t enjoy PvP just for<br/>\nthe sake of PvP.  What you said about large scale events, however, is very<br/>\ntrue.  Those can be incredible fun and a great way to enhance an already fun<br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer the multiplayer venue for the Co-Op aspect.  I don&#39;t like the PvP<br/>\naspect except as a roleplaying outlet.  IE:  I&#39;m an evil nasty shadowknight,<br/>\nyou&#39;re a goodie too shoes paladin... die scum!  Or wars, etc.   Or self<br/>\ndefense or dealing with a situation where force is the only answer.   PvP<br/>\nallows players to police themselves, to an extent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it might help his situation but it wouldn&#39;t solve burn-out.  You can<br/>\ndelay it, but eventually ANY game gets old.  The biggest thing about<br/>\nburn-out, I think, is the overcrowding.  My solution was to move to the<br/>\nPvP-Teams servers.  They&#39;re never crowded and a lot of fun.  Plus they&#39;re a<br/>\ngreat environment for my guild to have player events without having to jump<br/>\nthrough hoops and get GM&#39;s involved for PvP...  Light VS. Dark battles are a<br/>\nsnap here.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur - Veeshan<br/>\naka:  Tryxie the Rogue - Tallon Zek<br/>\n(PS:  It&#39;s SO fun to steal from other players ;)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 31, 2000 11:25 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Attack speedups<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; PvP games have better potential for open ended interest.  Playing against<br/>\n&gt; human brains is a lot more fun than against NPC&#39;s that do the same thing<br/>\n&gt; over and over. (I wish my friends would have switched to PvP server about<br/>\n48<br/>\n&gt; levels ago but we decided to stay on Innoruuk.)  There is no dynamic to EQ<br/>\n&gt; NPC&#39;s.  Once you find out what they do, you can rely on them to do it<br/>\nonver<br/>\n&gt; and over again.  In the PvP games that I have played, you can do<br/>\nobstensibly<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;same thing&quot; over and over yet each time it can be different and<br/>\nunique.<br/>\n&gt; I am talk about the games where you are on more or less equal terms in<br/>\n&gt; &quot;equipment&quot; but the &quot;skills&quot; depend on the person and their ability to<br/>\nplay<br/>\n&gt; the game.  Games where you have to make decisions in battle and the<br/>\n&gt; situation is dynamic.  And the dynamics come from having real live<br/>\nthinking<br/>\n&gt; people as opponents vs pre-programmed NPC&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; EQ has great potential for PvP in role playing situations but my year has<br/>\n&gt; been spent on an NPC server so I have seen very little of that.  On the<br/>\n&gt; other hand, I have been in &quot;scenarios&quot; in other games where you have 1000<br/>\n&gt; registered players and each plays a &quot;role&quot; (not talking with accents but<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; a tactical role in planned combat.)   These have been the most<br/>\nentertaining<br/>\n&gt; events I have been part of.  EQ could do alot more of this to develop<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; &quot;GM Events&quot; or &quot;large scale events.&quot;  And we hashed this all out here<br/>\n&gt; before.  You need it to be &quot;staged&quot; in out of game venues (web pages,<br/>\n&gt; discussion forums, assigned team leaders, pre-planned actions) all this so<br/>\n&gt; people know where to go and what to do once they get online and want to<br/>\nkill<br/>\n&gt; stuff.  Think of 2 teams of 6 full groups starting on opposite sides of<br/>\n&gt; Rathe Mts with the objective of securing some designated spot like the<br/>\n&gt; burned out fortress.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have dueled, you know that the combat technique is alot different<br/>\n&gt; from soloing or grouping vs NPC&#39;s (you get to use all kinds of different<br/>\n&gt; songs - and some of them actually work.)  But do any of us have<br/>\nsignificant<br/>\n&gt; experience in &quot;guildwar&quot; combat?  Where multiple groups of comparable<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; and equipment face off to accomplish some tactical and or strategic goal?<br/>\n&gt; Fighting against other people provides for a more dynamic combat and thus<br/>\n&gt; holds interest much longer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All the stuff you mention about how characters have become one-dimensional<br/>\n&gt; at the high levels - I pretty much agree with.  The way they have designed<br/>\n&gt; the higher levels where multiple group combat is necessary kind of forces<br/>\n&gt; this situation even more.  There is no &quot;west karana&quot; for level 50&#39;s to<br/>\nshout<br/>\n&gt; for a group and go hunt &quot;tormented, undead, rotting, tentecle, thought<br/>\n&gt; ravishing, bixie commanders.&quot;   Maybe expansion has these - 20 new<br/>\ndragons?<br/>\n&gt; Zones larger than West K? Hmmm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fighting NPC&#39;s relies on them to make new npc&#39;s.  Fight other people can<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; different each time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 4:03 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Attack speedups<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, 30 Mar 2000, Sylly Songsynger wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You don&#39;t understand.
