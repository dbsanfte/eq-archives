Fortunately bards can run fast and zone, or die.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A caster without his equipment is far more effective than any melee class,<br/>\n&gt;monks excepted, when he is naked.  A caster&#39;s main equipment is his spells<br/>\n&gt;which he can regain immediately.  All other classes rely on thing they left<br/>\n&gt;on their body to survive.
