NO MORE POWERLEVELING! I am just going to enjoy it for a while, the <br/>\n&gt;next<br/>\n&gt;two songs (see invis and psalm of warmth) are stinkers anyway,so no big<br/>\n&gt;hurry.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually Pslam of Warmth is NOT a stinker, it is a great song.  An <br/>\nundocumented feature of the song is that it provides a group damage shield <br/>\n(starts at 5 damage).  The damage shield stacks with all other shields <br/>\n(except cold based ones I have been told).  If you think a 5 point damage <br/>\nshield is not significant in your next group battle count the number of <br/>\ntimes the mobs hit anyone in your party and multiply by 5 :)   Also see <br/>\ninvisibility is great for spotting cloaked kill stealers, and it give <br/>\nultravision for the blind humans in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
