The druid<br/>\nasked if there was an order, and I said yes, myself and the cleric, and<br/>\nanother wizard that was present. The druid, instead of asking if she could<br/>\nhave a turn in the rotation, stated that it would be a &quot;FFA&quot; (free for all).<br/>\nWhy would a L28 druid barge into the warlord room in that manner, unless they<br/>\nwere confident they could win every kill? As I said, after my demonstration,<br/>\nshe apologized for how she acted and said she was not aware a bard could do<br/>\nsuch a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSide note, I also have a lower level druid I play, and it is extremely easy to<br/>\ndo enough damage to get credit for a kill. However, having played through 26<br/>\nlevels as a class where I was often having my kill stolen, I instead help<br/>\nothers and only steal kills off people doing it to others, whether they be<br/>\nbards, warriors, or lower level players. I&#39;m sort of a Robin Hood of EQ - help<br/>\nthose in need, and antagonize the jerks to no end.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; No, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with this picture. There was a druid AND a<br/>\n&gt; cleric. A cleric CAN use a BI crown (uh oh! acronym!). Both of the people<br/>\n&gt; were appropriate level. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
