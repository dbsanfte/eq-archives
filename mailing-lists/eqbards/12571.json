Let<br/>\n&gt;   me help you out here... There is visual lag (all the crap you are<br/>\n&gt;   stating) and there is server lag.  The location server cannot keep<br/>\n&gt;   pace with 50 or 60 people standing in one place.  It never has,<br/>\n&gt;   even in beta.  Verant simply hasn&#39;t designed the game to accomodate<br/>\n&gt;   that.  I do not get visual lag.  I get server lag.  In fact, to<br/>\n&gt;   the point where I completely crash. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
