If you&#39;re fighting mob(s)s<br/>\nthat will likely kill you before your group can finish the<br/>\nother target(s), then just don&#39;t bother singing any songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s happening is that every time your party buff song(s)<br/>\npulses, every mob in the area registers it and bumps you up on<br/>\ntheir hate list.  Since the puller hasn&#39;t likely done much<br/>\ndamage, you will immediately surpass him on the hate list and<br/>\nthe mob will attack you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway I dont know if it was his lousy taunt or if bard songs ultra aggro<br/>\n&gt; mobs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How about some group tactics for bards lessons?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any hints will make me very happy..:)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, I never found much way to avoid it between<br/>\nabout L10-16.  I played around with starting my songs later in<br/>\nthe fight at L12-14, and basically, unless I started my songs<br/>\n5 seconds before the mobs died, they&#39;d aggro on me.  The<br/>\nproblem starts to go away in your low 20s, as the other<br/>\nclasses damage/taunt abilities surpass ours.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind some good clerics and try to stick with them.  They will<br/>\nactually appreciate you for having this problem because it&#39;ll<br/>\nkeep the mobs off them, and they&#39;ll only have to heal one<br/>\nperson.  You&#39;ll also find it handy having lots of cleric<br/>\nfriends when you reach level 29+ for their res spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
