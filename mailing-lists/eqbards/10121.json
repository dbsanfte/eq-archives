LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 32nd with maxed 1HB and maxed 1HS, a Staff of Writhing and a Silvery War<br/>\nAxe I can kill a light blue if nothing abnormal happens and he&#39;s not a<br/>\ncaster.  Taking on a blue or deep blue would be tantamount to suicide, at<br/>\nbest very, very risky.  For me a solid blue mob would be a Lizard Fanatic in<br/>\nCazic-Thule.  It would pound me into the mud one-on-one.  No question.  On<br/>\nthe other hand, a light blue would be a gator in the sewers.  I *can* solo<br/>\none of those.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you know how I chose to kill a Fan?  I group and play Hymn, Anthem,<br/>\nBinding, Clarity, Pixie Strike, Lullaby, etc.  People like to have me in a<br/>\ngroup because of all the &quot;miscellaneous&quot; stuff that I/we do.  No<br/>\nenchanter? - Pixie Strike that Herald while the meleers in the group kill<br/>\nthe Page.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo kill a solid blue mob a 35th bard would have to do a bit more than &quot;kite<br/>\na little&quot; to be comfortable.  They&#39;d have to GROUP.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; \t\tWell my Shaman is 35, and I have decent armor for my level<br/>\n&gt; nothing special.  I have an observer staff and am maxed (I think) for my<br/>\n&gt; level in 2H blunt.  And all I have to say is that buffed up to the hilt, I<br/>\n&gt; can MAYBE solo a blue in melee (not using DOT and DD)...but I doubt it.<br/>\n&gt; This is strict melee.  Even when I use my spells, I still need to kite a<br/>\n&gt; little to be comfortable.  My bard is only 17 and does just fine on a<br/>\n&gt; blue... I don&#39;t know how she will be at 35 yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\tI guess my point (do I have one here?) is that my bard kicks<br/>\n&gt; ass in melee compared to my shaman (can&#39;t say about other hybrid<br/>\n&gt; classes or<br/>\n&gt; about other bards or other shaman).  Shaman are best at niche filling -<br/>\n&gt; turning the tide of battle in our favor, whether by buffing,<br/>\n&gt; debuffing or a<br/>\n&gt; nicely placed heal or DD.  Maybe bards are best at that too, with a slight<br/>\n&gt; emphasis on getting in there and fighting.  But if my shaman is<br/>\n&gt; taking hits,<br/>\n&gt; I crumple just about as fast as a wizard :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\tTani 17th Bard<br/>\n&gt; \t\tHalana 35th Shaman<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSolusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tFrom:\tKimes, Dean W.<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tSent:\tMonday, November 15, 1999 11:09 AM<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] RE: RE: Bellow<br/>\n&gt; song Damage<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tIf you jump off a 10 story building you will<br/>\n&gt; fall.

Dual wield was not sufficient to<br/>\n&gt; prevent me from being pummeled due to<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tthe numerous stuns I received.  All shamans<br/>\n&gt; have slam.  Sure it never goes<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tup, but it is still sufficient to stun a<br/>\n&gt; 17th level bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tBards are better than all hybrids in magical<br/>\n&gt; power?  Under what microscope<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tdid you determine that?  At lower levels its<br/>\n&gt; obviously true as the other<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\thybrids have no magical power.  Hmm lets<br/>\n&gt; examine them at higher levels.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tPaladin get Greater Heal, 400 hp that&#39;s 3<br/>\n&gt; minutes worth of Hymn with a lute<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tand it takes them less time than that to<br/>\n&gt; meditate back the mana.  They also<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tget Revive at their utmost level of spell<br/>\n&gt; use.  Not to mention Lay Hands.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tRangers probably have the weakest line of<br/>\n&gt; spells getting nothing above Heal,<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tthough they do get Wolf Form, cool but not<br/>\n&gt; overly powerful.  Shadowknights<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tspells are fearsome.  The Engulfing Darkness<br/>\n&gt; DoT line is devastating as it<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tdestroys our best defense, Acellerando and<br/>\n&gt; it stacks with their Heat Blood.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tThey also now have the lifetap series.  All<br/>\n&gt; this aside their Harm Touch<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\talone is a devastating if slow to recharge<br/>\n&gt; weapon.  We do have a greater<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tnumber of spells than the other hybrids do<br/>\n&gt; though.  Are our abilities<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tobviously better, I would not say so.<br/>\n&gt; Better in a full group of six maybe,<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tbetter in small groups, that&#39;s not apparent.<br/>\n&gt; Even if we were better it<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tcertainly would not be 5-6 times better and<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s how the other hybrids<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\trelate to us in terms of melee skills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tNow since I have stated that bards magical<br/>\n&gt; abilities might not be so much<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tbetter than some of the other hybrids,<br/>\n&gt; rangers excluded as their spells are<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\ttruly weak, feel free to call me a liar.<br/>\n&gt; That will just be one more<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tdefinition you will need to look up on<br/>\n&gt; Merriam-Webster Online, right after<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\t&#39;fact&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tTo further turn your argument around:<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tBards cannot beat any caster consistently in<br/>\n&gt; pure magical combat. (though<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tI&#39;ve come close with Maxell MR)<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tBards cannot beat any other hybrid or melee<br/>\n&gt; type consistently in pure melee<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tcombat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tNeither of those statements however true<br/>\n&gt; prove we are weaker than those<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tclasses any more than yours prove we are<br/>\n&gt; equal in power.  In my opinion, we<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tare weaker than several of the other<br/>\n&gt; classes.  The weakness is not generally<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\toverbearing but that doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be corrected.  To be honest I<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tthink a realignment of our skills would<br/>\n&gt; suffice to bridge the gap without<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tmodifications to our spells other than<br/>\n&gt; including the missing ones and fixing<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tthe broken ones.  An added melee skill like<br/>\n&gt; Parry which succeeds more often<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tthan Dodge, and some raised caps on skills<br/>\n&gt; that are currently of debatable<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tusefulness would help as well.  Most<br/>\n&gt; Jack-of-all-trades are seen as<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tself-sufficient characters while we are<br/>\n&gt; definitely not designed to be very<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tcapable on our own.  We do best in groups<br/>\n&gt; due to the nature of our spells.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tIt is this very grouping nature that further<br/>\n&gt; undermines the usefulness of<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tour other skills as there will often be<br/>\n&gt; present others in the group whose<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tskill so far overshadows ours in those other<br/>\n&gt; areas that we might as well not<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\thave the skill at all. There is no benefit<br/>\n&gt; to having Find Traps and Pick<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tLocks when there is a rogue in the group<br/>\n&gt; with more than double your skill.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tIf we were meant to be characters who could<br/>\n&gt; function on their own and do<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tnearly everything, if not well, that would<br/>\n&gt; be different.  However, we are<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tnot.  We are meant to group and for every<br/>\n&gt; member we add to our group some of<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tour skills become superfluous just as our<br/>\n&gt; magical powers become more potent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\t\tKitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\tFrom: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\t1.
