I&#39;m interested in input<br/>\nfor how I can allow my more of party to survive a battle, including<br/>\nmyself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of us were 11th Level, except for the Warrior, and the party<br/>\nwas comprised of:<br/>\n2x Rangers<br/>\n2x Bards (myself and another)<br/>\na Druid<br/>\nA Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried the camp a total of three times, some of us dying every time.<br/>\nThere were(I think) 5 bandits, all blue, except for one, which was yellow.<br/>\nThe first time I had the misfortune to be playing Hymn twisted with Anthem<br/>\nfrom the beginning of the fight, and I ended up with three bandits on me due, I<br/>\nthink to Hymn. Needless to say, I died. It was a fun run of shame back to<br/>\nmy body...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second time we tried it, we were actually jumped -- a pair of<br/>\nbandits running by started the fray, and the five from the camp<br/>\njoined the fun. This time the other Bard was killed; he was playing<br/>\nHymn. When I noticed his health dropping rapidly, I told him to back<br/>\noff, and he did, but the bandits didn&#39;t stop. Is there anything I could<br/>\nhave done to pull them off of him?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third time, again there were 7 bandits. A ranger shot at a bandit<br/>\nin the camp and those 5 ran at us, and two more running by at the same<br/>\ntime joined the fray. This time, I decided to use Discord, rather then Hymn<br/>\nto try to do extra damage. I liked seeing 7 messages &quot;a bandit winces&quot;! But<br/>\nonce again, I managed to get the attention of a pair of bandits, and died. I&#39;d<br/>\nasked the other Bard to play Elemental Rhythms, as there was a yellow bandit<br/>\ncaster in the camp.  He died also, I&#39;m really not sure why.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time I grabbed my spare drum to make the run back a little faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anybody have any suggestions of how I could have survived the first and<br/>\nlast fight, and kept the rest of the party alive also?<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that I&#39;m only level 11 -- so I&#39;m really not interested in <br/>\nhearing about<br/>\nsongs that are higher levels(at least until I get there :).<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, I had fun, but it was a loosing night for me and experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you<br/>\nJamie Furtner<br/>\n<br/>\nQuies, 11th Song, Karana<br/>\n-- Jamie Furtner <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfurtner@...\">jfurtner@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
