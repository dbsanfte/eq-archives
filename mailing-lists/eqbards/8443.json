Well I got totally ticked off and lost my temper and started<br/>\n&gt;cussing like crazy at him (in private tell) to which he responded he would<br/>\n&gt;get his bard character and meet me and kick my A** all over highkeep, to<br/>\n&gt;which I brilliantly responded &quot;kiss my a** you stupid fu**er&quot; (I know, real<br/>\n&gt;intelligent).
