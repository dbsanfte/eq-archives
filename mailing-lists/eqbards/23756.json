It is a composite number made up of two parts.  One part is Hit<br/>\nAvoidance, this effects how often you are actually hit.  The other is Damage<br/>\nMitigation, this effects how much damage you take when you get hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttack works the same way.  It is made up of a To Hit portion and a Damage<br/>\nportion.  The numbers were both shown in beta for awhile, but where taken<br/>\nout because they were &#39;to confusing&#39; and replace with the misleading<br/>\ncomposite numbers we see today.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jamie R.

Take off a piece of <br/>\n&gt; armor with 10 AC and no agi bonuses and you might like 20+ <br/>\n&gt; AC.  So if I reduces your &quot;raw&quot; AC by 16, that could be a <br/>\n&gt; large &quot;calculated&quot; AC decrease.  Again, I have no idea if <br/>\n&gt; this is how this works.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ueni, 54 Rogue Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Llaenie, 23 Bard Tunare </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
