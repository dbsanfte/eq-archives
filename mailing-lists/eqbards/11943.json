Most of the work we<br/>\ndo involves simulators for the U.S. military, so we made it as<br/>\nfaithful to the real thing as we could.  The communications<br/>\nand map use the same klunky monochrome interface on the real<br/>\nM1 (as near as we could model it), and the big one - generally<br/>\nyou get hit once and you&#39;re dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe play testers hated it.  We had to add an &quot;arcade mode&quot;<br/>\nwhere you could take 2 or 3 hits before being knocked out of<br/>\naction.  (We also had to change the map so it was omniscient<br/>\nso you could always see all friendly units - something I<br/>\nguarantee you real tank commanders wish they had but don&#39;t - <br/>\nbut I digress.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe testers felt those were minimum requirements for making<br/>\nthe game playable and fun.  Sometimes, what makes logical<br/>\nsense has to be sacrificed for playability.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You go up against Cain, you expect to be dead.

If a<br/>\nwell-coordinated group can take out Cazic while suffering<br/>\nminimal casualties, then giving him a death touch is a<br/>\ncop-out.  You couldn&#39;t make him buff or smart enough to kill<br/>\nplayers, so you made him do it automatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink for a moment.  If CT *really* had a death touch, what<br/>\nwould he do the moment he discovered mortals were messing<br/>\naround in his realm?  DT all of them.  Isn&#39;t that what *you&#39;d*<br/>\ndo if you were playing CT?  If you want a balanced (i.e. fun)<br/>\ngame, you can&#39;t go willy nilly giving mobs all sorts of<br/>\nsuper-powers.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
