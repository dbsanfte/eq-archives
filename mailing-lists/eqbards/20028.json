Its easy to<br/>\nplay<br/>\n  a battle bard and sing mana song after combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Your right everyone does have their own way to play bards.  And I do<br/>\nlove the &quot;battle bard&quot; side of things.  Why?  Because I want to be part of<br/>\nthe action.....<br/>\n<br/>\n  But see with bards we can do many things - As I am finding out with<br/>\nJacana....<br/>\n<br/>\n  I pull rather well with Jac in groups.  Because she has the speed she can<br/>\nrun faster (unless there&#39;s a shaman in the group to sow a ranger...)  Just<br/>\nrun up do a bellow and run off *grin*  And while running back to the group<br/>\nget a bit of kiting in ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also Jac&#39;s weapons right now are just amazing as far as I am concerned.<br/>\nShe&#39;s not bad in combat and I have yet to see a group complain about her in<br/>\ncombat.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But as a bard you need to be smart.  If I see the group is balanced enough<br/>\nthen I will switch back to instruments.  I am not great at twisting<br/>\ninsturments yet but I can do something...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another about bards that I have found groups love is the hate list :)  If<br/>\na pull is too big the bard can run around the group with 3/4 of the mobs<br/>\npulled run heal run heal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But I really can&#39;t blame some of the higher level bards for not toally<br/>\nknowing what something may do.  Some of these people have been playing bards<br/>\nfor AGES!  And us new little bards can look at all these great web sites<br/>\nthat tell us exactly what the song does....<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jacana, Bard of 20th song, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
