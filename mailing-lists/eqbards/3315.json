I didn&#39;t start<br/>\n&gt; wearing plate until I had three pieces (breastplate, greaves,<br/>\n&gt; pauldron) because I was vain and didn&#39;t like the way bronze<br/>\n&gt; chest and banded leggings looked.  :-)  So I went from mostly<br/>\n&gt; banded to mostly plate rather quickly.  If you went piece by<br/>\n&gt; piece like most people seem to do, you may not have noticed.<br/>\n&gt; If you got plate early (so your AC was high enough that mobs<br/>\n&gt; were just hitting for less because it was way beyond their<br/>\n&gt; &quot;level&quot; range), you may not have noticed either figuring the<br/>\n&gt; extra damage was just due to the mobs being tougher.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just so you understand my experience, I had about 4 piece when I first<br/>\ndonned bronze plate, and I noticed that I was being hit less and the same<br/>\ncreatures (Carrions, Drys adn Monks) were hitting for the same amount.<br/>\nI then went on a purchase splurgefilled out the rest of my bronze except<br/>\nfor the mask and the gloves and I have only noticed that mobs are missing<br/>\nmore often and are hitting for aboutthe same amount of damage.  Though I<br/>\nhave noticed that my dodge has not fired as often as it has before.  But<br/>\nthat may be due to the higher AC.  Like other skills dodge is only checked<br/>\nwhen the creature successfully hits you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow my other observation has anyone noticed that if a mob hits you while<br/>\nyou are starting up a song he seems to be hit for max damage?  I noticed<br/>\nthe difference awhile ago when I picked up bellow.  I used to play one<br/>\nsong during combat.  Once I got bellow I noticed that hits that landed<br/>\njust as I started a song resulted in greater damage.  This is something<br/>\nthat I have seen while playing my mage character over the last few days.<br/>\nIf I am hit while casting death beetles almost always hit for 26 or so.<br/>\nCan anyone else confirm it?  When I saw it I just thought I was seeing<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver 20th Chorus Bard of Kelethin<br/>\nAariel 5th Circle Mage of Felwithe<br/>\nHonour Guard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
