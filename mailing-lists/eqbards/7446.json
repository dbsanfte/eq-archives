As useful as Acellerando?, no.  At 9th level,<br/>\nand obviously before,if not for our entire careers, our spells are far more<br/>\na defining part of our characters than any of the &#39;hybrids&#39; (RNG,PAL,SHD).<br/>\nAs far as I have heard it is NEVER suggested that any of these classes stand<br/>\nback and just cast spells in a group.  Most on this list advocate that role<br/>\nfor bards later in levels.  The main point was we are more dependant on<br/>\nspells than RNG, PAL, or SHD.  We are at least as dependent on spells as<br/>\nShamans and Clerics, though probably not druids.  There have even been<br/>\narticles proclaiming Shamans to be the ultimate warrior class.  Buff like<br/>\nmad, rush into melee cause you&#39;re big, strong, have armor equal to a ranger,<br/>\nand a big stick to swing.  If bards should be standing back and taking a<br/>\ncaster role, doesn&#39;t that make us more like, than unlike, those classes<br/>\nwhatever they are?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 4:03 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 30 Sep 1999, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At my current (and everyone in my now guild&#39;s) rate of progression we will<br/>\n&gt; reach the levels that you claim their spells make a difference in<br/>\n&gt; approximately 2.5 years.
