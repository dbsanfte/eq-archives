I <br/>\n&gt;had<br/>\n&gt;not, and am sure disappointed about it.  Has anyone found circumstances in<br/>\n&gt;which we do receive a &quot;charm breaks&quot; message?  Otherwise I chalk it up to a<br/>\n&gt;bug or flat-out mistake, like as the &quot;You have gotten better at<br/>\n&gt;Swimming(71/90)&quot; type messages that we never got.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Crier Sharpsong - 28th song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
