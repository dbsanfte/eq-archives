Didn&#39;t know you were on the &#39;list&#39;, glad to hear from you!<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t noticed resists in Kunark being unusually high, except for Iksars.<br/>\nThey are apparently immune to charm and resist a lot better than similar<br/>\nlevel mobs.  In addition they are smart enough to ignore your &#39;pet&#39; while<br/>\ncharming.<br/>\n<br/>\nTried to do fear/chains a bit in FM last night since its not something I<br/>\nconsider myself proficient at.  Learned that there are way too many<br/>\nwanderers there to do it effectively.  Did figure that if I was unmolested I<br/>\ncould beat a Sarnak Dragoon that just became blue to me, but I&#39;d take<br/>\nseveral bubs of damage due to resists.<br/>\n<br/>\nBurynai btw seem to be magic resistance deficient.  I had to charm a yellow<br/>\nDigmaster when it got involved in my Dragoon fight.  It never resisted on<br/>\nabout 30 charms.  Of course I had to flee from it after it killed the<br/>\nDragoon anyhow since it took about a sliver of counterattack damage from the<br/>\nDragoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi Faegehearper of E&#39;ci<br/>\n\tA bard on the first plane of Hell<br/>\n<br/>\nNinev Rudefulte<br/>\n32nd Chorus of Karana<br/>\nE&#39;Ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
