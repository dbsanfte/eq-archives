The Wak did about 2% more damage over time<br/>\nthan the Yak if you excluded the procs.  OTOH, even with a 50%<br/>\nresist rate, the procs increased the Yak&#39;s damage rate by 15%.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This means little if you are <br/>\n&gt; fighting short battles.

When you talk about damage over time, that by<br/>\ndefinition means you&#39;ve taken the duration of the battle out<br/>\nof the equation.  The only time it matters is in very short<br/>\nbattles, ones lasting approx 1-3 combat rounds.  In battles<br/>\nthat short, the discrete nature of the attacks (damage comes<br/>\nin lumps, not continously) favors slow, high damage weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; these factors come into play. You are dealing with mobs that have upwards of <br/>\n&gt; 12K hp. Most fights are quite long, the majority of Ykesha procs are <br/>\n&gt; resisted, and the Yaks suck stamina quite nicely in long drawn out fights. <br/>\n&gt; Of course any bard with his mandolin will twist Jig in as needed in any <br/>\n&gt; fight. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Other than -10 str, -10 sta, I have not noticed any bad<br/>\neffects of being low on stamina.

Some people live by the proc, <br/>\n&gt; others live by the ratio. After having been beat down more than enough times <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve decided to shitcan my Yaks that I&#39;ve owned and loved for 6+ months. And <br/>\n&gt; let me tell you, my cleric spends a LOT less mana on me, and can worry more <br/>\n&gt; about keeping the real tanks alive in my party.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suspect that with the procs, the Yaks will even outdamage<br/>\nour planar weapons.  But I completely agree that the procs<br/>\nwill make you the focus of the mob.  Even with a six-note and<br/>\nWaki, I&#39;m often able to pull mobs off my taunting warrior<br/>\nfriends by sheer virtue of my songs alone.  Still, it might be<br/>\nnice to swap in a Yak from time to time for those situations<br/>\nwhere it seems you&#39;re never being attacked.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
