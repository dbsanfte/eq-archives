As a result, I can&#39;t post this question on EQVault.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night while adventuring in Lesser Faydark, my party was attacked by the<br/>\nSpider Queen (can&#39;t remember her last name).  I had never seen this NPC<br/>\nbefore so perhaps this is part of a new quest.  I do know we killed a lot of<br/>\ngiant spiders so that may have caused her to spawn.  Anyway, after we killed<br/>\nher, I looted an item called a pulsating brood clutch.  Right-clicking on<br/>\nthe item only displayed the name and the weight.  Didn&#39;t mention anything<br/>\nlike Lore/Magic item.  I asked around and no one had ever heard of this<br/>\nitem.  I went to a shop and was offered 7PP for it.  Thinking it may be a<br/>\nquest item, I decided not to sell it.  I also looted a poison sac from the<br/>\nQueen. The icons for the two items are similar, both looking like a kidney.<br/>\nMy guess is if this item is not a quest item, it can be used by a rogue to<br/>\ncreate poison, although I don&#39;t think this skill has been implemented yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any information on this item?  I need the PP but if its<br/>\npart of a quest would like to try and solve it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, I saw three other named NPCs in Lesser Faydark last<br/>\nnight.  One was Crookstinger, a NPC wasp, another was a named fairie whose<br/>\nname I can&#39;t recollect, and the unicorn Equestrielle.  In addition to the<br/>\nSpider Queen, I had never seen any of these NPCs before.  There were several<br/>\ngroups in the area attacking both wasps and fairie creatures.  The general<br/>\nconsensus of everyone in the area was that killing these creatures caused<br/>\nCrookstinger and the named fairie to appear.  No one was foolish/brave<br/>\nenough to attack the unicorn.  Its good to see that Verant has started to<br/>\nbeef up some of the zones.  Has anyone notived similar additions in other<br/>\nzones?  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
