What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am wearing the shin<br/>\n&gt;greaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I have never seen<br/>\n&gt;anyone else with legs that are this color.  They appear to be a rose tinged<br/>\n&gt;silvery hue on me and ever since I put them on I constantly get &quot;XXXXXX is<br/>\n&gt;examining your equipment&quot; or whatever that message is.  The wood elf <br/>\n&gt;females<br/>\n&gt;I have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged.  Is this the<br/>\n&gt;normal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?  If the rose color is <br/>\n&gt;normal<br/>\n&gt;then I guess I have never seen any wood elves in steel plate on E&#39;ci.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKitasi </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
