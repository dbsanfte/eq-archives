The other classes still have a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; usuable spell, while our song is completely worthless till they fix it.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I don&#39;t understand why you all think it&#39;s broken for casters?<br/>\n&gt;   They cannot cast levitate on themselves while they are already<br/>\n&gt;   levitating - so what?  They never did that before, that I can<br/>\n&gt;   tell.  You lose lev, remem lev, and recast lev.  The only person<br/>\n&gt;   I saw jamming on levitate like 50 times was a GM to make him rise<br/>\n&gt;   high above anyone.  And it&#39;s my belief why they attempted to <br/>\n&gt;   correct levitate due to the people who would levitate themselves <br/>\n&gt;   over and over to heights where they could easily overcome obstacles.<br/>\n&gt;   (The ledge in Permafrost to Lady Vox comes to mind)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OMG! (picture a light bulb over my head at this point) Your last<br/>\nstatement caused it. That&#39;s why they screwed up levitate. As usual, this<br/>\nis another ill thought out, badly implemented nerf of something they<br/>\nconsider an exploit for dragon killing. Every bloody nerf lately has<br/>\nbeen because of their precious dragons and this looks like yet another.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate to sound paranoid here, but hasn&#39;t anyone else noticed this? Look<br/>\nat the transcripts from Smedley&#39;s appearance at the monk sit in. He<br/>\nadmitted that that was why they nerfed feign death as well, and the<br/>\nhistory of many other nerfs has related right back to the nerfed<br/>\nskill/spell/whatever being used to kill dragons or recover bodys semi<br/>\nsafely after failing. The only difference here is that this one wasn&#39;t<br/>\neven tested on bards, just like our songs aren&#39;t even tested before<br/>\nbeing put in production.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf (and I&#39;m not sure it would be worth it yet) bards are going to<br/>\nprotest with a sit in, it should be over the testing issue, not this<br/>\nspecific incident. It really looks like either they don&#39;t have someone<br/>\nat Verant who &quot;owns&quot; bards, both from a programming and testing<br/>\nstandpoint, or if they do, it&#39;s someone who is incompetent or doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncare.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
