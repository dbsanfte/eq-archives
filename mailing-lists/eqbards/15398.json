My group consisted of me (35 bard), 33<br/>\nranger, two 35 druids, and a 37 enchanter.  We camped in the bartender room<br/>\nin Sol A trying to get a armor component for the ranger.  Everything we<br/>\nfought conned either blue or green to me.  During combats, I weaved Chant of<br/>\nBattle, Largos, and Psalm of Cooling.  I switched to Elemental and Pixie<br/>\nStrike if we faced a wizzie or shaman.  Over the course of 4 hours in that<br/>\nroom, I never lost more than a bub of health.  It was very difficult for me<br/>\nto even get something to attack me.  Standard taunt factors from the other<br/>\nplayers that came into play were 1) ranger did more melee damage than me, 2)<br/>\none druid did more damage with lightning spells, 3) one druid was full time<br/>\nhealer, 4) enchanter was doing crowd control.  In the past, even with the<br/>\ntaunt factors of the other players considered, weaving the three songs I was<br/>\nusing was usually enough to get all the mobs focused on killing me.  For<br/>\nlast night, most likely explanation would be either 1) bard hate was<br/>\nactually reduced or 2) enchanter crowd control overrode bard hate.   I&#39;m<br/>\ninclined to believe it was the enchanter that caused the mobs to ignore me.<br/>\nCould have been a completely different story if no enchanter is around and I<br/>\nhave crowd control duties. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, February 24, 2000 7:55 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Bard Hate (was Permafrost King Room)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More evidence for reduced bard hate.  I joined Rokenn&#39;s guild<br/>\n&gt; for a Vox attempt last night (4 failures).  The last one,<br/>\n&gt; somehow I lived.  I played resists the entire battle.  When<br/>\n&gt; all three melee people and the cleric in my group died, I was<br/>\n&gt; at a bubble and a half so I meleed Vox a bit, healed the<br/>\n&gt; (still alive) enchanter, meleed the priest of Nagafen and some<br/>\n&gt; ice giants a bit.  I was expecting to get summoned at any<br/>\n&gt; moment, but I ran around doing all this for about 3 minutes<br/>\n&gt; with nothing happening.  I didn&#39;t know what to do because it&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; never occurred to me that I might live.  Eventually I zoned.  <br/>\n&gt; I think I was the only melee person to survive.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OTOH, the first try, I played my resist song for a couple<br/>\n&gt; rounds, Vox summoned me, and clawed me to death right off the<br/>\n&gt; bat.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
