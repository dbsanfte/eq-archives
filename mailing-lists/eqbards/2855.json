The<br/>\n&gt; idea<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is that others would then have a chance to kill the <br/>\n&gt; monster and get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; weapon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t stop this at all - it just pretty <br/>\n&gt; much ensures<br/>\n&gt; that the folks doing the camping have moved well beyond the <br/>\n&gt; need for the<br/>\n&gt; item themselves, pretty self-defeating.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The thing I love about EQ above all else - is the benefits <br/>\n&gt; and incentives<br/>\n&gt; of cooperation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is one area (really the only one I&#39;ve noticed) that goes <br/>\n&gt; against that<br/>\n&gt; model (and only in certain instances).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m also one that&#39;s big on the economic side of a world like this - if<br/>\n&gt; given the option between warrior and merchant - I&#39;d pick <br/>\n&gt; merchant every<br/>\n&gt; time, hands down - now in EQ - gotta be both....ok.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, the post I saw about total group damage in terms of <br/>\n&gt; looting rights -<br/>\n&gt; that sounds promising - true, a group of high levels could effectively<br/>\n&gt; block out a spot, however, I doubt you&#39;d find high levels <br/>\n&gt; grouping for this<br/>\n&gt; purpose nearly as often as lower level guys for an item - <br/>\n&gt; high levels have<br/>\n&gt; better things to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My original post only suggested that lore items equipped in <br/>\n&gt; inventory slots<br/>\n&gt; not count towards the limit total - this will have a benefit <br/>\n&gt; to appropriate<br/>\n&gt; level players - and will be of very little difference for higher level<br/>\n&gt; players that have moved onto better equipment. It still <br/>\n&gt; allows them one for<br/>\n&gt; merchant purposes - which is not at all unacceptable to me from a<br/>\n&gt; merchant&#39;s point of view - but it still only allows one in <br/>\n&gt; the inventory or<br/>\n&gt; bank for resale at a time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
