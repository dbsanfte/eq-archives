If you tend to have a high number of deaths per<br/>\nlevel as I know many of you do, this can really screw you up.<br/>\nWhereas before you were taking 5 steps forward and 2 steps<br/>\nback for a net gain of 3 steps a night, at 31 this can turn<br/>\ninto 5 steps forward and 6 steps back for a net loss of 1 step<br/>\na night, even though you are gaining experience and dying at<br/>\nthe exact same rate as before.
