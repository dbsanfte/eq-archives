By L45 plus, I would guess most druids have a<br/>\ncircle of friends they adventure with, but when everything they cast at<br/>\nFire Giants is resisted _100%_ when the druid is L50 there is something<br/>\nout of balance. The other night when we went after Tranix, even the<br/>\ndruid&#39;s ice based spells were resisted 100%. Now if makes some sense<br/>\nthat fire based creatures would have a higher than average fire resist,<br/>\nbut ice??? This basically reduced the druid to the role of poor healer<br/>\nand gater. Meanwhile a L49 wizard&#39;s spells were getting through a lot<br/>\nmore consistantly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I thought we had a couple high level songs which lowered<br/>\n&gt; monster resists?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At L46 our 3 magic resist lowering songs were resisted 100% of the time<br/>\nby the ice giants. To bring this a bit back to the theme of the list,<br/>\nhas anyone else noted that even though the chant scrolls say they are<br/>\npercussion, playing a drum doesnt appear to make a darn bit of<br/>\ndifference? I tested chant of flame and chant of ice on myself with my<br/>\nMistmoore drum and playing a drum makes no difference either in the<br/>\ndamage taken or the amount of resistance lowered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
