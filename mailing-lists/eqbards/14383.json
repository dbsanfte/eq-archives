I <br/>\nhave a few follow ups if you do not mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Why do we not have the ability to play Invisibility and See Invisibility <br/>\nsongs together? Or perhaps allowing our see invisible to be played on top of <br/>\na casters invisible or camouflage?<br/>\nA: Any effect that hits you while invisible turns you visible. We recently <br/>\nadded the See Invisible component to the Bard´┐¢s invisibility song - this <br/>\nshould help the problem. (Or you can just follow the cool sparkles)<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow up: As you most likely know by now this change did not go live on the <br/>\n2/3/2000 patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Is Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (Lvl 15) supposed to have a memory blur <br/>\ncomponent?<br/>\nA: Nope.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow up: The old spell lists from Beta indicate that Lullaby nix&#39;d the <br/>\nhate list.  And in the first few months of retail it did so as well (work <br/>\nvery well when partnered with a wizard or rogue).  Now the hate list nix&#39;ing <br/>\nno longer seems to work.  Was this removed, or is this a function of using <br/>\nthe song on higher level mobs?<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Ok this is a personal question and probably completely trivial, the <br/>\nenameled black chestplate from lower guk is a black plate that is wearable <br/>\nby all the plate wearing classes except Bard. I wear an inferior black plate <br/>\nbecause I like the black plate look, can this plate be made available to <br/>\nBards?<br/>\nA: No reason. I changed it so that Bards can use it too - should be in this <br/>\npatch.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow up: Now if there where only some black plate arms and bracers that <br/>\nwere bard wearable.  My woodelf wants to channel Johnny Cash.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Are there enhanced effects for these songs when the proper instrument is <br/>\nequipped? In the case of Aquatic Ayre, is the enhancement range increased? <br/>\nFor Sirens and Pixie Strike, does it increased duration, chance of success, <br/>\nor both?<br/>\nA: Instruments only effect the primary effects of the song (healing, buff, <br/>\nattack speed, etc.) - not the range/duration/chance of success, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow up: The instrument portions of Fufil´┐¢s Curtailing Chant, Tuyen´┐¢s <br/>\nChant of Flame, and Tuyen´┐¢s Chant of Frost are still broken.  Using an <br/>\ninstrument does not increase the damage or the resist debuff.  Also contray <br/>\nto one of your earlier posts McVaxius Berserker Crescendo does not require <br/>\nan instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Can you explain your thoughts behind Psalm of Purity and Psalm of <br/>\nVitality? These songs are simply useless since any 5th level druid and 4th <br/>\nlevel cleric can cure the disease and poison these songs are supposed to <br/>\nprotect from. I mean truly 39 points of disease protection for a 29th level <br/>\nsong?<br/>\nA: These songs, in addition to protecting from poison and disease, also have <br/>\nchances to remove a poison or disease effect on you. They are a mixture of a <br/>\ncure and a resistance buff in one.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow up: Several bards I know have tested the curative aspect of these <br/>\nPsalms in the past and found this not to work.  Is the chance of a cure very <br/>\nlow?<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each of the <br/>\nfollowing: Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon, Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre, Solon&#39;s Song <br/>\nof the Sirens, Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike, and Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles?<br/>\nA: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance, none.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow up: If Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens is not enhanced by using a wind <br/>\ninstrument then why is it listed as a wind song?  Also using a wind <br/>\ninstrument with Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike does NOT increase the MR debuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you again for adressing these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
