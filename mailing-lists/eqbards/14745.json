If you play Nethack, you will notice the same types of<br/>\n&gt;problems with their RNG (random number generator) There is no<br/>\n&gt;perfect way of doing this. Just lots of options. Amazingly<br/>\n&gt;enough, generating a true random number is not as easy as it<br/>\n&gt;sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ohh I like this subject :o)<br/>\nActually most random generators will give fairly random numbers (depending on<br/>\nwhat application youre using it for offcause) if you just use em right. The one<br/>\nin Standard c (as far as I remember) is based and seeded with a 16bit value..<br/>\nThe trick, if you dont want to destroy the whiteness (and uniform distribution)<br/>\nof this function is to NOT seed it ever again. just let it run its course and<br/>\nyou will get 2^16 different values which is infact very much random before the<br/>\npattern repeats it self.<br/>\n Now the kind of random numbers you would want in a game should be a uniform<br/>\ndistribution (Every number has the same proberbility to show up) and it is<br/>\nrather simple with sufficient output from the rand function to determine wheter<br/>\nthis holds true or not.<br/>\n I would guess that the generator used in EQ itself is infact very uniform<br/>\ndistributed, but when you take a signal with _any_ ditribution and puts it<br/>\nthrough a linear system/function. The output will change towards a gausian<br/>\ndistribution. With a gausian distribution most numbers will be most likely to<br/>\nturn up around the center (if rand&#39;s range is 0 to 1 most numbers will be around<br/>\n0.5). I dont think the latter is the case, but I dont know much about games or<br/>\nthe functions they might use for calculating succes/failure. I just know that<br/>\nthe standard random generators would give atleast 2^16 uniformly distributed<br/>\nnumbers before it repeats it self. Since 2^16 numbers are enough for most of<br/>\nwhat I do I havent spent time looking into what happens if you go beyond that. I<br/>\nexpect that you will start seeing a system in the numbers.<br/>\nHumm well if people are interested in Rand functions you should go here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ulib.org/webRoot/Books/Numerical_Recipes/bookcpdf.html\">http://www.ulib.org/webRoot/Books/Numerical_Recipes/bookcpdf.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEnough rambling from me today..
