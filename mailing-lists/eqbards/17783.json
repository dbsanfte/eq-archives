I logged back in<br/>\nthe next day and found myself in a canoe in the middle of the ocean no where<br/>\nnear land.  Maybe I switched places with some other explorer?  It seems to<br/>\ndepend on what has happened to the canoe you camped in in the meantime.  If<br/>\nit hasn&#39;t despawned you definitely reappear in the canoe wherever it is<br/>\ncurrently.

Hey Rylos!  I have had some zoning issues as <br/>\n&gt; well, both in<br/>\n&gt; Lavastorm and OOT.  I zoned into OOT from Butcherblock, only <br/>\n&gt; to find myself<br/>\n&gt; on the sister isle.  This has happened a couple of times and <br/>\n&gt; is a real pain<br/>\n&gt; as the Freeport bound boat no longer stops there.  I have <br/>\n&gt; also zoned in and<br/>\n&gt; found myself on the bottom of the world.  There was no escape <br/>\n&gt; from this<br/>\n&gt; situation, so I had to wait for a guide to show up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lavastorm hasn&#39;t dropped me in Lava yet, but I have zoned <br/>\n&gt; from Najena into<br/>\n&gt; OOT.  That was truly bizarre, especially since I was actually <br/>\n&gt; headed to<br/>\n&gt; Butcherblock.  I&#39;ve also zoned out of Najena and appeared in <br/>\n&gt; Najena near the<br/>\n&gt; Tentacle Terror room.

I<br/>\n&gt; have zoned out of Najena into a pool of lava.  The guide <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t bat an eye<br/>\n&gt; about rezzing me so I figured it must happen quite often.  I <br/>\n&gt; also had an odd<br/>\n&gt; occurance happen last night.  I was zoning from Nektulos and <br/>\n&gt; had a couple<br/>\n&gt; guards on me.  and while zoning was disconnected several <br/>\n&gt; times.  When I<br/>\n&gt; finally got back in I was in the NE corner of the zone rather <br/>\n&gt; than by the<br/>\n&gt; zone line.  I have only had this happen when zoning from <br/>\n&gt; Oasis and dropping<br/>\n&gt; in near the grassy section of N Ro.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rylos Darmadrigal Bard of the 21st (almost 22nd) chorus on E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; 1.6 Million Digital Images!  <br/>\n&gt; Download one Today from Corbis.com<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3356/7/_/451022/_/955654837/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3356/7/_/451022/_/955654837/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; RIVER BELLE CASINO - $25 FREE! <br/>\n&gt; Download the FREE Software, <br/>\n&gt; Open a Real Account and WIN!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/2968/7/_/451022/_/955655284/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/2968/7/_/451022/_/955655284/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nRIVER BELLE CASINO - $25 FREE! <br/>\nDownload the FREE Software, <br/>\nOpen a Real Account and WIN!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/2968/7/_/451022/_/955655516/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/2968/7/_/451022/_/955655516/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
