It was <br/>\n&gt; my first time down there. As I finished zoning, it said &#39;You <br/>\n&gt; have entered <br/>\n&gt; old ruins of guk. (is that lower guk?)<br/>\n&gt;    I zoned in as a higher level dude was slaying a shin ghoul <br/>\n&gt; knight; the <br/>\n&gt; very mob (one of) from which I need to loot a lambent quest <br/>\n&gt; item. I had my <br/>\n&gt; invis song going as per usual. All through upper I noticed <br/>\n&gt; that everything <br/>\n&gt; was indifferent to me. YAY! Ok, song is working like a charm. <br/>\n&gt; I did manage <br/>\n&gt; to con the shin ghoul knight while he was being attacked. &quot;A <br/>\n&gt; Shin Ghoul <br/>\n&gt; Knight scowls at you, ready to attack. What would you like <br/>\n&gt; your tombstone to <br/>\n&gt; say?&quot; Um ok, first reaction is to zone, especially since he <br/>\n&gt; was just inches <br/>\n&gt; away  from me. The guy was using the zone line as a buffer, <br/>\n&gt; apparently. NP. <br/>\n&gt; Zoned... Went LD... That&#39;s where I am as it stands.<br/>\n&gt;    So, at 19 so far, from what I think is lower (?), can see <br/>\n&gt; through invis. <br/>\n&gt; Now, whether or not your invis ability increases as you level <br/>\n&gt; or not, is <br/>\n&gt; something i know zero about.<br/>\n&gt;    All I know is I was happy to get invis so I can get down <br/>\n&gt; to lower guk to <br/>\n&gt; get these items (shin greaves and gauntlets) before i had a <br/>\n&gt; chance to either <br/>\n&gt; go hunt there for exp, or get some faction hits somewhere else.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pava, Bard of the 19th measure<br/>\n&gt; Silent Dragons<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hmmm, I will have to give this a try in Lower Guk.
