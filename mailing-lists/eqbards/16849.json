I used to get the crap beat out of me<br/>\nwhen I used Dirge.  Up till this I figured the &#39;lower taunt&#39; everyone was<br/>\ndebating was just a pigment (I mean figment) of our imaginations.  Dirge<br/>\nused to have a pretty decent taunt factor.

I<br/>\n&gt; told<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them I&#39;d lead with Dirge as we ran in, which I did.  You&#39;d expect that<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; least one mob would have rushed me, but all 3 latched onto our warrior<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ran in (ie, he hadn&#39;t even taunted or hit anything yet.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been loading this song for kicks when doing Ogre bouncers recently.<br/>\n&gt; Once an hour, I get to feel like low level nuker :).  I&#39;ve used this song<br/>\n&gt; maybe 20 times?  Not once has a bouncer agro&#39;ed on me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other night we had a bad pull of 4 ogres and no enchanter.  We had a<br/>\n&gt; strong party so there was no question of zoning.  I took the opporunity to<br/>\n&gt; see if I could use the song to attract some attention to me to keep the<br/>\n&gt; Ogres off the cleric.  It was the first song I fired up in combat, hit all<br/>\n4<br/>\n&gt; for the full damage and not one of them agroed on me... All 4 kept beating<br/>\n&gt; on our tanks.  Heck, the procs on my Kisch or my Ykesha have a ton more<br/>\n&gt; taunt value then the dirge!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Taneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 45th (almost 46th) song<br/>\n&gt; Prexus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
