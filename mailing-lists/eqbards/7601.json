The guy<br/>\nwho wrote the report went there on the test server.  Apparently this zone is<br/>\nnot intended to be a standard adventuring zone but a quest-oriented zone.<br/>\nSupposedly, no matter what your race or class, all the NPCs in there  /con<br/>\nindifferent to you.  The quests are supposed to be class specific and each<br/>\nNPC is supposed to give multiple quests.  Its possible that the quests are<br/>\nall connected and that when you finish the final quest, you get a nice item<br/>\nusuable by your class only.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone been on the test server since the zone was added to confirm if<br/>\nbard only quests were implemented?  If there were, the letter we are sending<br/>\nto GZ may need to get revised to remove that concern.  If there isn&#39;t a bard<br/>\nNPC in Solusek Ro, then perhaps it should be revised to also voice a concern<br/>\nabout the lack of a bard quest in Solusek Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQLizer URL:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gameznet.com/eq/\">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
