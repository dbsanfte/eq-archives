That&#39;s one of the main<br/>\nreasons when they upgrade a Dragon or a God the first things to get upped<br/>\nare the AE effects, because they ignore the hate list and hurt everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn planes you can notice it in two ways.  One, bards dying more<br/>\nthan any other class, because the song ticking keeps them high on the<br/>\nlist.  Two, which I&#39;m not sure happens as much to bards because of reason<br/>\none, is the fact that my cleric gets a faction message about 1 in every 30<br/>\nor so kills in hate, because normally I don&#39;t cast anything near the end<br/>\nof a fight and I&#39;m not on the list, hence no faction hit.  If you get the<br/>\nkilling blow, on the other hand, you will * always * get a faction<br/>\nmessage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t really work against mobs that<br/>\n&gt; normally are ready to attack you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tYeah, you can&#39;t just cons them.  However, after a while you can<br/>\nmake a judgement call as to whether you&#39;re still on the hate list or not.<br/>\nI successfully camped my clerics out against the Maestro despite being oom<br/>\nand at 1 bubble of health during an attempt in which didn&#39;t even buff up<br/>\nfor (and hence Maestro reminded us we should know better and promptly<br/>\nflattened us).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMiriana<br/>\nLegions of Darkness<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
