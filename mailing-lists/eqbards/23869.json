I haven&#39;t played in a lot of pickup<br/>\ngroups, but have done a bit.  And until now, I&#39;ve not heard this phrase<br/>\nuttered.  I thought I had escaped it.  But noooooooooo... the pickup group I<br/>\ngot last night was the WORST I&#39;ve had in EQ that I can remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers: Bardette, Monk, Ranger, Paladin, Shaman, Wizard (all between 43 and<br/>\n45)<br/>\nScene: Solb<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wizard &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be playing manasong?&quot;... me... &quot;uh, I am&quot;...<br/>\nher...&quot;well just play it all the time&quot;.... me ... &quot;nope&quot;... her... &quot;well you<br/>\naren&#39;t a very good bard are you?&quot;... me... &quot;nope&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paladin &quot;Tani, you need to play regen now&quot;... me ... &quot;well this song<br/>\ndoes both so just sit tight&quot;... her...&quot;well i want to regen first then get<br/>\nmana&quot; ... me.. &quot;that&#39;s nice&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nOk so I was a little sarcastic, but I wont even get into the pulling<br/>\ntechniques used by the ranger... Needless to say, I took the advice of<br/>\nsomeone here and with a &quot;OMG I think my roommate just dropped something bad<br/>\n.. heard a crash have to go check it out&quot;.. I logged... but wowowowow...<br/>\nwhat an experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you all had a nice weekend and a little laugh from my story :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
