To recap, my system is:<br/>\n1.0 GHz, AMD<br/>\n256 MB PC-133 RAM<br/>\nCreative Ahnniliator Pro (GeForce 256 DDR)<br/>\nSB Live Xgamer 5.1<br/>\n20GB 7200 RPM Drive<br/>\nDX8.1<br/>\nWin98 SE (fully patched through Windows Update)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy testing was not comprehensive.  I did a comparison 3 different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing I did was defragment my hard drive.  After that, I started<br/>\nto experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\nUseTnL=FALSE - I&#39;ve had to leave that in my eqclient.ini file.  When I<br/>\nenable hardware T&L, all the colors look faded, and washed out.  Keeping it<br/>\nset to false, my colors look the way they should.  I switched back and<br/>\nforth, and the washed out colors appeared to be the biggest issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nOption Settings - I have the new textures loaded.  All tries were at<br/>\n1024x768 resolution, and texture compression off.  The third checkbox on<br/>\nthat screen (lower left), can&#39;t remember what it was...hehe...but it was ON<br/>\nfor all tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst - No models checked, except horse and elementals.  Socials off,<br/>\ndynamic lighting on, level of detail high, color depth 32 bit.  Very choppy.<br/>\nUnplayable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond - No models checked, except horse and elementals.  socials off,<br/>\ndynamic lighting off, level of detail medium, color depth 16 bit.  Choppy.<br/>\nProbably playable, but not in any raid situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird - 15 models (the number recommended at the screen) enabled, socials<br/>\noff, dynamic lighting off, level of detail low, color depth 16 bit.<br/>\nPlayable, but still not what I expected.  While turning with the keyboard<br/>\nwas fairly smooth, with occassional video skips, using mouselook to quickly<br/>\nturn and look cause pretty bad video skips.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is hope.  From what I&#39;ve heard guildmates say, the immediate solution<br/>\nis RAM.  I will be upgrading immediately to 512 MB of RAM, and then after<br/>\nthe holidays, will be running with three, 512 MB sticks.  It&#39;s cheap.<br/>\nApprox February or March, I will be splurging for the GeForce 3.  At that<br/>\ntime, I will do a test with EVERYTHING maxxed, and every option on.  Heh..it<br/>\nbetter be perfect.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also hoping that, as time goes on, Verant tweaks their EQ dx dll.<br/>\nThere is no reason for me to have to disable my hardware TnL.  I hope they<br/>\nfix that soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
