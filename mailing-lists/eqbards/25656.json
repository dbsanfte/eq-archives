With the release of SoL and all the new armor<br/>\nand weapons, there are many new attributes given to weapons. I have listed a<br/>\nfew weapons below. Some of the new weapons have various damage attributes<br/>\ngiven to some weapons. I have seen lots of different types. Some of that<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen are Fire Damage, Magic Damage,  Undead Bane Damage, Cold Damage,<br/>\nGrimling Bane Damage and many others I am sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know how these weapon will work? What kind of impact will these<br/>\nmodifications have on the damage output? Does a 10 damage 20 delay with a 4<br/>\ndamage undead turn into a 14 damage 20 delay verses undead mobs? I am sure<br/>\nthis can&#39;t be true, but I&#39;d sure like to know how this works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, other weapons are popping up with skill type bonuses. For example, I<br/>\nsaw a 2 hand blunt weapon that had a + 5 % to 2 hand blunt. Now does this 5%<br/>\ngo to your 2 hand blunt skill? Or is it that you will hit for 5% more<br/>\ndamage. How does this work. I also saw an item that had 3% lock picking<br/>\nskill gloves, a HtH held item that gave like 2% hand to hand. I am sure<br/>\nthere are a lot more of these to be found.<br/>\n<br/>\nI f anyone has any thought or knowledge on how these attributes affect the<br/>\nplayer, please post. I hope this was not too confusing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGrimling Bane Great Sword<br/>\n2 Hand Slash Weapon<br/>\n25 damage<br/>\n50 delay<br/>\n42 damage bonus<br/>\n4 Grimling - bane damage<br/>\n<br/>\nPallid Lance<br/>\n2 Hand Piercing<br/>\n24 damage<br/>\n32 delay<br/>\n22 damage bonus<br/>\n6 magic damage<br/>\n<br/>\nVius Warsword<br/>\n2 Hand Slash<br/>\n26 damage<br/>\n32 delay<br/>\n30 damage bonus<br/>\n10 magic damage<br/>\n<br/>\nWhite Fire dagger<br/>\n1 Hand Piercing Weapon<br/>\n9 damage<br/>\n20 delay<br/>\n11 damage bonus<br/>\n5 fire damage</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
