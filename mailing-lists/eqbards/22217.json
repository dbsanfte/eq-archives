Grrrrrrr.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kenneth E. Bachman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 31, 2000 1:45 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Change to bard song mechanics on Test!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the thing is bugged badly enough that it can&#39;t go live (or at least,<br/>\ndue to the stuck song problem,<br/>\ncan&#39;t stay live, I don&#39;t have enough faith in Verant to assume that they<br/>\nwon&#39;t put this into production as<br/>\nis), we don&#39;t really know what they intend here.  But I assume that they are<br/>\nattempting to &quot;fix&quot; the<br/>\n&quot;exploits&quot; that exist when a Bard turns on a song and leaves the computer.<br/>\nIf this is the case, it is yet<br/>\nanother utterly boneheaded modification to the class that completely ignores<br/>\ngame mechanics in general and<br/>\nBard mechanics in specific.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an Enchanter casts Clarity on a party, he can sit down to med, and then<br/>\ngo smoke a cigarette, or make<br/>\nlunch, or go to the bathroom, or take a quick trip to the hardware store.<br/>\nWhen a Bard (as currently<br/>\ncoded) turns on Mana song, he can do the same thing.  If this change goes<br/>\ninto effect, the Enchanter can<br/>\nstill leave, but THE BARD CAN&#39;T.  I can just IMAGINE what my party is going<br/>\nto say if I turn on Mana, go<br/>\naway to stretch my legs, and Mana breaks 5 seconds after I get up.  The same<br/>\ngoes for Shamans and trade<br/>\nbuffing (an example this poster used).<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it&#39;s possible for someone to log a Bard on, turn on Mana, set him to<br/>\n/follow the Cleric, and have the<br/>\nCleric get a mana boost that way.  But you can do THE SAME THING with an<br/>\nEnchanter, and you don&#39;t even<br/>\nhave to split experience with him!  You can do the same thing with ANY<br/>\nbuffing class.<br/>\n<br/>\nHell, I&#39;ve been in fights where the Warriors turned on autoattack and then<br/>\nsaid &quot;AFK&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the ONLY thing this really ends up correcting for is parking a Bard<br/>\nin a corner to get instrument<br/>\nskills up.  But I would wager quite a bit of money that there isn&#39;t a single<br/>\nBard on any server who has,<br/>\nfor example, maxed Brass Instruments skill through normal usage alone.  It&#39;s<br/>\nused too rarely, and it goes<br/>\nup much too slowly.  And that and wind instruments are really the only songs<br/>\nwe would do this with.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo Bards LEVEL too fast?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t begin to address what happens when you arbitrarily break group<br/>\ninvis (even if the Bard is AT<br/>\nthe keyboard) - you&#39;re all visible, and often dead; or levitation (same<br/>\nthing) - you all plummet to the<br/>\nground; or the level 51 travel song (same thing) - you&#39;re all visible AND<br/>\nyou plummet to the ground; or<br/>\nunderwater breathing (you have about 30 seconds here) - you all drown.  What<br/>\na nifty way to render 4 songs<br/>\nutterly useless in one fell swoop.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe US Department of Labor says that you should take a break from your<br/>\ncomputer at least once every half<br/>\nhour or risk serious health complications.  If they really make this change,<br/>\nwe&#39;re tied to our computer<br/>\nfor the entire time we&#39;re playing this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch as I gripe sometimes about their incompentent balancing with regards to<br/>\nBards, I still like the<br/>\nclass, and I hate to have to switch to something else.  Their &quot;play another<br/>\nclass&quot; response is really<br/>\nbogus when it takes 40 played days to get a character to a high enough level<br/>\nfor me to do things with my<br/>\nquasi-uber-guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do if they make a change like this.  I<br/>\nreally can&#39;t see continuing<br/>\nto play my Bard.  And I&#39;m not thrilled with the idea of having to level<br/>\nsomething else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they do this, it may be time to quit.  If I don&#39;t get myself banned.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Of course this will make Aria and Clouding instant death songs in many<br/>\n&gt; situations.
