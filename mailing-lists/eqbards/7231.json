Before<br/>\nlevel 20, many of the classes look exactly the same melee wise.  Sorry, but<br/>\na duel at lvl 16 is not an accurate judge of the abilities between 2<br/>\nclasses.  Before level 16 the combat is equipment based, the glowing wooden<br/>\ncrook (found on a level 24 or 25 lockjaw) is slightly above the level of the<br/>\nperson you&#39;re fighting.  Level 16 is very young in a character&#39;s career.  To<br/>\nbe honest, I would say that only aound level 25, when a character has had a<br/>\ndecent chance to equip themselves and they have most of the skills that<br/>\ntheir class will get do you get truly defining battles between classes.<br/>\nOnce you get dual wield, you will smoke a cleric in melee hands down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have only dueled a ranger in ranged combat only.  No contest he <br/>\n&gt; smoked me taking only 2 bubbles of health.  Of course he did use a <br/>\n&gt; bow which we cannot use.  Main problem was we were 16th at the time <br/>\n&gt; and he could camo and I could not.  He knew when he was in range, I <br/>\n&gt; did not.  He knew which way to run to get in range, I did not.  I am<br/>\n&gt; sure I could beat either if we used only spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ranged combat only between a bow wielding class and a non bow wielding class<br/>\nseems to me like it&#39;s always going to be pretty one-sided.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMiriana Windryder<br/>\nPriestess of Tunare<br/>\nInnoruuk Server<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGot Toast?   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.etoast.com\">http://www.etoast.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
