So after making a circuit and not seeing <br/>\nanything, we got real bold and went straight in. We found a tower very like <br/>\nthe underwater tower in Oasis. Not having found trouble yet, we swam up the <br/>\ntower and bingo! deepwater goblin started burning me up. I swam away from <br/>\nthe tower dying so fast I was hoping only to get my corpse out of range for <br/>\nrecovery. My partner was swimming suddenly bereft of the water breathing <br/>\nsong. He actually made it out alive, took one drowning hit before making it <br/>\nto air again, hehe. Fortunately I was bound to Arena. I recvoered my body <br/>\nhaving succeeded in placing it out of the deepwater&#39;s range. The L39 paladin <br/>\nfrom the guild who was in the area and came to make sure the adventuring <br/>\nbard didn&#39;t off herself again, said the gobs con&#39;d blue to him. We thought <br/>\nover some revenge but decided the gobs had us outnumbered and on their turf. <br/>\nSome day, revenge will come.<br/>\nFunny you should talk about Chief Dooga, when I started across the Lake <br/>\nbefore the cave adventure, I was on my way to join guildmates camping that <br/>\nvery same ogre camp. At the time I was being boiled, they also got stomped <br/>\nby an unpleasant mix of ogres and giants. I would have died had I followed <br/>\nmy original intent also. At least my way, I got to learn something new.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing new places and Dying there still,<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
