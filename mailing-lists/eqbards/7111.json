I have a sad feeling that is probably our<br/>\ncap, but I&#39;ll<br/>\ncheck next time I visit Freeport to be sure.  I strongly encourage all bards (and<br/>\nmonks<br/>\nand rogues) to practice and get this skill up there - it still doesn&#39;t work all the<br/>\ntime, but<br/>\nit has saved my life once or twice, and it frequently now makes battles a little<br/>\neasier to<br/>\nfinish up in groups.  A few pointers:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Yes, this skill is *sloooow* in raising, especially until you get it into the 40s<br/>\nor so.  I&#39;d<br/>\nrecommend in waiting to train it until you have 15-20 training points to waste,<br/>\ntherefore<br/>\npumping it immediately up into slightly useful range.<br/>\n<br/>\n-You do *not* need a valid target for the skill to increase.  Corpses, PCs, pets,<br/>\nand NPCs<br/>\nout of range will all check the skill and check for a skill raise.  So, don&#39;t think<br/>\nyou need to<br/>\nstand in front of some stationary guard to practice it.  When you&#39;re running across<br/>\nWest<br/>\nKarana, for instance, select a hapless player corpse, and hit instill doubt every<br/>\ntime it<br/>\nun-greys as you run across the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-If you happen to play on a team or PvP server, be *very* careful when you practice<br/>\nthis<br/>\non friends - I&#39;ve kicked people into trains, made them fall through the world...they<br/>\ntend to<br/>\nbe kind of mad afterwords. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Even when it gets high, you still won&#39;t succeed very often, mostly due to the fact<br/>\nthat the<br/>\nskill needs *4* successful checks to succeed:<br/>\n1) You need to not fail your instill doubt skill check.<br/>\n2) You need to not miss your kick.<br/>\n3) The monster needs to not parry/block/riposte/dodge/etc your kick.<br/>\n4) The monsters needs to non resist the fear spell check.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, don&#39;t expect miracles, but it is a nice, handy skill to have, and rather fun<br/>\ntoo. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lohengrin,<br/>\n    a scary bard on Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
