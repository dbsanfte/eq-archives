Does playing the song (increases int & wis)<br/>\n&gt;increase the base mana? Which would then help them in those marathon buff<br/>\n&gt;sessions pre-dragons, etc.  And can it be stacked with Clarity song?  Does<br/>\n&gt;it stack with 2 bards playing it in the same group?  If you stop playing <br/>\n&gt;it,<br/>\n&gt;does their mana volume decrease?  Ie: could it be used to &quot;mana buff&quot;<br/>\n&gt;casters prior to a big battle where they are gonna chain cast till OOM<br/>\n&gt;anyhow?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The way mana buffs (either +mana items or +stat items) work is that they <br/>\nraise your max mana level, not your current mana level.  So to take <br/>\nadvantage of the &#39;bonus mana&#39; you get you have to med up first.  Elergy will <br/>\nraise the max mana of the casters, so they would still need to med to get <br/>\nthe extra mana.  This is useless during a buff session, as the rate of <br/>\nbuffing is controlled by mana recovery time, not max mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nElergy could be used to give the mana munchers a bit of extra mana at the <br/>\nstart of a long battle.  You would need to play it and keep it playing till <br/>\nthey had medded to full then after they have let loose their first blast you <br/>\ncould stop playing and do what ever else is needed.  As when the int/wis <br/>\nbuff fades it will only lower their max mana not their current mana level.  <br/>\nGiven this, is it worth the effort? For most (if not all) Int casters in the <br/>\nmid to high 40&#39;s the answer is no.  As they can fairly easily get to 200+ <br/>\nint by then.  Most wis casters are usually at 200+ wis as well, except for <br/>\nShaman (esp Troll and Orge shaman).  Since they start with a much lower base <br/>\nwisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
