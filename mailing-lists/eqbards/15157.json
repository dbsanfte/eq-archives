I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think that a bard was invisioned in either of these specific applications.<br/>\nWhile I don&#39;t think that bards should have longer buffs where their songs are<br/>\nturned off, I do think there are actually some pretty good ideas for the quests<br/>\nor trade skills<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine that an Incandecent Gloves (I use enchanter because they are so involved<br/>\nwith everyone elses quest items- and I play one ) needed to have a bard sing a<br/>\ntune to change the Shadow Gloves to &quot;Resonant Gloves&quot;.  They shouldn&#39;t have just<br/>\nhad one class be involved in many of these quests.  In trade skills, image that<br/>\na bard was necessary to create even better armor/weapons- the bard can sing his<br/>\nsong to make sure that the metal used is &quot;pure&quot;, or that the seams are &quot;in<br/>\nharmony&quot; (giving them additional strenght).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust random thoughts<br/>\n<br/>\nPrevious Post:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;First, it makes sense, we sing a little song, people pay to hear it.<br/>\n&gt;This is a normal thing.  I find if odd that bards have no real ability<br/>\n&gt;that PC&#39;s will pay for (like most casters do).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>WRONG.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been paid for offering to sing a soothing song to someone shouting<br/>\nfor a heal in Blackburrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve often healed people using Heal Song, even. I am running by, see them<br/>\nway low on health, and say &quot;Mind if I sing you a song&quot; If they say &quot;Sure,<br/>\ngo ahead&quot; I hit invite and equip my lute.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just takes imagination and roleplaying :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\nMeara, level 14 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\nMystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaerain, level 19 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaesong, level 8 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Phoenix, Solusek Ro<br/>\n(Blackburrow)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
