Surely there<br/>\nare others that can provide what you are looking for.  I was very very<br/>\nhesitant about joining a guild (Karana server) because I saw some bad<br/>\nexamples of how some guilds treat even their own members. But, I had a dear<br/>\nfriend who gently encouraged me to join one, and never gave up on me, and I<br/>\nfinally joined, and couldn&#39;t be happier!  Kinship Of Valor is so very much<br/>\nlike a family, its amazing.  Giving and concern and comraderie are the<br/>\nnorm. And if anyone is ever in need, help is always on the way!  I love it!<br/>\n<br/>\nElwe, 30 songs<br/>\nBard of the Kinship of Valor<br/>\nKarana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
