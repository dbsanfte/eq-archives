I&#39;ve<br/>\nsuccessfully nodded (i.e. survived) 12 at once.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nunsuccessfully done 15 trying to hold them so my party could<br/>\nget away.  It definitely takes as my party ran off with only 3<br/>\nor 4 mobs chasing them, the other 11 or 12 stayed around with<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere *is* a limit of 4 mobs that can be attacking you at any<br/>\none time (might&#39;ve been lowered to 3, didn&#39;t really watch<br/>\nclosely this weekend).  If more than 4 aggro on you, the rest<br/>\nwill just ignore you until one of the original 4 dies.  So if<br/>\nyou&#39;re using an AE song, it can seem like it&#39;s only affecting<br/>\n4 at a time.  Just position yourself better so everything is<br/>\naffected.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
