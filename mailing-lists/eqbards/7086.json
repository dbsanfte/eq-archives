You appear on the ground some distance<br/>\naway. The song takes 5 seconds to &quot;re-act&quot; so if you plan to use it &quot;plan<br/>\nahead&quot; Ie: don&#39;t wait until someone is at a sliver of hp - it takes 5<br/>\nseconds (2 good rounds of Avo attacks) for the song to stick.  The down side<br/>\nis the party members will be spread out and somewhat disoriented - so brief<br/>\nthem ahead of time and even test it for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut having been camping KFC (so delete me) for more levels than I care to<br/>\nadmit, I can now run to the top floor - with Selo&#39;s and the drum and pull<br/>\nbirds without a problem.  The first time I went up there - I fell to my<br/>\ndeath just being disoriented and missing the small ramp.  Practice,<br/>\npractice, practice!  Now (or even 2 levels ago - prolly around 25) I can<br/>\njump off the top floor and live (I lose 3 bubbles of health though so its<br/>\nnot a viable option for pulling.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you move somewhere that causes the mob that is attacking you<br/>\n&quot;pathing problems&quot; (ie it for some reason cannot find a good way to run<br/>\nafter you - like some people who try to &quot;safe zone&quot; or trap mobs against<br/>\nterrain features) the mobs will now &quot;teleport&quot; to your immediate vicinity<br/>\nand continue their attack.  So, if you Melfious Motion and evacuate - the<br/>\nmobs will be along shortly - so you better immediately make tracks for the<br/>\nzone!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. aviaks are sometimes called &quot;chickens&quot; - you can guess why we call it<br/>\nKFC<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s. memorize this: /ooc Paw neg 3200 pos 800 <br/>\n(you will be typing that a lot if you hunt at Aviaks)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tReece, Tom - 25IDL G4<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, September 23, 1999 1:22 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Question about the teleport song<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI was fighting last night at the top of the aviak village in<br/>\nSouth Karana.<br/>\n\t\tFortunately everything went well and I never had to flee for<br/>\nthe zone border<br/>\n\t\tto escape death.  Had I been forced to do so I probably<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have<br/>\n\t\tsurvived because of the numerous ramps you have to use to<br/>\nget to the bottom<br/>\n\t\tof the village.  Since I won&#39;t get levitate for a long time,<br/>\nwas wondering<br/>\n\t\tif the teleport song would work in this situation.  If I<br/>\nsing that song<br/>\n\t\twhile at the top of the village (or any high altitude<br/>\nlocation), will I<br/>\n\t\tappear at the same altitude over the ground, and as a result<br/>\ntake lots of<br/>\n\t\tdamage due to falling?  Or will I end up on the ground<br/>\nwherever the song<br/>\n\t\tsends me to? <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThanks<br/>\n\t\tGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tShare your special moments with family and friends- send<br/>\nPHOTO Greetings<br/>\n\t\tat Zing.com!
