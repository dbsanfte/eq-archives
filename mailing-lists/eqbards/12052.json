People said that Druids and Shamans were<br/>\nthe &quot;Jack of all trades&quot;  I was saying that they really can&#39;t back that<br/>\nup since they can&#39;t melee at a decent level.  I was being flippant with<br/>\nthe pretend comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think bards melee is strong enough offensivly, just comes in a little<br/>\nshort on the recieving damage end.  Then again if we could tank better,<br/>\nthat would hardly be fair to the other melee types who don&#39;t get any (OR<br/>\nas much) magic.  We don&#39;t get a kick or bash, but could you imagine<br/>\ntrying to weave that into the whole triple woven song button mash?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
