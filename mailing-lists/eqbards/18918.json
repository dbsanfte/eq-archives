With the use of charm and mesmerise at high levels this is even more<br/>\ndangerous, yet Enchanters get no new tools to really help in this. Even<br/>\n700HP on Rune V won&#39;t last more than a couple of rounds, and at a cost of<br/>\n14p a cast.<br/>\n <br/>\nGZ: Actually, Bards are beat on more then any other class in the game. And<br/>\nno - Enchanters, need a party to help keep monsters off them - it is a<br/>\ndownside to being one of the most powerful classes in EQ. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
