Plus, let&#39;s think about it this way..<br/>\n<br/>\nThe upgrade is likely going to add many new zones, even continents, along<br/>\nwith a couple of races, maybe a class or two. Now, who&#39;s going to really<br/>\nWANT the expansion badly? Probably those who have invested days of time<br/>\ninto their characters and want something new to do! Imagine the outcry if<br/>\nVerant said &quot;OK, we&#39;re going to upgrade Xegony but not Fennin Ro, and<br/>\nBristlebane but not Tarew Marr?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, if they created an entirely new server with the upgrade, then what?<br/>\nWe&#39;ve wasted several months developing characters that are suddenly<br/>\nobsolete, as far as new things are concerned?<br/>\n<br/>\nNah, I have to agree here that Verant certainly has to find a way to slip<br/>\nthe new features right into the existing servers. I&#39;ll have no problem<br/>\npaying $20  for a couple of new continents, and horsies! Wheee!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Randy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Meridian had upgrades every 4 months or so. This way they get an additional<br/>\n&gt;boost in their cashflow to continue developing. I seriously doubt they will<br/>\n&gt;have seperate servers, that would be too much of a hassle for them...[hears<br/>\n&gt;them] Fixed bug A on server 1-10, but the fix didnt work on sever 11-20?<br/>\n&gt;Nope, they will require us all to upgrade. That way their devel. team keeps<br/>\n&gt;going in a straight line. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
