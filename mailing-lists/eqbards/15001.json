How do you involve or at least open the doors for<br/>\ninvolvement in some kind of ongoing saga to their whole customer base?  Or<br/>\nat least the ones who are interested as well as those befabled &#39;casual<br/>\ngamers&#39; And them keep things coordinated on all the servers.  Some guides I<br/>\nhave talked to tell tales of how extremely difficult it is to have  the<br/>\n&quot;same thing&quot; happen on all of the servers at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet part of the answer will be through re-capping and or previewing or<br/>\npre-registering participants through web sites where the saga info can be<br/>\ndistributed more efficiently (ie you dont have to be online at a give time<br/>\nto get the info you need for when you do go online.)  Any how - seems that<br/>\nthey are thinking about it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso go see the quest stuff from Paneel posted on EQ Vault (if you dont mind<br/>\nmild spoiler)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=810\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=810</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClipped from a post made by Abashi (Gordon?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe History of Norrath<br/>\n[Why did the Combine Empire fall? Is there a way to find out?]<br/>\n<br/>\nNot at this point. The history was meant to be revealed as part of in-game<br/>\ndynamic quests. However, it&#39;s been our experience that the stories either<br/>\ndon&#39;t get told, or don&#39;t get told correctly. We&#39;re currently working at a<br/>\nbetter way to distribute information, so that people who aren&#39;t able to<br/>\nparticipate directly can still understand what is going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Is it possible the world can be changed in a significant way, like Qeynos<br/>\ngetting burned to the ground or something? Or this this &quot;living, changing<br/>\nworld&quot; going to consist of modifying player abilities to simply make the<br/>\ngame harder?]<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a bit argumentative, because it makes the assumption that the game<br/>\nworld hasn&#39;t changed in the manner you suggest, when in-fact it has.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe change to Kithicor is a good example. How many people realize that there<br/>\nwas a constant storyline that took over 6 weeks to complete with nearly 2<br/>\ndozen dynamic quests completed across all servers? How many people actually<br/>\nknow the story, compared to the number that think one day the GMs just<br/>\ndressed up and ran around killing newbies?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be interested in discussing your ideas in regards to how these<br/>\nhappenings can be explained to everyone.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
