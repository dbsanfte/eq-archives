If this is in fact true, will there be<br/>\na problem with the deepwater goblins (or other water<br/>\nnasties) if I swim around the edge just to get<br/>\nfrom zone to zone?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for all the help. I love to travel<br/>\nand these two zones are 2 of about 10 that I have<br/>\nyet to be in, in some fashion or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for invisibility, I don&#39;t yet have it nor does<br/>\nhe. It&#39;s not always easy to find people willing to<br/>\nhelp you out with that either; unfortunately.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
