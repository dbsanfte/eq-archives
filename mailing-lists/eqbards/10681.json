I was grouping in SolusekA early last<br/>\nweek with a warrior, paladin, and 2 wizards.  We had been grouping for about<br/>\n3 hours when I started realizing what all I was doing.<br/>\nFirst I was singing Anthem, increase attack speed and strength.<br/>\nSecond I was singing psalm of warmth, damage shield for everyone in the<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\nThird I was Chaining them since all goblins just love to run.<br/>\nFourth I was using Pixie Strike against the casters - worked awesome by the<br/>\nway, out of around 10-15 shamans and wizards they got off maybe 5 total<br/>\nspells.<br/>\nFifth I was using the Curtailing Chant to lower MR and DoTing<br/>\nThen when this was over I was healing everyone up.<br/>\nNow what class can do all that, while at the same time doing quite a bit of<br/>\ndamage melee wise.  No one I tells ya no one.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a lot of the higher ups talk about becoming nothing but a mana bard<br/>\nwhen they get up to higher levels so I can&#39;t really say too much on that.<br/>\nBut right now I am having more fun with my bard than I have had in a long<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKurik Nitesong<br/>\n&quot;Only the Brave&quot;<br/>\n30th (hell sux) bard<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n___________________<br/>\nRobert Maze<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robert@...\">robert@...</a><br/>\nwww.fncinc.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeff Illian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 29, 1999 3:58 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Great post on item balancing (Long)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; IMHO, the bard class is just fine.
