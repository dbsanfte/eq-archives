Yeah, 1950<br/>\n&quot;something&quot;. And in the early 70&#39;s I corrupted my minor children with<br/>\nD&D, and later when the with the C-64 and Amiga machines.  <br/>\n...anyway, TG EQ wasn&#39;t out then. And I tried switching weapons and<br/>\ninstruments with my Bard, but on CAREFUL consideration, I figured out<br/>\nthat the DAM I missed in the &quot;downtime while switching&quot; just wasn&#39;t<br/>\nworth it. <br/>\n Before I move from level 47 to level 50, which I just reached it was<br/>\neasy. Equip a DRUM or Nostrolo&#39;s Tambourine and play yer heart out. With<br/>\n50, all of a sudden I have all these &quot;string&quot; options and am back to<br/>\nconsidering &quot;switching&quot; instruments. In fact, If they come up with the<br/>\n&quot;Bard as Tank&quot; Jonathan songs we may well have a really decent<br/>\ndiscussion on Tactics. I have in the past cut and pasted this forum for<br/>\nBards in my guild.... but why bother anymore, since there is only one or<br/>\n...maybe 2 playing the class....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
