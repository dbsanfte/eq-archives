True casual gamers aren&#39;t concerned that much with items<br/>\n&gt; and levels.  the only people upset by this statement are the power gamers<br/>\n&gt; who don&#39;t have time to put into the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Uhh that&#39;s not true at all.  Casual gamers are generally still interested in<br/>\nbeing able to participate in quests and adventures to attain neat or unique<br/>\nitems.  I would hazard that most &quot;Casual&quot; gamers would even like to some day<br/>\nreach high levels.  Even Role Players like to reach high levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll players should be able to participate in events.  The problem that I<br/>\nhave with most GM event&#39;s isn&#39;t that they are &quot;Stupid&quot;, however, it&#39;s that<br/>\nunless the GM&#39;s get very &quot;evil&quot; and start punting players who interfere<br/>\nthere is no way for a dynamic event to keep the 50&#39;s from ruining the fun of<br/>\nlow level events.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a Guide and I can tell you that MANY of the events are actually aimed<br/>\nat those around level 15 to 35 or so.  The problem is  that whenever one of<br/>\nthose events kicks off the 50&#39;s waltz in and blast the actors to smitherines<br/>\nbecause they think it may have neat stuff.  Which ruins the event for the<br/>\nplayers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me rephrase that:<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the GM&#39;s fault that the PLAYERS can&#39;t respect events enough not to<br/>\nruin it for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
