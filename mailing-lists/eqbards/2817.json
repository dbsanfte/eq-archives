HEHehehehe!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tallonn - Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yesterday I was hunting in CB, and thinking of lore stuff a lot - place is<br/>\nfull of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe change to only have one of any particular lore item - and making most<br/>\nof these items lore is one I applaude the intent behind, but it also raises<br/>\nsome NEW problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I WEAR the dwarven tunic (pending lore at the moment) what if<br/>\nI want to ALSO get the screaming mace - the tunic is a component.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example, I can&#39;t wield 2 dragoon dirks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I think it&#39;s a good thing that folks are discouraged from camping and<br/>\naccumulating a dozen of an item, and then squirrling them away, or hauling<br/>\nthem to the furthest reaches for sale - selling these items IS a legitimate<br/>\ntrade. By basically ruling out getting another, if you already have one in<br/>\nhand - you are guaranteeing that the folks hunting these critters are gonna<br/>\nbe higher levels - and have already moved past personal use of said item.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already noticed this shift. The only thing that it DOES help with -<br/>\nthey get one, move on to sell it, but then they are right back.  Since they<br/>\nare much higher levels, very easy to swipe a kill of one of these mobs from<br/>\nsomeone around the &#39;appropriate&#39; level to be hunting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis also of course presents a problem if your friend dies, gives you<br/>\nconsent to loot - and you BOTH have an item - his is gonna poof.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure what the answer to this problem is - I do think Verant had good<br/>\nintentions with this change, and I agree something needed to be done,<br/>\nhowever - is the way it&#39;s been implemented causing more new problems than<br/>\nit solved of old?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne change I think might mitigate the problems - and keep the original<br/>\nintent - let someone only have one of an item in their inventory or bank -<br/>\nbut equipped doesn&#39;t count. If item in question, say the tunic is equipped,<br/>\nit&#39;s not lore WHILE equipped (or is, but just doesn&#39;t count towards this<br/>\nrule) - you may have ONE in your inventory or bank as well - or the dragoon<br/>\ndirk, you may then wield two of them if you choose. Also solves the problem<br/>\nof looting a friends corpse if you happen to be equipped in a similar set<br/>\nof goods - or actually be able to hunt for ONE of an item to sell, and ONE<br/>\n(or two in the case of the dirk) to use - from a critter of appropriate<br/>\nlevel. In some cases - you might even want ONE in the bank - in case of<br/>\ndeath for personal use - not sure how corpses count, might need to make<br/>\nsure if equipping from you corpse directly to your inventory slots doesn&#39;t<br/>\naffect it. In any case, I think that might be the rarest scenario, and one<br/>\nshould visit the bank first to remove said item.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, there is no perfect solution to camping - Verant made a good<br/>\nfaith effort towards stemming it, if we could just get them to now address<br/>\nthe sideissues that the change itself made - I do believe we&#39;ll be a whole<br/>\nlot closer to the original intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatcha think?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
