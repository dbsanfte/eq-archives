Emergency Patch We","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-378162109\">Patch for Velious already:<br/>\n<br/>\nToday&#39;s patch requires that Velious subscribers press the &quot;Velious Patch&quot;<br/>\nbutton on the patch program UI.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmergency Patch<br/>\n<br/>\nWe appreciate everyone&#39;s patience while we address a few issues as tens of<br/>\nthousands of new players check out Velious. This emergency patch addresses<br/>\nseveral issues:<br/>\nThe transparent inventory screen will no longer come up in 640x480<br/>\nresolution. It was not supposed to come up as the available screen space is<br/>\nnot large enough to house the new screen.<br/>\n&quot;Disabled&quot; windows in full screen mode will no longer interfere with mouse<br/>\nclicks.<br/>\nAddressed some item drop bugs in Skyshrine that had the highest-level loot<br/>\ndropping off of yard fodder. This has been addressed with a retroactive item<br/>\nchange. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br/>\nSeveral disciplines (Resistant, Trueshot, Unholyaura, and Holyforge) have<br/>\nbeen upgraded. Please read the updated EQManual_Supplement.doc (or .txt) in<br/>\nyour EverQuest Directory.<br/>\n&quot;Dragon Circles&quot; have been fully implemented. In short, you will not be able<br/>\nto receive a teleport to a dragon circle unless you&#39;ve been to the circle<br/>\nbefore and carry a soulbound souvenir that spawns at the circle. Please read<br/>\nthe updated EQManual_Supplement.<br/>\nInnate class-based resistances implemented a year or so ago did not take<br/>\ninto account levels 50 through 60 with exception to those provided to the<br/>\nwarrior. As such, each class that has class-based resistance bonuses (with<br/>\nexception to the warrior) will get an additional bonus as they level from 50<br/>\nto 60.<br/>\nThe problem of blank faction messages being reported to the players has been<br/>\ncorrected.<br/>\nScreenshots are again enabled.<br/>\nOverall the Velious launch is going very well. We are happy to see that the<br/>\nproblems found so far are minor and that we can address them quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\nMy impressions:  WOOT!!  SoV is fun.  Mobs are very nice looking.  The dwarf<br/>\ncity has everything(have not found a bard trainer, but...).  Don&#39;t mess up<br/>\nthat faction.  Cantana was well received by the casters in my group.  And I<br/>\nonly saw one bard song.  Below said 4???  I wonder what they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, off to logon,<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 8<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 5 Dec 2000 15:21:04 -0600 <br/>\n   From: &quot;Mott, Mike J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.j.mott@...\">mike.j.mott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: Cantana of Soothing<br/>\n<br/>\nSPOILER ALERT..................I JUST PULLED THIS OFF WHINEPLAY....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSCROLL DOWN<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n..<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n..<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n..<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n..<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.Ok, Velious installed, parched and activated: <br/>\nDruid ring/circle and Wizard gate/portal spells for Iceclad Ocean are found<br/>\nin NK at the gypsies. They are level 34 spells like the Combine Ones. <br/>\nIt appears ( I forgot to grab /locs on both portals) that the Druid and<br/>\nWizard spells take you to the same location in Iceclad Ocean Zone. A note,<br/>\nwhen I ported in with my level 35 Druid, I was immediately attacked by blue<br/>\n/con mobs. My level 48 Wizzie was not attacked, but I think that is because<br/>\nnothing was near the porter &quot;shack&quot; when I zoned in. The mobs /con green to<br/>\nthe Wizzie. <br/>\nBarge to the Gnomish Icebreaker is caught in NRO at the new pier, just south<br/>\nof the Barbarian Fishing Village. Barge then zones into Iceclad Ocean and<br/>\ndrops you off on an empty island. You then need to run accross the island to<br/>\nthe other side to catch the Gnomish Icebreaker. You can&#39;t miss the dock.<br/>\nIcebreaker ride takes about 7 or 8 minutes to get you to the mainland. <br/>\nOnce you disembark from the Icebreaker, head left to the Gnomish Outpost.<br/>\nOne vendor there sells some of the new Velious Spells. I only saw 1 for each<br/>\nclass on him (except Bards had 4, go figure, hehe), and I was under the<br/>\nimpression that there was 2 for each class. So, as of yet, I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhere the other set is (if infact, there is another set). <br/>\nThat&#39;s it for now folks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
