A pair of necros helped clear<br/>\nthe way to my corpse (one of the frogs in jail could see invis).  My job<br/>\nwas to chain the frogs and minos.  Blue frogs resisted at least 50% if not<br/>\nmore without the charisma gear on my corpse (human, put a few points in<br/>\ncha, don&#39;t remember offhand, geared is 137).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter this incident, I am on a quest to gather as much charisma equipment<br/>\nas possible.  There are very few items we can wear that increase charisma<br/>\nin some slots (belt, back, shoulders, next to if not nothing).  The<br/>\ndexterity items that are available are excruciatingly rare drops, dragon<br/>\ndrops, or plane stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would highly recommend for starting buffs to use points in dex and cha.<br/>\nStrength is important yes, and you&#39;ll find yourself near encumbrance with<br/>\nonly armor on, especially with bronze.  I myself wore a full suit of<br/>\nbronze at one point (sans helm, chain is tolerable for now but plate is<br/>\nunbearable on human), and was left with maybe 4 stones worth of weight<br/>\ntill encumbrance set in (presong).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis period will pass.  If you bear with it, and suffer the weight, maybe<br/>\npick up a few +3str gold amber earrings or whatever the rings are for the<br/>\ninterim, a bloodstained mantle, studded collar (the +3 one, whatever that<br/>\nwas, maybe spiked), in the long run you&#39;ll be much happier having boosted<br/>\nyour other attributes instead of strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis assuming you spend most of your gametime at a relatively higher level<br/>\n(&gt;20).  If you&#39;re an extremely slow leveller, strength might be better of<br/>\nan attribute to contribute toward your utility gained from playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where might I find a Siryn Hair Hood?  EQlizer mentioned &quot;rare spawn in<br/>\nRathe Mountains,&quot; but no name was given.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren Notechaser, 37 measures and still composing<br/>\n&lt;The Revolution&gt; of Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
