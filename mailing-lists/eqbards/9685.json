You have 850 plat.  that is enough $ to<br/>\nstart getting lambent.  I am only lvl 23 and i have 2 lambent bracers and the<br/>\nlambent [arms].  I also have the Black Silk Gloves (looted last night..first<br/>\ntime in mistmoore) and a lambent stone....hopefully i will get the shin<br/>\ngauntlets soon.  My biggest problem has been the money, which you have got.  I<br/>\ncannot even run thru North Karana without hearing someone shout &quot;Free Griffenne<br/>\nCharm at Loc XXXX, XXXX&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, steel does look cool, and 1 or 2 ac is a significant difference.  But, you<br/>\ncan start questing for lambent now.  I try to avoid expenditures on stopgaps. <br/>\n(i am using Snakeskin Gloves, because i looted them myself at 11th lvl, and i<br/>\nwould rather save any extra resources becuase Elf Hide Gloves are a band-aid<br/>\nbetween Snakeskin and Lambent, IMSO)<br/>\n<br/>\nSIDENOTE:<br/>\nMistmoore is cool, but man those are some ugly trains.  Great for loot, bad for<br/>\nXP (at lvl 23 mind you)  I was in a group with a 28 Pal, 28 Cler, 27 Cler, 25<br/>\nDru, 24 Monk, and me.  The monk and i were just there because the others were<br/>\nbored i guess?  it was just the monk and i, and the other 4 straggled in and<br/>\nasked to join our group...weird.  But, i like grouping with people higher level<br/>\nthan me.  In spite of the danger, i get to learn alot about how the zone<br/>\nfunctions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone on Prexus have a Ice, Fire or Slime Crystal staff?
