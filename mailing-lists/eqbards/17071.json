NagaThin products are widely popular<br/>\nother parts of Norrath  for it&#39;s high protein and low fat content. &quot;It was<br/>\nvery successful&quot; said Mr. Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, CEO of NagaThin Industries,<br/>\n&quot;People were literally dying to get them&quot;. Pressed further Mr. E&#39;Taurguin<br/>\nadmitted that one  single person bought 80% of the inventory but that they<br/>\ndid in fact die trying to get them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the popularity was the low price. &quot;We wanted to get a feeling for<br/>\nthe actual needs of the marketplace so we priced them at 1pp for 20 to<br/>\nremove any reticence over price.&quot; said Mr. E&#39;Taurguin, &quot;Due mostly to<br/>\ntransportation costs as well as some risk of loss of life in distribution I<br/>\nbelieve the market price will settle around 3pp for 20 of either the Muffins<br/>\nor Milk products.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPlatinum was not the only gain from this marketing trial, upon arrival Mr.<br/>\nE&#39;Taurguin let it be known that as a one time offer, Shin Gauntlets were<br/>\nalso acceptable as payment. Within minutes a beaming druid was receiving her<br/>\ncase of NagaThin Milk, &quot;this is going to be great during downtimes&quot; she<br/>\nperked, &quot;and when people see me drinking Naga they are going to be happy to<br/>\noffer next in the loot order for a bottle of their own&quot;. Clearly a loyal<br/>\ncustomer, but was it really worth the gauntlets? &quot;duh&quot; she snorted, &quot;water<br/>\nis so last week, my friends and I are the NagaThin Generation&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeginning distribution was not without it&#39;s dangers. Mr. E&#39;Taurguin, a Bard<br/>\nby training was not entirely welcomed by the locals &quot;I have had some<br/>\nunfriendly dealings with Frogluks in the past, and upon arriving they made<br/>\nit clear they were ready and willing to attack me. But  being a Bard I sang<br/>\nmyself invisible and while short shout messages look unnervingly like the<br/>\n&#39;you feel yourself starting to appear&#39; message, everything went fine.&quot;. At<br/>\nthe end of the event Mr. E&#39;Taurguin stumbled upon the winning solution<br/>\nhowever: &quot;I began to regret my former dealings with the Frogluk people and<br/>\nwas pondering what I could do to raise their consideration of me. Then it<br/>\nhit me, I felt like an idiot I hadn&#39;t thought of it sooner&quot;. Playing upon<br/>\nthe lack of deep seated hatred towards him by the Frogluks, Mr. E&#39;Taurguin<br/>\nquickly called upon the NagaThin&#39;s Music Director Cinda Beemer who Mr.<br/>\nE&#39;Taurguin describes as &quot;a great asset to our marketing efforts&quot;. Singing<br/>\nMs. Beemer&#39;s  jingle &quot;Charismatic Carillon&quot; the Frogluks stopped attacking<br/>\nMr. E&#39;Taurguin, and while they still considered him as threatening, they did<br/>\nnot act upon their feelings &quot;good enough for me&quot; said Mr. E&#39;Taurguin &quot;there<br/>\nis just nothing like good marketing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNagaThin Industries is a privately owned company who is expected by analysts<br/>\nto make an Initial Public Offering within the year. After the Old Ruins Of<br/>\nGuk success, says Freeport Based Analyst Ton Twostring &quot;This  is a company<br/>\nto watch, very hot property, we are all somewhat frustrated they are not<br/>\nseeking venture capitol&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[NagaThin Industries wishes to thank well known travel consultant Adam<br/>\nWasserman for his efforts towards this great success]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
