Word is he is another 8 hour<br/>\n  spawn.  I&#39;m not certain how the mob tables work for spawns like<br/>\n  him, since I don&#39;t know who his placeholder is or where the spawn<br/>\n  point is.  It&#39;s really hard to say.  I stayed around for 3 hours,<br/>\n  wasted my time actually.  Needless to say, I got 5 cauldron shells<br/>\n  and around 15 water rings hehe. (well, noobs got them)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The cleric quests are almost impossible not because of the level of NPC <br/>\n&gt; required to kill them but because of the rarity of the NPC&#39;s that carry the <br/>\n&gt; items required.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I remember wandering the caves of everfrost for 5 friggin hours.  Talk<br/>\n  about boring.  I did ever little trick I heard to make that stupid <br/>\n  bear spawn.  (Another rumored 8 hour spawn)  Well, everything short<br/>\n  of killing Sulon Mcmoor.  Killed the ice goblin divers over and over,<br/>\n  killed all of the stationary ice bones.  Someone said there was a <br/>\n  roaming ice bone near the entrance and that it was the bear place-<br/>\n  holder.  Yet, I never once saw a roaming skeleton.  Most shamans<br/>\n  said they found the bear near the entrance, however.  I found the<br/>\n  big zero, and left with a stack of bones, and a few copper.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think instead of jumping on a rare as soon as I see it from now<br/>\n  on, I will instead study it&#39;s movement patterns and actions.  And<br/>\n  if I lose it or it vanishes, it will at least give more insight<br/>\n  into these super rare spawns.  Waiting around doing nothing is<br/>\n  a bitch.  I mean it&#39;s one thing when X mob spawns every 20 mins<br/>\n  and has a random chance of being the named one.  It&#39;s a whole<br/>\n  &#39;nother story when a ultrarare named roaming spawn with chance<br/>\n  of a placeholder is introduced.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s like that fisherman with the fishbone earing.  Or the oracle.<br/>\n  Or Karg Icebear.  No matter what they would always spawn at their<br/>\n  regular intervals.  There might be a placeholder but every 6 hours, a<br/>\n  wizard would gate in for the next 1/10 shot at the earring.  Every<br/>\n  7-8 hours, a druid would gate in to kite Karg for GZ.  At least<br/>\n  you had a shot at the thing you wanted, and you knew when to expect<br/>\n  it.  Having a monster placeholder for a spawn that is 8 hours is<br/>\n  absoultely ridiculous.  I don&#39;t envy clerics/shaman.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
