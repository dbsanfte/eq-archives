Here is what I do at level 35:<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapons:<br/>\nI put away the Blade of Fiery Lamentations and break out the  Staff of<br/>\nWrithing, with the Obsidian Shard I am now AE free on weapons and still<br/>\nkicking butt.<br/>\n<br/>\nSongs:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn combat (assuming the Enchanter knows their job and keeps the haste buffs<br/>\ncoming) I sing Psalm of Cooling, Clarity and Chant of Battle in combat. I<br/>\nhave Lament ready in case the Enchanter mezzes a large pull, I do this<br/>\nbecause if I don&#39;t and the mezz breaks the mobs are all over him/her. Lament<br/>\ngives the enchanter a chance the mobs will agro on me, and I can survive<br/>\nthat better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have Resist buffs and pixie strike ready for an unplanned caster-mob<br/>\nemergency.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the enchanter gets the casters mezzed I switch to horn and play Dennons<br/>\nDissention to drain them while they wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of ways to play nice with an enchanter, frankly I love<br/>\ngrouping with them. And any other casters love it too, Clarity and Clarity<br/>\nsong is a beautiful thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n<br/>\n(Hymn is the other song of course. There are some changes for outdoor as I<br/>\nneed selos, however, if there is a Shaman I just get a SoW and use the slot<br/>\nfor something else)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
