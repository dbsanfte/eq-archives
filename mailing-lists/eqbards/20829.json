A friend of <br/>\nmine ran <br/>\n&gt; me in since I was work-delayed, so I logged in an hour or so into <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; raid.  At the time, I had four pieces of visible blue Lambent:  <br/>\narms, <br/>\n&gt; legs, chest, head.  There were two Bards up there; the senior Bard <br/>\n(Jysa) <br/>\n&gt; had all of her Imbrued already.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As soon as I logged on, one of our pullers handed me some <br/>\nvambraces.  I <br/>\n&gt; looked:  Singing Steel!  They&#39;d found it in Sebilis the night <br/>\nbefore and <br/>\n&gt; decided to give it to me!  I&#39;d heard them talking about that in <br/>\n/guildsay <br/>\n&gt; the night before, but I honestly thought they were yanking my chain.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An hour in, some warrior greaves dropped.  The warrior who got them <br/>\nhad <br/>\n&gt; some guild-owned Mithril Greaves; my guild decided to give them to <br/>\nme, <br/>\n&gt; also!  The AC is less than Lambent, but I&#39;ve been sorely lacking in <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; STR department, so this was a welcome addition.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We killed Innoruuk (I went LD, even though I was staring at the <br/>\ncorner), <br/>\n&gt; then Maestro (the Lute rotted, since both Bards there had one), and <br/>\n&gt; went back to the west camp.  A few more Scorn Banshees and what <br/>\ndropped? <br/>\n&gt; A Bard Helm!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another hour or so, another Scorn Banshee.  What dropped?  A Bard <br/>\nBP!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I went from mostly blue to no blue at all in about four hours.  <br/>\nPretty <br/>\n&gt; nice day for me, I&#39;d say!  Pretty nice day for the guild as a <br/>\nwhole, <br/>\n&gt; too.  We got about 35 drops up there total, including 4 BP/Robes <br/>\n(Shaman, <br/>\n&gt; Bard, Mage, Enchanter).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 52 (&quot;I feel small&quot;) songs, Silent Justice, <br/>\nInnoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
