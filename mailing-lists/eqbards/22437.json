Here was","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-282234119\">Brilinnia Ban&#39;sidhe (currently playing unpack, paint, and hang curtains)<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOoh!  Unpack, Paint, and Hang Curtains!  I&#39;ve played that!  Here was my<br/>\nstrategy:<br/>\n<br/>\nAttack the paint first.  Twist Largo&#39;s Consonant Chain to ensure no drip<br/>\nmarks spawn.  Do NOT use Binding.  You do not want to reduce the AC of<br/>\npaint, trust me.  Also twist Vilia&#39;s Chorus of Celerity and Jig O&#39; Vigor to<br/>\nensure all the paint is dealt with before boxes or curtains start to spawn.<br/>\nI did this wielding a brush in my primary and can in my off-hand.  This<br/>\nmeant occasionally twisting Aria of Eagles in order to secure the zone.<br/>\nBut if you can afford it, go to Greater Fay and buy a two-handed,<br/>\nrechargeable, extended handle paint applicator.  It&#39;s more reliable than<br/>\nthe Aria and will allow you to twist Lyssa&#39;s Solidarity of Vision as needed<br/>\nif any of your group members go out looking for boxes too soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext attack the curtains.  Some would argue boxes should be dealt with<br/>\nnext, but I&#39;ve found that by the time you&#39;ve attacked all the curtains in a<br/>\nparticular zone you invariably find more paint spawn points that you missed<br/>\nthe first time.  And you want all the paint out of the way before you<br/>\ntackle the boxes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor curtains, use Aria of Eagles, Psalm of Cooling (Curtains have pets<br/>\ncalled Drafts which are very low-level but can make attacking the curtains<br/>\nan aggravating experience), and Celerity.   It is rumored that the level 49<br/>\nsong was to be Fufil&#39;s Curtaining Chant, but that Verant didn&#39;t feel bards<br/>\nshould be allowed to corner the market on Interior Decorating.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, attack the boxes.  Break the spawns carefully.  An uncontrolled<br/>\ntrain of boxes is a very, very scary thing.  And they have a remarkable way<br/>\nof blocking the exits.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all goes well with the boxes, you should be able to control the zone<br/>\nusing Lyssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto, Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion, and Verses<br/>\nof Celerity.  (Due to the need to frequently jump or climb over boxes, the<br/>\nagility buff of VoC makes it a better choice than the pure haste effect of<br/>\nCoC)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the boxes begin spawning uncontrollably, immediately stop your haste<br/>\nsong.  Twist instead Lyssa&#39;s Locating Lyric, Cataloging Libretto, and<br/>\nSolidarity of Vision.  (It is believed Lyssa did most of her composing<br/>\nwhile attacking boxes).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen all the boxes are dealt with, sing Cantana of Replenishment.  Your<br/>\nparty will appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe travels,<br/>\nEvulia, Jester of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
