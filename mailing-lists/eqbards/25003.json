I finally got my last crushed<br/>\ncoral yesterday and finished my Thurg quest. I then proceeded to complete<br/>\nthe extra little task to get the custom helm. I can not recall the name of<br/>\nthe NPC, but if you have a quest helm from a Kael helm drop you can do this<br/>\nalso. The NPC is located in a room to the left of Dain in Icewell Keep. Just<br/>\nask the 3 NPC in that room &quot;what helm?&quot; and he well tell you what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now that I have gone with the crazy looking Helm, tell me what you think<br/>\nof the look.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a picture of my new helm. Btw, I hope I don&#39;t get in trouble for<br/>\nposting a file, but I made it a pretty small in size.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t laugh too hard :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;1 Gnome Quest Helm.jpg&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all,<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
