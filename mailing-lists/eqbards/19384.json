Littering zones<br/>\nwith foraged items is now a BANNABLE offense!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly tells the guild, &quot;Did you see Gordon&#39;s latest post??? They have<br/>\ndiscovered that some players are killing NPC&#39;s purely for exp and getting<br/>\nlevels.  After the next patch, you will no longer get *any* exp from killing<br/>\nNPC&#39;s.  All exp will be earned through quests only.  They are gonna leave<br/>\ncetain loot items on NPC&#39;s to keep the economy going though.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. level 51 is bad, real bad, really really bad.  But now I am done and 52<br/>\nseems a bit better.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s.
