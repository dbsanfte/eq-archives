If it was after, then even more impressive.  After they made<br/>\nthe zone even tougher, i heard even groups of your caliber were slaughtered.<br/>\nAnd one other question...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bracers are No Drop did YOU get them???<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Actually the armour is much more gold looking than yellow and <br/>\n&gt; it looks very<br/>\n&gt; nice actually. We found a pair of golden arms from the vile <br/>\n&gt; plane off of a<br/>\n&gt; boogyman (yes thats right, a boogyman). They are bard only, <br/>\n&gt; had excellent<br/>\n&gt; ac, but gave int as their stat. As far as i always thought <br/>\n&gt; int sucks for a<br/>\n&gt; bard so the arms are not that great, besides the pretty gold <br/>\n&gt; sheen and the<br/>\n&gt; nice ac. I have heard all kinds of rumors about the plane, <br/>\n&gt; from you being<br/>\n&gt; instantly teleported the moment you set your foot in the door by Cazic<br/>\n&gt; Thule himself to a random location to other assorted garbage. <br/>\n&gt; Everytime i<br/>\n&gt; have set foot through that gate i have had no problem as long <br/>\n&gt; as i dont<br/>\n&gt; move. We had a very succesful fear expedition that involved <br/>\n&gt; 23 people, all<br/>\n&gt; lvl 40-50. We got more than a few stunningly cool pieces of <br/>\n&gt; equipment and<br/>\n&gt; had a very fun time with nobody dying. Thats not to say the plane isnt<br/>\n&gt; freaking rough, there are all manors of things hell bent on <br/>\n&gt; seperating you<br/>\n&gt; from your group. Tentacle Tormenters that will belt you 300 <br/>\n&gt; feet straight<br/>\n&gt; up (some people taking 700pts of dmg when they finally fell <br/>\n&gt; back down),<br/>\n&gt; Scarelings that will teleport you randomly away, and little <br/>\n&gt; bitty toadies<br/>\n&gt; that like to inflict fear upon you (a more deadly spell in <br/>\n&gt; that zone i dont<br/>\n&gt; think exists). We slaughtered a slew of strange beasties <br/>\n&gt; before we finally<br/>\n&gt; decided to call it a night and evac&#39;d out (yes there is a <br/>\n&gt; portal out, no<br/>\n&gt; you would most likely die trying to get to it).<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
