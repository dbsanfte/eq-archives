But this<br/>\n&gt; weekend i got an invite from a friend that was allready in <br/>\n&gt; hate so i figured<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;d gate up early....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Friday night: was allready empty zone practically (1-2 mobs <br/>\n&gt; on track) when i<br/>\n&gt; got there, my friend&#39;s guild was in maestro hall, we <br/>\n&gt; proceeded to pull the<br/>\n&gt; area, another bard logged in (that was in his guild) she got <br/>\n&gt; a helm and<br/>\n&gt; martune rapier.  I have no complaints though, my group was <br/>\n&gt; the xp group once<br/>\n&gt; i started chanting, made almost a full bub. Got tired <br/>\n&gt; afterwards, had to get<br/>\n&gt; some shut eye...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Saturday morning: join up with another guild up there, 2 <br/>\n&gt; other bards in<br/>\n&gt; zone, one of which had a full suit, other had bp/arms/gloves. <br/>\n&gt;  The one that<br/>\n&gt; needed pieces went LD just before we pull a banshee, never <br/>\n&gt; came back, i got<br/>\n&gt; boots.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sunday morning:  join up with yet another guild up there,  <br/>\n&gt; kill a couple<br/>\n&gt; mobs, 2 cr&#39;s later and 2 banshees, i got myself a bp woot!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All in all i guess im a lucky bard in hate so far, even won a <br/>\n&gt; lotto on a<br/>\n&gt; ruby crown (money money money).  Only thing i really care to <br/>\n&gt; get from the<br/>\n&gt; zone now is legs and lute and maybe a diamond if i&#39;m really <br/>\n&gt; lucky, and maybe<br/>\n&gt; a martune rapier would be nice in offhand.  I really cant <br/>\n&gt; complain, so far<br/>\n&gt; with this char my hate experience has been quite positive<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wonder what i&#39;ll get this week 8)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minkin<br/>\n&gt; lev 48 bard<br/>\n&gt; Ayonae Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In eqbards@y..., Rebecca Small &lt;rsmall@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Strangely enough, I&#39;ve spent only one full day in Hate. I was the <br/>\n&gt; only bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all day as I recall. I got the boots, BP and a Martune rapier. I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been back once for just a few hours, it was mostly clean and we <br/>\n&gt; just went to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lend a hand to the crew finishing up after some folks had to camp. <br/>\n&gt; No bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff dropped either time from the Maestro.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oh btw, I&#39;ve found wisps really really hate clerics. I haven&#39;t seen <br/>\n&gt; the like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; since they turned down bard hate. Twice last night in WC my L10 <br/>\n&gt; cleric was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ganged by wisps. I started on one, another dove in when the first <br/>\n&gt; was mostly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dead, then it was about dead a third and then a fourth jumped in! I <br/>\n&gt; only saw<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the one wisp when I started the fight. I had to run. Later, I <br/>\n&gt; started on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; another one and in about 2 minutes, I had five live wisps chase me <br/>\n&gt; to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zoneline after I killed the first one! Have you ever seen a wisp <br/>\n&gt; train? I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had zoned in and out between fights so there couldn&#39;t have been any <br/>\n&gt; leftover<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aggro.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Excalibur, Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
