My party was in Solesek&#39;s Eye and was about to leave, <br/>\nno one else was in the zone so I decided to see how big a train I could <br/>\nstart with this song.  By the time I left I had over a dozen gobs bouncing <br/>\noff me, fleeing in terror!  Then on my way out I came across 3 DE guards at <br/>\nthe zone to EC, so I feared them to, then shouted to the zone that their <br/>\n(the Dark Elves) guards were fleeing in terror from a lone bard, haha.    I <br/>\nlove being a Bard :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
