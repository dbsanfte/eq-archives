As it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-59127176\">I think you missed the point he was trying to make.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of EQ players, for whatever reason, are not high enough level yet to<br/>\ngo on a dragon raid.  As it stands right now on most servers, you have to be<br/>\n45+ to get invited on a dragon raid.  By the time you get to that level a<br/>\nfew months down the road, the expansion will likely be out.  Lets say in the<br/>\nexpansion Verant raises the level cap to 75.  So by the time us non 45+<br/>\npeople get to 45th level, the current level 50s will be fastly approaching<br/>\n75.  You have to assume that a lot of these 75 people will still go on<br/>\ndragon raids.  If it takes 24 level 45+ players now to kill a dragon, how<br/>\nmany level 75s will it take?  Once again you have to assume Verant will<br/>\nupgrade the dragons because out of X people on a dragon raid, Y people<br/>\nshould die.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think what Matt was implying is this is what he thinks will happen.  So<br/>\nwhat does that mean for us currently below 45th level? By the time we get to<br/>\n45th, people organizing raids will increase the minimum level to attend a<br/>\ndragon raid raid, i.e. new minimum level is 55th.  End result is now that we<br/>\nare 45th level, we&#39;re still to low to go on a dragon raid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the best way Verant can solve this problem for those of us currently<br/>\nnot high enough to go on a dragon raid (if they even consider it a problem),<br/>\nis that once the expansion comes out, put a maximum level limit to zone into<br/>\nPermafrost or Sol B.  Kind of like a reverse Plane level limit.  If they<br/>\nlimit entering those zones to level 50s and below , then they don&#39;t have to<br/>\nworry about level 75s coming in and easily killing a dragon.  They also<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to worry about continually making dragons tougher.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, be happy!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Seriously,  do what I do when you see posts that disturb you: delete them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right now, you have a lot of monsters to fight that are close to your<br/>\n&gt; level.<br/>\n&gt; Deal with them now.  Play the game &#39;one level at a time&#39; and enjoy.  There<br/>\n&gt; is nothing to be gained by worrying about stuff that is far away and<br/>\n&gt; unknown.  The dragon&#39;s you fight will be different from the ones that we<br/>\n&gt; fight today just as they are different from the first ones that were<br/>\n&gt; fought<br/>\n&gt; on all of the servers.  By the time you get there, there will be new<br/>\n&gt; weapons, new spells and a history of tips, tricks, and tales from those<br/>\n&gt; who<br/>\n&gt; have gone before.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Verant _knows_ that they are in the entertainment business.  My take is<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; they _will_ keep &quot;raising the bar&quot; on certain zones/monsters to prevent<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; from being &quot;farmed&quot; and provide challenge to the high levels.  Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; they may &quot;road block&quot; a zone or mob for one reason or another.  Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; they will make mistakes.  But any time there is a change in the status quo<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt; you will hear complaints.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of what you said was my point, Naggy is upgraded, Vox is upgraded,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Innoruk (he&#39;s the one with DT, right?) is upgraded.  They did this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because they were dying too easily.  This is all fine and good for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people who have been there before, and have plane/dragon equipment and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plane/dragon experience. (Actually its not, but at least you had a shot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at it)  By the time we get there, there will be no chance.  We will not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be lvl 50 before expansion, I cant imagine what Verant is going to do to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all those guys then...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
