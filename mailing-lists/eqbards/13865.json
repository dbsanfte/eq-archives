A druid or other<br/>\ntracker could just sit by while people wandered about killing stuff and when<br/>\nthe single named mob showed up race to it and have a fair chance of getting<br/>\nthere first as the people who cleared the way for it have moved on to other<br/>\nareas and are likely in a fight when the special spawns.  If there are<br/>\ntwelve different specials it would make it that much harder for the &quot;tracker<br/>\nin the shadows&quot; to just rush over and nab the special when it popped up as<br/>\nlikely several specials would be popping up at any given time if the place<br/>\nhas a fair amount of explorers in it.  Since the container guy doesn&#39;t move,<br/>\nbut is protected from camping by a respawning dead zone it wouldn&#39;t do much<br/>\ngood for anyone to go after him until they felt they had several of the<br/>\nitems.  Plus the container would take up 8 potential spots in their<br/>\ninventory if it held only small objects.  Make it weigh 20# and see who<br/>\nwould want to go grab it before they needed it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 27, 2000 2:03 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] My overcrowding solutuion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 27 Jan 2000, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not totally as it would force someone to hunt down 12 randomly placed<br/>\nnamed<br/>\n&gt; mobs to get a Ykesha quality item rather than just waiting around until<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; named mob spawned somewhere and then going after that.
