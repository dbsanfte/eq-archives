All I can<br/>\nsay is that pulling a single Gob from the lake is darn difficult (we were<br/>\ntrying just about everything we could think of).  The DW gobs are very tough<br/>\nas well.  One we could handle fairly easily.  Two was getting difficult.<br/>\nThree would be possible, but we&#39;d be severly damaged and/or low on mana,<br/>\netc.  Four is just plain out of the question.  As I stated though.. more<br/>\noften than not, you&#39;ll end up pulling a small army.  The lil&#39; buggers have<br/>\nsome nasty, nasty spells.  We were able to kill 2 or 3 during the evening<br/>\n(ran from a lot) and we never saw a helm.  I would speculate that the<br/>\nchances of them dropping it are roughly similar to lambent stones and<br/>\ngriffenne charms.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Robertson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, October 18, 1999 4:17 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Opaline Helm<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: John Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone here killed deepwater goblins to get this helm?  <br/>\n&gt; If so, could you give me an idea of<br/>\n&gt; the following:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -  What zone is best for this?
