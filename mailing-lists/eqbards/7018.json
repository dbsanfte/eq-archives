Who are these folks kidding? The only zone that is 4 zones away from a bind point is Nagafen&#39;s Lair. (Nag&#39;s Lair-&gt;Solusk A-&gt;Lavastorm-&gt;Nektulos-&gt;Neriak Foreign Quarter.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the other zones in the world are usually only 2, sometimes 3, zones away from a bind point. Is it just that folks aren&#39;t aware what the bind-able zones are? Or maybe good aligned characters don&#39;t realize they can be bound in evil cities just like good cities? Is a two zone run THAT bad? <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I&#39;m ignoring the fact that an item exists that allows ANY character to bind themselves ANYWHERE. Yes, it&#39;s hard to get, as it should be. But the option to get the item is available. And as long as this option is available for EVERY character, I don&#39;t think Verant will ever give binding ability to non-spellcasters through any new class-wide ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeledal<br/>\nBard of Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
