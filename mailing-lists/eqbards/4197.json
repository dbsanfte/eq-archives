You have good reasons too.  I really like the reminder <br/>\nabout people&#39;s happiness after winning a lottery!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewdeur, philosophizing Bard, Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Absolutely.  Every life (real or virtual) is different.  Some<br/>\n&gt;hit the dumps, some hit the jackpot.  I was merely warning the<br/>\n&gt;owner of the crown that if he took the gilded road, he may<br/>\n&gt;find that it didn&#39;t glitter quite as brightly as he&#39;d thought<br/>\n&gt;it would.  Whether he takes my advice is up to him - maybe he<br/>\n&gt;knows that the stuff I talked about doesn&#39;t matter to him, or<br/>\n&gt;maybe it does matter and hadn&#39;t thought about it and my<br/>\n&gt;advice saved him grief later on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I will admit my original reply probably sounded condescending<br/>\n&gt;towards powerlevelers (me being an explorer-type, if you speed<br/>\n&gt;through the game, you&#39;re not learning many of the nuances that<br/>\n&gt;give it depth).  But understand, I was only trying to make it<br/>\n&gt;clear to him that he should think carefully before choosing<br/>\n&gt;the &quot;easy&quot; route.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Most lottery winners in real life are not happier than before<br/>\n&gt;they won.  In fact, the happiest ones tend to be the ones who<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t change their lifestyle.  Sense of achievement,<br/>\n&gt;contribution, and self-worth are what matters to most.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
