The one<br/>\ntime monks get nerfed they get a two-page apology in the patch news the next<br/>\nday, we get nerfed nearly weekly and get squat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would urge every single bard, regardless of level to /bug the new Levitate<br/>\nresults and /Feedback them as well every single time you log on to play.<br/>\nMaybe several hundred /bugs and /feedbacks will get their F&%@in&#39; attention.<br/>\nIf not we should plan a Bard sit in like the monks had and see if a 50&#39;<br/>\ngnome shows up for that.  If he doesn&#39;t its just one more thing we can throw<br/>\nin their faces to prove that no one at Verant gives a Flotsam&#39;s A$$ about<br/>\nbards and we are sick of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t going to play tonite much do to having a hockey game, but I&#39;ll make<br/>\nsure to get on just to /bug the new levitate issue.

You have<br/>\n  to fall first, before the next pulse will reactivate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Otherwise, yes, you get the:  You are already floating   message.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The song no longer refreshed itself, wtf wasnt that change in the<br/>\n  patch message?  Because it&#39;s a nerf, that&#39;s why =)  This does not<br/>\n  impact casters whatsoever, it&#39;s aimed at bard&#39;s who can levitate<br/>\n  continously higher and higher.
