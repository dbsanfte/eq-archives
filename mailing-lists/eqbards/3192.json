I can&#39;t alt-tab to anything else without totally <br/>\nscrewing EQ and having to ctl-alt-del it to get it to <br/>\nclose down.  It really messes with my graphics.  Before I <br/>\nstart up EQ I close everything else down ... including my <br/>\nanti-virus software (hate having a scan during a melee <br/>\n... it&#39;s like fighting thru pudding!).<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on this thread, I&#39;m now wondering if it&#39;s just <br/>\nbecause my poor &#39;puter is just powerful enough to run EQ. <br/>\nIf that&#39;s the case, then woohoo! cuz I&#39;m waiting for my <br/>\nnew puter to be built.  How do you guys run the voice <br/>\ncommunication software while running EQ?
