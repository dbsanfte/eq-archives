Somethign very similar<br/>\n </span></blockquote>happened to me. I will tell you what I have learned.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was supposed to<br/>\nhappen?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t think it was supposed to happen, though I do know (not from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>experience however) that you can only cross the zone while you are on<br/>\nthe boat, and only the boat. The rowboats don&#39;t cut it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get stuck again<br/>\nif I<br/>\ntry to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to pull<br/>\nmy<br/>\ncorpse away from the zone border?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I died in the middle of the ocean of tears under similar<br/>\n </span></blockquote>circumstances. My video froze up, and when I started back, I was under<br/>\nwater. My mistake was trying to remomorize the Jig while at the surface<br/>\nof the water. Man, that was a big mistake. Anyway, when I found my<br/>\ncorpse, I was able to /corpse it to the surface and loot from there.<br/>\nTook me a few times because I was losing air while looting, but didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to come up from the bottom when I stopped. Of course, I happened<br/>\nto be in a relatively shallow part of the water.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)Will the locate corpse zone still point you in the<br/>\nright<br/>\ndirection even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you are<br/>\nlooking<br/>\nfor?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;In my experience, the song keeps playing, but the massage says<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sopmething along the lines of, &quot;you sense no corspes in this zone.&quot; <br/>\nSomething like that.<br/>\n  <br/>\n4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking on the<br/>\nbottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Can&#39;t answer this. Sorry<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to<br/>\n/petition.<br/>\nAssuming one is online the next time I play, will they automatically<br/>\nretrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?  I<br/>\nsure<br/>\nhope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to<br/>\nretrieve it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Good luck. Maybe having the GM follow you to see if there is a bug<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is a good idea. When I drowned, I petitioned as it was the fault of the<br/>\ngame locking up on me. (I have since theorized that it locked up due to<br/>\nmy video cards over heating, though that is still a guess). The GM told<br/>\nme that he would not help me because the servers never came down. He<br/>\nsaid it would be a grand adventure, and that I should have someone cast<br/>\nwater breathing on me to help me out. I was pretty mad about that, but<br/>\nseeing as how I ended up recovering my corpse, I ended up pretty happy<br/>\nabout it. I even ended up with a cool story to tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is all,<br/>\n<br/>\nMandibal<br/>\nTravelling bard from Qeynos<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
