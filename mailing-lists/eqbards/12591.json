I went to make a Lambent Bracer one day and headed up to ToSR<br/>\nwith 1100 gold, a lambent stone, the charm, and the bracelet. I went to<br/>\nGenni and bought the two Fire Opals. I then went to Ostorm, handed him the<br/>\ntwo Fire Opals and the Lambent stone, and hit trade. He basically said<br/>\n&#39;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&#39;, &#39;Here is your Lambent Fire Opal!&#39;,<br/>\n&#39;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&#39;. I found that rather odd. Since the<br/>\nordering of the speech indicated that just handing in the Fire Opals<br/>\nfinished the quest, I guessed that he had a Lambent Stone in his &#39;trade<br/>\nqueue&#39;. I ran and got 1100 more gold, bought two more Fire Opals, gave them<br/>\nto Ostorm (didn&#39;t trade him a Lambent Stone), and I got the Lambent Fire<br/>\nOpal.<br/>\n\tIt was originally thought that the NPC would remember the list of things<br/>\nthat *you* gave him/her independent of everyone else. Turns out that there<br/>\nis only one list. This means, of course that your level 50 buddy could give<br/>\nWilliam the Gypsy Lute and the Basalt Carapace, then you give him the<br/>\nlambent Ruby, and you would get the Lambent BP with all the experience too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Robin Wise 3 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eurmali@...\">eurmali@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 05, 2000 4:12 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Lambent breastplate quest peculiarity<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a funny little screwup I learned as a lad in Kelethin doing the<br/>\nspider silk quest over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time you hand an item to the NPC, the NPC checks their inventory and<br/>\ncompares it with the list of things required to complete the quest.  If<br/>\nthere are fewer items in inventory than required to complete the quest, you<br/>\nget the &quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&quot; line.  When all the quest items<br/>\nare in the NPCs inventory, the quest is completed and the inventory is<br/>\ndeleted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI discovered this quite by accident when I gave Sylia Windlehands 3<br/>\nspidersilks instead of the 4 she wanted and completed the quest.  Every<br/>\nsubsequent time I did it I would bring 4 or more silks and give them to her<br/>\none at a time - and quite frequently it took fewer than 4 to complete the<br/>\nquest.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy theory, then, is that someone somehow handed in a single quest item,<br/>\nperhaps thinking the lambent quests should be done in stages.  You handed in<br/>\nthe other three, triggering the quest completion (receiving your<br/>\nbreastplate, congrats!!!), and also gave one &quot;extra&quot; component, thus<br/>\ntriggering the &quot;extra&quot; error message.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard that some quests require all the items to be given at the same<br/>\ntime, though I don&#39;t test to see which - most quests I do these days cost a<br/>\nfair amount of time and/or money, and I don&#39;t want to repeat them if I<br/>\nhappen to guess wrong.  So although I have tested this trick with spider<br/>\nsilk (and once, by accident, with honey jum) I can&#39;t guarantee it works with<br/>\nall quests.
