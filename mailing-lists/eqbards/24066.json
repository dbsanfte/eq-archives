Suddenly, I see a dot on me.  Ok, no<br/>\nproblem.  This happened near the big statue at the waterfall just outside<br/>\nthe outpost, so I ran just a little ways back towards the outpost, figure<br/>\nI&#39;m near enough the pilgrims and butterfly things (heh...forget name), and I<br/>\nstart hymn.   Look at health bar.  Equip lute.  Look at health bar.  Panic.<br/>\nSit.  Watch health bar dwindle to nothing.  Die.  Was funny, in it&#39;s own<br/>\nlittle way.  I was sitting, talking in guildchat about this particular necro<br/>\n(not very flattering), necros in general, and dots, and wondering if a 29<br/>\nbard can live through a 50-odd level necro dot....right up until I died.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve become very aware of my surroundings now when travelling from FV to<br/>\nLOIO.  :P<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 27, 2001 12:37 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Bards and Pulling (and a few other comments)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and there&#39;s no way for the casters to nail you down unless you let <br/>\n </span></blockquote>them.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you&#39;re one of the .28% of EQ players who plays a Bard on PVP <br/>\nand your group member roots ya. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
