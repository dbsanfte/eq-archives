I gave him a tell and was offered 100pp to take him from Qeynos to Rivervale to be twinked there by his level 50 char :).  Of course I accepted the offer and we ran down to Rivervale, in the end he died once and had to take the boat back across the Ocean from Erudin but eventually we got there safely and I was 100pp richer.<br/>\nToday, as a further reward for my services the player logged on as his level 50 cleric and asked me to meet him at the Freeport Bank.  When I arrived he gave me the following for my help previously: A pair of Bronze Bracers, Elf Hide Gloves, Crested Spaulders.  I promptly thanked him and he left saying thanks.  As he was leaving a level 50 warrior in the bank was selling a Jagged Band for 50pp, so I telled him and purchased my new peice of jewelery immediately.  I then sold my old Amber ring, the 2 bronze bracers (too heavy for their ac), and my old Rusty Spiked shoulders to a Bard friend of mine for 40pp.  After that I met the Cleric again and he needed help buying spells for his Enchanter at the Caster Guild because everyone was dubious to him.  I helped him there and once again thanked him for his earlier gifts.  So now, I am wondering   if The Crested Spaulders ac:11 +6sta are good for me to use, or maybe I can trade it for things like A pair of Golden Amber earrings, a Second Jagged band, Bloodstained Mantle, A runed Bone Fork etc.  I am happy with my current Dual Weilding of a Barbed Leather whip and Dragoon dirk, so I think that Armor is the way to go.<br/>\nAny help in this subject would be wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nGleeman, bard of the 18th song - Karana<br/>\nThe luckiest Bard in Norrath.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
