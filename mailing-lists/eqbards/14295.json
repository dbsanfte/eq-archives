It&#39;s not someone I want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cluttering my inbox. Here&#39;s an example for you. If you go to a fine<br/>\n&gt; &gt; restaurant, then order food, but dislike it intensely, complain to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chef of it&#39;s quality, then demand your money back, do you go back there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the next night for dinner, hoping the chef has miraculously changed his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cooking style to suit you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just one point to make here. I&#39;ve been following this list since June or<br/>\n&gt; so, and most of what I&#39;ve read from Kim and Ryan has been useful<br/>\n&gt; discussion, analysis, and tips on how to play the bard. In fact, they<br/>\n&gt; are probably 2 of the more prolific posters to the list and I usually<br/>\n&gt; find the threads they post in to be very interesting. However, the only<br/>\n&gt; posts I can recall reading from the recent complainers about their<br/>\n&gt; latest postings are, the complaints.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In other words, if your only contribution to the list is to complain<br/>\n&gt; when a couple of prolific posters deviate from what you want to hear,<br/>\n&gt; are you really contributing? Is this list just here for your<br/>\n&gt; entertainment in read only mode or is it here for everyone to share all<br/>\n&gt; aspects of the bard class in this game, the good and the bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Finding a sweetheart is hard work.
