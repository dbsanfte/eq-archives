There are some inconsistencies with that, however, such as #14 that you<br/>\n&gt;mention.  There are drawings in Sol A that you might want to factor into<br/>\n&gt;this discussion as well.  At least one of those in Sol A (Gabbie&#39;s room I<br/>\n&gt;think) has a map that seems to depict a coordinated attack on Lord Nagefen<br/>\n&gt;by the Goblins.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you look at #8, I always thought that that picture depicted a failed<br/>\n&gt;Nagefen attempt by the Golins.  You have Goblins charging Naggy with weapons<br/>\n&gt;in hand, and a slew of dead Goblins around him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When I look at #13 from the King Room, I always thought that this depicted<br/>\n&gt;the defeat of a former King at the hands of the Goblins, perhaps prior to<br/>\n&gt;the Nagefen raid from #8?
