Every class goes through weak period and overall a level 50 bard is<br/>\nextremly powerful and a great group member. I also play a level 50 necro and<br/>\nI guaruntee you every class has it weak points. I almost quit my necro at<br/>\nlevel 34 because they go through a extremly weak period at 30-43. Onec they<br/>\nhit 44 they get pretty good and by 49 they become the most powerful solo<br/>\nclass in the game which is what was promised for the necro class. Bards on<br/>\nthe otherhand are not supposed to be great at any one thing they are the<br/>\njack of all trades and in the end they can do a bit of everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Donny Dane &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddane@...\">ddane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, December 03, 1999 11:09 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard sit in or Mana Song walkout or whatever (long,<br/>\npossibly rant ish)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Donny Dane&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddane@...\">ddane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;See Comments Below:<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: SteelWolf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwolf@...\">steelwolf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Friday, December 03, 1999 7:23 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Bard sit in or Mana Song walkout or whatever (long,<br/>\n&gt;possibly rant ish)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: SteelWolf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwolf@...\">steelwolf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I find this uninformed. We are perhaps the most versatile class in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; game. People that can find nothing but faults in their class make me<br/>\n&gt;&gt; think one thought - you are playing the wrong class. We have so many<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ways at our disposal to do almost anything, it&#39;s truely terrifying.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Dodge is capped at 125 for a reason - a bard is not a tank. This is also<br/>\n&gt;&gt; why we don&#39;t get bash, parry, or double attack. When dodge caps at L24<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you already should have begun occupying roles in your party other than<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tank. Just look at how a bard solo&#39;s in the 40+ range to see how true<br/>\n&gt;&gt; this is. Do you tank a blue or higher monster to kill it? of course not.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You use charm or chains and fear as two possible options.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Of course, even if you are not the tank, songs move you up on the agro list<br/>\n&gt;*every* time they pulse.<br/>\n&gt;So, not a tank, just a punching bag.  With no way of defending ourselves.<br/>\n&gt;BTW, I&#39;m only 20th, but i&#39;ve observed this quite a bit.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If you aren&#39;t able to effective employ Lullaby, or it seems ineffectual,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ask constructively how others use it in this forum. Personally when I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; solo, if there is any chance I&#39;ll fight a caster, Lullaby is memm&#39;d. It<br/>\n&gt;&gt; may very well be mem&#39;d while I am grouped as well. There is nothing like<br/>\n&gt;&gt; repeatedly interrupting a jin frogluk shaman attempting to cast heal to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; make your group immediately value your presence.<br/>\n&gt;umm...how about :<br/>\n&gt;mob nods, mob smacks the crap out of you.<br/>\n&gt;mob nods, mob stuns you.<br/>\n&gt;start lullaby<br/>\n&gt;mob nods, mob smacks the crap out of you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While fighting, solo, either melee or caster, in the Karanas and Lake Rathe<br/>\n&gt;area, at level 19th, and 20th, I NEVER saw a mob interrupted in the least<br/>\n </span></blockquote>by<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;this song.

Many of our songs at the level we get them are very weak, but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; unlike most classes, whose spells have damage caps, our songs continue<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to increase in power without limit. A L50 Bard is truely one of the most<br/>\n&gt;&gt; formidable and broad-spectrumed options to play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wouldn&#39;t know - been playing since day two of release, and am still only<br/>\n&gt;20th level.
