This<br/>\nsong has great longterm benefits in the fact that you&#39;ll get better prices<br/>\nfrom NPC vendors when buying and selling.  It also allows you to start /<br/>\nfinish quests that would normally require a lot grunt work to get to the<br/>\nappropriate faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 28 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lange, Stephen [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SLANGE@...\">SLANGE@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, October 04, 1999 2:09 PM<br/>\nTo: Eqbards (E-mail)<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Level 11 Spell - Cinda Charismatic Carrillion (sp)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lange, Stephen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SLANGE@...\">SLANGE@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayed with my new Level 11 spell today.  Its a nice faction modifier, have<br/>\nseen mysefl go from inddiferent to amiable and from apprehensive to<br/>\nindifferent.
