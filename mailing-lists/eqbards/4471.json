I did in the arena with<br/>\na warrior friend and it was resisted so often as to be useless. At the<br/>\ntime I was L47 with charisma of 113 and he was a L45 warrior with a<br/>\nmagic resist of 10 or 15. (whatever the base troll warrior magic resist<br/>\nis) He even took off his resist boosting items to help see if it made a<br/>\ndifference) We also found that jboots break chaining. Sung fear was<br/>\nresisted close to 80% of the time, while with a horn it was resisted<br/>\nlike 50%. But if you use a horn, what are you going to hit them with?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found for PvP, all our songs are resisted heavily by PC chars, even<br/>\nones 4 levels below us, far more often than they are by mobs. If I was<br/>\ngoing to play on a PvP+ server, I think I&#39;d play a naked mage, just like<br/>\neveryone else. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
