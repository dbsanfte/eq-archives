And","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1587276783\">Short answer - yes, you get xp - no problem. Longer answer - keep reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got over a bub - call it a bub and and 3/16ths xp - for the night - 4<br/>\nhours. And we lost about half our kills to a killstealer wizard but that&#39;s<br/>\nanother story.  It was as good as the XP rates killing chickens.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt low levels - a 4 level difference has a greater effect than at higher<br/>\nlevels.  There are caps in place to prevent simple xp twinking.  And the<br/>\nlevel differences are one of them. The ability to damage and to get xp from<br/>\nmobs is another. But first examine the distributions of allowed xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nLow level:<br/>\n<br/>\n4 warrior<br/>\n5 pallie<br/>\n9 wizzie<br/>\n---------<br/>\n18 total <br/>\n<br/>\nThey go off and burn down a gnoll guard that awards them with 100 xp points<br/>\n<br/>\nwarrior gets 4/18th<br/>\npallies gets 5/18th<br/>\nwizzie gets 9/18 - or half the xp (and talks them into trying a badder mob<br/>\nnext time)<br/>\n<br/>\nso here the warrior really gets robbed<br/>\n<br/>\nNow at the 20&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n21 bard<br/>\n25 cleric<br/>\n26 warrior<br/>\n28 wizzie<br/>\n--- <br/>\n100 total<br/>\n<br/>\nbard gets 21/100&#39;s<br/>\ncleric gets 25/100&#39;s<br/>\nwarrior gets 26/100&#39;s<br/>\nwizzie gets 28/100&#39;s (and makes an excuse to leave the group so he can go<br/>\nsolo)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the low guy gets 20% where the others get 25% or so.  The difference<br/>\nbetween 1/5th and 1/4th is much better than 1/4th and 1/2th.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow add in the safety factor.  I didn&#39;t die and suffer the xp loss.  I&#39;d<br/>\nrather be in a group with higher levels who know what they are doing than be<br/>\nthe high level in a group that is trying new things.  This is when I am<br/>\ngoing purely for xp.  But I still can&#39;t resist the green bandit camps and<br/>\none day I shall triumph!  I don&#39;t care if there are 10 of them - I just made<br/>\nmy level and I am powerfull! LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously - things change over 20 - I am comfortable with eeven a level diff<br/>\nof 8.  Over 25, it could go to 10 easy, in 30&#39;s and up 15 and more prolly<br/>\nwont matter.  Try some numbers and see.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem with being low in a group with highers is the mobs they can hurt<br/>\n- you prolly can&#39;t hurt. As a bard, you can make them better at what they do<br/>\nso they can be more effective - but you wont do direct damage on the deep<br/>\nreds they attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in a group last night at the chicken ranch.  We filled up and<br/>\nimmediately they started in: &#39;we got 6 now - lets do an avocet!&quot;  Well duh,<br/>\nmaybe 4 of the 6 can hurt an avo but 2 of us can&#39;t.  It don&#39;t matter if you<br/>\nget 20 more of us - hitting an avo for 1 dmg per round is gonna be death.<br/>\nAnd there is a level cap between you and the dead mob.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSay you group with a couple mid to high 20&#39;s and you are 20.  So they are<br/>\nstrong casters, got SoW and they ping-pong a cylops. You get no xp because<br/>\nthe mob is too high for you. Not because of the level differences between<br/>\nyou and your party.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there are all different aspects of level diffs and xp to look at.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 20th level<br/>\na.k.a.

I remember when I was level 5<br/>\nand my friend was<br/>\n\t\tlevel 9 and trying to help me out, I stopped getting<br/>\nexperience when we were<br/>\n\t\tgrouped because he was 4 levels above me. I&#39;ve heard that<br/>\neven when the<br/>\n\t\tlevels are closer, the people with the higher levels get<br/>\nmore experience<br/>\n\t\tthan the lower levels regardless of who does the most<br/>\ndamage. Of course if<br/>\n\t\tyou were just there for the fun, it wouldn&#39;t matter - but I<br/>\nwas just curious<br/>\n\t\tif you got any experience from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tCongratulations to Richard van den Brink<br/>\n\t\tThis week&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY WINNER! <br/>\n\t\tTo enter go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
