I was fighting Hornets near the Hornet&#39;s nest in Burning Wood.  A<br/>\ncouple party members left - so we were down to three when about 4 hornets<br/>\naggro on us.  I was using Sow since we did a lot of kiting - and of course<br/>\nit runs out.  I decide it&#39;s time &quot;for the better part of valor&quot; and start to<br/>\nrun to zone.  By then health getting really low and running real slow even<br/>\nwith Selo&#39;s - because I had weapons equipped.  So I start to switch weaps to<br/>\nMM Drum - and I drop it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy friends tried to find the drum - but to no avail.  Keep in mind the the<br/>\nground is very brown in that section of the zone.  After I ran to the zone<br/>\nwith a hand drum and dropped it on the ground to test - you basically had to<br/>\nknow exactly where to look at find it.  Whatever genius decided to a drum a<br/>\nsingle stick on the ground should be pistol-whipped.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThinking about all our talk &quot;confirm switches&quot; and such - it seems  to me<br/>\nthat could solve the problem by simply not treating a click as a drop in the<br/>\narea near the hotkeys...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnyway - it sure is frustrating to to lose an item that goes for between<br/>\n750-1000p (on Xegony at least the last time I checked) due to a poor<br/>\ninterface and graphic design...  At least camping a new one; shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nvery difficult with myself and guildmates in our 40&#39;s...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\nXegony Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
