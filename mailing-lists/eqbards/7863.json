Well... in moderation anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am but a bellowing bard (12th song) who still marvels at the wonders of<br/>\nNorrath upon entering a zone for the first time. (Last night was Oasis and S<br/>\nRo.). I have never asked anyone for anything and prefer the satisfaction<br/>\nthat comes from watching the pp&#39;s inch slowly upward in the bank as I return<br/>\nfrom a glorious hunt. Grouping is a joy, and the social interaction of the<br/>\nBard is unmatched among classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn one fateful night, my 9th song, fully leathered, non-twinked mino axe<br/>\nwielding self answered a tell in the bank for a Bracer of Erollisi (sp?). I<br/>\nhad 7pp to my name (saved for my next song) but wanted the item and talked<br/>\nthe seller down to 5pp. We completed the transaction and I was ready to<br/>\ndepart when the seller asked if I would do him a favor. It turns out he was<br/>\na high (to me) level druid and wanted to trade some equipment with another<br/>\ncharacter of his. I agreed, not considering cross-character transfers to be<br/>\ntwinking. Several items passed through my inventory, and I caught a glimpse<br/>\nof wonders I knew I would not see for many many game years. I was happy to<br/>\nhelp and he was happy to reward me for my time (about a half hour investment<br/>\nfor which I expected nothing). He gave me a bronze BP, helm, boots, and<br/>\nmisc. other items (no cash). I confess that I felt a twinge of indecision,<br/>\nthen happily accepted the items. Since then I have had no regrets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not ask for anything, nor do I expect anything when I help people. But<br/>\nI am grateful for the generosity I have experienced and will happily pass on<br/>\nmy items to another when the time comes. The game has been rewarding for me<br/>\nas much for the random acts of kindness as anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\nMeandering Maestro<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 12:55 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In theory, I agree with you.  Tell me about your wonderful adventure<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; a Polish Garnet Tommychopper. Why do I think the story would go something<br/>\n&gt; like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;We spent four cold rainy Norrath days and nights in the Highhold Pass.<br/>\n&gt; Many foul gnolls fell to our blades.  We dealt with shamans, brawlers and<br/>\n&gt; champions.  Some fights were so close we praised the gods that we<br/>\nsurvived!<br/>\n&gt; And then thru the mist, he appeared - the head muckity-muck of the<br/>\nMuckTail<br/>\n&gt; Clan - Granix Mucktail himself!  We took a deep breath, we drew our<br/>\nswords,<br/>\n&gt; we said our prayers and then.........<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cecille begins to cast a spell...<br/>\n&gt; Toronto begins to cast a spell...<br/>\n&gt; Talishar begins to cast a spell...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And when the particles cleared the air...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cecille auctions PGT bids start at 250pp!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (For those of you who don&#39;t play on Innoruuk server, the names have NOT<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; changed to protect the guilty Ks&#39;ers.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It would be an entirely different game if......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. There was no camping/farming (lots of good ways to fix this - don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really matter how)<br/>\n&gt; 2. There were no Kill Stealing (again good ways to fix and perhaps we<br/>\n&gt; are actually gonna see some implemented.)<br/>\n&gt; 3. There was no internet (ie: spolier sites and instant flow of<br/>\n&gt; information)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Ok, so this is Guk - where do we go from here?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Who&#39;s got the maps?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Lemme log quick and grab one&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Nm, I&#39;ll print one off me laptop - one sec&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But that&#39;s not the way it is so we end up with a player driven economy.<br/>\nMy<br/>\n&gt; group has lots of money and we buy the stuff we want/need and simply avoid<br/>\n&gt; the ks&#39;ing campers.  We did have one really lucky night in the Tae room in<br/>\n&gt; Cazic and got some rubi panties.  The next night was KS-Hell and we have<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; been back.  Stoopid Kyle, does he really think that we don&#39;t have see<br/>\ninvis?<br/>\n&gt; So the moron sits by the throne.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right now - its damn near impossible to get the stuff you want the old<br/>\n&gt; fashion way so you end up buying it and hunting other places for xp.<br/>\nLet&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; see some gators drop some rubi - mebbe they ate some one who was wearing<br/>\n&gt; some!  I know they ate me and my steel plate!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also have great armor is only marginally better that having &quot;average&quot;<br/>\n&gt; armors.  It looks a whole lot better!  But the real &quot;twink&quot; for power is<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; stat jewelry, stat items, and uber-weapons.  Those things will make a<br/>\ndecent<br/>\n&gt; difference in your performance.  Armor is just the most visible twink.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night, our group spent 4 hours in Unrest and we got virtually a full<br/>\n&gt; set of small bronze - pretty good night.  So, what is the &quot;right&quot; thing to<br/>\n&gt; do with it?  Sell it to the local young warriors and endure another 2<br/>\nhours<br/>\n&gt; of hard luck tales and haggling over 2pp here and 4pp there?  Or would it<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; ok with you if I started a gnome warrior and gave it to him when his<br/>\ncorpse<br/>\n&gt; stopped decaying in 15 minutes?  Or would it be ok with you if I just gave<br/>\n&gt; it to the next cute little wood elf who might look even cuter in all<br/>\nbronze<br/>\n&gt; while I am waiting for the wiz to break camp and port us back to<br/>\n&gt; civilization?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Put a little magic happiness in some ones life - twink them!~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 30th song<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 10:38 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My Bard, has never ever been given a single item or money!<br/>\n&gt; Not that I do<br/>\n&gt; not have friends who offer.
