If they didn&#39;t have the items no drop, they&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; probably cut the<br/>\n&gt; spawn of items even more to assure that everyone didn&#39;t have one.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I also think they implemented the &quot;NO DROP&quot; flag to minimize the amount of<br/>\n&quot;farming&quot; & &quot;harvesting&quot; of items.  Without it, you know that there would be<br/>\npeople camping quest item spawns and then attempting to sell the items.  &quot;NO<br/>\nDROP&quot; isn&#39;t the perfect solution, but I consider it to be the lesser of two<br/>\nevils.  In fact, from what I understand of the game mechanics I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthey could come up with an ideal solution without a major overhaul of the<br/>\nentire system.  Also, in a FRPG milieu, it makes perfect sense to keep<br/>\ncertain items rare and unique - unfortunately, most people consider it their<br/>\nbirthright to eventually own these particular items simply because they<br/>\nexist - and they&#39;ll go to great lengths to obtain them.  If every rare item<br/>\nwas dropped all the time, it would just be a matter of time before everyone<br/>\nin the game had the best equipment (for their class) with little regard for<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
