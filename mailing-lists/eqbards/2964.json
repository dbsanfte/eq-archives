I was<br/>\n&gt;lucky enuf to acquire a pair of elf-hide gloves (thank you Lamont :)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on fennin ro, the gloves typically go for 100pp, and the belts probably a<br/>\nbit more, since they seem a little more rare than the gloves. of course,<br/>\nthe economy on fennin ro is completely out of wack now.<br/>\n<br/>\nklamot - bard of fennin ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
