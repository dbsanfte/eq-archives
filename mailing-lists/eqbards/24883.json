Why?  Because I wasn&#39;t happy with my <br/>\nchoice of religions.  In order to be able to visit anywhere, I decided that <br/>\nI&#39;d better work without any religion at all.  Now for the fun part - <br/>\nregaining my levels, *without* being powerlevelled.  It&#39;s amazing how a <br/>\nwell-played bard can seem like he&#39;s being power-levelled anyway ;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 26 hours of play, I regained all 11 levels, and improved my faction <br/>\nenough to be indifferent in Ak&#39;Anon (got to work on that just a wee bit <br/>\nmore), and in Rivervale to Amiable, probably half-way to warmly.  Still got <br/>\na long way to go to get the squad ring ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is - just how effective is the Carillon in situations like this?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you interested, I started in Kelethin, had a friend hand me my <br/>\neq back (full-banded armour, plus a lumberjack&#39;s cap, no jewelry, a combine <br/>\nlong sword, Rukgus&#39;s sticker, and a Shiny Brass Shield that Talies had <br/>\nfought for to begin with.  I didn&#39;t want to be &quot;twinked&quot; - I worked for (or <br/>\npayed hard-earned cash for) everything I have.  No freebies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI stayed in the Kelethin newbie area for a while, collecting wolf pelts and <br/>\nspider silk to work on tailoring, and bone chips to sell to needy <br/>\nnecros.  Only died once until level 4, when I went cliff-jumping with a <br/>\ncrazy druid - just to see what would happen (I died ;).  At level 5, I gave <br/>\nup on orc-hunting - either I&#39;d get jumped, and no one would help, or I&#39;d <br/>\nhave a nice yellow all alone, and someone would steal it.  I headed for the <br/>\n(relative) peace of Steamfont.  Stayed there until 8th, when I headed <br/>\nacross the ocean to Misty Thicket (got bound in Rivervale, after 30 minutes <br/>\nof asking...)  Hunted Goblins almost exclusively until 10th, when I started <br/>\nmixing in other stuff for experience (and because there were a lot of <br/>\nfaction hunters out there significantly cutting down on the numbers of <br/>\ngoblins.)  BTW - Did you know that the Goblin Alchemist REALLY HURTS at <br/>\nlevel 10?  *ouch*.  Fortunately, a 49th level Necro killed <br/>\nhim.  Unfortunately, for any monks out there, a 9th level Cleric decided to <br/>\ntake the ribcage and wear it.  *sighs* Some people&#39;s children...<br/>\nIn the process of gaining 11 levels, I&#39;ve kept all of my combat skills and <br/>\nmusic skills maxed, and worked a little on baking, tailoring and <br/>\nsmithing.  All told, I&#39;ve made over 125 pp of pure in-the-bank profit (not <br/>\nincluding purchases).  Not a bad haul for one weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n11th and counting</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
