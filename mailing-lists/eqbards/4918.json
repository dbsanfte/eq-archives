This enabled us to clear almost everything in the zone <br/>\n&gt; except for<br/>\n&gt; Cazic himself and his three henchmen fright, terror, and dread. We had<br/>\n&gt; killed all of his henchmen before and they hadnt dropped anything<br/>\n&gt; interesting so we where thinking we would just rather ignore <br/>\n&gt; them. At this<br/>\n&gt; point we started getting cocky. Dracoliche was cake for us <br/>\n&gt; and if another<br/>\n&gt; server could kill cazic, well then we could to. So we <br/>\n&gt; launched our assault<br/>\n&gt; and imediatly cazic said something about his henchmen better <br/>\n&gt; come over and<br/>\n&gt; help him. At this point various profanties where uttered as <br/>\n&gt; we realized our<br/>\n&gt; fatal mistake, and sure enough fright, terror, and dread <br/>\n&gt; showed up on the<br/>\n&gt; spot just as we had cazic at half life. Luckily for us we had <br/>\n&gt; several high<br/>\n&gt; level magicancs and necros which set their pets on the <br/>\n&gt; henchmen. With this<br/>\n&gt; borrowed time we finished cazic and gated out with minimal <br/>\n&gt; losses. Killing<br/>\n&gt; him was about the same as the dracoliche except the three henchman.<br/>\n&gt; Definatly need to take out the henchmen first before killing cazic :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Updated bestiary: <br/>\n&gt; Phoboplasms are my new personal favorite, they can drop up to <br/>\n&gt; TWO random<br/>\n&gt; class specific items. Last night we killed around 8 of these <br/>\n&gt; guys and TWO<br/>\n&gt; dropped a bard bracer, along with a bunch of ranger and shaman stuff. <br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule : 8 platinum. Thats it. Good thing killing him <br/>\n&gt; was so much fun<br/>\n&gt; cause that was a big let down. <br/>\n&gt; Nightmare&#39;s drop some silly piece of nightmare hide that can cancel<br/>\n&gt; blindness. Woopydo. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Total bard pieces found have been 2 bracers, helmet, and <br/>\n&gt; boots (which i<br/>\n&gt; got) and arms and gloves which another bard got. No greaves <br/>\n&gt; or breastplates<br/>\n&gt; yet :(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
