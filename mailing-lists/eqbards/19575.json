If so I may be amiable now in Cabilis.  Here<br/>\nis what happened.  I was fighting in the Overthere when my group pulled 3<br/>\nsarnaks.  We snared one and I fired up screech.  The 2d and 3d sarnak<br/>\nweren&#39;t snared so they ran so far away that when the fear wore off they<br/>\nnever came back.  I was pulling but didn&#39;t see the two sarnaks anywhere<br/>\nnearby.  I assume they continued to wand around the zone.  Next few pulls<br/>\nwere nothing but rhinos, tigers, and cockatrices.  Then I started to get the<br/>\n&quot;ghost&quot; faction messages for the sarnaks(plus Cabilis/minus sarnaks).  I&#39;m<br/>\nassuming that the two sarnaks I feared passed by other sarnaks and added me<br/>\nto their hate list.  So when other people killed them I got the faction<br/>\nmessage.  A side benefit to this is that from that point on it was very easy<br/>\nfor me to pull sarnaks.  Normally to pull them I have to get withing FCC<br/>\nrange.  But since I was on the hate list for almost every sarnak in the zone<br/>\nall I had to do was get one within sight and it would aggro on me<br/>\nautomatically.  To top it off on some occasions the sarnak I pulled would<br/>\nbring a friend with him that wasn&#39;t even in sight.  I ended up getting<br/>\nnumerous ghost faction messages all night long.  I haven&#39;t been to Cabilis<br/>\nyet but with all the ghost faction I&#39;ve gotten while in the Overthere it<br/>\nmight be possible that I can roam freely in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Big Daddy Legba [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 09, 2000 6:07 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Treasure changes in Frontier Mountains<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell thats lovely...  I hope having ultra negative faction won&#39;t hurt me...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned to ignore faction messages in kunark as I get them<br/>\nconstantly.  (But its not a bug according to the Veeshan Guides).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case its still pretty darn annoying as I usually pull (most people<br/>\ndon&#39;t pull fast enough for my taste).  Especially against things that run<br/>\nfast, like the giants...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
