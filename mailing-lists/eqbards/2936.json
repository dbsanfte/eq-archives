Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>\n&gt; with lots of spells flying?

This<br/>\nis with a Celeron 450 128MB Ram and a Voodoo2 8MB.  Not exactly the<br/>\ngreatest setup.  Though I cannot be one hundred percent sure at times<br/>\nbecause my cable modem connection is really bad.  I usually get spikes of<br/>\n70%-80% packet loss at times. Last night I was able to do it in Guk while<br/>\nadventuring with 2 wizards and a Druid and everything seemed responsive<br/>\nenough for me to twist the standard bello, bellow, anthem combo.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Bard of Kelethin<br/>\nAariel Mage of Felwithe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
