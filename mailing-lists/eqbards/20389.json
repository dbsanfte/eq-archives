I didn&#39;t need to Haste, Slow, Snare (2 <br/>\ndruids), Heal (2 clerics, 2 druids, 1 shaman)... I could have sang <br/>\nbattle buffs to buff some str and dex and such, but there was only 1 <br/>\ntank (Warrior) in my party... not a whole lot of mileage gained.  So, <br/>\nI chanted (with selo&#39;s drum) and I charmed (a little) and I played <br/>\nmana song and bind sight to help scout in the downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas I being the most effective Bard I could be... imho, Yes.  And was <br/>\nthat helpful to the group?  Hell, yes.  Don&#39;t forget the magic, fire, <br/>\nand cold resistances you&#39;re also lowering on top of the damage you&#39;re <br/>\ndoing.  That&#39;s helping every one of your nukers, procing weapons, <br/>\noverzealous druids with their newfound starburst, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a different tangent.. I hate telling people how to play their <br/>\nclass, but I&#39;m getting pretty annoyed at hearing the druid in the <br/>\nparty &quot;/g OOM&quot; before the wizard or mage does.  And this is WITH a <br/>\nvery good cleric in the party, so they&#39;re not blowing it on <br/>\nheals. :)  Won&#39;t be grouping with that druid again... too bad he <br/>\nwalked off with 2 spell scrolls and a Sarnak Shield. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\n50.8 Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess we need to agree to disagree here &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My number one system is 3 chants off the naggy drum.
