First night the zone crashed just as we<br/>\nwere cleared to the Maestro. Absolutely no bard stuff dropped. I think<br/>\nWarrior legs dropped the first night, then no more all weekend. No Mage<br/>\nstuff dropped, a few shaman pieces. In general, other than cleric stuff,<br/>\nthe drop rate is just pitiful and has a few people who&#39;ve been going for<br/>\nseveral months contemplating quitting as there&#39;s just not much point to<br/>\nplaying anymore. Playing for fun isn&#39;t once you&#39;ve done Hate a few<br/>\ntimes, as IMO, it&#39;s one of the most boring zones they&#39;ve created. The<br/>\nfast spawning roamers keep you camped in the same locations for hours<br/>\nand even if you did move around every place looks pretty well like every<br/>\nother place.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo top it off, a 6 note blade dropped and all the bards had one, and<br/>\nInno dropped a fatty shaman hammer and there were no fatty shaman on the<br/>\ntrip.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to add to the buggy RNG theory, I foraged 100 vegetables over the<br/>\nweekend compared to 20-40 of fruit, berries and rabbit meat. What are<br/>\nthe odds of that happening? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
