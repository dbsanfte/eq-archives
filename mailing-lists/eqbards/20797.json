The Voodoo3 was fine except some spell effects would lag me down,<br/>\nmost notably the AOE rain type spells.  So I upgraded.  The visual quality<br/>\non the GeForce2 isn&#39;t quite as good; the ground ahead gets kind of grainy<br/>\nand/or swimmy and in general things in the distance don&#39;t look as good, but<br/>\nI don&#39;t get graphical lag at all any more.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can fix the swimmy textures up in a second by switching on Full Screen<br/>\nAnti-Aliasing.  You don&#39;t have to turn it up very high; halfway or one notch<br/>\nless should be more than enough to clear up jaggies and freaky ground<br/>\ntextures.  It did on mine while I had the Prophet 2 64MB and a PIII 500.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
