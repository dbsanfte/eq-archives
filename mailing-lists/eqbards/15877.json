Also does<br/>\nit make you ineligible for Selo&#39;s drum and Horn of War?<br/>\nA few improvements in your equipment I might add if you dont mind which<br/>\nyou&#39;re probably already aware of.<br/>\nWear Imbrued gloves (assuming you have them), the lambent ones are just<br/>\nawful looking. If you&#39;re ever able to get a Tranix crown, wear that over<br/>\nImbrued (assuming you dont have one). Imbrued helm also looks awful =).<br/>\nCrested spaulders -better ac and hp, dex useless since your weapons dont<br/>\nproc. Hooded black cloak if you&#39;re lucky enough to obtain one - the 45<br/>\nhp outweighs the extra 2 ac on cloak of shadows in my opinion.<br/>\nDiamondine earrings - 122 charisma is plenty so you can afford to lose<br/>\nthe opallines, especially if you choose Tranix over Imbrued.<br/>\nI&#39;m still trying to figure out why your dex is so high. Imbrued BP (13),<br/>\nbracer (3), Gloves (5), Belt (10), Pauldrons (7 or 9?), Cloak (5). Also<br/>\nhow much hp does the bolster belt give you? I&#39;m assuming roughly 30 hp.<br/>\nPlease let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
