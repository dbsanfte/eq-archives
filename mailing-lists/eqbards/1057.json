I&#39;ve been doing a<br/>\nlot of travel lately (have actually lost one bubble in<br/>\nexperience for the weekend due to intermittent deaths), and<br/>\nonce you get to learn the lands, the trip from Kelethin to<br/>\nErudin is not that outrageous.  If you get lucky and don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to wait long for the boats, you should be able to make it<br/>\nin just over an hour.  I&#39;ve just decided to start adventuring<br/>\nin the area that holds my next song.  I get to see more of the<br/>\nworld that way (elephants and centaurs and mermaids, oh my).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, some of the songs are just not worth the trip, and I&#39;ve<br/>\ndeferred those until I happen to be in the area (the Charisma<br/>\nand Identify songs in particular).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
