You\r<br/>\n&gt; get your group and go get it (brand new PoF, Assn room 2 to 6 hour camp,\r<br/>\n&gt; early Dragoon Dirk when DVinn dropped one every time, whatever) and you\r<br/>\n&gt; kill the mob and get your loot. Who is to say that you knew it was a bug?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the case of the Guise.. from the fact it says on the item stats bard rogue only, makes it fairly clear something is wrong here.  Granted Verant holds blame for this but it does not lessen the fact that no one has the &quot;right&quot; to be surprised such a fix would be implimented.  In the case of the Dirk... well I don&#39;t know much you could call that a bug as much as a change of fate.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&gt; Aside from &#39;duping&#39; items with buggy trade windows or whatever, if the game\r<br/>\n&gt; gives it to you, it should be yours - imho. If they think something needs\r<br/>\n&gt; to be changed, I favor the method of not dropping the item any more - ala\r<br/>\n&gt; manastones.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t CHANGE the item they fixed it and so I don&#39;t see how the logic applies.  It would apply for example the box, but this was a fix to a long standing and clearly marked mistake.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&gt; All this stuff about &#39;class balance&#39; and whether an item is &#39;bugged&#39; (guise\r<br/>\n&gt; lets you get the spell even if you cant wear it - which you need to do to\r<br/>\n&gt; get the stats) is a matter of opinion.\tIf the game lets you do it - it&#39;s\r<br/>\n&gt; legal (aside from real cheats like duping). \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis is a common mistake and is summed up best as &quot;ignorance of the law is not a defence.&quot;  Sometimes you have to accept that not everything is going to go your way, and that if you continue to do something your aren&#39;t supposed to eventually you will be caught.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&gt; To make it &#39;illegal&#39; after the\r<br/>\n&gt; fact and magically change the items, will just hurt the players who have\r<br/>\n&gt; them and not help the ones who don&#39;t. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t illegal after the fact.. it was illegal from the begining enforcement was delayed.  As for those who have them.. they should be fixed retroactivly in my opinion.  And it will in fact help the ones who don&#39;t it now means that fewer will try and take the guise from a rogue or bard who wants the item.  As opposed to preventing the bard to give it to the troll who wants to be tiny.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&gt;(This is sounding a lot like\r<br/>\n&gt; &#39;twinking&#39; good or bad arguments but let&#39;s not go there ;p)  I don&#39;t think\r<br/>\n&gt; its fair to change stuff because they think it &quot;should be.&quot; It&#39;s like their\r<br/>\n&gt; nerfing of Selo&#39;s and breaking roots - they gave you something and it was\r<br/>\n&gt; good - but now they think its too good and nerf it. Now it&#39;s getting down\r<br/>\n&gt; to a matter of opinion on what is good, too good, or &#39;obvious bug.&#39;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI tend to agree with you here but agian Selo&#39;s was a change where as the guise was a fix.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&gt; &quot;But Sylly, what about all those DE Pallidans and DE Barbarian Shamans???\r<br/>\n&gt; That is not good Role Play!!&quot;  Ahh, enter the rp police.  BAH!\tSo what if a\r<br/>\n&gt; Pally looks like a DE?\tThat&#39;s a lot better than the Pally&#39;s who don&#39;t heal\r<br/>\n&gt; others, who don&#39;t help others, who are just jerks in general.  That&#39;s true\r<br/>\n&gt; bad role play - but nothing can be done to stop that so fussing about some\r<br/>\n&gt; goofy mask with an illusion spell is hardly going to fix all or even any\r<br/>\n&gt; significant amount of bad rp problems.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere you have a point\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger\r<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 38th song\r<br/>\n&gt; somewhere on Innoruuk\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; \t\t-----Original Message-----\r<br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]\r<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSent:\tMonday, December 13, 1999 11:23 AM\r<br/>\n&gt; \t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>\r<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Re:Re: Guise of the Deceiver\r<br/>\n&gt; (Longish)\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; \t\tOn Mon, 13 Dec 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a> wrote:\r<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; decided it was too useful.
