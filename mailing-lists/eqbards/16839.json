Just to set the record<br/>\nstraight, I said I&#39;ve never been offered more than 7pp for a HQ Bear pelt.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say I&#39;d ever let one go for that.  The only one I&#39;ve given away was<br/>\nto someone I knew.  And when you get right down to it, I probably would have<br/>\ngiven it to him for nothing.  But we were both playing rogues and both<br/>\nroleplaying to some extent, so he HAD (emphasis on the word, not shouting)<br/>\nto give me something in return.   He gave me two fine steel piercing<br/>\nweapons, a dexterity ring, and one other item that escapes my memory (not<br/>\nanything really valuable).  Bad trade on my part?  Probably.  Am I worried<br/>\nabout it?  Nope.  Another of my characters has been looting Gnome guard<br/>\ncorpses, so that 35pp I could have gotten for the pelt has made it into my<br/>\ngrubby little hands just the same.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt all works out in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, FEMALE bard of 10 verses, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n(emphasis on the word as well as shouting that time &lt;g&gt; I mean really, does<br/>\nEvulia sound like a masculine name to you?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 24, 2000 5:49 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Slashing weapons for bards question...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 24 Mar 2000, Kevin L.

Talk about reading more into a message that the author<br/>\n&gt; intended.  I never said he was a fool.

Picking on him is just going to make him <br/>\n&gt; feel put upon and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; put down on.  He chose to do it, it&#39;s over.  He knows he <br/>\n&gt; could have made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more money.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Picking on him about it really is out of line.  Especially <br/>\n&gt; when I&#39;m sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each of us, at one time or another, has made a stupid sale <br/>\n&gt; or trade.   I<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not picking on him.  I&#39;m confirming that the true value of<br/>\n&gt; these things is in the 25-35pp range.  I don&#39;t care what he<br/>\n&gt; chooses to do with that knowledge.  I just wanted to be sure<br/>\n&gt; he knew the true value, because I hate jerks who take<br/>\n&gt; advantage of newbies ignorant about prices.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
