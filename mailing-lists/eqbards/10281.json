Thank you all very much","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1373466513\">Since I asked about dual weild just a few days ago, I have received <br/>\nwonderful amounts of useful information and advice from you all. Thank you <br/>\nall very much for teaching me the ways of weaving and chain/fear&#39;ing and <br/>\nother assorted fight and merchanting techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\n   It&#39;s strange though for me how it came up. I was in Lava or Najena at the <br/>\ntime with a full group. I was in no particular hurry to get back to the <br/>\nguild to train or anything, but when I attempted to equip two melee weapons, <br/>\nI could not. I was like ok, I do indeed have to go train on it - no big <br/>\ndeal. Upon arriving to that guy outside the bard guild in Freeport, I <br/>\nscrolled down to my skill to start the basics of. Amazingly enough, I saw <br/>\nthat they would charge me 1pp and something to train. WOW no thanks I&#39;ll <br/>\ntalk to you later!! LOL When I went back to fight I was able to weild both <br/>\nhands with a weapon. So no harm done, only a little confusion. =)<br/>\n   I just thought I&#39;d mention it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPava, Bard of the Dual Wield Measure<br/>\nSilent Dragons<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
