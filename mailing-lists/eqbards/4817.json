I&#39;ve enjoyed many of the threads here, disliked some of the bickering.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThought I&#39;d post a couple Signs you&#39;ve been playing to much EQ as posted to our guild message board by two members, maybe you&#39;ll get a grin:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n1. You have to squelch a cry of &quot;Griff&quot; when you catch a glimpse of a low-flying small aircraft. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n2. You mutter &quot;Why don&#39;t people loot their kills&quot; as you pass a dead animal on the side of the road. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n3. You finally camp for the night, and reaching your bedroom, say &quot;Hail, a irate spouse&quot;. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDejaThoris\r<br/>\n--\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n4) When your spouse enters the room and sees you at the computer, she automatically cons red and &quot;poised ready to attack - what would you like your tombstone to say?&quot; \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n5) You know the family pet will give you no exp, but you really need a pair of fur-lined gloves.....\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSilmaril\r<br/>\n--\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOn another note I&#39;m just about to get Lullaby and I fight in large groups whenever possible, what song combo would you suggest? (I&#39;ve got full banded, snakeskin gloves & mask and a dragoon dirk)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLakosh\r<br/>\nBard of the 14th Chord\r<br/>\nTunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
