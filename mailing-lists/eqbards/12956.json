Of course the druid also knows how to solo both maid<br/>\nand butler rooms, but he&#39;s not up for spending the time it takes to get<br/>\nanother fang (i.e. luck was vastly on your side with the drops).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf only bardic starfire could be cast less than once a day..<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren Notechaser, final movement of 44th composition<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
