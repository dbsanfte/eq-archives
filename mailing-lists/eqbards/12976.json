Therefore I am joining pickup groups and dieing more than I<br/>\n&gt;probably would if I had a regular group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I find it annoying that we don&#39;t get bind affinity, mainly because we are<br/>\n&gt;the weakest of all melee classes, however we are one of the bes classes at<br/>\n&gt;agro&#39;ing mobs onto us, I think Verant should consider either giving bards<br/>\n&gt;bind affinity OR, give us a song that allows us to Feing Death, monks are<br/>\n&gt;very similar to bards, being weak (lack of AC & hp&#39;s), and they deal a hell<br/>\n&gt;of a lotta dmg, so they tend to take alot of dmg, however they can just<br/>\n&gt;feign death and they are fine, I rarely see a monk has been killed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Verant say that having melee&#39;ers bound outside a dungeon is unfair because<br/>\n&gt;they can just get killed and zone back in and join in on the fight again,<br/>\n&gt;this is not the case with bards, we have to mem songs (as we all know this<br/>\n&gt;takes a good 5 minutes). And how are we gonna be any good unless we pick up<br/>\n&gt;ALL of our equipment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I find it an insult that when fighting in Cazic, Guk or the Sol&#39;s I have to<br/>\n&gt;run all the way from Freeport or Arena just to get back to my corpse,<br/>\n&gt;aswell as mem my songs and loose an hours worth of hard earned exp. To be<br/>\n&gt;honest it is starting to **** me off and as I die about 5 times (at least)<br/>\n&gt;every level this is wasting my valuable playing time, hence the reason I<br/>\n&gt;have now started up a cleric, it&#39;s great, I get bind, gate etc and if I do<br/>\n&gt;die, I&#39;ll only have to spend 20 seconds memming my spells. + at later<br/>\n&gt;levels I&#39;ll be able to res myself  =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I enjoy playing my bard and have got to level 33 through alot of hard work,<br/>\n&gt;I have great equipment for my level and am VERY keen to get to level 40+<br/>\n&gt;but I jus can&#39;t see it happening, I don&#39;t know how you level 40+ bards on<br/>\n&gt;this list do it.  I spoke to a level 50 bard on my server (Tegamen, I<br/>\n&gt;think), he was wearing some imbrued and had some great equipment. So I<br/>\n&gt;asked him if he had any tips on how to level fast, he replied &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot; I<br/>\n&gt;said that I find it very hard not to die, he replied &quot;Trust me, Bards got<br/>\n&gt;the bad deal&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Guess thats sums it all up then, I am still determined to reach level 50,<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;ll just take me a few years  =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Madagan Songweaver, Bard of 33 Songs &lt;Lords of Chaos&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Meklon, Level 7 Cleric of Innurok &lt;Lords of chaos&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Veeshan Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree.  I usually find myself joining pickup groups.  What I have found<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;that in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;considering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the<br/>\n&gt;problem is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;magnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so when<br/>\n&gt;I play<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;its usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull<br/>\n&gt;turns bad<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;and someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far<br/>\n&gt;away,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the<br/>\n&gt;casters<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;leave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get back<br/>\n&gt;to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;zone they died in.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this<br/>\n&gt;into<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;consideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.<br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;think they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play<br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;all the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs<br/>\n&gt;personal<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;welfare.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;The information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\n&gt;intended for the addressee only.
