I just wanted to point out that saying bards can&#39;t bind<br/>\nbecause they are hybrids really wasn&#39;t that valid.  Especially if you<br/>\ncontinue it to say that melee-major hybrids can&#39;t bind therefore bards can&#39;t<br/>\nbind, because we are not melee-major hybrids we are more caster-major<br/>\nhybrids like druids/clerics/shamans.  Really the best thing would be if<br/>\neveryone had the same bind rules. Having npc&#39;s albeit expensive ones that<br/>\ncould bind you to a city would not harm the economy and would stop the<br/>\ncomplaint of not being able to get bound.  There would always be pc&#39;s<br/>\nlooking for cash or to help out who would still bind for less or for<br/>\ndonations.  If casters could only bind in cities there would also be a lot<br/>\nmore of them around in cities so they could mem bind, bind a couple of<br/>\ntravellers, and recover mana while memorizing their other spells after<br/>\ndying.  The way it is now casters have little reason to come into cities and<br/>\nI think you will find that cities contain more non-casters than casters,<br/>\nwhile on the whole casters far outnumber non-casters in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 1:16 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not valid, cleric/druids/shamans are as much of hybrids as we are and can<br/>\n&gt; all bind.
