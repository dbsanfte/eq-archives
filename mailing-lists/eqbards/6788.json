If any Orcs showed up, I would attack with my <br/>\nfists.  While not necessary for raising skills, I also positioned myself to affect as many Orcs as possible.  <br/>\nYou should only do this when it is well-camped, so the other frenzied groups tank for you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn at least three occasions, I was able to get credit for four Orcs at once, even though they were being <br/>\nattacked by multiple groups (and solo Wizards) around me (gotta love that &quot;random&quot; number generator).  (Not <br/>\nsure how well this works with the new anti-DOT rules, I&#39;ve been out of town for three weeks.)  Curiously <br/>\nenough, I was never accused of kill stealing.  Other players, however, really HATE the pulse message that the <br/>\nsong generates.  I would constantly get messages like:  &quot;Kenross, what are you trying to cast on me?&quot;, <br/>\n&quot;Kenross, stop that!&quot; and the ubiquitous &quot;KENROSS, SHUT UP!!!!!!!&quot;.  I also got a lot of threats about <br/>\nreporting me to the GM for spamming them.  I finally got disgusted and set up a social key:<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross says &quot;I am practicing my feeble Brass skills.&quot;<br/>\nKenross says &quot;It is an area damage song.&quot;<br/>\nKenross says &quot;It is my only Brass Instruments song.&quot;<br/>\nKenross says &quot;I am not PVP, so it won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;<br/>\nKenross says &quot;Sorry for the annoyance, complain to Verant.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really want to maximize your kills there, you could weave in the Level 2 song and the Bellow also, but I <br/>\nwas being lazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, Level 24 Bard, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Anyone care to guess why so many Bards on this board are from my server?
