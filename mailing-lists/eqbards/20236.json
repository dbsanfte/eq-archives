It&#39;s safe, but boring.  Melee heavy groups, you have <br/>\nhuge melee buff songs against singles, charm for 2 or 3 MOB pulls, fear and Selo&#39;s <br/>\nfor more. hehe.  Caster heavy groups, you&#39;re a little young, but when you get mana <br/>\nsong, those rock.  Pets tank, you debuff/clarity.  Or you tank, they nuke.  They&#39;ll <br/>\nall love it.  Pre-32 it&#39;s a little tougher, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 51 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not sure we are third rate at everything, but things like the lullaby<br/>\n&gt; nerf are distressing.  I&#39;ve gotten left out of two groups in the last week<br/>\n&gt; because they &quot;needed&quot; an enchanter for crowd control.  They were both 4 tank<br/>\n&gt; groups so clarity wasn&#39;t really an issue.  They said, and I believe them,<br/>\n&gt; that if my crowd control songs weren&#39;t broken they would have rather had me<br/>\n&gt; in the group since I could help them out with downtime (they had no healers<br/>\n&gt; other than a ranger).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I play a bard primarily for RP reasons, but I think the bard class is a good<br/>\n&gt; one.  If they would fix our broken or useless songs we would be fine.  Most<br/>\n&gt; of the weakness I perceive in the bard class is not because of Verant&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; vision of a bard.  It is mostly because Verant has made melee classes so<br/>\n&gt; much less common than casting ones through some of their decisions.  EQ is<br/>\n&gt; definitely a caster&#39;s game powerwise.  Melee characters might get all the<br/>\n&gt; neat toys, but caster&#39;s get all the things that make playing easier.  If I<br/>\n&gt; played with less casual players maybe it wouldn&#39;t be as much of an issue.<br/>\n&gt; Every time I get in a melee heavy group we have a great time and I can<br/>\n&gt; contribut enormously.  In a caster heavy group all the weaknesses of the<br/>\n&gt; bard class come to the forefront, and if there&#39;s an enchanter present I feel<br/>\n&gt; pretty useless.  Unfortunately caster heavy groups seem to outnumber tank<br/>\n&gt; heavy ones by about 5-1 at least.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Kit </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
