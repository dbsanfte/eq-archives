Our mob<br/>\n&gt; would make a B line for the cleric and we would be off chasing our pull.<br/>\n&gt; This happened several times. I asked the cleric if perchance he was casting<br/>\n&gt; on our mob or healing us or anything. Nope..  the mob just hated a 50th<br/>\n&gt; cleric helping anyone I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My (cynical) guess would be that the other group had a bard in<br/>\nit, and your mob was partially aggro to their bard due to bard<br/>\nhate.
