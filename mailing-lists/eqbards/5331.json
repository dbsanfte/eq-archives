Medium armor does not say MEDIUM it says ARMOR. But<br/>\nyou will find that it IS medium if you compare it to SMALL. and even if<br/>\nyou did not buy it for AC or WEIGHT, you will find that the additional<br/>\nweight sucks with our lower strength. I don;t know ANYONE that is not<br/>\nconcerned with weight... and if you are not, just wait, you will be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe poster who replied to you was just saying that SMALL armor was<br/>\navailable, and it was close and it weighs less that the armor you<br/>\nbought. Why not buy armor that looks the same, is same AC, and weighs<br/>\nLESS?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1999 05:54:52 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Lowest price possible on medium steel<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Call me crazy (shouts from the crowd &#39;YOUR CRAZY&#39;) but<br/>\n&gt; upon further inspection of my bronze, no where on it<br/>\n&gt; does it have a size, much like blackened iron, which<br/>\n&gt; can be slid off of a wood elf and on to, say, a troll.<br/>\n&gt;  And besides, I didn&#39;t buy it for ac or weight, I<br/>\n&gt; bought it for looks.
