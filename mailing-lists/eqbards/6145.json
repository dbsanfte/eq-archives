The best damage you could probably do with songs would be the<br/>\nL48 song and CoD, as both are string songs, and they definately wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbeat the damage you could do with dual Ykesha&#39;s. In fact they don&#39;t even<br/>\ncome close to the damage you can do with a claw and dirk from what I can<br/>\nsee. As well, that means you would also only be able to play one other<br/>\nparty buff song, and our best attack song at that level is berzerker&#39;s<br/>\nwhich is horn.  If any other L48+ bard has figured out a way to do more<br/>\ndamage with instruments I&#39;d appreciate hearing it.<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\njust curious as I am much lower level than you and thus my experience may <br/>\nnot be quite as extensive, but are you working damage upon multiple mobs at <br/>\nonce into the equation?<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, one on one, I have no doubts you are correct.  But I wonder about <br/>\ngroup on group.........</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
