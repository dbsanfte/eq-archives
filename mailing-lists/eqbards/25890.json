Shouldn&#39;t the two numbers for the two sexes be nearly identical? Are<br/>\n52% of the women lesbians, 26% playing with the other 26%?<br/>\n<br/>\nMore likely this shows the invalidity of the entire survey, because the<br/>\nvoters are self-selecting, and a different kind of female chooses to waste<br/>\nhis time taking the survey than male. My wife not only wouldn&#39;t take it, but<br/>\n(she&#39;s quite controlling, and our greatest source of tension is that I<br/>\ncannot<br/>\nbe controlled) she actually complained that I was wasting time when she saw<br/>\nme taking it.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nCoffee contains water...so does your pee<br/>\n<br/>\nWeb: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.IAmKaz.com/\">http://www.IAmKaz.com/</a><br/>\nE-Mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KazVorpal@...\">KazVorpal@...</a><br/>\nAIM/Yahoo/AOL Instant Messenger: KazVorpal<br/>\nICQ#: 1912557<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
