Unfortunatly in your (and I&#39;m<br/>\nsure lots of people&#39;s, since I hear this all the time) veiw, what others<br/>\nplayers have/do affect your enjoyment.  (And I don&#39;t mean directly as in<br/>\ntraining half a dungeon on your head, but rather indirectly in that you want<br/>\nto feel price in your accomplishments and feel your accomplisments are<br/>\nlessened when others achieve them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther people have different veiws (in this case they just wish to have the<br/>\nitems/experience of being on the planes/whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unfortunate part is their veiw conflicts with yours (and again, I dont<br/>\nmean to point at YOU but rather you as a group who share similar veiws).<br/>\nTheres not much that can be done about this, as both groups of people have<br/>\nthe right to play the game.  You (and your comrades) know how you got your<br/>\nplanar gear, let that be enough.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
