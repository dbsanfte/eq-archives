I have an<br/>\noriginal Soundblaster Live purchased shortly after it was released.  The<br/>\nvast majority of the problems are from people who don&#39;t keep their drivers<br/>\ncurrent.  Also - there are problems with people who updated the drivers -<br/>\nbut not the &quot;Liveware&quot; Software.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the alternative; the A3D chipset is made by Aureal.  They also<br/>\nwent into the business of producing cards themselves.  Aureal is on the<br/>\nverge of bankruptcy.  If they don&#39;t get an investor or are bought out - you<br/>\ncould face the prospect of having unsupported software.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been more than pleased with my SB Live - and I&#39;ve never had a single<br/>\nproblem with it.  Just make sure you keep the drivers and Liveware<br/>\nup-to-date.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mike Roach&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 03, 2000 8:05 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] New messages<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Speaking of building a new machine, what do you recommend as far as<br/>\nhardware<br/>\n&gt; is concerned for a relatively high-end system that EQ will run well on?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I currently use Dual SLI Voodoo2 cards and glide drivers and I know there<br/>\n&gt; are issues with Mip mapping, gamma correction, and clip plane on other<br/>\n&gt; chipsets (TnT?).
