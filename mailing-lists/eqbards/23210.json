I hit the mob with Cessation (16% attack speed<br/>\ndebuff according to Rokenn&#39;s EQSongs website).  I assume the enchanter was<br/>\nusing Shiftless Deeds (49%-65% attack speed debuff according to EQ Casters<br/>\nRealm) since he was high enough level to cast it.  Obviously the enchanter<br/>\nspell is better than Cessation.  Cessation was in effect on the mob when the<br/>\nenchanter cast Shiftless Deeds.  As soon as he cast it, I got a message that<br/>\nCessation wore off (before it should have wore off had it lasted its normal<br/>\nduration).  Immediately after I got that message I got the message that<br/>\nShiftless Deeds stuck (something like &quot;a mob has been slowed&quot;).  This<br/>\nindicates Shiftless Deeds overwrote Cessation, which is contrary to how<br/>\nbard/enchanter/shaman slows have interacted in the past.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have always been under the impression that if a bard slow song (Largos,<br/>\nChains, Cessation, etc) was in effect when an enchanter/shaman attempted to<br/>\nslow the mob, the enchanter/shaman spell would not stick.  However, its<br/>\npossible that the way the song/spells interact has recently been changed (to<br/>\nthe better) without official notification in a patch message.  Thats what I<br/>\nam trying to confirm.  So to iterate, it now appears that enchanter/shaman<br/>\nslow spells will overwrite bard slow songs.  Has anyone else noticed this?  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 16, 2001 12:14 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Chains&#92;Binding no longer overwrites snare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThey fixed slow spells a couple of months ago.  Better slows will not<br/>\noverwrite weaker slows.  That is why you got the wore off message.

This past weekend I was grouped with <br/>\n&gt; an enchanter.<br/>\n&gt; I had Chords of Cessation memmed but was not singing it until <br/>\n&gt; the enchanter<br/>\n&gt; slowed the mob.  During one fight the enchanter was late <br/>\n&gt; slowing the mob so<br/>\n&gt; I went ahead and used Cessation.  After my song went into effect, the<br/>\n&gt; enchanter cast his slow spell.  I got a message saying the my <br/>\n&gt; Cessation song<br/>\n&gt; wore off immediately followed by the message that the <br/>\n&gt; enchanter&#39;s slow spell<br/>\n&gt; stuck.  I got the Cessation effect &quot;wore off&quot; message before <br/>\n&gt; the song&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; normal duration passed.  So it appeared that the enchanter&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; slow spell<br/>\n&gt; overwrote Cessation.  So what I am wondering is if the <br/>\n&gt; enchanter slow spell<br/>\n&gt; actually negated Cessation or if the enchanter&#39;s slow message <br/>\n&gt; was an error<br/>\n&gt; and his slow did not stick?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mott, Mike J.
