I logged on after it was over and<br/>\nGallenite informed me that Precept had formed a joint group of<br/>\nUnbidden/Pantheon people who took her down.  I wasn&#39;t aware that people<br/>\noutside those two guilds were also part of the effort or I would have done<br/>\nmore that simply congratulate the guild leaders.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Peridot plat rings, Runed Bone Fork, Cloak of the Ice bear,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tAck!  I lent out my Runed Bone Fork and forgot to get it back,<br/>\nthanks for reminding me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   You are blasted by freezing winds.  ~800 hp poof, gone.<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;d have to estimate the other tanks in the group were taking the <br/>\n&gt;   same breath weapon damage, with only 140 total cold.  Take that<br/>\n&gt;   as you may.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tIt was cast twice then.  The AE at full damage doesn&#39;t even do<br/>\n800.  ~400 a shot is still high though and I&#39;ve never seen that much<br/>\ndamage when I was at Vox, even without a bard in my group with Miriana<br/>\n(Naggy is a different story).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   And while I still speculate that the random generator&#39;s involvement<br/>\n&gt;   in how much breath damage you take is large, I can assert that it<br/>\n&gt;   doesn&#39;t hurt to beef up your cold, if nothing more than to show off.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tYeah, unfortunately we have no way of knowing how resists factor<br/>\nin to the actual damage number, but most people reported dramatic<br/>\nimprovements.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   * Never face the dragon.  This cuts visual lag by 50% easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tOf fg&#39;s, or monsters in planes, or....  Hehe, any multi group<br/>\nevent is &quot;stare at wall&quot; time for me :).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   * Twisting is almost impossible, you have to count and twist<br/>\n&gt;     in order to get the songs running.  If you wait for the visual<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tWith 48 people, yeah, it&#39;s impossible, but with 24 the lag is<br/>\nmanagable.  The text cues with 24 people are about 1 second behind but if<br/>\nyou&#39;re only twisting 2 songs that&#39;s fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     Although Vox was moving around a lot, I had to compensate to.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tYeah, Vox does seem to move around alot more than Naggy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   dragon, smooth.  heh.  Only a few people died, I don&#39;t know why<br/>\n&gt;   or under what circumstances, but two of the melee groups had no<br/>\n&gt;   bard, and they did just fine.  The rogue died I know, after throwing<br/>\n&gt;   a few BS&#39;s in.  And a couple of tanks who weren&#39;t getting the proper<br/>\n&gt;   healing, too.  No one in my group died, or LD&#39;d - thank god.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tAccording to Gallenite, all 3 deaths were due to LD&#39;s (and thereby<br/>\nunhealable).  The real solution is to make 24 people sit in the king room<br/>\nwhile the other 24 attack Vox.  With so many people going LD if you throw<br/>\n48 people at something you&#39;ve cut your effectiveness by nearly half<br/>\nanyways.  Of course, no one wants to have the job of picking the 24 to<br/>\nstay behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana<br/>\nLegions of Darkness<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
