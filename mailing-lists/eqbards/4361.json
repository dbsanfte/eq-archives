Go into a newbie zone and pick a<br/>\nfight with an orc pawn or a gnoll pup.  They cant hurt you because of your<br/>\nac and your hp rebuilds faster than they can damage you.  But you will be<br/>\npunching them for 1 point of damage.  Now you should be getting into groups<br/>\nwhere they are attacking monsters that are so much higher than you that your<br/>\nnormal weps are having trouble damaging them.  Your role in that case will<br/>\nbe equiping an instrument and playing songs. So magic gloves and hand to<br/>\nhand combat with monsters that you can barley hit with a Dirk or Combine are<br/>\nnot gonna do any good.  Even lower level monsters that your regular weps can<br/>\nhit will be hitting you and your party pretty hard.  If you are in the<br/>\nmelee, you will be at risk of getting stunned and not having your songs be<br/>\nused all of the time.  And you will get beat up for no gain.  My 2cp &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou would be better off standing off outside of melee and supporting your<br/>\nparty 100% of the time (no stuns to interupt you).<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I could be wrong - I have only had 2 or 3 partys and monster combos<br/>\nwhere I was able to do this stand off support role.  but I have done the h2h<br/>\ncombat thing and it was pitiful!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, July 26, 1999 1:28 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Magical Gloves?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t     The other day someone offered me Black iron gloves.
