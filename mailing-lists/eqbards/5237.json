(processor, ram, video ram, free<br/>\nDASD/virtual mem - whichever is smaller, modem, typical connect speed,<br/>\nanything else I may be forgetting)  I know I could use a bit of a hardware<br/>\nupgrade, just wondering how little I can get away with. Also, what in-game<br/>\nsacrifices have you made in the options to be able to weave/mix/twist so<br/>\nsuccessfully?<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI I&#39;m using P200 MMX, 64ram, 16 video, 100 mg free all allocated to<br/>\nvirtual memory, 64 winmodem that usually connects at 44.  I forgot to write<br/>\ndown my option settings, but I know I&#39;ve got single layer sky & sound<br/>\nrealism all the way up.  The rest I&#39;d have to check when I get home.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: this is not to restart a debate on modems or anything else.  Please<br/>\nthink of it as a survey & don&#39;t pounce on anyone who handles the game<br/>\ndifferently from you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance to any who help.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvulia of Tunare<br/>\nKingbird of Brell Serilis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
