While it&#39;s<br/>\ndoable without an enchanter, I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to<br/>\n&quot;NEVER&quot; expect more than 2.  (Normally charm is good enough to<br/>\ncontrol a 3-mob pull.  The problem with the DW gobs is that<br/>\nthey&#39;re all named &quot;deepwater goblin&quot; but some of them are<br/>\ncasters.  If your group is fighting one gob and the two you&#39;re<br/>\ncharming turn out to be casters, you&#39;re going to be eating a<br/>\nlot of nukes in between charms.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, *ideally* you want an enchanter, healer, and<br/>\nsomeone who can cast harmony.  You can do it without the<br/>\nenchanter, but I found the fights to be much much easier (like<br/>\nzoning two times vs. only losing 0-2 bubbles) with an<br/>\nenchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; pull from Oasis, you need only to run to the inn.   The caster will come up<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pulling to the inn makes it a bit harder to use fear.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; far enough so that it can see you to nuke.  When it does, have a tank engage<br/>\n&gt; it, snare and fear it.  Won&#39;t get another cast off the rest of the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is by far the easiest way to do it (assuming you don&#39;t<br/>\npull an extra caster).  Another benefit of using fear is that<br/>\nit&#39;ll disperse those annoying green undead who seem to like to<br/>\ncrash the fights.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, the inn is a GREAT area for fear and snare since the MOBS will tend to<br/>\n&gt; walk back and forth rather then run across the zone when feared here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, the area we found they do this in was also<br/>\nclose enough to the water for the casters to nuke us while out<br/>\nof sight.  :(  We had enough tankage that I let them beat on<br/>\nus until they were at half health, then I chain-feared them<br/>\nwhile they stood in place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe loot on the goblins is not that great - bronze and rusty<br/>\nweapons.  So keep an eye out for sand giants to fill out the<br/>\npurse.  Also be aware that people running from the spectres<br/>\ntend to run straight through the area near the inn on their<br/>\nway to the S Ro zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are biggest problem was the newbies fighting DW Gob pets got pissed at us<br/>\n&gt; for stealing their bread and butter.  We just made sure that when we left,<br/>\n&gt; all 6 were spawning pets.  Man there were a lot of newbies crowding the lake<br/>\n&gt; for them!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dunno if it was due to their buggy behavior, but the pets<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t suicide after I charmed them.  I suspect charm/invis<br/>\nwould&#39;ve worked, but that&#39;s a waste of a song slot.  Find a<br/>\ngroup hunting the pets and take any pets over to them.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
