I recently<br/>\nattained my 15th level and ran to the bards guild in Kelethin to get<br/>\nKellin&#39;s Lucid Lullabye.  I went to www.harpers.net and took a look at the<br/>\nwriteup for this song. I am not sure of the proper usage for this song. How<br/>\nshould I use it say if I were approaching a dervish camp (like the one in<br/>\nOasis) with my group as opposed to using it in Unrest?  I did approach a few<br/>\nbards who were over level 17 asking how exactly they used the song and I was<br/>\ntold on 2 occasions that they had gotten into more trouble than it was worth<br/>\nwith this song and not to use it.  After lurking on this list for the last<br/>\ncouple of weeks it seems that there are plenty of you out there who know how<br/>\nto make this song work to your advantage and I&#39;d like to know how I should<br/>\napproach this song.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance for any help you can give me. I am very very happy<br/>\nplaying my bard and can&#39;t see myself playing any other character. But then<br/>\nagain, maybe I&#39;m just a wood elf in human&#39;s clothing =)<br/>\n<br/>\nToxia<br/>\nBard 15th Circle, Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
