I love that zone as a Ranger.<br/>\nAs a Bard it&#39;s suicide.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason the Goblins in SolA are completely impervious to Lament<br/>\n(Annoying!!!!) even if it says they&#39;re sad they&#39;ll still come after you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoblins in general have a seriously low tolerance for music.  I&#39;ve found<br/>\nthat almost ANYTHING you sing there will get them aggro on you (even<br/>\nwhistling warsong, our self-only buff).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s indoor (no running away).<br/>\n<br/>\nPathing is a nightmare:  VERY easy to pull a monster train if you don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow to pull there.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said,  if the cleric is that much of an ass I&#39;d just find another<br/>\ngroup to hunt with.  You don&#39;t tell him how to be a cleric, he shouldn&#39;t<br/>\ntell you how to be a bard.  If it gets you attacked more than him who cares,<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t a half bad tank (esp since they fixed the bash-bug on MOBS) :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI use the following strategy in SolA:  Bind, HoR, DDD, CoD.  It gets me a<br/>\nLOT of attention but I am gonna get it anyway, I might as well hurt EVERYONE<br/>\nthat attacks me.  (I use pure instruments).  Thus I slow down our opponents<br/>\nby 30%, hurt them all at around hmm 60hp/tic and heal us all at about<br/>\n12-13hp/tic.  Generally the primary tank has no problem keeping the &quot;Current<br/>\ntarget&quot; locked on himself, I get the rest, we kill them one at a time.  By<br/>\nthe time we kill the 2nd goblin the rest are starting to either drop dead<br/>\nfrom the DOT&#39;s I&#39;m singing or are at 1/3 life and are nearly dead when we<br/>\nget to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works out very well, our group has miniscule downtime.  The<br/>\ncleric/druid/whatever concentrates only on healing me, I keep the tank<br/>\nhealed during combat with HoR.  Since our opponents are slowed and I&#39;m<br/>\nhealing I can actually heal him faster than he takes dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes a while to prove yourself in SolA because you ARE such a huge<br/>\ntarget.  But I submit that you will be a huge target in that zone REGARDLESS<br/>\nof what you sing.  So enjoy yourself ;)  If you&#39;re going to die, you may as<br/>\nwell have fun doing it ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Lyrnia<br/>\naka:  Kev<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 1:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Attack speedups<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I would try that, but the cleric would probably just let me die to prove<br/>\nhis<br/>\n&gt; point.  In Sol A it is a big taunt.  If I play Hymn and my two other songs<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; definitely get the bulk of the attention.  The last 6 times we have had<br/>\n&gt; deaths in our Sol A groups, on 5 of them the deaths have gone like this.<br/>\n&gt; 1st death: me, 2nd death: other bard (lower level), 3rd death: other melee<br/>\n&gt; person.
