My GF saw, wondered why I was on the game for hours, and now plays EQ as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have two computers, (Now), and I would be REALLY glad to get her off mine. I even already bought her<br/>\nnew accounts that I would PL her on. Now I don&#39;t have to PL her at all, she can just get transferred.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think $50 is no big deal to be able to get my account all to myself and not have to share<br/>\ncomputer time on EQ...<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel Sniderman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; If that was a &quot;problem&quot; there would be no selling or e-baying.
