While you are entitled to your opinion, I think most<br/>\n&gt; people would agree that as a community bards are very professional and<br/>\n&gt; polite and only started &quot;complaining&quot; when Abashi and GZ recently started<br/>\n&gt; playing spin doctor in regards to the Lullaby and Pixie Strike issues.  They<br/>\n&gt; are flat out wrong and every bards knows it.  Its only natural to get upset<br/>\n&gt; when someone keeps telling you everything is working as intended when you<br/>\n&gt; know its broke.  Other than that situation bards have never given Verant any<br/>\n&gt; reason to think we are a bunch of whiners and complainers.  As a class we<br/>\n&gt; are also most likely the politest in terms of online forums (mailing list<br/>\n&gt; and Concert Hall).  If you don&#39;t think so, just read the caster class forums<br/>\n&gt; at EQ Casters Realm.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The only way to get results for what we want is to be adult about it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; People do not respond to bitching and complaining in a positive way. How<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many marriages have broken up to prove that?  Once there is so much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; complaining the listening party often turns a deaf ear.  Do we want that?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Or is that what Verant has already done?  Are they tired of listening to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; constantly complaining Bards?  Is that why the focus on other classes?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To be completely cynical for a minute, I&#39;d argue that the only way to<br/>\nget results from Verant is to be a whiny brat. At least that&#39;s the<br/>\nimpression I&#39;m getting from the recent necro nerf. Can you name one<br/>\nother class that Verant has taken something away from then give 6 new<br/>\nspells or abilities to to compensate? No one could possibly claim that<br/>\nthe necros presented their case in an adult manner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
