Now I&#39;m trying to<br/>\nfigure out if its better to use this song or Nivs in order to reduce<br/>\ndowntime due to lost health.  SoS gives a 48pt runeshield against melee<br/>\nattacks with lute equipped.  Nivs heals 12 pts of damage with lute equipped<br/>\nplus gives a 20 pt runeshield against magic attacks.  The extra STR from<br/>\nNivs doesn&#39;t really affect downtime so I don&#39;t consider that a factor when<br/>\ndeciding between the two songs.  Against melee-only mobs, SoS appears to be<br/>\nthe best choice while Niv&#39;s is better against caster mobs.  So far I have<br/>\nprimarily used these songs when there is no cleric in the group and the<br/>\ndruid/shaman needs some help keeping everyone alive.  Would like to hear how<br/>\neveryone else uses these two songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n49 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
