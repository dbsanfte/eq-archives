Hee hee, maybe the bards on Veeshan<br/>\nare a mor mature.... oh wait no we just have lots of japanese uber players.<br/>\neesh.  Why can&#39;t we have another server and station it in japan for them.  Its<br/>\nreallya pain when you get online at say, 10:00 AM on your day off and expect to<br/>\nhave a server population of 600-1000 and scroll down to find veeshan has 1800<br/>\npeople on it.

I once<br/>\n&gt; mentioned the bard I grouped with who never played anything but Hymn<br/>\n&gt; (constantly, even when everyone was healed), Accelerando (of course), and<br/>\n&gt; Bellow.  She only bellowed in battle, and you know... bellow is probably the<br/>\n&gt; least effective of any of our battle songs.  Bellow gives that instant<br/>\n&gt; gratification, it&#39;s very noticeable... but really isn&#39;t that great.  She<br/>\n&gt; said &quot;bellow is the only one that works for me.&quot;  How innane!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I saw something tonight that truely shocked me.  I was literally<br/>\n&gt; speechless.  Had damaged myself falling, and decided to heal up by the zone<br/>\n&gt; a bit before heading on.  Targeted a bard a bit off, and saw he was quite<br/>\n&gt; hurt, noticed his con around level 18 or 19.  I realized he was sitting,<br/>\n&gt; singing hymn.  I sauntered over and said, &quot;You know, that song would be much<br/>\n&gt; more effective with an instrument.&quot;  He replied, &quot;Ya, but I don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; carrying all that stuff.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Carrying all that stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;A bard who doesn&#39;t like carrying instruments???&quot;  And he just said, &quot;Yup.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; But a mandolin weighs absolutely nothing!  But the songs are much more<br/>\n&gt; effective when played, singing them is like like like....  I couldn&#39;t say<br/>\n&gt; anything.  I just said, &quot;Looks like somebody picked the wrong class....&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; zoned in disgust!  Then crashed!  My client was agast too!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s like a warrior saying he doesn&#39;t like wearing all that junk, or a mage<br/>\n&gt; saying he doesn&#39;t like learning all that stuff.  Eeeesh... that has to be<br/>\n&gt; the dumbest bard I&#39;ve ever seen.  One of those people who probably picked<br/>\n&gt; the class to be a warrior with a personal SoW.  He gives all of us a BAD<br/>\n&gt; name, just pray he solos exclusively!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Roop<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Mike Roach &lt;mroach@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; snip!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Solidarity bard brothers and sisters, we must educate the masses to our<br/>\n&gt; &gt;usefulness, especially our fellow bards like the one I ran into in Unrest<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sunday.  Here is this level 20 bard with full bronze plate and some very<br/>\n&gt; &gt;very nice unique items in a group that I join up with and I don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; &gt;realize he is a bard until I am in the group for about 15 minutes and go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;turn off the healing song and realize I am not singing it.  He is running<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and out of the house pulling green mobs (we were both the same level at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;time) and I ask him 3 times, &quot;what songs will you be singing during<br/>\n&gt; &gt;battles?&quot; so I can get an idea of what I should be using to compliment him.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Finally he responds, &quot;Bellow, unless you have any requests...&quot; and runs<br/>\n&gt; back<br/>\n&gt; &gt;into the house.  Next thing you know he is shouting &quot;zone!&quot; and runs to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;zone with a train of green monsters from the yard following him.  I thought<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I should probably have attempted to educate this fellow but instead I got<br/>\n&gt; &gt;disgusted with the whole absurd scene and excused myself from the group.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Faras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Half-Elf Bard of the 21st song<br/>\n&gt; &gt;E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Create a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n&gt; ...and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
