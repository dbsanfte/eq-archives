It will make your Selos<br/>\nAccellerando go a lot faster!  15% to 20% ? Noticably faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt come from a pretty high level monster in Mistmore - I think (makes<br/>\nsense?) Anyhow, since there are not a lot of high level bards and since it&#39;s<br/>\npretty useless to other classes, these drums are either hoarded for those<br/>\nwho might some day do a bard or given as gifts - handed down from bard to<br/>\nbard even.  I got mine at level 30 from Kalvidar who was given it (got it<br/>\ngiven to?) by Lyly - a high level cleric who looted it. (He had a spare so<br/>\nhe could give it away.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe merch birdie in SK &quot;Krak&quot; hates me or hate half-elfs or something.  I<br/>\ntried all the tricks, charisma song, stand behind and sneak, all of the and<br/>\nhe still wont sell to me - but he does not have anything special for bards -<br/>\nnot for any one for that matter unless its some loot sold to him by players<br/>\nin SK who wanted cash and dumped a rune or words that were useless to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething you could get would be a mino horn - in fact a mino axe would be<br/>\npretty good for you until you can get a combine or dirk.  Also a giant snake<br/>\nfang was my weapon du jour for many levels when I was your age.  Let&#39;s go to<br/>\nBeholder (where the minos live) and get you equipped!  They are pretty tough<br/>\nso you need some help or need to buy it from the 15 to 20&#39;s who can hunt<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on Innoruuk so send me a tell when you are in the game and say hi!<br/>\nLook forward to meeting you someday!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 32th song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJames [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, October 12, 1999 7:03 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] special instruments<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHi Im new here. My name is Magnuss from Innourkk. I am just<br/>\nlowly level 8 but I have to say this is the most fun I have had in any class<br/>\nI have played. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe question I have I have heard some rumors about special<br/>\ninstruments. Like a drum that is 3 times better then the one from the store.<br/>\nDose any one have any clue about this? I know when I was in South Karnana<br/>\nwith my wizard I found at the top of the avik village a store that was on a<br/>\nsmall ledge hidden behind a hut. Seed like it was hidden and might have<br/>\nspecial instruments but I dont remember the names. any ways if you have any<br/>\ninfo pleas let me know :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
