It used to be<br/>\neven more lucrative than brewing, I made<br/>\n30pp an hour doing pottery.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d expect the margins on that to reduce<br/>\ndramatically though.  This game is not<br/>\nabout running from vendor to wheel to<br/>\nkiln to vendor to rack up money.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, if I hadn&#39;t lost everything, and<br/>\nbeen denied a leg up kit, I&#39;d never have<br/>\ndone it.  There is a sense of accomplishment<br/>\nin EQ that comes from earning your gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a common thing in single player games<br/>\nfor people to get cheat programs, make<br/>\nthemselves unbeatable, and tire very quickly<br/>\nof the game.  Verant wants people to keep<br/>\nstriving for a significant length of time, as<br/>\nthey depend on subscription monies to<br/>\ncontinue the incremental development process.<br/>\n<br/>\nPottery, and to a lesser extent, Brewing<br/>\ncreated money in the EQ economy.  Looting<br/>\nmobs does as well, but not as consistently<br/>\n(at least not at the levels where these trade<br/>\nskills do) as pottery and brewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat V wants from trade skills is players<br/>\ncreating goods for players, not players<br/>\ncreating goods for NPC&#39;s.  Unfortunately,<br/>\nonly smithing and, to a lesser extent, jewelcraft<br/>\nafter the tweaks, act in this manner.  Worse,<br/>\nthe changes people most want to smithing,<br/>\nthe ability to smith higher grade armors and<br/>\nmagic weapons (with the help of an enchanter)<br/>\nare useless on an established server.  There is<br/>\nno window of opportunity to sell these items due<br/>\nto the glut of magic weapons and armor on the<br/>\nmarket at the level you&#39;d expect these player<br/>\nmade items to occupy.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things are necessary (IMHO) to make a<br/>\nplayer based economy work.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  A money drain.  At high levels platinum apparently<br/>\nbecomes useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere needs to be NPC provided services and goods<br/>\nthat high level players WANT and that cost a significant<br/>\namount of platinum.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  A method to take magic weapons out of circulation<br/>\nand keep them out of the hands of characters of lower<br/>\nlevels than they were intended for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that, if you put in the ability to make magic weapons<br/>\ntomorrow, smiths and enchanters would find very<br/>\nlittle market, as the items would have to compete against<br/>\nmagic weapons like the Dragoon Dirk, RTS and others<br/>\nthat provide bonuses to stats, good performance and the<br/>\nability to hit magic creatures, all at prices that players<br/>\nin their low teens can afford, simply from hunting.  (I bought<br/>\nmy first magic weapon, a tentacle whip, at level 9, for 15pp.<br/>\nGranted, I only had 20pp to my name, but I regained the<br/>\nmajority of the outlay in a 1 hr session that saw me pick up<br/>\na lightstone and two greater lightstones)<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the off-topic rant, I guess I&#39;m just tired of<br/>\npeople over on the pottery list whining about V nerfing<br/>\ntrade skills.  We were never meant to make steady<br/>\nplats selling created goods to vendors.  Clicking a mouse<br/>\nfor hours on end, with no player interaction, no exploring,<br/>\nand no risk are not in Verant&#39;s vision for the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nTindayen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Sean Gifford&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:giffords@...\">giffords@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;why do you say that?, I found the brewing I did pretty profitable,  but I<br/>\n&gt;had to give my eyes, and wrist a break after a solid half hour.<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Sean Kennedy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:orang@...\">orang@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not any more.<br/>\n&gt;    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;    From: Jeremy & Tracy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jastns@...\">jastns@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;        From: Michal Hobson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        To: EQBards &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        So scratch the gripe unless it is an extreme case.
