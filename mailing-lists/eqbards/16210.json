Their lich line of<br/>\nspells convert hp to mana at a ratio approaching 1:1 at level<br/>\n49 (c.f. 3:1 for manastones), and their lifetap spells convert<br/>\nmana back to hp while damaging the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;In other words, &quot;great solo, poor grouped&quot; is a <br/>\n&gt; &gt;contradiction.  The worst you can get is &quot;great solo,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ok grouped.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re also forgetting to account for how the solo&#39;ing<br/>\n&gt; is accomplished.

All fear does is<br/>\nincrease your survival time - I *have* accounted for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; guk.  I don&#39;t think its as clear-cut as you may think.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No it isn&#39;t as clear cut.  But my main point is that being in<br/>\na group cannot make the group *worse* than you are solo<br/>\n(stupidity excepted).  Given that necros are great soloing, a<br/>\ngroup with a necro cannot be any worse than the necro is solo.  <br/>\nSince necros are regularly able to solo some of the toughest<br/>\nmobs in the game (outside of the planes), that means any group<br/>\nwith a necro will be able to take on the toughest mobs in the<br/>\ngame.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;From someone elses post:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;All I know is that a level 50 necro in the group <br/>\n&gt; &gt;allowed us to take the lords room in lower guk easily<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and hold the room for hours without so much as a hint<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of a challenge.  He left and was replaced by a level <br/>\n&gt; &gt;50 wizard and we all died the next lord spawn and 2 <br/>\n&gt; &gt;tries later we still couldn&#39;t retake the room...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well that&#39;s a poor example.  Two different players can<br/>\n&gt; be very differing in ability to play the game.  (Being<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not knowing much about wizard mana:damage ratios, I tried to<br/>\nreserve comment on this.  But the boks, guks, and lord all<br/>\nhave a ton of hp.  It&#39;s very likely the efficiency of necro<br/>\nDoTs (along with their insane mana regen rate) compared to<br/>\nwizard DDs let the necro do a lot more damage to the mobs per<br/>\nfight than the wizard could.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the biggest causes of the caster/melee imbalance in the<br/>\ngame IMHO is that they made mobs harder by making their<br/>\nattacks more powerful.  That change hit melee classes full on,<br/>\nwhile having little impact on the casters (who have many ways<br/>\nof avoiding taking damage).  Exactly the opposite of what<br/>\nneeded to be done.  They should&#39;ve kept mob damage the same<br/>\nand increased mob hp.  Then casters wouldn&#39;t be able to kite<br/>\nmobs they weren&#39;t supposed to be able to kill solo, simply<br/>\nbecause they&#39;d run out of mana.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
