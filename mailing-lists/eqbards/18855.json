I<br/>\nused a 5/19 slash (BtC) and a 6/18 pierce (Saeiny&#39;s Dagger) to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe saeiny&#39;s dagger, even though it&#39;s in my offhand, will hit for just as<br/>\nmuch (and often slightly more) as the claw at max.  It&#39;s MINIMUM, as you<br/>\nsaid, is still 1.  So, overall, the average dmg is lower but you still DO<br/>\nget the bonus to your dmg from offhand weapon.  I haven&#39;t found it unusual<br/>\nto hit for 5 20&#39;s in a row (FBSS and haste song is a wondrous thing) with a<br/>\n5/19 and 6/18 weapon.  If we didn&#39;t get the bonus to the offhand I&#39;d never<br/>\npierce for more than 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in essence, what people are REALLY saying is:  Your offhand does not get<br/>\nthe MINIMUM dmg bonus but it does get the MAXIMUM dmg bonus.  Which means<br/>\nthat it&#39;s, effectively, getting half (avg dmg) of the dmg bonus that the<br/>\nprimary hand does.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;David Blank&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EvilNuff@...\">EvilNuff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 19, 2000 2:18 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Blade of Fiery Lamentations<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Either I misunderstood you here or you may be a bit<br/>\n&gt; off.  The scaler level bonus is (level-25)/3 (Note:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure about post 50 but this holds true up to<br/>\n&gt; 50) for 1h weapons and is primary hand only (there is<br/>\n&gt; a slightly different 2h damage scalar for 2h weapons).<br/>\n&gt;  I.e. at level 50 every time you hit with your main<br/>\n&gt; weapon you do an additional 8 points of damage.  The<br/>\n&gt; easy way to test that this is primary hand only is to<br/>\n&gt; DW two different types of weapons and log the results.<br/>\n&gt;  Look for your minimum hits not your maximum as that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a more easily identifiable number.  Your minimum hit<br/>\n&gt; with primary hand will be 1+bonus and your min with<br/>\n&gt; secondary hand will be 1.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Speaking of bunuses:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The strength and dex bonus are not applied to your<br/>\n&gt; offhand.  HOWEVER the LEVEL based Damage bonus is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Level based bonus seems to be (Bonus=(level-25))<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard level-20 but haven&#39;t seen results to back<br/>\n&gt; that up yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right now I can hit for up to 22dmg with my Bladed<br/>\n&gt; Thulian Claws and have hit for 23 with my Saeiny&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; claw (in my offhand).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
