An OOC<br/>\n&gt;comment was made as follows: &quot;I never thought I&#39;d read about a exploit<br/>\n&gt;on eqbards and see it being used in-game by a bard on that list&quot;. Three<br/>\n&gt;members of your group replied they were not using any exploit, but you<br/>\n&gt;were, since I am familiar with the exploit, and you WERE using it. How<br/>\n&gt;do I know? I made the OOC comment, I was on another character. I never<br/>\n&gt;sent you any tell, and never said you would be banned, as that is not in<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Were you the ogre or the enchanter? An enchanter sent me the /tell.  How are you so sure I was exploiting?  Our group of 4 noticed the pathing bug but did NOT know/figure out how to exploit.  We DID consider it an annoyance and were running to the mobs to kill them until I found out that I could charm them into following me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;my power to do so.

This has been stated by Karana&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;GM-Lead (Mennix) over server broadcast before, you may ask him how he<br/>\n&gt;feels about people using the cazic temple pathing exploit to verify this<br/>\n&gt;should you feel like it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wouldn&#39;t want you to feel you didn&#39;t have a face for your accuser,<br/>\n&gt;which is me. I don&#39;t know whether you read this list before using the<br/>\n&gt;exploit at the Cazic temple or not, it doesn&#39;t change the fact your<br/>\n&gt;group was using the exploit, and had been doing so for quite awhile<br/>\n&gt;before I commented on it. Had you truely been naive to what you were<br/>\n&gt;doing, I suspect any ooc comment from your group would have been along<br/>\n&gt;the lines of &quot;where?&quot; not &quot;no we aren&#39;t!&quot; as was the case with groups in<br/>\n&gt;other areas of the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like I said, I received a /tell and heard my name in OOC.  I appreciated the warning even though I was completely clueless to any exploits at the time.  I am not upset at what went on.  My main point of this post was to state that I don&#39;t think exploits are appropriate for this list since I DO NOT use them or care to know about them.  I don&#39;t want to drag John into this, but our guild does not cheat/exploit and he would tell you that.  If I had, I would no longer be a member of Platinum Sphere considering the entire group was made up of guild members including our leaders secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry if I sounded rude at the time of the incident or in my original post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Beatdrop Battledrum &lt;Platinum Sphere&gt;<br/>\nChild of Erollisi Marr<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\n--</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
