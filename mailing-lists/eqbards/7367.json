But they also swear their weapons proc more often<br/>\nwhen I play Chant of Battle with a drum (+28 to str and dex if<br/>\nI recall correctly).  One thing is almost definite though - if<br/>\nyou speed up your attacks, the weapon will proc more in a<br/>\ngiven space of time. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLately I&#39;ve been hearing that wisdom affects your chances of<br/>\nbeing charmed.  No idea if that&#39;s true, or just a D&Dism (at<br/>\nleast I think it&#39;s a D&Dism) that&#39;s being mistakenly applied<br/>\nby the players to EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nGZ has mentioned wisdom affects your chance of fizzling a<br/>\nspell.  It seems when GZ made a base 5% chance to fizzle even<br/>\nthe simplest spells, it also changed our missed note rate on<br/>\nthe simplest songs from 0% to 5%.  So if missed notes<br/>\ncorrespond to fizzling spells, perhaps you high level bards<br/>\nexperiencing missed notes while starting the high level songs<br/>\ncan try wearing some wisdom enhancing items, and see if they<br/>\nmake a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
