That being said, if you want to dual wield a lot, put a very fast<br/>\nweapon into your off hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of things to keep in mind:<br/>\n<br/>\nDex only affects proc&#39;ing rates of the main hand weapon<br/>\nMinimum damage (at high levels) only affects the main hand weapon<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, conventional theory at high levels is to put your fastest weapon in the<br/>\nmain hand since you are guaranteed a minimum damage level. The only time to<br/>\nviolate this is if you have a procing weapon that you want to proc a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt lower levels, with no minimum damage, the conventional theory is to put<br/>\nthe faster weapon in the off hand so that you will dual weild more.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Elijah Meeker [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 13, 2000 3:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] 17th Level<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I made 17th level last night and I have a question.

THe next one you will want to dump a lot in is safe<br/>\nfall, and you have some levels to go for that.<br/>\nYou want your fastest weapon in your primary hand and your bigun in your off<br/>\nhand as that gives you the most chances to dual wield. At 25 I am *still*<br/>\nusing a dragoon Dirk and PGT, though it is getting a bit long in the tooth<br/>\n(and mostly now I use all instrument attack)  it is perfect for 17-24. Even<br/>\nif you don&#39;t get a PGT get a dragoon dirk for your primary weapon, even when<br/>\nyou stop using it you can put it in your throwing slot for it&#39;s bonuses, and<br/>\nit&#39;s numbers are actually better than your longsword. Don&#39;t bother with the<br/>\ntenticle whip, though a barbed one would be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMAXIMIZE YOUR CARD, MINIMIZE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
