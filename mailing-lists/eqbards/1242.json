Every so often, an evil eye<br/>\n(or the Lord evil eye) would get pulled near the zone border<br/>\nand charm people before it was killed (the charm lasts despite<br/>\nthe death of the charmer).  These charmed people would then<br/>\nrun around attacking everyone else.  You don&#39;t want to hurt<br/>\nthem because they&#39;re not in control of what they do, but OTOH<br/>\nit can be a pain just standing there soaking up the damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat to do?  I just started up my lullaby and put all the<br/>\ncharmed people to sleep, and everyone else got busy healing<br/>\nthemselves.  (The charmee hitting sit over and over works too,<br/>\nbut in one case the charmed person went linkdead.)  They wake<br/>\nup every now and then and swing at you, but usually go right<br/>\nback to sleep.  Verant in all their wisdom made it much easier<br/>\nfor mobs to stun than for players to do so, so it was actually<br/>\neasier to do this against players than monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s little things like this, doing stuff that nobody else can<br/>\ndo, that really make me like the bard.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
