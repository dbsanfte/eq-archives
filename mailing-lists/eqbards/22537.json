If you can&#39;t find one in your<br/>\nprice range and nobody his hocking Yaks (twilight zone) I&#39;ve got an old<br/>\none dusting in the bank I&#39;d let go for an even 2k.<br/>\n<br/>\nNinev Rudeflute<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, you are 45 and in a level or two you will be able to hit the<br/>\nplanes and pick up a weapon better than anything else you can get for<br/>\naround 2k.
