If they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-131134606\">On the other issue&#39;s part, Get em to fix our danged drum. =) <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as my thoughts on new songs go, I would sacrifice utility for <br/>\ninteresting/coolness. If they can be one in the same, then great, but the <br/>\nthings that will keep me going in this game are my friends and having party <br/>\nmembers and strangers see me do something and say &quot; hot damn thats cool , i <br/>\nwanna start a bard&quot;  <br/>\n - A stronger healing song , bleh ya useful to an extent , but most likely <br/>\nthere will be other people in your group that can do it better. <br/>\n<br/>\n- greater clarity - same as healing , sure its uselful. but i mean , boring. <br/>\nyay we can twist clarity and this song, but where&#39;s the fun. If this was a <br/>\nlvl 60 song, then i would say screw, I can do the same things at 53 - 55 , <br/>\nthat I could at 60, so why bother leveling. <br/>\n<br/>\n- new charm - seeing what the dungeons they have added on since release look <br/>\nlike, Hate , Fear, Sky , Kedge - these are all dungeons that are &quot;done&quot;. <br/>\nAside from a few spots in kedge you can&#39;t really just go to a spot with a <br/>\ngroup and camp there. you need mutiple groups, and you go through and &quot;do&quot; <br/>\nthe dungeon. My guess is that most if not all dungeons will be like this in <br/>\nRoK. Hearing about what rooms looked like in some of the dungeons in the <br/>\nexpansion, having 9 or 10 mobs in a single room is quite common. Now, unless <br/>\nour charm gets a set duration over like 20 seconds ( if its even that ) to <br/>\nlike 1 or 2 mins. then it is pretty useless IMO. Unless of course you always <br/>\nhave an enchanter in the group, or 2 full groups. Because otherwise all you <br/>\nhave is a lvl 40+ mob attacking 1 mob, then breaking charm and have 2 or more <br/>\nmobs thwacking on the bard = dead bard in 1/2 sec.  And sure, it may be <br/>\nuseful in outdoor areas somewhat. But think about it, that is a limited <br/>\nscenario.And as it is now I have very little interest in soloing. That isnt <br/>\nvery fun to me. Seeing as we only get 5 - 10 songs in the whole expansion, <br/>\ndoes this really warrant taking up a slot. I don&#39;t think so. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as for constructive song Ideas i have, I guess i don&#39;t right now. I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to be suprised, but I have a feeling I will be let down. Can you tell I <br/>\nam going through one of those EQ ain&#39;t so great phases right now?? hehe. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love my class, but unless the songs we get are really interesting, then i <br/>\nprolly will never bother to level. <br/>\n<br/>\nUlaien Firesong <br/>\nlvl 50 bard of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
