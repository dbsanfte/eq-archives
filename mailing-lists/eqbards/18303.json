Berserker Strength is a lvl 20 spell that repeats the prov of the<br/>\nPGTomahawk (The thing you get in High Hold) with a decrease in agility,<br/>\nincrease<br/>\nin Strength and small Rune affect (And no reagant needed)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone was using a PGT/The Enchanter was casting that on the person<br/>\nbeing<br/>\nhit upon, this could be why it was working inconsistently.
