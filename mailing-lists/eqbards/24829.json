We tried Gone recently and we just don&#39;t have the resists to do<br/>\nher.  I think people in our guild got lazy since we whomping other dragons<br/>\n(Trak, Wuoshi, Serv, Talendor) and never got good resist equipment.  We have<br/>\nbeen working on it for a couple of weeks now and I think we&#39;ll make another<br/>\nrun at Gone soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 55 Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
