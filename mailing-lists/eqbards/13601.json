In the last 6 or so dragon runs <br/>\nnone of our casters have complained about it.  If they are hit by it have <br/>\nthem go LD using /quit and come right back.  Also there is no min on dragon <br/>\nbreath as over the weekend we did both Nag & Vox (other guilds were sloted <br/>\nto do them but they could not take em and yield them to my guild).  And in <br/>\nboth runs I has taking as little as 1/8th a bubble from dragon breaths.  My <br/>\nFR/CR was 220+ in both cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 24 Jan 2000 14:36:33 -0500 (EST)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, now that Dragon Fear strips buffs (cancel magic/pillage enchantment<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whatever), everyone is gonna pile on as many useless buffs as possible - <br/>\n&gt;15,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 20 whatever - exactly what the so-called exploiters were doing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Which does absolutely nothing, as pillage enchantment strips buffs<br/>\n&gt;   seemingly randomly.  My first buff was Illusion: DE yet he stripped<br/>\n&gt;   my Agility and Strength in the first attack (which both were in the<br/>\n&gt;   middle of my buff list).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Our L22 song is the same way.  It took me 4 pulses to remove resist<br/>\n&gt;   fire from myself, and Reso/SoW took 2 or 3.  Things that stripped<br/>\n&gt;   first:  Shaman buffs.  Things that went last:  Resist buffs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   In the wave against Nagafen, I had 170 FR.  And again, I lost<br/>\n&gt;   a full bubble of health, confirmed this time with 2100+ hps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   DragonBreath does one bubble of damage if you are in melee range<br/>\n&gt;   as a minimum (with 2000 hps).  The key here is in melee range, as<br/>\n&gt;   our cleric was hit with AE far back, and took much much less dmg.<br/>\n&gt;   Magic resist in the 200s, and I still got feared once briefly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   The new AE Fear also bugs casters as once they are hit, there is<br/>\n&gt;   a chance they will not be able to cast spells.  (You have not<br/>\n&gt;   recovered... permanently)  With our casters in this state, it<br/>\n&gt;   was pure melee that brought the dragon to the &#39;Lord&#39; in Lord<br/>\n&gt;   Nagafen.  But it was without healing and nuking, umm hehe there&#39;s only<br/>\n&gt;   so much the melee peeps can do.  Too bad the programmers at Verant<br/>\n&gt;   cannot get their stuff straight.  It&#39;s a shame the players have<br/>\n&gt;   to pay for their constant mistakes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
