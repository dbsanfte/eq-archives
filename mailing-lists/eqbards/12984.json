Now this soon adds up and when I have to waste time<br/>\nrunning across 6 zones to my corpse I&#39;m gonna be pissed. Aswell as having<br/>\nto mem songs and spend an hour getting back the exp I lost. My monthly<br/>\nphone bill is roughly ´┐¢100-120, in $ I would probably say it is about<br/>\n$150-175 per month.
