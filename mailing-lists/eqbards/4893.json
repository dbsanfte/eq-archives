The AI is much better than any game<br/>\nthat I have played.  Yes there are places where you can trap NPC&#39;s and kill<br/>\nthem (exploits).  Yes trains are a problem, but is that because of poor AI?<br/>\nNo thats from poor players.  To me its very realistic to go in a dungeon,<br/>\nget overwhelmed and have to run for my life, with everything else coming<br/>\nbehind to tear me to pieces.  The first time I saw really good AI is when I<br/>\ntook out my bow at level 7 to hit a gnoll to bring it to me.  Instead of<br/>\ncharging though, it did the same thing!  And continued to until I got into<br/>\nmelee range (where it brought out its long sword and started meleeing).<br/>\nYou don&#39;t think healing in battle is smart AI?  Healing other NPC&#39;s?<br/>\nStanding back and casting spells until you come in range?    I was in Paw<br/>\nthe other night soloing the Captain.   Everytime I got it down to half<br/>\nhealth it would heal itself (I thought to myself when did the captain start<br/>\ncasting spells?)  Well finally I turned around and noticed a gnoll shaman<br/>\nhealing him the whole time!  (should pay attention to the text more).  It<br/>\nleft me alone until I came after it - it was content to just stand there and<br/>\nheal the captain because I was more powerful.  The AI in EQ is pretty damn<br/>\ngood - the terrain features are what gives the NPCs problems  (have to agree<br/>\non the quest parser though!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tRoop Dirump[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, August 04, 1999 3:36 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [eqbards] Bard Petition<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Roop Dirump&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I think there&#39;s quite a bit of balance in the classes.  Well,<br/>\n&gt; individually.  I think magic users are much more powerful than melee<br/>\n&gt; types,<br/>\n&gt; if there&#39;s any imblalance it is in this manner.  It&#39;s all design I<br/>\n&gt; suppose,<br/>\n&gt; but I always felt the battlefield should be for the warriors, while the<br/>\n&gt; mages stayed back home in their towers (casting spells fropm there!) or<br/>\n&gt; perhaps stood on hills overlooking the battles.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In EverQuest the mages are very hardy, and exremely powerful--in this<br/>\n&gt; world<br/>\n&gt; the mages are the true masters of the battlefield, and the warriors are<br/>\n&gt; theoir helpers.  For my tastes, a mage should be a little old man or<br/>\n&gt; woman,<br/>\n&gt; complete weakling, easily slaughtered with a gigantic axe...  That is if<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; could get close to them.  Of course, how could they ever survive in<br/>\n&gt; Everquest?  So mages can survive battlefields, but they still have all the<br/>\n&gt; good without the bad (or not enough of it).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally, if I could see anything changed in this game.... it would be<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; AI!  The parser NPCs use for the quests is technologically backward.  The<br/>\n&gt; original Zork games had a more complex parser, and these games are twenty<br/>\n&gt; years old!!  In fact, EQ really doesn&#39;t parse for a damn.  It is highly<br/>\n&gt; simplistic for a game so recent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But that&#39;s not the worse of it.  You know, one can always tell how poor a<br/>\n&gt; game&#39;s AI is by looking at how the game is designed.  In the first<br/>\n&gt; Civilization, the AI was given a chance against the player by letting the<br/>\n&gt; computer cheat.  In Alpha Centauri, the computer does not cheat at all!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The AI in EverQuest is so poor, the NPCs cheat blatantly.  Camping is not<br/>\n&gt; something people do just for items.  People camp everywhere!   Groups<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; roam around together, fighting as they go!  They camp, and send out scouts<br/>\n&gt; to pull.  The AI is very dumb and can be tricked this way.  I have never<br/>\n&gt; played a game where trains are a way of life, never even played a game<br/>\n&gt; where<br/>\n&gt; Train becomes part of the vocabulary, and I think it&#39;s a problem.  All<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; stems from poor MOB AI.  If anything needs tweaked, it&#39;s not the PCs but<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; NPCs!!!  It inspired me to write a poem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanna be an npc<br/>\n&gt; But not some stupid orc<br/>\n&gt; I wanna be an npc<br/>\n&gt; And be a piece o work<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanna backstab with me fists and feet<br/>\n&gt; Dirk don&#39;t need it see<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d know and cast and memorize every spell there is<br/>\n&gt; Mana don&#39;t need it see<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d cast and fight and kill with ease<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d be a magic monk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanna know just everything<br/>\n&gt; But a bard would be too hard<br/>\n&gt; See those aren&#39;t good at everything<br/>\n&gt; Npcs are never bards!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanna chase you to the zone so far<br/>\n&gt; And laugh at all you cowards<br/>\n&gt; I wanna chase you if you come to close<br/>\n&gt; And make you camp in corners<br/>\n&gt; Hah ha ha Hah ha ha<br/>\n&gt; I would not be pulled you see<br/>\n&gt; Npcs are are fools you see<br/>\n&gt; But I would be too smart<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanna cheat like the computer<br/>\n&gt; And get stuck in a corner<br/>\n&gt; I wanna cheat like the computer<br/>\n&gt; In a group I&#39;d be a horror<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Roop<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
