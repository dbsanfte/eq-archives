(tho this may have changed.  there are only a couple bards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;left in the guild at dragon/god level.  there used to be enough to put a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bard in every group.)  because of the guild rules this would only happen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;us if we joined pickup groups at frenzied, with no guildmates that could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;*cough* use it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it&#39;s a moot point for me now anyway.  i left the guild.  i never really<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thought it&#39;d happen.  these are my friends, not people to help me gather<br/>\n&gt; &gt;loot.  leaving over this issue would&#39;ve been foolish.  but it was pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt;clear in the discussion that too many in the guild think we should make<br/>\n&gt; &gt;useful chars instead and only dig out the bards at large targets, where<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we&#39;re actually useful.  and what a god-awful burden it was getting us<br/>\n&gt; bards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;up to dragon/god level to begin with, why don&#39;t we shut up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but they&#39;re still my friends, so i won&#39;t say the guild&#39;s name :P<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 17 Apr 2000 08:07:42 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: ugh, shutting bards out of lotto getting more widespread<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; get a new guild<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; find out up front what the loot rules are - before you join<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; tbh, bards at high levels dont need haste items.  on really big stuff, you<br/>\n&gt; do not want to be a melee person.  you will contribute best to your team<br/>\n&gt; with your songs enhanced by your instruments. but you do need to feed<br/>\n&gt; yourself on a day to day basis and you will still spend your time outside<br/>\n&gt; guild events swinging swords so you do have a legitimate use for haste<br/>\n&gt; items.  so, if your guild was saying that the up front melee people need<br/>\n&gt; haste items first, i would agree with them.  then your problem is that in<br/>\n&gt; such a large guild, there will always be someone in front of you.<br/>\n&gt;  although,<br/>\n&gt; you should be able to field a group to go camp for a sash in guk.  but<br/>\n&gt; taking you out of the lotto entirely is pretty bad.  i&#39;d be looking for a<br/>\n&gt; new guild (although i&#39;d never have joined or stayed in such a large one<br/>\n&gt; anyways.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jeff Heskett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tarkin@...\">tarkin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 13, 2000 10:08 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] ugh, shutting bards out of lotto getting more<br/>\nwidespread<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tonight i found out that no longer will bards in our guild be allowed on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lotto for haste items, ever.

At first I<br/>\n&gt; thought Cannibalism to be inefficient, but after discovering this I found<br/>\n&gt; timing the stand -&gt; cast -&gt; sit pattern between ticks, I could use both<br/>\n&gt; effectively (med and cann).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe clarity (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus) puts a &quot;clarity counter&quot; on<br/>\n&gt; everyone in the group.  When the tick occurs, the counter is removed and<br/>\n&gt; additional mana is granted to the holder.  This would explain why it is<br/>\n&gt; possible to weave one other song in addition to clarity without diluting<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s effectiveness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was thinking about this topic because I don&#39;t like the common ideology<br/>\n&gt; of &quot;direct mana addition per pulse,&quot; when starting/stopping the song<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t add anything over simply singing it straight (despite the doubled<br/>\n&gt; number of pulses).

Have any of you tried Lament on<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Imp or Lava guardians or been the puller for the Efreeti raid?  If Lament<br/>\n&gt; would work, I really think that a single well balanced party of 6 might be<br/>\n&gt; able to handle the break in alone.... :)  If none of you have tried it, I<br/>\n&gt; think I might go for it next weekend...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, 2 Efreeti in the first 3 spawns and then we were shut out with only<br/>\n&gt; place holders for the next 10 hours...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Taneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 48th song<br/>\n&gt; Prexus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 17 Apr 2000 10:26:35 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Lord Grim: aLive and Undead in South Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly spent the weekend camping Lord Grimrot.  Ugh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why bother?  Well, old Grimmy drops stuff that you need for the Aegis of<br/>\n&gt; Life, a Clr & Ppal only, AC 12, +10 wis +25 sv Disease, 1 charge Superior<br/>\n&gt; Heal.  And it can be equipped in your back slot making this a very<br/>\n&gt; desirable cloak - heh.  The Grimmer is a long spawn (maybe 3 or 4 times in<br/>\n&gt; real time 24 hours for the live version and my guess is once per 24 for<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; dead version.) You need his scythe (common) and his heart (uncommon.)  He<br/>\n&gt; drops 2 scythes, both lore, one is no drop.  He spawns in 2 versions: live<br/>\n&gt; lev 35-39 highly magic resistant human SK or lev 25 undead skel form.<br/>\n&gt;  Sometimes you get 1 live, sometimes 1 undead, sometimes 1 live and 1<br/>\n&gt; undead at the same time, sometimes 2 lives, and of course sometimes 2<br/>\nlives<br/>\n&gt; and 1 undead.  And he has a large agro range.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For 49 levels, I saw this guy maybe 2 times - ran past him to zone on the<br/>\n&gt; stone bridge after he bashed me good.  Now in the past month, I have been<br/>\n&gt; in nearly 10 Grim kills.  Solo&#39;d him one time when I met him on the bridge<br/>\n&gt; - he was at half health and I nearly died and I was 48 or higher.  The<br/>\nrest<br/>\n&gt; of the kills have been with at least a co-level of higher cleric.  At 50<br/>\n&gt; both me and the cleric, get knocked to about half health before he dies.<br/>\n&gt;  He is a meanie!  The undead version is lots weaker.  One time, I had<br/>\n&gt; Ghanex Drah charmed and was killing skellies when the undead Grim spawned.<br/>\n&gt;  Heh, my pet died but so did Grim.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And now for the kicker, you need insanely high faction to complete the<br/>\n&gt; quest.  Like highest of all the highs.  It&#39;s pretty funny to see my DE<br/>\n&gt; Cleric friends turning in bones, gold, rabid pelts, etc etc to get their<br/>\n&gt; factions up but somehow they manage.  Heh, what is this dark elf doing in<br/>\n&gt; the Temple Of Life talking to clerics and paladins?!?!?  Rumor has it,<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; has been changed on test server and the faction it takes will be high but<br/>\n&gt; not as high as it is now.  And then there will be a flood of campers???<br/>\nWho<br/>\n&gt; knows.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyhow, my high elf Clr friend got her shield this weekend and my DE Clr<br/>\n&gt; got his parts and is finishing his faction.  And a 3rd just needs a<br/>\nscythe.<br/>\n&gt; And we met a couple more who are in the process.  When I dinged 40 and the<br/>\n&gt; last blue avo turned green, I thought that was the end of my long hours in<br/>\n&gt; South Karana - heh guess not.  Got to see the Pegasus 2 times over the<br/>\n&gt; weekend for the first time ever.  No sight of GrizzleKnot nor Coloth<br/>\n&gt; Meadowgreen (who I owe a couple deaths to.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; &lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bardette of 50 songs<br/>\n&gt; ... somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s. took off work on Friday so I could stay up all Thursday night in the<br/>\n&gt; new Hateville.

That is prime xp territory. I love to get guild<br/>\n&gt; groups there. Where will you go at 48,49, & 50?  For 45, 46, 47,and to 50<br/>\n&gt; even, I killed alot of spectres - mostly solo (I&#39;d say 80-90% of my 45 was<br/>\n&gt; &#39;solo&#39; - ie ungrouped helpers at times buffing & healing but one heck of<br/>\n&gt; alot of fear/chaining.)  Until 47, single pulls are hard unless the spots<br/>\n&gt; are heavily camped.  Oasis, Feerott & OOT are the prime spectre spots.<br/>\n&gt; Soloing them is a possibility at 45 but risky.  With a partner, should be<br/>\n&gt; quite easy.  Another partner spot is Cyndreela outside the TV in the PoF<br/>\n&gt; cave (but that is like guard camping except you fight a caster instead of<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; melee class. Kill, heal/med, rinse, repeat.)  Other wise, outside<br/>\n&gt; Permafrost<br/>\n&gt; Ice Giants,  OOT seafury cyclops, rathe mts hg&#39;s, Lower Guk King Room,<br/>\n&gt; Ghoul<br/>\n&gt; Lord Room, Frenzied.

This is basically what happened.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Day 1: Cleared Fairies and Azaracks, camped on Gorgalask<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Day 2: Cleared Gorgalask and Pegasus, camped on Pegasus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Day 3: Recleared Pegasus, realized it was already 11PM, did some poking<br/>\n&gt; around on Spirocs and jumped off, leaving a necro and cleric on pegasus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some spoilers for how we handled pegasus/griffons below, as well as some<br/>\n&gt; basic info on spirocs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of Griffons and Pegasus, Griffons are noticibly easier.  Both of them<br/>\n&gt; split into two sub 55 red cons&#39;s (tested w/ Bard Charm) which, when<br/>\n&gt; killed, each spawn another &gt; 55 cons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The method we use to kill them is fairly simple.  1 group consisting of 2<br/>\n&gt; warriors, 2 clerics, and 2 enchanters, and 4 melee/cleric groups, with<br/>\n&gt; pure casters not really helping except with pets.  That 1 group is known<br/>\n&gt; as the &quot;mez group&quot;.  We kill the first one, and when it splits into 2,<br/>\n&gt; everyone attacks the same target except for the mez group.  The 2 warriors<br/>\n&gt; from the mez group attack the other target, tanking it while the clerics<br/>\n&gt; heal and the enchanters chain cast rune 3.  The bards keep trying to charm<br/>\n&gt; the first split to give the mez group 18 second breathers.  Meanwhile,<br/>\n&gt; everyone else kills the other one and the subsequent triggered spawn.<br/>\n&gt; Finally, everyone kills the remaining spawn that the mez group has been<br/>\n&gt; tanking the whole time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keeper of Souls (the boss) is on par with Innoruuk in difficulty, so not<br/>\n&gt; too bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Spirocs.  All I will say about spirocs is you don&#39;t have to combat drop<br/>\n&gt; in.  It&#39;s perfectly safe to run around most of the island.  The agro range<br/>\n&gt; on the spirocs is like 0.1 ft, with the exception of The Spiroc Guardian<br/>\n&gt; and The Spiroc Lord.  Despite them consing scowls, they don&#39;t generally<br/>\n&gt; attack unless you run right up to a roost.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We got a ton of drops, just nothing for clerics or bards :(.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Miriana<br/>\n&gt; Legions of Darkness<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
