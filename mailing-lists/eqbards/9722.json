She is really a lot of fun but I<br/>\nhave a few questions.  First of all....what is the stats that bards<br/>\nneed to work on...(cha?  dex?  str?) I have concentrated on those 3<br/>\nthings and with ALL my stuff on my cha is 133 and my str is 99...not<br/>\nsure my dex...please can someone advise me on that.  Next is that I<br/>\njust got my lvl 8 song and I remember reading that it was such a useful<br/>\nspell once..when i first got on the list and my bard was like lvl 3 and<br/>\ni had no idea what anyone was talking about.  I have looked through<br/>\nsome archives but there is SOO much stuff...its difficult to locate. <br/>\nPlease can someone help me out here...between playing my druid in the<br/>\nmain I am really beginning to enjoy my bard if I can understand the<br/>\nsongs and use them to their full extent.  Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\nChisarra <br/>\nbard of the 8th season</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
