They apparently have a belt of something or<br/>\n&gt;another that gives them Spirit of Norrath. The guide you<br/>\n&gt;saw running around wasn&#39;t using Selo&#39;s or a drum..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well this is wrong from first hand experiance. After the first zone crash<br/>\nin the Plane of Fear (full spawn eeek!) we had a guide helping us by<br/>\nressurecting and recovering our corpses for us. He would summon us to our<br/>\ncorpse in the PoF and then do a ressurection. I thought this was damn odd,<br/>\nbecause he was a lvl 50 cleric guide and was using his lvl 49 spell to do<br/>\nthis. And he had to meditate after each time. I have been ressurected<br/>\nbefore by our GM and he didnt med or cast, just zapped away. Maybe this was<br/>\njust a freak occurance, i dont know, but he definately had his spells :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 50 bard<br/>\nEnoch Lyciferous, lvl 40 Necromancer<br/>\nTunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
