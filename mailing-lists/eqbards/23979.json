It&#39;s not the only reason present and it&#39;s <br/>\nhard to say if it&#39;s the most common reason or not.  Many Hate/Fear <br/>\nraids, for example, ask that everyone goes Anon/RP so they don&#39;t get <br/>\nraid crashers. i.e. People would do a /w all 50 55 and if a lot of <br/>\npeople showed up in Hate, then they&#39;d know it was safe to port up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, btw, that 74 count on Xegony more than likely missed me, since I <br/>\nusually play during primetime and have been on Roleplay since they <br/>\nintroduced the ability.
