I would very much<br/>\n&gt; like to obtain a Guise of the Deceiver.  Wait, don&#39;t flame me yet I know<br/>\n&gt; its<br/>\n&gt; No Drop.  I would be willing to accompany a party to Lower Guk if they are<br/>\n&gt; going there anyhow and pay for the right to loot one off the assassin.<br/>\n&gt; From<br/>\n&gt; what I understand there are groups hunting him for his rare drop, whatever<br/>\n&gt; that is, that already have one for everyone in their party.  I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; been<br/>\n&gt; able to find anyone like this on E&#39;ci but my higher level contacts are<br/>\n&gt; limited.  If anyone is going there and would be interested in minorly<br/>\n&gt; twinking my poor little bard please let me know.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are several quests I&#39;d like to explore and this is the only way I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; get the chance short of retiring my bard for about 6 months to build up an<br/>\n&gt; evil character.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thank you for your time in this blatant request for aid and assistance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; \tLookin&#39; to darken his horizons<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
