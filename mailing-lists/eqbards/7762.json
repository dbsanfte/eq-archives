Get ready to<br/>\ndie before me!&quot;<br/>\nReverse-kited (Screech-Chains) him until he was almost dead (I was only half<br/>\na bubble of hps down from full), so I decided to stop and melee him down.<br/>\nBig mistake.  Luckily I drunkenly changed tactics back to reverse-kite and<br/>\nbeat him while still having a bubble of hp left.<br/>\nDid I say I love Screech?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\n27 on The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
