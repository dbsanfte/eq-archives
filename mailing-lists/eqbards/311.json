If running away while flinging axes,daggers or stars is<br/>\nokay then songs/spells should be no different.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the most-used method of avoiding certain death by monsters (Zoning)<br/>\nsounds like the biggest exploit to me (by their standards) yet is allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Ian Murphy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zigmo@...\">zigmo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been reading the messages about kiting but I have never done it. As of<br/>\n&gt;yet, I don&#39;t really have strong enough songs to perform it effectively.<br/>\n&gt;My question is: why is it an exploit? Certain songs/spells have a ranged or<br/>\n&gt;radius effect. What if I&#39;m out singing (don&#39;t have a lute or mandolin yet)<br/>\n&gt;the Chords of Discord (hurts my throat) and killing beasties. While looting<br/>\n&gt;a corpse I&#39;m set upon by a beastie that I feel is too tough for me. I begin<br/>\n&gt;to run from it. Getting lost, I run around in circles reading messages that<br/>\n&gt;the beastie winces and I occasionally take damage. Let&#39;s say that I<br/>\n&gt;accidentally kill the beastie before it kills me.<br/>\n&gt;Have I exploited a bug or not? I was running away the entire time. Is it my<br/>\n&gt;fault that the beastie is so enraged it will follow me to the ends of<br/>\n&gt;Norrath (or the nearest zone wall)? If this is exploiting a bug, what is<br/>\n&gt;the bug? Is the bug the fact that I have a song that can damage beasties at<br/>\n&gt;range or that I can run as fast or faster than some or that beasties chase<br/>\n&gt;you?<br/>\n&gt;What if I had a missle weapon and was singing Selo&#39;s Accelerando. Running<br/>\n&gt;backwards, I am faster than some beasties. By throwing daggers or axes at<br/>\n&gt;them I stay out of range and they take damage. Taking damage they will<br/>\n&gt;continue to follow me in which case, I will continue to lob whatever I can<br/>\n&gt;at them. Is this exploiting a bug? It seems like the same situation, but is<br/>\n&gt;now OK.<br/>\n&gt;I am confused and a little scared. Who decides where the fine line between<br/>\n&gt;clever and exploitation is? I fear to try new things only to discover that<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve &#39;cheated&#39; and will now be banned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Journeyman Plastos<br/>\n&gt;still wearing the sandals </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
