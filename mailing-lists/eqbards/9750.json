I thought I posted<br/>\nthe test results on Dodge  that I did to the list, but will see if I still<br/>\nhave them at home.  Basically increases in agility showed definite increases<br/>\nin successful Dodges up to 101, after that the rate of obvious change slowed<br/>\nfrom 5 point breaks to 10-20 point breaks.  I only tested from 70 - 145<br/>\nagility values as that was the range I had access to at the time.  The tests<br/>\non Parry and riposte were not helpful to us but showed similar tendencies.<br/>\nThere was overall a 30% difference between 101 and 70 agility in successful<br/>\ndodges as I recall from memory.  145 showed only a further increase of 15%<br/>\nover 101.  There was a point in there where the agility multiplier for ac<br/>\nwent up significantly after 101, but it was fairly high, 131 I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chris Musson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...\">oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 09, 1999 1:53 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: AC Dilemma<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Chris Musson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...\">oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as getting the lambent components, I try to group with people higher<br/>\nlvl<br/>\nthan me (as i can still be useful for buffing and minor melee damage) if<br/>\nthey<br/>\nhave an opening.

The only effect that agility has, based<br/>\non<br/>\nthe tests i have seen, is a minor increase in AC (1 AC for every 5 AGI<br/>\nroughly,<br/>\nthough there are breakpoints [notably, agi 74 to agi 75] where it can do<br/>\nmore) <br/>\nThere have been rumors that Agility effects dodge, parry, riposte, etc, but<br/>\nI<br/>\nhave never seen any hard evidence of this.  Based on the evidence I have<br/>\nseen,<br/>\nthe Elf Hide gloves could just as easily say: AC 5, +5 Dex (while this is<br/>\nbetter than Snakeskin, it may or may not be worth the associated cost...I do<br/>\nnot have a single plat that i can throw away, so the Elf Hide are just not<br/>\nworth it.).
