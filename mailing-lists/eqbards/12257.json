On the other hand I completed my fourth shaman<br/>\npiece last week with my 21st level bard, and I did all the required killing<br/>\nmyself for 3 of the pieces.  I&#39;ve also done 3 crafted quests, including the<br/>\nslaying required, and 1 ranger piece.  I&#39;m halfway thru about 5 bard pieces.<br/>\nIf you think our quests are easy try some of the others, they make ours look<br/>\nmany levels off for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had no luck getting the icy greaves despite trying four times now.<br/>\nI&#39;ve spent about 6 hours in the king room with no luck.  I know others have<br/>\nbeen more fortunate on this note, but since the critters involved are still<br/>\nfar beyond my means for almost all the bard quests, while the critters for<br/>\nsome of the other classes&#39; quests are not, I don&#39;t believe ours are as weak<br/>\nas people seem to think.  Our quests are relatively easy for the level<br/>\nVerant seems to think should be doing the quests (30-35).  Other classes can<br/>\nget some pieces 10 levels before this easily although some of their pieces<br/>\nmay be fairly difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dave Gaines [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 30, 1999 6:40 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] I feel a nerf a coming...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmit it, the bard quests are much too easy.
