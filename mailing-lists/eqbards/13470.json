The poster theorized that the following will<br/>\nstart happening:<br/>\n<br/>\n46+ level characters generally have more money than they know what to do<br/>\nwith.  Because PoA is a big money sink, this cash reserve will eventually<br/>\nget low and possibly run out.  As a result, 46+ characters will have to go<br/>\nback to lower level areas and camp high value items that they don&#39;t need in<br/>\norder to sell them for cash so they can get back into PoA.  This will have<br/>\ntwo likely side effects.  First, lower level characters who don&#39;t have the<br/>\nhigh value item will have problems because they will have to compete with<br/>\n46+ level characters for the spawn point.  Second effect is that now it will<br/>\nbecome easier to buy these items for cash.  Prior to the patch (when<br/>\nplatinum was plentiful), most people would only trade a high value item for<br/>\nanother high value item that they could use.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, this could turn out to be an unexpected side benefit from the PoA.  A<br/>\nlot of people, myself included, are not inclined or don&#39;t have the time<br/>\nrequired to camp for high value items.  As a result, it was difficult for<br/>\nthose type of players to obtain the item on their own or to purchase it from<br/>\nsomeone.  It now appears that this option may soon become a viable<br/>\nalternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   I&#39;m reluctant to pay 230p to get in and 700p to buy keys<br/>\n&gt;   to cross what appears to be the desert of Ro in the air, just to meet<br/>\n&gt;   up with some f&#39;ing imp who can kill me by triple attacking in the 190s<br/>\n&gt;   in less than 2 seconds.
