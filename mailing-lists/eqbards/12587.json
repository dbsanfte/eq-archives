I have a lvl 50 necro on Veeshan. <br/>\nUnfortunatly Veeshan is owned by FoH so dragon runes are not a possibility. <br/>\nBoth dragons are either Gm slain within 10 mins of server coming up or FoH <br/>\nhas a group or 18-24 people posted outside the FG and ICE giant area making <br/>\nfinal preps for going in. Only rarely does FoH miss an oppertunity to kill <br/>\nthe dragons or a god. That&#39;s why I started my bard twink heh. Not much to do <br/>\nwwith my necr. BTW off topic, but what are some good lvling areas for a <br/>\nsemi-twinked (still wanna learn to play the class as intended) lvl 8 bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nKlayan Deathbringer (The Oracle) lvl 50 Necro<br/>\nCelantra (The Oracle) lvl 8 semi-twink Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Nagafen 2; Sylly 0<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 5 Jan 2000 17:23:55 -0500 (EST)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never said or felt that you were an idiot, but I have noticed in <br/>\n&gt;recent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weeks that your attitude toward other players whos level hasn&#39;t caused <br/>\n&gt;them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a nosebleed (under 49 apparently) has deteriorated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Only on dragon raids and plane trips, you&#39;ll notice.  I cannot stress<br/>\n&gt;   waiting on dragon raids.  Cause there ain&#39;t nothing else left after you<br/>\n&gt;   do them.  Make the level, and then kick back on dragons.  Otherwise,<br/>\n&gt;   you aren&#39;t gonna get anything else out of the game.  I&#39;m having great<br/>\n&gt;   fun doing dragon planning and raiding planes.  After you make L50,<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ve realized that the strain of making levels is lifted, and you can<br/>\n&gt;   enjoy the game much more.  Again, that&#39;s my take on it as people<br/>\n&gt;   often like to disagree with me.  But there is no excitement after<br/>\n&gt;   you&#39;ve done it all, in my opinion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
