The were only 2 bards on the raid of 47 people<br/>\nincluding me and the other bard, Strattos, had most of his imbrued already.<br/>\nStrattos was very cool and gave me lots of pointers when I got up there, not<br/>\nsure if you are on this list Strattos but if so, thanks for all your help!<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was a great night, both Maestro and Inny were up and Maestro was dual<br/>\nwielding 6-note blades.  We failed in our first attempt on Maestro but we<br/>\nreorganized and took him down with few deaths on try number 2.   The battle<br/>\nagainst Innoruk went faster than Maestro with few deaths and we took him<br/>\ndown on the first try.  I ended up getting a Six Note Blade and Imbrued legs<br/>\nwith only one death but was not in a group that was getting any XP,<br/>\nnonetheless it was great fun.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe thing that I thought was the coolest was that 8 individual groups of<br/>\npeople went up there and worked together without bickering over items and<br/>\nXP, I&#39;ve been playing EQ for over a year and a half and this is truly a<br/>\nright of passage for me.  Thanks to everyone on this list for all the great<br/>\nadvice over the months that has helped me to be the best bard I can be<br/>\nwithin the limitations of Verant&#39;s world.<br/>\n <br/>\n-Faras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n50 Bard, E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
