I always thought I wouldn&#39;t get insulted but I did.  I<br/>\ntold him that he had to be kidding, it&#39;s going to take longer to kill the<br/>\nmobs and you will be healing more.  He was the only caster in the group, so<br/>\nI choose to buff the melee people.  After a couple minutes of arguing about<br/>\nit (he found out I was right) he said, &quot;got to log, bye&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mana song is a blessing and a curse.
