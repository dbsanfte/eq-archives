We could have really<br/>\nused the Clinging Darkness line to slow stuff down so that it couldn&#39;t run<br/>\nwhile our pets beat on it.  Not being able to call off the enchanter pets<br/>\nmade them knock things out of root too much.  We found that those darkness<br/>\nDoT&#39;s stick just fine once a mob&#39;s tashan&#39;d and really help out.  Having the<br/>\nmage was good, I was thinking pre pet change as well actually, still haven&#39;t<br/>\nreally adjusted to that yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Wayne Sheppard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 04, 2000 8:29 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] RE: RE: Harmonic&#39;s Super Rant Session (OT, very long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Thu, 3 Feb 2000 16:12:37 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: RE: Harmonic&#39;s Super Rant Session (OT, very long)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d love to hear the results!  But ooh the downtime!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was part of an all caster group of six that ventured into the new Paw.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; had 2 enchanters, a shaman, a cleric, a mage, and a wizard.  It was boring<br/>\n&gt; kinda.  We either annihilated the mobs we faced or got forced to gate real<br/>\n&gt; quick.  With 3 pets we were able to get away every time though.  If we&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; have had 2 necros and just 1 enchanter and no mage I think it would have<br/>\n&gt; been even easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just curious as to why you didn&#39;t want a mage?  Necro pets were better<br/>\nbefore the weapon delay adjustment, but now I think mages are just as good,<br/>\nif not better.  Necros are very mana effecient, but can&#39;t unload on<br/>\nsomething fast like a mage can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of the all melee group, we went the other way.  We have 4 mages,<br/>\nenchanter and a wizard, all gnomes on VZ around level 11-13.  With 5 pets<br/>\nand blasting power from everyone, we take things down very fast.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink a necro&#39;s DOT would get halfway done before everything was dead.  With<br/>\nplenty of summoned bandages, everyone has a good Bind Wound skill.<br/>\nWe can bandage up anyone to half health in 10 seconds or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nValentine&#39;s Day Shopping Made Simple. <br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine7\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine7</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
