I have several<br/>\nquestions that I&#39;m hoping some more experienced bards may be able to<br/>\nanswer...<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I&#39;ve seen a few instrument parts for sale.  Is there a trade skill for<br/>\nbuilding instruments?  How is this done?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Does it make any difference what instrument you use within a category?<br/>\n I bought a Mandolin rather than a Lute because it weighs less.  I got a<br/>\nMinotaur Horn right off the head of one of the filthy beasts, and I&#39;ve been<br/>\nusing that for a wind instrument rather than buying one.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Can anyone tell me what &quot;Enthrall & Nix S.&quot; means?  That&#39;s all the<br/>\ndescription the Strategy Guide gives for the 15th level bard song.  I have<br/>\ntried to figure it out in game, and all I&#39;ve succeeded in is getting myself<br/>\nkilled.  It seems to be an area effect that makes every NPC in the area<br/>\ndecide to attack me if I&#39;m solo, and I haven&#39;t spotted any effect when<br/>\nturning it on in the middle of a big melee. (Does it bother anyone else<br/>\nthat the game doesn&#39;t provide spell descriptions? It makes me really mad.<br/>\nThere is no in-character justification for this; the senior-level NPC bards<br/>\nwho teach the songs should tell you what they do!)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Any information on the &quot;stuck song bug&quot; and how to cope with or prevent<br/>\nit?  I had only experienced this twice before last night.  Last night we<br/>\nkilled a named Gnoll and I got a magic axe that casts Berserker Strength,<br/>\nand with that equipped I started getting &quot;stuck&quot; songs every couple of<br/>\nfights.  (Seems to get stuck when the Berserker Strength spell kicks in<br/>\nwhile I&#39;m switching songs, or something like that.)  The &quot;stuck song bug&quot;<br/>\nsymptoms are that you aren&#39;t singing (all song buttons are visible) but it<br/>\nshows a song icon active and gives messages as if you were singing that<br/>\nsong. You can click this icon to get rid of it but it comes back again a<br/>\nmoment later. Any song that you try to sing ends immediately. It&#39;s like<br/>\npart of the program thinks you&#39;re still singing the song, but another part<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t, so you can&#39;t stop. The only ways I&#39;ve found to cure it are to log<br/>\nout or zone. It sometimes goes away by itself eventually (might be when I&#39;m<br/>\nstunned by a monster, not sure).<br/>\n<br/>\n5) I haven&#39;t found the level 14 (Identify) or 19 (Invisibility) songs yet.<br/>\nI thought they were in High Pass, but we got there last night and found<br/>\nonly a few songs for sale. (They did have the level 16 water-breathing<br/>\nsong, which is GREAT.) They aren&#39;t at the Kelethin, Freeport, or Qeynos<br/>\nbard guilds, and I haven&#39;t heard of any other city with a bard guild. Has<br/>\nanyone found these? (I won&#39;t be level 19 for a while yet, but I&#39;m still<br/>\ncraving the song.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.!<br/>\nLive Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns!<br/>\nAccessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!!<br/>\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
