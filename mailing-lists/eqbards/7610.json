Unless there are any major<br/>\ncomplaints, I&#39;ll fire this off to GZ before I leave work today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 44 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>\ngame.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.  If<br/>\nthey are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests) please<br/>\nat least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to<br/>\nget them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste our time<br/>\nquesting for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to have no<br/>\neffect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many bards.  It<br/>\ndoes not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it should) nor does<br/>\nit protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please confirm whether<br/>\nthis song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>\nlooks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>\npatch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>\nregularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>\nexpect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>\nequipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>\nwrists.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) There seems to be an absense of any mid to high level bard quests.  Is<br/>\nthere any implementation planned for these?  When might we expect them?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Spellcasters, when they right click on a spell can see what skill the<br/>\nspell uses.  Why doesn&#39;t the bard spell book show what instrument skill is<br/>\nrequired when you right click on a song?<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Some of our skills (Hiding, Forage) cap at such low levels, that they<br/>\naren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of these, but if the caps<br/>\nwere raised such that at least they worked more than<br/>\n1 out of 20 times, we might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) It has been the case (since release) that playing Selo&#39;s when in an<br/>\noutdoor zone, would &#39;break&#39; the effects of the root spell.  With a recent<br/>\npatch, this is no longer the case.  Was it a bug that it broke root<br/>\noriginally, or is it a bug that now it doesn&#39;t?  When could we expect a fix<br/>\nfor this if it is a bug?<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Our instument skills cap at 200.  After level 40, our songs get more<br/>\ndifficult to play, but our skills do not increase to match.  This can result<br/>\nin 15-20 missed notes from high level songs in one battle.  Why do our<br/>\nskills cap at such a level that our high level songs become difficult to<br/>\nplay, let alone stack?  This doesn&#39;t seem to make sense, as casters magic<br/>\nskills (evokation, conjuration, etc.) cap at 250 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
