I was able to affectively keep 2 mobs busy and never got below <br/>\n\thalf health the entire time.<br/>\n-------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own experience, this begins to change as you start fighting bigger and<br/>\nbigger mobs.  I was in Old Sebilis near the pyramid last night without an<br/>\nenchanter, and I was doing crowd control for my group.  If there was a two<br/>\npull, I would charm one as long as I could  (every now and then a lvl 52<br/>\nfrog would get pulled).  If there was a three pull or four pull (only<br/>\nhappenned once), I kept them all locked down with pixie strike (made 53<br/>\nwhile I was there).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with keeping two mobs occupied with charm in the &quot;post-50&quot; world<br/>\nis that the mobs hit so hard that when charm breaks, you cant last long<br/>\nagainst two mobs beating on you at once, much less actually be able to sing<br/>\ngetting pounded on so severely.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite thing yesterday while my pet froggie shaman was fighting a<br/>\nnecrosis scarab (we did not have a shaman in our party) --  &quot;A necrosis<br/>\nscarab yawns&quot;.  Nothing like having a pet shaman doing the slowing for you<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon of Bertox<br/>\nLvl 53 (?)Minstrel(?)<br/>\nGuild Leader, Defenders of Aleria</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
