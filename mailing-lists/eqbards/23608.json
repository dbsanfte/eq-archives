I was intent<br/>\n&gt;on making 46 and decided to solo for a while since group exp in DL is<br/>\n&gt;comparatively slow.  I was chain-charming things and my last thrall was a<br/>\n&gt;SoW&#39;d Drachnid Widow which was at half health from it&#39;s last fight.  I<br/>\n&gt;pulled it to the Karnors east wall and weaved my way through the pillars,<br/>\n&gt;chanting, chaining and Selo&#39;s-ing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;She got a few big double hits on me which made me wince, but I thought I<br/>\n&gt;could handle it.  Then, horror of all horrors, she rooted me and moved in<br/>\n&gt;for the kill.  At first I tried to charm her, but she kept stunning me.  All<br/>\n&gt;of a sudden I&#39;m down to less than a bubble of health and the realisation<br/>\n&gt;that my last couple of hours work was all for nothing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I gave up on charm and started mashing Pixie Strike.  It landed.  I quickly<br/>\n&gt;swapped my tambourine for lute and twisted in Hymn.  Another burst of Pixie<br/>\n&gt;Strike and she remained mesmerised.  I kept this going for 5 or 6 pulses of<br/>\n&gt;Pixie Strike until the roots fell from my feet and I thought &quot;screw this&quot;<br/>\n&gt;and made for the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And here&#39;s a /rude to the 49 SK from Prophecy who stood by and watched the<br/>\n&gt;whole time. :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I swear, when I zoned into FV, my hands were clammy and shaking.  It&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt;a game, right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pixie Strike is one song I&#39;ll never do without - Enchanter or no.
