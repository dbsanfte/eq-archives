A little checking and I found that the bear<br/>\nand wolf meat can be turned into sandwiches with combining the meat with<br/>\nbread (weight .6, I usually can buy it for 1sp3cp) and these sandwiches<br/>\n(weight 0.1) can be sold to shopkeepers for around 3sp or to players for<br/>\naround 5sp.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, it takes patience and you don&#39;t get the megacash return that people<br/>\nseem to think that a skill requires, but I&#39;ve found that people just love<br/>\nbaked goods as you can carry alot more baked items for the same weight of<br/>\nstore bought items.  And sandwiches are easy, you max your baking skill<br/>\non them at 30 at which point you can go on to making steaks (about the<br/>\nonly thing I can find to do with lion meat currently) which seems to be<br/>\nthe next step up in baking.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I have a spit to go along with my large sewing kit, I&#39;ve found<br/>\nthat I can make a tidy profit off of all the wolves, lions, and bears<br/>\nthat roam by the orc camps in EC as well as the occasional weapon and<br/>\narmor off of the orcs that wander by (I don&#39;t bother with the<br/>\ncamps--usually too many people around them and I&#39;m frequently soloing,<br/>\nanyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp,<br/>\n<br/>\nGrei of Bristlebane<br/>\n13th Measure<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nReality is nothing but the search to escape from it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
