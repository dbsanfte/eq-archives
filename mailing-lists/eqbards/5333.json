Any advice on how best to group with a cleric, wizard, and<br/>\n&gt;warrior?  I&#39;m at level 5 now and will probably join the wizard right away.<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be joined by the warrior or cleric until level 8 or so<br/>\n&gt;though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Evulia of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;and Kingbird of Brell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your mage friend will love jig for the mana replenishing aspects it<br/>\nhas...twist it with chant of battle til you get hymn of restoration. Chords<br/>\nare nice but dangerous as can attract too muuch attention! When you hit 8<br/>\nand join with your warrior friend try chant/ lament or chant/ lament / hymn<br/>\nif you can get 3 up.. just an old timers views on low lvl songs.  Once you<br/>\nhit 10 anthem replaces chant in your arsenal..12 ad a bellow to the lineup<br/>\nas an alternative....Selo is of course an ALWAYS memmed song for those tight<br/>\nspots! Good luck to you..we will be rooting for you!<br/>\n<br/>\nElyana Silvanae<br/>\nBardesss of the 35th Chorus<br/>\nAmbassador to the Ridgerunners<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
