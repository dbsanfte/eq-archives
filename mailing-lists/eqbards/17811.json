I worked out a<br/>\nworst-case scenario explaining the song to my guild and was a<br/>\nbit puzzled when a 100% resist rate (reapplication of the song<br/>\nevery 3 seconds) would take 8 minutes to deplete all my mana.  <br/>\n(Putting aside for the moment any arguments about whether we<br/>\nshould even be using mana.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;                    That was to be expected but Selo&#39;s Accelandro and Selo&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; Song of Travel both got capped at 66% haste now...which is SLOWER than Spirit <br/>\n&gt; of Scale. Actually its not that much or a nerf and more of an insult heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure the 75%/65% listed for us is without a drum.  <br/>\nFrom what I recall of the last spdata.eff parse, all our song<br/>\neffects seemed to be listed sans instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;                    The Druid and Shaman resistance spells (Circle of Summer, <br/>\n&gt; Circle of Winter etc) all got raised to increase resist by 45 instead of 40<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Brings it in line with the high end enchanter MR buff.
