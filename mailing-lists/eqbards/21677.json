I admit I was surprised <br/>\nrecently when I found all 3 of them chained. I was trying to find the board <br/>\nwhere someone posted that all 3 couldn&#39;t move. All jail hunters I know on <br/>\nBertox already knew this and were blasting away at the cornered mobs. As a <br/>\nmatter of fact, 1 warrior who I was teamed with wanted me to ensure that 2 <br/>\nmelee mobs were left before I left, so that he could just fight the 1 spawn <br/>\nin the cell by himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t stopped by there recently, let me know when was the last time you <br/>\nwere through there and what server you were on, maybe that makes the <br/>\ndifference?<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:30 PM 10/5/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Stuff in the cells are chained?  They sure didn&#39;t have any trouble chasing<br/>\n&gt;me halfway to the zone before I outran them.
