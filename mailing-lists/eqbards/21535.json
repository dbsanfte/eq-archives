I&#39;m level 39 now, and was<br/>\n&gt; cruising through Oasis <br/>\n&gt; and on a whim, ran out to spectre island.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, specs are great and I believe will take you up to<br/>\n49th if you don&#39;t mind slower and slower progress. <br/>\nHGs are even better (money/xp) but on my server rathe<br/>\nmtns have swelled to 56 which is too much.  Zone can<br/>\nhandle 26 with 2 bards or 34 with 1 or 2 bards.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Tambourine in hand, and weaving Aria of Eagles and<br/>\n&gt; Accelerando, I targeted <br/>\n&gt; one of the spectres sitting on the corner. I kept a<br/>\n&gt; good distance and hit <br/>\n&gt; it with Chant of Flame.  I backed off to the shore<br/>\n&gt; and waited over in the <br/>\n&gt; plains by the &quot;shelf&quot; near Sro zone. I watched as my<br/>\n&gt; target came out of the <br/>\n&gt; water I started to kite him with the 2 chants. I<br/>\n&gt; then noticed 2 of his <br/>\n&gt; buddies coming over a ridge. Fortunately, they<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t above level 37, so I <br/>\n&gt; charmed the one I was fighting, and sent him against<br/>\n&gt; his buddies.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, think charm kite.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I happily observed that both of the newcomers<br/>\n&gt; started beating on my pet, so <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t have to worry about being chased. I kept on<br/>\n&gt; eye out for the <br/>\n&gt; healthy one and charmed him when I noticed my pet<br/>\n&gt; was getting beat up <br/>\n&gt; pretty well. No problem, 2 died pretty quickly, and<br/>\n&gt; I was left with just <br/>\n&gt; kiting the last one who was at full health thanks to<br/>\n&gt; his lifetaps.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t actually ever noticed an increase from the<br/>\nlife taps though that would follow logically.  God<br/>\nknows I get hurt from it.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kiting is pretty easy as they are slower than<br/>\n&gt; molasses. I observed that if <br/>\n&gt; I keep away from them, I hardly got lifetapped. When<br/>\n&gt; he was below a bubble <br/>\n&gt; of health he started to run. Unfortunately, he<br/>\n&gt; started running just as he <br/>\n&gt; was out of my view. I looked around for him, but he<br/>\n&gt; had disappeared and <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t even show up on track. Evidently, he warped<br/>\n&gt; back to the island. As <br/>\n&gt; soon as I went near the island all the spectres<br/>\n&gt; aggro&#39;d on me. I zoned as I <br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t ready to tackle 5.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, unfortunatly that does happen at it TOTALLY<br/>\nsucks. I found out the hard way that they occationally<br/>\njump back to their spawn point.  Also, they don&#39;t<br/>\nalways warp to their spawn point, but sometimes go<br/>\ninto the water.  Best thing to do it run straight to<br/>\nthe edge of the water and look for scythe.  If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t see it, get ready to deal with 5 :P  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, tackling 5 isn&#39;t exactly as tough as it sounds. <br/>\nThe only difference is you need to weave selos and<br/>\nhymm inbetween charms.  I would get life typed 3 times<br/>\nas I turn too close only to have it regened in 30 to<br/>\n40 seconds in between charms.  Also, kite with a<br/>\nmandolin in hand rather than a drum.  This is the<br/>\nbiggest reason why you&#39;ll get tapped more but I think<br/>\nit&#39;s the only thing that keeps me alive.  Tried it<br/>\ngoing straight drum and pulled out the mandolin when I<br/>\ngot down to a bubble.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe 2 biggest problems with kiting specs is 1 they<br/>\ndon&#39;t always refollow commands after charm.  Most of<br/>\nthe time they do but sometimes they don&#39;t.  I can<br/>\nalways get xp from 4 of the 5 but seldom all 5.  The<br/>\n2nd is, once you clear all 5, people will move in and<br/>\nstart contesting the spawns.  I&#39;ve had this happen a<br/>\nlot even to go so far as have people start repeatedly<br/>\nKSing me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I went back and hunted them again. I chained them<br/>\n&gt; when they ran. If I was <br/>\n&gt; kiting just 1, I chained him instead of using<br/>\n&gt; accelerando. Also, I noticed <br/>\n&gt; that the closer I was to the spectre, the less<br/>\n&gt; likely he was to resist my <br/>\n&gt; chants. I tested this about two dozen times, but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sure John Kim would <br/>\n&gt; disapprove of my sample size. I&#39;ll be hunting them<br/>\n&gt; more, so I&#39;ll keep an <br/>\n&gt; eye on that correlation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>:P The chants I have do seem to get resisted a lot. <br/>\nNever bothered to test it but that would make sense. <br/>\nOn a side note, one thing intresting I noticed today<br/>\nis my cleric seemed to med faster as the group got<br/>\nlarger though I could be wrong.  I wouldn&#39;t put it<br/>\npast Verant to mess with med times in order to force<br/>\npeople to group.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; SOW would have been helpful, but it&#39;s not necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>SOOOOO agree here.  I&#39;ve screwed up the weave many<br/>\ntimes and got negatively reinforced to the tune of 260<br/>\npoints of damage.  Hehe, Electric Shock Therapy has<br/>\nnothing on that!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Lastly, I posted that I thought I saw less of a<br/>\n&gt; wobble to our accelerando. <br/>\n&gt; Well with a nice view of myself (instead of in a<br/>\n&gt; dark swamp) I <br/>\n&gt; unfortunately see that I still spasm my way across<br/>\n&gt; the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Windleaf Mistsong<br/>\n&gt; Clan Battlehammer<br/>\n&gt; Level 39 Balladeer<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Centiera begins spasming<br/>\nCentiera moves faster<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, I don&#39;t know what I will end up doing<br/>\nwith my bard.  If I wanna keep my friends, I have to<br/>\nplay the bard.  And soloing which I have to do to<br/>\ncatch them is proving quite profitable (I&#39;ve made<br/>\nroughly 4400 plat off of HGs and specs in 5 days) so<br/>\nplaying her for a bit longer sounds good to me.  Great<br/>\nmoney and xp but it&#39;s boring and SOOO annoying.  I<br/>\njust hate having to fight with people for spawns =(  I<br/>\ndo get some enjoyment though out of telling people off<br/>\nwhen they call me the &quot;greedy bard&quot;.  I clear lots and<br/>\nlots of greens (average is 9 to 11 per 2 HGs) and am<br/>\nusually the one spawning HGs for other people, yet I&#39;m<br/>\nthe greedy one. /rude  Hehe, last time I cam close to<br/>\ndieing was because I had a train of 2 basalisks, 4<br/>\nlizardmen and 2 HGs and one of the lizards bashed me<br/>\nat the wrong time.<br/>\n<br/>\nCentiera D&#39;Winter<br/>\n44th Half-Elf Bard<br/>\nLitharia<br/>\n21st High Elf Cleric<br/>\nVershena<br/>\n14th Erudite Magician<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
