I told him &#39;danger is my business&#39; and he laffs and we chat some.  A<br/>\ncouple times in the conversation he axes me if I am a &quot;paying customer.&quot;  At<br/>\n$10/month I hardly call that paying but I finally tell him yes.  And then he<br/>\ngoes ok if you are a paying customer - here take this mino axe and use it -<br/>\ndon&#39;t go off and sell it.  I like to think that was Aradune in one of his<br/>\n&#39;anonymous&#39; chars.  I kept that mino axe long after I got my combine.<br/>\nEventually, I bestowed the mino axe as a prize to a newbie in West Freeport<br/>\nthat I managed to cajole into /shout ing a dumb joke to the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 13th level<br/>\na.k.a.
