From a fellow Veeshan bard...<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh, and I was excited to ding 53 and get Song of Twilight :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWas on a failed Vox raid this week and got so fed up with the munchkins (the<br/>\nreally bad players seem to have made it to lvl 50 now) that I decided to go<br/>\nand lvl to 53 so I would never deal with crap like that again...<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I immediatly get an invite to Fear (thus no xp) and spend the<br/>\nnexty 8 hours clearing it.  We even got to kill the enraged? golem (the<br/>\nthing that the broken golem spawns).  Got my tendril and an imbrued bracer<br/>\n(from a cube).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I managed to get enough time at Dog Capt on Saturday to hit 53 :) (sigh<br/>\nI leave 52 with neither scale and without Selo&#39;s Drums)<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 53 Veeshan<br/>\n(once again the free range bard for hire)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
