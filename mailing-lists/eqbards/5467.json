He was red to me. The other<br/>\nogres in the camp seem to be in the low 20s at the<br/>\nmost. They were blue to me at lvl 26 when I first<br/>\nforayed into that area. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the reason I&#39;ve heard that these ogres cons <br/>\namiable is that they have some kind of buff cast<br/>\non them benevolence or alliance or the shaman <br/>\nequivalent of those spells and that&#39;s why they cons<br/>\namiable.
