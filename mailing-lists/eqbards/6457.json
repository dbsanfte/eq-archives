The exact wording is &quot;that it will now work<br/>\nbetter&quot;.  Can anyone confirm if it is now working the way it did before the<br/>\nprevious patch or if it now has a higher success rate?   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also mention that a bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed and that<br/>\nspells will now affect more monsters.  I guess its possible that our songs are<br/>\nincluded in this also.  Sure hope this doesn&#39;t mean even more problems with the<br/>\nz-axis bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nSyvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria has been fixed.  I&#39;m only 22d level so am not aware<br/>\nof what the problem was.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot bard related but a topic of interest is that Lore items in containers that<br/>\nare dropped should not be destroyed anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci (Back after a two week vacation and still at 22d level due to<br/>\nnumerous deaths)<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were some pretty good topics discussed while I was away.  It took me<br/>\nalmost all day at work to read through all the digests.  Didn&#39;t get a lick of<br/>\nwork done:-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
