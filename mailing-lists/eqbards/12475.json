It&#39;s about the only way to protect yourself and <br/>\npotentially get a chance at justice. When I was around L20, we set out to <br/>\ncamp the BBC for the warriors in the guild. This was quite a challenge for <br/>\nus as most were inexperienced at dungeon tactics and the levels involved. So <br/>\nwe camped most of the day and along comes a guy who trains us all dead 4 <br/>\ntimes in a row so he can take the BBC. He promptly auctions it right there <br/>\nin the zone while we are waiting for help to get back to our bodies. I <br/>\nremembered his name til many months and levels later, he joins a group I and <br/>\none of my warrior friends are in in L Guk. I promptly disbanded and walked, <br/>\nthe warrior right behind me. Frantic casters /tell us and we explain: we <br/>\nwill never group with this person knowingly. He has no honor and can not be <br/>\ntrusted. Word gets around about people and that makes it harder and harder <br/>\nfor them to find groups. One of our guild officers maintains a website for <br/>\njust this purpose, list of bad and good people as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony server<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
