I was in Lesser Fay<br/>\n&gt; last nite hunting for Crookstinger last nite, blast his elusive hide, when<br/>\n&gt; all of a sudden a passing cleric started healing me.  I thanked him and<br/>\n&gt; told<br/>\n&gt; him he could save his mana as I was able to play a healing song that kept<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; in good shape.  He sais he had no idea bards could heal themselves???<br/>\n&gt; Anyways we ended up teaming up for a bit of bandit bashing while we waited<br/>\n&gt; for Crookstinger to show his ugly mug.  He finally did, but still no<br/>\n&gt; dagger.<br/>\n&gt; the cleric told me it was real nice not to have to blow all his mana after<br/>\n&gt; one lousy bandit cause he knew I could heal him of 100 pts before the next<br/>\n&gt; one showed up.  I didnt have the heart to tell him that was without my<br/>\n&gt; mandolin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now I have another name from the depths of Lesser Fay to add to my book of<br/>\n&gt; grudges.  Some brownie named Bracken Underbrush, a high level druid,<br/>\n&gt; ambushed me as I headed back from the wood elf outpost to Greater Faydark.<br/>\n&gt; With SOW he was able to stay in range for some stunning spells and a lot<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; stings and blasts.  Ouch, where the heck did this guy come from anyway?<br/>\n&gt; Have the brownies taken to wandering at the bandits behest?  He assaulted<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; again on that hallowed hill but I was able to pop up a drum and race to<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; zone.  He totally ignored the other 3 on the hill despite them being lower<br/>\n&gt; level and my never having killed a single brownie, faerie, pixie, or other<br/>\n&gt; diminutive humanoid.  Some day Bracken, some day...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;                   Kitasi<br/>\n&gt;      The mournful bard of Faydwer on E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;       &quot;and no one shall work for money, <br/>\n&gt;        and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>\n&gt;      &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>\n&gt;         and each to his separate star...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
