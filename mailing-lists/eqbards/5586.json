However, be<br/>\nprepared to run a lot, and don&#39;t let some Shaman or Druid talk you into<br/>\ndepending on SoW.  In fact, inform your group that you will likely be<br/>\ntoasting their SoW in the event of a &quot;ZONE!&quot; call.  And you will run.  A<br/>\nlot.  But if you have a good cohesive group that will run when told to run<br/>\n(why don&#39;t people understand that?!) you will survive a lot longer and do<br/>\nmuch better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my best &quot;I&#39;m not dead yet!&quot; story out in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron the last<br/>\ntime I went there.<br/>\nI was helping do a corpse retrieval in the Cauldron.  The corpse belonged<br/>\nto an 11th level guy who was still in Greater Faydark, and not yet a member<br/>\nof the party (which at this point consisted just of me and a 20th +<br/>\npaladin). We Selo&#39;d to the young ranger, brought him back to Dagnor&#39;s and<br/>\ntold him to stay in the NPC camp.  He followed us, a tidal lord attacked<br/>\nus, the Paladin had to LoH on himself to survive it, finally the Ranger<br/>\nlearned to stay at the NPC camp. Finally, I located the body, and<br/>\ntriangulated it to being somewhere in the water.  Pretty well out there,<br/>\ntoo. We swam out to it and I started arguing with the group leader to just<br/>\nhave the corpse owner consent me so I could drag the corpse out of the<br/>\nwater (&quot;No, consent me!&quot; &quot;You&#39;re not the Bard - I can outrun anything, AND<br/>\nI can find the corpse!!!&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t care. Consent me&quot; &quot;Fine. Consent you.&quot;),<br/>\nwhen suddenly an undertow skeleton starts hitting on me, guess it thought I<br/>\nwas cute, in my orange duds.  Not waiting to discuss dinner plans, I<br/>\nstarted running it towards shore (I&#39;m not stupid - fight on solid ground,<br/>\nmuch smarter!)  Silly party leader stays behind with corpse.  THEN a Goblin<br/>\nbosun crashes the party, so the party leader&#39;s dealing with the Skeleton<br/>\n(which was a heavy blue to me but really green to him - he was at least<br/>\n20th) and leaving me to deal with the yellow bosun.  Nice. Real nice.  I<br/>\ndropped in no time, but as I dropped, I was singing the Hymn.  O miracle<br/>\nworking Hymn, how I adore thee...<br/>\nFor some reason, the Bosun stopped attacking me, backed off, and started<br/>\nusing my corpse for a target dummy.  It went like this:<br/>\n&quot;You are knocked unconcious!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;You are bleeding to death!&quot; (Hymn pulses)<br/>\n&quot;You regain conciousness!&quot; (&quot;I&#39;m not dead yet!&quot;)<br/>\n&quot;A Goblin Bosun hits you for 5!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;You are knocked unconcious!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;You are bleeding to death!&quot; (Hymn pulses)<br/>\n&quot;You regain conciousness!&quot; (&quot;I feel fine!&quot;)<br/>\n&quot;A Goblin Bosun hits you for 7!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;You are knocked unconcious!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;You are bleeding to death!&quot; (Hymn pulses)<br/>\n&quot;You regain conciousness!&quot; (I think I&#39;ll go for a walk now...&quot;)<br/>\n&quot;A Goblin Bosun hits you for 4!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the while, I was slowly trying the death crawl to the NPC&#39;s who hang<br/>\nout at that little camp there.  I made it, was knocked unconcious in the<br/>\nmiddle of them, and watched as they took out the Bosun for me.<br/>\nIn the meantime, the Ranger (who had been shouting &quot;Don&#39;t let Talies die!<br/>\nDon&#39;t let Talies die!&quot;) got to his corpse (still in the water!) and looted<br/>\nwhat the Paladin hadn&#39;t already taken.  The paladin didn&#39;t even know how to<br/>\n/corpse it out of the water, and had taken almost half his health in<br/>\ndrowning damage while looting!!!  Gah!<br/>\nI finally caught on to what was up when the Paladin asked me to Selo&#39;s them<br/>\nboth to Unrest and heal them before they went in.  I never thought I&#39;d ever<br/>\nhave a use for the phrase, but I guess it&#39;s in the EQ Glossary for a reason:<br/>\nSugardaddy was babysitting his twinkie.<br/>\n*sigh*<br/>\nAnyway - at least I (miraculously) escaped death that time.<br/>\n(Of course, I died 7 times that night, guess that was to make up for it....)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n&lt;The Wandering Minstrels&gt;<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
