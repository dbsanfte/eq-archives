At level 40, a shaman can outbuff Celerity + Chant,<br/>\n&gt; using mostly L16-24 buffs.

In the above case, the shaman<br/>\nhas a +20 dex spell at L24 that costs 40 mana. By L36 40 mana is a<br/>\nbarely noticable drop in the mana bar and it&#39;s unlikely the shaman is<br/>\ngoing to need to cast it on more than a couple of people in the party<br/>\nwho really benefit from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
