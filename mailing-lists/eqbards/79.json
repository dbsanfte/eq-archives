I&#39;m Thrush of Freeport in the Veeshan aspect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find anomalies and frustrations in our chosen way of magic and seek<br/>\ninstruction from those more learned than myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that when I play the drum those watching see me as if I were<br/>\nstrumming a flute and rather than the drum I hear the sweet sounds of<br/>\nstrings.  Perhaps some perverse enchanter has cast a twisted illusion upon<br/>\nus.  Does anyone know if perchance the great powers of magic may some day<br/>\nset this straight?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another topic, recently I attained the 7th circle of skill and after<br/>\nsaving and even sacrificing a bit of personal jewelery was able to purchase<br/>\nthe scroll for the Whistling Warsong of the 7th circle.  Imagine my dismay<br/>\nwhen what I thought was newfound power had less effect though concentrated<br/>\non me than the old 1st circle song with which we all start has on me and<br/>\nall others in my adventuring group.  Can anyone encourage me that perhaps<br/>\nsome day my investment in the new song will be of some value?<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, I find the Jig o&#39; Vigor to be of no use.  Have I missed some good<br/>\nand valued application?<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to hearing from you.  May sweet harmony accompany your path<br/>\nand Erolissi fill your life with love.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
