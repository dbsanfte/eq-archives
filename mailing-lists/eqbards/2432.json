A shield weighs roughly<br/>\n10 lbs for the small races, +2.5(dirk)-10(screaming mace) lbs for your<br/>\nweapon. Presently I dual wield a combine long (7.5) and a dirk (2.5) for a<br/>\ntotal of 10#. When you add in the weight of bronze plate, even for a small<br/>\nrace it adds up fast. With 3 backpacks, instruments, 10 food/water, full<br/>\nbronze armor (minus the hideous helm for wood elves), and my weapons, I<br/>\nweigh in at roughly 75#. So going INTO the dungeon I weigh that much. Thank<br/>\ngoodness for strength items and spells. since being overweight has an affect<br/>\non your agility (movement speed slows, greater percentage chance of being<br/>\nstunned) you definitely want to watch your weight if you will be<br/>\nfetching/pulling for your group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
