If I am playing heal and a mob runs through our group<br/>\ngetting pulled to another group, I will get all the Faction +/-&#39;s for that mob being killed. I think this was because in Beta the<br/>\nbards songs affected everyone (grouped or not) within a certain radius. I think this area effect code is still in the game but with<br/>\nan additional check (i.e. in radius + in group) for PC&#39;s but for aggro mobs I think they effectively get &quot;hit&quot; by our songs (thus we<br/>\nget those faction hits for mobs we never touched).

If you&#39;ve ever tried to sneak<br/>\n&gt; up on Chief Goonda in WK, you know that he has a *huge* aggro<br/>\n&gt; radius (basically he charged me when he was about 5 pixels<br/>\n&gt; large on my screen at 1024x768).  So it may be that while a<br/>\n&gt; mob&#39;s initial aggro radius is small, once it has been<br/>\n&gt; activated, the AI may be taking into account all potential<br/>\n&gt; hostiles it sees within a much larger radius.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
