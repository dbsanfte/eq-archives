There are white creatures (small), there are white<br/>\n   creatures (bigger, but are they the same thing?), there are brown<br/>\n   things (small, usually laying down) and brown creatures that are<br/>\n   bigger possibly the same thing but standing up.  Then there is this<br/>\n   doglike creature, much bigger than the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Some figures are laying down (as if dead), some have weapons,<br/>\n   some are dancing, some are running, some are chasing others<br/>\n   while others are being chased.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Back to #13, lots of dead? brown creatures, one of them has <br/>\n   yellow glowing eyes, while the small white creatures appear<br/>\n   to be dancing? around it?  Truly weird.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWant To Be Showered With Kisses?<br/>\nVisit eGroups Valentine Gift Guide<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine9\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine9</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
