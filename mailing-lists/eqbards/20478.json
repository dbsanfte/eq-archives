","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1985311946\">I don&#39;t think all IGs are level 50. I&#39;ve been on several trips to perma and<br/>\nfought the IGs past the king room, and found some of them to be quite<br/>\ncharmable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a trick to it though...<br/>\n<br/>\nIGs (and most uber mobs I think) have some additional protection that normal<br/>\nmobs don&#39;t. In order to cast spells on them (bard songs included) you need<br/>\nto be within melee range. This came about a long time ago because people<br/>\nwere abusing geometry by pulling Vox till she got stuck. Once stuck, the<br/>\ncasters would stand back and nuke with little fear of retribution. Shortly<br/>\nthereafter, the range to cast on mobs of that nature was reduced<br/>\ndrastically. On my last IG raid, our casters were experiencing 90% resists<br/>\nuntil I alerted them to this knowledge, once they moved in closer to cast<br/>\nresists dropped to less than 15%.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:solane@...\">solane@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:solane@...\">solane@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 12, 2000 4:47 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Question for the elder bards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAre ice giants charmable?  I did my first Vox run ever last night, and<br/>\nthe puller failed his FD and brought 5 mobs.  1 Priest of Naggy, 1 IG<br/>\nMagi, 2 regular IGs and a frozen terror, or something like that.  I tried<br/>\nalmost continually, and was not able to stick a single charm on *any* of<br/>\nthem.  My un-buffed CHA is something around 139, my level is 49, and<br/>\ntheir MR could not have been *that* high, as casters lower level than I<br/>\nwere sticking spells fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nOoh, and for anyone who likes reading &quot;I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t happen to me&quot;<br/>\nstories...our very last IG of the five (and a regular IG, too) was down<br/>\nto the &#39;c&#39; in his name, when *poof* he disappeared from the king room,<br/>\nwhere we were fighting.  Not two seconds later, we hear &quot;Cali!&quot;, and our<br/>\nwarrior is gone.  She had just enough time to say &quot;he is under Vox&quot;<br/>\nbefore she died.  I was next, only the IG had moved back towards us, a<br/>\nbit.  In fact, he was stading right over a polar bear trap.  So, I got<br/>\nsummoned, hit once, fell through through the floor, got summoned again,<br/>\nhit again, fell again...you get the picture.  I tried to /q, but it<br/>\nobviously did not work in time, as I came back to Firiona Vie. <br/>\nFortunately, I caught a tele to the mainland and ran all the way back up<br/>\nto Perma, arriving right about the time the GMs summoned my corpse (and<br/>\nall the other people who were trapped in walls and such other weird<br/>\nstuff, down in Vox&#39;s lair).  Needless to say, it will be a *loong* while<br/>\nbefore I try Vox again...<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
