Given a choice, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; prefer a mage, wizard, enchanter, or cleric first.  Shaman is<br/>\n&gt; a close tossup, but they get a ton of buffs that would make me<br/>\n&gt; prefer one over a druid.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Druids work great with Bards.  As we know, bards are the monster magnet.  A<br/>\nsmart druid will put up a damage shield on the bard everytime.  At high<br/>\nlevels you will want a cleric for primary healing, but a druid can function<br/>\nas the backup, plus add many other benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
