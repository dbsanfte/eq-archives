Look what he missed? Most dungeons you&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; to in the game were (hopefully) challenging when you learned thier<br/>\n&gt; secrets and how to stay alive in them. All those cool experiences are<br/>\n&gt; denied him, as everything there is green to him and no challenge unless<br/>\n&gt; you really screw up bad. (which some newb with an ebay 50 would probably<br/>\n&gt; do)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On my old server, Tarrew Marr, one fairly well known Paladin sold his<br/>\n&gt; account at 50, and the new owner is (was anyway) the laughingstock of<br/>\n&gt; the server, at least in the high level circles. (Auar for any of you<br/>\n&gt; current TM players) None of the 50&#39;s I used to hang out with, who are<br/>\n&gt; the people planning the plane breakins and dragon hunts, would invite<br/>\n&gt; this character on one of them on a bet. Unless your friend is amazingly<br/>\n&gt; good at picking up on how to play the game it&#39;s highly unlikely he will<br/>\n&gt; ever get the respect of his peers enough to be invited on expeditions<br/>\n&gt; that actually challenge a L50 character, so he&#39;ll probably soon tire of<br/>\n&gt; camping items in lower guk and sol b, the only places that remotely<br/>\n&gt; offer a challenge to high level players.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not really jealous of him, more just frustrated. I think in part this has to<br/>\ndo with my being stuck in Oasis for the last month trying to score pickup<br/>\ngroups and then doing a &quot;/who friends&quot; and seeing that he&#39;s someplace much<br/>\nmore exciting. On the down side this friend of mine was accepted into a<br/>\nguild within a weeking of buying the account, mainly becuase he knew a lot<br/>\nof the guild officers from when they were UO players, so instead of<br/>\nostracizing him for his lack of knowledge for his class and skills, they&#39;ve<br/>\ntaken him under their wing to help him get up to speed.<br/>\n<br/>\n(snip)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well I hope you find a solid group of friends to play with sometime. As<br/>\n&gt; far as I&#39;m concerned that&#39;s the hardest part of this game, and the part<br/>\n&gt; that is the most rewarding. On both servers I&#39;ve played on, I&#39;ve managed<br/>\n&gt; to find a group of people who play similar hours, advance about the same<br/>\n&gt; speed and can actually play their characters competently that I like as<br/>\n&gt; well, so it can be done. If these people aren&#39;t on, I either solo or<br/>\n&gt; play something else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A guild can also help with this, as long as the guild has some kind of<br/>\n&gt; recruiting standard and doesn&#39;t just take anyone who says &quot;Kewl, can I be<br/>\n&gt; in your guild?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another friend of mine and I were joking about the number of people we had<br/>\nin our friends list that seem to no longer be playing. At one time I had<br/>\nsomething like 35 people who I had grouped with and enjoyed playing with who<br/>\neither no longer ran that character or had given up and left the game. I<br/>\nhave not had much luck with guilds, I&#39;ve belonged to two different ones that<br/>\nhave both disintegrated from infighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway not trying to bring anyone down or feel sorry for myself, just wanted<br/>\nto vent a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn Ablesong<br/>\nMith Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
