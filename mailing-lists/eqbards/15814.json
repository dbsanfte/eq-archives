Most of us don&#39;t like to fight every fight &quot;on<br/>\nthe edge&quot; so clerics and enchanters (and to a lesser extent<br/>\nnukers) make for slightly less optimal but more fun (less<br/>\nstressful) play.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaken to an extreme though, you end up becoming clareless and<br/>\nsloppy.  A group who always relies on a cleric ends up with<br/>\none person taking all the damage.  Suddenly the cleric dies or<br/>\nhas to leave the group, and nobody knows who much taunting you<br/>\nneed to distribute damage.
