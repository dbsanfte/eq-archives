Bards have become the most &#39;group oriented&#39; kiting<br/>\n&gt;enabled class imaginable.

I played a bard because of the tactical flexibility.<br/>\n&gt;There was actually a choice of which songs to use in which circumstances and<br/>\n&gt;at what times.  When was it better to Lullaby, when to Chords?  When was it<br/>\n&gt;better to Anthem, and when Psalm?  Those days have gone by as each and every<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and you really have all those choices still at level 31.  as far as i know, chords,<br/>\nanthem, and psalm, as well as hymn, charm, fear, etc all work just fine.  i&#39;ve<br/>\nnever had the problems with pixie that other bards complain about.  i was a<br/>\nmezzing machine in solb on beetles and ldc&#39;s at level 50ish.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;tactical option is deleted or made unusable.

I&#39;ve given up trying<br/>\n&gt;to Pixie anything, better to just charm it and be &#39;protected&#39; when the spell<br/>\n&gt;goes off.
