I have a Silvery war axe,Barbed whip and Dirk right now also. The PGT has a lower dmg ratio than any<br/>\nof the above mentioned weapons, but I kind of like the dmg barrier it provides for a limited time. My main question is whether or not the dmg barrier and extra strength negate the agility loss when it procs? My agil is base at 110 base and I have not bought mush agil increasing items. Thanks for any suggestions, I&#39;d like to hear what people think on the PGT.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
