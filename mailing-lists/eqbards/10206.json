Because the bard isn t affected","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1672890337\">I highly suspect this is a bug related to the code that prevents bards from<br/>\nbeing affected by any mana regeneration boosters.  Because the bard isn&#39;t<br/>\naffected when another bard&#39;s song pulses it doesn&#39;t detect a stacking<br/>\nproblem because the bard doesn&#39;t have the effect on him.  <br/>\nAnother interesting stacking issue I discovered.  The yaulp proc&#39;d by the<br/>\nscreaming mace stacks with Warsong, but not with Anthem, except: If the<br/>\nScreaming Mace procs before the anthem you get both effects.  If it procs<br/>\nafter Anthem is already up you get the your &quot;spell did not take effect&quot;<br/>\nmessage and the Yaulp does not stick.  I thought that was odd as it was the<br/>\nonly order related stacking I had ever encountered.  <br/>\nThat led me to question some of the apparent Hymn stacking we considered<br/>\nlong ago.  If a bard&#39;s song only checks on the opposing bard for stacking<br/>\nwhich seems to be true, could two bards in the same group stand outside each<br/>\nother&#39;s area of effect but both having and intermediary person inside both<br/>\ntheir areas of effect.  If they did would the person in both areas be healed<br/>\ndoubly?  Something to check.  I know for sure that while I cannot play Hymn<br/>\nif a higher level bard is, if I walk away from his area of effect I can play<br/>\nit even though we are in the same group.  Something for someone with good<br/>\nanalysis techniques like John (tm) to check.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Dark&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dark@...\">dark@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I have no clue about the enchanter clarity stacking with bard&#39;s but I<br/>\ndo know bard&#39;s clarity stack with each other. My main char is a necro and I<br/>\nwas grouped with 3 bards in Sol B doing kobolds andthe impact on my mana<br/>\nregen was astonishing. I didn&#39;t even have to meditate and we were pulling<br/>\njust about non stop. So yes bards clarity does stack.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
