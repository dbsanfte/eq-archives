As a 50th level","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2034237767\">I think we have covered all the bases in this thread.  I also think its one<br/>\nof those threads where both sides of the argument are correct.  As a 50th<br/>\nlevel character, Naeeldar&#39;s opinion is the the #1 problem with EQ is that<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t enough stuff for 50th level players to do.  I agree with him<br/>\n100%.  As a 32d level player, my opinion is that the #1 problem with EQ is<br/>\nthat Verant seems to be neglecting the 46- players.  By this I mean there<br/>\nare a lot of areas in the game that need to be fixed, i.e. more quality<br/>\nquests, new items for medium level characters, bugs, etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line is that if EQ is gonna remain profitable over the next few<br/>\nyears, both areas need to be fixed.  Verant has stated that they have<br/>\nmultiple teams working on different areas (expansion, fixing current game,<br/>\netc).  It just seems to me that all improvements to the game are geared<br/>\ntoward keeping the 46+ players happy (i.e. all the teams really working on<br/>\nthe same thing) and not fixing the stuff broken in the current game.  IMO,<br/>\nfixing whats broken in the current game and adding new content (quality<br/>\nquests) is more appropriate for the long term health of the game.  Now the<br/>\ncounter argument is that if the level 50 players don&#39;t have something to do,<br/>\nthey will cancel their subscription. Here&#39;s my opinion on that.  At some<br/>\npoint in time, I think you just have to say its time to hang up the spurs<br/>\nand move on.  Either you start another character or you move on to another<br/>\ngame.  Like Kitasi said in his post, the programmers will never be able to<br/>\nkeep up with the level 50 players.  The expansion will only be a short term<br/>\nfix.  Assuming EQ2 is several years down the road, fixing the current game<br/>\n(bugs) and adding new content (for everyone level 1-50) is the only viable<br/>\noption from a business perspective IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Actually I think Verant is missing the point there.  They will never be<br/>\n&gt; able<br/>\n&gt; to do enough to keep up with the level 50 players unless they totally<br/>\n&gt; ignore<br/>\n&gt; the lower level players.  The majority of the level 50 players play the<br/>\n&gt; game<br/>\n&gt; far too much for Verant to be able to keep up wit providing them new<br/>\n&gt; stuff.<br/>\n&gt; Although those players play the game more they don&#39;t pay any more than the<br/>\n&gt; lower level players.  I have lost close to 20 guild members just in my<br/>\n&gt; guild<br/>\n&gt; because they were tired of Verant only doing things for level 46+ players.<br/>\n&gt; Eventually at this rate Verant will only have those level 46+ players<br/>\n&gt; left.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually you get to play a new class so not boring. They have to fix<br/>\n&gt; overcrowding with high levels first and their is no reason they should<br/>\n&gt; bother with anything else until that happens otherwise Verant will lose a<br/>\n&gt; good percentage of their customers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
