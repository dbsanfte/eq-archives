I also hold no affilliation to said guild nor <br/>\nhave I met any of it&#39;s members, yet I have found their information <br/>\nand input on this board to be helpfull, fair, and honorable. From <br/>\nwhat I have read in the way of complaints against these brothers and <br/>\nsisters, most are petty and malicious. Personally, if someone <br/>\n&quot;slapped&quot; me I would probably question the provoking party rather <br/>\nthan attacking outright, but that notwithstanding the comments made <br/>\nsound more like a grudge for having lost a battle that the &quot;slapper&quot; <br/>\nprovoked rather than an unbiased evaluation of the guild or it&#39;s <br/>\nmembers.<br/>\n<br/>\nZendarin<br/>\nThe Wandering Minstrel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
