I went<br/>\nto the test server and decided to try something different.  After a few days<br/>\nI had decided that when there real server came out I was going to use my old<br/>\ntrusty bard if nothing else because I could avoid that annoying root.  Then<br/>\nthe  news struck. Variant had restructured the code so root should be able<br/>\nto stick even with accelerando.  I haven&#39;t done any testing with it to know<br/>\nhow effective it is now though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I have a question.  Why do you even bother with the pets.  If they<br/>\ninstigate the attack, take them out.  Don&#39;t bother with the pets, they are a<br/>\nwaste of time.  But thats just my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\nAmazing $14,000 Opportunity.
