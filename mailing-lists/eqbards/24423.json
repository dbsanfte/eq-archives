But hunting seafury cyclops the other day I noticed the &quot;a Seafury Cyclops is chilled to the bone&quot; message wasn&#39;t posting.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurious to see if this was a stealth nerf, I tried it out on a few other mobs...(gnolls and a corrupt guard) and saw the message show just fine...has anyone else run into this?  Are Seafuries imune to cold shields?   <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nTyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
