That<br/>\nwas the point at which I decided to leave the homeland of Kelethin and<br/>\nCrushbone and start exploring.  Lots of stuff out there to fight at that<br/>\nlevel range, both in groups or solo.  I recommend doing the bard mail<br/>\ndelivery quests and explore some on the side.  As long as you don&#39;t run into<br/>\na griffon or giant, you can outrun just about anything you might bump into.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Taluvil, 12th bard<br/>\n&gt; btw, where is a good place to hunt for this level?  I&#39;ll go pretty much<br/>\n&gt; anywhere (in Steamfont now, soloing stuff outside the mino caves, but<br/>\n&gt; grouping within)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
