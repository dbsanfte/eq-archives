(Note:  I HATE THAT -<br/>\neveryone runs, why is WALK default?) The only place I&#39;ve been to so far<br/>\nthat would be a good idea to walk in is kelethin.

I&#39;m just a hair from level 8 and about to<br/>\n&gt;begin hunting in Qeynos Hills.  But I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve got any expertise<br/>\n&gt;to share just yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I do have a question though.  I&#39;ve been travelling with a level 8 halfling<br/>\n&gt;druid friend of mine, and whether singing or not, she outruns me by a long<br/>\n&gt;shot.  At the time we were both stripped of everything (multi-zone trip, so<br/>\n&gt;all posessions went into the bank) and she had not cast any buffs on either<br/>\n&gt;of us.  Are wood elves/bards naturally slower than halflings/druids?  I<br/>\n&gt;spent some time hunting in Mysty (just long enough that I was ready to<br/>\n&gt;attack the guards for killing every mob within an 8 mile radius of the wall<br/>\n&gt;just when I had them down to their last breath!) and noticed that while<br/>\n&gt;running with Accelerado I was still getting passed by others (presumably<br/>\n&gt;using SOW).  Anyone care to shed some light on this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ta<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Get involved.
