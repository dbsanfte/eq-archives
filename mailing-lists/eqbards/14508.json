Nearly every change they put in does<br/>\nnot work the first time.  This would not happen if they test half as much as<br/>\nthey claim to.  Heck 1/10th as much as they claim to.  I&#39;d actually feel<br/>\nbetter if they just said, well we don&#39;t do much testing we don&#39;t have time.<br/>\nWhat really gets my butt burning is that they have the arrogance to lie and<br/>\nsay they do test thoroughly, when it is blazingly apparent upon a single<br/>\nglance that they don&#39;t test hardly anything even the one time it takes to go<br/>\nfire it up.  That&#39;s the inexcusable part.  Not that there are bugs or<br/>\nproblems, but that they can&#39;t bear to be truthful as to why the bugs get<br/>\nonto the live servers in the first place.  If GZ is even remotely accurate<br/>\nwhen he says, &quot;you should see the ones we do catch&quot;, then the ones they do<br/>\ncatch must crash the entire game because they sure can&#39;t seem to notice when<br/>\nchanges they put in just flat out do nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Blitz Krieg [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 04, 2000 3:38 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Archmage Answers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Blitz Krieg&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, here&#39;s how I saw it:<br/>\n<br/>\nI logged in and immediately tested clouding.  After finding out it didn&#39;t<br/>\nwork, I wrote it off to another snafu and still am happy they decided to put<br/>\nthe change in.  This doesn&#39;t mean we WON&#39;T get it.  It just means it&#39;ll be<br/>\nnext patch or the one after.  Big deal.  After a year of playing this game,<br/>\nan improvement like this isn&#39;t going to kill me coming in a week or 2 late.<br/>\nI don&#39;t plan on quitting the game any time soon, so in 4 months from now I<br/>\nwon&#39;t even remember &quot;that week or 2 I &#39;should&#39; have had the see invis<br/>\ncomponent and didn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t imagine being in a job where EVERY thing I did was questioned,<br/>\nanalyzed, reanalyzed, condemned and 2nd guessed at least 140,000 times.<br/>\nWhere you do something you see as positive and a section of people will<br/>\nalways think it sucks.  How many changes went into the patch?  1 or 2 things<br/>\nthey missed for whatever reason doesn&#39;t account for much.  Especially when<br/>\nthey WILL be fixed sooner rather than later.  Shit does happen and I&#39;m glad<br/>\nsomeone (or 170,000 someone&#39;s) isn&#39;t there nitpicking at every move I make.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo compare an ever-evolving game with this large of a player base to a<br/>\nsingle player game isn&#39;t fair.  And I can think of numerous &quot;professionally<br/>\nreleased&quot; pieces of software that are released buggy.  Oftentimes with a<br/>\npatch that does a worse job of explaining any fix if a fix even comes.  I&#39;ll<br/>\nname Windows 98 as a prime example.  I feel Verant is doing as good a job<br/>\nwith what they&#39;re working with as ANY group could.  With them, at least we<br/>\nknow they ARE trying.  They may f*ckup, but they will keep trying.  And one<br/>\nday another game will come out that we&#39;ll all love to play more.  But, they<br/>\nobviously are doing something right, right now, or we all wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nplaying or be so passionate about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I try not to rant.
