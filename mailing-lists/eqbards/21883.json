How many bards above 30 are there in your guilds?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more i play, the less bards i realize there are. When i do a /who all<br/>\nbard in my guild, i count 2 bards at the most, me and a lev 52 (unless<br/>\nthere&#39;s a hidden one somewhere).  How sad is that? do a /who all warrior or<br/>\nany other class in the guild and you&#39;ll see on average 7.  Mind you in a<br/>\nweird way this is to my advantage as whenever i&#39;m planes capable, i wont<br/>\nhave to lotto for imbrued since she&#39;s got a full set, a breath of harmony<br/>\nand a partisan.  But still, i still wish there were more bards around but i<br/>\nthink the numbers will keep dropping as i read this mailing list 8(<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. got my ss helm, in a weird way, im kinda happy the effect doesnt work<br/>\nfor me yet. I cant wait to see myself in imbrued/ss together, i think the<br/>\ngreen and yellow look cool together.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;you have slain an Eye of Minkin&quot;   *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nValorium<br/>\nSol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
