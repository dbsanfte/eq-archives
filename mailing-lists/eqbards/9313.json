","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-253424275\">Yea, &quot;hug that right wall like your life depended on it - cuz it does!&quot;<br/>\nthat was the advice I was given after my first and only train through there<br/>\nlast nite. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings were going real good - seemingly steady stream of blues  - xp was<br/>\ngood enough to ding me into 35.  Then it got slower - duh -- level hell.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so now down to bardic business.  Our crew: 40 enchanter, 40 shadow<br/>\nknight, 36 troll warrior, 41 cleric & your truly the 34 going on 35 bard. We<br/>\nwent to the exec(utioners?) room and camped there.  We also pulled from the<br/>\nsavant room -- someone else was pulling the other two things from there<br/>\n(forget their names.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe froggie knights were no problem and even mulitple pulls were no problem.<br/>\nOur enchanter handled all the crowd control.  My job was anthem, melee some<br/>\n(Staff of Writhing procs DD of 48 non-melee plus hits pretty well on its<br/>\nown), mana song & after combat heals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only real threat were those froggie wizzards who would come in a bit<br/>\nafter the first pulled mob and sit at the edge of the room and play Burn the<br/>\nBard!  Yowzer I was down to under a bub once or twice before our cleric<br/>\nslapped a heal on me.  I had been weaving psalm of warmth with anthem for<br/>\nthe damage shield - love to see them mobs burning them selves when they take<br/>\na whack at us. (FYI - I finally figured out what they mean by damage shield:<br/>\nPsalm of Warmth works like the Ranger/Druid Barbs & Thorns shields - if the<br/>\nmob hits a Psalm  of Warmth shielded player - the mob takes some damage -<br/>\nduh!  You see the message &quot;a mob is burned...&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a couple nasty burn attacks from these wizzies, I went to buffing with<br/>\nguardian and a drum from the time the puller went out to fetch until the<br/>\nenchanter managed to get them all sorted out after the puller and all of the<br/>\nmobs returned.  I guess I should have been stacking guardian and elemental<br/>\nwith the drum. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, my questions are:  how do you know what attacks (fire based or cold<br/>\nbased) mobs are more susceptable to?  Ie, I have heard that its pretty<br/>\nuseless to hit the mobs in Lava storm with fire based attacks. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, does psalm of cooling provide a cold based damage shield? <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
