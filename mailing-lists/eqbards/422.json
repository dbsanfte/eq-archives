I have noticed","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1880460092\">I have a question on twisting songs.  I&#39;m a 8th level bard with a DEX rating<br/>\nof 95 and singing/intrument skills maxed out for my level (45).  I have<br/>\nnoticed when I attempt to twist I miss a lot of notes and as a result don&#39;t<br/>\nreap the full benefits of twisting.  Is the ability to twist songs based on<br/>\nyour DEX rating, your singing skill, or both?  Does the level of the song<br/>\nalso come into play?  For example, as an 8th level bard with a singing skill<br/>\nof 45, at this stage in my career I may not be skilled enough to twist the<br/>\n6th and 8th level songs successfully.  However, down the road when my<br/>\nsinging skill improves to 70 I would have no problem with that combo.  At<br/>\nthat point, twisting the 12th and 13th level songs would give me trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time I use a weapon in combat so should the DEX rating even come<br/>\ninto play since I&#39;m not playing an instrument.  When I created my character,<br/>\nI put points into the standard bard stats such as STR, DEX, and CHR.  I also<br/>\nput a few into AGI to improve my AC.  Should I have put more into DEX than I<br/>\ndid? I enjoy playing with this character and will continue to play them.  I<br/>\nask this question because if I will never be good at twisting due to my DEX<br/>\nrating, I will just play one song at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks ahead for any reply<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
