I fought a cleric deepwater goblin<br/>\n  caster for Kenross ;-) last week.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Brought the goblin to 1/4 health, and crap... I had charm mem&#39;d<br/>\n  instead of pixie... /sigh  Goblin greater heals to 1/2, I beat him<br/>\n  down again to 1/4, he greater heals, I beat him down, etc. etc.<br/>\n <br/>\n  Then I see:<br/>\n<br/>\n  a deepwater goblin begins to cast a spell.<br/>\n  a deepwater goblin feels better.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ??  Hmm... feels better = Light Healing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I mush his face into the ground some more....1/4, 1/8....<br/>\n  come on you dumb thing heal yourself!.... I know you want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You have slain a deepwater goblin.<br/>\n  You gain experience. <br/>\n<br/>\n  uhh, woohoo (green exp!)  lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n  NPCs do _not_ _not_ _not_ have unlimited mana.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They have a whole s-load of it, and it regens very very fast<br/>\n  when they are not in combat.  But once you see a mob spend alot<br/>\n  of mana like this, The force shocks turn into burst of flame, and<br/>\n  the healings turn into light healing.  You know the mob is running<br/>\n  out of mana.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The thing is you have to be much higher than the con of the mob<br/>\n  in order to make it become spent from casting.  I imagine a white<br/>\n  con caster could kill you 2-4 times over with the amount of mana<br/>\n  it has.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
