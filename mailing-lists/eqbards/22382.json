I have<br/>\n&gt; never switched weapons during combat.  I agree with Rokenn <br/>\n&gt; that it&#39;s only<br/>\n&gt; for the most dedicated player.  Maybe it also has to do with <br/>\n&gt; age (I&#39;m 38)<br/>\n&gt; and lack of finger dexterity (I find it enough work to twist 3 songs)!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tAlso - I don&#39;t view leveling as a race.  The fact that <br/>\n&gt; other people level a<br/>\n&gt; lot faster than I do doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tIt&#39;s a game - it&#39;s about having fun.  As Rokenn pointed <br/>\n&gt; out for many of<br/>\n&gt; us - the social aspect is as important or more important than the<br/>\n&gt; accumulation of levels and items (please don&#39;t anyone view <br/>\n&gt; this as a flame -<br/>\n&gt; if that is your playing styles that cool and great - just a matter of<br/>\n&gt; personal taste!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI pretty much ALWAYS twist in combat - and never in <br/>\n&gt; down-time.  In certain<br/>\n&gt; situations I will - but its very much the exception not the <br/>\n&gt; rule.  I need to<br/>\n&gt; do some socializing and rest the fingers!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n&gt; Minstrel of 51 Tours<br/>\n&gt; Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 13, 2000 9:36 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Twisting Questions<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Constant swapping for instruments and weapons is only for the <br/>\n&gt; truely insane.<br/>\n&gt; I may switch back and forth during a battle as is called for, but not<br/>\n&gt; constantly.  You might want to remind your groupmate that EQ <br/>\n&gt; is after all a<br/>\n&gt; social game and it is impossible to be social while twisting <br/>\n&gt; constantly.  If<br/>\n&gt; I am in a group and all is well, I have no problem only <br/>\n&gt; leaving one song<br/>\n&gt; playing so I can chat with my friends, in group, tells, or <br/>\n&gt; guildsay.
