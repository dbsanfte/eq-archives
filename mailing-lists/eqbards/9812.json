From what I have observed, it seems to work similarly to our other<br/>\nsongs.  When the effect goes off the mobs get a chance to resist.  If they<br/>\nfail to resist they nod.  When they would next get to attack they get a<br/>\nchance to break the nod, if they do they attack.  Just as with some other<br/>\nsongs this results in the effect getting broken before it ever costs the MOB<br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI forget offhand what the other songs are that function this way, but I<br/>\nremember John lamenting on the fact that the song could work and be broken<br/>\nbefore it really had any effect.  I have seen it to always interrupt a<br/>\ncaster if they nod though in my experience, but then again I haven&#39;t been to<br/>\nthe Temple of Cazic Thule. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 10, 1999 12:32 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] OMG!

You can pretty much tell when<br/>\neveryone in your group is attacking the same mob by their orientation<br/>\ntowards the mob.  A lot of the time, I get the &quot;head nods&quot; message for all<br/>\nthe mobs but the extra mobs that should be asleep keep attacking.

This is really<br/>\n&gt; aggravating.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s gotten so my groups are saying &quot;That song&#39;s not useful, quit using<br/>\n&gt; it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
