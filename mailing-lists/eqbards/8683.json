I personally dumped 20 or so, when I first got it.  Next,<br/>\nfind yourself a secluded area in any zone anywhere and fire it up.  It takes<br/>\na LONG time for it to go up.  It took me roughly 3 hours to go from 52 skill<br/>\nto 94 skill.  I practice it whenever the opportunity arises... on the boat,<br/>\nwhen people are medding/resting and you&#39;re in a area that&#39;s safe to use it,<br/>\netc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother point, I do _think_ that the skill will go up faster while in<br/>\ncombat.

I&#39;ve read time and again <br/>\n&gt; that I should<br/>\n&gt; venture to Arena or a PvP area, start Denon&#39;s Disruptive <br/>\n&gt; Discord and leave<br/>\n&gt; it running indefinitely to increase my skill.  However, I <br/>\n&gt; have not been<br/>\n&gt; successful in getting that to work.  Initially I went to <br/>\n&gt; Arena in Rathe Mts.<br/>\n&gt; and tried this.  I had read that you only needed to be in the <br/>\n&gt; area, not<br/>\n&gt; actually in the PvP area itself, so I equipped my Minotaur <br/>\n&gt; Horn, fired up,<br/>\n&gt; fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, <br/>\n&gt; fired up, DDD<br/>\n&gt; and went to a restaurant for dinner.  Before I left I noticed that the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;plays horn&quot; graphic wasn&#39;t running, but didn&#39;t think much <br/>\n&gt; about it.  Got<br/>\n&gt; back from dinner to find zero skill increase.  Hmm..  Ok, <br/>\n&gt; perhaps I *do*<br/>\n&gt; have to be in the PvP area, so I tried that.  Same results.  <br/>\n&gt; Ok, maybe it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; the Minotaur Horn - maybe it&#39;s the problem.  So the next time <br/>\n&gt; I was in the<br/>\n&gt; bank and thought about it, I traded out my Minotaur Horn <br/>\n&gt; (tired of the bag<br/>\n&gt; in my wrist anyhow) for a standard store-bought horn.  Last <br/>\n&gt; night I tried<br/>\n&gt; practicing this song in the PvP area of Freeport and it again wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; actually play.  Well now I have gone to Kelethin and bought <br/>\n&gt; Screech and am<br/>\n&gt; completely unable to start the song due to my brass skill.  I <br/>\n&gt; tried to start<br/>\n&gt; Screech (literally) about 300 times last night with and <br/>\n&gt; without the horn<br/>\n&gt; equipped and had *one* success - not too useful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When there is not a mob within range of my song, what I get <br/>\n&gt; is DDD starts, I<br/>\n&gt; briefly get some orange flares from my hands and then it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; just me standing<br/>\n&gt; there.  No playing horn graphic, no orange flares, nothing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can anyone comment on this and/or offer a solution?  I *need* <br/>\n&gt; this song, but<br/>\n&gt; if Verant has changed it so that the only way for me to <br/>\n&gt; increase my Brass<br/>\n&gt; skill is to fight experience-giving mobs with it, I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; screwed.  I *WILL* die<br/>\n&gt; trying to get DDD and/or Screech fired up against a blue mob.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Crier Sharpsong - 26th on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ???
