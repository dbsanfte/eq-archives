It is<br/>\n&gt; a major waste of my wizard&#39;s time to sell these for 10-20pp to people,<br/>\n&gt; when the average HG drops 30pp, why waste 10 minutes moving through zones<br/>\n&gt; trying to sell for only 7-17pp gain, I could just kill another HG.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is also a waste of your time to not sell one, kill a hill<br/>\ngiant, and find another one that you can&#39;t loot because they<br/>\nare lore.  Somewhere therin, there is a balance which is the<br/>\nappropriate selling price.  These things are nowhere near rare<br/>\nenought to warrant 100pp.  My guild is currently chock full of<br/>\nthem.  I&#39;ve already gotten all the lambent stones I need<br/>\n(hint: if you convert them to the appropriate lambent gem<br/>\nstone, you can loot another lambent stone), and I wish people<br/>\nwould just stop asking me if I need any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You have to remember, people that are looting lambent stones are usually<br/>\n&gt; level 30-45, and most of them don&#39;t consider it worth their time<br/>\n&gt; to sell an item to a player for 20pp.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Consider that lambent stones drop at 25x the frequency (my<br/>\nestimate) of black pearls.  Consider that black pearls sell<br/>\nfor 100-200pp.  Consider that black pearls are not no-drop so<br/>\nyou can hoard them until you find a buyer willing to pay a<br/>\nhigh price.  Why on earth would you expect to get an<br/>\nequivalent price for a lambent stone?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
