No<br/>\nproblem, I thought, charm a spare 1 and keep it and its friend busy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo off I go, charm a giant, and set it to attack the other one the<br/>\nrest of the party is hitting.  My new friend is happily bashing the<br/>\nother one until it wears off, and then jumps on me.  So charm it<br/>\nagain, and lo and behold it suddenly starts hitting my party members.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWait a minute, I think!  Stop it, attack the giant.  But no, it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t leave my party alone, and then jumped on me when the charm<br/>\nwore off again.<br/>\n<br/>\nTesting this out a little more .... I&#39;ve been playing around lately in<br/>\nRathe Mountains with my dwarven cleric companion.  He roots them, I<br/>\nchant them to death, it&#39;s great!  Anyway, when we had 2 giants, I<br/>\ncharmed 1 and set it to attack the other.  When charm broke, I<br/>\nrecharmed and it went straight back to hitting the other giant.  No<br/>\nproblem at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody else had any little hiccups with charm?  Is it just a<br/>\nDreadlands thing?  A Kunark thing?  A me thing?  Or don&#39;t they like<br/>\nthe kind of music I play! &lt;sniff&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMelaniel, Wood Elf Bard (41)<br/>\nfinally out of hell and resuming a World Tour<br/>\n<br/>\n... and a host of others<br/>\nMith Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
