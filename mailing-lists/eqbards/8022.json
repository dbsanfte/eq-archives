The clothing they get as newbies COULD be described as sexist and<br/>\nmale chauvenist crap. Why arent newbie men in lion cloths and singlets?<br/>\nAlso, for example, Wood Elf Ranger men look WAY better that Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\nWomen, they look much more like Rangers than their female counterparts.<br/>\nIt seems quite obvious the Dev Team is an all male affair.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKilesha, Level 19 Ranger<br/>\nDiscipia, Level 12 Shaman<br/>\nLycria, Level 10 Bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
