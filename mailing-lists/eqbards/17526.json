Its a great item, but only for classes<br/>\nthat can&#39;t really use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many int casters are willing to trade a lot (Stein of Mogguk is<br/>\ncheaper) of mana for the ac/hp?  As I said maybe necros and mages who<br/>\nsolo a lot (I know my mage wasn;t very concerned with his total mana,<br/>\nsince he had more than enough to cast away anything he could solo).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBards have dual wield before they can afford the item (twinks a side, I<br/>\ngues sit has value to a twink).  And since you can&#39;t hold an instrument<br/>\nwith it, its pretty much worthless to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case we camped the scryer for 4 hours and got two of them (along<br/>\nwith 3/4 braceltes we wanted for our wizard and necro), so I am happy<br/>\nabout their value.  We are going to sell them and use the money to buy<br/>\nthe jewels we need for some class armor for our bard and myself... <br/>\n(since we haven&#39;t gotten much equipment lately)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
