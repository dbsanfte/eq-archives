You are stating the obvious as I said in the past I use it as my <br/>\nwind instrument.

The Crown<br/>\n&gt;of the Frogluk Kings doesn&#39;t say &quot;Effect: Greater Lightstone&quot; either,<br/>\n&gt;and yet when it is worn it&#39;s quite obvious that effect is on it as<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;ve indicated. Checking whether it works as an instrument was simple.<br/>\n&gt;Can it be equipped in melee #2? yes. Does playing Shari&#39;s Sonorous<br/>\n&gt;Clouding with it equipped invis you? yep. There you go, works as a wind<br/>\n&gt;instrument.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ariell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
