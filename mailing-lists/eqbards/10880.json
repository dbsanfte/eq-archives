Sure enough the floor was<br/>\nlittered with the corpses of dead players, but no dead Shin Knight corpses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a patient bard, as well as one that was invis and feeling quite safe,<br/>\nso I sat down and waited for the dreaded trains to come bringing piles of<br/>\nloot.<br/>\n<br/>\n5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes... hmmm no trains.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point I got up and walked down to where the north-south hall<br/>\nstarts.. &quot;Ah a dead froggie!&quot; I loot and get some gold, but nothing else.<br/>\nWhile I am looting another Shin Knight spawns and takes no notice of me<br/>\nwhile I am invis or visible. I tell a friend who is familiar with Guk asking<br/>\nhim if I am indeed in the right spot and if people really do train stuff<br/>\nhere. He confirms on both issues, so I head back to zone border and wait.<br/>\n<br/>\n5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes... hmmm no trains.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do a &quot;/who&quot; and see that indeed there are many people here, over 60 at<br/>\nthat point. I also realize that I am the only player here under level 30. A<br/>\nsmall shiver overtakes me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI start to wander down to the north-south hall again, two Shin Knights are<br/>\nnow there but no one is taking them on. I decide to head south towards the<br/>\nriver/stream to see if anyone has left something down there. I turn the<br/>\nfirst corner to start heading east/south east when I see a dead froggie. At<br/>\nfirst he does nothing to me, so I &quot;/con&quot; him and it says he&#39;s ready to<br/>\nattack, and to boot he&#39;s close enough. Just then as I am thinking how<br/>\nfortunate I am that he&#39;s ignored me, &quot;BAM!&quot; he hits, no too hard, but since<br/>\nhe was dark red to me I make my dash back and zone. I also decide once I<br/>\nhave zoned that maybe I will come back another time and head back to<br/>\nFreeport.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is, did I just hit Lower Guk on a bad night, or do I just<br/>\nneed to be more patient? This being a vulture stuff is hard :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn Ablesong<br/>\nMith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;James Schuldes&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 11:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Shin Gauntlets and Greaves<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, I guess that they are &quot;live&quot; froggies - but my froggie faction is<br/>\nlong<br/>\n&gt; gone and they agro me.
