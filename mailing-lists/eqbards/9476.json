Since my normal Accelerando speed<br/>\n&gt; was 83% faster than normal running speed, I was still 33%<br/>\n&gt; faster than normal running speed.  (0.73 * 1.83 =<br/>\n&gt; 1.33).  Given you&#39;re unlikely to kill the cyclops until you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; 30+, you should be even faster than this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t imagine that a bard wants to get the boots anyway.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The real challenge is for someone like a necro to catch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this little guy while carrying that much.  I know that my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; necro would be crawling with that much on him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, they made the key component come from a random mob which<br/>\n&gt; spawns in multiple zones.  So getting the boots is more a<br/>\n&gt; matter of luck than camping (IMHO a great change, as those of<br/>\n&gt; us who don&#39;t like to camp finally have an equally or better<br/>\n&gt; chance of getting a nice item).  So if you happen to see tye<br/>\n&gt; cyclops, and none of your friends are close enough to get<br/>\n&gt; there in time to loot it, don&#39;t let the boots go to waste.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
