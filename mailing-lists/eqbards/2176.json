They think either think that a Bard sucks as a tank, or sucks at a<br/>\nhealer, or sucks at something else, and there&#39;s always someone that could do<br/>\nsomething better than a Bard!  I recently tried to discuss the advantages of<br/>\na Bard in a party with some guy on the EQVault board, but he really didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to understand what I was saying about the advantages of Bards.  Alot of<br/>\npeople have their own ideas on things, sometimes something happened to them<br/>\nonce, and they think it&#39;s a fact from that point onward, sometimes they just<br/>\nlike to believe in superstition.  The thread on the boat crashing and it<br/>\nbeing Bard&#39;s fault is one example.<br/>\n<br/>\nI typically group with the same people all the time so I generally don&#39;t run<br/>\ninto these things, except possibly when we add another member.  Maybe when<br/>\nthey&#39;re joining they choose to keep their mouths shut a little bit more.<br/>\n  )  But, I have been asked to not play Selo&#39;s when a Druid joins.... I say,<br/>\n&quot;Okay, NP, Can I get a SOW?&quot;  : )  IMO Sow is much better for saving a party<br/>\nwhen things turn ugly, cause I don&#39;t have to stick around and make sure<br/>\neveryone&#39;s under the effects of my song.  I&#39;ve died numerous times this way<br/>\nwhile saving the whole party.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the Jig... Every member of my regular party has said it helps.  There<br/>\nhasn&#39;t been a stopwatch timing kinda thing going, but they still say they<br/>\nnotice it.  Every mana user that groups with us I ask if it helps too, and I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t heard even one person saying no.  I&#39;d say there&#39;s enuf people saying<br/>\nYes, it does, to warrant believing it.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the URL to that EQVault thread if anyone cares to read it....

The cleric informed me Jig was making his mana regenerate slower, he<br/>\n&gt;&quot;should have been done by now.&quot;  Far from it for me to play a song not<br/>\n&gt;wanted, forgot the Jig.  After an easy battle and burnt mana, he told me,<br/>\n&gt;indeed, mana regenerates faster without any bard Jig.  Then things became<br/>\n&gt;nasty, one fellow brought a train and I saved them all with a lullaby, and<br/>\n&gt;no accelerando might I add, and quite a haul to the zone.  But they thought<br/>\n&gt;they were just good or lucky for all surviving that time and I didn&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt;to try explaining to them what I did, so I just camped!  Got me a little<br/>\n&gt;irritated, just the remark that Jig was making them regenerate slower!?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OO,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;that&#39;s what got me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All I know--these folks were hostile towards bards, and the fellow who was<br/>\n&gt;the leader had to flee so I only met him briefly, perhaps he understood our<br/>\n&gt;usefulness better.  When I hit a bad group I don&#39;t stick around, so I was<br/>\n&gt;with them maybe ten minutes tops, but perhaps I can&#39;t fault them from<br/>\n&gt;experiences I&#39;ve had with fellow bard&#39;s I&#39;ve grouped with--some bards just<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, this class takes some skill to wield with<br/>\n&gt;finesse.  I was with a bard once who consistently played hymn when all<br/>\n&gt;health was full, and only used bellow in battle.  That, now that, got me<br/>\n&gt;irritated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Er, back to my original question about Jig and Mana, sorry.  Has anyone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>done<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;any definitive tests on this?  With all my bard songs I have been able to<br/>\n&gt;&quot;play around&quot; with them enough, to my satisfaction, to understand O how<br/>\n </span></blockquote>they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;work.  This is the way I like things, dead reckonings hands-on kind of<br/>\n&gt;&quot;feel&quot; for how they work rather than really writing up numbers myself.<br/>\n&gt;Thing is, I studied way too much experimental methodology in school to<br/>\n&gt;really enjoy doing it when I&#39;m playing, heheh.

My<br/>\n&gt;friends keep telling me they don&#39;t have stopwatches and have no time for<br/>\n&gt;testing.  I know it doesn&#39;t make regeneration slower, that cleric tonight<br/>\n&gt;was just an arse, but I saved him anyway, fool didn&#39;t even realize it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Roop<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;They both have communities at ONElist.
