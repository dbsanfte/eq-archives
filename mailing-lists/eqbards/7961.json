We hunted orcs and<br/>\neveryone loved me, I was the puller, speeding them (and we had a shaman<br/>\nin the group too, but they prefered selo&#39;s), buffing, healing,  I saved<br/>\nthe party at least 3 times by kiting 3-4 mobs while my party killed a<br/>\ncouple off then returning to finish the extras. And i even got &quot;I didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow bards could do that&quot; when i used Lugubrious Lamet to lull some mobs<br/>\nso we could pull less.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile i was fighting i got THREE direct /tells from people i didn&#39;t know<br/>\nasking me to join their party. I love being a bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, i didn&#39;t have much luck using Lucid Lullaby. The mobs<br/>\ndidn;t sleep long and woke up quite angry with me, although it was nice<br/>\nto be able to taunt them off our 2 casters when needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the only healers in party were Shaman and Paladin, the Paladin<br/>\nused LoH once (on me) but otherwise we took all orcs easily (even when<br/>\nwe took 4-5 with 2 of them being yellow to me at 18th)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a note to inspire those younger bards out there. Stick with it, you<br/>\ncan make a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar, 18th Bard, Innoruk<br/>\nJerico, 24th SK<br/>\nAloren, 17th Druid<br/>\nSalla, 15th Rogue<br/>\nand many more</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
