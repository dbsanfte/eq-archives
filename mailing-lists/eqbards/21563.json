BTW, from <br/>\nthe example 100 = 10 secs, so time increment would be close to 50. You&#39;re <br/>\nalso limited to 5 lines. Lastly, the pause command can be stacked, but must <br/>\nbe listed first on the same line. Something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n/pause 50 /cast 1<br/>\n/stopsong<br/>\n/pause 50 /cast 2<br/>\n/stopsong<br/>\n/pause 50 /cast 3<br/>\n<br/>\nMay need to change the time increment to allow for general lag, but that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat testing is for. Also, there&#39;s no space for an additional &quot;/stopsong&quot; <br/>\nto stop song # 3, so I guess this isn&#39;t a whole fix-all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore interestingly, my enchanter buddy is lamenting this new addition and <br/>\nfeels it&#39;ll take any skill out of EQ. Enchanters can now set up macros to <br/>\ncontinually re-mesmerize things since they know exactly how long something <br/>\nwill wear off. He mentioned that Verant was against macros from the <br/>\nbeginning and is wondering what has changed to make them implement this. <br/>\nHe&#39;s pretty much against this enhancement.

I wonder if you could<br/>\n&gt;then just press the &quot;social&quot; key again to interrupt the current macro or<br/>\n&gt;whether you&#39;d be stuck waiting for your it to end?

It&#39;ll be fun to test!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;*Pauses in Socials*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause<br/>\n&gt; &gt;takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For example, a social consisting of:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;/sit off<br/>\n&gt; &gt;/cast 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt;/pause 100<br/>\n&gt; &gt;/sit on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds<br/>\n&gt; &gt;after you&#39;ve STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;same line.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For example:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;/sit off<br/>\n&gt; &gt;/pause 100,/cast 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt;/sit on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;another, and MUST be specified first on the line.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
