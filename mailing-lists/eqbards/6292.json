I just don&#39;t have the time, I am lucky if I can play for 3<br/>\nhours at a time 4 days a week with a long 6-10 hour session once per weekend<br/>\nand at that rate leveling is sloooow.  I have been playing since April and I<br/>\nam only at level 26 now so I will be lucky if I hit 50 before the add-on<br/>\ncomes out, so with that in mind I have a long life ahead of my character.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy big problem is that my playing hours are sporadic and I don&#39;t really have<br/>\na group of people that I play with regularly, I have to run around and find<br/>\na group or get in with some guildmates in order to make any headway in the<br/>\nXP department.  This is one reason I like my bard so much though, I have so<br/>\nmany different ways to play my character and that equates to a long and<br/>\ninteresting life over the course of MONTHS and MONTHS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI go in spurts, powerleveling for a bit to get new skills, then kicking back<br/>\nand trying to become proficient in them before setting out to get some new<br/>\nones.  On that topic I wanted to talk to my fellow 26+ bards about our level<br/>\n26 skill, Instill Doubt. I have never heard this one discussed at all, most<br/>\nlikely because our level 26 fear song is much better in accomplishing the<br/>\njob, but is there anyone out there who can share some experiences with this<br/>\none?  I am also including a spoiler for this skill at the end of this<br/>\nmessage because you can only train for it in ONE place in all of Norrath and<br/>\nI found the place.  Here is MY story about Instill Doubt:<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in N FP last night working on Brewing when a Paladin friend of mine<br/>\ncame along and I told him I had been fishing in the moat around the<br/>\nPaladin&#39;s guild and I then brewed some wine using the fish I caught there -<br/>\nI offered him some of the wine and we had a few drinks, then, with my<br/>\nfishing pole equipped, standing in front of the Bank, I targeted him and hit<br/>\n&quot;Instill Doubt&quot; which initiated that wacky graphical emote that looks like a<br/>\ncombination of casting a buff and doing a dual-wield attack followed by the<br/>\namusing message &quot;you&#39;re not scaring anyone&quot;.  The funny part was that it<br/>\nLOOKED like I was attacking him with my fishing rod and a bunch of people<br/>\nwere standing around the bank laughing their helmets off at the whole scene<br/>\n- someone commented, &quot;Look at that drunk half-elf dueling with a fishing<br/>\nrod!&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Faras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n  E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler Space...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe male bard on the top floor of the bard&#39;s guild in North Freeport is the<br/>\nONLY trainer in the whole game that can train you in Instill Doubt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 09, 1999 2:40 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Instruments vs. Melee quandry<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 02:17 PM 9/9/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;no prob, i know its not a flame, i like the discussion.  but <br/>\n&gt; as far as my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;character, i don&#39;t have all the spiffy items yet, and i <br/>\n&gt; still have fun with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;her and don&#39;t see the point of retirement.  in fact, my <br/>\n&gt; point is that adding<br/>\n&gt; &gt;new zones for level 50 characters benefits everyone else.  <br/>\n&gt; like i said, when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fear was open we were out of your hair.  and these aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; essentially new<br/>\n&gt; &gt;zones, they have always been there and intended on opening <br/>\n&gt; but they haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gotten to it yet.  opening these zones has always been in <br/>\n&gt; verant&#39;s plan for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the game.  so with these zones to be opening soon and the <br/>\n&gt; expansion, i do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;think it is in verant&#39;s plans to have these characters <br/>\n&gt; around for a long<br/>\n&gt; &gt;time.  hurry up and kabong me Talies before it&#39;s too late! =P<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heh - Actually, the reason I haven&#39;t kabong!ed this <br/>\n&gt; borderline thread is<br/>\n&gt; the fact that gaining 50th *is* important to all of us, and <br/>\n&gt; frankly, many<br/>\n&gt; of us want to know what we will be doing when we get there.  <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s nice to<br/>\n&gt; have a goal, but right now, I think some of us see that goal as a bit<br/>\n&gt; darker for all that&#39;s been said.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What can you tell us about 50th level that will make us want <br/>\n&gt; to achieve it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Talies the threadnazi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enter ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family Program <br/>\n&gt; WIN $100 to Amazon.com!
