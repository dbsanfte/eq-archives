Perhaps they just don&#39;t appreciate its gentle rythm and<br/>\ncadence, but I happened upon a document in Everfrost the other day about a<br/>\nnamed skeleton called &#39;vengeful lyric&#39;.. Someone who was looking for Karg<br/>\nIcebear out near the entrance to Permafrost said that he had just seen this<br/>\nskel take off like a shot.. I didn&#39;t think anything about it at the time, but I<br/>\nhad just started playing Selo&#39;s at the entrance to Halas..<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin mere seconds this mob was all over me.. he was way too big for me to<br/>\nkill (yet)..  But I firmly believe that there are creatures that DO NOT like<br/>\nbards instinctively.. as a list the following creatures dislike my bard more<br/>\nthan they dislike my Warrior (same level, race and have killed the same<br/>\ncreatures)<br/>\n<br/>\nbeetles (all)<br/>\nundead (greater and magic hit only it seems)<br/>\ngriffons<br/>\nevil eyes<br/>\nplague rats<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.. Still need to look into others, but I&#39;ll let you know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMilistrious Songspinner<br/>\nBard of the Elves of Kelethin<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, I&#39;ve read a lot on this list about how badly the critters hate us,<br/>\n&gt; never really experienced it till last night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I expected it to come from me healing my group - the way it happened was a<br/>\n&gt; bit of a surprise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was showing the group I was with what twisting guardian and protective<br/>\n&gt; rythms did for their resistance with a drum, and good god - every greater,<br/>\n&gt; db and barbed skele on our side of unrest was making a beeline for ME!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We probably could have handled it had I known the reaction was gonna be<br/>\n&gt; like that, and I sure as heck would have run quicker - thankfully, I am the<br/>\n&gt; only one that died.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was only affecting my group - these things came from out of NOWHERE - why<br/>\n&gt; would this act like such a magnet?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway - I think I&#39;m gonna get a really good group together (one that can<br/>\n&gt; handle that kind of heat) - and do it purposefully (a little less long) and<br/>\n&gt; we won&#39;t need to debate on who the puller is anymore - looks like I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; nominated as bait.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Check out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
