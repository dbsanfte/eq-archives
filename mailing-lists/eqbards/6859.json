The Arena may be quicker in terms of getting back to your corpse<br/>\nbut you won&#39;t have a flute to sing invis song (to avoid getting attacked as<br/>\nyou run back to your corpse).  Is this something I should be concerned with<br/>\nor will the wandering mobs in SK leave me alone?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Also if you are hunting Aviaks you want to have a Ranger in your group.  <br/>\n&gt; Since on my server (Karana) the Treehouse is majorly camped, but there are<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; many wandering Avaiks in the area between the Treehouse and Paw.  When I <br/>\n&gt; used to slow there I would just zoom around with Selo&#39;s till I found one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This was still quicker (and more fun) then fighting over the static spawn<br/>\n&gt; at <br/>\n&gt; the Treehouse :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Myself and another bard on my server, seem to be doing well in South<br/>\n&gt; Karana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fighting Aviaks in and around the Aviak City... We can solo Darters and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rooks, and in groups we can take harriers and Avocets, these things are <br/>\n&gt; &gt;rich<br/>\n&gt; &gt;also.
