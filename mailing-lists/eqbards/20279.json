I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; found it to be<br/>\n&gt; lag-city (2 song max) and have not been able to successfully <br/>\n&gt; hunt there with<br/>\n&gt; either my bard, shaman, wizard, or rogue.

What I like about it is<br/>\nthat with selos I can bail from all the way at the top of the snake ramp<br/>\n(unsure what other people call it now) and often make it out of the zone<br/>\nalive *laughs*. I like hunting the area of  the snake ramp in particular,<br/>\nmoving past the door to the chamber between the two commander rooms as level<br/>\npermits. The other nice thing about it is if you get in trouble chasing a<br/>\nrunner through the ramps around the big hole, you can jump in and make your<br/>\ngetaway. Then there are the Qeynos and halas fang quests, both of which are<br/>\nreally good. Mostly I just think it&#39;s fun, in a very rambunctious, stay on<br/>\nyour toes constant crisis sort of way :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
