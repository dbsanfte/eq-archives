A<br/>\nfew choice locales that are easy to get to are:<br/>\n1.  Follow the right hand wall as you leave Qeynos, heading to QHills.  As<br/>\nsoon as you zone into QHills you will be in a spot that no MOBs go anywhere<br/>\nnear.  Make sure you have plenty of food and drink, equip the appropriate<br/>\ninstrument/song combo, and go see a movie while your character skills away.<br/>\n2.  As you leave HPH going into EK, follow the left wall to where it opens<br/>\nup and allows you to go relatively far up the wall.  No one and nothing EVER<br/>\ngoes there.  Set the character up with the appropriate song/instrument<br/>\ncombo, and grab a good night&#39;s sleep.<br/>\n    As a good rule of thumb, any place in along a  zone&#39;s edge where folks<br/>\nusually don&#39;t go (for lack of MOBs to kill, merchants, etc) is a good place<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nI like 21 so much I&#39;ve gona back to it several times now :oP<br/>\n<br/>\nPS:  Will killing the Kerrans over and over ruin my faction with<br/>\nanything/anyone important?  The only faction hit is to Prexuz (sp?)  the<br/>\nOceanlord.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
