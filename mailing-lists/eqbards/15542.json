That can cause... a few problems.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *chuckles*<br/>\n&gt; But what&#39;s really interesting is that the noises from that <br/>\n&gt; program can <br/>\n&gt; still be heard, despite the wolf howls and spell sounds...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Talies the cdburner<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lol! Yeesh, well I guess your copies are coming out good. I had problems in<br/>\nthe past with CD Burns when the disk was busy with other activity, but I&#39;d<br/>\nassume that the equipment and software are much better nowadays.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we&#39;re stating the obvious:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Make sure your power strip&#39;s switch is away from your feet. (I&#39;ve done<br/>\nthis a couple of times)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Keep that portable heater away from your computer.<br/>\nPeople use these to warm their feet, but the heat can cause problems with<br/>\nyour computer. That&#39;s why it was that little fan spinning inside of it :-).<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Don&#39;t attach that nice big magnet to the side of your computer.<br/>\n(One of the light fixtures in the cubicles at our office, sticks underneate<br/>\nthe cubicle bookcase using 3 powerful magnets. Mr. Genius decides he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike the light to be under his bookcase and attaches the light to the side<br/>\nof his computer, then wondered why his computer started crashing all the<br/>\ntime.)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Don&#39;t run that happy99.exe attachment that a friend sent to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Don&#39;t just push the power button to shut off your computer. Shut down<br/>\nWindows first, and then turn off your computer. &quot;But I&#39;ve never had problems<br/>\nin the past.&quot; :-P<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Don&#39;t use that nice little tray in your computer as a Cup Holder. (oldie<br/>\nbut goodie)<br/>\n<br/>\n7) If your mouse pointer moves the opposite direction that you are moving<br/>\nyour mouse, turn your mouse over (I&#39;ve honestly had to help someone with<br/>\nthis problem).<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Don&#39;t plug your computer into the power outlet that is connected to the<br/>\nlight switch. (I&#39;ve been guilty of this myself. Doh! I was wondering why the<br/>\npower outlet was attached to the wall upside down in my new place.)<br/>\n<br/>\n9) Make sure kids know that the slot in the front of the computer is not for<br/>\nstoring Pop Tarts, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n10) Plug your power strip into the wall outlet, not back into the power<br/>\nstrip (Yes, I&#39;ve also had to help someone with this too. Of course, had it<br/>\nworked we&#39;d never have to pay for electricity again.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nWindleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet what you deserve with NextCard Visa!
