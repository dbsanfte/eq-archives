So she would solo a mino lord and then we would kill one.<br/>\n&gt; While she was soloing hers, I was chaining it to make it a little easier<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; her while we awaited our turn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One time, I decided to give her a little extra help in the form of<br/>\nFulfil&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Curtailing Chant (level 30 song?) which provides the MR debuff along with<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; small DOT (6 or 7 dmg per pulse).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So when the mino lord died, imagine my surprise when I got the exp for the<br/>\n&gt; kill!!!  She had been dotting the heck out of it as well as bashing it,<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt; her pet helping her, and whatever else a level 36 shaman can do.. hehe,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; yet my teensy tiny DOT somehow stole her kill!  Oh, and I wasn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; equipping a drum (it IS supposed to be a percussion song isn&#39;t it?).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, as I see it, there are a few possible explanations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.  She wasn&#39;t getting credit for her pet&#39;s damage.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  The DOT on Fulfil&#39;s is much higher than suspected.<br/>\n&gt; 3.  The druid I was with (who was supposedly afk) threw in a few zaps<br/>\n&gt; 4.  It&#39;s a bug<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Olgwinn Pendragun<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 32nd Song (yes, I made 32 in, of all places, Kedge!)<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
