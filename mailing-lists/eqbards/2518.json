It refers to any<br/>\nmobile entity that is controlled by the server.  I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthere&#39;s an English word for not-a-PC.  &quot;NPC&quot; is often used to<br/>\nmean only humanoids, and &quot;monster&quot; or &quot;critter&quot; is often used<br/>\nto mean non-humanoid NPCs.  When you say &quot;mob&quot; then it&#39;s<br/>\nobvious (at least to the programmer geeks) that you mean both<br/>\n&quot;NPCs and critters.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, it&#39;s quicker to type &quot;mob&quot; than &quot;critter.&quot;  Saves you<br/>\nfour keystrokes you can use later for button mashing in EQ.<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Bellow goes up a point in damage every other level or so.<br/>\nI&#39;m curioius though why you&#39;re finding it does 7 points when<br/>\nyou&#39;ve just gotten it.  If I recall correctly, it only did 5<br/>\npoints max when I got it.  Maybe wood elves have smaller<br/>\nlungs?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing with Dissonance and Discord lately, and if<br/>\nyou&#39;re in a place where area effect songs can be used, these<br/>\ntwo are probably much more effective than Bellow (e.g. Anthem<br/>\nDiscord Dissonance as opposed to Anthem Bellow Bellow).<br/>\nDiscord with a horn is pretty scary actually - I&#39;m<br/>\nreconsidering whether I should lullaby trains, or just kill<br/>\nthem faster with this song.  And it is really funny to see a<br/>\nmonster you&#39;ve never hit start to flee from you, then drop<br/>\ndead.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
