Thought they<br/>\n&gt; REALLY did screw something up.. And then it was my little bad joke that<br/>\ngave<br/>\n&gt; reason to some of these messages ;)<br/>\n&gt; Btw. Ive been playing my bard since april 2 1999. So he must qualify as an<br/>\n&gt; old bard, hehe. Im just a casual player so Im still only 48th level, but<br/>\nIve<br/>\n&gt; been on this list for a loonnnnggg time. I remember when the guy from<br/>\nverant<br/>\n&gt; and the tester roamed around. Those where the days with lots of good info<br/>\n&gt; and communications bards around norrath, forgotten their names though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Musiker, bertox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. M. Capozzi, I saw his name recently, he&#39;s part of the live team on<br/>\nLuclin.  (He wasn&#39;t with Verant officially when he posted to this list,<br/>\nbut had some inside dope.)<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably thinking of John Kim as well, he runs pretty rigorous tests.<br/>\nHe&#39;s still on the Concert Hall, last I checked. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
