Then you<br/>\ncan use alt-l or rt arrow to circle around the fight and keep a goo d eye on<br/>\nmost of the surrounding area without hitting any keys.  One tap of F9 and<br/>\nyou&#39;re back to first person.  Not my favorite way, but since flipping your<br/>\nhead around to look around you is so easy in real life, why shouldn&#39;t it be<br/>\nso in the &#39;unreal&#39; world too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 08, 1999 9:22 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Twisting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 8 Jul 1999, Sean Kennedy wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, what I do consider twitch elements are mouselook, and<br/>\n&gt; not being able to map strafing to individual keys instead<br/>\n&gt; of Ctrl + turn keys, because I&#39;ve never had the hand-eye<br/>\n&gt; to master mouselook+keyboard to circle strafe a mob and<br/>\n&gt; keep a lookout around me during a fight, or just to get<br/>\n&gt; behind it while it is focused on a group mate.  My wish<br/>\n&gt; list for the interface includes<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to map your movement keys to the left side of the<br/>\nkeyboard.  If you hold down the right mouse button (go into<br/>\nmouselook mode), the left/right keys will strafe you instead<br/>\nof turn you.  Once you figure this out, it&#39;s pretty trivial to<br/>\ncircle a mob while facing him to keep a lookout around you.<br/>\nDo be careful not to do it too much, as I&#39;ve heard your chance<br/>\nto land a blow decreases if you&#39;ve moved that &quot;round.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(&quot;Strafe&quot; incidently is a gamer&#39;s term, the simulation<br/>\nindustry calls straight translation motion &quot;slewing.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Glance Left/Right keys.  I.E.  while you&#39;re holding the Glance left<br/>\n&gt;      key down, your pov pivots 30degrees to the left, but your movement<br/>\n&gt;      direction doesn&#39;t change.  Make this available in 1st person POV and<br/>\n&gt;      the from the back 3rd person POV.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the only time I&#39;d like this is when running as a group.<br/>\nOtherwise it&#39;s too easy to just turn with the mouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I *would* like is to be able to switch mouselook<br/>\nfrom right mouse button down, to right mouse button toggle.<br/>\nSometimes it gets tiring holding that button down for several<br/>\nminutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
