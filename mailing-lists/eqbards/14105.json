Especially when you are working with<br/>\nladders like in lower guk. Sometimes they warp once and warp no more,<br/>\nsometimes they&#39;ll do that through the entire fight. I have been playing<br/>\naround with this and have noticed that successfully pixie striking the mob<br/>\nwill tend to stop it from warping.

It was to<br/>\n  address those dumb fawks who were standing in safe spots and killing<br/>\n  monsters.  Now the mobs warp on you.  (They can hit you, you cannot<br/>\n  hit them).  But they don&#39;t do it once, they do it everytime you move.<br/>\n  Thus, I lose 50% of my combat rounds trying to skirt around to hit<br/>\n  the enemy before it plops down ontop of me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And they wonder why players find ways to trick monsters or exploit<br/>\n  them.  I feel like the monsters are exploiting me!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
