I have<br/>\nmade and sold maybe 50 or so of these things at 5pp each.  Also a quick run<br/>\nto surefall will net you a mail run at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLament is the best song you get other than Selo&#39;s until you are 11th level.<br/>\nIt will allow you to easily solo critters characters 5 levels higher than<br/>\nyou just look at because they can&#39;t take 3 at once.  It allowed me to sol at<br/>\nthe bandit camp in Lesser Faydark 4 levels before anyone else I ever saw<br/>\nthere.  No one else could handle the multiple spawns they would have to<br/>\nface, but I could easily pull one out at a time and make boocou plat off the<br/>\nbronze spears they carried.  same deal in w karana with bandits if you are<br/>\ncareful.  If Lament is resisted you just flee immediately via Selo&#39;s and<br/>\nthere&#39;s no problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Webber, Jessica [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WebberJ@...\">WebberJ@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 8:15 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Newbie questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WebberJ@...\">WebberJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a flat broke minstrel of the 8th verse bound to Qeynos and I&#39;m wondering<br/>\nif it&#39;s worth my while to try to earn enough PP and make trek back to<br/>\nKelethin to purchase Kelin&#39;s Lament.
