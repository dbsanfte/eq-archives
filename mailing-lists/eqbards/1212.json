Give it a try! I think bards are the most fun of any of the classes!  I <br/>\nhave tried several and it&#39;s my favorite.  (lost interest it the others)<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Sing your songs all the time even when you selling.  You need all the <br/>\npractice you can get to get your singing skill up.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  but DON&#39;T practice with the level 2 song!!!!!  Chords of Dissonance.  <br/>\nNice little damage song but it will attack everything including guards and <br/>\nmerchants who will kill you instantly for you pain.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Hunt the nearest newbie area diligently.  I found it very easy to get <br/>\nto 5th level in one evening of play.  The first level song and a rusty long <br/>\nsword or scimitar should do the trick.  <br/>\n<br/>\n4.5  Kill any orc/skel/gnoll that is holding a weapon.  These weapons are <br/>\nyour better loot at low levels not to mention arming yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\n5.  My favorite area to level below 10-12 is Misty Thicket near Rivervale.  <br/>\nIf you can get there go.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  Sell stuff at the local bards guild (if there is one) for better <br/>\nprices.<br/>\n<br/>\n7.  Learn to fish for food.  Saves a lot of money at lower levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n8.  Soon as you can scrape together 4 plat. go to Kelethin and buy a Mino <br/>\nax from another player.  (they are almost constantly on sale.) Should only <br/>\ncost 4 palt and certainly don&#39;t pay more then 5<br/>\n<br/>\n9.  Buy tattered armor from player tailors.  best money to ac ratio at <br/>\nlower levels.  2-5 gold a piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nNuff for now<br/>\n<br/>\nYHS<br/>\nBujold the singing bard  (stuck at 11th)<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
