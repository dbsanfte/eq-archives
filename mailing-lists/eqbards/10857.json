But<br/>\nnow it is really starting to cause some bad feelings, mainly because he&#39;s<br/>\noff adventuring in the planes Guk, Sol B, etc. and I am still looking at<br/>\nanother 3-4 months at my pace of play to even get into the 40&#39;s where I<br/>\nmight be able to try those places.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really make me wonder what I am putting all this work into. While for the<br/>\nmost part I still have fun, on the nights when I join up with the world&#39;s<br/>\nmost inept group or worse can&#39;t find a group I begin to think about hanging<br/>\nthe lute up and calling it quits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is not something any one of us can change or fix, but I thought<br/>\nI would put it out there to see if anyone else had a similar experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn Ablesong<br/>\nMith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eqbards@...\">Eqbards@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 9:12 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Twinking Causes a Crisis of Faith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>\n&gt; and I just hit level 36.  That&#39;s definitely *not* fast leveling, but I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen a lot slower.  Before my bard I played a monk up to 23rd and an<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter up to 13th while learning EQ and realizing that the best class<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; the game was bard..  but I digress.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night I saw a level 9 bard in full Lambent, dual Ykeshas, Flowing<br/>\nBlack<br/>\n&gt; Silk Sash, Mistmoore Drums, the works; he was decked out like a level 50<br/>\n&gt; that hadn&#39;t been to the Planes.  About four days ago I saw a level 15 in<br/>\n&gt; full Lambent, and I assume he had MM Drums and other goodies as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got to say that this was *profoundly* discouraging to me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; working my ass off for the pieces of Lambent armor that I have and I<br/>\n*still*<br/>\n&gt; lack the boots and helm.  So here I sit, dejected on the sands of Oasis,<br/>\n&gt; being *less* complete than a guy that started his bard last weekend.  Not<br/>\n&gt; only that, he literally *laughed* at me for having 38 &#39;played&#39; days and<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; being level 50.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When there ceases to be any way for players&#39; characters to differentiate<br/>\n&gt; themselves from one another other based upon level (i.e. time and effort<br/>\n&gt; expended), what is the point of continuing?  I want, when people look at<br/>\nme,<br/>\n&gt; for them to know that I braved death and died many times to achieve the<br/>\n&gt; armor that I&#39;m wearing.  I don&#39;t want people to assume that I bought it<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; a farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked myself with it.  I am now<br/>\n&gt; &quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO DROP it would be a<br/>\n&gt; different story.  The bard that I saw in Oasis would have been in steel<br/>\n&gt; probably and I would have something tangible and visual over him based<br/>\nupon<br/>\n&gt; my efforts.  Everyone that saw me would then *know* that I had earned the<br/>\n&gt; pieces for myself.  They would know that I had pulled Gypsy Musicians from<br/>\n&gt; Mistmoore Castle for a lute, and that I had pulled Gargoyles in Lower Guk<br/>\n&gt; for a Basalt Carapace.  The Lambent armor&#39;s not being NO DROP has reduced<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; efforts to inconsequential and unnoteworthy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game that makes me<br/>\n&gt; feel this way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Crier Sharpsong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
