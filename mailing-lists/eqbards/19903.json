So maybe RoK Beta was tested by higher level PCs who<br/>\ndidn&#39;t need training, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that players are now<br/>\nflocking there from all level ranges, and as such, want to visit a trainer<br/>\nwhen they level.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about those Bards that have saved up practice points and just want to<br/>\nincrease a skill or learn the basics of a new language?  Unlike the majority<br/>\nof other classes (I think there&#39;s one other class that doesn&#39;t have a<br/>\ntrainer, correct me if I&#39;m wrong), we have to travel to Kelethin or Freeport<br/>\nfor the privilege.<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon&#39;s answer of (paraphrased) &quot;We don&#39;t want people to become totally<br/>\nself-sufficient on the new continent&quot; screams of being a cop-out.
