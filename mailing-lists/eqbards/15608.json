You can get it at Rokynn&#39;s wonderful sight: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who don&#39;t know of it, it is song list reference that I use<br/>\nwhen playing my bard.  You type in your level, as well as enter the<br/>\nstatistics for any magical instruments you are using, and it will<br/>\ngive you numerical values of each of your songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also shows known song stacking problems with other songs and<br/>\nspells (which I think I use the most!)<br/>\n<br/>\nChanges in this version are:<br/>\nFixed changes to Psalm of Warmth and Cooling.  Added Instrument bonus<br/>\nreference.  Added level 47 song.  Added Numbers for Selo&#39;s.  For<br/>\nlevels beyond your current level, numbers are calculated for the<br/>\nlevel that you can first play the song (so you can see what it&#39;s<br/>\ngoing to do when you get to that level).  Fixed level 30 percussion<br/>\neffects (bug).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n -  Reed Stormrwind (E&#39;ci)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
