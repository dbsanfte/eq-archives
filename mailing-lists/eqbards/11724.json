Anyway, <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; those who have yet to get the gypsy lute, be advised that this is no <br/>\n&gt;small<br/>\n&gt; &gt; task.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There is a much easier way to the music room via the main gate.  I suppose<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s possible to simply clear your way there, but there would be some very<br/>\n&gt;nasty fights.  Try to have someone who can pull singles, either from<br/>\n&gt;knowledge of the zone or high enough archery.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The area behind the music room is somewhat safe.  I went in with a 50<br/>\n&gt;druid who knew the area very well, so I just let him do his thing.  For<br/>\n&gt;everyone in guilds, see if there&#39;s someone who&#39;s experienced in<br/>\n&gt;Mistmoorian pulling, and make sure they come along.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I went in a week ago to help a paladin get his Soulfire hilt.  The SK that<br/>\n&gt;drops it is in the jacuzzi room, which we reached via the secret room<br/>\n&gt;entrance to the castle.  While sitting around waiting for him to spawn, I<br/>\n&gt;got HT&#39;d.  One mob came through the door.  Ok we thought, no big deal.<br/>\n&gt;Then another came.  Then another.  Then at least 20 more gargs, ancilles,<br/>\n&gt;ushers, thought spoilers all piled into this teensy room.  The wiz, who<br/>\n&gt;hadn&#39;t cast yet, was able to get off the port to faydark before anyone<br/>\n&gt;dropped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Definitely not a place to visit on a whim.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Athren<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
