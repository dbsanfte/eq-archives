(For example many bards<br/>\nknew Lulaby was 1 pulse duration since it was fixed from having a 3 pulse<br/>\nduration)&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk the actual history of Lullaby<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  In beta the following things were true:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lullaby had about a 5% resist rate<br/>\n- Lullaby had a 3 tic duration.<br/>\n- DoT did not break Mez effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis caused bards to be able to derail trains of blue, white and even yellow<br/>\nmobs with the following songs:<br/>\nCoD, DDD, Lullaby<br/>\nBAM buncha dead mobs, no risk to bard.  You could go to Blackburrow and<br/>\nlevel once an hour using this.  Obviously a TAD over powered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following change was made:<br/>\nMade Lulaby a 1 tic song (Beta 3.5)<br/>\n<br/>\nBards still able to derail trains by singing lulaby with weapons and<br/>\nslashing mobs to death.  Or 2 bards could work in tandem to derail trains as<br/>\nbefore.  Still way too powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing change was made in final (STEALTH)<br/>\n1)  Added 2nd resist to song (35% base)<br/>\n2)  Caused DOTS to break MEZ effects.  (GOOD!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with Lullaby now is that there was TOO MUCH nerf thrown at it.<br/>\nThe 2nd resist was thrown in at about the same time they made DOT effects<br/>\nbreak MEZ.  Also the fact that the 2nd resist doesn&#39;t work properly (IE:<br/>\nLevel and Cha do not affect it at all) causes the spell to be nearly<br/>\nworthless.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Fix Lullaby properly there are 2 options:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Get rid of 2nd resist and make the stringed instrument a requirement<br/>\nrather than an option.<br/>\n2)  Correct 2nd resist so that charisma and level AND using an instrument<br/>\naffect it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the only two options really necessary.  I wouldn&#39;t combine them.<br/>\nIf you require a lute then the 2nd resist is pointless as it&#39;s only purpose<br/>\nwas to keep a bard from being able to melee down a train 1 opponent at a<br/>\ntime and rest up in between.  If the instrument is required there&#39;s no way a<br/>\nbard could do enough dmg with his fists to kill even 1 creature, let alone a<br/>\ntrain.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard since Beta 2</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
