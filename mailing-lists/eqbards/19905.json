After all, one of the bankers (at least) gives out a quest that is<br/>\nKunark related.  Were they really going to move him to be a new banker in<br/>\nanother city?  I think not, his dialogue would then make absolutely no<br/>\nsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they never intended trainers to be present, don&#39;t know, doesn&#39;t matter<br/>\nsince bards don&#39;t have one.  Whatever the real reason they will never admit<br/>\nit if it was a mistake and they left some out.  Look at the whole ranger<br/>\ndefense skills debacle.  IMHO that totally removed all credibility from<br/>\nanything Verant says.  They didn&#39;t want to admit they screwed up by not<br/>\nraising Ranger defensive skills like all the other melee classes, so they go<br/>\nto a ridiculous amount of bother to give them a spell to make it seem like<br/>\nthey really didn&#39;t need improved defensive skills.  What a bunch of hooey.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s face it Verant is full of BS.  Their game is cool make no mistake, but<br/>\nthey are a bunch of arrogant jerks who are at least as big of babies as they<br/>\nclaim all their customers are.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill nothing we can do to change that.  Eventually someone will come along<br/>\nand supplant them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more bardly note, anyone spotted Fabian who supposedly now is in the<br/>\ngame???<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon&#39;s answer is based on &quot;We never meant this to be a one-stop shopping&quot;<br/>\nIMHO, people scream enough, they are more likely to remove ALL the trainers<br/>\nand bankers than to put in a few.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
