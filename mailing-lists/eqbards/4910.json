Two questions<br/>\n <br/>\n1) Will I see any advantages in EQ?  I would assume lag should be less of an<br/>\nissue and zoning a bit faster...<br/>\n <br/>\n2) The service I&#39;ve signed up for eventually will charge $20/GB upstream<br/>\nafter the first GB (i.e. the first Gigabyte is free) any idea how much data<br/>\nEQ is pumping upstream?<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks<br/>\n <br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\nDan Sniderman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
