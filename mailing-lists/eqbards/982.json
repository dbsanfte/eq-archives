I&#39;ll have to time it<br/>\nto be certain, but last night I lamented one dervish (not sure<br/>\nif I had my mandolin equipped), we attacked and killed the<br/>\nother, and the first dervish was still lamented.  If you /con<br/>\nthe target you just lamented, you&#39;ll notice it changes from<br/>\nthreatening or ready to attack, to apprehensive.  This is a<br/>\ngood way to check if those four laments you just did are still<br/>\nholding as you get ready to take out the fifth mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nLament seems to work for a very long time for me, enough so<br/>\nthat duration has never been a problem and I have never<br/>\nbothered experimenting with it with a mandolin.  Maybe<br/>\ncharisma has something to do with it since it is a charm-type<br/>\nsong.  I&#39;ll try timing it and report back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a four target limit for lament.  I<br/>\nknow there is for area-effect songs, but the /con message<br/>\nabove tells me the song is changing an attribute in that<br/>\nparticular mob which lingers for x seconds after your song.<br/>\nThat is, it works differently from area-effect songs in that<br/>\nthe effect is not linked to the bard (i.e. no connection<br/>\nbetween mobs that have been lamented).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
