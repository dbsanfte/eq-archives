I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>\n&gt; question is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory <br/>\n&gt; slots, and #2 bank<br/>\n&gt; set up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, <br/>\n&gt; switch to #1, switch<br/>\n&gt; out weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new song without<br/>\n&gt; missing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one of <br/>\n&gt; those things<br/>\n&gt; that just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to switch hotkey<br/>\n&gt; banks...<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Oh, btw, play with people 8 levels lower than you!  I played <br/>\n&gt; with a monk my<br/>\n&gt; level and a warrior 8 levels higher.  He went through 40 in <br/>\n&gt; the same amount<br/>\n&gt; of time it took us to go through 34 (about 3.5 hours).
