Of course water is drained at a<br/>\nfaster rate but keeping to the grassy area can keep it to a minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI found it a great place, the Grassy area, to get experience from 4th - 6th<br/>\nlevel. At 6th+ level is the end of the experience gravy train and you only<br/>\ncan earn a few silver from then on. But I suggest only hunting the<br/>\nArmadillo&#39;s for the experience; they carry little loot (I never found a<br/>\nthing on &#39;em). But the greatest danger is of course when a person draws<br/>\nsomething Nasty out of the desert and drops it in your lap. Too many times I<br/>\nfind my self, Back turned, and in pain as a madman is crushing my skull.<br/>\nUnlike a griffin, they make no noise as they approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have been the punching bag for Dervish&#39;s, Madmen, and a Dark-Elf with an<br/>\nattitude. All while my back was turned to the desert so I did not see them<br/>\napproach. Only catching the sting of their blade did I become aware of their<br/>\npresence. But don&#39;t let this risk detract you, I find it easier to come<br/>\nacross a target better than the Commonlands only for it lack of attention my<br/>\nthe general populous. It is like a secret fishing hole that not too many<br/>\nknow about...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t- SnowLynx, Gentleman Bard of Freeport...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kyle [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ksibbald@...\">ksibbald@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, May 02, 1999 11:40 AM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tAs far as groups go at that level, I&#39;d try North Ro. Most<br/>\n&gt; of the creatures<br/>\n&gt; there are solitary and a good fetcher will bring it back to the<br/>\n&gt; grassy area.<br/>\n&gt; This allows you to Wince away without fear of pulling anything big in. It<br/>\n&gt; also means you&#39;ll drain less water. Lastly, the guard is near in<br/>\n&gt; case things<br/>\n&gt; go way bad unless you&#39;re taking on madmen, dervish, or pumas. I&#39;ve also<br/>\n&gt; found the people in North Ro to be a bit more serious about grouping than<br/>\n&gt; anywhere else since the distribution of creatures almost requires<br/>\n&gt; a group to<br/>\n&gt; get anywhere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tAnd the biggest thing about North Ro...
