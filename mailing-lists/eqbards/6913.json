Since I havent missed any yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2) Why do half our skills cap at such a ridiculously low level that they<br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t even worth using?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am unsure what skills youre talking about, but Forage, hide and sneak comes to<br/>\nmind.<br/>\nForage - Imo it is working okay. It might be a bit tedius to keep hitting that<br/>\nbutton, but if I do I am able to forage plenty of food and almost enough water.<br/>\nI must admit that I dont do it anymore, but tend to buy my food. Maybe they<br/>\nshould change the forage skill so it have a even longer delay, but a higher<br/>\nsucces rate?<br/>\nTo sum it up. The amount of food you can forage seems ok to me, but the process<br/>\nis a bit tedius.<br/>\n<br/>\nHide - Well this one you need another person around to use for anything. If you<br/>\ndo have one around its ok when going afk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSneak- IMO its useless. I havent spent much time using it for real. Because I<br/>\nhave a hard time finding out how it works<br/>\n1. When I move slower is that a gurantee that it works?<br/>\n2. Is the duration limited?<br/>\n3. Is there mobs who can see through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I am more confident using invisio or fight my way through.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3) Is our level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody broken?  If not, what<br/>\n&gt;the hell is it supposed to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wasent that the one that you needed to target the mob to get the effect?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>\n&gt;monsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>IMO they should work in duels!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;5) Why do our songs get stuck due to lag, or when magical effects wear off<br/>\n&gt;(i.e. Guise of the Deciever)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I havent had this for a while, but when it did happen I just pressed a song<br/>\nhotkey repeatly and it became unstuck rather fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;6) Why the $#%@#$ does my drum still look like a small wooden twig?  And why<br/>\n&gt;does a mino horn now look like a small burlap sack?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah!! FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;7) How about some high level bard quests?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m sorry if this sounds a little harsh, but I&#39;m sick and tired of seeing<br/>\n&gt;petition after petition saying &quot;my monk should get bind&quot; or &quot;my wizard<br/>\n&gt;should be able to wear plate armor&quot;.  In my opinion, Bards are the most<br/>\n&gt;versitile class in the game, and the most fun to play.  We have more<br/>\n&gt;abilities than anyone else, and we get to use one of the widest ranges of<br/>\n&gt;equipment in the game.  Please stop trying to make this class into something<br/>\n&gt;it was never meant to be, and play your bard as it was meant to be played.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. I am getting tired of all the bitching about classes being unbalanced.<br/>\nEvery class is doing this, but IMO the only ones who can be somewhat justified<br/>\nare rogues and as poison skills and more locks, traps and stuff are implemented<br/>\ntheir arguments are falling as well.<br/>\n Some of the things i would like to see is some class related quests and<br/>\nequipment. I know that this is something that every class wants more of nomatter<br/>\nwhat there is availible allready. I do however think that bards are lacking some<br/>\nweapons esp. if the rumors about some bard/rougue items going rogue only now are<br/>\ntrue.<br/>\nThen I htink it would be very nice (and appropiate) with something like &quot;Kelin&#39;s<br/>\nstringed dagger&quot; (The piercing mandoline) or &quot;Selo&#39;s warhammer of drumming&quot;.<br/>\nThese could very well be implemented as rewards for quests?<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker Silverdrum, Bertox (21st werse)<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Excuse my less than perfect english skills, but english is a second<br/>\nlanguage... and i am in bit of a rush to get this out<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Elwyn Heartstring<br/>\n&gt;Level 40 Bard<br/>\n&gt;Erollisi Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
