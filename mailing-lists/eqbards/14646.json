Lets assume after the expansion<br/>\n&gt; (with a level cap of 60) that it now takes a 55+ person to go on a<br/>\n&gt; dragon/plane raid.  If I understand what your saying, then I should just<br/>\n&gt; remain patient until I get to 55th level and then go on raids then (12<br/>\n&gt; months from now versus 6 months from now).  If this is the case, then sorry<br/>\n&gt; but I don&#39;t agree with you.  If it takes me 6 months to get to 50 and go on<br/>\n&gt; a dragon raid, then I can accept that and be patient.  But if the rules get<br/>\n&gt; changed and I now have to wait 12 months before I can go on a dragon raid,<br/>\n&gt; then I won&#39;t accept that.

Now do you believe me when I say level-based systems<br/>\nare really really stupid?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir problem is that they&#39;re trying to raise the bar by<br/>\nstretching the levels already in place, instead of adding more<br/>\nlevels to the top end.  By stretching, you create the<br/>\nsituation where the rate of stretching exceeds the rate of<br/>\nsome people&#39;s progression, which means those folks end up<br/>\ngoing backwards.  I&#39;m not sure anymore if Verant really<br/>\nunderstands that the non-45-50 folks are their bread and<br/>\nbutter customers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sympathize with you folks still between L10-35, but<br/>\nunderstand that it&#39;s been frustrating for me and my L45<br/>\nfriends as well.  I put off playing in Sol B when I was 30-35<br/>\nbecause I figured I would have plenty of time to get a box of<br/>\nAbu Kar.  Verant took it out of the game.  We put off camping<br/>\nthe Evil Eye for manastones because we were having so much fun<br/>\nfighting other mobs in LGuk.  Verant removed manastones the<br/>\nfollowing week.  As I&#39;m closing in on the level required for<br/>\nplanes trips, Verant radically reduces the frequency of planes<br/>\nitem drops.  And now that I&#39;ve started to join dragon raids,<br/>\nVerant boosts the difficulty of the dragons.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s one thing to see long-term goals getting put further and<br/>\nfurther away.  Quite another to see things you were planning<br/>\nto do next week or next month made more difficult or<br/>\nimpossible.  I&#39;m liking the luck-based rare drop system I<br/>\nproposed more and more.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
