And<br/>\nran into a friend who had started a new monk so I am trying to help him get<br/>\nlevel 3.  I see Nixx DarkPaw run by and think, hmm... I can beat him to a<br/>\nsliver and use Sirens to wipe the damage list.  But apparently Nixx agro&#39;d<br/>\nthe Qeynos guard and I somehow managed to stick a charm on him before he<br/>\ndied.  And only moments later, I was dead too! Hehe, crazy bards never<br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of 44 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. If you find Lempich (sp?) the guy usually on the roof of his barn along<br/>\nthe river in West Karana, sitting inside his barn, that may be a clue that<br/>\nhe is too sick to be cured.  Ie, you give him the potion and he attacks you!<br/>\nOther theory is that at night he is a &#39;werewolf&#39; because he has been bitten.<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s what happened to me - he attacked.  Now, I could have easily<br/>\nzoned him but instead I killed him to see if maybe he would drop that &#39;rusty<br/>\nsycthe&#39; needed for the quest but alas only some thing for the necro or sk<br/>\nquest? Some other class kills him for that item.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
