I hope<br/>\nto pick up my copy today at EB in a nearby mall (preordered a while back and<br/>\nif not able to talk my way into a copy today, then tomorrow).  So, my<br/>\nquestions:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you get there?  Reading the 12 days of Velious on the main EQ site,<br/>\nit seems to say Odus.  Here is the statement:  &quot;We have received recent<br/>\nreports from Ak`Anon that a new continent has been discovered.  New marine<br/>\ntechnology recently developed by the gnomes enabled the Ak`Anon Marines to<br/>\nbreak through the Frigid Barrier to the south of Odus and in doing so, they<br/>\ndiscovered lands previously unknown.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat race do you plan on aligning with?  I think my guild is going to<br/>\ndefinitely align with the Coldain Dwarves by initially killing giants.<br/>\nDragons will probably be left alone, at least for a bit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone looked into the latest patches to see what they contain if more<br/>\nthan just new character models?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other good information out there?  Email threads on one of the forums?<br/>\nInside info from test?  Looking forward to finding out what you know.<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
