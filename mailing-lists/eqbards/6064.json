A same level warrior cannot taunt anything<br/>\n&gt;off me, not ever. Stopping hitting them does absolutly zip when you are<br/>\n&gt;singing a debuff like chains or dennons or god forbid you have lulled them.<br/>\n&gt;They will hit you, there is no point in not hitting back.<br/>\n&gt;I am in the near perfect group as I have said before. Warrior (3 levels<br/>\n&gt;higher), Cleric, Wizard and me the bard.  The cleric keeps me healed, the<br/>\n&gt;warrior taunts them off me. But saying I shouldn&#39;t be in there wacking is<br/>\n&gt;inane. I can do real damage and so I should be. Tell them to give it up. If<br/>\n&gt;they can&#39;t keep you alive it is THEIR shortcoming not yours. My group would<br/>\n&gt;really feel it was their fault if I died. THen again, they are good enough<br/>\n&gt;that I haven&#39;t died once while hunting with them. *smiles*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and then there is the famous....<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;SYLLY WEP!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;which was preceeded by...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;you try to punch a aviak harrier but miss...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;hahahaha, I have pulled on more than one occasion with the lute *laughs* I<br/>\n&gt;sing lull while I have it then switch in the pause :o)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt;Drawing is held each week through September 17.
