I find the talk of charging for\r<br/>\ncorpse retrieval a rather gruesome buisness.  I would\r<br/>\nremind ye my brothers and sisters that we cannot long\r<br/>\nstrike out on our own and engendering ill will by \r<br/>\ncharging for our aid, while economical for us perhaps\r<br/>\nat lower levels will most certainly turn poor later.\r<br/>\nRemember there are many music critics to start with,\r<br/>\nto inspire more is folly. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI find that merely volunteering my aid often allows \r<br/>\na reward of often great sums.  What&#39;s more as they \r<br/>\ngive of themselves many seek me out later an offer \r<br/>\ntheir aid for something I need or have not.. many\r<br/>\na party have I found myself desired in comprised of\r<br/>\nsuch companions.  My advise dear fellows of the art\r<br/>\ncharge nothing.. if one treats you poorly remember \r<br/>\nand spread the word especially to this list.  In days\r<br/>\nof yore in the world we call the real world.  Bards were\r<br/>\nof the druidic order and kept lore of all the families..\r<br/>\nit was said better a thousand deaths then the scorn of a \r<br/>\nbard.  Let us bring such truth to Norrath as well.. be\r<br/>\nmerciful to all... and let us truely create the lore\r<br/>\ngood and bad of Norrath.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGood fortune to ye all.. May you all be worthy of song.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAdon Bard of Freeport, Povar Server, Singer of glorious \r<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
