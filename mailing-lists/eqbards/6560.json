Prolly have to go find the guard she mentions and see<br/>\nwhat he has to say.  I heard that there is one out there somewhere that was<br/>\ntrying to charge travelers tolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I recently (altho b4 this last patch) talked to Lady Shae in Freeport<br/>\nand after enough red wine she tells you all of her secrets - including the<br/>\nname of some guy who has this list that Kane wanted - also she hints at her<br/>\nromantic involvement with him.  So, add that together with the Clothspinner<br/>\nsisters quest and we have a regular tale of intrigue!<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW: here&#39;s an excerpt from my adventures last knight::<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;The rain stopped as quickly as it had started.
