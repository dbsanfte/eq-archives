I let the thread roll a <br/>\nlittle because sometimes we all just need to vent once in a while - however <br/>\nthis shows that we don&#39;t have the maturity to discuss it without turning it <br/>\ninto a flame war.<br/>\n<br/>\nThread Kabong&#39;d.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the UberSemiDictator<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:13 AM 4/4/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: SteelWolf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwolf@...\">steelwolf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ugh. this post I find very undesirable reading. I think opinions about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant&#39;s quality should be left off this list. The start of this thread<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was basically a request to keep things from being a &quot;flame Verant&quot; event<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if I understood correctly. This entire post was nothing but a long rant,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and just showed to drive the orginial poster&#39;s point home. If your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; intent is to drive people away from reading eqbards that want to learn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more about the bard class, you are succeeding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Give me a fucking break, don&#39;t ever post shit like that again.<br/>\n&gt;   If you have a problem with me address it to me.  I&#39;m growing<br/>\n&gt;   very tired of you Verant asskissers.  That clear enough?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Use your power, and press the delete key, because you are the naive<br/>\n&gt;   one here buddy.  I for one don&#39;t give a shit about what you think<br/>\n&gt;   after that kind of bashing. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   btw, have a nice day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
