I<br/>\n&gt;put all I could into smithing, as bards make one of the best smiths (STR and<br/>\n&gt;DEX are key stats for smiths, and if you smith while singing Chant of Battle<br/>\n&gt;and playing your drum, you have much better stats there than most<br/>\n&gt;un-augmented races).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually I have seen that a players INT seemes to make a MUCH bigger<br/>\ndifference in smithing.  The skill of the smith seemes to play a larger<br/>\nrole in how well you can make items.  The people that will gain skill the<br/>\nfastest are those with the higher intelligence.  Just try teaching a troll<br/>\na new language as opposed to an Erudite.<br/>\nI know a Dark Elf Necromancer Smith that was able to get to 136+ (I say +<br/>\nbecause that was his skill 2 or more weeks ago) skill, in about two weeks<br/>\ntime.  It cost him about 500 plat in materials to get that good.  Yes he<br/>\nwas selling the successes as well.  In that short time his skill has<br/>\napparently equaled or surpassed most of those persons on the server that<br/>\nhave been smithing since well before him.<br/>\n<br/>\nStr and Dex may help to some degree but if you want to gain skill you need<br/>\nint.  I would hazard a guess to say that for someone under between 85 and<br/>\n100 int it would probably cost 1000plat to get their skill up that high.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack<br/>\n<br/>\nLong Live the Brotherhood,<br/>\nLomack, BCK-MoR</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
