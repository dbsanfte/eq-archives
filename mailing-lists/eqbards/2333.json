I say &#39;can&#39; because if the cliff<br/>\nwall is<br/>\nslanted there is always that possibility that you could get teleported on<br/>\nthe<br/>\nslant and immediately slide down, possibly taking falling damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the song will teleport to the bottom of any body of water you<br/>\nmay be in.  Uses again are limited, but if you wanted to see the bottom of<br/>\nthe ocean...<br/>\nOr perhaps you are getting chomped by a shark in the OOT and need some time<br/>\nto yourself before you die?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReece Pendell<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Beth Moursund [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 23, 1999 5:12 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Melifluous Motion</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
