There is overhead","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1285412533\">RE Twisting 5 songs:<br/>\n<br/>\nSongs take 3 seconds to cast.<br/>\nSongs last until the third pulse after they are cast.<br/>\nA pulse occurs once every 6 seconds.<br/>\nThere is overhead between songs (songs have to ungray, you have to start the next song, it takes some<br/>\ntime).<br/>\n<br/>\nAssume 1 second between songs:<br/>\n<br/>\nT-2  Song 1 starts<br/>\nT0 Pulse 0<br/>\nT1 Song 1 hits (1 up)<br/>\nT2 Song 2 starts<br/>\nT5 Song 2 hits (2 up)<br/>\nT6 Pulse 1, Song 3 starts<br/>\nT9 Song 3 hits (3 up)<br/>\nT10 Song 4 starts<br/>\nT12 Pulse 2<br/>\nT13 Song 4 hits (4 up)<br/>\nT14 Song 5 starts<br/>\nT17 Song 5 hits (5 up)<br/>\nT18 Pulse 3, Song 1 and 2 drop, Song 6 starts (3 up)<br/>\nT21 Song 6 hits (4 up)<br/>\nT22 Song 7 starts<br/>\nT25 Song 7 hits (5 up)<br/>\nT26 Pulse 4, Songs 3 and 4 drop (3 up)<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s possible to have 5 up at once for awhile.  But it&#39;s NOT possible to have 5 up at once all the<br/>\ntime.  Do the same thing with 0 time between songs, you&#39;ll go from 4 to 6, but you&#39;ll always drop back to<br/>\n4.  And 0 time between songs is impossible.  At some point between 0 and 1 second overhead time, it<br/>\nbecomes impossible to maintain 4.  That assumes no missed notes.  And clearly, that fractional difference<br/>\nof less than a second may well be due to connection and computer power, and have nothing to do with the<br/>\ncompetence of the player.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to APPEAR to get 5 up all at once is to twist in the BoH.  I don&#39;t know for sure, but I suspect<br/>\nthe Epic and the Siren&#39;s Song also blink when they proc, so they may make it SEEM as if the Bard is<br/>\nsinging 5.  Charm and Mez last 4 pulses, Anglitsch&#39;s Assonance lasts 10, so they can be used to bump<br/>\nthings up.  You can with proper ordering and timing of songs, and the right weapons, have 8 effects up at<br/>\nonce for about 1 second, then it comes tumbling down like a house of cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also suggest that the only way another player would KNOW that a Bard was twisting 5 was if the<br/>\nBard was singing 5 buff songs, and I challenge you to come up with 5 useful non-conflicting buff songs<br/>\nthat are worth the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, Virtuoso (possibly retired) of Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPS, I went to the BotB and I had trouble keeping 3 up.  We beat a pretty good team in the first round,<br/>\ntoo.  Twisting 4-5 was only possible for me when I was sitting in one place.<br/>\n<br/>\nPPS, I&#39;ve been able to consistently maintain 3 songs (I know from checking logs) even in conditions (such<br/>\nas NToV) where I was receiving text messages 15-30 seconds behind the event they were referring too.  This<br/>\nis possible because the outgoing information in EQ is about 1/10th the size of the incoming, and the<br/>\noutgoing info is pretty much a steady stream, as opposed to the huge bursts you get on incoming.  So I<br/>\nwould never rely on the screen timer.  Nice and rhythmic, just like a percussionist, is the way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Grady wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;m curious if any of the BOTB competing Bards, especially those that made it a couple rounds,<br/>\n&gt; have any comments.
