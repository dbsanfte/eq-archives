Maybe I&#39;m just not tactful enough (although I genuinely<br/>\ntry<br/>\n&gt; to be), but when I get into a group of 5 or 6 people there&#39;s always at<br/>\nleast<br/>\n&gt; one guy (and usually more) who just doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;, or says &quot;Who made<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; God?&quot; when I try and tell them that I can control the fight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone needs to /assist the puller&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not switch targets unless I say&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not use AOE effects or spells&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not DoT the mob you arent fighting&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for the cursing, but this sort of advice is generally greeted with a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Fuck you.  Check this bossy bard out...  Don&#39;t tell me how to play my<br/>\n&gt; character.&quot;, usually from a warrior or a necromancer (often Dark Elves for<br/>\n&gt; some reason).  I implore my group to let me lullaby mobs and yet they<br/>\ncontinue<br/>\n&gt; to, fight after fight, attack multiples.  Even if I stand there and lull,<br/>\n&gt; lull, lull shouting &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;fight one&quot;, &quot;fight one&quot;<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; just won&#39;t do it.  This isn&#39;t just one group, it&#39;s probably 8 out of 10.<br/>\nIt&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; discouraging.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Part of my problem might be that I play on Fennin Ro.  That server is<br/>\nalmost<br/>\n&gt; ALWAYS at the bottom of the list when sorted by number of players.<br/>\nUsually<br/>\n&gt; 1,700 or 1,800, even on a weeknight.  Weekends, forget it.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nFennin<br/>\n&gt; Ro hit 1,900.  Them&#39;s some crowded zones.  Playing EQ on Fennin Ro is<br/>\n&gt; oftentimes like playing Quake.  Four groups camp something and the instant<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; spawns they&#39;re all blasting for all they&#39;re worth.  I have gotten to the<br/>\npoint<br/>\n&gt; where I refuse to play in Highpass Hold.  The people camping the Orcs are<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; of the rudest, Kill Stealing-est, nastiest and most juvenile players I&#39;ve<br/>\never<br/>\n&gt; encountered in any game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s gotten to the point where I would consider abandoning my 21st level<br/>\nbard<br/>\n&gt; on Fennin Ro and start a new bard on another server if I thought the<br/>\npeople<br/>\n&gt; were friendlier.  What do you people on the (slightly) less busy servers<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; to say?  Are they any friendlier?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; After this group broke up, I joined one of the best groups I have ever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been in.  We had me, a warrior, a shadow knight, a paladin, a ranger and<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shaman all level 30-34 and we were fighting in the throne room.  I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using Pixie Strike (my new favoirte song), Lullaby, Anthem, Hymn, Psalm<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cooling and Constant Chain depending on the situation and we were the<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group there for a few hours.  We cleared both floors of the house and<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about a 5 minute break before things started respawning.  It was simply<br/>\n&gt; &gt; amazing... We handled some insane pulls (2 heralds, 1 justicar, 1<br/>\nmonkey,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1 zealot, 1 fanatic), never started a train, never died, and gained a<br/>\nlot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of experience (a bubble and a half of level 30 in 4 hours) and cash<br/>\n(100pp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after selling the 10 fine steel weapons I got).  Best of all.. i never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unequipped my lute :).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The tactics for various situations were:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1 non-caster: twist Anthem, Hymn and Psalm of Cooling.  If the ranger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; couldnt snare it, Chain it when it starts to run.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1 caster: Pixie Strike over and over and over to interrupt the spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is very effective against the shaman we were fighting as it stopped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the heals.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2 non casters: Pixie Strike until it succeeds, then Hymn, repeat.  Keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the mob that isnt being attacked messed and still heal everyone.. Save<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that shaman mana. When one dies, switch to the 1 mob scenario<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2 casters or mixed: Lullaby over and over again.  This will interrupt<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; caster(s) and keep one mob sleeped most of the time. When 1 dies, switch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the 1 mob scenario<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3 or more: Lullaby over and over again. Most mobs are sleeping which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; helps when there are multiple healers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For these tactics to work you MUST teach everyone to /assist the puller.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It usually takes about 30 minutes to convince the meleers who arent used<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to grouping with an enchanter or a bard to usually ignore the mobs who<br/>\ngo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for the shaman or the new mob that just spawned and joined in and let me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; handle it. So drill it into their heads:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone needs to /assist the puller&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not switch targets unless I say&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not use AOE effects or spells&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not DoT the mob you arent fighting&quot; (this happened twice last night<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I couldnt mesmerize the mob off the dotter.. he learned)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and best of all when you first join the group or when someone new<br/>\njoins...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hello my name is Celandro Spellsong and I will be your substitute<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enchanter for the night.
