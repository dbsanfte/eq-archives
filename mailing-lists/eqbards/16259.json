The rules do endorse<br/>\nthe following, farming by 50th level wizards who want to just wander into an<br/>\narea and take a rare spawn as you have to share; no one ever calling CS<br/>\n(hereafter referred to as Big Brother) as the wording makes it perfectly<br/>\nclear their intent, Make up your own compromises because if you bother us<br/>\nyou WON&#39;T (Sorry Harm) like the decisions we will make; and lastly forget<br/>\nrole-playing in any sense, we don&#39;t care about it, we won&#39;t support it, and<br/>\nif your role-playing causes anyone to lose game satisfaction we will punish<br/>\nyou.  Notice that while such actions are not allowed to adversely affect the<br/>\nenjoyment of others, other acts which are approved and definitely do affect<br/>\none&#39;s game enjoyment are specifically protected such as the right to camp<br/>\nguards.  Does anyone who plays this game really not care that the guards of<br/>\ntheir own race&#39;s city are being slaughtered before their eyes?  Does this<br/>\nact not reduce anyone&#39;s game enjoyment?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all I think the &#39;Pay Nice&#39; rules are worthless at best and<br/>\ndestructive at worst.  Every instance of EQCSSR could be replaced by Big<br/>\nBrother which makes me uncomfortable.  The one line that actually made me<br/>\nlaugh was one which is almost a direct quote from the old Role Playing game<br/>\nParanoia.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the Producer&#39;s Letter<br/>\n&quot;It is recommended that players make judicious use of the /report command<br/>\nwhen reporting abuse. The proper course of action is to file a /report, then<br/>\nfile a petition informing the EverQuest Customer Service Staff that a<br/>\n/report has been filed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Paranoia as I remember it, forgot to go look it up<br/>\n&quot;It is required that all citizens judiciously report unapproved activity.<br/>\nThe proper procedure is to file a report, then notify The Computer that a<br/>\nreport has been filed.  Failure to do so will result in termination.  Thank<br/>\nyou for your service, The Computer is your friend.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA pretty sad attempt on Verant&#39;s part.  From what I could read the majority<br/>\nof these rules are designed for high level players only.  I have never seen<br/>\na group or guild monopolize an area at the levels I have played (up to<br/>\n28th), but have heard of it happening at higher levels.  Many of the rules<br/>\nseem designed to force people to accept overcrowded servers by making them<br/>\nshare spawns that really cannot support multiple groups.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOther comments?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 16, 2000 7:42 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Innoruuk@onelist.com\">EQ_Innoruuk@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Worldly Issues & &quot;Play Nice&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are 2 articles that deal with &quot;online worlds&quot; worth reading (well<br/>\nskimming at least - first one is ok, but second one is very long)<br/>\n<br/>\nBasic premise of game mechanics:<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan Baron&#39;s article entitled, &quot;Glory and Shame&quot;, which may be found at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19991110/Baron_01.htm.\">http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19991110/Baron_01.htm.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor &quot;politcs&quot; and community issues within a world:<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000309/mihaly_01.htm\">http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000309/mihaly_01.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWith Verant deciding they want to go &#39;hands-on&quot; with their &quot;Play Nice&quot;<br/>\npolicy, these have some merit reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay Nice is doomed to fail.  The number of issues that will come up for<br/>\nresolution is so much greater than the resources that Verant has allocated<br/>\nto handling them (ie not enough Guides to handle all of the whiners that<br/>\nwill surface.)  Verant should have stuck to the mechanics of computers that<br/>\ngives them power: program code.  If a program lets the user do something,<br/>\nsome user (or many users) will do that thing. If Verant wanted to stop<br/>\nKS&#39;ing, they should have done it in code.  That way they stop each and every<br/>\ninstance and rules get applied to everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
