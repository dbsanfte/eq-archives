Their names<br/>\n&gt; would show up as a different color, say yellow since that will visibly stand<br/>\n&gt; out.  Yellow tagged characters can only be used on Test during specific<br/>\n&gt; date/times to test specified areas of the game.  They don&#39;t gain experience<br/>\n&gt; and they can&#39;t loot any items.  They don&#39;t need EXP or items because they<br/>\n&gt; are there for one reason only, to test changes made to the game.  Once the<br/>\n&gt; test period is complete, those characters can&#39;t log in to the Test server.<br/>\n&gt; Yellow tagged characters also would not be allowed to group with normal<br/>\n&gt; characters.  This scenario should alleviate any concerns of the regular Test<br/>\n&gt; server players who earned there levels the regular way.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
