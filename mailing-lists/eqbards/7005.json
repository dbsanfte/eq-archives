My ranger friends typically do nearly twice the<br/>\ndamage I do (probably 30% of that is due to double attack, the<br/>\nrest due to stat bonuses/modifiers).  And our defensive skills<br/>\nare a joke compared to theirs.  Clerics are almost our<br/>\ndefensive equivalent.  Their melee skill is weaker (4 pts/lvl<br/>\nvs our 5 pts/lvl + dual wield), but their magical offensive<br/>\ncapabilities more than make up for it.  My L31 cleric friend<br/>\nis easily able to solo battles using wrath, root, melee, and<br/>\nheal that I wouldn&#39;t stand a chance in at L35 (aside from<br/>\nusing charm).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of raw combat ability (melee + magic), I&#39;d say at<br/>\nhigh levels, bards are the worst of any of the classes.  Our<br/>\nstrength is in augmenting the combat capabilities of the<br/>\nothers in our group.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
