I unfortunately passed out shortly<br/>\nafter the Dracoliche fight around 4am Sunday morning, and CT fell a few<br/>\nhours later.  In all, we broke in around 9pm Saturday night and held<br/>\nit until late Monday Night (when the servers went down). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo about 50 hours of fear-fighting for 1 friggin piece of carmine armor,<br/>\nand I didn&#39;t even get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRazzan Godsnorer<br/>\nSupreme Wizard of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   In a long, tedious 2 day struggle inside the PoF, CT was finally<br/>\n&gt;   dropped on Innoruuk.  Had to ignore my girlfriend for hours on<br/>\n&gt;   end, so now I owe her big time. ;)  CT would have dropped sooner,<br/>\n&gt;   but we tried all this during times where most people had to sleep<br/>\n&gt;   or go to work the next day.  Thus, during the nighttime a small<br/>\n&gt;   group of people held the plane clear until others would arrive<br/>\n&gt;   after naps/work.  The combined efforts of 5 or 6 guilds paid off<br/>\n&gt;   around 10:00pm ET yesterday when the plane was finally cleared.<br/>\n&gt;   At 10:30pm ET Cazic Thule was dead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Two days in the PoF teaches you a whole lot.  More than one short<br/>\n&gt;   12 hour burst, imo.  I logged 32 hours of the 48 it was held.  I<br/>\n&gt;   know the zone like the back of my hand now, thanks to Solidarity<br/>\n&gt;   of Vision and exploration.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   24 people in the Cazic wave dropped him in less than 2 mins.<br/>\n&gt;   While we were buffing up, 4 mobs spawned in the zone, and thus<br/>\n&gt;   wave2 with 24 more people came to aid with the extras after the <br/>\n&gt;   God fell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   GMs were present during the slaying.  First ever on Innoruuk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I got the privledge of being in CT GR1, the primary and initial<br/>\n&gt;   group which charged Cazic.  Only one member of my group perished,<br/>\n&gt;   100% resisted Panic.  Verses of Victory and Mystical Shielding<br/>\n&gt;   were played in battle.  Cazic Thule hit me once for 40 dmg and<br/>\n&gt;   once for 171 dmg.  He never touched me again, although I was<br/>\n&gt;   Gravity Fluxed about 3 times during the battle.  I did over 500<br/>\n&gt;   combined dmg, including 2 yk procs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I think I died about 6 times on the whole trip.  Two of those<br/>\n&gt;   times, I really couldn&#39;t do anything to help it if you get my<br/>\n&gt;   meaning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   To be honest, we bent him over hard.  He didnt stand a chance.<br/>\n&gt;   Since I was the only bard there for 90% of the time, and since<br/>\n&gt;   I did breakin, I am now carrying the Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccalo.<br/>\n&gt;   Yeah it&#39;s useless, but it&#39;s God loot.  And the only one on this<br/>\n&gt;   server too ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Since there was nothing else for a bard on the plane, a lot of<br/>\n&gt;   people owe me hateplane trips now ;)  And I&#39;ve already gotten<br/>\n&gt;   2 invites to go during the next week.  More imbrued here I come ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic Distortion, 50th god slayer.<br/>\n&gt;   League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt;   Innoruuk <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
