Everyone I know<br/>\nthat did the upgrade to LiveWare 2.1 lost them, I assume because EQ doesn&#39;t<br/>\nsupport EAX 2.0.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get mine to come back, I had to turn down the hardware acceleration slider,<br/>\ncarefully hidden at Start Menu-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;MultiMedia-&gt;Audio-&gt;<br/>\nPlayback-&gt;Advanced Properties-&gt;Performance-&gt;Hardware Acceleration.  Notch<br/>\nit down to 75%.  Only thing that worked for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll try to tug the thread back to Bard-dom.  It took me a while after the<br/>\nupdate to notice I&#39;d lost the sounds, and a bit of pawing around on the<br/>\nEQ and Creative sites to find a solution.  As soon as I did, it saved my<br/>\nlife...  Moments after loggin in, I &quot;heard&quot; the stomping of an unseen Hill<br/>\nGiant while looting a corpse.  He got a few swings in on me but not before<br/>\nI had the drum armed.  I did the &quot;dead man speed walk&quot; back to the zone line,<br/>\ngiant in tow.  Boy they run fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards get my vote for &quot;most survivable character class&quot;.  I don&#39;t mind most<br/>\nof the other drawbacks as long as I can always run like heck, or charm, or<br/>\nlull...  If I had a dollar for every time I got below a bubble then wove<br/>\nAccelerando and Hymn with the Lute, only to make a final stand at the zone<br/>\nline and finsih off the unruly beast(s) that would have killed a hapless<br/>\nWarrior or Wizard...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Luvas of Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
