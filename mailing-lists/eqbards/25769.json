Personally I find EQ to be an AWFUL solo<br/>\ngame.  It&#39;s only the social aspect - and the interaction and strategy<br/>\nbetween the player classes that I find interesting - ESPECIALLY for the<br/>\nbard<br/>\nclass (where our strength is that we can fill in for so many other<br/>\nclasses).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want to solo - I fire up Civ3 - it&#39;s a MUCH better single-player game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that a lot of people will want to game for a 30-60 minute<br/>\nsession - and the difficulty of finding a group and getting setup precludes<br/>\nthat (especially if you are unguilded or in a small guild) - but again -<br/>\nthat&#39;s when I play some Civ3 (or whatever game it was in the past)...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n58 (almost 59!)

It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t too difficult to find a group.  And since I could solo very<br/>\neffectively, the wait to get a group never bothered me.  Generally I&#39;d just<br/>\nstart soloing and when others saw me taking on multiple mobs at once with<br/>\nnegligible down time they&#39;d invite me.  Never had to shout.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEvulia, 19 songs, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
