Verant seems to believe that the reason most people are<br/>\n&gt; leaving the game ( level 50 people that is or close ) is because we&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; beaten the game typically for a powergamer. However I know most people just<br/>\n&gt; got bored with it because there was nothing else to do with their current<br/>\n&gt; char or areas like Lower Guk or Sol B are just too crowded. If verant would<br/>\n&gt; add some more high level areas and fix PoF I seroiously doubt this would<br/>\n&gt; continue. On another note almost all the 40+ I know and group with have a<br/>\n&gt; secondary char some even have 3-4.  Hopefully Verant will begin to realize<br/>\n&gt; problems as more and more people leave.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree. I think they take it personally when we kill their dragons<br/>\nand make it look too easy. I don&#39;t really consider myself a powergamer<br/>\nin that I didn&#39;t play just to level. I just had so much fun playing, and<br/>\nhad so much free time for 6 months I couldn&#39;t help but level. Going new<br/>\nplaces, exploring new dungeons, dying a lot until you figured out how to<br/>\nsurvive and beat the mobs in them, that was what made the game fun to<br/>\nme, not racing to 50. A lot of people like to say powergamers miss big<br/>\nparts of the game but I explored every zone I could. Part of why I loved<br/>\nbeing a bard was that with Selo&#39;s we can go almost anywhere outdoors we<br/>\nlike and have a real good chance of surviving. A friend and I at L20<br/>\nexplored for days, hardly killing anything. The only zone in the game I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t been in until recently was Kerra Island, and that&#39;s because I<br/>\nnever found the entrance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I guess the kiting thing has gotten a bit out of hand in that on<br/>\nsome of the newer servers, people were leveling druids at rediculous<br/>\nrates, but, IMO, so what? There are also people leveling lots of other<br/>\ncharacters at astounding rates compared to the first crop of L50&#39;s on<br/>\nthe original servers. On The Tribunal, the newest server, there were<br/>\npeople selling banded on the 4th day the server was up. Heck, I was<br/>\nalready L16 or so when the first piece of banded went on sale on Tarrew<br/>\nMarr.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway this is probably drifting way too off topic for this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
