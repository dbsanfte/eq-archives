When I played in Unrest back in my 20&#39;s<br/>\nfine steel wasn&#39;t very common, in fact it was virtually unknown in the<br/>\nQuenos area, so I build up a bank full of it and ran over to Quenos to<br/>\nsell it. As I knew players over there make a lot of money in Blackburrow<br/>\nand probably many had store bought weapons, I offered to &quot;upgrade&quot;<br/>\npeople&#39;s store bought weapons to fine steel for free. Of course it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t really free because with my charisma I could sell the store<br/>\nbought weapon back to a vendor for almost as much as it sold for. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a few trips I gave it up though. Even with Selo&#39;s it was too long<br/>\na trip for the money you made, and it would take quite a while to sell<br/>\nstuff. Plus by then I was getting small bronze plate as loot more<br/>\noften which was easier to sell locally.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I started getting tells from people who were quite annoying<br/>\nwhen I told them no, I won&#39;t drop what I&#39;m doing and run to the other<br/>\nside of the world to sell you a fine steel spear right now. That kind of<br/>\nsoured me on the merchant thing and ever since I have mainly sold stuff<br/>\nback to vendors as it&#39;s much less hassle.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
