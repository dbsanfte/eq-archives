At","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1808446684\">Yeah, I used to do this too but about a month ago or so it stopped working.<br/>\nMy charisma is 117 so it&#39;s not like I some poor human with minimum stats<br/>\nhere.  At level 21 I can sleep the green gnolls on reaver hill about 50% of<br/>\nthe time they don&#39;t resist.  This was where I first noticed that it was<br/>\nbroken.  It used to work the way you describe and when I first got it I<br/>\ncould solo the small bandit camp in lesser fay by sleeping the bandits I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t attacking just as you say.  Now, I&#39;d get waxed easily and I&#39;m 6<br/>\nlevels higher.  It just does not work the way it is supposed to anymore, and<br/>\nsince nothing has ever been said by Verant and the nods message is unchanged<br/>\nI assume its broken.  Wiser heads than mine have noticed this.  John Kim is<br/>\na very successful bard and yet he has seen this and documented it before I<br/>\nnoticed it.  I started using it again after he reported it being broken and<br/>\nfound that he was correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: SteelWolf [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwolf@...\">steelwolf@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, December 04, 1999 9:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Use for Lullaby at L17...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: SteelWolf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwolf@...\">steelwolf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPossible use for lullaby at L17...<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend on his L17 Bard, and I on my 19 shaman were in East Karana<br/>\nkilling gnoll reavers and undead reavers. He&#39;d go pull 2-4 and come<br/>\nback. He&#39;d use lullaby to keep them all asleep except for the one he was<br/>\nattacking. The paladin with us used /assist to target the correct<br/>\ntarget, then tanked it. At the beginning of the fight, I AE&#39;d the mobs<br/>\nwith Infectious Cloud, a Disease AE DoT. Next pulse he&#39;d put them right<br/>\nback to sleep, nixing me off the hate list so I could heal or med<br/>\nwithout being mobbed. By the time the first target was dead, the other<br/>\n2-3 targets would have been chewed to half health by the AE everytime.<br/>\nIt was quite a sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things to keep in mind however, his stats were much higher than a<br/>\nnew player on a L17 because he was outfitted with better equipment, and<br/>\nhe&#39;d also played with many bards all the way to L50 in group on his<br/>\nprimary character, so he&#39;d been able to see Bards in action and ask many<br/>\nquestions about the techniques and tricks of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
