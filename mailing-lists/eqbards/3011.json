I used to use Earthlink, but<br/>\nthey go the whole way thru UUnet and with the troubles that UUnet seems to still<br/>\nhave occasionally I would suggest staying away from any ISP that leases their<br/>\nbandwidth from UUnet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAT&T Worldnet goes thru a combination of AT&T&#39;s own lines and Cerfnet. If you<br/>\nare on one of the servers that is on the Cerfnet backbone (as I am) this is a<br/>\ngreat way to go. Ping times are in the 175 to 240 range and I almost always have<br/>\n0 0 packet loss. And did you ever notice that when UUnet was having fits that<br/>\nthere were still a couple hundred people on the servers? THEY weren&#39;t going thru<br/>\nUUnet. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you call the various ISP&#39;s in your area you might be able to give the the<br/>\naddress of your server and ask them to do a traceroute to see what backbone(s)<br/>\nit goes thru. Dunno how receptive they&#39;d be buy you could try.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my humble opinions,<br/>\nTaelin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
