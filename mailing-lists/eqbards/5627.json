The wizard casts root on the mob<br/>\n&gt; and then the Shaman poisons it. Darn, sorry - you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; not close enough to the monster, your DoT isn&#39;t going<br/>\n&gt; to work?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How *#*$ stupid can they get?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The whole point of a DoT is to poison something. If we<br/>\n&gt; as players chase a mob that poisoned us, does OUR<br/>\n&gt; poison stop? I bet I can tell you the answer to that<br/>\n&gt; one rather quickly. Poison is poison. It&#39;s in the body,<br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t go away just because you have to chase<br/>\n&gt; something. I don&#39;t normally kite (how boring) but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; totally against them changing the spells this drastically<br/>\n&gt; for everyone just because some people do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, and 2 times NO.  You&#39;re worse than my fellow shaman!<br/>\n/em rolls his eyes in exasperation!<br/>\n<br/>\n********************************************************<br/>\nBRAD ON THE DOT ISSUE - NO MORE KITING<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was found on alt.games.everquest:<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted by Brad McQuaid on August 24, 1999 at 8:31:27PM<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kiting fix has nothing to do with range.  Essentially, DoT spells do not<br/>\ndamage the NPC if the NPC is chasing you and has a velocity. If he is not<br/>\nmoving or he is fleeing from you, the DoT does damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF we make this change live, and that&#39;s an IF at this point, we will most<br/>\nlikely also slightly increase  the durations of DoT spells to compensate for<br/>\nthe additional time necessary to cast the spells and  then set up your<br/>\ndefense (you tanking, another player tanking, a pet tanking, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Brad<br/>\n********************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this is in direct contradiction to what people CLAIM to have seen.<br/>\nTwo possibilities :<br/>\n1.  There&#39;s a bug that&#39;s causing DoTs to fail outside of melee range (which,<br/>\nif you&#39;ll simply read the above is NOT the intent)<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  The caster is simply too distant to see the dropping health.  This is<br/>\nmore<br/>\nlikely in my experience.  I often use Tainted Breath to pull, so that the<br/>\nmob<br/>\nis taking damage while I pull it back.  (I&#39;ve changed to pulling with<br/>\ndrowsy,<br/>\nthen popping TB when I reach my fighting spot)  Often, you will not see<br/>\nthe mob&#39;s health drop when your a ways from the mob, this is a known issue<br/>\nthat a mob&#39;s health bar doesn&#39;t refresh if you&#39;re too far away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, the phrase &quot;Increase the durations of DoT spells&quot; means more ticks<br/>\nof the poison hitting the mob, which will either increase overall damage, or<br/>\nrequire less damage per pulse.  (undoing part of the change the made to them<br/>\nto make DoT&#39;s more group friendly)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as a RP reason for them to fail, how &#39;bout when you turn to run, you<br/>\nlose control of the spell and it fails?  (too busy concentratiing on getting<br/>\naway)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to have to copy this response to my clipboard, because sure as I&#39;m<br/>\nsitting here I&#39;ll see a LOT of this when I read the shaman list :( </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
