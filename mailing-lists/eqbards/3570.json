So why when I went to see Ole Kith<br/>\nlast nite was there a regular Grizz standing in his place?  Wasn&#39;t him<br/>\ntransformed either, unless he suddenly drops to somewhere around lvl 10 when<br/>\nhe does.  Imagine my fright though?  If I had come up from the house side<br/>\nI&#39;d have died for sure as Grizz still jump me, and surely Ole Thumper would<br/>\njumped right in making me one big heap o Grizz food.  Also that &#39;a goblin&#39;<br/>\nshows up in place of one of the &#39;a wolf&#39;s gray wolf compatriots.  Wonder if<br/>\nhe has the mythical grappling device the Sheriff wants so badly that at<br/>\nleast three people will tell you to take it to him if ever you find one...<br/>\n<br/>\nHelped someone find their way out of Kithicor last nite.  Scary thing was I<br/>\nnearly got lost while doing it and I know the place.  Those high ridges sure<br/>\nlook like zone edges when you get tired.  Spooky to run two thirds the<br/>\nlength of the forest and not find the HighHold Pass you know is there!<br/>\n<br/>\nDecided to be really brave and actually camped in Kith.
