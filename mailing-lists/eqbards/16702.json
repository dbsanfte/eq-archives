(maybe because I play my<br/>\ncleric and not my bard now).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it really hurt us now that bufferes can chain cast their buffs?  It<br/>\nwas merely an annoyance  that you had to wait a few seconds for some<br/>\nbuffs to recycle.  I have no idea their system for cast time/recycle<br/>\ntime on buffs, its seems totally random and thrown together (that would<br/>\nbe a shocke eh?)<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:  From lvl 9 to 19 cleric buffs are Holy Armor (lvl 4) and<br/>\nCenter.  At 19 you get Spirit Armor and Daring.  Center has a medium<br/>\nrecycle time and longer cast time then Holy armor.  However, Spirit<br/>\nArmor has a REALLY long cast and recycle time, yet daring is short in<br/>\nboth cases.  I guess I fail to see the need to limit the power of spirit<br/>\narmor (gives 12 ac)...  <br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
