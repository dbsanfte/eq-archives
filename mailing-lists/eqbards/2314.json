I&#39;ve found it works best if I dont have people set follow to me,<br/>\n&gt; but to someone who&#39;s about the slowest in the party. Then I <br/>\n&gt; follow that<br/>\n&gt; person too, that puts me in the middle of the group instead of ahead,<br/>\n&gt; making it more likely I will keep everyone under the effect of Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; However this often also results in my client deciding the person I was<br/>\n&gt; following turned right and ran in a circle a couple of times then<br/>\n&gt; disappeared, when in fact they continued in a straight line. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A good trick I used to use before the follow patch that can still be<br/>\n&gt; useful is when you are leading with Selo&#39;s and need to slow <br/>\n&gt; down to let<br/>\n&gt; people catch up, instead of stopping, which usually causes <br/>\n&gt; most of your<br/>\n&gt; party to also stop to see why you stopped, crouch while running, which<br/>\n&gt; will slow you down considerably. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
