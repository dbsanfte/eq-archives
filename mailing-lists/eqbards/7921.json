Also, there is a big difference in twinking a character<br/>\nthat has never played, and twinking one who already has several high level<br/>\ncharacters.  I have a level 27 bard, and I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to<br/>\nsuffer through the wimpiness of low levels with a new character I start.<br/>\nI&#39;m certainly not going to give them really incredible items, but fine<br/>\nsteel, some leather, and some plat certainly takes some of the boredom out<br/>\nof levels 1-10.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhammer, Level 27 bard of E&#39;Ci.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:36 PM 10/5/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Miriana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Tue, 5 Oct 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; But are you really making their life easier by twinking them?

I know a Druid, who was givin the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tI think it depends on the class they&#39;re playing, and the equipment<br/>\n&gt;in question.  Giving a low level person full banded ot leather I don&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt;as a big issue, sure it&#39;ll be good for them for the next 10 or 15 levels,<br/>\n&gt;but there still many upgrades to all their pieces of equipment, and many<br/>\n&gt;of them come as early as the mid teens.  Frankly, I see most of my<br/>\n&gt;true gaming experience in everquest as between levels 20 and 49, and <br/>\n&gt;giving a player some equipment to carry them out of the newbie areas and<br/>\n&gt;into the levels where people start to find regular groups and learn the<br/>\n&gt;real joys of group dynamics and player interaction is definitely an<br/>\n&gt;enchancement.  Spending 8 hours chunks solo hunting wisps for money so I <br/>\n&gt;can scrounge the last few plat I need for banded armor is definitely not<br/>\n&gt;why I paid to play EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Miriana Windryder<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Steven S.
