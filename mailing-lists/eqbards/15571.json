I have been<br/>\nplaying with this in recent weeks too. But this should be a great one to use<br/>\nin the situation you describe.  It is supposed to reduce the agro radius and<br/>\nhelp you control your pulls. It&#39;s enhanced by string (accroding to song<br/>\nanalysis sheets although I dont have a practical proof of this) so you might<br/>\nwant to equip your lute (mandolin) and try to lament all the frogs that are<br/>\nclose together (target one, play song; target next one, play song; rinse,<br/>\nrepeat) and then pull only one or two at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI:  Since level 45, I have spent _a_lot_ of time in the PoF Spectre cave.<br/>\nSome things to note:  cant get reliable single pulls until level 47 if you<br/>\nare the only one pulling.  Fear/Chain is great!  Watch out for Roror!  If I<br/>\nlament specs to reduce their agro radius for the purpose of pulling singles,<br/>\nI have noticed that their con will sometimes change from &quot;scowls, ready to<br/>\nattack...&quot; to &quot;regards you indifferently.&quot;  And this is on blue cons too!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they really are indifferent.  I can get right up to them and they remain<br/>\nnon-agro.  Next time I do this, I will try to remember to &quot;hail a spectre&quot;<br/>\nand see if they have quest information &lt;hehe&gt;.  Now that makes me wonder<br/>\nabout my old fiend Kizdean Gixx.  I know he does have quest info.  I wonder<br/>\nif I could Lament him to indifferent then Charillion him higher?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 01, 2000 11:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Questions...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks Sylly!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night, we tried to pull &quot;a few&quot; of the frogs from below the Scryer<br/>\nroom<br/>\n&gt; in Upper Guk, and ended up with about 8 - 10.  We decided to stay and<br/>\nfight<br/>\n&gt; to see how far we could get and towards the end when we were all down to<br/>\ntwo<br/>\n&gt; bubs of health, I switched to healing with the lute and Anthem... I was<br/>\n&gt; TOTALLY impressed.  Not only did i keep everyone alive but we finished<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; about half health!  It was great!  I love my bard!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
