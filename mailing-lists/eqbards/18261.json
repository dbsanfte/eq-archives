We eventually got 4 groups in the city and were using AE to pull stuff<br/>\nfrom the first level Lord&#39;s temple.  Sometimes too many reavers would smoosh<br/>\nus but other times we could deal with them and get the Lord.  We have a pile<br/>\nof jade Reavers, the Thornblades, and the other one I mentioned in my<br/>\neariler post.  We did see a single reaver, respawn reaver, respawn reaver,<br/>\nthen spawn Lord.  There are 2 Lords that I have heard casting and we<br/>\neventually them both (iirc).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I looted an Ancient Coin off the Captain of the Guards.  Later talked to<br/>\nthe male banker and heard about his coin collection.  I guess if you give<br/>\nhim a Star of Odus (buy in Erud for 120pp about) he gives you a 4 slot box<br/>\nand asks you to fill it with 6 coins (is it just me or are these quests<br/>\ngetting harder?) Anyhow he says he will give you something a &quot;composer&quot; left<br/>\nwith him - sounds like he is hinting at a bard item.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Later on I got another Ancient Coin off bloodfrienzed goblin in Lake of<br/>\nIll Omen (they would not pull to shore but they did pull nicely to the<br/>\npartially submerged platform between the columns.  And there seems to be a<br/>\nnot yet open zone portal at the bottom of the lake.  Kedge II, Phinnie&#39;s<br/>\nRevenge?  Going to be looking for the other coins.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We had some fun in Burining Wood - full group - all 50-52.  Pulling more<br/>\nor less non-stop.  Look a 51 Gullerback (sp?), let&#39;s charm him... So, our<br/>\nnecro charms him and he makes a good pet: Gullerback_08 says, &quot;You will not<br/>\nevade me Wurm_18!&quot;  Heh, pets that summon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ended the weekend in Befallen. Delivered a set of gnome picks to one of<br/>\nour rogues. She was picking madly to get 200 and at 1.30am when I woke up<br/>\nfrom a short nap while singing elergy for her, she was still at 197 - ugh.<br/>\nThose last few points are extremely hard I guess.  Anyone know if there are<br/>\nany better doors that the Befallen ones?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s. got to remember to bring some CPA (Cabby Pale Ale) back to the drunks<br/>\nby the bard merch in FV.  Does it bother any one else to see that fem Barb<br/>\ndo the bard animation? And the oger?  Well, ogers are down right rude.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; You have a voice mail message waiting for you at iHello.com:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3555/7/_/451022/_/957192868/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3555/7/_/451022/_/957192868/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
