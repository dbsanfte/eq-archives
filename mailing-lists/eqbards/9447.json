Most all of the good NPC&#39;s were killed and I don&#39;t think<br/>\nanyone got rewarded except for those who got to loot the undead and<br/>\ndark elves (read greedy high level bastards).  The high levels weren&#39;t<br/>\nall bad, though, some would leave the loot if they couldn&#39;t use it and<br/>\nbroadcast to the zone where it was...so some greedy high level<br/>\n(who probably couldn&#39;t use it) would come and pick it up.  Bitter?<br/>\nNah.  Actually I only died once in the whole thing, when I was blinded<br/>\nby Innoruk&#39;s hate.  Friend of mine died at least 3 times and lost exp<br/>\neverytime.  My guess for the portal is Kithicor or Nektulos forest.  I<br/>\ndoubt they&#39;d put a portal in a town, even if it is Neriak.  I just<br/>\nwish I had something to show for my 3 hours of running around the<br/>\ncontinent.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobynn Merrilin, still 24th, E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaty Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.           <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\nCS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
