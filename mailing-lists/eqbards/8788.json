I was soloing at Unrest... killing Ghouls and Dark Boned, etc.<br/>\nI went inside and saw the thing hanging out near the porch door.  I check my<br/>\nsurroundings.... satisfied that no other creatures would interfere, I pulled<br/>\nhim out to the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ensuing battle was pretty touch and go... It finally came down to both<br/>\nof us at around a bubble of health a piece (relatively speaking, of course).<br/>\nI made the decision that I was not going to run.  Needless to say, I was<br/>\nvictorious and ended the fight at 20 or 30 HPs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is that I had *just* returned from Lavastorm where I had<br/>\npurchased a Combine Rapier.  When I looted the Blade Fiend, I was like<br/>\n&quot;Cool... a Fine Steel Dagger&quot;.  Then I examined the weapon and my jaw nearly<br/>\ndropped from my skull.  It was better than the Rapier I had purchased not<br/>\nmore than a hour previous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the Rapier went into the bank and Pugius became my new secondary<br/>\nweapon (a couple hours later, a Bard friend of mine gave me a Barbed Whip...<br/>\nthe most weapons I&#39;ve ever gone through in a 4 hour period).<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Thormael LGT [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thormael@...\">thormael@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 15, 1999 3:50 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Pugius Dagger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Thormael LGT&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thormael@...\">thormael@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pugius is a drop off the Lesser Balde Fiend in Unrest.

Its <br/>\n&gt; damage ratio is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;just a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; have any stat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;increases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this <br/>\n&gt; weapon be found?  It<br/>\n&gt; &gt;looks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the <br/>\n&gt; only one I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ever seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he <br/>\n&gt; got it...so any<br/>\n&gt; &gt;help would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same<br/>\n&gt; &gt;graphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ruldaas Riverdance<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ???
