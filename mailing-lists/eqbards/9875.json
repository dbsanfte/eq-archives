Although the staff<br/>\nis a good weapon, the -9 Cha is not good for Bards (as we use cha for<br/>\nsongs).<br/>\nUnfortunately this is as close to a ykesha as I can get for 20 ish levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan, bard of 27 songs (who can&#39;t wait for level 28 when his staff will<br/>\nproc)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a PGT now, along with a dirk.  I&#39;m level 25, and I&#39;ve had it for ...<br/>\numm... 6? levels.. (can&#39;t remember exactly when I got it).  While its true<br/>\nat higher levels the PGT becomes more of a hindrance than a help, at this<br/>\npoint for me, its still a help.  I&#39;ll be upgrading it at some point, but<br/>\nits<br/>\nnot a priority for me right now.  Lambent armor is :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone tell me what the worth of a Staff of Writhing on Povar is? I&#39;d<br/>\nlove to upgrade to that, if I get the chance.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
