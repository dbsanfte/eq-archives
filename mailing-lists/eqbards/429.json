And irritating, at that!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are all your stats?  I always thought charisma would have a bearing on<br/>\nit, but you stated you increased that with dex and strength at character<br/>\ncreation.  It is quite likely dexterity as no bearing on musical skills,<br/>\nyours being so high.  Do you have any exceptionally low stat???<br/>\n<br/>\n(I have no idea the formula used to determine when a song can be<br/>\nsuccessfully started, but I do know that the singing skill or instrument<br/>\nskill will effect the strength of a song, ie. Hymn of Restoration heals more<br/>\nand more the higher one&#39;s string skill.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, May 03, 1999 8:31 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Twisting question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My success rate for twisting songs with a 95 DEX and 45 singing/instrument<br/>\n&gt;skill is probably less than 33%.
