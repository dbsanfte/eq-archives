I would usually take less from the fire<br/>\nshields than my compatriots do to my high resistances across the board. I<br/>\nhave Crush&#39;s tunic which adds +8 to fire and cold as well as magic so I have<br/>\npretty high resistance with Elemental up. I was using a Dragoon Dirk<br/>\nexclusively at the time so I was hitting those bad boys a lot.  It didn&#39;t<br/>\nsem to help against their melee attacks but against the shields it seemed to<br/>\nwork.  Also the gobs liked to lob fire spells as well it seemed and they<br/>\nweren&#39;t much of a threat as I&#39;d resist most of the time.  I do seem to<br/>\nremember some of the drakes were green, others blue and they were no threat<br/>\neally at all.  Its been a while as I level really slowly due to my<br/>\ntravelling urges, so maybe I&#39;ll swing back this week and check it out again.<br/>\nI wonder if it was some combo of fire/magic resists that mattered.  Like<br/>\nmost of our things have an immediate check, plus another check when it<br/>\npulses, maybe elemental spells have an elemental check, plus another magic<br/>\ncheck as well.  Elemental for reduced damge, Magic for no damage or vice<br/>\nversus.  Worth checking out.  I did notice that with my drum I was able to<br/>\nresist 6 consecutive charms from an /con&#39;d red evil eye while guarding a<br/>\nparty thru Beholder in search of corpses two days ago.  When he sucessfully<br/>\nTashan&#39;d me I fled, fortunately the party was all near the zone by then.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 24, 1999 2:09 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Hunting Grounds<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 24 Aug 1999, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking Lavastorm.
