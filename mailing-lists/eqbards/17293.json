Fighting dw gobs, I have to fear then chain: fear then<br/>\nCoC: rinse repeat.  If I went with a 3 song mix, a fail on a fear would<br/>\nallow the gobs a chance to cast.  Some were smart enough to cast heals;<br/>\nothers would take their one opportunity to nuke me (in three days of<br/>\nfighting these guys, I think that they have made me zone 4 or 5 times.) Once<br/>\nI switched over to spectres and stayed buffed with aug, I could &quot;see&quot; the<br/>\ndifference in how fast the screen messages were coming -- *very* much<br/>\nfaster!  With Aug, my sta was no problem with 6 Note & Yk. Without Aug, I<br/>\nwould burn a whole bar of sta in a fight (or would play jig.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be interesting to know if this &#39;effect&#39; of going to 75% if bard or<br/>\nench buffed, carries for all of the PoA haste belts (rangers and wars and<br/>\n??)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs tired as I am of mashing buttons to get multiple song effects, I think<br/>\nthat I would be opposed to any system that automates it *unless* you have<br/>\nthe opportunity to go back to manual instantly.  Let&#39;s say that they give a<br/>\n&quot;song book&quot; and we can specify which 3 songs to be played.  Now what if you<br/>\nchoose: fear, chain, chords.  And now what if fear fails?  I for one would<br/>\nnot just blindly play the next song.  When it fade on the mob and it takes<br/>\nit turn to hit you, stunned!  You cannot play songs when stunned.  Then when<br/>\nyou recover, you would not want merely the next song because you will just<br/>\nget stunned again.  So, there would need to be and immediate manual over<br/>\nride available.  It&#39;s not the sort of thing that I would expect Verant to<br/>\nunderstand in their design.  I am scared they take the gem of an idea and<br/>\nimplement it poorly and then refuse to fix it after the fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, manually doing songs gives you the flexibility to switch according to<br/>\na dynamic battle.  Yes, too many hours in Sol-B and where the AE DoT&#39;s are<br/>\ngreat on the first 3 mobs you get, but the bard needs to be able to switch<br/>\nto pixie to handle the next 2 that get trained in when you healers are<br/>\nscreaming LOM and OOM!  So, I sure hate all the button pushing but in the<br/>\nreal battles, I think we need it as an option.  Play 3 songs - set and<br/>\nforget would be nice but... OMG!  Where did those 6 bats come from?  ZONE!<br/>\nSCREETCH!!! ZONE!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 03, 2000 12:17 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Belt of Concordance speedup<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I got this belt this weekend in PoA.
