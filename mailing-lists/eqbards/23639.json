The bard <br/>\n&gt; was singing the<br/>\n&gt; oddest collection of songs.  Chains (good choice with no <br/>\n&gt; snarer or slower),<br/>\n&gt; Curtailing Chant (with weapons) and Pslam of Cooling.  Eh???? <br/>\n&gt;  I suggested<br/>\n&gt; singing celerity night be more useful (though I am loathe to ever say<br/>\n&gt; anything) since the monk was dual wielding knuckledusters.  <br/>\n&gt; Oddly she was<br/>\n&gt; quite competent at crowd control.
