I was fighting bandits in W<br/>\nkarana and was easily getting some of the blue ones to nod while I killed<br/>\nthe others one at a time.  However, I noticed that if you were actually in<br/>\nmelee range the bandit would nod, but still attack.  If i backed off they<br/>\njust stood there and nodded.  I assumed from this that in fact lullaby<br/>\nmerely reduced the aggro range to melee instead of stunning them.  Perhaps<br/>\nthis was a change and the stealth nerf we are discussing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 22, 1999 2:54 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Lullaby secret nerf?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 22 Oct 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmm.
