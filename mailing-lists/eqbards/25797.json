So, where 400,000 subscribers in EQ represents <br/>\n400,000 people, 2.7m for Bloodpledge might not be as representative as you <br/>\nthink.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:52 AM 2/8/2002 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;There are several in the works now.  Shadowbane I believe is very close.<br/>\n&gt;Lord of the Rings is far from - if it will ever - be released.  The company<br/>\n&gt;that holds the long term development (I think it&#39;s Sierra owned by EA) has<br/>\n&gt;wasted three years. - laying off the entire development team and trying to<br/>\n&gt;start again.<br/>\n&gt;Horizons showed a lot of promise - but the management of the company was<br/>\n&gt;completely incompetent - and their best developers quit in frustration.<br/>\n&gt;They went bankrupt and were bought by NCSoft that will hopefully have a good<br/>\n&gt;product some time in the future.  They have been pretty tight lipped - but<br/>\n&gt;evidently are concentrating on developing the engine.<br/>\n&gt;NCSoft produces the largest MMORPG in the world.  In typical American<br/>\n&gt;arrogance - we talk about EQ being the biggest because we only look at our<br/>\n&gt;market But their BloodPledge game has 2.7 million subscribers.  That&#39;s not a<br/>\n&gt;typo or a mistake.  Those are almost all in Asia and they only recently<br/>\n&gt;started marketing in the US market.  They hired Richard Garriot who&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;heading up the US arm of the company.<br/>\n&gt;The upcoming 200-pound gorilla of the MMORPG market will also be released by<br/>\n&gt;Verant - sometime this year.  You may have heard of it - it&#39;s called Star<br/>\n&gt;Wars Galaxies<br/>\n&gt;         Slyde<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyway, have you heard of the TWO persistent world (massive multiplayer)<br/>\n&gt;Lord<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of the Rings games which&#39;re supposed to come out soon?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And is this (leaving for Anarchy Online or others) why EQ users seem to<br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;vanished over the course of the last year or so?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
