AND the song only<br/>\n&gt; lasts one pulse<br/>\n<br/>\nLocating song and Charillion songs fit this model.  None of the buff songs<br/>\ndo.  (I hate to do this but I will...) It&#39;s like they were gonna give us<br/>\nBind Affinity or some sort of special purpose but then at the last moment<br/>\nbacked off and said: &quot;oh hell, give them some kinda half-ass buff, maybe a<br/>\nrune, toss in some str/agi/or dex and a bit of speed - that should keep them<br/>\nhappy...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; , you have to refresh it like chain or bellow.  this song is<br/>\n&gt; so completely un-bardlike.  another wasted slot in our spellbook as far as<br/>\ni<br/>\n&gt; can tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother one of GZ&#39;s own &#39;good ideas&#39; ???  Certainly not something that<br/>\nsomeone who actually plays a bard (or even in groups with bards at levels 45<br/>\nand up) would have thought of.  Unless they think that it is something a<br/>\nbard can use to increase a warrior or other player&#39;s taunt to direct a mob&#39;s<br/>\nagression (away from the bard or current fenzy victim)?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
