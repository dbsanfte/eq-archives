But if they work together and both know what the plan is, it can<br/>\nwork great.  I have seen far too many enchanters commit suicide because they<br/>\ndo not follow one simple rule:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Let the tanks - tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do believe that they panic when they see multiple mobs.  Crowd control is<br/>\ntheir job after all and things seem to be out of control.  Then they get a<br/>\nresist and a mobs turns on them. So, they AE stun.  Now even if they mez the<br/>\nmob that resisted, they have the other ones beating on them. This situation<br/>\ncan go down hill fast.  I find that if they just wait and let the tanks<br/>\ntank, let the bard get one mezzed then they can pick another one to put to<br/>\nsleep.  Or, if they pick 1 mob to work on at a time. Attempt mez, if<br/>\nresisted, back away from the group, let the bard mez the mob attacking the<br/>\nchanter.  Also, working with a shaman and/or cleric is great too.  The sha<br/>\ncan slow and the cleric can stun.  In any case,  the most important thing is<br/>\nnot not AE stun, work one mob at a time and let the tanks - tank.  The bard<br/>\ncan do the first mez on a mob and then tank it while the ench puts it to<br/>\nsleep long term - but again - you need to coordinate this plan ahead of<br/>\ntime.  And I have been here done this - as bard, chanter and cleric - team<br/>\nwork, works great.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n3 yellows to go, finally...<br/>\nThe Pantheon<br/>\nSomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 25, 2001 12:02 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: My fingers are numb...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMakes me feel bad cuz i was trying to<br/>\nhelp our chanter mez like 6 things and I just made it so he couldn&#39;t and we<br/>\nall died.  *shrug* guess you have to learn the hard way sometimes :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
