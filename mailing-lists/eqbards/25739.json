Also it seems ruined pelts bottom out at 2gp ea, but i <br/>\nhave been trying to get 3 :)  I did fairly well with my medium <br/>\nquality cat pelts, sold them for about 2pp ea.  I have learned alot <br/>\nso far.  My strategy at this point is to let people make me an offer <br/>\nand it usually works out ok.  I have about 35pp saved up now so I <br/>\nhave been auctioning to get a dragoon dirk as was mentioned before.  <br/>\nAnd since I am back in freeport now, I may chance the journey to <br/>\nhighpass to check for tomahawks :)  Thanks everyone for the <br/>\nsuggestions!<br/>\n<br/>\n-fohat, level 11 half-elf Quelious Bard on Firiona Vie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In eqbards@y..., Bill Costlow &lt;atlatyl@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HQ bearpelts are the only skins you&#39;ll get a good price on from the <br/>\ncommons -- 2pp is prolly about right for the others...that&#39;s 40p a <br/>\nstack and much easier to find than HQ bearpelts for the same <br/>\nprice ...  Another thing you can do is sell deathfist belts (or <br/>\ncrushbone belts and lego pads, etc.)  These quests are quite good and <br/>\nthere is no shortage of twinks buying them for up to 5pp each.<br/>\n&gt; (I am using prices for Rodcet Nife.  Your server may be a bit <br/>\ndifferent).<br/>\n&gt; My opinion on tradeskills is that they are designed to be a money <br/>\nsink and protect server economies...kind of like 100k horses -- it <br/>\ntakes cash out of circulation P<br/>\n&gt; Better gear means less downtime.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;   compugeeke &lt;compugeeke@y...&gt; wrote: Thanks Bill,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *slaps self on forehead*  I had a HQ bear pelt a couple days back <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; tried to auction it but when i got no response i sold it to a <br/>\n&gt; merchant... DOH!  I will never make that mistake again!  What I did <br/>\n&gt; last night after reading this message: I took all the cat pelts i <br/>\nhad <br/>\n&gt; looted in freeport back to kelethin (where there are no cats) and <br/>\n&gt; sold the medium quality ones for 2pp each.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My biggest question is,  How do I know what prices pelts go for?  I <br/>\n&gt; am starting to become quite the fur trapper, and I think I can fund <br/>\n&gt; my blacksmithing lessons by selling fur (i am always going back and <br/>\n&gt; forth between freeport and g.faydark)  I tried to look for others <br/>\n&gt; auctioning pelts but didnt see anything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; maybe some kind soul can list fair prices for the cat and bear <br/>\npelts, <br/>\n&gt; mainly so i don&#39;t feel like i am ripping other PC&#39;s off, but also <br/>\nso <br/>\n&gt; i dont rip myself off.  I was asking 5pp ea. for HQ cat pelts last <br/>\n&gt; night and i got one &quot;no thanks.&quot; was that too high a price?  I did <br/>\n&gt; manage to sell 5 medium quality cat pelts for 2pp ea., and a bunch <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; spiderling silks for 1 gp ea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Or perhaps there is some internet site out there that lists this <br/>\nkind <br/>\n&gt; of thing?  all i found so far on the net are people auctioning <br/>\narmor <br/>\n&gt; and weapons and such...  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope this isn&#39;t too off topic.<br/>\n&gt; -fohat, level 11 half-elf Quelious Bard on Firiona Vie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In eqbards@y..., Bill Costlow &lt;atlatyl@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Fohat,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Magical weapons are always dropping in price and one of the best <br/>\n&gt; times to buy them is during off-peak hours in the Commons.

They go for 30-40pp and when <br/>\n&gt; you upgrade, it can sit in your range slot and you&#39;ll still get the <br/>\n&gt; MR and dex from it...I carried a dragoon dirk in my range slot <br/>\nuntil <br/>\n&gt; I could afford a Runed Bone Fork.  If you don&#39;t have  30-40 pp then <br/>\n&gt; hunt bears until you get a HQ pelt and auction it for 40pp or trade <br/>\n&gt; for a dragoon dirk -- You might get lucky and a tailor with extra <br/>\n&gt; gear in the bank will give you a deal...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Find a friend who has luclin and ask him/her to buy you those <br/>\n&gt; songs.
