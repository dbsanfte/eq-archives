How much strenghth is <br/>\nrequired to wear a full suit of plate armor and still run around and be able <br/>\nto grab some loot?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard Dexterity has an affect on how well bards play their instruments.  <br/>\nHow big of an affect is this?  Should i max my dexterity to ensure that i&#39;m <br/>\ngood at playing instruments?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, i&#39;ve heard that since bard spells don&#39;t use mana, they can play <br/>\nindefinately, is this true?  How does the whole &quot;song&quot; thing work?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess these questions probably get asked a lot...  if there&#39;s a FAQ or <br/>\nsomething i could check our, just point me to it...<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks all.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Wiz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
