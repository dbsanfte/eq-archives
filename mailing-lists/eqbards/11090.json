Couple groups doing bandits usually at any time, maybe a <br/>\nbrownie group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe distance to run from Steamfont to Freater Gaydark is not nearly as long <br/>\nas W Commons to RV or Highpass. Lesser Faydark is not nearly as high traffic <br/>\nan area as Kithicor is considering Kith is the main path most non-gaters <br/>\ntake to get from FP to Qeynos and back.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Quellious of the 50th Chorus<br/>\n-Stace Stormraven<br/>\nDruid of Tunare of the 26th Circle<br/>\n        Veeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Zones zones Zones<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 2 Dec 1999 08:15:11 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hate what they&#39;ve done to Kithicor. I personally don&#39;t mind the mobs as a<br/>\n&gt;50th, but I made the mistake of going afk at RV zone with my druid and<br/>\n&gt;someone trained 4 or 5 uber-skellies there. Luckily I got back in time to<br/>\n&gt;zone. It&#39;s the location. They should&#39;ve put these mobs somewhere else like<br/>\n&gt;in Lesser Faydark. I feel sorry for halfling newbies that don&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt;friends<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lesser Faydark?  You gotta be kidding, then Gnomes would have no way out of<br/>\n&gt;Steamfont.  That&#39;d be far worse as Lesser Fay has always had 5-10 times as<br/>\n&gt;many people in it as Kithicor.  Not to mention there have always been some<br/>\n&gt;undead in Kithicor so it fits the storyline far better there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKitasi </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
