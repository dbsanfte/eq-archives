We met a hummie warrior who had<br/>\ndone it like 3 times that day - he wanted the 2hs version you get as the<br/>\nrare drop.  It&#39;s damn fun quest - old Frosty sure knows how to train you to<br/>\nthe crazyiest places - can you can Bandits & Brigand, Scarecrow Fields,<br/>\nCyclops camps?  My bard fiend did all the talking and went thru the initial<br/>\ndialogs to start the quest - then handed in the stuffs and got the slasher<br/>\nno problem.  Of cousre his faction was prolly perfect.  I hear you can build<br/>\nfaction by giving lotsa gnoll fang to someone in Halas (a woman near the<br/>\npier?)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr get a barb to do the final dialog (opps he has to loot the head as it&#39;s<br/>\nthe no drop - well you could run it 2 times and he gets a sword (not even<br/>\nlore - so you can dual wield if u think its got good stats))<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJohn Robertson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, September 08, 1999 10:06 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] The Quest for the Langseax<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: John Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHas anyone here done the Langseax quest?  Last night, I did<br/>\nthis quest, to<br/>\n\t\tobtain one of the lovely Langseax swords for my warrior pal.<br/>\nFor those of<br/>\n\t\tyou who don&#39;t know the quest, it&#39;s an upper 20s type of<br/>\nquest, and though<br/>\n\t\tnot particularly hard, it&#39;s certainly time consuming.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI did all the parts to the quest, obtained the final item<br/>\n(the murderer&#39;s<br/>\n\t\thead), carefully sang my carrillon at the guy (who then<br/>\nregarded me<br/>\n\t\tamiably), and gave him the head.  To which he said,<br/>\n&quot;Although the wolves of<br/>\n\t\tthe north bear you no ill will... blah blah blah NO SWORD<br/>\nFOR YOU!&quot;   (Okay,<br/>\n\t\tthat wasn&#39;t the exact dialog, but you get the idea).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tIs it a warrior only quest or something?  It didn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nbe.  Anyone else<br/>\n\t\thad any experience with it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tEnter ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family Program <br/>\n\t\tWIN $100 to Amazon.com!
