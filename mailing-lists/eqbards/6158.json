At 5th an excellent choice <br/>\nfor weaving is Chant of Battle and Chords of Dissounce.  Chant will boast <br/>\nthe parties AC, STR, and DEX.  Chords will damage all the critters you are <br/>\nfighting.  Just besure to use the 3rd person view to stop chords if an <br/>\nunwanted guest (like a wandering guard) happens by.  At 6th you will have <br/>\nhymn of restoration which will make your cleric and tanks love you even <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Janko S.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:janko@...\">janko@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Is a lvl 5 bard usefull in a group???<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 7 Sep 1999 22:43:05 +0200<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Janko S.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:janko@...\">janko@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I recently had a fight about this so can anyone please tell me if a lvl 5<br/>\n&gt;bard is usefull in a group that contains lvl 5 to lvl 7 characters and if<br/>\n&gt;not when is it usefull.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Asandir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
