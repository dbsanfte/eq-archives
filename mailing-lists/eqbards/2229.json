They may not twist songs, or use their songs effectively. They<br/>\n&gt; also may not have good weapons or have weak armor (examples would be a<br/>\n&gt; L20 bard still wearing patchwork leather with some banded).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good example My level 9th Bard (with no twinking) is currently wearing 3<br/>\n&gt; pieces of banded. a level 20 in PW is ridiculous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
