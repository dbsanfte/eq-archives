Fierce Brewing was somewhat ridiculous, I agree, but<br/>\nat least it offset my expenses.  It actually -costs- me money to be a brewer<br/>\nnow, quite a bit since I experiment and have a lot of waste.  No<br/>\nexperimenting, with failures at master level, I&#39;ll end up actually spending<br/>\nmore to make the highest skill or lowest skill drinks than what I&#39;ll<br/>\nactually get back.<br/>\n<br/>\nFine, then I should sell to players, lets assume there was an actual demand.<br/>\nWell, a player can buy the cheapest drink from an NPC bartender over a PC<br/>\nBrewer, paying 3 times less, or even more if the PC actually wanted to make<br/>\na slight profit!  Most brewers give their wares away free, regardless,<br/>\nreally making this truely an expensive hobby, a hobby, not a trade.  With<br/>\nFierce Brewing, was nice because I could give away drinks, experiment, and<br/>\nat least break even.  Was nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all philosophy I suppose.  Some think that the only way one should<br/>\nadvance in any way whatsoever is through killing, rinse, killing.  Quests,<br/>\ndiversion.  Trades, diversion.  I think it would make the world much more<br/>\ndiverse if every member of society didn&#39;t have to play the part of the<br/>\nultimate hero.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nand sorry for off-topic ranting too, but bards should be interested in<br/>\ngetting drunk anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Sean Kennedy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:orang@...\">orang@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>snip<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Sorry for the off-topic rant, I guess I&#39;m just tired of<br/>\n&gt;people over on the pottery list whining about V nerfing<br/>\n&gt;trade skills.
