Actually he had found<br/>\na BRD (7) and was there already so I came to join up.  We putzed around for<br/>\na while killing various things and generally avoiding trains.  I tried not<br/>\nto be a &#39;know it all&quot; and tell the bard how to play his char but soon enough<br/>\nI broke down.  He is a good bard and knew his stuff but was a first time<br/>\nplayer although I think he mentioned a low level sha or druid he has/had<br/>\ntoo.  Well, his bard was in banded or chain and he was using a giant snake<br/>\nfang for his wep. Smart guy!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How come you don&#39;t use a lute when you play Hymn?&quot;  &quot;Uhm, we don&#39;t get<br/>\nstring skill til level 8.&quot; Doh! (Been a while - sheesh.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, enough of this. So I park my cleric and go get Sylly.  She gives this<br/>\nguy a Dragoon Dirk.  See how that works, heh.  And they sit by the door to<br/>\nthe upper ramp near the waterfall pool.  Sylly busys herself running<br/>\nupstairs and pulling elites and guards and the odd commander.  Damn cant<br/>\nrememeber where the green room is - heh.  Finally, they both ding a level<br/>\nand as we are trying to get out and go up top someone pulls a pretty good<br/>\ntrain to the &#39;berm&#39; next to the dry bridge. They are both hurt and we are<br/>\nnot grouped so I play Fear to give them a chance to escape the train.  Well,<br/>\nthat kinda works - the Monk escapes but the Bard dies.  And then Sylly is<br/>\nlooking at the biggest train she has ever seen.  Geez, that is *alot* of<br/>\ngnolls!  Well, since the 4 at a time that are beating on her cant do any<br/>\ndamage, she decides to kill them all.  Nope, Dirge was not memmed.  She<br/>\nmelees them all.  Took a good 6 or 7 minutes to chop them all down.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy then the bard has run back from Qeynos and we recover his stuff and pull<br/>\na few more for him to re-ding.  Hoo rah!  Let&#39;s head out - we need to go to<br/>\nKelethin and buy your new song.  And heh, my Wizard is waiting upstairs to<br/>\nfly us there!  So, we hit  Gfay and run up to Kelethin.  Of course, we need<br/>\nto hire a local wood elf to lead us to the bard guild (48 levels and I still<br/>\ndont know and *hate* Kelethin!)  I buy him his Lament and the next two<br/>\nKelethin songs and give him a lambent stone.  And then we fly back to North<br/>\nKarana (ok, my wiz is only level 29 but it sure beats the boat!  And yes, I<br/>\nhave 2 PC&#39;s so my wiz can fly Sylly anywhere she wants top go - as long as<br/>\nits Gfay, NK or Tox.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, hehe, things definately are not the way they used to be!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All of a sudden, the enchanter pipes up and asks in group &quot;Hey,<br/>\n&gt; want a res?&quot;... the pally says yes of course, we&#39;re all thinking he has a<br/>\n&gt; friend in the zone.  But instead, he sits down, camps, and pops back up<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; a 50 cleric in full planar armor.
