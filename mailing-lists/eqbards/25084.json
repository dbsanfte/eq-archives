I&#39;m gonna get one <br/>\n&gt; soon and try<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On the overclockers forum I frequent, I can recall no posts <br/>\n&gt; lamenting DOA<br/>\n&gt; &gt; processors offhand...and these are people who share every <br/>\n&gt; step they take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when OC&#39;ing their machines.  :)  The 2 biggest processor <br/>\n&gt; killers on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forum are heat casualties and crushed cores from trying to install<br/>\n&gt; &gt; heatsinks.  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There is no real reason to not consider equally an AMD <br/>\n&gt; machine vs an Intel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; machine, when shopping around.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Atonal<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nah, more bang for the buck...consider also, any pc builder <br/>\n&gt; worth their salt<br/>\n&gt; will have filtered the bad processors out before you ever get <br/>\n&gt; to see the<br/>\n&gt; machines, i.e. doa rate and failure rate are gonna be much <br/>\n&gt; lower than the<br/>\n&gt; builders.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Henrik Holm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEH@...\">HEH@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 26, 2001 2:27 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: OT Hardware (was:- RE: [eqbards] New Video <br/>\n&gt; Card and more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ram - th e results for me...)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And a bit more reliable (less out-of-the-box failures with Intel)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aye, Ive been an avid Intel fan, but do this still count? I <br/>\n&gt; know before K7<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AMD had pretty lousy stability and QA. I havent heard about <br/>\n&gt; any problems<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with k7 series though??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dunno, i quit the shop I was working at a little over a month ago, and<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t messed with any since then, but the failure rate was <br/>\n&gt; still pretty<br/>\n&gt; bad about 3 months ago.  More than I would trust, but AMD <br/>\n&gt; seems to be alot<br/>\n&gt; better about warranty issues than Intel...you can get a <br/>\n&gt; replacement AMD<br/>\n&gt; rather quickly (if you didn&#39;t nuke it w/ heat or crush it) while Intel<br/>\n&gt; wanted to take a while and test the processor you sent back, <br/>\n&gt; etc.  (from an<br/>\n&gt; OEM source...most of ya&#39;ll won&#39;t have that channel).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My take on the whole issue is:<br/>\n&gt; If you need a solid business machine, buy one from the big <br/>\n&gt; manufacturers,<br/>\n&gt; i.e. Dell, Gateway, etc.  AMD/Intel<br/>\n&gt; If you want a solid gaming machine, buy one from the big gaming<br/>\n&gt; manufacturers, i.e. Falcon Northwest, Alienware, etc. AMD<br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t mind dinking around, and possibly having some <br/>\n&gt; major downtime,<br/>\n&gt; build it yourself. Intel before AMD<br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t have the cash to invest in one of the big rigs, build it<br/>\n&gt; yourself, but be ready for some pitfalls. AMD before Intel.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, yeah...I have been real impressed with the 2 machines <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen from<br/>\n&gt; Alienware...One a couple of years ago, was the fastest PII I <br/>\n&gt; had ever seen,<br/>\n&gt; doing anything.  The latest and greatest my buddy has, AMD <br/>\n&gt; 1.3, top of the<br/>\n&gt; line Alienware, absolutely smokes on any task you run on <br/>\n&gt; it...he dual boots<br/>\n&gt; between win2k and win98se...and both os&#39;s tear up games.  (I have no<br/>\n&gt; association to Alienware, don&#39;t even own one...but the next <br/>\n&gt; machine I buy<br/>\n&gt; instead of build is gonna come from there...hmm...if I ever <br/>\n&gt; buy a machine<br/>\n&gt; again...hehe)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; MacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\n&gt; Bard stuck on bar 40<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro Blood Tide<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
