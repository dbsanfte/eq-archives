Explain for the slow members of our<br/>\n&gt; audience (ie, ME.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Previously, invisibility had a chance of flickering off at any<br/>\ntime.  Since there are 6 seconds between invisibility pulses,<br/>\nthat is 6 seconds of vulnerability between pulses.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow there&#39;s a message that appears a set amount of time before<br/>\nit flickers off.  For this to work, the game must determine<br/>\nthat your invisibility will flicker off, give you the message,<br/>\nwait a set amount of time, then flicker off.  I noticed that<br/>\nwhen I got the message, my invisibility did *not* flicker off.<br/>\nSo it seems our song pulses &quot;refreshes&quot; the invisibility and<br/>\noverrides this determination that it will flicker off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the time between the message and flickering is 5<br/>\nseconds, with 6 second pulses, that leaves 6 - 5 = 1 second of<br/>\nvulnerability to this happening.  If the time for the message<br/>\nis 6 seconds or more, our invisibility can never flicker off<br/>\nbecause it will *always* be &quot;refreshed&quot; before it can flicker<br/>\noff.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
