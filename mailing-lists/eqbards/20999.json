On the recently-wiped Gameplay board,<br/>\nthere are 10 <br/>\nseparate posts with the words &quot;chain&quot; or &quot;snare&quot; in the titles which discuss<br/>\nthe nerf to <br/>\nthe level 23 song, and 13 separate posts with the words &quot;lullaby&quot; or &quot;mez&quot;<br/>\nin the title <br/>\nwhich discuss the problem with Lullaby and Pixie Strike.

Isn&#39;t it his JOB to know?  Isn&#39;t he supposed to read<br/>\nat LEAST the <br/>\nfirst post in a new thread?  Or does he just notice the word &quot;bard&quot; in the<br/>\ntitle and blow <br/>\nit off?  I work a full-time job, and I STILL know what most of the major<br/>\nissues are that <br/>\nare bothering other players of ALL types, not just bards.  Two months ago he<br/>\ntells us that <br/>\nChains should not have been nerfed, and now he has no idea what we&#39;re<br/>\ntalking about?  He <br/>\nthinks that maybe someone somewhere mentioned in passing that Lullaby is<br/>\njust fine, so that <br/>\nmakes it OK?  I&#39;m apoplectic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like talking to a freaking rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 52 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
