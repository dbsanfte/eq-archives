Those were the prices at the armor seller in the wood elf <br/>\ncity.  (AFTER I bought it, I realized that it was size Medium rather than <br/>\nsize Small, so I lost about 250 plat selling it back again. OUCH!  I <br/>\nfinally found the size Small one in the Dwarf city.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been fighting in Cazic lately.  According to some posts on the EQVault <br/>\nbug board, Cazic resets all your faction ratings to their default values. <br/>\n If this is true, then it would account for some price differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
