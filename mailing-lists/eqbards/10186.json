Most of the stuff on Rokenn&#39;s<br/>\nweb site is correct because he and I (and others) are actively<br/>\nchecking the stuff to make sure it&#39;s accurate.  Celerity gives<br/>\nan agi buff (which in turn causes an AC increase), and it<br/>\ngives a 15% boost to attack speed using:<br/>\n<br/>\n100 * (1 - new_delay/old_delay)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is roughly half the enchanter Celerity speedup (which<br/>\nvaries by level, but I haven&#39;t noticed any level variance with<br/>\nour Celerity).  AFAIK, all our attack speedups are half the<br/>\nequivalent-level enchanter speedups.
