Although we are<br/>\ngenerally bards here, with bardic concerns, it is my belief that, with a<br/>\nstrong bias toward bardic concerns in bardic terms, this forum is easily<br/>\none of the best, if not the best, for considerations of life in Norrath in<br/>\ngeneral.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond only to being there, it is certainly my most important and effective<br/>\nmeans of understanding how Thrush may most enjoy and profit from his life<br/>\nin Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:10 AM 6/29/99 -0700, jay schultze wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t know, for me it&#39;s just so much easier to cry out, &quot;proc damn you!! <br/>\n&gt;proc now or i&#39;ll trade you in!

I imagine shaking the fool<br/>\nweapon between blows and thinking, &quot;It&#39;s supposed to cast that fool spell,<br/>\nwhy won&#39;t it do it when I need it most.  I need a rune I can touch or a<br/>\nword I can say to make it cast when *I* want it to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine that the recalcitrant caster is not a weapon that casts in its own<br/>\nsweet time and whim but rather a slow, confused, undependable member of<br/>\nyour party.  I doubt you&#39;d feel the need for a special word to encourage<br/>\nthe person.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I think about it the more clear it is to me that trying to assign<br/>\na special word to the special case overall results in more obscurity than<br/>\nlight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt that I&#39;ve influenced anyone or even begun to establish a convention<br/>\nthat will stick, but the participants have helped me clarify my own thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Norrath we have spell-casting beings and spell-casting weapons.  They<br/>\nhave varied degrees of reliability.  There may be some that will perform on<br/>\ncommand and some that have their own sense of when to cast.  None need<br/>\nspecial names.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that, I bet I can explain to a newbie more clearly and quickly than<br/>\nthose who pick up programmer slang.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant is classic.  To the detriment of useful information floww, the<br/>\nprogrammers and people who run the systems are so steeped in the code and<br/>\nthe writers of documentation so weak or nonexistent that instead of<br/>\nreasonable terminology and documentation we get programmer&#39;s notes and<br/>\nsystem operator&#39;s terminology.  The underlying mechanisms impinge far too<br/>\nmuch on the virtual reality and we are left grasping for understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
