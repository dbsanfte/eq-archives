First was at 6th lvl<br/>\nwhen  Orc Centurians were spawning atop the Orc lift<br/>\nin Klelthin.  We retreated from Orc Hill because the<br/>\nvolume was too much for us.  Kept getting faction<br/>\nmessages even tho we weren&#39;t fighting any more....got<br/>\nto the bottom of the lift and rested.  Kept getting<br/>\nfaction messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guards at Kelethin are a bit dense...we were<br/>\nattacked again and again.  We moved to the top of the<br/>\nlift....kept on getting faction messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nResting at the top of the lift, faction messages<br/>\ncontinued.  Cents were spawning among us and<br/>\nattacking.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy petition was answered by GM Traikis who told me: <br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s fairly common for orcs to spawn above the lift.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not impressed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe faction messages continued until we all died and<br/>\nthen the orcs stopped spawning around us<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Perhaps a Princess...&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been quite lucky.
