Take a right after going through that<br/>\ndoor and you&#39;ll come to a vendor at a counter who is the bank.<br/>\nDo not explore the prison area unless you are fairly high<br/>\nlevel.  The prisoners are not locked up, and will attack you<br/>\nif you get too close.  The guards will not attack them.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
