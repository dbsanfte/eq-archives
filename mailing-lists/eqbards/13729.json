I was in SRo the other<br/>\nday helping someone to get the Brazen Brass Kilj plans.  When we arrived,<br/>\nthere were no giants around plus nobody else camping them.  My group killed<br/>\nall kinds of lower level mobs in hopes of getting giants to spawn.  We spent<br/>\nover an hour and all we ever got was one giant.  We gave up at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Actually, they nerfed the spawn of these guys.  Last night<br/>\n&gt; Karana rebooted and I was the first player in Oasis (the<br/>\n&gt; server selection screen said &quot;Karana 0&quot;).  I ran around the<br/>\n&gt; zone and was only able to find 4 giants, 2 near the SRo zone.  <br/>\n&gt; If you were playing in Oasis back around May/June, you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; recall times when there were as many as 8 giants on your<br/>\n&gt; screen at once.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the patch messages, their rationale for nerfing the spawn<br/>\n&gt; was complaints about too many giants/griffins crashing folks<br/>\n&gt; killing orcs and gators.  It happened shortly after the<br/>\n&gt; fanfare about the first player to reach level 50 though.  So I<br/>\n&gt; have to wonder if this wasn&#39;t typical Verant double speak, and<br/>\n&gt; their real intent was to give the higher level folks fewer<br/>\n&gt; things to hunt to slow down their leveling.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
