I am currently lvl 18.<br/>\nWhen I twist the chant with lvl 7 song my attack went up by 20 (not dmg) and<br/>\nmy ac went up by 6 and str and dex too.  When I tested this out with a orc<br/>\nwarrior last night when I was lvl 17 it was very red to me.  It used to be<br/>\nthat a orc would do like 40 dmg per hit but with these 2 songs combine it<br/>\nwas doing like 2 -10 dmg per swing to me.  Sometime a 40 dmg but very rare.<br/>\nit is just too bad that it is red to me that my piercing cannot do that much<br/>\ndmg too it.  I like other plp,  just start to realized how cool the new dirk<br/>\nis.  I can hit 3 or four times per tick with a dirk in primary and a combine<br/>\nls in secondary when playing the 2 songs mention above.  Now I twist the<br/>\nchant then Warsong then the Bellow.  This is so cool.  I loved the bard.  It<br/>\nis the most fun class.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Samiam<br/>\nChampions of Norrath, The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
