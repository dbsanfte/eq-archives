Our<br/>\nschedules just don&#39;t allow us to play more than twice a week on average,<br/>\nonce for 2 hours maybe and once for 3-4.  Getting those times to mesh is<br/>\ngenerally fairly tough.  As a bard I&#39;ve found that grouping with strangers =<br/>\ninstant multiple deaths 90% of the time.  I haven&#39;t been in a group other<br/>\nthan guildmates that has worked out for 4 levels now.  That&#39;s since October.<br/>\nI tried one week before last and died on the first pull.  That&#39;s my biggest<br/>\ncomplaint about bards.  If a pull goes bad we are nearly always the one that<br/>\npays for it which tells me that our skills do not balance out with the<br/>\ndangers we face as well as any other class.  Even with reduced taunt from<br/>\nour songs the only time mobs stop hitting me even now is when either our<br/>\nenchanter uses multiple mega taunt spells or one the ranger actually gets a<br/>\ntaunt to turn it (very rare).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 17, 2000 2:56 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Worldly Issues & &quot;Play Nice&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 17 Mar 2000, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem I was addressing mainly was that due to the limitations I play<br/>\n&gt; under as a casual player, I can only play long enough to see some named<br/>\n&gt; spawns spawn twice about once every two weeks.  If the spawn is more than<br/>\n45<br/>\n&gt; minutes apart, letting my group share any night at every other spawn means<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re in luck then, as the longest regular respawn time I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen (excluding the multi-hour and multi-day respawns) is only<br/>\n40 minutes.  In fact, most of the ones your level are like<br/>\n15-20 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; able to fight the spawn once, rarely twice.  This pretty much locks us out<br/>\n&gt; of any chance of ever getting rare drops.  We can only play with enough of<br/>\n&gt; us to do tough camps once every other week pretty much anyhow.  Giving us<br/>\n&gt; the ability to get a chance at the spawn every nite while reducing our<br/>\n&gt; ability to camp the spawn longer gains us exactly zero access, while<br/>\n&gt; reducing the access we did have.  None of my regular groupmates plays more<br/>\n&gt; than 4 times a week and those are the ones who can solo easily.  Once a<br/>\nweek<br/>\n&gt; is the most often we get more than three guildmembers together.  From our<br/>\n&gt; experience the new rules will not increase our access as casual players,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; exactly the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like your problem is you don&#39;t know enough people<br/>\nyou&#39;re willing to group with for a shot at one of these named<br/>\nmobs.  The access is there, you&#39;re just unwilling to take<br/>\nadvantage of it because of whom you choose to group with.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a variant of the problem solo players complain about -<br/>\nthat they can&#39;t really kill most of the named spawns solo<br/>\nunless it&#39;s way green to them.  This is a grouping game.  If<br/>\nyour grouping is sub-par, you&#39;re going to miss out no matter<br/>\nthe rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
