","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-918675385\">I concur with your findings - hell levels tend to insulate you from death<br/>\npenalties and getting killed by a red is less xp loss than dying to a blue<br/>\nor green.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW:  got sucked into a Paladin&#39;s quest last nite.  Go to Erud&#39;s Crossing<br/>\nand kill some damn fish. Ok, quest fishie hangs out with Killer Shark&#39;s -<br/>\nugh.  Playing a just 27 wiz, I killed the Plague Shark by chain casting my<br/>\nbig nuke but agro&#39;d the Killer who snarfed me.  Got snarfed 2 times and lost<br/>\na half of a bub and then some (lost my level too.)  P.o.&#39;d, I camped him to<br/>\nget Sylly (40 bardette) and brought her over for CR and what have you.<br/>\nSomehow she managed to get killed too but thankfully showed _very_ minimal<br/>\nXP loss.  This is due I do believe to both being in a Hell level _and_ by<br/>\ngetting killed by a red (I was told Killer Sharks are 45 mobs - and if they<br/>\nare how come the Planes players don&#39;t camp em for rebuilding xp? Ya, ya<br/>\nfighting underwater is hard.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while it&#39;s hard to gain XP in a Hell Level - it seems that each time you<br/>\nare killed - there is less loss than in other levels.  FYI - I have heard<br/>\nthat the Hell plus One levels are one-bub death penaltys for each time you<br/>\ndie - maybe only 46?  Or 41 and 46?  I don&#39;t remember 31 nor 36 to be<br/>\nparticularily bard - well, 31 was cuz I wanted 32 so badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tReece, Tom - 25IDL G4<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, January 03, 2000 1:27 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Question about experience penalty<br/>\n(OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSubjectively, it appears to me that the experience penalty<br/>\nfor<br/>\n\t\tdying is higher when something kills you that cons<br/>\ngreen/blue to you versus<br/>\n\t\tsomething killing you that cons yellow/red.
