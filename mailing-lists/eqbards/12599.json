A 20something bard - at the right camp, with<br/>\nlullaby - is a newbies first and bestest friend. My husband calls himself<br/>\npermanewbie - he tends to get really frustrated around lvl 15 and start all<br/>\nover again. Many is the time I&#39;ve used the generic bandit camp in lesser<br/>\nfaye to help lower level friends train - starting, oh...bout lvl 7 or 8 -<br/>\njust as soon as they can hit the blasted things. Pull with a bellow and<br/>\njust lullaby, bard hate at it&#39;s finest. Since they can&#39;t hit me, they can&#39;t<br/>\nhurt me - and they hardly ever switch targets to that little bug biting<br/>\ntheir backside. Can do the same thing in Crusbone.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as powerleveling is concerned, the best song that I found for doing<br/>\nso is Chains..  When I used lullaby, it didn&#39;t agro the mobs enough and they<br/>\nkilled my newbie friends over and over.  When I finally leveled high enough<br/>\nto get chains, I found out this both agros better (I can cast once on sever<br/>\ncreatures, and they&#39;ll pretty much stick on me) and I can keep them slow for<br/>\nwhen they run away.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n    ~Catnip Silentpaws~<br/>\nFeline Bardette of Vallon Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
