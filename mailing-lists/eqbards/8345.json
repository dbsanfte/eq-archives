In fact, we fought a couple of<br/>\ntimes together way back in the &quot;olden days&quot; in Misty Thicket.  However, I<br/>\nstrongly believe that Goatnatos has quite playing EQ all together, or that<br/>\nhe&#39;s moved onto another character class.  I haven&#39;t seen him in Norrath in<br/>\nover 3 months now.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven more off topic...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to make a proposal to the &quot;Concert Hall&quot; and &quot;Songs of Norrath&quot;<br/>\nto make the definitive Song Analysis.  Basically, I&#39;m going to try and<br/>\nconvince everyone to send me their analysis of the songs and then I&#39;ll try<br/>\nto mush them all together.  Might need someone to help me put it into HTML<br/>\nformat.  I was also considering trying to slap together a definitive Bard<br/>\nGuide as well.... I see so many great tips, tricks, twists, strategies, etc,<br/>\netc - It would be nice to get them all together.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 28 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jens Ameskamp [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ngollon@...\">ngollon@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 08, 1999 8:46 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Song Analysis?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jens Ameskamp &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ngollon@...\">ngollon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHoi!<br/>\n<br/>\nI own an old copy of :<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                   Bard Song Spell<br/>\nAnalysis: v2.0<br/>\n                                             Courtesy of Goatnatos, of<br/>\nthe Povar server<br/>\nHmm... does anybody here know, where I can get the new version of this?<br/>\nI don&#39;&#39;t remember where I got it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTilolian<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
