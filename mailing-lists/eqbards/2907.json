Use your fists, attack 3 to 4 low level critters in <br/>\n&gt; misty, bring them near the tower.  The deputy will come out and HELP you <br/>\n&gt; kill the critters.

Now the deputy will WALK back to the tower.  You, on the <br/>\n&gt; other hand, will RUN back with selo and drum.  Attack the little thief, and <br/>\n&gt; bring him away from the tower to kill.

I<br/>\nhad _just_ gotten done lamenting all but the one undead I wanted to deal<br/>\nwith (all 3 were blue to yellow for me), and someone came up and pulled<br/>\nthe blue away just as I came up.

I ended up with the yellow<br/>\nchasing me back to the guards (thank goodness I fire up selo as I&#39;m<br/>\nrunning in--never know when a ghoul pops).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 copper,<br/>\n<br/>\nGrei, Bard of the 11th Measure<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.
