Generally speaking of<br/>\nyou word your petition politely they&#39;ll be a LOT more likely to help you<br/>\nthan if you&#39;re rude or sarcastic ;)  It also helps if you&#39;re actually nice<br/>\nto them when they show up and don&#39;t complain about how long it takes ;)<br/>\nGuides are EXTREMELY busy ;)  Do the math:  1 or 2 guides online, 2000<br/>\nplayers online.  Average Guide Petition Queue:  40+, average resolution<br/>\ntime:  5-10 minutes.  #petitions per hour:  40 at peak time<br/>\n<br/>\n(yes, I used to be a Senior Guide)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see they get burried pretty fast.  I remember when the game first<br/>\nwent &#39;live&#39; we used to see queue&#39;s of over 300 petitions with 1 guide<br/>\nonline.  NOT fun.  And an angry player generally got very cursory help<br/>\nbecause the guide was already frustrated by the sheer volume of calls.  We<br/>\nlost a LOT of guides in those days.  It&#39;s still a problem.  People just<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand that there is no way 1 person can keep up with 2000<br/>\npeople&#39;s problems in any kind of timely manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nTips for best results when working with a guide:<br/>\n1)  Do not quote the rules to them.  They already know the rules (likely<br/>\nbetter than you ever will)<br/>\n2)  Be nice<br/>\n3)  Do not ask questions or make statements about how long it took them to<br/>\nget to you.<br/>\n4)  No matter what the result of your petition wish them a good evening and<br/>\ntell them you hope the Queue remains low.  (They WILL remember you, trust<br/>\nme)<br/>\n5)  When you&#39;re on and DONT have a problem occasionally put in a petition<br/>\nthat just says &quot;Hey hope you&#39;re having a great night!  Sorry you gotta guide<br/>\ninstead of play&quot; or something like that.  Don&#39;t SPAM them with em but trust<br/>\nme!  You will be remembered.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that some people get preferential treatment.  I am saying<br/>\nthat if they know you as a complainer they&#39;re less likely to take you at<br/>\nyour word than they are if they know you as a friendly person that doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncomplain much and is understanding of their situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath since Beta 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --- Big Daddy Legba &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.
