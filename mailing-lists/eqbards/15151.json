A bardic friend of mine mentioned to me that<br/>\nthere was a discussion going on about EBW vs Ykesha<br/>\nwith actual log files involved! :)  I only read over 4<br/>\nor 5 digests here so please forgive me if I bring up<br/>\nsomething already mentioned.  John is there any way<br/>\nyou&#39;d be able to make the log data itself available,<br/>\nposted or emailed to me directly?  Allow me to<br/>\nelaborate on why I&#39;m looking for this information...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we&#39;re going to evaluate two weapons (ykesha 8/24<br/>\nwith proc and EBW 7/21 no proc) i&#39;d like to get the<br/>\nmost accurate representation of damage over time the<br/>\nweapons deal out.  There appears to be a damage bonus<br/>\nfor the primary hand of (level-25)/3, or 8 points at<br/>\nlevel 50.  This 8 points is applied more often the<br/>\nfaster the weapon swings and hence favors the faster<br/>\nweapon given the same dmg/delay ratio.  Looking at<br/>\nlogged data we see a modal spike at the &quot;magic number&quot;<br/>\n(MN) which is 2*dmg + dmg bonus.  This leads me to use<br/>\nMN/delay as the comparison at this time.  However,<br/>\nthis isn&#39;t really a good approximation of the damage<br/>\ncurve.  SO what I&#39;m getting at is I&#39;d like the log<br/>\ndata in its raw form to see if I can figure anything<br/>\nout usefull from playing around with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk ok ok I get bored at work! :)  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n-David<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
