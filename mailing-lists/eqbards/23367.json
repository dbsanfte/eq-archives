My<br/>\nregular group of friends I group with don&#39;t want me to fall to far behind on xp<br/>\nwhile I am out for my son&#39;s impending birth (my wife would kill me if I attempt<br/>\nto play for the first month).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was told that with the new xp changes that you can group with a higher level<br/>\nplayer in my case a 53 shaman whose toons I group with would take my bard and<br/>\ngroup. He would then procedd to solo mobs and let me get the xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe figures I saw (in an email) says the lower level character could &quot;draft&quot; or<br/>\nride the xp off of the higher level shaman.  They are estimating the lower level<br/>\nwould get about 40% of the xp from such a scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpinions on powerleviling and recent discussion on mediocre players aside (I<br/>\nhave played EQ since it came out and have several characters in the 20&#39;s and<br/>\n30&#39;s) would this form of powerleveling be an option? Or is the math wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any input.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ranian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
