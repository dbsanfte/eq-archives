If<br/>\nyou give it to Tommy TwoTone or whatever his name is (the guy who gives<br/>\nyou the pouch for the Freeport to Kelethin run), you&#39;ll get the money<br/>\nand experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that there are two types of quests, from hub city to hub city<br/>\nwhich use the mail pouches and from sattelite to hub which use letters.<br/>\nThe hub vendors deliver to each other and the satellites deliver to a<br/>\nhub.  Felicity is a satelite (cause she gives you a letter) and Two-<br/>\nTone is a hub.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always seem to get 9 gp for a hub delivery, but maybe I haven;t done<br/>\nenough of them yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe strange thing is after making a hub delivery, the Kelethin and Freeport<br/>\nhub people both say &quot;ask my wife Eve if you want to deliver more mail&quot;,<br/>\neven the Kelethin hub who is a female wood elf.  Funny...<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess the quest needs a bit more work.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Luvas of Fennin Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
