Perhaps I missed it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was reposted on Caster&#39; Realm.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=2800\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=2800</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExcerpt:<br/>\n<br/>\nGrollerDaBard: My expectation, especially in a class based situation, would be at least ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE for EVERY CLASS.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very obvious that no matter how hard you, Absor, or any other person tries, they cannot know everything about every class. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbashi: That&#39;s certainly a fact, and your assertion has merit. Can we agree though that no matter how much someone knows about a class that they are likely to want things for that class that are in conflict with something wanted by <br/>\nanother? It doesn&#39;t take an intimate knowledge of every class to know that will not work out. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have resources here. In fact today we had one of our own in-house &#39;crazy bard&#39; (by crazy I mean every bit as much of a passionate player as anyone else) up in the development area all day going over issues with the class. We got a <br/>\nlot of useful information out of it, of course at the same time we got suggestions that would be in conflict with the game as a whole. <br/>\n<br/>\nGrollerDaBard: Let&#39;s take Bards for instance (just cause I follow their issues more then other classes) I know Bards would be ecstatic to have a single person who is there only to respond to their issues. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbashi: A posting representative of every class however is not something that we&#39;d do. Keep in mind that we have to try and speak in a unified voice, and that cannot be done if we have 14 class-reps out here all posting their thoughts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo<br/>\n55 Bard of Deadly Virtues<br/>\nMithaniel Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
