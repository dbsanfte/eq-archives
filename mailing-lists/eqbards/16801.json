I<br/>\nfail to understand the mentality that so many players have that &quot;You&#39;re a<br/>\nfool because you sold that item for XYZ coins!&quot;  It&#39;s his business and he<br/>\nhad his reasons.  Picking on him is just going to make him feel put upon and<br/>\nput down on.  He chose to do it, it&#39;s over.  He knows he could have made<br/>\nmore money.<br/>\n<br/>\nPicking on him about it really is out of line.  Especially when I&#39;m sure<br/>\neach of us, at one time or another, has made a stupid sale or trade.   I<br/>\nstill remember my bonehead self trading a Bloodstained Tunic for a EXEC hood<br/>\nonce.   Then I found out that the BS Tunic had gone up in price to almost<br/>\n1000 pp (this was when rubicite was still in the game and a BS Tunic went<br/>\nfor 900-1200pp)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 24, 2000 5:06 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Slashing weapons for bards question...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 24 Mar 2000, Ryan Honeyman wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not too concerned if I couldn&#39;t have gotten more out of it.

Don&#39;t feel bad if you are asking more than what you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   think the worth of something is, regardless of how easy it was to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   acquire.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree with Harmonic.  The person who bought them from you<br/>\n&gt; for 7pp was laughing all the way to the bank.  7pp is spare<br/>\n&gt; change for anyone L35+.  Heck, I give 5pp for binds because<br/>\n&gt; plat is so easy to come by.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I changed my bind point from North Freeport to West Freeport.<br/>\n&gt; Now when I die, I run over to EC and kill bears while waiting<br/>\n&gt; for a res.
