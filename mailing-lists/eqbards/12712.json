This<br/>\n&gt;is a discussion group relating to bard issues, not guild/server<br/>\n&gt;politics. Although it&#39;s great to exchange thoughts on dragon raids, I<br/>\n&gt;feel discussing politics pertaining to Innoruk/Veeshan, who is a KSer,<br/>\n&gt;etc. aren&#39;t what eqbards is about. I only point this out because I<br/>\n&gt;logged onto my e-mail this evening and received 191 e-mails since<br/>\n&gt;yesterday evening, and the majority seem to be complaints about some<br/>\n&gt;guild on Innoruk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please keep discussions relating to the Bard class. If you feel a need<br/>\n&gt;to discuss server politics, EQ Vault hosts a very nice series of<br/>\n&gt;server-specific boards where issues of this nature may be addressed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ariell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Re: [eqbards] Cazic Thule slain on Innoruuk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hehehe wow someone who knows who FoH is.
