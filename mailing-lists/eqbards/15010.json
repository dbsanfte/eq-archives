I found a young <br/>\nbard named Atonal, L16 and just going to get the Ayre. He was a helpful <br/>\nyoung man and so when the corpse recovery was called off due to the victim <br/>\ngetting rez&#39;ed by a wandering cleric, we struck up a friendship. Many <br/>\nlambent stones were poofing as there were no bards in the Mtns responding to <br/>\nour shouts so he came out and picked one up. Btw bards on Xegony, if /who <br/>\nall Brilinnia is in Rathe mtns, good chance lambents stones are going to <br/>\nwaste, feel free to ask to come pick one up.<br/>\nNext day Xegony tops 100 players in LG and Atonal is not busy, so I explain <br/>\nto him where to come to wait to loot shin greaves and gaunts. Next thing I <br/>\nknow, some of my L50ish guildmates have slipped him into the assassin room <br/>\nwhere there were camping for TBB&#39;s and masks not wanted. He never got a mask <br/>\nsince it didn&#39;t respawn but they tried for over 12 hrs.<br/>\nI advised him to join this list too. I really enjoy helping out lower level <br/>\nplayers with advice and probably will pass down some of my old equipment <br/>\nlike elfhides. I don&#39;t like the trend in beggars so I am in and out of bank <br/>\nzones fast. But I don&#39;t like the image of &#39;high levels&#39; being aloof and too <br/>\nbusy to talk. I never go anony or RP, meaning I am willing to answer any <br/>\nserious questions from anyone. Just ask me twice if I don&#39;t answer the first <br/>\ntime, spam being what it is in battle sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe  (Finally L39!)<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony server<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
