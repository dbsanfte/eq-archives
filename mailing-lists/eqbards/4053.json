Because it doesn&#39;t take THAT much time to get (a few hours off-peak),<br/>\nand with  deflation so rampant, a full suit of (small) bronze, a Dirk, and a<br/>\ngood secondary weapon won&#39;t even add up to 150, which will save you MUCH<br/>\nmore time than that over the next 15 levels. You can also trade it, even up,<br/>\nfor a demon claw or a battle drum, both of which are much more valuable to a<br/>\nbard.<br/>\nYes, it&#39;s a very nice piece of equipment, but it&#39;s not worth the 50+ extra<br/>\nAC and the 50+ extra attack you can get with only *half* of it. Sell it, and<br/>\nget one at level 25 when you want another one- or simply buy one. Paying 250<br/>\npp at level 25 is very different from having that amount at 11, even if you<br/>\nhave to wait a couple of more days.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrudo (E&#39;ci)<br/>\nAdar (Racewar)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 21 Jul 1999 01:46:56 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tim and Mary Steed&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timandmary@...\">timandmary@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Blackened Iron Armor *SPOILER* (sort of)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On Tue, 20 Jul 1999, Jesse wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Do I keep it, or sell it and go on a crazy buying spree with<br/>\n&gt; the money?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;d personally keep it. If you do sell it, you&#39;ll probably<br/>\n&gt; find yourself<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; going to runnyeye in 10-20 levels to go get it again. It may not seem<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; useful right now, since you&#39;re not fighting that many spellcaster, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that&#39;ll change pretty quickly. =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;d tend to concur.  The crown is a very nice item.  250pp may<br/>\n&gt; &gt;seem like a lot at your level, but it isn&#39;t really that much<br/>\n&gt; &gt;later on.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s still a sizable sum in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your mid 20s, but it&#39;s &quot;I just have to save up for it,&quot; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;I&#39;m never gonna be able to afford that.&quot;  Most folks in their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;30s tell me they have over a thousand pp and nothing to spend<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it on (I&#39;d be close to that except I&#39;m spending it on small<br/>\n&gt; &gt;steel plate).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;You should be able to trade the crown for a nice item if the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;+resists don&#39;t really get you excited (I don&#39;t think they help<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bards as much since we get a whole slew of resist raising<br/>\n&gt; &gt;songs that are more effective than the spells).  Like maybe a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;battle drum.  :-)  The crown is just into the difficult-to-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;obtain range where high level folks will make trade-only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;trades for it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The crown is on my L28 bard&#39;s list of items I&#39;d like to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if you&#39;re curious how desirable it is.<br/>\n&gt; =================================================<br/>\n&gt; I concur with John<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am level 35, and I JUST got the Blackened Iron Crown. It is<br/>\n&gt; GREAT. I spent<br/>\n&gt; hours at this level with another friend camping the King. Got the<br/>\n&gt; Grotesque<br/>\n&gt; Mask about 4 times before we got the crown. Then, I left. I didn&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; feel bad, as I didn&#39;t get ANY XP for the whole venture, and I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t see ANY<br/>\n&gt; other groups come in and complain. I got what I needed, and took off. No<br/>\n&gt; farming for me, thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, the crown is sweet. AC 5, +5 STR, and +5 to all resists. Man, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; REALLY nice!!!  Keep it, you won&#39;t be sorry!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tallonn - 35th Verse<br/>\n&gt; Bertox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; _____________<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; _____________<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
