(Unfortunately, she didn&#39;t<br/>\njoin us until after the hour.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does this mean for the bard?  It means in a multi-giant<br/>\npull, if your group(s) does the everyone-attack-one-mob<br/>\nstrategy, ALL the extra giants will be attacking THE BARD<br/>\nafter a couple rounds.  I think I sucked up about 75% of the<br/>\nheals, just like old days with Lullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t get a chance to try varying strategies, but I<br/>\nsuspect having one tank (someone with parry and riposte) per<br/>\nextra giant would save the clerics a lot of mana.  Another<br/>\noption may be rooting the extras some distance away (assuming<br/>\nthey can be rooted).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
