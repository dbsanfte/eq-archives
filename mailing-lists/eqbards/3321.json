(Prexus Server)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still using my trusty Scimitar, and I have tried a Mino Axe, but<br/>\nhave found that while the large damage is nice, it is kinda slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have enough money to get a Combine Scimitar, but seeing as it is<br/>\njust a magic upgrade (and one speed) to the Scimitar, I have held<br/>\noff.  I have seen the Swashbuckler with his 200pp+ weapons, and I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to decide if it is worth saving money for those Well-Balanced<br/>\nweapons or a Demon&#39;s Claw / Dragoon&#39;s Dirk if I come across them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow resaleable are the well balanced weapons?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd where should I hang around to hear auctions on Dragoon&#39;s Dirk? <br/>\nGreater Faydark near Crushbone?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n_oO*  John Buenavides  *Oo_</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
