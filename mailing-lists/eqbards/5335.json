The song<br/>\napparently increases the screen refresh rate on the mana bar but the actual<br/>\namount of mana regenerated over time is always the same.  All it does is<br/>\ncreate the illusion that mana is regenerating faster.   <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Your mage friend will love jig for the mana replenishing aspects it has </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
