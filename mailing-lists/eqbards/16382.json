It was a LONG time ago.<br/>\nBut I can remember the complaints on Druid&#39;s Grove about it not<br/>\nworking, people trying everything, and nothing seemed to<br/>\nmake the spell worth anything. Then, there were discussions -- with<br/>\nGZ I think? and people started trying again. And suddenly it<br/>\nwas working. (Verant never said they fixed anything... but<br/>\nsome druids swore they had tried what eventually ended up being the<br/>\nway to use the spell.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that is a long time for him not to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Kimes, Dean W.
