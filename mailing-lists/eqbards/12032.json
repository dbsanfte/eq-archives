He gives<br/>\nyou a generic message, but nothing more. However, if you ask him &quot;what<br/>\nabout ronium?&quot; and have sufficient faction, he makes a secondary<br/>\nstatement with a braceketed term that yields the Sol Cauldron. Searfire<br/>\nnever mentions Ronium - the paladins in Rathe Mountains tell you to see<br/>\nSearfire about it. Also note asking things like &quot;What about armor of<br/>\nRo?&quot; What about paladin armor&quot; etc yield no results, only the speech<br/>\ntrigger &#39;Ronium&#39; brought up further conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if the same held true for the bardic weapon - perhaps<br/>\nsome NPC somewhere tells you to ask Walthin about &quot;the bard sword&quot; or<br/>\nsomething, and walthin doesn&#39;t respond to the prompt unless you ask him<br/>\nabout the specific name of the weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
