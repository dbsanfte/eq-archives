There is a spot near the<br/>\nlibrary called &quot;the loom room&quot; but the times i was there, i did not click it<br/>\nto see if it would do anything - so i guess it&#39;s entirely possible.  But<br/>\nthere are librarys in a few kunark dungeons, iirc - one in Seb as well as<br/>\nkaesora and Dalnir&#39;s iirc.
