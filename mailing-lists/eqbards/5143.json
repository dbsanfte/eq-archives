I used carrillion last night <br/>\n&gt;and it fired off on one click.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why is everyone using CCC to try to determine failures?<br/>\nYou use this song about 2% of the time you play EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think these things have little to do with failures also:<br/>\n<br/>\nLEVEL - I mean I miss on Jig constantly.  I got it 22 levels ago.<br/>\nDEX   - I gave high 90s dexerity.  It&#39;s not much, but look at all <br/>\n        the bards who said they have 140 something.<br/>\nAGI   - I have over 100 agility.  Over 100 anything is above average.<br/>\n        Again, many bards with extremely high agility miss notes.<br/>\nCHA   - I&#39;ve been shaman &#39;snake&#39; buffed with various CHA items.<br/>\n        Zero difference, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think those of you who want to do a &#39;real world&#39; test, should<br/>\ntwist anthem and hymm (a very common twist) 100 times and check<br/>\nmissed note rates.  Do not equip an instrument, pretend like you<br/>\nare fighting with weapons up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the fact that it&#39;s hard to start a song.  That&#39;s due to lack<br/>\nof the required skill or possibly if you just learned the song.<br/>\nIt&#39;s the fact that you are constantly stopping and starting songs, and <br/>\neach time a song check is made.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually end up twisting two party songs, and one target song.  This<br/>\nis also a very good test.  Try anthem, hymm, and chains or bellow.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying running from south karana bridge to lake rathe, and twist anthem<br/>\nand accelerando at the same time.  Count the misses.  I think moving<br/>\naround is when I&#39;ve seen the most misses.<br/>\n<br/>\nStanding in front of any merchant and playing CCC to test your<br/>\nfailure rate is slightly unrealistic.  So is standing in Qeynos<br/>\nclicking one song on and off over and over.  Try moving, try mixing,<br/>\ntry fighting and testing at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 25th drummer.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
