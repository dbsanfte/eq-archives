The only situations I<br/>\ncan come up with is when the group is moving someplace and everyone is<br/>\ninvisible. Pet isn&#39;t going to last long in that situation.

Next time you need to<br/>\nsee<br/>\n&gt; invis with a pet caster around see how much they enjoy recasting their pet<br/>\n&gt; when you pulse clouding to see invis.
