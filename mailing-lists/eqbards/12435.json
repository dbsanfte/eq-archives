I play on Veeshan with a lvl 50 <br/>\nnecro and run in to them ks&#39;ng me all the time on big events. My guild and a <br/>\nfew others got so sick of it we are banding together. Now FoH posted a <br/>\nmessage on Sony&#39;s message board about how there are so many high lvls on the <br/>\nservers that there need to be more planes and more dragons and what not <br/>\ncause there is going to be lots of KS&#39;ng and fighting over spawns and what <br/>\nnot. Man someone finally gets the player base to stand up to them and they <br/>\nrun whimpering with there tails between their legs. Pay back&#39;s a bi**h. <br/>\nAnyways been lurking for a couple days getting ideas just started a twink <br/>\nbard and got it up to lvl 7.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Cazic Thule slain on Innoruuk.<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 4 Jan 2000 12:06:17 -0500 (EST)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pray that the fallout from your raid is nothing like the one on Prexus.  <br/>\n&gt;The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; good feelings from the raids (Vox, Nagefen and Fear all went down in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; period of 3 days) quickly turned into animosity, arguments, cries of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; elitism, and just plain bad mojo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   It already has begun, sir.  People are crying about how they didnt<br/>\n&gt;   get invited, and all sorts of crap.  Hell, even someone sh*thead<br/>\n&gt;   from FoH posted saying Innoruuk server is a bunch of lame f*cks<br/>\n&gt;   if they think beating Cazic means anything big.  FoH is just a bunch<br/>\n&gt;   of lame pricks anyway.  Every server has this &#39;lame prick elite&#39;<br/>\n&gt;   guild, you just need to avoid them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m really really hoping the landscape changes by the time I get to <br/>\n&gt;45+...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   It&#39;s only gonna get worse.  Granted, I&#39;m new to the L50 scene... but<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m one of few L50 bards, so in a way I&#39;m kinda a new L50 in the bard<br/>\n&gt;   area, which is lacking on Innoruuk.  So many L50s out there flooding<br/>\n&gt;   up things.  Dragons wont live more than 24 hours these days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
