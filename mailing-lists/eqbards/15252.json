If the board moderator catches it, the thread will usually<br/>\nget split.  Honestly, I wish they&#39;d switch to a board that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmove threads to the top when they get responded to.  That whole<br/>\nbumping thing can get really annoying.  It invites people to just sit<br/>\nand bump the threads and not really add anything to the thread.<br/>\nWriting threads on that board is just a popularity contest.  If I had<br/>\nsomething really important that I wanted someone to read, I&#39;d email it<br/>\neither to Gordon or to Baelish rather than post it there.
