Whenever I stop a<br/>\nsong in attempt to start second song, there&#39;s a time lag when we can&#39;t yet<br/>\nsing the second one (it says &quot;You have not recovered..&quot; just like inbetween<br/>\ncasting spells). I noticed that under different circumstances, the delay<br/>\n(or the &quot;recovery period&quot;) doesn&#39;t seems to be the same.<br/>\nI noticed it when I was using my friend&#39;s computer 450MHz in the first full<br/>\nscreen mode (press F10 once from the default screen) and right after I<br/>\nstopped the first song (say CoD) I can NEARLY immediate start second one.<br/>\nThat day, I was twisting FOUR songs very happily. When I got back home, I<br/>\ntried to do it again (with 300MHz computer), i have to particularly wait<br/>\n(about one second) for the icon to show up again before i can weave in a<br/>\nsecond song. Twisting three was as much as I could do at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that delay is much less in full screen mode or maybe its<br/>\njust checked on the client machine so if u have a fast computer, you can<br/>\nstart weaving in second song a second earlier?<br/>\n<br/>\nGorson - 21st year-old Bard<br/>\nFenin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
