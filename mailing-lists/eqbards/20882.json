This<br/>\npatch adds additional displayable NPCs to the Emerald Jungle.  Please run<br/>\nthe &quot;Kunark Patch&quot; by pressing the &quot;Kunark Patch&quot; button on the bottom of<br/>\nthe patch program UI prior to entering EverQuest.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Patch Day*<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings everyone! Today&#39;s patch contains some exciting new changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n*General Enhancements*<br/>\n<br/>\n- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This means<br/>\nthat if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line long, all<br/>\nsubsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should make it a lot<br/>\neasier to pick out separate messages.<br/>\n- The spells &quot;United Resolve&quot; and &quot;Heroic Bond&quot; had their levels transposed<br/>\naccidentally.  Rather than putting them back as intended, United Resolve has<br/>\nbeen changed to Heroic Bond, which means you might have two copies of that<br/>\nspell in your spellbook.  Feel free to move one to the back.  Clerics get a<br/>\nnew group spell at 58 to compensate.<br/>\n- The Wurmslayer is now a one-handed slashing weapon.<br/>\n- The /help command will now list all /-commands available to you.<br/>\n- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure<br/>\ncaster with the same stats.  This will give those hybrids a good deal more<br/>\nmana, regardless of their stats.<br/>\n- NORENT items, items that disappear when you log out, will now show a<br/>\n&quot;NORENT&quot; tag when inspecting the item.<br/>\n- Most summoned items now have the word &quot;summoned&quot; in their name.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Changes/Fixes*<br/>\n<br/>\n- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works<br/>\n- Scaler recipe now works<br/>\n- High Elves can now use the Moss Covered Twig and Branch<br/>\n- Iksar can now wear the Crescent headband.<br/>\n- The Shintl Lowbrew quest will now work<br/>\n- The Rusty Rapier now looks like a rapier.<br/>\n- Elven Wine can now be brewed<br/>\n- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather than<br/>\npelts of quality.  This has been repaired.<br/>\n- The Guild-invite toggle in display options will now work.<br/>\n- The faction problems with the Charasis Key Quest have been resolved.<br/>\n- Many pathing errors have been repaired.<br/>\n- Repaired a bug that caused some anomalies after being charmed or feared.<br/>\n- Repaired a bug that kept the Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword<br/>\nof Xuzl from disappearing.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Dragons?*<br/>\n<br/>\nRumor has it that some new dragons have been spotted in Kunark. It should<br/>\nbe<br/>\nnoted however that the dragons can be engaged from much further away than<br/>\nis<br/>\nintended.  Rather than hold off implementing these dragons for another<br/>\nweek,<br/>\nwe&#39;ve decided to implement them now and fix the problem in the next patch.<br/>\nEnjoy :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*New Command For Tracking*<br/>\n<br/>\nNew option for those with tracking: /trackplayers. The command will work<br/>\nfor<br/>\nall players with the tracking skill.  The command has two settings:<br/>\n<br/>\n- ON: Default setting, same as it is now.  Players will show up in the<br/>\ntracking window.<br/>\n- OFF: Players will not show up in the tracking window.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Client Customizations*<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon starting EverQuest, a new file (EQCLIENT.INI) will be created in your<br/>\nEverQuest directory.  This file contains customizable settings for:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Colors for text messages in the in-game chat window<br/>\n- - Default screen viewing mode<br/>\n- - Default travel speed (run or walk)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe documentation will be included in the online manual in your EverQuest<br/>\ndirectory once the design is finalized over the next several weeks, but the<br/>\nworking document is posted below.  We felt that people would rather have<br/>\naccess to the customizations right away while we&#39;re in the process of<br/>\nbuilding them.<br/>\n<br/>\nModifying this file is optional.<br/>\n<br/>\n*EQCLIENT.INI documentation*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the<br/>\nclient. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in<br/>\ndecimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. &quot;Black&quot; (0<br/>\nred, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in Normal<br/>\nmode.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - Say<br/>\n2 - Tell<br/>\n3 - Group<br/>\n4 - Guild<br/>\n5 - OOC<br/>\n6 - Auction<br/>\n7 - Shout<br/>\n8 - Emote<br/>\n9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br/>\n10 - You hit other<br/>\n11 - Other hits you<br/>\n12 - You miss other<br/>\n13 - Other misses you<br/>\n14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br/>\n15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br/>\n18 - Default text and stuff you type<br/>\n20 - Merchant Offer Price<br/>\n21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br/>\n22 - Your death message<br/>\n23 - Others death message<br/>\n24 - Other damage other<br/>\n25 - Other miss other<br/>\n26 - /who command<br/>\n<br/>\nThe [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is<br/>\na list of valid settings:<br/>\n<br/>\nRunMode - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<br/>\nScreenMode - NORMAL for the default window view, FULL for the full view with<br/>\noverlays<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
