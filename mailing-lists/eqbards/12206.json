You can<br/>\nprobably handle green mobs without any problem right now.  At<br/>\nhigher levels, you will have to start running from them (or<br/>\ncharm/fear/chaining them).

So you&#39;ll<br/>\nprobably resort to camping a location if not a mob, and<br/>\npulling to get stuff to kill.  I find it boring too, but part<br/>\nof the fun for me is helping others get the stuff they want;<br/>\nso if they want to do this, I don&#39;t really mind helping them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can play as usual in the outdoor zones (especially<br/>\ncharming giants in Rathe), but then the campers tend to<br/>\ncomplain as you swing by every now and then with giants in tow<br/>\n(which admittedly is dangerous for them).<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are two major problems I see with the game.  Too many<br/>\nplayers, and (paradoxically) too many mobs given the amount of<br/>\nspace they&#39;re packed in (this was done to support the too many<br/>\nplayers).  As a result, any deviation from camping results in<br/>\na high probability of starting a train and/or pissing off<br/>\nother players.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
