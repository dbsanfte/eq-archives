We figure that there are probably a few <br/>\n&gt; bards out there who can cast 2 of these, but not many. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since nothing that regens mana will help bards, and they only get <br/>\n&gt; 1pt/tick back, it takes a LONG time for them to recover from singing <br/>\n&gt; this song. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve recently acquired the ability to place a song-specific recast <br/>\n&gt; time on the songs. We&#39;re considering replacing the mana requirement <br/>\n&gt; on the song with a 15 minute re-sing time. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Gordon<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Now the best and coolest websites come right to you based on your <br/>\n&gt; unique interests. eTour.com is surfing without searching. <br/>\n&gt; And, it&#39;s FREE!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3013/7/_/451022/_/956818330/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3013/7/_/451022/_/956818330/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
