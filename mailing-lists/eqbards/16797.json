Generally speaking<br/>\npeople who make a bard just to see what it&#39;s like will hate it.  It&#39;s a<br/>\nclass you either adore or you hate. To play, that is ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKudos Crier!

It&#39;s true.  I&#39;m in a high<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; guild with a lot of people that have two and some even three level 50 (or<br/>\n&gt; high 40s) characters.  I would say that around 8 people in my guild have<br/>\n&gt; confessed that they started a bard character and gave it up in their teens<br/>\n&gt; or early 20s.  &quot;I die too much.&quot;  &quot;Those songs are too big of a taunt.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t solo a bard.&quot;  &quot;I couldn&#39;t believe how few hitpoints I had.&quot;  &quot;Mana<br/>\n&gt; song at 32?  Geez that&#39;s a long wait.&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s the only character I&#39;ve ever<br/>\n&gt; started that had to run to guards from a snake at level 1. (this one was<br/>\n&gt; really said to me)&quot;  Etc., etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Playing a bard of any level is hard work and should be commended.  It&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; very fun and original class that is really unlike any of the others, but<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ve said on this list countless times, we do die a lot and generally<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; very slowly...
