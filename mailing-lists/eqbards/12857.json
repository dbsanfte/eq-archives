Many Bard tasks can be done better by<br/>\n&gt; Enchanters.  Crowd control, buffs, and mana regen are the big three.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  At some point in my career I believed that Bards were superior to<br/>\n  Enchanters in doing most of these things.  We aren&#39;t.  Don&#39;t be fooled,<br/>\n  learn early when to yield to enchanters.<br/>\n<br/>\n  (sidenote:  I think our manasong is better mana regen at higher levels)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Problem 2: Enchanters make Bard AoE songs more or less useless.  Since so many<br/>\n&gt; of our songs are AoE, our playlist is more limited than a Los Angeles Top 40<br/>\n&gt; FM station when grouping with an enchanter.  I&#39;ve just learned on this list<br/>\n&gt; that Largo does NOT wake up mezzed mobs, so I&#39;m adding that back into my<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Enchanter Hotkey&quot; bank.  That&#39;s good news.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I don&#39;t think I ever used AE songs very much in my whole career.  In a<br/>\n  nice, balanced group there is no need to attract the kind of attention<br/>\n  you are going to get with AE songs.  You will keep your cleric plenty<br/>\n  busy with the normal attention you will receive.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Problem 3: Bard invis song kills Enchanter pets / breaks charm.  Yeah, this is<br/>\n&gt; really the Bard&#39;s fault if they do this, and it can happen with other pet and<br/>\n&gt; charm classes too.  However, there is a unique problem with Enchanters.  The<br/>\n&gt; other night I got into a group in Unrest by the fountains.  One of the group<br/>\n&gt; members was a casting Troll.  &quot;Shaman,&quot; I thought to myself.  Suddenly, a<br/>\n&gt; typical Unrest train comes roaring by bearing half the house.  I kick in the<br/>\n&gt; invis song to protect the group when the message &quot;Gebaner slashes itself for<br/>\n&gt; 32000 points of damage&quot; pops up, followed by a severe reaming from the<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter who was in troll form.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  If I was ever in a high risk area, ie Permafrost, before something bad<br/>\n  was about to happen I would warn people I was going to invis.  When<br/>\n  the group formed and had pet casters, I would warn them I will invis<br/>\n  us to save our lives if something goes wrong.  (King room group fleeing<br/>\n  to zone, while we camped the Flag room)  The mana/reagent to cast a<br/>\n  pet is worth much less than the having 6 people die.  Pet casters will<br/>\n  get over it.  Enchanter pets in a dungeon is a bad idea anyway, as they<br/>\n  cannot control them.  Tell the pet casters to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Problem 4: For some reason, most Enchanters I&#39;ve grouped with are total<br/>\n&gt; jackasses.  They are constantly barking orders (usually in all caps) and<br/>\n&gt; yelling at everybody.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  This is because people are idiots.  In general, you can assume that <br/>\n  the other 5 people you are playing with know nothing about their own<br/>\n  skills let alone your skills.  Last night in a group with an enchanter,<br/>\n  two bards, a druid and me (a druid).  I got to see the other side of<br/>\n  the fence.  Enchanters have it rough, they are the groups master control<br/>\n  center.  They and the cleric control the groups movement, battle<br/>\n  actions, plans, etc.  The two bards would not assist each other and <br/>\n  insisted on fighting multiple enemies during the same encounter.  I <br/>\n  could tell the enchanter was getting irritated.  Could a few of them<br/>\n  be more polite?  Sure.  But couldn&#39;t we all?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, Enchanters are a great class.  They can enable any group<br/>\n&gt; to handle mobs that would be unattainable otherwise.  And there are some good<br/>\n&gt; apples in the bunch who can play their role well without being a jerk.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Good, knowledgable enchanters are awesome.  Poor enchanters get<br/>\n  themselves and groups killed.  Not all enchanters are good.  In<br/>\n  fact it takes a lot of research and background to play them correctly.<br/>\n  Anyone who says shit like &#39;d00d, yer fawking l33t&#39; and isn&#39;t joking<br/>\n  probably smoked up before their EQ session and will get me killed, heh.<br/>\n  No reason for d00dspeak or ALL FREAKING CAPS; take note some people here<br/>\n  need to learn that ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anybody have any tips on how a Bard and Enchanter can group together<br/>\n&gt; successfully and work with each other rather against?  Right now, whenever an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter is in my group, I feel like an underpowered tank, which is not a fun<br/>\n&gt; role to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Yield to the enchanter.  I cannot stress that enough.  Trust me, you<br/>\n  don&#39;t want the headache of managing the battle landscape.  We are<br/>\n  not fitted with the correct tools to make it happen swiftly and <br/>\n  efficiently.  Fumbling with broken lullaby, pixie striking something<br/>\n  and not getting it to work, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\n  So what good are we?  Bards, that is...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Enchanters are not this unlimited crowd controlling, superbuffing,<br/>\n  manaregening force.  They are plagued by mana, just like all other<br/>\n  casters.  You are much, much, much more efficient at making a party<br/>\n  work together in short notice or when the enchanter is low mana.<br/>\n  You are spur of the moment response to instant environment stimulus,<br/>\n  where the enchanter is not prepared to handle things.  You dont have<br/>\n  mana requirements, and you are usually first on the scene since you<br/>\n  don&#39;t have to med or sit down and can watch things.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Plus, enchanters cannot directly heal, nor can they run fast to flee<br/>\n  a bad situation.  We have easily 150 more ac than an enchanter, and<br/>\n  200-300 hp more than them too.  Plus we get this huge diverse weapon<br/>\n  selection to choose from which with the right ones you *can* be a <br/>\n  succussful dmg melee unit in a party despite common belief.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Enchanters have better buffs/debuffs/crowd control than we do, but<br/>\n  it all comes at a steep mana cost.  Bards and Enchanters make excellent<br/>\n  party members when coupled together.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
