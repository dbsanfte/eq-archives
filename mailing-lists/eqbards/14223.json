Bards Need your help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; As you may have noticed Aurum in all the updates there have been almost no<br/>\n&gt; fixes or bonuses to bards.  Of all classes bards do the least damage, are<br/>\n&gt; the only ones with missing spells (one per level 3 missing) have<br/>\ncompletely<br/>\n&gt; useless song (mana drain song against creatures with unlimited mana and<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t work in PVP) etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bards were promised a &quot;Archmage answers&quot; section dedicated to them 3<br/>\nalmost<br/>\n&gt; 4 weeks ago and still have not seen it.  Please Aurum, please let people<br/>\n&gt; know there is another group of people who have tried very hard to be<br/>\nsilent<br/>\n&gt; and not cause trouble that a being ignored and treated like third class<br/>\n&gt; citizens.  Look for yourself of all the responces given to the other<br/>\n&gt; classes.. by Verant and the total of 5 I can ever recall to the bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Adon Draigcanwyr Bard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
