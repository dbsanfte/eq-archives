Some sort of sado-masochist?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello, I&#39;ve been a lurker for a little while.  Now I&#39;m having a bit<br/>\nof a problem figuring out what to do<br/>\n&gt; with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby.  I know there&#39;s been a lot of<br/>\ndiscussion on the list about this song, but<br/>\n&gt; usually in relation to levels far above mine.  I&#39;ve been meaning to<br/>\nwrite this since I got the darn song,<br/>\n&gt; because I just can&#39;t figure out how to use it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First, my experience with Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament.  When I first<br/>\ngot that song it didn&#39;t work for me at<br/>\n&gt; all.  Always resisted.  Consistently got mobbed.  But as I&#39;ve<br/>\nleveled, it&#39;s become more useful.  I really<br/>\n&gt; only try to use it on blues and I&#39;m having a very good success rate<br/>\n(knock on wood).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then I get Lullaby and it&#39;s even worse than Lament was when I first<br/>\ngot it because I can&#39;t see when it<br/>\n&gt; &quot;hits&quot; them -- I&#39;m just all of a sudden surrounded.  I pick a small<br/>\ngroup of blues.  Run up and turn on<br/>\n&gt; Lullaby.  Nothing.  No &quot;resist&quot; message.  No &quot;sleepy/whatever&quot;<br/>\nmessage.  Then they&#39;re all wailing away on<br/>\n&gt; me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can someone tell me if I&#39;m doing something wrong or if this song<br/>\njust really sucks that bad?  Should I<br/>\n&gt; wait a couple (more) levels to start trying to use it?  But then I<br/>\nthought I recalled from previous<br/>\n&gt; discussion that it&#39;s completely useless after level 24? or 27?  So<br/>\nwhy bother for just a few levels of<br/>\n&gt; use?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any advice.<br/>\n&gt; Lyressa - level 17<br/>\n&gt; Nameless<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s.  If I ever run into that Kelin I&#39;m going to have to give him a<br/>\npiece of my mind.  Or maybe my foot --<br/>\n&gt; soundly on the butt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWIN A TRIP TO SPACE OR $50,000!
