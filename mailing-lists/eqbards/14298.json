Not the black helicopter truth but the QA tested truth.  This<br/>\nkind of dedication takes time and energy, most often it doesn&#39;t feel<br/>\nreciprocated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I can safely say that we like this game more than Verant does at<br/>\nthis point.  I think EQ is like Verant&#39;s teen-ager now.  It was cute and<br/>\ncuddly when it was a baby but now it is difficult, distant, frequently<br/>\ndisrespectful, but still has to be fed it and had a roof put over its head.<br/>\n;-P<br/>\n<br/>\nI respect Harmonic and his positive input to this list far outweighs our own<br/>\ninability to accept the occasional frustration that goes along with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not be able to play my bard to the degree that I am able today<br/>\nwithout the input from this list because quite simply I do not have the<br/>\ndesire to QA it, I just want to play.
