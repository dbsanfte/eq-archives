After one particular tough battle, one of the party<br/>\n&gt;&gt;members stated that the fight would have been a lot easier if he hadn&#39;t<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt;&gt;rooted the entire battle.  I then told him that had he informed the group<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that he was rooted, Roop or I could have easily broken him free with<br/>\nSelo&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually, I thought that Selo&#39;s only broke a root spell on the bard who<br/>\n&gt;sings it, not on the party members. Any confirmation on this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, you&#39;re absolutely right about multiple bards in a group. Also, an<br/>\n&gt;entire group of bards is pretty interesting in a fight when you get to the<br/>\n&gt;lvl 15 and above range. You MUST coordinate your songs, but if you take the<br/>\n&gt;time to do so, you can do some amazing things in combat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One fun thing to try with a group of two or three bards is to learn how to<br/>\n&gt;stack CoD. You CAN do this, but you have to time it so that the pulses come<br/>\n&gt;at slightly different times. If you work it right, your opponent will wince<br/>\n&gt;until he dies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Listen and Live.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Jythri duan Cliar<br/>\n&gt;Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Books, music, videos, gifts, e-cards, auctions-find them at AMAZON.COM.<br/>\n&gt;Browse Earth&#39;s Biggest Selection!
