The Butler is very good about<br/>\nremembering to unload his HT on you, fortunately he does it in the<br/>\nopening and not when you are low on hp. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Remember that what a druid can solo and what a bard can solo easily<br/>\nare two different things. The bane of the bard class is any casting<br/>\nmonster, while we can shred most lower level meleers quite easily.<br/>\nCasting classes love to burn down casters. Also ask the druid how many<br/>\nhuge trains he&#39;s pulled to the zone after messing up a pull on the<br/>\nButler, or how many times he moved to the wrong spot and had both cooks<br/>\naggro on him (assumes he is KOS in MM). Most will say none, but in fact<br/>\nthe super huge trains at the zone in MM are usually as a result of one<br/>\nhigher level player putting everyone in jeopardy instead of just dying<br/>\nquietly and peacefully. I am *not* saying your druid friend does this,<br/>\nbut maybe he does. Also, the point about the con in wolfform is<br/>\nimportant. Let&#39;s see him try fighting the &quot;easy&quot; butler in place without<br/>\nWolfform *laugh*.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
