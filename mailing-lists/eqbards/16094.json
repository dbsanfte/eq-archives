Why are bards always the ones who get<br/>\nthe short-shrift treatment if they really do have people there that play<br/>\nthem as Abashi claims?  I think its this continued treatment that points out<br/>\nthat bards are a second class class in a group of second class classes<br/>\n(non-pure casters).  If bards and other hybrids are really so well balanced<br/>\nwith the pure caster classes like necromancers and druids to name the worst<br/>\nexamples, then what secret strategies are there that we must all be missing<br/>\nthat makes them so?  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, our guild has two necros, both have a played days to level ratio far<br/>\nbetter than any other class in the guild.  Both can solo low reds with<br/>\nlittle fear.  Both can take on things that I and my nearest fellow bard have<br/>\ntrouble taking on when we group.  Adding either of the necros to one of our<br/>\ngroups has proved equivalent to adding any two other characters of similar<br/>\nlevels.  If this isn&#39;t imbalance, what the heck is it?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 14, 2000 2:37 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Kunark Expansion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Mar 14/00, Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;   ...Songs were missing in beta, and never made it in.
