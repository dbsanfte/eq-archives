(thus dangerous since it attracts a lot of attention.)  Only <br/>\n     now at 20th level am I finding it useful.  It is great at crowd <br/>\n     control when you have a large pull of which several are blue/green.  <br/>\n     If (a big if) every one concentrates on the most dangerous mob (also <br/>\n     the one most likely to resist) you have a good chance of lulling the <br/>\n     blue green mobs.  They will still break out and hit you every once and <br/>\n     a while but it works fairly well.  You do need to continually recast <br/>\n     it over and over.  I don&#39;t try to weave at all when I am doing this.  <br/>\n     So, I would advise not using it till you are higher level.  You might <br/>\n     try it at around 18th since I had given up on it and didn&#39;t even try <br/>\n     using it again till 20th.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold<br/>\n     xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Proper use of Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullabye<br/>\nAuthor:  Non-HP-ambient (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ambient@...\">ambient@...</a>) at HP-ColSprings,mimegw5<br/>\nDate:    9/17/99 2:37 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Andrea Oddo&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ambient@...\">ambient@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n     <br/>\nHi All,<br/>\n     <br/>\nThis is my first posting to the list and I was hoping by coming out of lurk <br/>\nmode I might get some help from some of the elder bards here. I recently <br/>\nattained my 15th level and ran to the bards guild in Kelethin to get <br/>\nKellin&#39;s Lucid Lullabye.  I went to www.harpers.net and took a look at the <br/>\nwriteup for this song. I am not sure of the proper usage for this song. How <br/>\nshould I use it say if I were approaching a dervish camp (like the one in <br/>\nOasis) with my group as opposed to using it in Unrest?  I did approach a few <br/>\nbards who were over level 17 asking how exactly they used the song and I was <br/>\ntold on 2 occasions that they had gotten into more trouble than it was worth <br/>\nwith this song and not to use it.  After lurking on this list for the last <br/>\ncouple of weeks it seems that there are plenty of you out there who know how <br/>\nto make this song work to your advantage and I&#39;d like to know how I should <br/>\napproach this song.<br/>\n     <br/>\nThank you in advance for any help you can give me. I am very very happy <br/>\nplaying my bard and can&#39;t see myself playing any other character. But then <br/>\nagain, maybe I&#39;m just a wood elf in human&#39;s clothing =)<br/>\n     <br/>\nToxia<br/>\nBard 15th Circle, Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
