I started on Xegony the week the game went<br/>\npublic - and I never begged and don&#39;t recall people begging.  I find it<br/>\nquite common.  People begging for cash particularly bug me.  On the other<br/>\nhand - I had a level 6 bard (I&#39;m 19) ask me very nicely I had any armor I<br/>\ncould spare.  I did in fact have some stuff in the bank that I was too lazy<br/>\nto try to sell - so I figured, what the hey - I&#39;ll help this guy out...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\n&lt;Army of Virtue&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sean Gifford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:giffords@...\">giffords@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 9:06 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Side effect/Symptom of twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Sean Gifford&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:giffords@...\">giffords@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One thing that I find, that I assume is related to twinking,  is low level<br/>\n&gt; characters, begging for money or Items.  Probably because their previous<br/>\n&gt; character was twinked by some high level char and they didn&#39;t have to work<br/>\n&gt; hard to get up in the world.  And then they either moved servers, or<br/>\ndeleted<br/>\n&gt; their previous char and no one has come and thrown 100plat their way.<br/>\n&gt; anyone else notice this begging?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gleeman, Bard of the 15th chorus - Karana </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
