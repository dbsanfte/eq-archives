I had fear<br/>\nplaying the whole time and I was seriously pissing everyone off.  -=)  It<br/>\nwas resisted a good bit, but when you do it over and over chances are one<br/>\nwill hit.  I will say that a LOT of songs are resisted 80 to 90 percent<br/>\nnowadays for me (lv 34 still) by PCs and NPCs.  Now that warriors have a<br/>\nhigh base magic resistance (Sendog&#39;s is 70 at lv 49) I&#39;m starting to think<br/>\nthey&#39;re the wave of the future.  I&#39;ve used the chain/fear combo a few times<br/>\nand it&#39;s unreliable at best, but it&#39;s still a great combo.  Even if they do<br/>\nthe sit down bug they are still fighting their own fear, and it&#39;s difficult<br/>\nto turn around and fight, or cast, since you end up moving again very<br/>\nshortly.  As for pvp tactics against multiple people, best i can think of is<br/>\nthe dirge.  But really, anyway you cut it, 3 wizards gather around you and<br/>\ncast on you, you&#39;re dead before you can get a song off.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
