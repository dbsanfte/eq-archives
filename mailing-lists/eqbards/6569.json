So you can leave it<br/>\nrunning, restart it every time it stops, or you can weave it<br/>\nwith others songs.  It is most effective when you stop it and<br/>\nrestart it every pulse (shortens the time between pulses from<br/>\n6 seconds to about 3.5 seconds - vital for interrupting<br/>\ncasters). If the situation is not that bad, you can relax for<br/>\na change and just leave it running.  If the situation is even<br/>\nmore in hand, you can weave it with another song (I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nrecommend two).  Sometimes in the right circumstances, I&#39;ll<br/>\nweave it with a song in bad situations - e.g. to heal when the<br/>\ncleric goes OOM and everyone has taken damage, or buff our<br/>\nmagic resist when we&#39;re being hit by a caster.  Higher level<br/>\nmobs break out of it more quickly so make sure you group kills<br/>\nthem first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe song does not seem to work very well at L15, but gets<br/>\nbetter quickly.  Around L17 you&#39;ll wonder how you ever lived<br/>\nwithout it.  Lately though at L34 I&#39;m finding mobs break out<br/>\nof it much more often than I remember from my youth.  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure if this is due to a general nerfing of the song, or if<br/>\nthe increased toughness of higher level blue-con mobs is the<br/>\ncause.  It works better if you have a lute equipped at L34,<br/>\nthough I don&#39;t remember a lute making that big a difference at<br/>\nL17.  Charisma is supposed to help too, though nobody has been<br/>\nable to quantify it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you get Pixie Strike at L28, you&#39;ll find Strike is more<br/>\nrelabile at holding 1-2 mobs.  The enchanter&#39;s mesmerize is<br/>\nalso preferable for this reason.  But if you ever get into a<br/>\nsituation with 4+ mobs and the enchanter can&#39;t/is afraid to<br/>\narea effect mesmerize, this song will save your butts.  The<br/>\nmain problem seems to be if you group regularly with the same<br/>\npeople, they get used to this song letting them tackle trains,<br/>\nand when you&#39;re not with them they may try to do the same<br/>\nthing and die quickly.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe song is also great at getting mobs off your casters.  It<br/>\ndoes *not* clear the hate list, but it does make them hate you<br/>\nmore rather quickly, which is ok since we&#39;re decent tanks.<br/>\nWhile they&#39;re nodding, they&#39;re not interrupting the caster&#39;s<br/>\nspells, so your friends will be able to cast more reliably.  <br/>\nMy cleric friend loves this song because without it in<br/>\nmultiple mob situations, the unengaged mobs tend to jump on<br/>\nthe her after she heals anyone.  She says if that happens, she<br/>\njust stands next to me for a few pulses and the mobs start<br/>\nattacking me again.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
