I think it would<br/>\nhopefully start a chain reaction of events on the server, and would also be<br/>\na good time with lots of laughs for all in attendance.<br/>\nhere&#39;s the list of people i am looking for :<br/>\na drummer (any lvl 5 and up bard)<br/>\na bassist (any lvl 8 and up bard)<br/>\na lead singer (any bard of any level who can type fast and accurately and<br/>\nplease a crowd :)<br/>\na Introducer (&quot;And now, live from the Freeport Amphitheater, the<br/>\nLutesmashers!&quot;)<br/>\nanyone with humorous/interesting song ideas<br/>\na couple people to RP security guards or roadies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, thats all.. i really hope this will be successful, i am tired of<br/>\nreading on EQVault about the other server&#39;s events and there are NONE on<br/>\nFennin , this should give the other guys something to be jealous about :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kyar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
