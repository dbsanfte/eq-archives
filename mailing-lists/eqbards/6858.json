We can solo Darters and<br/>\n&gt;Rooks, and in groups we can take harriers and Avocets, these things are <br/>\n&gt;rich<br/>\n&gt;also.

I made 23d<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level a week ago. Since then, I have died and gone back to 22d level <br/>\n&gt;three<br/>\n&gt; &gt;times. Finally made it back to 23d yesterday but my progress towards 24th<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level is going extremely slow.  Its like taking two steps backward for<br/>\n&gt;every<br/>\n&gt; &gt;one step forward.  My tactics, gained from reading this list, haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;changed so it has to be something else.  A couple of times my death has<br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt; &gt;due to being in a bad group.  One time it was strictly my fault.  I made<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mistake of playing Denon&#39;s in the basement of HighKeep.  I wasn&#39;t getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;any messages that people were casting so I didn&#39;t think the z-axis bug<br/>\n&gt;would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;affect me.  That was a bad assumption and I got killed by the guards.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m beginning to think soloing may be good for me for the time being.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Someone mentioned soloing the aviaks in Rathe Mountains as an option.  <br/>\n&gt;Does<br/>\n&gt; &gt;anyone have any other recommendations?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions about where to go to earn solo<br/>\n&gt;experience<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at my level (24)?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Does anyone have any tactical suggestions to permit me to keep my butt<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; alive when grouped with mediocre<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; players?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I hate playing for eight hours and earning only one bubble of <br/>\n&gt;experience.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Or less.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
