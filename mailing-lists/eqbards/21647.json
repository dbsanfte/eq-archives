Next step run them to where you want them to fight. Next, charm<br/>\none (he&#39;ll start running away for some dumb reason and wont attack the<br/>\nother) turn around and run right at the non charmed giant. Voila, you now<br/>\nhave a very pissed off pet attacking another giant, keep Selo&#39;s on, your<br/>\ncharm is gonna let go soon and you&#39;re near 2 giants because you just charged<br/>\none.  Charm lets go, charm again, selo, heal, selo, recharm, selo, keep<br/>\ncharming like this untill one is dead, the other will be very weak and chant<br/>\nit to death. Go find 2 more targets. At most HP you&#39;ll lose when charging<br/>\nthe giant is 1 bub of hp (you might sweat abit if you&#39;re stunned) But i&#39;ve<br/>\nfinished alot of them with a bub of hp and didnt fear for my life. Even the<br/>\ngroup next to me was sending me tells asking if they wanted me to take one<br/>\nbecause they saw my low health, i was like hell no if you do i&#39;ll be kiting<br/>\nfor an hour. But most of the time i will have 2 dead giants and be full<br/>\nhealth. Hope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nSol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mott, Mike J.

I seem to have a<br/>\nparticulary hard time getting them targeted on each other. Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy general charm tactics are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n-\tfind a critter, charm it, fire up selos and start looking for an<br/>\nopponent<br/>\n- \tfind an opponent, recharm my pet, re-target the opponent, let my pet<br/>\nget real close to me and give it the attack order<br/>\n-\tFire selos back up....back off to maximum range..recharm as<br/>\nnecessary, doing big circles around critters if charm is resisted <br/>\n- \twhen pet is getting low on health, do a health check....helps if you<br/>\nhave critters that run when they are low on health..as the<br/>\nopponent will run if he is losing<br/>\n- \tEither chant kite, fear kite or pull out the weapons and kill the<br/>\nremaining critter if health is low enough...or find another target and send<br/>\nmy pet back into the fray.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy various problems are:<br/>\n<br/>\n-\tmy initial charm wears off to soon for my pet to make it to the<br/>\ntarget to attack, so I have to redo the entire charm, get close to pet, tell<br/>\nit to attack etc.<br/>\n-\tboth critters run at me, the pet is behind the target and the target<br/>\nkeeps running at me instead of turning to fight my pet<br/>\n-\ttargeting in general.  F8 targets the closest hostile, but what if<br/>\nboth are uncharmed?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions or do I just need to practice more?<br/>\n<br/>\nLaqo Bardoon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
