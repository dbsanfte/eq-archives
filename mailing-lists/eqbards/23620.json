I work on an average of 10-40 machines/week, most running win9x,<br/>\nwinnt, or win2k.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith ME, I&#39;ve noted a few things...<br/>\nIf you have a PC that came loaded with 98 SE, you are probably ok to<br/>\nupgrade.<br/>\nIf you have a PC that came loaded with 95, 95a, 95b, or 98 First Edition,<br/>\nDON&#39;T even mess with trying to upgrade.  Yeah, I know microsoft says it will<br/>\nwork, but you&#39;ll cause yourself more headaches than you know.  If you must<br/>\nupgrade, upgrade to 98 SE, and you&#39;ll be happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nDON&#39;T load PcAnywhere 9.x or up on ME.  Hoses up the network stack, and<br/>\ncauses lot&#39;s of little niggling errors that are impossible to get rid of. It<br/>\nworks on some machines, but not others.  If you have to use PCA, use 98SE or<br/>\nNT4.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe careful of device drivers, try not to use anything written for 95 or 98<br/>\nFE.  if it&#39;s for 98SE, you&#39;re probably ok.  I&#39;ve seen more device drivers<br/>\nwritten for the first run of 95 hose up ME machines than I&#39;d care to count.<br/>\n<br/>\nReload, either every 6 months or 1 year, and reinstall applications.  I<br/>\nknow, it takes alot of time, but is it better to have a clean running system<br/>\nthat you spend 8 or 10 hours on every 6 months doing maintenance, or one<br/>\nthat you will be fighting crashes on every other day?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Win2k, same thing applies as above, it&#39;s just a bit easier to backup<br/>\nyour stuff for reloads (docuements and settings directory is a godsend for<br/>\nthis :)  I haven&#39;t noted any major troubles with Win2k boxes unless driver<br/>\nsupport is non-existant.  Worst case i&#39;ve seen: some guy managed to get his<br/>\nto load iomega drivers from the original cd that was sent for win95.  The<br/>\nonly way to fix that box was to reload.<br/>\n<br/>\nTips for reloading:  (assumption is that you have a hard drive with a bit of<br/>\nextra space, in the range of 500mb +)<br/>\n<br/>\ncopy all the files from your cd in the win9x directory (not the other root<br/>\ndirectories, or the subdirectories, you don&#39;t need those) to your hard<br/>\ndrive, in something like c:&#92;win98 or c:&#92;win9x or something.  Make sure you<br/>\nhave a driver directory, with current drivers for all of your hardware,<br/>\nincluding modems, motherboard, video, sound, etc.  Also, make sure you have<br/>\na copy of the Internet Explorer Installation program for your favorite<br/>\nflavor (4.x, 5.0, 5.5) if you use that, or the installation file for<br/>\nnetscape (reloading will blow IE out for sure, netscape just won&#39;t run right<br/>\nuntil you reinstall it).  After you are sure everything is in place, follow<br/>\nthe next steps:<br/>\n<br/>\nScandisk<br/>\nDefrag<br/>\nreboot to safe mode MS-Dos Prompt (hit F8 when it says &#39;Starting Windows&#39;,<br/>\nyou have about 2 seconds...I usually just start hitting F8 repeatedly after<br/>\nthe memory count)<br/>\nRename your windows directory:  i.e. c:&#92;&gt;move windows win.old  (just in case<br/>\nsomething goes wrong :)<br/>\nGo into the source directory (remember the win9x files?) c:&#92;&gt;cd win98<br/>\nRun setup with /is (skip the disk check, you&#39;ve already done scandisk and<br/>\ndefrag :)  c:&#92;win98&#92;&gt;setup /is<br/>\nFill in the prompts, when it asks you what directory to install to, it will<br/>\nprompt you for Win.old, change this to Windows.<br/>\ninstall device drivers, apps, etc.  All your documents will be where they<br/>\nwere, except for email if you use Outlook Express or Outlook.  You&#39;ll need<br/>\nto import those and any favorites, cookies, shortcuts, etc. from the win.old<br/>\ndirectory (email me if you need help with this).  Once you are happy with<br/>\nthe new load and have gotten everything you need out of win.old, delete the<br/>\nwin.old directory, and you have a clean, reloaded machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have questions or doubts, please email me (i do this at least once a<br/>\nday on various machines :)<br/>\n<br/>\nwow, what a ramble...sorry about the length :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\nSolusek Ro Blood Tide<br/>\n32 Songs for the 4th time :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lora Roa&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, January 28, 2001 7:50 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] (OT) Tech problem, any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Have to agree with the multiple upgrade, no reformat (no reinstalls) - and<br/>\n&gt; believe it or not ..

I run it side by side with a Win2k Adv<br/>\n&gt; Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and have had very few problems with each.  The server has been running<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt; months now without a reboot, the WinME Machine has been outstanding for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gaming.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think what it really comes down to is this.  What are you using the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; machine for?  If its work, then security and lower TCO is most likely an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; issue and I would recommend the W2K series of OS&#39;s.  If the machine is<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personal or home use (games / ease of use / intuitiveness) , use WinME.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are two big areas that we have seen people need support on:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.  Someone has taken their machine that has gone through EVERY OS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; upgrade and has never reformatted it or just cleaned up the drive.<br/>\n(Some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; issues there)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.  Someone is taking a WinME machine and trying to make into a high<br/>\n&gt; &gt; end work production machine...it was never designed to be that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just my .02 :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Have a great day Everyone!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kendawen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, January 25, 2001 2:15 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] (OT) Tech problem, any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
