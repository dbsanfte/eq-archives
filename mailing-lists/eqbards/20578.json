If you kill enough Froglok Foragers and Hunters (level 45), <br/>\nhe or one of 11 other named mobs will spawn.  He&#39;s between 45 and 50 <br/>\n(Blue to me at 51), and he&#39;s a tough SOB to pull.  I think I died 3 <br/>\ntimes trying to coax him in, and in hindsight, I should have used <br/>\ncharm from the outset (after each rez, I obviously was limited <br/>\nthere...), but the biggest problem is all the aggro frogs in the <br/>\nzone.  Almost all are green to me at 51, but it&#39;s tough to coax in a <br/>\n45+ casting mob with 3 greens chipping at your ankles.  Selo&#39;s with <br/>\ndrum is too fast, selo&#39;s without drum is about right and just a plain <br/>\nole sow seems to work the best.  Except when he stops to nuke you. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve spent the last couple days there and it&#39;s a lot of fun.  The <br/>\nforagers and hunters spawn fast (about 5 seconds after they die), and <br/>\nwe end up seeing quite a few rares after a couple hours.  Too bad <br/>\nmany of them drop NOTHING!  I was quite pissed last night after dying <br/>\n2 or 3 times trying to pull Hierophant Lyxl, only to find he was <br/>\ncompletely empty... he must have dropped it while chasing me :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past few days we&#39;ve looted an Iksar Ceremonial BP, some <br/>\nleggings the Shaman put on, a Hangman&#39;s Noose, a Silken Cat Fur <br/>\nGirdle, and a Trak Tooth.  No spells, but not a shabby treasure hoard <br/>\nfor the time invested. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; speaking of masks, where can we get that mask? what lev the mob and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>what<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; zone? and i heard rumor of a erudite mask? sorry i been out of the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>loop and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; trying to get back in it<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Minkin<br/>\n&gt; Sol Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
