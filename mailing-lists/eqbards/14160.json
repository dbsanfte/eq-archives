Those messages should be<br/>\nin group say, not plain say imo.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant will probably never do it.  They rightly feel that building the trust<br/>\namongst players is important.  You have to get to know others well enough to<br/>\ngroup with them and trust them to tell you what loot is, which necessitates<br/>\nlong-term grouping relationships, which is a positive thing.  If you put<br/>\nthese messages in then you diminish the necessary trust relationships<br/>\nbetween players and somewhat diminish to need for long-term relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Verant continually surprises me both positively and negatively.<br/>\n<br/>\n[45 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Peck White &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peck_white@...\">peck_white@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There was a thread I read earlier but I&#39;m not sure it<br/>\n&gt; was on this list.
