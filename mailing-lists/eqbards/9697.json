As it is<br/>\n&gt;lore and heavy it is bad loot to most of the casters hunting there and thay<br/>\n&gt;willing let you loot and watch your back.

Mostly some banded still a lot of barbed,<br/>\n&gt;etc.  A few pieces of bronze.  I&#39;m at level 26 btw - so I&#39;m almost at the<br/>\n&gt;point where I can think about questing for Lambent.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    But anyway - I got to the armor store in E Freeport and look at the<br/>\n&gt;Steel Plate.  I notice that they mostly offer 1 or 2 AC points above the<br/>\n&gt;equivalent banded.  Same as Bronze with a small weight saving.  Question<br/>\n&gt;is - is it worth it?  How important is one or two AC points?  How important<br/>\n&gt;is 2 or 3 but giving up STR or whatever bonuses.  I have Blackened Iron<br/>\n&gt;Shoulders.  It says &quot;Magic Item&quot;.  What does this actually provide?  Is the<br/>\n&gt;Steel Pauldron the equivalent?  Pretty annoying you can&#39;t tell without<br/>\n&gt;buying and then you can sell it at a fraction of what you pay for it if you<br/>\n&gt;make a mistake (obviously forcing you to check website like EQualizer...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    Anyone have any other suggestions on what to spend money on?
