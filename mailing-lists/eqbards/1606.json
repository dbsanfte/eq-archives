Everyone else I&#39;ve heard has told me that it<br/>\n&gt; simply stops you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get<br/>\n&gt; stuck again if I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to pull my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;corpse away from the zone border?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You should be able to /corpse it from anywhere.  I&#39;ve even heard that now<br/>\n&gt; you can /corpse out of Lava (perhaps they increased the /corpse range).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is probably still only on the test server, like the /follow command,<br/>\nand, what I read was that you can&#39;t /corpse from lava, but you can /loot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s corpse?  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt;theory is that his corpse was not in the Butcherblock zone but<br/>\n&gt; in the Ocean<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of Tears zone.  Will the locate corpse zone still point you in the right<br/>\n&gt; &gt;direction even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you<br/>\n&gt; are looking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for?  If the other player&#39;s corpse was indeed in the Ocean of Tears zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse<br/>\n&gt; was in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more puzzling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; MAJOR bug there.  Unless his corpse was beneath the world - in which case,<br/>\n&gt; it DID lead you to him. Only his body was a million miles under you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>IF his corpse was in the OOT zone, then you should have received a message<br/>\nlike:<br/>\n&quot;There is no corpse by that identification in this zone&quot; or similar.  I&#39;ve<br/>\ngotten<br/>\nthat a few times, when a player has a) lost a corpse or b) was just confused<br/>\nabout<br/>\nwhich zone they actually died in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most likely an NPC, actually - probably one who was lost.  Possibly a Bard<br/>\n&gt; with Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre, but you&#39;d have to ask around.  FYI in weird<br/>\n&gt; situations, don&#39;t be afraid to hammer on the &quot;Screenshot&quot; key a few times.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s amazing what details you missed that you can locate later from a<br/>\n&gt; screenshot.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some NPC&#39;s don&#39;t seem to have a &#39;swimming&#39; animation.  Once, at the docks in<br/>\nFreeport, I was swimming around, and the girl that normally stands on the<br/>\nend of<br/>\nthe dock was down on the ocean floor, still fishing.  So this could have<br/>\nbeen an NPC<br/>\nthat wandered off the beaten path.  I&#39;m not real familiar with the BB zone,<br/>\nbut I<br/>\ndon&#39;t remember any wandering human or elf NPC&#39;s, at least not near the<br/>\ndocks.  There<br/>\nare some elves there at the docks though they don&#39;t seem to walk around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to /petition.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they automatically<br/>\n&gt; &gt;retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?  I sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to<br/>\n&gt; retrieve it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They will certainly retrieve his - but what I would do is petition a GM<br/>\n&gt; with the initial problem, and then offer to attempt the retrieval on your<br/>\n&gt; own, if they will watch to make sure that you do not get trapped<br/>\n&gt; again.  It<br/>\n&gt; DOES seem to be a bug, but it&#39;s not verifiable (like a corpse under the<br/>\n&gt; world is) so they will be hard pressed to prove it, and the hard rule is<br/>\n&gt; &quot;If you cannot prove it was a bug, you cannot help them.&quot;  You can mention<br/>\n&gt; to them that the reason you want them to &quot;watch over you&quot; is because the<br/>\n&gt; bug will likely cause you to die before you can /corpse your body.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh - and have you thought about using the jig o&#39; vigor to restore<br/>\n&gt; your lost<br/>\n&gt; stamina?  I never thought about it before...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh...I crashed in the OOT zone, once.  My ISP dropped out from under me,<br/>\nand<br/>\nwhen I finally got back in, I was at the ocean floor.  I swam over<br/>\nhmm...half the<br/>\nzone (I was halfway between the two dock islands).  I kept the jig going the<br/>\nentire time, and never once did my stamina bar drop.  And, my swimming skill<br/>\nwent<br/>\nfrom nearly nothing (5 or 6) to about 35 during that swim.  Pretty boring,<br/>\nactually.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good Luck and Song,<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough, Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
