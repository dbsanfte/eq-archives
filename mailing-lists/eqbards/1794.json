I now have roughly 65 skill in 1H <br/>\nslashing and find myself wanting to explore other weapon types. I am <br/>\nplanning on building my 1H blunt and piercing after reviewing the array of <br/>\n&quot;special&quot; weapons available in these areas at later levels. I equipped a <br/>\ndagger and began my task. Then I wondered about what to fight. If I fight <br/>\nblue mobs, I can&#39;t kill them fast enough without running and sometimes <br/>\nzoning if I can&#39;t get my Mino axe out in time to save my worthless hide.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume if I begin with green con mobs, my skill won&#39;t go up... Or will it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any suggestions for a strategy here?<br/>\n<br/>\nTwen - Bard - The Rathe<br/>\nDoug Donaldson                                   (250)549-2911<br/>\nService Manager                                   (250)542-4130 fax<br/>\nDoctor Electronics                                 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:doug@...\">doug@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
