Primary: Down-time reduction & over-land travel Secondary: Melee +","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1562424930\">Here is a blank sheet of &quot;paper&quot;.  Fill in what *you* think the bard should<br/>\nbe:<br/>\n<br/>\nBard<br/>\n----<br/>\nPrimary: Down-time reduction & over-land travel<br/>\nSecondary: Melee + group buffing<br/>\nTertiary: nearly everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nDown-time reduction:<br/>\nNo one, and I mean no one, is better at down time reduction then we are. Ask<br/>\nany player in, on any server, what they hate the most about the game and I<br/>\nwould bet a FBSS and a pair of yaks that downtime would be at the top of the<br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver-land Travel:<br/>\nAt lower levels group gating every where is just not an option.  We get fast<br/>\ntravel before any other class in the game.  And at upper levels we can out<br/>\nrun anything in the game.  Add to this that in the expansion there will be<br/>\nzones twice as large as West Karana and that there is only going to be one<br/>\nGG point and 2 boat docks on the new continent and this does becomes a<br/>\nvaluable addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelee:<br/>\nWe melee better then caster/priest class, but not as well as the other melee<br/>\nclasses.  Our melee damage output is not trivial, do we pump out the pain<br/>\nlike a monk? No, not with weapons at least :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup Buffing:<br/>\nAs feeble as our group buffs may seem when compared to the finger-wigglers<br/>\nthere is something important to remember.  VI has thoughtfully added, and<br/>\nkeeps adding, mobs that like to AE dispel.  Guess which group is going to do<br/>\nbetter in a case like this?<br/>\n<br/>\nNearly everything else:<br/>\nWe can do nearly everything else any other class can do, with the exception<br/>\nof Group Gating and Resurrection.  The ability to dynamically change buffs<br/>\nin a few secs is an amazing ability, not to be taken lightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall:<br/>\nI have said this numerous times, so I will say it again :)  The Bard class<br/>\nis unique in the fact that we amplify the power of the party.  The large the<br/>\nparty the more powerful the bard becomes.  No other class and ramp up as<br/>\neasily like this.  We can take ANY broken group and make it work.  We can<br/>\ntake a well-balanced group and turn it into a nearly unstoppable death<br/>\nmachine.  Playing a Bard is a lot of work, but well worth it IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------<br/>\nRo-kenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
