This started with me stealing from a<br/>\nthird player.  The Wizard jumped in and , after making her chase me to<br/>\nKithicore, I more or less conceded defeat.  But the wizard didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nend the game yet so she accused me of stealing from her too.  It&#39;s all in<br/>\nthe name of fun and she&#39;s been VERY sportsmanlike about bending the rules<br/>\nof EQ to allow a few of my moves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;ll shoot the arrow at the skeleton just before Immobilize wears<br/>\noff.  Then run for the zone.  If she allows the move, the skeleton will<br/>\neventually fall back and forget about me, but it will be in her path as she<br/>\nchases me.  I&#39;m counting on the stuns, cause she&#39;s got Jboots and I don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 13 tunes<br/>\nMead, agitator of high level casters<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                        <br/>\n                    Talies the                                          <br/>\n                    Wanderer             To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>    <br/>\n                    &lt;snicker@pink        cc:                            <br/>\n                    pig.com&gt;             Subject:     Re: [eqbards] OT  <br/>\n                                         - duel info needed             <br/>\n                    11/15/2000                                          <br/>\n                    01:16 PM                                            <br/>\n                    Please                                              <br/>\n                    respond to                                          <br/>\n                    eqbards                                             <br/>\n                                                                        <br/>\n                                                                        <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:07 PM 11/15/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Sorry this is off topic, but I know this is an active list and need a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>quick<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;answer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My level 14 rogue is engaged in a virtual duel via email with a level 45<br/>\n&gt;wizard.
