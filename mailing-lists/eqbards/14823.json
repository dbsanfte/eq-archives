Warrior = 1800 HP, hits 50 x 4  at most.<br/>\n                                            or hits 100 x 2 at most.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not telling you a lie, when I say the HG will outlast the warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In fact the delay of an HG is probably on par with about 20-25,<br/>\n  because those mofo&#39;s swing fast and hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n  No melee class has ever solo&#39;d a HG toe to toe that I&#39;ve ever heard of.<br/>\n  If someone wants to test this out or ask a L50 warrior if they are<br/>\n  willing to try it, that would be cool.  Monks? hahahahahaha, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
