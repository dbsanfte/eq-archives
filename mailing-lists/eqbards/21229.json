Is there some trick to the song?<br/>\n<br/>\nA somewhat of a tangent.  My cleric tested his cancel magic (the low lvl<br/>\none) on my roomate.  Every time I hit him, one random spell effect came off.<br/>\nI continued to get the success message (Willae looks dispelled or something)<br/>\neven when he had no buffs.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
