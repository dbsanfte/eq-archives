Sigh, if only there was an autoattack for throwing... Yes,<br/>\ndamage is terrible: 4-9 pts and YES I&#39;ve thrown my runed bone fork about 4<br/>\ntimes now, but as the lone mage in our guild can tell you - it ain&#39;t<br/>\nstopped me yet. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTargeted or not, DoTs can complicate large scale situations.  If an<br/>\nenchanter can&#39;t mes something because its DoT&#39;d the only recourse is to<br/>\ncharm it (not always a bad thing mind you).  I never target a mob manually<br/>\nin those cases, we always have a main tank whom everyone assists off of -<br/>\nhowever occasionally assist screws up by targeting a seemingly random mob<br/>\nin the zone or it targets the wrong mob because of riposite.  I always<br/>\ndouble or triple tap my /assist [main tank] hotkey just to make sure. <br/>\nBesides, with VoV/fbss and Dawnchaser/Partisan I do excellent melee damage.<br/>\n Too bad there isn&#39;t &quot;+hitroll&quot; gear or I&#39;d be really dangerous.  LoS<br/>\nreally is a different type of guild, so feel free to disreguard what I<br/>\nsay... case and point:  a wizard pulls in poh for us or we go door to door<br/>\ntrick or treating the houses because its fun.  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHum oh yeah Shada: sure 7/33 will get old BUT in EQ making a fashion<br/>\nstatement is oh so imporant.  I&#39;m trying to remember, he had blue boots,<br/>\nyellow legs/chest/arms and black head/wrists/gloves... that sound about<br/>\nright?  Wolverine Woodelf here I come. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as for RoK issues: I guess its just a matter of perspective because if<br/>\nthe rolls where reversed I sure would want the stuff I see dropping and<br/>\nprobably would try and buy it - so I don&#39;t knock anyone who disagrees with<br/>\nmy contention it should be nodrop, etc... but I hope you can see the flip<br/>\nside of that too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tork@Nameless<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: For the curious: YES I DIE A LOT! =)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
