It&#39;s been a *painfully* slow Friday.  I got<br/>\nlevel 29 last night after a wonderful few hours in Mistmoore and I&#39;m itching<br/>\nto go back and make sure it wasn&#39;t a fluke. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBringing this back OnT, I was, if you&#39;ll pardon the self pat on the back,<br/>\nabsolutely rocking last night doing crowd control.  Our Warrior pulled six<br/>\ninitiates/pledges, two of which were casters.  I hurriedly let the group<br/>\n(&#39;group&#39; hah!  Me, the warrior and a mage) know what I was doing: charmed<br/>\none caster and sic her on the other and kept the three male initiates<br/>\nmezzed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot one resist the whole time.  I took a bit of a beating as I mis-timed<br/>\nsome of the wake-ups, but overall I was very happy.  Which leads me to my<br/>\nquestion... at 28/29, Pixie Strike has been working very well.  At what<br/>\npoint does it start to degenerate into the realms of uselessness, or is it a<br/>\ngradual thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nBack OT: The weekend&#39;s looking pretty good now... just got offered tickets<br/>\nfor the first US F1 Grand Prix in Indianapolis!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
