So if you<br/>\nget into a tough situation like this, there&#39;s no reason to put<br/>\nyour main character at further risk.  Simply create a level 1<br/>\ncharacter, login with the main character and /consent to the<br/>\nlevel 1 character, then login with the level 1 character and<br/>\ngo looking for the corpse.  (This assumes of course that the<br/>\ndegree of risk is the same searching with either character -<br/>\ne.g. the sharks are red, but sparsely distributed.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you find the corpse, target it, and type /corpse JoeBlow<br/>\nto drag it to a safer location.  I would not recommend looting<br/>\nit with the level 1 because if he should die, his corpse will<br/>\nonly last 30 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this is much easier if you have a high level friend<br/>\nyou can trust and /consent to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
