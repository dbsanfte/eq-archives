I blew this one once.  A clerical friend of mine and I were grouped in<br/>\nour mid-twenties to kill griffawns in NK one day and I&#39;m speeding around<br/>\nlooking for some prey.  I stumble across this named ghoul that is wandering<br/>\nthe plains of NK.  I kinda freak a bit, con it and it&#39;s white or blue to me<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall.  Well since I&#39;m fighting with a Cleric I say &quot;INC UNDEAD&quot;<br/>\nand punch it in the face.  We kill it pretty easily and it has this &quot;Bag of<br/>\nTroll Guts&quot;.  Well I too remembered the quest given in Qeynos so I ask for<br/>\nand receive the bag.  So later that night I jet down to Qeynos and give the<br/>\nbag to the female in the bard guild that is looking for Troll Gut for<br/>\nstrings.  She says &quot;Thank you&quot;, and that&#39;s all.  Then I realized later DOH!<br/>\nI never tried right clicking on it to open the damn thing.  Is it a 4 slot<br/>\ncontainer with troll guts in each slot?  After all it&#39;s called a BAG of<br/>\ntroll guts.  I&#39;ve been kicking myself ever since.  Try right clicking on it<br/>\nto see if it will open like a backpack.  I&#39;m dying to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall her name, but the person is the vendor in the middle of the<br/>\nlefthand wall when you enter the Qeynos guild hall.  If you&#39;re patient you<br/>\ncan sit in the guild hall and hear the NPCs having a discussion along the<br/>\nlines off &quot;Shhh..  don&#39;t tell soandso what his strings are made of.&quot;  Hail<br/>\nher, ask about the strings and you&#39;ll start the conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 35th song on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Benjamin Jerrad Segal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:birdman@...\">birdman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A friend of mine handed this to me, said it was off some rare NPC in North<br/>\n&gt; Karana.
