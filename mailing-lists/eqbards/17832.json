With<br/>\na low-end haste item like a swirlspine belt or FBSS, a bard<br/>\ncould arguably gain *more* benefit than any other melee class.  <br/>\nTake the FBSS for example.  It gives a 21% haste.  For a L50<br/>\nbard whose normal melee haste is 30% (Verses), the FBSS will<br/>\nput them at 75% haste - a 35% improvement.  For a sub-50 bard<br/>\nwhose normal max melee haste is 20% (Celerity), the FBSS gives<br/>\na 45% improvement.  In the hands of any other melee class,<br/>\nit&#39;s only a 21% improvement unless they&#39;re grouped with a bard<br/>\nor enchanter or shaman (only then does it become a 75%<br/>\nimprovement).  The difference is even more pronounced with a<br/>\nswirlspine belt which from reports is a 15% haste.  I dunno<br/>\nhow many bard/ench/sham are in your guild so I can&#39;t say how<br/>\ncompelling an argument that would be.  But if the melee<br/>\nclasses rarely group with bards and enchanters, then the melee<br/>\nargument favors the bard as most able to use a FBSS or<br/>\nswirlspine.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, OTOH, a bard of the right level to get these items has a<br/>\n*lot* of other tools available.  My Belt of Concordance goes<br/>\nmostly unused - a single Chant with my Selo&#39;s drum equals or<br/>\nexceeds my average melee output with weapons and max haste.  <br/>\nThe only time I use my weapons lately is when I feel like<br/>\ndiving into melee, or if the mob is pretty much immune to<br/>\nmagic, or if I&#39;m prohibited from using the chants (TTs in<br/>\nFear seem to poof if they die from a DoT).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend to your guild leader that rather than<br/>\ncompletely exclude bards from these items, to set up a<br/>\n&quot;scorecard.&quot;  If a bard has helped (say) 5 other people in the<br/>\nguild get a FBSS or swirlspine belt, then the next one is his.  <br/>\nThat avoids the slippery slope problem where newer younger<br/>\nguildmembers keep getting ahead of you in priority.  I would<br/>\nstay out of the CoF and RBB entirely, but if you really want<br/>\none, I&#39;d suggest something like seeing 25-30 of them given to<br/>\nguildmembers before you&#39;re allowed to roll for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a guild of 150+<br/>\n&gt; different players.

(even tho they stack)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Their reasoning is wrong - if you follow it through like I did<br/>\nabove, bards get the *most* melee benefit from haste items of<br/>\nany class.  But for the other reasons I outlined above, I<br/>\npretty much have to side with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, they damn well better be willing to break their backs to<br/>\nteleport a bard up to air if a Belt of Concordance drops and<br/>\nthere&#39;s no bard present.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
