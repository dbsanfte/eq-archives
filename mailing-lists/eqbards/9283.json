The first time I was in Unrest me and some <br/>\nbuddies were there killing the lawn trash, but we kept getting jumped by <br/>\nwandering ghouls (melee hevy party and only 2 magic weapons).  One time when <br/>\nI spotted a ghoul headed our way I decided in desperation to lament it, and <br/>\nit work! He just shuffed right into and out of our battle!  Made me feel <br/>\ngood to be a bard, haha.  Another good use is when your casters are medding <br/>\nand a wandering cat/bear/gnoll/whatever wanders by on mana patrol.  Hit it <br/>\nwith a Lament and it will got annoy someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
