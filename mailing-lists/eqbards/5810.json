The sig line being larger than the post made it appear the sig line WAS the post...<br/>\n<br/>\n    I will verify I&#39;ve noticed this sig line many times in the past - however on a long note it&#39;s easy to miss. If we want to make a policy against advertising in sig lines - I personally don&#39;t care one way or another - but I think we need to give him a chance to change his setup before he&#39;s kicked...<br/>\n<br/>\n    In the &quot;early&quot; days of the Internet (WAY back around &#39;93!) &quot;long&quot; sig lines were frowned upon because most of us (who weren&#39;t lucky enough to have a University account) were paying by the hour for access and modems were relatively slow - and believe me a five-line .sig would have been the start of a major flame-war - especially in a six line post!  So this is kind of nostalgia for me!<br/>\n<br/>\nDan/Slyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
