[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.j.mott@...\">mike.j.mott@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 05, 2000 6:48 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] healsong vs manasong<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well the catch is that using a gamepad *might* be considered <br/>\n&gt; a violation of<br/>\n&gt; the TOS -- from all the &quot;official&quot; comments, it seems that VI <br/>\n&gt; views gamepads<br/>\n&gt; as &quot;macroing&quot;.  Taking that into consideration, they also <br/>\n&gt; have backed off<br/>\n&gt; that stance somewhat since using a gamepad to twist songs <br/>\n&gt; (and it is NOT<br/>\n&gt; reliable in a battle due to missed notes, lag etc.) can offer <br/>\n&gt; relief to<br/>\n&gt; someone who is suffering from a physical disability, a <br/>\n&gt; repetitive stress<br/>\n&gt; condition etc..  I think the best guideline to go by is to <br/>\n&gt; NEVER leave your<br/>\n&gt; gamepad alone with a repetive &quot;macro&quot; going when you are not at the<br/>\n&gt; keyboard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I personally use a Microsoft Sidewinder Pro, which has <br/>\n&gt; software that allows<br/>\n&gt; you to program in extremely long series of keystrokes (my <br/>\n&gt; heal&#92;mana sequence<br/>\n&gt; lasts 10 minutes and my levitate&#92;selos sequence lasts 20 <br/>\n&gt; minutes).  Other<br/>\n&gt; gamepads allow programming keystrokes and also have an <br/>\n&gt; auto-fire button,<br/>\n&gt; which would be better suited to this application.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The big thing about using a gamepad to twist is you have to <br/>\n&gt; stop it from<br/>\n&gt; twisting to say anything. Also if you are using it for <br/>\n&gt; travel, and you miss<br/>\n&gt; a couple notes in a row trying to play levitation, well lets <br/>\n&gt; just say its<br/>\n&gt; not the fall that kills you - its the sudden stop.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lago Bardoon of Bertoxxulous, Bard of the 37th Composition, <br/>\n&gt; Defenders of<br/>\n&gt; Aleria<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dial 1-800-555-TELL -- You Won&#39;t Believe Your Ears!<br/>\n&gt; For more details, click here:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/9537/13/_/451022/_/970753698/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/9537/13/_/451022/_/970753698/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -------_-&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
