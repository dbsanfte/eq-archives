A mob that&#39;s aggressive to you will see you through<br/>\ninvisibility (although if you run far enough away from many<br/>\nmobs, they will give up chasing you although their aggressive<br/>\nradius to you remains enlarged).  In fact, if you are playing<br/>\nthe invisibility song and any member of your party is<br/>\nattacked, you will immediately be attacked because (1) you&#39;re<br/>\na bard, and (2) you cast a beneficial &quot;spell&quot; on someone who<br/>\nwas just attacked so the mob is now aggressive to you too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of (1) it&#39;s actually not uncommon for one of my party<br/>\nto briefly become visible, the mob(s) charge him, and the next<br/>\npulse they all retarget me because I&#39;m a bard.  What can I<br/>\nsay, get good armor.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou really have to watch out for (2) if you&#39;re in a group with<br/>\nmixed factions.  If your paladin friend has to kill the<br/>\ncorrupt guard at the Freeport bank and your song pulses on him<br/>\nwhile he fights, you will lose faction along with him.  If<br/>\nyour troll buddy gets whacked by the guards and one of your<br/>\nsongs pulses before he dies, the guards will be after you<br/>\nnext.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
