If they upgrade dragons/planes<br/>\nafter the expansion then I may have to wait 12 months or longer to do the<br/>\nthings I expected to do when I got to 50.  Lets assume after the expansion<br/>\n(with a level cap of 60) that it now takes a 55+ person to go on a<br/>\ndragon/plane raid.  If I understand what your saying, then I should just<br/>\nremain patient until I get to 55th level and then go on raids then (12<br/>\nmonths from now versus 6 months from now).  If this is the case, then sorry<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t agree with you.  If it takes me 6 months to get to 50 and go on<br/>\na dragon raid, then I can accept that and be patient.  But if the rules get<br/>\nchanged and I now have to wait 12 months before I can go on a dragon raid,<br/>\nthen I won&#39;t accept that.  I&#39;ll either retire my bard and play a different<br/>\nclass or quit the game entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
