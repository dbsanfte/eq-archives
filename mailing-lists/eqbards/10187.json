There is<br/>\nabsolutely nothing wrong with the way that you have acquired your equipment.<br/>\nMy first reaction to buying Lambent items is &quot;Hey, screw that.  Fight/quest<br/>\nfor them and wait to level 25ish to see your first piece like the rest of<br/>\nus.&quot;  However, upon reflection, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s exactly right.  I mean,<br/>\nif you&#39;re a merchant and barterer by trade, then it&#39;s your RPing<br/>\nresponsibility to trade up for items.  10pp for a bronze BP yields 45pp,<br/>\n40pp buys you a Dragoon Dirk in Crushbone that you sell for 55pp in<br/>\nFreeport, etc. etc.  Ultimately it&#39;s &quot;Nice Item of the Winter Winds&quot; or<br/>\nsomesuch traded for Lambent boots.  You COULD achieve all of this without<br/>\never even hitting level 2.  Is that right or wrong?  Dunno.  It&#39;s<br/>\nsubjective.  It&#39;s the way that you choose to play the game.  Personally I<br/>\nLIKE kicking the snot out of an Elite Goblin and tearing the Icy Greaves off<br/>\nof his cold green legs, venturing to Lower Guk and braving things many<br/>\nlevels above me to get the Shin Greaves and then getting some Lambent<br/>\nGreaves that are MINE.  When people ask me if I want to sell them I just<br/>\nthink &quot;Yeah, RIGHT.&quot; because I worked hard for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really just how you choose to play the game.  I have a friend that is a<br/>\ntradesman like this.  Got a bard to level 10 and is just holding there,<br/>\ntrading, trading, trading.  Runs all over the world trading but not<br/>\nfighting.  But as long as he&#39;s having fun, then he&#39;s getting his money&#39;s<br/>\nworth out of EQ.  Who am I to say he&#39;s playing the game &quot;wrong&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\nEQ - Pretend it&#39;s a game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rdparker@...\">rdparker@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First off I would like to introduce myself. I play Galeras, wood<br/>\n&gt; elf bard, on<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci. If you examine my character you will see something like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hail, I am Galeras, merchant and bard, lover of fine wine and women.<br/>\n&gt; I grew up poor but do not intend to die that way. Some day I will<br/>\n&gt; live in the<br/>\n&gt; highest trees of Kelethin where only the wealthy abide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wish Verant gave you more room. Anyway...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I started this character with a simple RP idea in mind, to play a<br/>\n&gt; character<br/>\n&gt; that was not twinked and had a strong desire to become rich. I<br/>\n&gt; should mention<br/>\n&gt; that I started Galeras on a server where I have no other<br/>\n&gt; characters and no<br/>\n&gt; friends to &quot;help&quot;. I have a few goals along the way for him, that I feel<br/>\n&gt; define &quot;rich&quot; and I use as milestones in my RP experiment. The<br/>\n&gt; first of which<br/>\n&gt; was to be in full bronze by level 8. A goal which I achieved last<br/>\n&gt; week after<br/>\n&gt; almost 4 days of /played time. In addition to the bronze I have a<br/>\n&gt; shiny brass<br/>\n&gt; shield, mino axe, tentacle whip, dwarven tunic and a few other things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now I am sure many people will wonder how one can do this without<br/>\n&gt; twinking.<br/>\n&gt; Let me just tell you how I began. I really don&#39;t want a lot of<br/>\n&gt; people doing<br/>\n&gt; this. Believe it or not I hate twinked characters with items out<br/>\n&gt; of their reach.<br/>\n&gt; Actually I love to see an orc or goblin kill a twink in full rubicite.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did the Felewithe mail run twice to get my first song. Then I basically<br/>\n&gt; quested and killed things until level 5. By level 5 I probably<br/>\n&gt; had made about<br/>\n&gt; 20pp. Most of this was done by trading. I am after all a merchant<br/>\n&gt; & bard. At<br/>\n&gt; level 5 I decided to travel, one of my favorite passtimes. So, I<br/>\n&gt; picked up a<br/>\n&gt; few passengers that wanted to travel with me and I went to<br/>\n&gt; Rivervale. (I am<br/>\n&gt; constantly helping others travel, find their corpses, etc. One of<br/>\n&gt; the reasons<br/>\n&gt; I chose a bard for my experiment. They have many ways to help<br/>\n&gt; others.) I was<br/>\n&gt; hoping to find a Blackened Iron Medallion at a good price that I<br/>\n&gt; could sell<br/>\n&gt; for a profit. Instead I saw a medium bronze breastplate for 10pp.<br/>\n&gt; I bought it<br/>\n&gt; and sold it in the commons for 45pp.  Anyway you no doubt get the<br/>\n&gt; idea of how I<br/>\n&gt; got to where I am.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My questions are these:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Is what I am doing wrong?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Is it outside the spirit of the game?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * What, if anything, can I do to dispell the illusion that I am a twink?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Buying lambent armour is I feel in-character for this<br/>\n&gt; character.  And, I<br/>\n&gt;   never thought twice about it until I was reading some recent<br/>\n&gt; posts. Will I<br/>\n&gt;   be hated for it? Is it wrong? Is it simply jealousy?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Galeras (Any suggestions?)<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 8th song<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
