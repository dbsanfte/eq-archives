I guess the best<br/>\nconfirmation is my own eyes =).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, given that the Watchman boot quest has to be started on a<br/>\nparticular day/time in game, I need to remind myself of the conversion from Earth to<br/>\nNorrathian time.  Last time I payed a lot of attention was trying to predict the<br/>\ntime of sunrise in North Karana so as to schedule a wedding =).  Notice that Norrath<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t rotate on its axis hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked around for information on charred boots and was kind of surprised not to<br/>\nfind any.  I would guess they drop in Sol A based on the name and the increase to<br/>\nfire reist.  Could someone help me out here please?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding mana song: have we chatted about its effect on casting cost?  Anyone done<br/>\ntests?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n//Maravana Vireo<br/>\n//50th Bard of the Jus Divinum<br/>\n//Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
