Mind you I have<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; actually hunted anything yet, but from a brief swim around the lake it<br/>\n&gt; seemed as though there would be plenty to hunt and hopefully I will find<br/>\n&gt; some pickup groups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Berwyn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLake Rathe is a nice area - the Aviaks give good experience - especially if<br/>\nyou get in a group where you can use the AE instrument attack. Eventually,<br/>\nas others have said, you should be able to solo the areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nEast Karana is also nice - undead reavers and gnoll reavers - although<br/>\nyou&#39;ll find that some of the gnoll reavers are green but even some of these<br/>\ngive a little exp. If you solo the reavers, try not to pull more than one at<br/>\na time - will make for faster down time. Same thing for Gorge Hounds, which<br/>\nare also in this zone and give pretty good experience. Just watch out for<br/>\nthe occasional evil eye and also the cyclops (Broon, Choon, Froon - don&#39;t<br/>\nremember which one is the starter spawn there)...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also hunted with groups in South Karana - Either at Aviak City or just<br/>\nrandomly around the zone hunting Centaurs. If you hunt Centaurs be careful!!<br/>\nThey are very social creatures - and there are some that will kill you VERY<br/>\nquickly - so have your drum handy in case you need to run (which will<br/>\nprobably happen now and then). At Aviak City - if you are able to get in the<br/>\ngroup in the Penthouse, be careful what you play there, as the axis bug will<br/>\nallow ground level creatures to hit you - just don&#39;t play AE songs there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve just now started venturing into places like Unrest - but the safest way<br/>\nto hunt in places like that is to go with someone who knows the zone AND in<br/>\na group. Thats my 2c from my exp thus far in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n==Lady Brangwen Incantare of the 22nd Song<br/>\n====The Lavender-Eyed Lady of Song<br/>\n======Squire Court of The Guild New Outriders<br/>\n========Citizen of the City of Kelethin on Faydwer<br/>\n=========Wife of High Elf Enchanter, Callais Incantare<br/>\n===========Server: The Rathe<br/>\n=============================================== </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
