Its amazing how few people like this it<br/>\ntakes to ruin GM events and make people paranoid about losing their hard won<br/>\ntreasures.  Glad to hear you&#39;re still upbeat after it though, doubt I would<br/>\nbe so charitable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother funny thing is seeing how many people won&#39;t change the subject line.<br/>\nNot that you&#39;re an idiot by any stretch, just an optimist, which is a good<br/>\nthing to be.

Last night, I made the mistake of consenting<br/>\nsomeone to drag Tani&#39;s corpse out of the Scryer room in Guk.  Well, long<br/>\nstory short, all my armor and weapons were stolen (punishment for twinking,<br/>\nheh) by this guy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are all sorts of complicating sidelines to this story which I&#39;ll spare<br/>\nyou.  Although I know it was always a risk, I just never thought someone<br/>\nwould be so mean and viscious.  The items are just items, but people that do<br/>\nthat stuff just plain suck!<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I&#39;ll have to make a contest to see how much of my quest stuff I can<br/>\nget back in one week.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you&#39;re all having a great day... and DON&#39;T CONSENT SOMEONE YOU DON&#39;T<br/>\nKNOW!!!<br/>\n(most of you have probably figured that out - guess I get to wear the naive<br/>\nbanner for the week)<br/>\n<br/>\nTani 20th nekkid Bard<br/>\nHalana 50th Shamana<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMAXIMIZE YOUR CARD, MINIMIZE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
