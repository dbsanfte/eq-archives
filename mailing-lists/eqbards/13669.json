I did it at 34 with a party of 3.  My brothers druid was 32 and my<br/>\nwife&#39;s warrior was 33 also.  Basically, the druid goes down and area effect<br/>\nharmonies ALL of them.  DO NOT USE LAMENT.  The gobs INSIDE the castle will<br/>\nagro if you pull one from the outside and you will always end up with more<br/>\nthen one.  You can&#39;t get inside to lament them all, but Harmony effects them<br/>\nall since it is area effect.  The warrior (yes, these are casters so you<br/>\nwill need some HP to get out of the water!) shoots one with a bow and runs<br/>\nout of the water to the inn.  The druid then snared, I feared and we<br/>\nproceeded to kill them for hours one at a time with very little downtime.<br/>\nHave the druid save mana for heals though instead of burning and these<br/>\nthings have A LOT of HP so snare sometimes runs out near the end of the<br/>\nbattle.  Expect to have to re-snare.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 40th song possibly retired<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.
