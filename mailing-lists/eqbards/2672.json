So my question is, is this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a bug or a feature? I am torn between wanting to be able to cancel roots<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and not cancel sow&#39;s. Ideally i would like to be able cancel roots and not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; screw up a sow. Either way i would love to hear an official answer. The<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I *think* the L22 song (Disenchantment) does exactly this<br/>\n&gt;without screwing up &quot;good&quot; song effects.  I&#39;ve been trying to<br/>\n&gt;test it but it&#39;s been difficult.  I managed to play it once<br/>\n&gt;when I got rooted last night, and it seemed to unroot me.  But<br/>\n&gt;I can&#39;t be sure if it really unrooted me, or if root just<br/>\n&gt;naturally expired at the same moment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By the way, root cancels SoW.  If your party is running for<br/>\n&gt;the zone and someone gets rooted, you&#39;re usually better off<br/>\n&gt;hitting Accelerando to unroot him and give him back some speed<br/>\n&gt;to get to the zone.  (For that matter, SoW cancels root.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
