My Halfling <br/>\nDruid (who STARTED amiable) took weeks to complete it.  Talies, on the <br/>\nother hand, has a looong way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, the ring is a one-shot Healing (100 hp), so really it&#39;s an <br/>\nemergency-only toy for lower levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ring can be &quot;recharged&quot; by giving it to Hendi Mrubble in the Cleric&#39;s <br/>\nGuild in Rivervale, but you have to have even MORE ungodly faction to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
