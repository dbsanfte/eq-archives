You&#39;ve found two of them.  <br/>\nThey will occasionally spawn ghouls, or groups of ghouls,<br/>\nwhich are the toughest creatures I&#39;ve seen there.  Four camps<br/>\nwas enough that I was able to clear them solo one after the<br/>\nother in my high teens without any wait.  The experience was<br/>\nslow then (only a few ghouls gave me experience), but the nice<br/>\nthing is you&#39;ll usually have all four camps to yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Southwest corner are four spots where some named<br/>\nShralok orcs appear.  They are sometimes replaced by various<br/>\nforest creatures (bats, wolves, fire beetles, etc) and will<br/>\nnot respawn until you kill the creature.  The orcs seem to<br/>\nrange from about L13-L17.  They are all named, but I&#39;ve never<br/>\ngot any special items off them.  The Chief I&#39;ve only killed<br/>\nonce so it&#39;s possible he carries something. The others I&#39;ve<br/>\nkilled about a dozen times each.  They usually carry rawhide,<br/>\nrusty weapons, and occasionally a bronze weapon.  Please note<br/>\nthat these are not the Shralok orcs that carry the shiny brass<br/>\nhalberd and Shralok pack - those are in Highpass.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe zone is probably great between levels 8 to about 15 mainly<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s empty.  Rivervale is just one zone away so you<br/>\ncan drop by any time to sell off your loot.  From about 14 to<br/>\n18 it&#39;ll be a bit slow, as the orcs are slow to respawn.  The<br/>\nonly thing you really have to fear there is being rooted by a<br/>\nghoul, which bards don&#39;t have to worry about.  That and<br/>\ngetting lost. :-)  Try to avoid area effect songs until you&#39;re<br/>\nfamiliar with the pattern of some of the wandering NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
