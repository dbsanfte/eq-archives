On golems and clerics, I switched to buffing<br/>\nmode, and on everything else I twisted the Chants.  I noticed that on mobs<br/>\nthat I was able to stick the Chants on consistently, we always got the<br/>\nexperience (2 tanks, cleric, druid, bard, and non-nuking enchanter) -- I<br/>\nstopped taking counts after we got the first 4 of 5.  Also, that&#39;s the first<br/>\ntime I&#39;ve ever been summoned by /anything/ in my entire bardic life, and it<br/>\nfelt GOOD!  (I was getting jealous of seeing everyone else&#39;s name spam by.<br/>\nI got summoned 3 times total, actually.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as there is a warrior or ranger in the group, I tend to have little<br/>\nproblem drawing attention twisting these three songs.  If not, I do draw<br/>\nsome heat.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust one note, though: since these are DoT&#39;s, the only benefit of having two<br/>\nbards play them is to overcome resist rates (which is definitely a benefit<br/>\nthat shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly).  Since the songs don&#39;t stack (okay, I&#39;m<br/>\nassuming here, since it&#39;s a DoT effect), two bards who are each able to<br/>\nconsistently stick the songs won&#39;t buy you a lot.  Of course, in the Planes,<br/>\nit does seem warranted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tested just before going to the Hate and verified that the Resist debuff<br/>\ncomponents do stick with the shammie line (combined dropped me 89 points<br/>\nwith an MM drum).<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
