I stumbled across it the other night and decided to check it <br/>\nout.  OH BOY, I thought...adventure!  Hmmm.  I played it safe and swam along <br/>\nthe left wall the entire time...it&#39;s pretty dark down there.  I didn&#39;t find <br/>\nthe tower or any aqua-goblins, but from reading your post I guess that is <br/>\nprobably a good thing.  Has anybody killed the underwater goblins?  Seems <br/>\nlike they might have some pretty cool loot being in such a hard to reach <br/>\nplace.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuldaas Riverdance<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Rebecca Small&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:macha_nabaob@...\">macha_nabaob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Ghoulsbanes and Chant of Battle<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1999 16:01:04 GMT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Rebecca Small&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:macha_nabaob@...\">macha_nabaob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail Fellow Bards,<br/>\n&gt;Speaking of Ghoulsbanes swords, my paladin husband has always maintained<br/>\n&gt;that the sword casts it&#39;s spell more often based on the wielder&#39;s dex. <br/>\n&gt;After<br/>\n&gt;camping and finally getting these for 2 of the guild paladins (*sigh*, one<br/>\n&gt;more to go), we went to lower guk for a break. It occurred to me to switch<br/>\n&gt;from Anthem to Chant for the dex boost to see if that would get more casts<br/>\n&gt;on the undead frogs. One paladin was pretty sure it did help. Since then,<br/>\n&gt;they have debated whether to get dex boost items. The other paladin got <br/>\n&gt;some<br/>\n&gt;dex boosts later on and now thinks it makes no difference. The point of <br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt;ramble: when fighting undead with paladins using Ghoulsbanes, try Chant and<br/>\n&gt;see if they think it helps the sword&#39;s casts.<br/>\n&gt;I finally hit hell 1, L30 after many misadventures. Ever wonder what is in<br/>\n&gt;the caves under the aviak guard island in Lake Rathe? I can confirm that<br/>\n&gt;cave connects to the cave under the island straight out from the docks at<br/>\n&gt;the Rathe Mountain zone pass. I can also tell you that L40ish spellcasting<br/>\n&gt;deepwater goblins live in the tower in the cave underwater. Great place to<br/>\n&gt;die. Fortunately, we did this exploration prior to me leveling. Not much<br/>\n&gt;chance of a rez there, lol.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Safe Journeys,<br/>\n&gt;Lady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\n&gt;Knight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\n&gt;Excalibur, Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;131<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
