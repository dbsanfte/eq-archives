Although, I<br/>\nwould suggest that you review your bronze armor and look at the weight to AC<br/>\nratio of each piece - iirc, some give lots more ac per pound that others.<br/>\nMaking those &#39;others&#39; key candidates for replacement with things that may<br/>\nhave a touch less ac but perhaps some other stats (dex+, mr+, etc.)  If I<br/>\nwere you, I would be looking for jewelry and other items with magic<br/>\nresistance, poison resistance (snakes are good from your level thru 13-15<br/>\niicr), or strength.  Level is God, AC is King & Resist items are you best<br/>\nfriends. Buffs are very nice too :)  There are also the &#39;classic&#39; bard<br/>\nthings: elf hide gloves, troll hide belt, mask of the deceiver (you are too<br/>\nyoung to fight for one but might be able to loot one if you brave the depths<br/>\nof Upper and Lower Guk - the Mask comes from a mid 30&#39;s camp.
