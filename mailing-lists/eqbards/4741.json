As soon as I attack<br/>\nsomething I hit F9 three times to get to the outside view. This makes me lag<br/>\nmuch less, allows me to see all around me in case something else decides to<br/>\nrun in and join the fight - and it has allowed me to sometimes get up to 4<br/>\nsongs going at once because my PC isn&#39;t lagging with all the eye candy on<br/>\nthe screen. After the fight is over (looting is also much easier in this<br/>\nview mode) just hit F9 two more times to return to first person view.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t already do that, try it - it makes life much easier.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
