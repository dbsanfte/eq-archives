Apparently the<br/>\nonly way to get Verant&#39;s attention is to make a huge fuss.  One nerf in the<br/>\nentire history of the game to monk&#39;s and they get a two page apology almost<br/>\ninstantly?  We get nada, no mention, no eta, no explanation, nothing.  It<br/>\nisn&#39;t as if this is the first time they broke something concerning bards, or<br/>\nnerfed it as I am still unwilling to take one GM&#39;s word as gospel on the<br/>\nreal motivation or lack thereof behind the change.  I have been bugging<br/>\nLullaby for 2 weeks now with no response.  I now continually see the same<br/>\nthings John(tm) was seeing earlier.  About 50% of the time Lullaby is not<br/>\nresisted, that is a get a successful nods message, the song does absolutely<br/>\nnothing.  I can nod a green Mob that is attacking or fleeing and 50% (or<br/>\nmore) of the time nothing will happen.  The Mob will continue to attack or<br/>\nwalk away despite my doing absolutely nothing else.  I know the song will<br/>\nstop a walking away Mob in it&#39;s tracks when it nods it correctly because<br/>\nthat does happen nearly 50% of the time.  I have still had no response on<br/>\nthis.  I am not high enough level to Pixie Strike yet so I can&#39;t say on that<br/>\none, but John(tm) has reported the same problems with that song.  So what is<br/>\ngoing on?  Did they decide that they wanted us to be resisted more, but knew<br/>\nif we started seeing tons of resists that we&#39;d all throw a fit so instead<br/>\nthey just inserted some code that would give a song a % chance of having an<br/>\neffect if it wasn&#39;t resisted?  Or is their coding just so suspect and their<br/>\ntesting so miniscule that this bug has slipped in unintentionally?  Who can<br/>\ntell with these guys.  Its so obvious they don&#39;t even do minimal testing on<br/>\ntheir changes, despite all their claims to the contrary, that you just can&#39;t<br/>\ntell if the changes they make are intentional or hideous blunders.  I mean,<br/>\ndamn they didn&#39;t even realize Alenia&#39;s was broken till we complained for 6<br/>\nmonths it didn&#39;t do anything.  Five minutes of testing showed Harmonic, not<br/>\nonly that it now did work, but even revealed some of the circumstances in<br/>\nwhich its working appeared quirky.  Five whole minutes.  In his spare time<br/>\nwhile at work.  If that little testing was required to show that the song<br/>\nworks, it shows how little testing they did to see if it did work in the<br/>\nfirst place.  Zero, absolutely none.  If the application development team<br/>\nhere, or anywhere I have worked for that matter, worked in such a matter we<br/>\nwould all be sacked.  Every last one of us, without a second though or<br/>\nminute&#39;s remorse.  In the business world, behavior like this is totally<br/>\nunacceptable, and would not be allowed to continue.  Why is this not true at<br/>\nVerant?  Either because their attitude is its just a game, bugs are not<br/>\nreally important and they can fix them when the players find them; or<br/>\nbecause they are so busy patting themselves on the back for having a<br/>\nsuccessful product, they can&#39;t be bothered to actually spend time making<br/>\nsure the quality of the product doesn&#39;t suffer every time they need to make<br/>\na change.  Verant has 300,000 customers.  Most software companies with 1/10<br/>\nthat number do 100x better at making certain that coding changes do not<br/>\nadversely affect their product in unforeseen ways.  The job Verant does at<br/>\nthis is pathetic.  They come across as a bunch of kid-whiz programmers who<br/>\nmay be technically sound, but so disorganized and undisciplined they have no<br/>\nidea what the changes they make to their code might do, and don&#39;t give it a<br/>\nsecond thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Joshua R.

They were changing ADM, and<br/>\nwhoever was working on it was probably not the person who originally<br/>\ncoded the spells, and didn&#39;t realize that Aria would be affected by<br/>\nit.  It happens, even to me.  They don&#39;t have time to go back and test<br/>\n*every* aspect of the game for each patch, simply because if they did,<br/>\nthe patch would be rather long in getting out.  That bug will likely<br/>\nbe fixed in the next patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobynn, programmer extrordonaire...who should be getting ready for<br/>\nwork right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nKaty Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\nCS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
