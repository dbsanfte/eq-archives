Does anyone else thing buying songs ahead of time is<br/>\n&gt; bad luck???<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 22st song<br/>\n  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I also am a 22nd Sylly and have all my songs up to 28 squirreled away.<br/>\nThat&#39;s not the problem &quot;Silly&quot;, it&#39;s called Dying... I was halfway into<br/>\nthe level when I started helping some poor guys &quot;sickened&quot; by Evil eyes<br/>\nin the Gorge.. I died 3 times that evening...
