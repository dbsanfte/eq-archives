They&#39;d get their<br/>\n&gt;butts kicked so bad.  You pull one cat at lower level and the whole place<br/>\n&gt;comes.  They need to fix aggro range or pathing or linkage or whatever it<br/>\n&gt;is, this zone is just horrible right now, and yet its a very cool zone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Minkin<br/>\n&gt;sol ro<br/>\n&gt;Level 36 questing fool<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;P.S.
