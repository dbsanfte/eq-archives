If you knuckle down and ignore<br/>\nyour arm falling asleep, 40pp (some claim 60pp) for an hour&#39;s time is not<br/>\ntoo bad, really.  Was with brewing I brought my bank account from a few<br/>\nsilver to afford a combine.  I have a druid friend who was going to retire<br/>\nat level 19 just because he couldn&#39;t afford his spells!  But now he brews.<br/>\nAnd brews.  And brews.  (I almost feel guilty for explaining the trade to<br/>\nhim.)<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently there is some bard on your very server, Fenin Ro, around level 8<br/>\nor 9, selling Bog Juice.  I have no idea where to even start with respect to<br/>\nexperimenting with recipies for it.  The EQBrewers list is fairly worthless<br/>\nin this respect, just folks arguing and ranting--no real exchange of<br/>\ninformation for Bog Juice.  The recipe will likely be shared there last,<br/>\ntoo, when the secret&#39;s out.  Anyone know where this flaming sword Paladin<br/>\nquest even starts so I can look into it and experiment for this new<br/>\nlibation?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for bards and drinking, ah just like the old Bard&#39;s Tale.  Mages had<br/>\nmana, bards had their booze.  I kind of play it that way too, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor level 19, been to Unrest?  Or Permafrost?<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Ward Family&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jajward@...\">jajward@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>snip<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Cleaver, Fennin Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
