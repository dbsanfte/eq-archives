It sounds like the devils own deal (clear their agro-list<br/>\nthen when they wake up you are the only thing on it) but it is not so bad if<br/>\nyou are in a group that knows how to look out for you. You CAN control over<br/>\nsized pulls, and you can help a group get started on an orc camp or the<br/>\nlike. To do that, muster every brave cell in your body, walk into the Orc<br/>\ncamp with only your lute singing lullaby. They will all swarm you and<br/>\nsuddenly a fair number of them (if you are lucky, all of them) will start<br/>\nsnoozing. If you get stunned a bit first don&#39;t panic, just keep trying to<br/>\nplay the song. Have your group pick ONE Orc, the strongest one, and kill it,<br/>\nthen move on to the next, when there is only one or two you can join in<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig scary fun, like nothing else Ihave done in EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
