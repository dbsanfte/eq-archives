I went to CB but the orc&#39;s hit so hard that it<br/>\n&gt;keeps<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At level 12, I was still doing OK hunting solo in the Steamfont Mountains.<br/>\n&gt;  I liked the areas near the Windmills where you can find skeletons, <br/>\n&gt;drakes,<br/>\n&gt;and harpies.  Just pick your targets carefully, and kick in the bardboots<br/>\n&gt;song and run if your health goes below half or if a second creature engages<br/>\n&gt;you while you&#39;re fighting the first one.  (Skeletons are especially a<br/>\n&gt;problem this way, since they stun.  I died only once to a drake, but<br/>\n&gt;several times to skeletons or skeleton-rat gangups, because they stunned me<br/>\n&gt;and kept me from runnint.)  And of course if you see the Minotaur Hero, run<br/>\n&gt;for the city or the zoneline.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Starting from level 10, though, I found that soloing became increasingly<br/>\n&gt;difficult.  At level 12 it got a big boost from the Bellow song, which<br/>\n&gt;probably increased my combat effectiveness by fifty percent.  But as you<br/>\n&gt;  increase in level, you will find yourself much more effective in a party<br/>\n&gt;than solo.  I found that teaming up with Monks works especially well.  Even<br/>\n&gt;if I did nothing but stand there and play the lute twiddling between<br/>\n&gt;healing song and battlesong (and hit with an occasional punch for a few<br/>\n&gt;points), the monks and I together got far more experience than either could<br/>\n&gt;manage on our own, since they fought better and didn&#39;t have to wait so long<br/>\n&gt;between battles to recover.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
