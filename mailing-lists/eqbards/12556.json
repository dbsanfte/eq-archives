If <br/>\nthere are fewer items in inventory than required to complete the quest, you <br/>\nget the &quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&quot; line.  When all the quest items <br/>\nare in the NPCs inventory, the quest is completed and the inventory is <br/>\ndeleted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI discovered this quite by accident when I gave Sylia Windlehands 3 <br/>\nspidersilks instead of the 4 she wanted and completed the quest.  Every <br/>\nsubsequent time I did it I would bring 4 or more silks and give them to her <br/>\none at a time - and quite frequently it took fewer than 4 to complete the <br/>\nquest.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy theory, then, is that someone somehow handed in a single quest item, <br/>\nperhaps thinking the lambent quests should be done in stages.  You handed in <br/>\nthe other three, triggering the quest completion (receiving your <br/>\nbreastplate, congrats!!!), and also gave one &quot;extra&quot; component, thus <br/>\ntriggering the &quot;extra&quot; error message.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard that some quests require all the items to be given at the same <br/>\ntime, though I don&#39;t test to see which - most quests I do these days cost a <br/>\nfair amount of time and/or money, and I don&#39;t want to repeat them if I <br/>\nhappen to guess wrong.  So although I have tested this trick with spider <br/>\nsilk (and once, by accident, with honey jum) I can&#39;t guarantee it works with <br/>\nall quests.
