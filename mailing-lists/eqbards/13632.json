They can make the same<br/>\nloot in guk spawn in Paw for all I care but give me a  zone where I can get<br/>\nsome loot. Again I think the hihg level prohblem is more deservering<br/>\nconsdiering you just want new stuff well you can do that go level some and<br/>\nyou can get new stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, January 24, 2000 4:12 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One big problem is the items that were nifty and new to you when you first<br/>\n&gt;got them at 21st are items we bought when we were 12th level.

Since nothing ever decays in the game the mobs we now fight<br/>\n&gt;carry loot we have used and in some cases discarded several levels ago.  I<br/>\n&gt;had the same weapons at 12th level that I did at 19th level because they<br/>\n&gt;were easily affordable at 12th even though they came off of mobs I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;hope to face for another 6+ levels.  The only way I can get any new<br/>\n&gt;interesting loot at this point is to buy it or camp one of the ultra-rare<br/>\n&gt;spawns for days on end.  EQ is the perfect example of a trickle-down<br/>\n&gt;economy.  Too bad we mid-levels would love to have something we could earn<br/>\n&gt;directly.  We have the same problem you do at lvl 50.  I don&#39;t really care<br/>\n&gt;all that much about xp either.

Of course if they did open a new zone for level<br/>\n&gt;20-30 all the 50&#39;s would swarm in and kill everything just to see what it<br/>\n&gt;dropped anyhow so I still wouldn&#39;t find anything new.

As a 50th<br/>\n&gt;&gt;level character, Naeeldar&#39;s opinion is the the #1 problem with EQ is that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;there isn&#39;t enough stuff for 50th level players to do.  I agree with him<br/>\n&gt;&gt;100%.  As a 32d level player, my opinion is that the #1 problem with EQ is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that Verant seems to be neglecting the 46- players.  By this I mean there<br/>\n&gt;&gt;are a lot of areas in the game that need to be fixed, i.e. more quality<br/>\n&gt;&gt;quests, new items for medium level characters, bugs, etc.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Bottom line is that if EQ is gonna remain profitable over the next few<br/>\n&gt;&gt;years, both areas need to be fixed.  Verant has stated that they have<br/>\n&gt;&gt;multiple teams working on different areas (expansion, fixing current game,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;etc).  It just seems to me that all improvements to the game are geared<br/>\n&gt;&gt;toward keeping the 46+ players happy (i.e. all the teams really working on<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the same thing) and not fixing the stuff broken in the current game.  IMO,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;fixing whats broken in the current game and adding new content (quality<br/>\n&gt;&gt;quests) is more appropriate for the long term health of the game.  Now the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;counter argument is that if the level 50 players don&#39;t have something to<br/>\n&gt;do,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;they will cancel their subscription. Here&#39;s my opinion on that.  At some<br/>\n&gt;&gt;point in time, I think you just have to say its time to hang up the spurs<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and move on.  Either you start another character or you move on to another<br/>\n&gt;&gt;game.  Like Kitasi said in his post, the programmers will never be able to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;keep up with the level 50 players.  The expansion will only be a short<br/>\n </span></blockquote>term<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;fix.  Assuming EQ2 is several years down the road, fixing the current game<br/>\n&gt;&gt;(bugs) and adding new content (for everyone level 1-50) is the only viable<br/>\n&gt;&gt;option from a business perspective IMO.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually I think Verant is missing the point there.  They will never be<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; able<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to do enough to keep up with the level 50 players unless they totally<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ignore<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the lower level players.  The majority of the level 50 players play the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; game<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; far too much for Verant to be able to keep up wit providing them new<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Although those players play the game more they don&#39;t pay any more than<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lower level players.  I have lost close to 20 guild members just in my<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; guild<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; because they were tired of Verant only doing things for level 46+<br/>\n&gt;players.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Eventually at this rate Verant will only have those level 46+ players<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; left.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Kit<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually you get to play a new class so not boring. They have to fix<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; overcrowding with high levels first and their is no reason they should<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bother with anything else until that happens otherwise Verant will lose<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; good percentage of their customers.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
