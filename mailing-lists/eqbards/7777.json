If the other mob is going<br/>\nto win, you can usually tell because the mob you charmed will<br/>\nget close to death.  Once it&#39;s close, to where a couple rounds<br/>\nshould end the battle, you charm the other mob.  The first mob<br/>\nwill be hitting you, but the winning mob should finish it<br/>\nwhile charmed thus getting you the kill.
