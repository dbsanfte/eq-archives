I <br/>\n&gt; was totally unbuffed and when her AE hit me it dropped me <br/>\n&gt; well under 30% <br/>\n&gt; life so I hauled ass. =)  She cons kindly to me, and never <br/>\n&gt; agrroed me. I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; not sure what caused her to go aggro on you. During downtime <br/>\n&gt; in VP some <br/>\n&gt; friends of mine decided to duel (don&#39;t EVER do this in VP), <br/>\n&gt; and Hoshkar, who <br/>\n&gt; is kindly to me, stand right on top of me and kill them. His <br/>\n&gt; AE hit me HARD, <br/>\n&gt; but he walked away after my friends died w/out aggroing me. *shrug*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sartori{Legion}<br/>\n&gt; 57th Troubador<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Side question about Gorenaire.  I was fighting along the <br/>\n&gt; castle north wall<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in Dreads when a Gorenaire raid was going on.  I conned the <br/>\n&gt; dragon and I <br/>\n&gt; &gt;was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;either warmly or amiable.  So I got close to take some <br/>\n&gt; screenshots since<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this was the first time I had ever seen a dragon.  I had <br/>\n&gt; Selos up and was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;standing right in front of Gorenaire when she decided to <br/>\n&gt; swat me.  Before I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;realized what was going on, I was back at my bind point.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So did I die to a bug or will Gorenaire, once aggroed, <br/>\n&gt; attack anyone near<br/>\n&gt; &gt;her, even if they weren&#39;t involved in the attack?  BTW I was <br/>\n&gt; not in wolf<br/>\n&gt; &gt;form nor was I grouped with anyone at the time who had pets <br/>\n&gt; (which I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;been told will cause her to attack you).<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ___________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; eGroups eLerts<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s Easy.
