Here&#39;s what<br/>\nhappens.  Puller grabs a MOB, usually by whacking on it, or shooting it with<br/>\nan arrow/spell.  This MOB is then very angry at puller for having done<br/>\ndamage to it - great! exactly what we want.  Everyone then assists the<br/>\npuller and continues to whack on this MOB, keeping its attention mainly off<br/>\nthe bard.  <br/>\nHere&#39;s the problem.  The MOB that is being pulled seldom comes alone, he<br/>\nbrings along all his closest &quot;friends&quot;.  These &quot;friends&quot; haven&#39;t been<br/>\nwhacked, so their hate level is relatively low towards the puller, in fact<br/>\nthis hate level is next to none.  Everyone is busy whacking on the original<br/>\npulled MOB, so these &quot;friends&quot; don&#39;t have any increasing hate level to<br/>\nanyone in particular because nobody is hitting them, they just came along to<br/>\nlend a hand.  When it comes time for these &quot;friends&quot; to chose a target, they<br/>\nnaturally focus their attention on the bard since nobody else is really<br/>\ndoing them any harm, but a bard healing/buffing is considered to be dealing<br/>\ndamage to the &quot;friends&quot; themselves as far as hate is concerned.<br/>\nThe result - one MOB attacking the puller/tanks/casters, the other 5 or 6<br/>\nMOBS focus on the bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to cut down on this behavior:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Don&#39;t start playing songs before the fight begins.  when MOBS first<br/>\narrive, their hate level is at its lowest, and they will go directly for<br/>\nyou.  Sometimes even the pulled one will jump you as your healing outweighs<br/>\nthe damage done by the puller.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) If their are more than 2 MOBS, don&#39;t buff/heal your entire party, unless<br/>\nyou have a tank that knows to taunt the extra MOBS off of you.  Generally, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t play buff songs if there are more than 2 MOBS.  Two or more monsters<br/>\nfocusing their attacks on the bard mean the healer has to concentrate solely<br/>\non you, when the tanks could have been absorbing the damage much better.<br/>\nI&#39;ll concentrate on charm<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The healing song is one of the largest taunts.  Be very careful using<br/>\nthis in multi MOB situations, it can easily mean your death.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 41 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nThe possible answer to this is faction. If the extra mob hate for bards<br/>\nis done intentionally by Verant, it&#39;s possible they base it on faction.<br/>\nAs it&#39;s been noted the Avaiks have no faction it&#39;s also possible they<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been programmed to hate any factions either. I would say if you<br/>\ntook away the magic thing that makes bards and bard songs the top hated<br/>\nthing by mobs you would probably rarely end up at the top of their hate<br/>\nlist by your own efforts, as you would rarely if ever do more damage<br/>\nthan anyone else in your party. Even the benefits of the heal song would<br/>\nbe quickly eclipsed by the first heal cast by a cleric/druid/shaman of<br/>\nyour level.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
