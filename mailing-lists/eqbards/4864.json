My biggest dissapointment at becoming a bard in the beginning, went to buy a bow only to find we cannot use them.  I could care less that they are somewhat inefficient, I just wanted to be able to use one.  It fits into almost every concept of a bard in fantasy literature and games, but not in EQ?  Can&#39;t figure out why since it clearly is not unbalancing.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually it can be very unbalancing.  You could stand outside of combat, play songs with an instrument and still be able to fire arrows into combat.  Last I heard people were capable of doing 20+ dmg per arrow.  The trade off we make for having more effective songs when played is that we&#39;re out of combat and generally not doing direct damage (except of course bellow/discord/etc).  If we could use bows then there&#39;d be no decision to make as to sing or play songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Funny thing is 7 is all I canthink of right offhand.  I still think bards are a great class, most of my gripes are little things.  I still hold to my feeling that I will never play another non-binding class however.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d have to concur, which is why I tend to laugh a bit when I see a bard petition being proposed.  There are much larger issues in the game, but still it&#39;s nice to have a concise list of what we see as problem areas.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
