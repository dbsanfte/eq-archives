I have a few questions that arose during my adventure<br/>\n&gt; today....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) I have a Lute called &quot;Lute of the Gypsy Princess&quot; or <br/>\n&gt; something like that.<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know if it has any significance? Is it just a <br/>\n&gt; quest item? I<br/>\n&gt; tried using it, and it works in all respects (that I could <br/>\n&gt; tell) like a<br/>\n&gt; normal Lute. Nothing special. I did notice that I could sell <br/>\n&gt; it for almost 4<br/>\n&gt; plat, where a normal lute doesn&#39;t make it to 1 plat. Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) I also just picked up &quot;Lisera&quot;, a lute that a bard in Qeynos needs<br/>\n&gt; tuning. He says that I need to take it to someone named <br/>\n&gt; Nostrolo in the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Karanas&quot;. But, I looked and looked and could not FINFD This Nostrolo<br/>\n&gt; person. Is this a broken quest, or have I just missed this <br/>\n&gt; fella? Could<br/>\n&gt; someone give me an idea where to look for Nostrolo? Also, is <br/>\n&gt; Lisera a lute<br/>\n&gt; you should KEEP, meaning is IT better than a regular Lute?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) Does anyone know of a site that has descriptions of what <br/>\n&gt; songs do above<br/>\n&gt; 24th level??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for all your help!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tim<br/>\n&gt; Tallonn Stringfellow - Bertox<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
