The above is true - if everyone distributes<br/>\n&gt; damage well, except for the tough fights you basically have<br/>\n&gt; zero downtime.  Someone goes to pull the next mob while you<br/>\n&gt; top off every else&#39;s health.  The only downside is that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; very nervewracking (for the bard at least) playing without a<br/>\n&gt; primary healer.  Having a paldin with lay hands helps<br/>\n&gt; tremendously in easing that fear.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Amen brother.
