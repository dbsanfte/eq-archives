Mobs are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; good little trains - another is along every X min. like clockwork. If an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; area is so massively crowded that I can&#39;t move - I just log - or find<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; somewhere else to hunt.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is self-contradictory.  On the one hand, you say &quot;so what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if it&#39;s crowded?&quot;  On the other you say if it&#39;s too crowded,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you just logout.  If your attitude towards it is &quot;so what,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is a condition - while a problem - it is not one attributable to PEOPLE. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My biggest problem with too many folks in an area isn&#39;t nothing to hunt -<br/>\n&gt; or having to grab a mob before someone else does - it&#39;s simply a matter of<br/>\n&gt; lag. Lag is based (for me at least) solely on the amount of activity going<br/>\n&gt; on and mobiles (including players) in an area. I don&#39;t consider this a<br/>\n&gt; matter of competition - it&#39;s just a fact given the current state of<br/>\n&gt; technology and primarily my connection. It has nadda to do with who is<br/>\n&gt; there - obviously if a zone is so crowded I constantly crash - or can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; move - that IS a problem - but not something I attribute to other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let me cut to the chase:  If you were in a zone with nothing<br/>\nto hunt, would you continue playing?  Would most people<br/>\ncontinue playing?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if so many people/people of enough capability are in the<br/>\nzone so that there is practically nothing to hunt, would your<br/>\nanswer be different?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how you can claim it&#39;s not attributable to people<br/>\nwhen everything else is the same and the only differing factor<br/>\nis people.  True, they are not deliberately and directly<br/>\npreventing you from finding anything to hunt, but they are<br/>\ndoing it indirectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you don&#39;t care about finding mobs to kill, then I can<br/>\nsee why you feel the way you do.  But I hardly think that&#39;s<br/>\nrepresentative of the majority of the playerbase.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They have as much right to be there as I do, while I could think of several<br/>\n&gt; ways to handle this a bit better - I don&#39;t blame it on other folks - and<br/>\n&gt; what they may or may not have.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why are you putting an ethical spin on this?  Their reasons<br/>\nfor doing what they do are irrelevant (aside from how it<br/>\nrelates to their enjoyment of the game).  If there are too<br/>\nmany people playing the game as it was meant to be played, it<br/>\nhas a negative impact on overall player enjoyment.  There&#39;s no<br/>\nill will or malicious intent behind that, it&#39;s just the way it<br/>\nis - supply falls short of demand so the public grows<br/>\ndiscontent.  Given that inescapable fact, how do you best<br/>\ndesign the game to mitigate this reduction in enjoyment?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
