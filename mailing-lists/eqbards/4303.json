So it isn&#39;t a<br/>\n&gt; double standard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you subscribe to the &quot;your actions should not detract from<br/>\n&gt; others&#39; gameplay&quot; ideology, then twinking detracts from your<br/>\n&gt; gameplay and you should withhold help from twinkers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Whichever ideology you subscribe to, your actions and feelings<br/>\n&gt; are self-consistent, and the other ideology&#39;s actions are a<br/>\n&gt; violation.  They are mutually exclusive, and thus there can be<br/>\n&gt; no resolution or compromise between the two.  The best we can<br/>\n&gt; hope for is coexistence without resorting to petty insults<br/>\n&gt; (twinker or jealousy).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If we can agree to that, I&#39;d like to end the twinking thread.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
