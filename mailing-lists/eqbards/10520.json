Not sure if you would have time to cast - 6.2 seems like you<br/>\nprolly could have.  Is 2 or 3 nights loot worth avoiding a death and<br/>\ndifficult CR?  But I guess CR was not that difficult there.  I think I would<br/>\ndefinitely have it when I get to go to the Planes (sheesh whenever that will<br/>\nbe.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, so what did Sog do until / when the charm wore off? Did he<br/>\ngate/succor/evac out?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been in groups where a member gets charmed (picture this a Troll<br/>\nWarrior with Painbringer or was it Executioner&#39;s Axe - some uber-wep, buffed<br/>\nto the max with symbols, valor, enchanter celerity, etc. etc. and charmed)<br/>\nand they yell for &#39;cancel magic&#39; to be cast instead of fighting him.  I<br/>\nguess our enchanter mezzed him and we waited for the charm to wear off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. after that event, we discussed disbanding him, dueling him, then<br/>\ncharming him and making him fight for us.  Like Harm mentions when you are<br/>\ncharmed you get to fight with the efficiency and powers that NPC&#39;s have.  We<br/>\ndropped the idea for various reasons all adding up to too risky for him and<br/>\nus and too much of a hassle for CR if he died.  Maybe worth a try someday<br/>\nfor fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tRyan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, November 23, 1999 10:08 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Lute of the Gypsy Princess and<br/>\nother lutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; Question:  could you have un-charmed him with a pumice<br/>\n </span></blockquote>stone?
