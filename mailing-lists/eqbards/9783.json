Almost every class is<br/>\n&gt;&quot;unfinished&quot;.  There are many spells and skills that were never implemented<br/>\n&gt;or useless.  For example many classes have the Sense Magic spell, which has<br/>\n&gt;no use at all.  And what about the poor Rogues?

Since Making the game more fun is in no way unbalancing and bind<br/>\nwon&#39;t increase a bard&#39;s ability to beat anything, especially at a high<br/>\nlevel, it isn&#39;t even remotely unbalancing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be somewhat bitter that bards are treated as an afterthought in many<br/>\nways by Verant, but at least I&#39;m not bitter towards anyone personally.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
