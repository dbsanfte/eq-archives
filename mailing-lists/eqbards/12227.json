This make take a while to say everything I want so please bear with<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike many of you out there, I started playing RPGs in the late 70s and early<br/>\n80s with high school and college buddies.  First off was AD&D then moved on<br/>\nto others such as Warhammer and Rolemaster.  Because we always played with<br/>\nthe same group, everyone&#39;s character was always close to one another.  The<br/>\nGMs would design their dungeons and campaigns based on the level of our<br/>\nparty.  In other words, any dungeon we went into we knew that we could go<br/>\nfrom start to finish with the characters we had when we started the dungeon.<br/>\nThis was the good old fashioned dungeon crawl.  Traps, puzzles, treasure and<br/>\nmonsters to fight spaced out all along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis type of adventuring was what I hoped EQ would be when I first started<br/>\nplaying.  Unfortunately, the way Verant designed every dungeon in the game<br/>\nprecludes the classic dungeon crawl mode of fantasy RPGs.  In every dungeon<br/>\nyou can go to, what you will see is lower level characters at the beginning<br/>\nof the dungeon, intermediate levels in the middle, and higher level players<br/>\nin the depths.  Because of the way EQ is designed everyone is forced to camp<br/>\nbecause if they tried to go further into the dungeon they are almost<br/>\ncertainly going to die.  This issue has been brought up in numerous EQ<br/>\nforums and debated until no end.  With that said..<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you guys think its possible for a game like EQ to have dungeons where<br/>\nplayers can actually complete a dungeon via the dungeon crawl method?  Here<br/>\nis an example of how it could function:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  All dungeons designed where a party of six all within a set range of<br/>\nlevels could defeat every mob within the dungeon.<br/>\n2)  Dungeons include traps, locked doors, puzzles, etc to make a rogue a<br/>\nuseful party member.<br/>\n3)  Spells like wizard lock and barrier type spells included to make the<br/>\nparty safe from wandering mobs and trains.  You go into a room and get into<br/>\na fight.  Caster could magically lock the door to keep wandering mobs out.<br/>\nIf you are fighting in a hallway, caster could cast a barrier type spell to<br/>\nkeep wandering mobs from joining in the fight or from following the party.<br/>\n4)  A mob in each location drops a key required to move on to next area of<br/>\ndungeon.  Party moves from location to location further down into dungeon.<br/>\nMobs don&#39;t respawn in an area until the party moves on to next area.<br/>\n5)  Treasure chests located in specific locations contain minor items and/or<br/>\nmoney as a reward for killing the mobs in that location.<br/>\n6)  Boss mob at the end of the dungeon.  Killing him produces a key that is<br/>\nused to open up a special treasure chest.  This chest has the rewards in it<br/>\nfor successfully completing the dungeon.  Chest contains money and one magic<br/>\nitem for each member in the party.  Each person only allowed to loot one<br/>\nitem from the chest to ensure everyone gets at least one magic item for<br/>\ncompleting the dungeon.  Items in chest random every time it is opened.<br/>\n7)  One way exit from the dungeon after killing the boss mob so you dont<br/>\nhave to go all the way back to the entrance.<br/>\n8)  Additional one way exits from dungeon at certain points along the way in<br/>\ncase someone has to leave party for whatever reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably a lot of things I have left out but this is the gist of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nImplementing something like this would require a radical change in design<br/>\nphilosophy.  I&#39;m not even certain it would be possible in EQ but its<br/>\ncertainly a possibility in EQ2 assuming it comes out a few years down the<br/>\nroad.  Key question is it possible for something like this to work in an<br/>\nonline game?<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout a doubt it will require some kind of control mechanism for parties<br/>\nto enter the dungeon one at a time and spaced out from one another.  Not<br/>\ncertain how this would work.  Would probably require an online GM/Guide for<br/>\neach dungeon.  Don&#39;t think you could rely on player cooperation because<br/>\nthere will alwys be people arguing its their turn to go in.  There would<br/>\nalso need to be a mechanism to ensure an orderly progression of parties<br/>\nwithin the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m out of time and this has gone on long enough so I&#39;ll end it here.<br/>\nApologize for the big-time off topic post but thought the topic was good<br/>\nenough to throw it out there to get everyone&#39;s opinion.  If this stirs up a<br/>\nlot of discussion, do you guys think it would be worthwhile to consolidate<br/>\nall the ideas/opinions everyone has and send them to Verant?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n29 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t(snipped)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s not impossible, but it becomes increasingly difficult.<br/>\n&gt; Not only will you need to camp to get the nice items, you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; find it more and more dangerous to sweep through dungeons<br/>\n&gt; because mob aggro radii work regardless of LOS.  So you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; probably resort to camping a location if not a mob, and<br/>\n&gt; pulling to get stuff to kill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t(snipped)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These are two major problems I see with the game.  Too many<br/>\n&gt; players, and (paradoxically) too many mobs given the amount of<br/>\n&gt; space they&#39;re packed in (this was done to support the too many<br/>\n&gt; players).  As a result, any deviation from camping results in<br/>\n&gt; a high probability of starting a train and/or pissing off<br/>\n&gt; other players.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
