Then GZ - and who<br/>\never else came up with the design and great concept move to other Verant<br/>\nprojects or perhaps leave the company.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are now left with Abashi and the &quot;Tuning Team&quot; and THEIR vision.  What I<br/>\njust don&#39;t get is what they are basing it on.  The initial nerf of Lullaby<br/>\nto 4 mobs is one we all agree with - no problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe get the chains nerf.  Again - the nerf to the higher level song - no<br/>\nproblem we all agree with that.  When they broke the lower one - they<br/>\ninitially said they would fix it.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong - but that was GZ<br/>\nnot GW who said it would be fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow with GW as lead designer (perhaps there&#39;s someone else behind the<br/>\nscenes - but it sure seems like it&#39;s GW) with HIS vision of bards - the<br/>\nnerfed-Chains functioning sure seems fine with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at lullaby - same thing.  Will we get a change to Pixie Strike and Song<br/>\nof Twilight?  Perhaps simply because we&#39;re a squeaky wheel - but I won&#39;t be<br/>\nsurprised if not either...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - played a short while last night and dinged the necro to 6...<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

Here was Gordon&#39;s response.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;ll leave in-depth determination of &quot;role&quot; to those playing it, I<br/>\nthink that you&#39;ve answered your own question here. Bards are good at so many<br/>\nthings, you&#39;re surely here to do some of those things. I feel that Bards<br/>\nexcell at making a good group better. That&#39;s my opinion. What&#39;s more<br/>\nimportant though is, what is a bard&#39;s role to you? If you look at it as a<br/>\nwalking-talking mana battery, there&#39;s not really much I can do to make you<br/>\nfeel better about it. It&#39;s the same issues with the clerics who often<br/>\ncomplain that they are a walking-talking hitpoint-battery. You are a support<br/>\nclass. You support the group, and you do it very well. Whether or not you<br/>\nare happy with that role is up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty pathetic in my opinion.  Obviously Gordon just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>\nThere&#39;s a huge difference between the satisfaction one gets from saving a<br/>\ncomrade&#39;s life (virtual or not) and the satisfaction of knowing that the<br/>\ndruid can get off one more Careless Lightning because you stood around and<br/>\nplayed mana battery.  What a joke.  Obviously in VI&#39;s &quot;Vision&quot; bards are not<br/>\nmeant to be real characters.  Our role is solely to support other&#39;s efforts.<br/>\nThey should have called the class &quot;Sidekick&quot; instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
