If I <br/>\n&gt;assume that it works instantly<br/>\n&gt;(as the icon suggests), and press another song key, I get song-locked every <br/>\n&gt;time.  It takes some getting<br/>\n&gt;used to.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I have a kind of crummy <br/>\n&gt;machine running on a dial-up, so I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;singing through lag a lot, and anticipating song pulses rather than waiting <br/>\n&gt;for the messages, so maybe the<br/>\n&gt;rest of you have better luck with it.  We were killing the King in Chardok <br/>\n&gt;last night, and I was singing<br/>\n&gt;songs two full songs ahead of the messages, which shows how bad it gets for <br/>\n&gt;me (I was actually able to<br/>\n&gt;twist three, I&#39;ve played this Bard so much).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 53 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
