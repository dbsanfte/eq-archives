It&#39;s hard to <br/>\n&gt; describe where he is located, but I can tell you he roams a short corridor <br/>\n&gt; above the Foreman&#39;s room. There is a goblin placeholder there most of the <br/>\n&gt; time. The corridor has a door that leads to a room with stairs. Down the <br/>\n&gt; stairs and back around to the right leads to the Foreman&#39;s room.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  The shard is a uncommon/rare drop, kobold hide boots are the common.<br/>\n  I would guess the kobold is level 30ish.  He&#39;s definitely not as <br/>\n  tough as the greater kobolds in SolB.  The corridor he wanders in<br/>\n  is fairly close to the lavastorm entrance.
