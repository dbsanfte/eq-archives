I am currently a level<br/>\n11 bard hanging out around the Freeport area.  This is my 3rd character<br/>\nsince the commercial release, and also the highest level I have reached.<br/>\nPreviously I have played a Wizard and a Shadow Knight.  I abandoned both<br/>\nat 5th level because they are too &quot;high level&quot;.  By this I mean that they<br/>\nachieve their greatest &quot;power&quot; at higher levels.  A wizard with no pet is<br/>\nnot even a match for a magician of similar level until somewhere in the<br/>\nteens, root notwithstanding.  The SK was a nice choice, but not even close<br/>\nto a warrior&#39;s skill, and with only minor spells until the mid-teens as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards, however, struck me as powerful from the beginning.  It seemed like<br/>\nmy ability to mow through things whether alone or in a party would<br/>\ndramatically increase with each new song.  Up until 6th level, each new<br/>\nsong was fantastic, with the exception of the Jig of Vigor.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, now it seems the good songs and skills are few and far between.<br/>\nThe Whistling Warsong was an OK buff, but since it was only personal I<br/>\nused it rarely.  At 8th, it was hardly worth the boat ride to get the<br/>\nLullaby, and Elemental Rhythms at level 9 was rather pointless.  Then the<br/>\nmagic 10 hit, and I learned Dodge and the awesome Anthem de Arms.  AT 11,<br/>\nthough, I get the USELESS brass skill and the buggy or just plain weak<br/>\nCharisma booster.  Not exactly songs to light my fire.  12th, or course,<br/>\nyields the Bellow, a much sought after song.  Then I have to look forward<br/>\nto another &quot;don&#39;t memorize me, ever&quot; song or two, another Rhythm and the<br/>\nMagic Identifier (absolutely useless).  Honstly, the only 2 things I<br/>\nreally look forward to at all in the near future are the Sleep Song at 15,<br/>\nDual Wield at 17th, and the group invisibility song at 19th, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else noticed these &quot;bum&quot; levels, like 9th, 11th, and I am sure<br/>\nothers to come?  Are hih level bards even worth it?  I hate seeing posts<br/>\nlike &quot;I am 19th level and I still use Anthem de Arms and Hymn of<br/>\nRestoration almost exclusively&quot;.  It will be a long and boring wait until<br/>\nthe better abilities come, I am afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat say you high level bards?  Is there light at the end of the tunnel?<br/>\n<br/>\nPistov of Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n\t ___________________________________________________________<br/>\n\t|\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|  Tyger, Tyger, burning bright\t       \t\t            |<br/>\n\t|  In the forests of the night,\t       Marc Allie\t    |<br/>\n\t|  What immortal hand or eye\t       \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|  Could frame thy fearful symmetry?   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mallie@...\">mallie@...</a>   |<br/>\n\t|\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|           -William Blake-\t       \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|___________________________________________________________|</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
