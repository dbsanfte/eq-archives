He is a lvl <br/>\n&gt; 45 bard. Can anyone verify this info? I was not near him to <br/>\n&gt; test it out, and <br/>\n&gt; he blows alot of hot air at times.  So I just wanted to see <br/>\n&gt; if anyone else <br/>\n&gt; is experiencing this insane (that&#39;s not a complaint) rise in <br/>\n&gt; our bretheren&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; ability to heal with song.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This info blew my mind (not to mention irritated the hell out <br/>\n&gt; of my cleric <br/>\n&gt; gf, heheheh). I had never bothered to get this item because I <br/>\n&gt; knew that it <br/>\n&gt; was nerfed and worked only as well as a regular stringed <br/>\n&gt; instrument. I also <br/>\n&gt; hate Castle Mistmoore. =)  Whatever Verant was planning on <br/>\n&gt; doing with this <br/>\n&gt; item as far as magical properties, I NEVER expected this! <br/>\n&gt; Does this also <br/>\n&gt; mean our lvl 2 and lvl 48 DoT songs are that much more <br/>\n&gt; powerful? &lt;evil grin&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone, someone please test and post as I do not have the <br/>\n&gt; item available to <br/>\n&gt; do so myself. =(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bard of Kelethin of the 48th Chorus<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ???
