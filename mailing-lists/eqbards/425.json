Singing one, getting the<br/>\nshield up, then stop singing and starting another, then going back to the<br/>\nfirst song to keep that shield up.  Some call playing three like this<br/>\njuggling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always managed to pull it off, even at lower levels.  When you miss a<br/>\nnote, just immediately double click the icon you need again, should only<br/>\ntake a split second between each attempt until you get the graphical<br/>\npyrotechnics.  Doesn&#39;t seem that I miss notes that often, though, ever.  I<br/>\nheard charisma had more effect on songs than dexterity.  Dexterity, to me,<br/>\nseems like it would have an effect on more physical things like how often<br/>\none can get in blows with a weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm, how often is it your missing notes anyway?  Perhaps should test this<br/>\nwith lv 1 bard with low charisma/dexterity high charisma/dexterity.  The<br/>\nmanual says that bards need intelligence, but I don&#39;t believe this.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Andy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skimaster@...\">skimaster@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, May 03, 1999 7:12 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Twisting question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;what is twisting songs?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Illian </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
