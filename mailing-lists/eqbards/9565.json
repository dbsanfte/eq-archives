The big difference..as you mentioned..is the camping issue.<br/>\nObviously you don&#39;t have to camp for gear in Diablo.  If people don&#39;t watch<br/>\ntheir inventory and repair their gear and then lose the item that they may<br/>\nhave spent many, many hours camping...ouch.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard different stories about the hell levels.  Supposedly Verant<br/>\n&#39;accidentally put this code into the game?  And then decided to leave it<br/>\nthere as a feature?  Hard to believe.  Even harder to believe given Brad<br/>\nMcQuaid&#39;s past statements. One thing McQuaid has said..and I have probably<br/>\nrepeated here..is that he &quot;never said it would be an easy game&quot;.  Of the 3<br/>\nmajor MMORPGs (EQ, UO, AC) Everquest is probably the most difficult and the<br/>\nmost unforgiving for player mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Dark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dark@...\">dark@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 03, 1999 11:25 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: Undead drops in Kithicor (Re: [eqbards] Digest Number 482)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Dark&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dark@...\">dark@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only problem with this though is with items like jboots or quest<br/>\nitems.<br/>\n&gt; People who camped drelzna for hours upon hours or the new Ancient Cyclops<br/>\n&gt; are going to be very pissed when that item dissapears.
