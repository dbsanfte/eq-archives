Its secondary resist will be removed completely. It will have a longer duration. And it will require an instrument.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-The single target haste spells will be self-only.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will also be revising the bardic epic weapon. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis should all go live with the next patch, which for now we are tentatively scheduling for late next week.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Alan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, how lovely :).<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, am I confused or did Twilight already work at any time of day?  Also, I noticed that Caster&#39;s Realm says Twilight pushes the mobs, rather than pulls them ;P.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this means Jonthan&#39;s Provocation is now self-only, yes?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo<br/>\n55 Bard of Deadly Virtues<br/>\nMithaniel Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
