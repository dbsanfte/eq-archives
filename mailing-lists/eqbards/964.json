A few AC, +5<br/>\nCharisma, and it acts like a lightstone!  I&#39;ve been debating whether or not<br/>\nto discard my spiked collar for it (+3 strength) but I&#39;m thinking with<br/>\ndiscussions here I&#39;ll just start wearing that amulet.  Of course, it&#39;s a<br/>\nquest item, but I have a feeling the reward won&#39;t be as good as the quest<br/>\nitem itself.  (the quest-giver didn&#39;t like me much, few levels back when I<br/>\njust gave it to her, so who knows.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt comes off the poor undead knight, the one who wacks you over and over and<br/>\npleads with you to put him out of his misery, and is fairly easy to put<br/>\ndown... I must have killed him around level five before.  Back then, just<br/>\ndon&#39;t remember this pendant having the qualities it does now.  He is part of<br/>\na quest that can be found in the Qeynos temple.  He is in the Qeynos<br/>\naquaducts.  I remember encountering him roaming the main passages before,<br/>\nbut this time I found him -just- behind the secret passage near the &quot;beware<br/>\nthe ratslayer&quot; graffiti.  If you go back there, be careful though.  Further<br/>\nin a deathtrap.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
