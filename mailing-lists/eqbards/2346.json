My question is how do <br/>\nyou do it? I have switched off between 1H slash, 1H blunt, pierce and HtoH <br/>\nand now I am back about 15 points from my cap on all of them. I level before <br/>\nI can get even one of them up to my cap. Will this change as leveling gets <br/>\nharder or am I &#39;chasing the goose&#39;? Thanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nZendarin<br/>\nThe Wandering Minstrel<br/>\nFennin Ro (Sword-bard to the KTC)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
