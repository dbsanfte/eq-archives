It is a DMG 5 weapon. My<br/>\n&gt;Dragoon Dirk (DMG 6 weapon) in my off-hand hits for 15 often, but never 16. <br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt;is regardless of whether I fight at my present modified strength of 99, or<br/>\n&gt;whether it goes much higher with anthem. It may be an imparted strength <br/>\n&gt;bonus,<br/>\n&gt;as you will notice putting on a strength item increases your attack factor, <br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;it may be as a result of issue. My damage did not go up when I hit 20th, <br/>\n&gt;but it<br/>\n&gt;did a bit later. I started noticing these higher damages in the middle of <br/>\n&gt;L30.<br/>\n&gt;So was it L30, or was it the 2 Jagged Bands I swapped for my former 2 +2 <br/>\n&gt;str<br/>\n&gt;rings? I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;ll try a high cgreen con without the rings or<br/>\n&gt;something and let you know. The bottom line is that 2xDMG+1 does seem very<br/>\n&gt;accurate at lower levels, but not higher.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ariell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am interested in seeing what kind of dmg Shada can get with various <br/>\nweapons at 50th or any of our other high level bards.<br/>\nWith my claw I have hit up to 19pts, with shard or dirk (both 6 dmg weapons) <br/>\ni have hit for up to 23 pts, with staff of writhing up to 33, and with <br/>\ncrystalline blade i think 37.
