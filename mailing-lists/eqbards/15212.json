Missed notes is probably one of the easiest<br/>\nthings to test though - just get your stats in the<br/>\nconfiguration you want to test, turn on your logfile, then<br/>\nrapidly stop/start a song over and over.  Don&#39;t even wait for<br/>\nthe song to actually start playing, since you&#39;ll get the<br/>\nmissed note message afterwards.  Then count up the number of<br/>\n&quot;your song ends&quot; messages (successes), and compare with the<br/>\nnumber of missed notes (failures).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
