Normally we use charm on two similar blues and have them beat each<br/>\nother senseless.  Now what happens if you are unable to find 2 blues and<br/>\nyou really need to kill that Uber mob?  <br/>\n<br/>\nA few days ago me a level 27 bard and a my friend a level 29 wizzie<br/>\ndecided to kill Griffenne in hopes of me getting a wonderful bracer to add<br/>\nto my collection.  What I noticed was that after two or three successful<br/>\ncharms on the Griff, my wizzie friend was able to nuke 3 times in a row<br/>\nwith his biggest nuke with out being agroed against.  Now what can you do<br/>\nif you only have a uber blue and some greens.  Charm the blue a few times.<br/>\nHe will now be agro against you and will ingnore you completely.  Now find<br/>\na green mob that is as fast as the uber blue and charm it and get it to<br/>\nattack the uber blue.  What I found is a griffawn can take down a<br/>\ngriffenne in about 4-5 charms on the Griffawn ^_^.  Got my charm in that<br/>\nmanner.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nBard who will be heading to Rathe Mtns in search of a lambent stone for a<br/>\nwonderful Lambent bracer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 10 Nov 1999, Rokenn Swiftsong wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have taken the feedback from this list and the Concert Hall message board <br/>\n&gt; and put together a website with your collected wisdom.
