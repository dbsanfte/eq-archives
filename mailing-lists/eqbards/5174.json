Last night I couldnt even get Denons to start I missed notes 10 times<br/>\nin a row and finally erased it from my list and added a different song. ALL<br/>\nmy skills are over 190, my Dex is a base of 124, char is 110, there is a<br/>\nproblem. I am a level 38 Bard and I KNOW when something has changed with the<br/>\nway I play. So knock off the black helicopter crap, you dont have a clue<br/>\nwhat your talking about. This is a very serious problem in how the Bard is<br/>\nplayed, it means we cannot twist songs like we used to effectively. I cannot<br/>\ndepend on Chaining a fleeing mob like I used to be able to. In fact I find<br/>\nmyself anticipating that missed note, hovering over that hotkey waiting to<br/>\npush it again when I miss. Its too bad if you dont play enough to notice a<br/>\nhuge change like this, or arent observant enough to notice it, but dont tell<br/>\nus we are imagining things.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Keith G.
