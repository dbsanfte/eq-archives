Saturday Night in Runnyeye a<br/>\ngroup member got stuck in some boards near water. I memorized motion and<br/>\nblinked him out. COurse I blinked myself right into the boards but that&#39;s<br/>\nbesides the point. Fortunately the group member was also a bard so he<br/>\nmemorized it and blinked me underneath into the water. I then equipped my<br/>\nflute and blinked out down the passage.<br/>\n\tSure we could have used a succor/evac, but we didn&#39;t want to waste the time<br/>\ntravelling all the way back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: Roop Dirump [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Monday, August 09, 1999 9:32 PM<br/>\n8)To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n8)Subject: Re: [eqbards] Comments thoughts petitions -LONG-<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: &quot;Roop Dirump&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)The level 14 song DOES have a purpose.  With many lore items,<br/>\n8)and even a few<br/>\n8)non-lore items you receive a message about the item.  For<br/>\n8)instance, one ogre<br/>\n8)I happened upon once mentioned someone had given him a human<br/>\n8)head as a gift,<br/>\n8)and he wished to know whose it was.  With that song I was<br/>\n8)able to tell him<br/>\n8)the name of the disgusting little pet head he carried around<br/>\n8)with him.  The<br/>\n8)song is often useful for getting clues with quest items.  I<br/>\n8)once found a key<br/>\n8)and used the song to tell me it was a High Hold Strongbox<br/>\n8)key.  Many of the<br/>\n8)messages you get from items using this song have not been<br/>\n8)implemented yet<br/>\n8)(that&#39;s what pending lore means!).  Bards get a song to learn the lore<br/>\n8)behind the item, and though the lore might often be<br/>\n8)pointless, of course<br/>\n8)bards should know it!  So the song is good.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)Regardless, I use this song more often that Mellifluous<br/>\n8)Motion!  Now THERE&#39;s<br/>\n8)a song I see no purpose for!  It seems to function like the<br/>\n8)old D&D spell<br/>\n8)Blink, but for it to be useful at all I think it would need its pulses<br/>\n8)shortened.  Otherwise it&#39;s just a joke-song, and often a<br/>\n8)cruel joke at that.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)Roop<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a><br/>\n8)&gt;<br/>\n8)&gt;<br/>\n8)&gt;explain a bit later.
