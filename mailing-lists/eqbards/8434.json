He is a lvl <br/>\n45 bard. Can anyone verify this info? I was not near him to test it out, and <br/>\nhe blows alot of hot air at times.  So I just wanted to see if anyone else <br/>\nis experiencing this insane (that&#39;s not a complaint) rise in our bretheren&#39;s <br/>\nability to heal with song.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis info blew my mind (not to mention irritated the hell out of my cleric <br/>\ngf, heheheh). I had never bothered to get this item because I knew that it <br/>\nwas nerfed and worked only as well as a regular stringed instrument. I also <br/>\nhate Castle Mistmoore. =)  Whatever Verant was planning on doing with this <br/>\nitem as far as magical properties, I NEVER expected this! Does this also <br/>\nmean our lvl 2 and lvl 48 DoT songs are that much more powerful? &lt;evil grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone, someone please test and post as I do not have the item available to <br/>\ndo so myself. =(<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 48th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
