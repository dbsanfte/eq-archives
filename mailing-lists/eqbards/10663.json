If you bind at the East Freeport","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-118217790\">Personally I bind in the Arena if I can.  If I&#39;m already bound in Freeport,<br/>\nthen I might skip getting bound in the Arena.  If you bind at the East<br/>\nFreeport gates just North of Northern Ro, then you have to zone 6 times<br/>\nbefore you&#39;re in CT (E.FP, NRo, Oasis, SRo, Innothule, Feerrott, CT).  If<br/>\nyou bind in Arena you have to zone only 4 times (Lake Rathe, Rathe Mts.,<br/>\nFeerrott, CT).  However, swimming Rathe is time consuming even with high<br/>\nswimming (mine is maxed for my level), enough so that if I&#39;m in a hurry I&#39;ll<br/>\nmem Aria of Eagles and run over the lake twisting Selo&#39;s.  Then the jog<br/>\nthrough Rathe Mts. is kinda long and twisty if you don&#39;t know the way.  The<br/>\nzones from Freeport are fairly short well known by everyone so I suppose<br/>\nit&#39;s kinda a wash.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a trick that I learned going to CT from Arena.  I you bind in FP and<br/>\nneed to invis yourself to get back to your corpse in CT (which is quite<br/>\ncommon), you have to run to the bank and perhaps the bard guild from your<br/>\nbind point to buy a drum and flute - that&#39;s a lot of zoning unless you bind<br/>\nat the bank.  If you are bound in Arena then you can&#39;t get a flute.  Or can<br/>\nyou?  If you check the gypsy camp near the entrance to Rathe Mts. from Lake<br/>\nRathe you&#39;ll find that they sell bardic instruments.  If I&#39;m bound in Arena<br/>\nand need a flute to get to my corpse, I&#39;ll zone into Rathe Mts. and kill one<br/>\nor two lizardman warriors (extrmely green) with my fists and perhaps bellow.<br/>\nOne or two little lizzies usually nets me enough cash to buy a flute, and<br/>\noftentimes a drum too.  Or even easier, I often have a friend or two there<br/>\nat the Lake Rathe/Rathe Mts. zone fighting cyclops and such.  I just bum a<br/>\nplat off of them.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe experience in CT is amazing if you get into a good group pulling lizards<br/>\nnonstop.  Your rogue friend was camping ravenscale of course, but I do not<br/>\ndoubt that he went from 32-38 in two weeks.  I went from 30th to 34th in<br/>\nsomething like 10 days.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;Crier, one question I have, because a couple of my guildmates<br/>\n&gt; are in CZ and<br/>\n&gt; keep bugging me to &quot;Come on Down !&quot;-Do you get bound in Freeport<br/>\n&gt; or Arena? I<br/>\n&gt; am definately sick of High Keep- and saw my Rogue guild mate shoot from<br/>\n&gt; 32-38 in like 2 weeks I think.<br/>\n&gt; And how long does it take you to do the corpse run if you are in Freeport?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Scanna Swiftsinger<br/>\n&gt; 33rd Chorus<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxx Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
