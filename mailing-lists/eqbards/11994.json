Rapiers look like crap.  So do Scimitars.<br/>\n  It needs a unique special look.  In fact, I&#39;d like it to <br/>\n  have some sort of animation sequence.  (glowing, pulsing,<br/>\n  not flaming heh)  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe a Ykesha sword with a blue tint and small electricity<br/>\n  sparks hopping across the surface.  I mean they did mention<br/>\n  that their engine supports a full range of animated objects<br/>\n  and that they haven&#39;t taken full advantage of it yet.  But<br/>\n  then again, Verant + Something_that_sounds_really_cool = Soon.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Sometimes I think if they just add a little more flavour to<br/>\n  the game with neat effects or unique graphics I&#39;d enjoy it<br/>\n  a lot more. <br/>\n <br/>\n  I mean let&#39;s face it our songs can do one of a handful of effects:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Blue sparkles.<br/>\n  Gold flashes.<br/>\n  Orange pulses.<br/>\n  White shimmers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Did I miss anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Casters get shafted too:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Red shock shimmers.<br/>\n  Orange flames.<br/>\n  Blue sparkles.<br/>\n  Harmony/Bind effect.<br/>\n  Snare/Root/Speed effects.<br/>\n  Wind/Swarm/Drowsy/Dot effects.<br/>\n  ...etc<br/>\n  <br/>\n  It&#39;s just pretty lame visually to cast Shock of Lightning or<br/>\n  Careless Lightning and see red sparkles.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Back to bard related... I&#39;d like to see the hue of the sparkles<br/>\n  change based on songs.  Like the Psalm series, Warmth is orange<br/>\n  pulsed, Cooling is lightblue, Purity is green, etc.  Chant, <br/>\n  Anthem, Celerity, Berserk, Victory all look like I&#39;m a L1 bard.<br/>\n  You&#39;d think they could change the tint on them as you get better<br/>\n  songs.  Dreaming, again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
