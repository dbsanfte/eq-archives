This was done to <br/>\n&gt;prevent a certain<br/>\n&gt;abuses of the spell which involved chain casting levitate to reach areas <br/>\n&gt;which were not<br/>\n&gt;designed to be player accessible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To get your levitation spell renewed, you can click to dispel it (this is <br/>\n&gt;one of the<br/>\n&gt;few spells that everybody can click to remove). Once the spell has been <br/>\n&gt;removed, you will<br/>\n&gt;be able to have it renewed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bards were unintentionally hurt with these changes - their song will not <br/>\n&gt;overwrite its<br/>\n&gt;own levitate effect. This error will be fixed with the next patch. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
