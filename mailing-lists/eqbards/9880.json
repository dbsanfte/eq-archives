I am being driven NUTS by groups declaring<br/>\nthey will loot &quot;Alpha 4P or FS, autosplit OFF&quot;... Then watch while the<br/>\nlooter carefully avoids looting anything with a weapon till last and<br/>\nthen they declare &quot;Nuts, all silver and a rusty&quot; :(   ...of course an<br/>\nhour later your up for loot and the leader (Named Alphonse of course)<br/>\ndeclares &quot;I gotta go guys, great playing with you&quot; and disbands the<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n  Now I don&#39;t want to be a spoil sport but central loot collection and<br/>\nno split schemes seem to me to have too many bugs to allow to be used in<br/>\ngroups I am in. If you need money my opinion is &quot;Alpha auto on&quot; is the<br/>\nonly way to go !!<br/>\n   Moonflower Bllue, Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. I am in debt to a guild member up to 150p. Guilds help but this is<br/>\n&quot;business&quot; not family :)<br/>\n    Any great money making schemes appreciated :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The gems for these pieces plus guantlets<br/>\n&gt; has cost me 1000pp. Then it was time to kill more HG&#39;s for money as well as<br/>\n&gt; lambents, I was down to only a few gold in the bank! This leaves no room to<br/>\n&gt; pay for the lambent. Being guilded really helps though, just put out the<br/>\n&gt; call for an HG expedition and I had a mid 30s to 40s crew in route<br/>\n&gt; immediately for a profitable night. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
