Now<br/>\n&gt; at level 28 I find that almost every competent group that I join (maybe 7<br/>\n&gt; out of 10 of them) works this way without being instructed to, and better<br/>\n&gt; yet, most are now familiar with spells like Lullaby or the Enchanter&#39;s AE<br/>\n&gt; Mesmerization.  Yes, there are still groups that don&#39;t understand Lullaby<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; my level, but they&#39;re typically much more open to listening to and<br/>\nfollowing<br/>\n&gt; my suggestions.  My frustration at your level was the same - I&#39;d instruct<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; group and they&#39;d either ask me who made me God or ignore me altogether.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bards are second only to Enchanters for crowd control.  Even your beefy<br/>\n&gt; Troll and Ogre buddies are going to watch their life drain away with a<br/>\nbunch<br/>\n&gt; of blue and green mobs smacking on them.  A few startlingly fast deaths in<br/>\n&gt; Permafrost, Runnyeye or Guk and your friends will be all ears when you say<br/>\n&gt; you can do crowd control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t give up.  Keep explaining it to your groups so that they&#39;ll know how<br/>\n&gt; things work 10 levels from now.  It will pay off in a few levels when the<br/>\n&gt; tanks realize that their massive HPs only go so far, and the casters<br/>\nrealize<br/>\n&gt; how frighteningly fragile they are when the blue bar is heading South.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Crier Sharpsong - 28th song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Operaman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slider@...\">slider@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve almost given up on trying to perfect this (Lullaby) with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pickup groups<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at my level (16-19). Either nobody understands /assist, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t trust my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lullaby to work, or they just plain don&#39;t listen. After one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nightmarish pull<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (&quot;A Orc Warrior&quot;s and Priests along the west side of Oasis) in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which I died<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because nobody would let my mobs sleep, I pulled out the virtual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chalkboard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and went though it step-by-step:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) I type MEZ<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) Everyone /assist the puller<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3) Stay on one target until it is dead.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4) Healer watch my health as all the other baddies pound on me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; between naps<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Everyone said OK. The very next nasty pull I typed MEZ and watched as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everybody chose their favorite Orc and nobody assisted the puller. It<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; late so I said my goodbyes and shuffled home. I think it will take a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situation where this song noticeably saves lives before people will be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; convinced. Next time I try it I&#39;m going to make sure to Selo out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of there if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see a lot of /assisting going on. It only hurts the bard to stay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cause the mobs aren&#39;t going to leave him alone when they&#39;re awake.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The evening was fun and the xp was good, but I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; graduating to more mature groups where satisfaction comes from watching<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; good plan come together, rather than marvelling that we didn&#39;t die when<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; deserved to.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Operaman<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Meandering Maestro of the 17th Song<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; p.s.
