This is basically a short-term snare (never seen it<br/>\nlast more than the standard 3 ticks).  It is VERY useful for<br/>\nsnagging those monsters that like to run and bring back<br/>\nfriends, especially since the bard can &quot;cast&quot; it while chasing<br/>\n(spellcasters can&#39;t do that).  I think it was weakened<br/>\nrecently, as last night I had mobs I&#39;d chained breaking out of<br/>\nit frequently before the 3 ticks were up, and a couple times<br/>\nalmost immediately.  I&#39;d rarely seen that before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe L21 song is fun to play with, but it&#39;s not necessary.<br/>\nSave your platinum if you like.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
