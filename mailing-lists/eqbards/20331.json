While I don&#39;t agree with<br/>\nthe original post or even that there is a perfect group, notice that<br/>\nbards appear many times in most of the different groups proposed (and<br/>\nI CAN agree with that!).<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger<br/>\nThe Nameless<br/>\nBard of the 30th (and a half) Song<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Better (not perfect) groups are ones that include intelligent,<br/>\nmotivated people looking for fun that happen to get good xp and loot<br/>\nalong the way - my opinion of course.  And ANY class can fit into<br/>\nthat group.<br/>\n<br/>\n[SNIP]<br/>\nSubject: Groups<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my guild mates came across an interesting post on what someone<br/>\nthat was the best group to have Pre-Kunark and Post-Kunark. I have<br/>\nincluded most of the original post mostly for the poster&#39;s thoughts<br/>\non Clerics.  It is an interesting variation to say the least. I find<br/>\nit somewhat difficult to believe that this group is particularly<br/>\nviable but it obviously works for the guy that posted it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Snip&gt;<br/>\nSlight changes in the post Kunark age.<br/>\nPre-Kunark it was :-<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk<br/>\nRogue/Necro/Mage<br/>\nRogue/Necro/Mage<br/>\nShaman<br/>\nEnchanter<br/>\nDruid<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of dumb people would go with a Cleric but that was far less<br/>\nefficient, the death penalty was so low that a Cleric was an<br/>\nexpensive luxury that cost the group in terms of XP efficiency. That<br/>\nwas unless you needed the *convenience* of Res, to get a member back<br/>\nwhen they couldn&#39;t walk there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe others are self-explanatory. Monk pulls, Shaman Togors, Enchanter<br/>\nmezzes any extras while the machine section go to work with<br/>\n*mana-free* mel├®e damage. I.e. no downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis group can go anywhere, do anything and it does it with *zero*<br/>\ndowntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Kunark age, there are a couple of differences :-<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk<br/>\nRogue<br/>\nRogue<br/>\nShaman<br/>\nEnchanter<br/>\nCleric<br/>\n<br/>\nOver level 60, the death penalty is just too great. It removes the<br/>\nefficiency of not using a Cleric. Plus Damage Shields are near<br/>\nworthless on Turgur&#39;d mobs (Druids are big losers in Kunark).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other change is that the new Kunark weapons mean the Mage and<br/>\nNecro can&#39;t keep up with the Rogue any more. Which is kind of ironic,<br/>\nIMHO. Rogues are probably the most over-powered class in the game -<br/>\nand they are going to get buffed more. Of course, their penalty is<br/>\nthey can&#39;t solo. At all. But at 55 plus, there is no soloing any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main problem with this group now is that you don&#39;t have a travel<br/>\nspell. This doesn&#39;t really matter for combat (evac is for kids), but<br/>\nit can be an inconvenience if, for example, you are a group of<br/>\nfriends wanting a long term party.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you *don&#39;t* want in a good group :-<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic based damage - can you say Downtime!<br/>\nHybrids strike 1 - piss poor mel├®e damage output.<br/>\nHybrids strike 2 - huge experience penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nA *good* Bard, i.e. one that puts away the stupid weapons and uses<br/>\ntheir DoTs with instruments, managing mob agro properly, can add the<br/>\nto group. But most Bards are clueless schmucks, so it isn&#39;t worth<br/>\ntrying to educate them as they flail away with their Yaks and no<br/>\nDouble Attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nEduin<br/>\n&lt;End&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeisler Grimstone<br/>\n29th Lvl Cleric of Brell<br/>\nArmigers of Mirth, E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n[End]<br/>\n<br/>\nPPS:  I like to think we here aren&#39;t most Bards.  With what I read<br/>\nhere and try in game, I know I have a lot to learn yet, but I hope<br/>\n(and try) to adapt to each group and be the best I can.

There is no &quot;perfect group&quot;. It is all situation dependant.<br/>\nHere&#39;s a group that I never thought would work (everyone around 40th<br/>\nlevel):<br/>\n<br/>\nbard<br/>\nbard<br/>\ncleric<br/>\ncleric<br/>\ndruid<br/>\nenchanter<br/>\n<br/>\nBard mana songs stack with each other and clarity so mana recovery<br/>\nwas VERY fast. We were fighting undead so the clerics could act like<br/>\nwizards. We could fight three mobs as once with no tanks and no<br/>\nmezzes and could handle up to 7 with mezzes (since the clerics could<br/>\nblast so well). And we were able to fight in a dangerous place since<br/>\nwe had so much crowd control and evac. The bards have a bad xp<br/>\npenalty but we killed things FAST.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother awesome group:<br/>\n<br/>\nwarrior<br/>\nmonk<br/>\nshadowknight<br/>\nrogue<br/>\nbard<br/>\ncleric<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the warrior taunting the cleric Complete Healing there was very<br/>\nlittle downtime. During combat the bard would charm (if 2 pulled) or<br/>\ndot/heal/buff. Maybe a monk would have been better than the<br/>\nshadowknight (leaving the bard to snare) but it&#39;s the same idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can make a &quot;perfect&quot; group if you are a group of friends<br/>\nwho need to be able to handle any situation. Or maybe you just want<br/>\nto go to unrest with 6 necromancers.<br/>\n<br/>\nRudo of Bertoxxulous<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 4<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 27 Jun 2000 14:50:56 -0700<br/>\n   From: &quot;Lemac Justerian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lemac@...\">lemac@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: These are a few of my fav-o-rite groups!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my favorite groups!<br/>\n<br/>\nBard - Singing Mana song and such<br/>\nBard - Ditto<br/>\nEnchanter - Clarity, mezzing, charming, etc.<br/>\nCleric - Healing, buffing (no need for res&#39;s, right?  hehe)<br/>\nWarrior - Tank, tank, tank...<br/>\nMonk - Pulling and tanking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBard<br/>\nCleric<br/>\nEnchanter<br/>\nMagician - Pets, etc..<br/>\nMonk<br/>\nDruid - More buffs, SoW, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nJust too bad they can&#39;t all be high elves... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLemac Justerian<br/>\nCleric on Karana<br/>\nProud member of Platinum Sphere Guild<br/>\n<br/>\n[End]<br/>\n<br/>\nPPSS: I don&#39;t have mana song yet, but I sure get asked a lot.
