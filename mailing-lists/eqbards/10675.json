I<br/>\n&gt;would love to get rid of my Barbed Leather Whip, but to replace it with<br/>\n&gt;what? If I could dual wield PGTs, that would be good, but they are still<br/>\n&gt;relatively slow, heavy, and only do 6 damage. The only viable replacements<br/>\n&gt;that I know of are way too expensive/hard to get. (Kilij, Crystalline <br/>\n&gt;Blade,<br/>\n&gt;Runed Falchion, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well like Harmonic posted already you have the benefit of being on a mature <br/>\nservers.  At 20th level on a non-mature server I had a combine rapier and a <br/>\ncombine dagger as my main weapons.  Barbed Whips were around, but were trade <br/>\nonly and very rare.  FYI at 39th I just got a Runed Falchion this weekend :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The same goes for armor. I have been wearing bronze for quite awhile, and <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;is a strain for this little wood elf, but to upgrade to steel is cost<br/>\n&gt;prohibitive, and lambent is way too hard for me, yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, I have had basically the same equipment for months, and with nothing to<br/>\n&gt;look forward to for another few months.   *sigh*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again on armor at 20th I was wearing a mix of Banded, Bronze, and a few <br/>\nmagic pieces (spiked leather colar, etc). And I was well equiped (due to <br/>\nbeing a merchant bard).  I was able to get full steel by 29th.  Again on a <br/>\nmature server it is not uncommon to see bronze sold for as little as 1 plat <br/>\nper AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If I am overlooking something, I would love to hear about it. I would <br/>\n&gt;dearly<br/>\n&gt;love a quest that was long and arduous but possible for me to accomplish,<br/>\n&gt;that would result in a nice weapon or magic instrument.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And speaking of instruments, if there were some better instruments around,<br/>\n&gt;maybe I wouldn&#39;t have to rely on my poor melee skills so much. I would love<br/>\n&gt;to sit back and play songs during melee, as I don&#39;t have the HPs to really<br/>\n&gt;mix it up anymore anyway, but it&#39;s just not quite enough for me as I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;seem to be able to weave 4 songs at once.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And all these balance issues, while significant, don&#39;t take into account<br/>\n&gt;twinking, which is the biggest unbalancing factor, I think. Of course, with<br/>\n&gt;the scarcity of attainable items and the game bias against those of us who<br/>\n&gt;prefer to solo, I can see why eBay sales are so brisk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Aranlas Starchaser<br/>\n&gt;Master Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At the risk of sounding like an old coot, you youngins today do not know how <br/>\neasy you have it :)  In my day..... hah<br/>\nAnd the game is always changing, hopefully more mid level items will by <br/>\nadded.  I still crinch when I remember that the day AFTER I spent 220 plat <br/>\non a Well balanced Rapier, the Ornate Dagger was changed into the Dragoon <br/>\nDirk.  Then I found that the WB Rapier would only sell back for 45 plat, <br/>\naarrrrgggghhhhh.  I did manage to trade it for a runed bone fork though :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
