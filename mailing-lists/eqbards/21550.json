I am in SK now and plan just to run over<br/>\nto Queynos and take a trip to Erudin while I am not in Kunark.  Also, thanks<br/>\nfor sharing your kite areas.  I am just starting to do OT and find it works<br/>\npretty well there, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my next question - just keeping the list active =).  I have some<br/>\nLambent(Helm, gauntlets and bracer) and plan to get the rest.  Yeah, varied<br/>\nopinions on if it is the &quot;best&quot; armor for us, but I want to at least have<br/>\nthe look for a while.  My query is on options on my other armor - cloak,<br/>\nrings, earrings, neck, face, etc.  I have a jagged band, a +7 Cha ring, a<br/>\nsplintered bronze cloak, 2 oppoline Cha earrings and some + Cha necklace,<br/>\nSplitpaw maybe.  I have been lucky in FM and have used pp from my two loops<br/>\nto purchase a MM drum (800) and currently have my remaining stash (1300ish)<br/>\nburning a hole in my pocket.  I have most of the gems already for my<br/>\nLambent, so I don&#39;t need to spend for them.  My weapons are Obsidian Shard,<br/>\nPugius, Dragoon Dirk in range slot and I use Gnoll Hide whips to keep up 1HS<br/>\nand use for stunning casters.  Lately, I have been using the shard in my<br/>\nprimary hand and the whip in my off hand - fun to burn and stun at the same<br/>\ntime - that&#39;s when I use weapons at all as my melee does not compare(as we<br/>\nall know).  I really want to upgrade my cloak and maybe my neck, but if you<br/>\nhave other suggestions for my other slots, please share them with me(face<br/>\nWILL be the mask one day).  Include your opinion of ball park value(I know<br/>\nit varies server to server) and where I could find it if I just traveled<br/>\nthere(assuming I can camp there or maybe I can do it in my future) and any<br/>\nstats you can remember.  Again, thanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger<br/>\nWood Elf Bard of the 34 Songs<br/>\nOfficer of Unity of Spirits<br/>\nThe Nameless</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
