Especially after adding in the extra dammage you do from punching.<br/>\nThe Warsong speeds you up the same (about 25%) so you will still swing<br/>\nroughly the same speed, figure 50% of weapon dmg (depending on what you&#39;re<br/>\nusing, could be as low as 25%).  The Hymn, with a Lute is VASTLY more<br/>\nefficient.  Almost completely negating dmg you take from 1 creature at that<br/>\nlevel.  Even at 20th with a lute I could take 2, and sometimes 3, blue/white<br/>\nand even yellow con mobs at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry it out, all instrument is really the way to go when solo or in a 2<br/>\nperson group.  3 or more I tend to break out weapons depending on group<br/>\nmakeup.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!!!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 15, 2000 1:55 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Race to 60 (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Kevin L.

A challenge!  (Actually the challenge will be to get to 20 before<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; wide world of EQ comes crashing down due to all it&#39;s players movign on to<br/>\n&gt; other games)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  hehe and she spends HOURS just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; frittering time away<br/>\n&gt; &gt; talking to folks ;)  She loves the social aspect of the game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I keep trying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to tell her this isn&#39;t MiRC but she loves to chat :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My game time is spent mostly fishing, drinking, delivering mail, and<br/>\n&gt; retrieving corpses - sometimes not even my own!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kudos on 11th!  Have you tried the all-instrument twist of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hymn/Disonnance/Warsong?  (punching of course)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.  And no, but I did dust off Disonnance for the first time in ages<br/>\n&gt; last night.  I hadn&#39;t used since, oh, level 4, except as an initial taunt<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; get a mobs attention.  But last night I found a nice open area (WC, near<br/>\nEC)<br/>\n&gt; and a mob I knew I could take (giant spider) and tried the ol&#39; wince tune<br/>\n&gt; for laughs.  I am TOTALLY sold on the HoR/CoD/JWW medley now.  I&#39;d have<br/>\n&gt; tried it with the lute except I couldn&#39;t rightly tell how much damage CoD<br/>\n&gt; was doing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Peace<br/>\n&gt; Evulia, bard of 11 songs, Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Save 75% on Products!<br/>\n&gt; Find incredible deals on overstocked items with Free shipping!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4013/10/_/451022/_/958413477/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4013/10/_/451022/_/958413477/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
