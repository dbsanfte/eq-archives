I am one of the <br/>\nmore popular 2nd wave bards on our server.  No one has ever<br/>\nquestioned my tactics, and I have people immediately asking<br/>\nme to join up with them.  Druids and rangers are NOT typically<br/>\nextremely intelligent people, and either like to pure melee<br/>\nor pure burn/heal.  The bard has always been stuck with making<br/>\nmany songs work to their advantage, where other classes specialize<br/>\nin one or two areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Druids don&#39;t group much.  They solo anything they can.<br/>\n   I&#39;ve been in group with druids about 5% of the time I<br/>\n   play EQ.  And half of that 5% was with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Rangers are melee people.  Their spells are for the extra<br/>\n   utility perks.  They are not the best casters, I often see<br/>\n   the snare spell cast (the green/yellow flying circles) and<br/>\n   almost always see a full resist.  (ie: no snare message)<br/>\n   I don&#39;t have time to wait for the snare to kick in.  I<br/>\n   do not get resisted that often on chains.  I miss more notes,<br/>\n   than I get resists.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) In the last two weeks, my steady group DOES NOT have a<br/>\n   druid or ranger.  Tactics change based on the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n...and all this speculation about breaking out of chains,<br/>\nI think you should get your bard to level 23 and then come<br/>\nback to the table, J.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn cazicthule, I can chain blue defenders/sentinels and it lasts<br/>\nthe whole battle (~20 secs), without reapplication.  Yellow/Red<br/>\nzealots, judicators... different story... however, once I chain<br/>\nthem near the end of the battle - they do not move.  This may<br/>\ntakes four or fives resists, but the end goal is to stop runners.<br/>\nAnd I accomplish this without ANY problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 30th drummer.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
