Now it does not perform like the high level song of <br/>\ncourse, but many of my friends swear by it. We noticed this in beta and it <br/>\nwas widely debated, but many have told me they see a difference. Next time <br/>\nyou are in a group, try it while the casters are medding and see if they can <br/>\ntell a difference.<br/>\nBrilinnia, a Bard on Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
