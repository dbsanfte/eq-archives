Dont fear your str much as the more you level the less its a<br/>\nbiggy.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy base str is 85 and im up to 98 now (one of my lower stats)<br/>\nmy base str  with my items on me is 62 and im in full steel (visible) and<br/>\nhave 2 silver plated bracers (7ac, 7disease/7poison resist and weight is<br/>\nminimul on em).  so right there i can loot a nice amount of stuff, but as i<br/>\nsaid the more you level the better you&#39;ll be off, im 30 and have a box of<br/>\naku-bar (weightless items in it and holds 10 slots) and got an evil eye bag<br/>\n(reduces weight 75%) so my weight rarely goes over 75 (damn coppers are<br/>\nheavy)<br/>\n<br/>\njewelry i have on is mostly dex/agi/charisma oriented.   you may want to get<br/>\na blackened crown to raise your str of 5 and all resists by 5 as well.  If<br/>\nyou can get the 2 ogre heads in butcherblock then you have a good chance of<br/>\ngetting a crown by completing the quest in kaladim, thats how i acquired my<br/>\ncrown when i had one.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy stat boosting items are:<br/>\ncrested helm   (6str/3char)<br/>\noppaline earing  (5char)<br/>\n4str/2int earing (4str/2int)<br/>\ngolden black pearl choker  (7dex/7agi i think, cant remember)<br/>\nPlatinum Star Ruby veil (soon to be replaced by a guise of deceiver i hope)<br/>\n(9dex/9char i think)<br/>\nelectrum Star ruby ring (7dex/5char)<br/>\ngold star ruby ring  (5dex/7char)  (one of each metal as one is 7dex 5 char<br/>\nand the other is opposite)<br/>\nsilver plated bracers (low weight, look like plate and 7 resist<br/>\npoison/disease)<br/>\ncloak of the icebear (i forgot the stats)<br/>\nbloodstained mantle (i forgot the stats)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you see most of my stuff is charisma and dex and some agi<br/>\nim at 98str<br/>\n119 charisma<br/>\n124 dex <br/>\nand 121 agi i think<br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno if this helps you any, but might give you ideas what to keep an eye<br/>\nout for. the plat star ruby veil is much cheaper to make then the plat ruby<br/>\nveil as the star ruby is only 68pp or so.<br/>\nthe 3str earings usually go for about 30-40pp each.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDont worry too much, you will start making money, just give it time. I know<br/>\ni remember vividly the high teens low 20&#39;s and i would never loot anything<br/>\nbut money almost cause i was always encumbered. it sucks i know but that<br/>\ntime will pass and you will start getting nice boosting items and the armor<br/>\nyou&#39;re seeking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin Nehoc<br/>\nSol ro<br/>\nForever 30th<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tMichal Hobson [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSeptember 8, 1999 1:52 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\tEQBards<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] Help!! I need advice!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hail and well met fellow bards of Norrath,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I come to you today with several small problems looking for assistance and<br/>\n&gt; advice.  When I first joined this list, you all seemed to think that the<br/>\n&gt; major component of a bard&#39;s attributes was Charisma, so on all of the<br/>\n&gt; suggestions I axed my human bard with low charisma (who&#39;s body I could not<br/>\n&gt; recover anywho) and made my half-elf bard with a whopping 110 starting<br/>\n&gt; charisma.  Anyway.....<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; That has now come back to bite me in the ass.  I am now at level 20<br/>\n&gt; (FINALLY!!!!!!) and am in search of bronze plate.  Unfortunately, med<br/>\n&gt; bronze seems incredibly rare (and expensive-I still haven&#39;t found the cash<br/>\n&gt; cow that everyone talks about hehe) to purchase.  So I am now in<br/>\n&gt; Permafrost where the bronze lives.  So now I have 3 pieces-breastplate,<br/>\n&gt; sleeves (vambraces, whatever) and a mask.  Only problem is that now I am<br/>\n&gt; only 10 from my total carrying weight (which is a whopping 82 buffed).  I<br/>\n&gt; plan on just getting the visible pieces, minus the boots-they just seem so<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable.  With a pair of greaves, one bracer and the helm, I shan&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; be able to carry anything anymore!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Here are my questions:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Please tell me of STR items it would be possible for me to get.  (I have<br/>\n&gt; one ring (I forget what kind) +2, and a purity belt, and a spiked collar.)<br/>\n&gt; Please bear in mind that I am poor (50pp in the bank on a good day) and I<br/>\n&gt; like to live.<br/>\n&gt; Also if any other people out there know off the cuff, who drops the<br/>\n&gt; greaves (bronze leggings) and the bronze helm in Permafrost.  Is it a<br/>\n&gt; named somebody or is it a random thing?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Thank you all in advance!<br/>\n&gt; Weiland Spellsong<br/>\n&gt; 20th chorus bard of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; Disciples of Truth </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
