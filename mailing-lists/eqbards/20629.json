Ok this is getting my attention.  I<br/>\npetition right away the gm&#39;s and send a tell to a guide (which ignored me<br/>\noutright)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, i got multiple petitions in over the night and no gm responded. I<br/>\neven talked to the gnome that had my name, was really weird feeling.  It&#39;s<br/>\npretty scary to know there&#39;s a newb out there with the name of your decked<br/>\nout character (decked out to me anyways).  About a couple months ago, my<br/>\nbard was renamed to MinkinX from Minkin just out of the blue, and now all of<br/>\na sudden he was back to Minkin. I have a feeling they fixed the problem with<br/>\nhim and now he&#39;s back to normal, but they forgot to remove the name from the<br/>\nname filter list or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s what i plan to do, i want to get him renamed completely incase<br/>\nsomething like this happens again as im getting paranoid. Anyone have a<br/>\nsuggestion for a new name? He&#39;s a wood elf if that gives you any more<br/>\nideas... What really pisses me off is that i made that bard in april 99,<br/>\nhe&#39;s been around for a long time, and seeing the name go will be a pain, but<br/>\ni&#39;d rather rename him then have him duped or lose him or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rakka 52 necro<br/>\n-Minkin 36 bard<br/>\n-Tanqueray 13 warrior<br/>\nSol Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
