No Bards.  And even with six bards in the guild level 45 and up, we&#39;re having a hard time arguing<br/>\nthe point.  We&#39;re *supposed* to be the most powerful *grouping* class in the game, but our songs have been<br/>\nnerfed to the point where, even in a *full* group, someone else does it better.  Have you seen the<br/>\ndiscussions on other boards where people are asked to list their ideal parties, or the player type they<br/>\nwould choose to group with first?  If we&#39;re the best grouping class, we should be way up on those lists,<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t we?  Instead, most people out there don&#39;t even put bards down as an alternate for the sixth<br/>\nslot!  I&#39;m getting a complex.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 45.8 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan Honeyman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   I don&#39;t feel we are keeping balanced with other classes, but<br/>\n&gt;   until we claim that - Verant will not see a problem.

When a group of<br/>\n&gt;   people hunting gods, dragons, etc can say &#39;We really don&#39;t need a bard<br/>\n&gt;   for this.&#39;, &#39;We need better tanks, and better healing, bards will just<br/>\n&gt;   lag us.&#39;, &#39;I would rather have a warrior with decent gear instead of a<br/>\n&gt;   bard.&#39; - something is seriously wrong balance-wise. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
