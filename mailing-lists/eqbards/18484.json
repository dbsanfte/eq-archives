I normally prefer grouping, but this<br/>\nlockup problem soured a few friendships I had - they thought I was<br/>\nungracefully bowing out of the fight :(  - so I&#39;ve been solo while trying to<br/>\nfix it. (The solution? Disable my SB Live!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Bard&#39;s at level 22.  I&#39;m in the Swamp of No Hope and soloing blues and<br/>\nwhites (Icebone Skeletons, Froglok Gaz Warriors, Man Eating Plants and Giant<br/>\nMarsh Leeches).  Spawns are plentiful and there&#39;s rarely more than 10 people<br/>\nin the zone at peak times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe experience is coming thick and fast.  I&#39;m using a Brazen Brass Kilij in<br/>\nmy main hand and a Silvery War Axe in the off.  Pull tactic is: Lament any<br/>\nsurrounding mobs (only necessary near Frogloks), Selo&#39;s in, Bellow to get<br/>\ntheir attention and pull back.  Then when I&#39;m in a spot clear of spawns,<br/>\nLargo&#39;s Melodic Binding, stack Chant of Battle and Whistling Warsong and<br/>\nalternate with Jig &#39;o Vigour to keep my stamina up.  I start Bellowing when<br/>\nthe beastie runs (Frogloks again), since lag sometimes means I&#39;m swiping at<br/>\nthin air.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
