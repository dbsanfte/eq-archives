Seems<br/>\n&gt; to me that most people here are actually adults.  :)  Anyway,<br/>\n&gt; enough patting<br/>\n&gt; on the back, I have a quick question.  Just made level 16 last<br/>\n&gt; night hunting<br/>\n&gt; in Crushbone.  I got a few more kills for insurance sake and set<br/>\n&gt; off to get<br/>\n&gt; the Ayre.  Went to High Keep, got the song, scribed it, memorized it, and<br/>\n&gt; went back to Faydwer.  My question is, what if I were to die<br/>\n&gt; enough to lose<br/>\n&gt; a level?  Would I lose the song completely, just not be able to<br/>\n&gt; memorize it,<br/>\n&gt; or what?  Haven&#39;t seen any discussion on this and was just wondering if<br/>\n&gt; anyone has experienced this yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you are on Veeshan give me a tell and say hi.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kurik<br/>\n&gt; 16th Bard<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (No witty description for Kurik yet)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Make your voice heard!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sign up for the ONElist Weekly Survey.
