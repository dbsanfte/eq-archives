I will occasionally add in the lev 2 song that makes the<br/>\nenemy &quot;wince&quot;<br/>\nbut its kind of dangerous and Im never sure if its helping much anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are some tips I can look forward to using at future levels?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, well...I was gonna ask about some weapons...but Ill put it in another<br/>\nmail to keep this thread pure.<br/>\n<br/>\nCerulia<br/>\nBard of 7.8 songs, Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
