At this level my bard has to almost all the time be in a group to<br/>\nadvance, without takeing 3 steps back for every one forward........ It is<br/>\nharder to get in a group and get established in a location if you have<br/>\nlimited time...... Ever tried to get in groups in HK, can take hour or more.<br/>\nWhich is why I have many characters in the mid teens, I can solo them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJaezebel Moonsong<br/>\nGypsy bard of the 24th song<br/>\nSpirit of the Moon<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Blair, Keith (Keith Blair) &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, October 04, 1999 10:09 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m going to have to agree Everquest is a game for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; people who have lots of time on their hands.
