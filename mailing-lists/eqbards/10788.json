I&#39;ve never had an obs shard.<br/>\n  The silvery axe is good.  It looks like you are set<br/>\n  on the staff.  There is a electrum bladed wazikashi,<br/>\n  but it&#39;s probably out of your league in obtaining it<br/>\n  unless you talk a level 50 druid into camping it for<br/>\n  4-8 hours, even then he&#39;ll probably want to twink his<br/>\n  own character with it after all that work, assuming<br/>\n  some buttonblasting wizard leaves the Caitliff alive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You really don&#39;t have many outlets for good weapons<br/>\n  until you dual Yks.  Rumor is they will disappear<br/>\n  soon, so the chances of getting those is getting<br/>\n  slimmer too.  Then again, rumors are just that - rumors.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My suggestion, stick with your old guns, and beg your<br/>\n  favorite druid to assist you in getting EBWs (7/21)<br/>\n  One of the best 1hs ratios in the game, better ratio<br/>\n  than a Yk, except no proc.  You&#39;ll begin to feel the<br/>\n  outshadowing of your melee the closer to 50 you get.<br/>\n  While I contribute a hefty amount of dmg, I see the<br/>\n  SKs and Pals doing 80-100 per round, and the warriors<br/>\n  around 100-150, and the monks 150+ (on a good day)<br/>\n<br/>\n  What are all the level 40+ people here wielding now?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
