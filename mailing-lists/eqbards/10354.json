You were one of the people I was<br/>\nthinking of with that tidbit. The rest of the tidbit was, I recall, &quot;and it<br/>\nseemed too soon to me.&quot; Emphasis on *to me*.

He had flooded<br/>\nthe market with crude steins with another character and was now reaping the<br/>\nbenefits. Like you, he had many hours of play time between his characters,<br/>\nhad earned a ton of pp, yet had no character above 20 yet. Others figured he<br/>\nwas a twink, but I was proud to say I hung out with the richest 17th lvl<br/>\nwarrior in Norrath. You both put your time in and earned what you have. I&#39;m<br/>\nhappy for you, brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point I was making was that I am not comfortable with the perception of<br/>\ntwinking. I enjoy being at or slightly above the power-curve for my level,<br/>\nbut I would be embarrased to display Lambent or rubicite before lvl 20. I<br/>\nsuppose it would be because I would feel compelled to explain why I deserved<br/>\nit. I&#39;d rather impress others with my actions, songs, and wit (and since I&#39;m<br/>\nnot wealthy, those are my only options &lt;g&gt;). That&#39;s just me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to justify yourself, Double. People will think what they want<br/>\nnomatter what you say. You earned your gear, you display it proudly and mock<br/>\nthose who question you. Your cocky personality fits perfectly with your name<br/>\nand your playstyle.
