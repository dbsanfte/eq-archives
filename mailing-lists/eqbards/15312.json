I may not<br/>\n  play Everquest again.  In short, the game was taking away time<br/>\n  I needed to spend working and most importantly taking care of<br/>\n  my girlfriend.  For almost 14 months (since beta 3) she has<br/>\n  endured 6-8 hour sessions of EQ on a daily basis.  Clearly,<br/>\n  the game came before she did in all cases.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Everquest wasn&#39;t that great either, I know I complained about<br/>\n  it often, but I&#39;d keep coming back for the people when I could<br/>\n  have turned and looked 5 feet beside me and spent time with <br/>\n  that one person who counted.  Everquest/Verant are full of<br/>\n  shortcomings and I kept hoping that things would finally get <br/>\n  &#39;fixed&#39; or &#39;work properly&#39; - but that was just a dream.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I want to play again, just not now.  Things are going very well<br/>\n  right now and I don&#39;t want to bring back the frustration that EQ<br/>\n  caused me.  I&#39;ll read the posts here where relevant, but I won&#39;t<br/>\n  post much.  I&#39;ve got big work projects demanding more and more<br/>\n  time.  I&#39;ve also got a kitten and a beautiful girlfriend demanding <br/>\n  more time as well.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to return and play the<br/>\n  length of time I once played.  But I hope to return soon, maybe in <br/>\n  a few more weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic Distortion, 50th unchained melody.<br/>\n  League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n  Innoruuk<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Ryan.<br/>\n<br/>\n  +=================================+<br/>\n  | Ryan Honeyman, Programmer      /<br/>\n  | Decipher, Web Group           /<br/>\n  | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.decipher.com\">http://www.decipher.com</a>      /<br/>\n  +-----------------------------+<br/>\n  | phone&gt; 757.664.1126        /<br/>\n  | pager&gt; 757.629.1567       /<br/>\n  +==========================+</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
