Therefore, connection speed <br/>\nis paramount. ;) Dial-up is one of the slowest connections you can <br/>\nhave (if you use AOL I pity you). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really want to spend the money, you could upgrade to DSL. It&#39;s <br/>\nroughly about the same price you&#39;ll pay for AOL (depending on where <br/>\nyou get DSL from), or if you have Cable service available, get that. <br/>\nDial-up transfers up to 56K per second. DSL and Cable are 10 times <br/>\nfaster than that and more if you have a good modem and cable.<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************<br/>\nJack Bullions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It works on dialup, but my boyfriend got cable modem to play <br/>\n </span></blockquote>recently and he LOVES it even more now, I am still stuck with dialup <br/>\nand see the different in speed and most defidently graphics.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  BADBRAD112 &lt;badbrad112@y...&gt; wrote:Hi everyone, i just wanted to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>ask some questions.
