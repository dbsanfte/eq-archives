In luck he droped they key! We<br/>\nmade our way to the second floor and headed to the<br/>\nHuman Shadow Knight, we got the jump on her But a skele<br/>\ndecided to help, so as Wyly (rouge) was battling the SK,<br/>\nme and Mylissa(wizard) finished the Skele with<br/>\nlittle trouble. Wyly got 2 bs in while the Sk was slowly<br/>\nbeing eaten away by my swarm. We then proceded to go to<br/>\nsee the Ugly Orge SK, not sure of the contents of<br/>\nthis room I put up a Shield of Barbs on all of us, we<br/>\nentered, Wyly got hit hard for about 1/5 health, Then the<br/>\nsk came over after a rather short time we dispatced<br/>\nthem with little ease, we check the orges corpse and<br/>\nboom, Barbed arms, I&#39;m sure someone in the guild could<br/>\nuse these.... So we progress into the lower depths as<br/>\nwe beat ghoul after Willowisp, we get hit with the<br/>\nworst thing that could happen in eq we all went LD at<br/>\nonce! we come back dead!&lt;br&gt;Remind me why I don&#39;t kill<br/>\nGM&#39;s?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
