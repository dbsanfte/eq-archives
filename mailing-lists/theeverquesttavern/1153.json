","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1347838328\">Cazic-Thule is a great spot. The easiest way is<br/>\nthrough South Ro. Find the southwest wall of South Ro -<br/>\nthere will be a zone line here. Zone into Feerrott.<br/>\nFollow the right wall closely. Stay only on the right<br/>\nwall and keep an eye out for a break in the wall. This<br/>\nwill be the zone in to Innothule. Come forward and<br/>\nfollow the left wall. You&#39;ll come to a river - swim<br/>\nacross. Once on the other side, you should see some<br/>\nstairs. Invis yourself if you can. Up the stairs is the<br/>\nentrance to Cazic-Thule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also good at that level is<br/>\nFrontier Mountains in Kunark. A bit hard to describe<br/>\ndirections - perhaps you could have a friend show you the<br/>\nway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51 champion of Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
