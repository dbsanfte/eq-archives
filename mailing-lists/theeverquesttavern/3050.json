I never wear <br/>\na lot of jewelry. It was a bracelet with dragons he knew I loved. I <br/>\nwas working on a site for a member (all I need are pictures). So, I <br/>\nlooked said it was really nice and finished up the HTML portion of <br/>\nthe links page even though I keep finding more helpful links that can <br/>\nhelp other people in our situation... <br/>\n<br/>\nhe thought I was upset and said he was going to wait but handed me a <br/>\nring. He stated it was the first part to the wedding set.
