Most sell<br/>\nfor around 10pp at auction if you have time, EXCEPT<br/>\nthe gloves (which have wis and dex bonus) can sell<br/>\nfor around 20pp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MAMMYs in Everfrost!! This is<br/>\nwhere I made ALL My money. Best if you are a ranger our<br/>\ndruid over lvl 20, but if not, get one of these to<br/>\ngroup with you. I started at lvl 25 and it was tough<br/>\nsoloing them, but i could do it and get xp all the way to<br/>\nlvl 30. Mammy&#39;s drop tusks, usually one, sometimes<br/>\nnone, but sometimes 2. After getting faction up in<br/>\nHalas and finding the right merchant, I was selling<br/>\nthem for over 9pp each. They are huge and heavy, so I<br/>\nwould fill up, run to town, sell and gate back for more<br/>\naction. Had several sessions making 100+ plat. If i had<br/>\nteamed up with a cleric, chanter or tank, it would have<br/>\nbeen faster XP, but I would have had to share the<br/>\ntusks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the 30s, there is no better place that<br/>\nRathe Mountains hunting giants. As with the Mammys,<br/>\nthere is serious competition for mobs here, and lots of<br/>\nhigh level soloers looking for easy cash. At level<br/>\n30-38ish, this area can be challenging for a group, provide<br/>\ngood xp AND a TON of money. Full group can get up to<br/>\n8pp each Plus FS weapons and the occasional<br/>\nmiscellaneous items. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kunark (LOIO, FM, OT) is one of<br/>\nthe best places for XP, but the loot there is<br/>\ngenerally random, rare and terrible. BUT-- if you don&#39;t<br/>\nlike to auction stuff, then Kunark is the place to<br/>\nhunt and be patient. When a Leg Chopper, Giant Tree<br/>\nFlayer, or armor drops from the giants, go sell it<br/>\nimmediately to a merchant. The above items sell for over<br/>\n30pp, with the large Foreman&#39;s tunic selling for 67pp<br/>\nlast i tried. Just gotta wade through all the tump<br/>\nstumps---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok-- there&#39;s a little info-- I always forget to throw<br/>\nin info for under 20s, because i can&#39;t remember what<br/>\nGOOD mobs i fought then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
