What I am <br/>\nlooking for is the craziest things you ever did that can be directly <br/>\nrelated to this game. I can tell you I have never played this game, <br/>\nbut I have a few friends that did, and some of the things they say <br/>\nthey did was call out from work sick, and play the game seven hours <br/>\nin one setting! These are the things I am looking for and my friend <br/>\nsuggested that if they did it, then there are countless others out <br/>\nthere that have done even more. I am also looking into how you got <br/>\nhooked on playing this game. Did someone lend you a copy? Play it <br/>\nover a friend&#39;s house? Also, please note that I am not bashing <br/>\nanybody here - I am a video game addict myself. I admit I love to <br/>\nplay them, and spent countless days playing Final Fantasy into the <br/>\nearly hours of the morning. I hope you guys and girls can help me <br/>\nout. Thanks again!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
