Did you sign up for a feature or anything like that?<br/>\nHave you asked for an itemized statement for what they say you owe?<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nNo wonder Ebay makes to much money. I list &quot;ONE&quot; item for sell <br/>\nthinking the price they say it is $15 and change and I get a bill for <br/>\n(&quot;Non-Payment of $132.86 Balance on your eBay account&quot;). These people <br/>\ngo ripping other people off. I will never use their service again and <br/>\nI would hope other people don&#39;t end up in my situation!
