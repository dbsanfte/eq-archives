Apparently, it<br/>\ndepends if you got an envelope, or a backpack. I _think_<br/>\nthe backpack toes to Ton Twostring, and the envelope<br/>\ngoes to Felisity Starbright. I could be wrong,<br/>\nhowever. But I&#39;m pretty sure that mail goes to those<br/>\ntwo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think you&#39;re safest giving it to Ton. Mail from<br/>\nthe Feerrott and Innothule Swamp, however, does go to<br/>\nFelisity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ah, here are comments from two spoiler<br/>\nsites:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not sure you CAN deliver mail to Felisity<br/>\nSTarbright in the bard guild in Freeport. I&#39;ve tried twice<br/>\nnow to give her mail from Idia in the bard&#39;s guild in<br/>\nKelethin and neither of the times have I gotten the<br/>\ncorrect response, just the oh i don&#39;t know what to do<br/>\nwith this but thanks bit. Does anybody else have this<br/>\nproblem?&quot; (Yes, I&#39;ve messed that up.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this:<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Deliver all pouches of mail for Freeport to Ton Twostring<br/>\n(he&#39;s the one that gives pouches of mail for other<br/>\ncities). Deliver all letters for Freeport to Felisity<br/>\nStarbright. This is regardless of what the NPC who gave the<br/>\nmail told you to do. At least one NPC tells you the<br/>\nwrong person to deliver to.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note the difference<br/>\n-- pouches to to Ton, letters to Felisity. Good<br/>\nluck, and let us know how it goes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
