It really<br/>\nsucks when you are semi-high level when people SHOULD<br/>\nknow there roll in the group. You designate a healer<br/>\nand they waste precious mana nukeing or tanking,<br/>\nnukers who waste nukes on greenies the tank can handle<br/>\n=P all this results in a lot of wasted down time. If<br/>\nyou read my Cazic-Thule fighting reccomendations you<br/>\nknow that I only nuke once per lost tank bubble. Keeps<br/>\nthem from aggroing on me....most of the time. I also<br/>\nuse Screaming Terror on extras if I can get to them.<br/>\n(mez spell) At level 33 my group had people who didn&#39;t<br/>\nfollow group proceedures ( a guy who wasn&#39;t the<br/>\ndesegnated puller pulling crap). I hear the tank say ZONE<br/>\n(he was our evac caller) so I hit harmshield and ZOOM<br/>\nout of the Tae room. I manage to zone, utterly oom<br/>\nbut with a full health bar, and the idiots in the<br/>\ngroup yell at the tank and I for running (we lived they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t) sorry boys and girls but when the person we all<br/>\nagree on to yell run actually assesses the situation<br/>\nand knows we are going to die if we don&#39;t zone yells<br/>\nrun, then you better run! Hesitation will kill you AND<br/>\nthe tank who has to pause to save your ass while<br/>\ntelling you &quot;@(&*^@ I SAID ZONE!!!!&quot; Running isn&#39;t<br/>\nfun....but better YOU die than me for your<br/>\nstupidity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;well there is my rant =P~~~~~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next time your<br/>\nfriend pulls something you KNOW you can&#39;t take DON&#39;T hit<br/>\nit! Tell him to run to the zone. If you don&#39;t touch<br/>\nit, it won&#39;t aggro on you if you get out of the way.<br/>\nIt&#39;s no fun to watch a friend die but it&#39;s his own<br/>\nfault.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aeday Femmefatel &lt;The Dark Lords&gt;&lt;br&gt;level 34<br/>\n(got it last night in Cazic) DEL Necro&lt;br&gt;Xegony<br/>\nserver</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
