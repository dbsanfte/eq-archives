There are more<br/>\nthan 60 race/class combinations that can all be very<br/>\ninteresting, useful, and fulfilling. In choosing your<br/>\ncharacter, consider things like whether you want a fighter,<br/>\na healer, or a caster, or a combination of these.<br/>\nAlso, choose whether you wish to be a good race or an<br/>\nevil race. After deciding these, there are still many<br/>\nother choices to choose from. Probably the best thing<br/>\nto do if you cannot choose a single character you<br/>\nlike best is to try a few of them and then decide what<br/>\nyour favorite is(You have 8 character slots per<br/>\nSERVER, meaning you can make more than a hundred<br/>\ncharacters total over various servers ;) ). Keep in mind,<br/>\nmost classes are very similar at earlier levels, you<br/>\nprobably won&#39;t recognize the advantages of them for a few<br/>\nlevels. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;One other thing I wish to mention, don&#39;t<br/>\nworry about the statistics and numbers, choose the race<br/>\nyou like the best despite the fact the stats may seem<br/>\nall wrong for the class. Gnomes have the worst stats<br/>\nfor a cleric than any other race, but I still love<br/>\nplaying a gnome cleric and I&#39;m just as useful to a group<br/>\nas a dwarf cleric =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have fun choosing your<br/>\ncharacter, it will effect the rest of your characters life<br/>\nso make sure you enjoy it!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
