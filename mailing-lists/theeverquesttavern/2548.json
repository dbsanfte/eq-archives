I have <br/>\nvery low HP as a lvl 40 druid, but that&#39;s ok. I rarely get hit, and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t melee at all. If I agro, I count on the tanks to taunt off me-- <br/>\nor I snare/root and back off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your char picks-- the first two are standard fare and hard to <br/>\ndisagree with (thought I chose a wood-elf druid). The Troll Warrior <br/>\nis a great choice, but Most would say that Ogre warrior is THE best. <br/>\nOr Barb Warrior, for good races.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point I think we&#39;ve made here is to have fun with your char <br/>\nchoice-- there are items along the way that will increase your key <br/>\nstats.  I suggest strongly looking at where you put your initial <br/>\nstats though--- NOT putting points into WIS if you are a priest, or <br/>\nINT if a pure caster is foolish (from experience he speaks). STR, STA <br/>\nand DEX are key to mellee classes-- and don&#39;t forget about some added <br/>\nCHA for bards and chanters.  Who really knows the benefits of AGI?  <br/>\nGood stat to increase if you are a soloing caster/hybrid class that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to take as much damage i guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., bullions27 &lt;no_reply@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I guess it depends how long you intend to play for. If I had my <br/>\nchoice <br/>\n&gt; over again, I would put everything into STA, regardless of class. <br/>\n&gt; There are plenty of items out there that will boost a myriad of <br/>\nyour <br/>\n&gt; stats.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And, there are really no races that are superior over the other in <br/>\n&gt; their classes. Equipment really make or break a class. For starters <br/>\n&gt; though, the best race with overall stats IMO would be:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enchanter - Erudite<br/>\n&gt; Druid - Halfling<br/>\n&gt; Warrior - Troll<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enjoy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., ravens_sorrows wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmm..ok here&#39;s a question then? Since I know that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I will be playing within a month to two months I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; need to have a char, just in case my others are wiped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out. So I am thinking Enchanter, Druid and yes the all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around basher Warrior. My question is this then. When<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you start the char they ask you to put the points in,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so what is a good distrubition of these stats for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each char type listed here? Also for these char thypes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what are the better races? (I know for war the best is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Troll &#39;cause they get regen, but the faction sucks so I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might just go with Human.) Hmm..can&#39;t think of anything<br/>\n&gt; &gt; else so I guess I&#39;ll go for now. *yawn* have to get up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; early for work tomorrow. Night.
