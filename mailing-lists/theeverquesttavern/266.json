Innoruuk&#39;s Bane is a guild devoted<br/>\nto conquest against evil and hatred all over<br/>\nNorrath. Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves, Shadowknights, and<br/>\nNecromancers all stand for virtues that are against those of<br/>\nInnoruuk&#39;s Bane and thus may not be members. As the name<br/>\nsuggests, the guild is primarily against the Tier&#39;Dal and<br/>\nwars with the Dark Elven race will be frequent and<br/>\nunmerciful. For all of those who feel the same way about the<br/>\nDarkness that is spreading over our beloved Norrath,<br/>\nplease post a message here saying so, or send a /tell to<br/>\nDurran, Jeruss, Oladahn, or Trellan on the Mathaniel Marr<br/>\nServer. May your heart guide you to the right choice so<br/>\nthat we may save our world from these horrendous<br/>\nevils!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trellan Hawksight, Wood Elf Ranger of 22 seasons.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
