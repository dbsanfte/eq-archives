Got called a &quot;dumb newbie&quot; over on Everlore&#39;s<br/>\nRogue discussion board for voicing my opinions on the<br/>\nsubject. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, no more, except for this one last<br/>\nthing (!). It is a matter of roleplaying, I think<br/>\n(don&#39;t worry, shooman, I still like you and like reading<br/>\nyour posts). Dang, it&#39;s really hard to verbalize this<br/>\n. . . OK, I have a Dwarf Paladin, 2nd level, who&#39;s<br/>\ncurrently camped next to the guards in Butcherblock. My<br/>\nDwarf Rogue, meanwhile (main character, now 11th level)<br/>\ncame across a bitchin&#39; Fine Steel Great Staff. He<br/>\ncan&#39;t use it, and it would be very easy to drop it for<br/>\nthe Paladin and a very cool item for her. But I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do that, because there&#39;s no &quot;logical&quot; reason<br/>\nfor her to find it, in the context of the game. It<br/>\nwould be contrived, and that would take away from the<br/>\npurity (integrity?) of my Paladin . . . Actually, I<br/>\n_could_ rationalize it -- I actually think of them as<br/>\nbrother and sister . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for every item that<br/>\nmy Rogue has, there&#39;s a story behind it that I<br/>\nremember, even those items given to me by others (which<br/>\nthey call &quot;handouts,&quot; not &quot;twinking,&quot; on Everlore).<br/>\nLike the Gnome who gave me the Tailored Whip and said,<br/>\n&quot;Go kill something with it, I want to see it in<br/>\naction.&quot; Or the fact that I bought my Dwarven Banded Mail<br/>\nwith the proceeds from selling a Lambent gem that I<br/>\ngot for guiding a High Elf through<br/>\nButcherblock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suspect this isn&#39;t making sense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But<br/>\nmaybe that&#39;s it -- roleplayers are perhaps less likely<br/>\nto twink, or at least twink in a less grandiose<br/>\nfashion. Like the guy (54th level Druid) who&#39;s going to<br/>\nbuy Ravenscale or Rygorr (sp?) for his new Gnome<br/>\nRogue. Good gosh, I don&#39;t even have any idea what that<br/>\nstuff is. Most people don&#39;t roleplay (shooman does, I<br/>\nknow from these boards), let&#39;s admit it, so it&#39;s a<br/>\ncase where many folks want to be able to play the game<br/>\nmore effectively, more quickly. Twinking allows<br/>\nthat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, OK -- if that&#39;s your gig, go ahead and twink. My<br/>\ngig is (role)playing a character, and filling out the<br/>\nstory of his life. To each his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>\nKaladim&lt;br&gt;11th level Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal&lt;br&gt;Who will never speak of<br/>\ntwinking again . . .</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
