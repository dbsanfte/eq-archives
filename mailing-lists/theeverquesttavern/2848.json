Doesn&#39;t matter what modem I use. The game plays okay on <br/>\nmy pIII 450 with 512 ram and a 64m vid card. It has some hiccups once <br/>\nin a while and I have to turn everything off in the bazaar to be able <br/>\nto have some control there. It&#39;s still laggy in the bazaar but I have <br/>\nno probs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second box is a p4 2.2g 512ram 128m vid card. It&#39;s also on the <br/>\nsame dial up (yes, only one at a time :( ) but I have NO lag with it. <br/>\nI entered the bazaar and forgot to turn everything off (100 percent <br/>\nclip plane emotes, animations etc) and I had less lag than I do with <br/>\nthe other box with all the options turned off.<br/>\n<br/>\nDial up zones slower than dsl/cable but I have no issues with the <br/>\ngameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nTimmye Cousteau<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In theeverquesttavern@y..., Meleficent Ouverts <br/>\n&lt;meleficent22@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dial-up?
