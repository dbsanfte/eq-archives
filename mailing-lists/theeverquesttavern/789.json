Here is how and why I personally<br/>\nuse each<br/>\none.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.castersrealm.com&lt;br&gt;Spells, jewelery, research, patch info, hot forum topics.<br/>\nI use this site a lot because I&#39;m an enchanter.<br/>\nAlso, the webmaster always posts summarized responses<br/>\nfrom Abashi (Gordon) on various hot forum<br/>\ntopics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.eqmaps.com&lt;br&gt;Weapon stats, maps, NPC mob info, and more. I use this<br/>\nsite all the time. This is #2 on my list only because<br/>\nthey don&#39;t have spell info, which I need. I personally<br/>\nbelieve this site has the absolute best layout, search<br/>\nfeatures, cross-referrencing, and updates. Amazing<br/>\nsite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;eq.stratics.com&lt;br&gt;The only thing I really use this site for anymore is<br/>\nthe &quot;Class Referrence&quot; page which lists the skills<br/>\nfor each class. Other than that, I never really visit<br/>\nanymore. I am not that interested in weddings, new guilds,<br/>\ntrade bazaars, and the other various community issues<br/>\nthat seem to constitute the bulk of this site&#39;s<br/>\nnews.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.maximumeq.com&lt;br&gt;Price refference. It might not be very accurate, but<br/>\nmany times it can give you a rough estimate. I also<br/>\nlike how the weapon/armor listings are listed from<br/>\nworse to best. You can sort the item searches on EQMaps<br/>\nvarious ways also, but sometimes Maximum EQ is just a<br/>\nquicker way of doing<br/>\nit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.brellserilis.net&lt;br&gt;I only use the forums here. But these forums are<br/>\nspecifically for Brell, my server. Many great discussions can<br/>\nbe found here regarding plain/dragon raids, big<br/>\nguild matters, etc. I encourage everyone to find the<br/>\n&quot;self-declared official&quot; board for their server and check it<br/>\nout.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;everquest.allakhazam.com&lt;br&gt;Quests. I like this site for quests because all the info<br/>\nis edited and placed by the webmaster. So all of it<br/>\nis either confirmed, or open disclaimed as a<br/>\npossible rumor. But if I can&#39;t find it<br/>\nhere...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.everlore.com&lt;br&gt;...I go here. I know some people that think this is<br/>\nthe best EQ site around. I think it&#39;s definately<br/>\ngood, but I prefer to go to various sites that<br/>\nspecialize in certain things. The Quest section on Everlore<br/>\nis quite expansive and up-to-date. Players<br/>\ncontribute driectly to the info. But I find it more<br/>\ndifficult to actually find the info I&#39;m looking for here.<br/>\nHalf of the posts in the quest section are questions<br/>\nabout (not answers to) some quest. And some answers<br/>\nthat you do find have a contradicting post from<br/>\nanother player on the same page. Kinda<br/>\nconfusing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eq&#39;Lizer - gameznet.com/eq/&lt;br&gt;I stopped going here after<br/>\nEQmaps got rolling. But every now and then you&#39;ll hear<br/>\nof some high level item that EQmaps hasn&#39;t added to<br/>\ntheir database yet. Then I&#39;ll check here. The guy who<br/>\nmaintains this site is a level 50 SK (I<br/>\nbelieve).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also check out various class-specific sites when<br/>\nI have a question regarding them. www.eqforge.com<br/>\nis a great resource for Rangers, Shaman, and Shadow<br/>\nKinghts. In particular, the Shaman&#39;s Crucible (under<br/>\neqforge.com) has the only good Alchemy section I know<br/>\nof.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m interested in hearing your thoughts. What sites<br/>\ndo you use for<br/>\nwhat?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
