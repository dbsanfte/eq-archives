I am<br/>\ntalking about when people ask ME for a port. They should<br/>\npay if they ask! If they tell me beforehand that they<br/>\ncan&#39;t pay, that&#39;s no problem.

It&#39;s a<br/>\nmatter of manners.&lt;br&gt;On a happier note, I held a raid<br/>\nin CT last night with my guild; we got a very nice<br/>\nturnout. But I made it to 35 while we were there!
