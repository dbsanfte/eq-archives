Everquest and other MMORPGs are fantasies <br/>\nthat we use to relieve stress and put the world away.   back in the <br/>\n70s we were playing Dungeons and Dragons for the same.<br/>\n   For some couping with the real world or people is too much and <br/>\nthey drive deeper into the fantasies we provide with our stories.   <br/>\nIS the problem with the GAME? no not really we are venting their <br/>\nissues and in some ways showing a differant path to mental health.<br/>\n<br/>\n   A few people every year suicide because of role playing.  Why? <br/>\nbecuece they put too much of them selves into their charactors.  FOr <br/>\nsome it was they brought their toons into the real world and died <br/>\nthinking they could have special powers if they really tried(guess <br/>\nthe pavement disagreed).   For others their toon was them( the real <br/>\nworld person locked them selves in their own minds and only <br/>\ninteracted as the toon.( most of these we lock up in time but some <br/>\nare missed)   IN everquest most people have at least 3 toons( think I <br/>\nhave 11 on 3 servers over 3 years)  this helps blur this line of who <br/>\nthey are in game and keeps them from getting fixated on one persona. <br/>\n<br/>\n    RPGers have Always been outside the main stream so more of us are <br/>\ncrazy or at least abnormal( as if we would wish to be normal).  <br/>\nSociety has always labeled us as devil worshipers or crazy.   We meet <br/>\nin small rooms in back of comic shops becuase churches us.    For <br/>\nevery suicide or killing( gamers were blamed for school shootings <br/>\nREGULARLY) we all are blamed by society.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on a last note back in the early 80s a book titled (What is <br/>\nDungeons and Dragons?) written by a pair of British gamers detailing <br/>\nthe history and world of RPGs for the main stream person is a great <br/>\naid for anyone writing about RPG MMORPG or gamers in general.   IT <br/>\nfinal shut my mother up on believing the bad press we always get.   <br/>\nTHis is not the first 60 minutes story  done attacking gameing and <br/>\nfar for the last( look at their type of viewers.. give the masses <br/>\nwhat they want... worked for the Romans) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTundrawyrm: EQtavern <br/>\nFrostpipes the bard, Mommaa: Everquest<br/>\nMink the voodoun preistess, Jed, Rasta, and Ivan: Chill<br/>\nCapt.

In<br/>\n&gt; the opening game sequence in agreeing to the contract,<br/>\n&gt; a person must be of lawful age or have the consent of<br/>\n&gt; a parent or legal guardian.  Unless of course, his<br/>\n&gt; father didn&#39;t know, then his son was pursuing illegal<br/>\n&gt; activities. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  And, about his solution.  Sending his son to boarding<br/>\n&gt; school.... LMAO  don&#39;t take the kid away from video<br/>\n&gt; games, take video games away from the kid.  I mean<br/>\n&gt; SERIOUSLY.  Any child that would not abide by the<br/>\n&gt; house rules isn&#39;t too well raised anyway.. he says he<br/>\n&gt; heard his son playing in the middle of the night... he<br/>\n&gt; shoulda picked his kid up by the collar and beat the<br/>\n&gt; ever lovin %^*$ out of him.... I gaurantee, he would<br/>\n&gt; reconsider breaking the rules if he knew there would<br/>\n&gt; be consiquences... obviously this kid had more<br/>\n&gt; problems thanm just video games...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Don&#39;t even get me started about the suicidal punk on<br/>\n&gt; 48 hours either......   I hate to sound cold and<br/>\n&gt; lacking in compassion, but quite frankly she asked for<br/>\n&gt; the view of the players, she undoubtedly SAW 48 hours<br/>\n&gt; in the first place, and it was most likely what<br/>\n&gt; provoked the choice of senior thesis.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Peace out,<br/>\n&gt;   Marshun PsyKo<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/sdetail1142.html?story=1142\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/sdetail1142.html?story=1142</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, anyone who would be so afflicted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the outcome of a game is not a terribly stable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the first place.  Everquest has actually helped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; save money for tuition, and has kept me out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trouble<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as well.  I sit at home and play EverQuest for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hours every night.  With a starting cost of 9.95<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the game, 12.95 a month for a pre-paid card (I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; credit cards), I get the first month free, 19.99 a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; month in internet services (which I would have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyway)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Everquest is a subliminal addiction, just like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; certain people setting <br/>\n&gt; &gt; all things aside for football... on a much lesser<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scale of course <br/>\n&gt; &gt; because quite frank, there is absolutely no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; redeeming value of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dedicating one&#39;s entire time and achieving something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in a video game <br/>\n&gt; &gt; besides personal satisfaction (unless it&#39;s some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; godawful tournament <br/>\n&gt; &gt; which I can&#39;t ****ing stand). It all depends on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; individual. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Certain people can set rigid guidelines for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; themselves (play for a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; certain number of hours) and abide by them, and some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people can&#39;t. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s another link:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.etonline.com/television/a12770.htm\">http://www.etonline.com/television/a12770.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Digital<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
