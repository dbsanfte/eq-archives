I started grouping there with my druid at<br/>\nlvl 22, and was welcome for heals, Damage shileds and<br/>\nSOW, as well as nukes (that got resisted a lot at that<br/>\nlevel though). For a low 20s char-- the loot isn&#39;t bad.<br/>\nYou can get the scrolls for the gem inlaid guants,<br/>\nget some FS weapons occasionally, get a dagger of<br/>\ndropping, and SP armor (doesn&#39;t sell that well anymore,<br/>\nexcept the gloves which still go for at least 15pp, at<br/>\nleast on Xev). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At upper 20s, you can find<br/>\nadventurers willing to go inside PAW, where grouping in the<br/>\n&quot;safe rooms&quot; are great xp, if not a bit boring. Don&#39;t<br/>\nforget &quot;KFC&quot; (which we lovingly refer to as the aviak<br/>\ntown in SK). The aviaks are of varying levels, meaning<br/>\nyou can solo or group fight them for many levels.<br/>\nThey drop some quest items, so there&#39;s always people<br/>\nready to group on them. SK is a great place to kite if<br/>\nyou&#39;re a druid, and I would kite aviaks around when<br/>\nsoloing for great xp. You can also charm an elephant to<br/>\nhelp you out-- I had great fun letting my elephant<br/>\npets beat down the little chickens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did do<br/>\nLake Rathe a few times, just at the gnoll/undead camp<br/>\non the other side of the SK zone, which was a great<br/>\ncamp, but not easy to get a group to go there (at least<br/>\nin my experience). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After 27-- you can go the<br/>\nboring route and head to FM and then to OT on Kunark. FM<br/>\nis acutally a good place to group at the giant<br/>\nfort-- some good loot can drop and giant killing is fun<br/>\nfor all. OLD WORLD spots for high 20s to 30s usually<br/>\nmeans dungeons. Cazic Thule is great, but not easy<br/>\naccess. Rathe Mtns is almost within reach, and you might<br/>\nbe able to get a group of giant hunters there once<br/>\nyou hit 30. SK gnolls is your best bet. Unrest is<br/>\nstill viable, but you have to go after some mean mobs.<br/>\nMistmore is viable, but only at the ent area at high<br/>\n20s/low 30s. Stonebrunt is good hunting, but it&#39;s way<br/>\nover there, so bring your own group. If you&#39;re on<br/>\nKunark, don&#39;t forget about Warslik&#39;s Woods-- Forest giant<br/>\ncamp, gobbies and iksar, and not crowded at all.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(continued)...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
