I can tell you I have never played this game, <br/>\n&gt; but I have a few friends that did, and some of the things they say <br/>\n&gt; they did was call out from work sick, and play the game seven hours <br/>\n&gt; in one setting! These are the things I am looking for and my friend <br/>\n&gt; suggested that if they did it, then there are countless others out <br/>\n&gt; there that have done even more. I am also looking into how you got <br/>\n&gt; hooked on playing this game. Did someone lend you a copy? Play it <br/>\n&gt; over a friend&#39;s house? Also, please note that I am not bashing <br/>\n&gt; anybody here - I am a video game addict myself. I admit I love to <br/>\n&gt; play them, and spent countless days playing Final Fantasy into the <br/>\n&gt; early hours of the morning. I hope you guys and girls can help me <br/>\n&gt; out. Thanks again!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL Oh the stories I could tell of when I DID play. (And yes I am <br/>\nattempting to get back into the game. I just need a few things to go <br/>\nright for once and then it is on to the crazy things I used to do!) <br/>\nLet&#39;s see...I did stay glued to my comp one night when I was in Maine <br/>\nfor I think it was close to 24 hours. I was trying to get a sub <br/>\ncharacter up to level 19 so I could teleport and join a group. (Ya he <br/>\nwas a druid who was soon scrapped) Um....I&#39;ve chosen to play EQ over <br/>\ngoing to the movies with my (now ex) boyfriend. I hope this will help <br/>\nyou at least a little.
