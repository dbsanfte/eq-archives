I love<br/>\ngrouping with Pallys. The tank well, great against undead,<br/>\nbut most importantly they have Lay on Hands (which<br/>\nhas saved my life more than once) AND can heal<br/>\nthemselves after battles (which lowers downtime and saves<br/>\nthe healer&#39;s mana). SKs are nice because they tank<br/>\nwell AND can summon a pet. (one of my chars is a mage,<br/>\nand I know full well the value of a good pet. The pet<br/>\ncan tank when you need a break, the pet can taunt so<br/>\nyou can run if needed, and that extra damage can mean<br/>\nthe difference in a tough battle). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I assume<br/>\nyou didn&#39;t mention Clerics because that&#39;s a<br/>\nno-brainer. They&#39;re great and welcome at any time.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT--if a cleric isn&#39;t available, a druid will serve as a<br/>\nhealer in a pinch. I&#39;ve been in groups as a druid where<br/>\ni am the primary healer. Then, the next day, i&#39;ll<br/>\nbe a nuker, or even one of the tanks. Druids are my<br/>\nfav class because you aren&#39;t typcast -- Clerics are<br/>\nhealers, Pallys are tanks, Shammys are buffer/debuffers,<br/>\nWizzies are Nukers, etc. . We are the best solo artists,<br/>\nand we are the jack of all trades in a group. In an<br/>\noutdoor group especially, we make the best pullers.<br/>\n(Track, find a great mob, snare and DOT it, and lead it<br/>\nby a chain back to your group)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone has<br/>\nsomething to say about the best classes at higher levels.<br/>\nEVERY class has benefits and burdens. What YOU like<br/>\nabout the game will probably determine which class you<br/>\nlike at a higher level. Unfortunately, many people I<br/>\nknow pick a race/class combo that sounds fun, gets<br/>\ncaught up in leveling that character up, then gets stuck<br/>\nin a HELL level and realizes that they really don&#39;t<br/>\nlike playing that char anymore. I LOVE the mage class.<br/>\nMany higher levels complain about the limitations and<br/>\nabilities of the mage at higher levels. I love the fact<br/>\nthat, at least in the mid 20s, I can solo AND group<br/>\nvery effectively. What will it be like at lvl 40? I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure. But i think i&#39;ll still be happy if &#39;ole<br/>\nJobabaner is by my side and I&#39;m slamming baddies with my<br/>\npotent nukes. Oh, yeah-- don&#39;t i also get the malaise<br/>\nline of spells too?? WOOT!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My mains are a mage<br/>\nand a druid. Neither are melee classes (although I<br/>\nsometimes will tank with my druid). I love the complexity<br/>\nof choosing what spell will be effective in what<br/>\nsituation, given my mana limitations. BUT-- I sometimes wish<br/>\ni could tank. Mayhap i&#39;ll creat a<br/>\nwarrior/monk/pally/sk soon??? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rambling on and on and on and on<br/>\nand on and on....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
