I know it&#39;s tough to<br/>\nadmit you&#39;re wrong, but just do it! Start your druid<br/>\nchar today and correct the errors of your past!! Want<br/>\na challenge?? Start a 1/2 elf druid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You<br/>\nknow, playing around with all those undead all the time<br/>\ncan give you a sour disposition too. I&#39;ve even seen<br/>\nit from the pallys--who are generally good people,<br/>\nif not a bit overzealous. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A little off<br/>\ntopic-- Necros are supposed to be really powerful, ok. I<br/>\nRARELY see any on my server (xev), and have only grouped<br/>\nwith necros on a handful of occassions. (I group about<br/>\n98% of the time-- i&#39;m a social druid who&#39;s NOT a<br/>\nkiting fanatic). Where are they all?? Are the out<br/>\nsoloing, defiling graves (haha Kroq), or hanging out with<br/>\nthe undead? I&#39;ve always wanted to know this-- do the<br/>\nghouls, skellys, etc /con amiably to necros?? that would<br/>\nbe funny! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tunare&#39;s children grow in her<br/>\nlight and bless Norrath, while those unworthy of her<br/>\nglory wither and die in the shadows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela<br/>\nOrcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 32d season&lt;br&gt;Defenders of Mithril<br/>\nHall&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
