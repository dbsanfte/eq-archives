Sorry but it was my first quest. :) Although im<br/>\n11 lvl (not much but getting there), I had the worse<br/>\narmor and the worse skill choice, etc. etc. Yesterday I<br/>\nread allot about the skills and the restrictions of<br/>\nbeing a monk and all of it. NOW I know what I was doing<br/>\nwrong... Yesterday too I did all the shackle stuff till<br/>\nthe stone one... Which is good... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On one of<br/>\nthe Guides, Documents, or Whatever I read Yesterday,<br/>\nthey say that the Fists will be allways better because<br/>\nof the weight restriction, that two good weapons<br/>\nwill allways weight a lot. Is this true?<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another thing, I didn&#39;t knew that I had Dodge, so i<br/>\ndidn&#39;t invested anything on it, so it seems that i&#39;m not<br/>\nusing it, but I already spent all my skill points<br/>\n(obviously on the incorrect places :) ) Is there a way of<br/>\ntraining the Dodge thing without skill points, or i have<br/>\nto lvl...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
