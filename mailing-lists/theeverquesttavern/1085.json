Would you be willing to pay<br/>\n$49.95/month for &quot;Premium Customer Service&quot; and a &quot;population<br/>\nCap&quot; on your server?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What a F-ing joke! If<br/>\nanyone pressed the yes button when asked this...they<br/>\nneed to get examined by a shrink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the<br/>\nshitty ass customer service present at Verant today (I<br/>\nknow firsthand, it is terrible), how does Verant hope<br/>\nto convince me that they even know what &quot;Premium<br/>\nCustomer Service&quot; means???!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To them &quot;Premium&quot; is<br/>\nmost likely what other &quot;Reputable&quot; companies would<br/>\nconsider &quot;Bare Minimum Service&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$49.95 a<br/>\nmonth??!!! What a bunch of greedy ass bastards (excuse my<br/>\nFrench). Let&#39;s look at some numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are<br/>\ncurrently over 100,000 ACTIVE SUBSCRIBERS at Verant. This<br/>\nnumber is VERY conservative, im sure the actual figure<br/>\nis much higher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will work with 100,000 for<br/>\nease of use.&lt;br&gt;Each of these people pay an average of<br/>\n$8.95/month to play everquest. That comes to $895,000 PER<br/>\nMONTH...every single month!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That comes to $10,740,000<br/>\nper YEAR!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the greedy asses want to kick<br/>\nit to $49.95/month on a voluntary basis. Let us<br/>\nagain seek to predict the future and say that a mere<br/>\n10% of active subscribers fall for this pathetic<br/>\nploy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That would mean 10,000 (conservatively) people would<br/>\nagree to pay the $49.95/month which comes to $410,000<br/>\nMORE COMING IN EACH MONTH. Note: I deducted the<br/>\n$89,500 these 10,000 are already paying from the original<br/>\nfigure of $499,500.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This would mean Verant would<br/>\nbring in an additional $4,920,000/ per year....for<br/>\ndoing absolutely NOTHING that they should not already<br/>\nbe doing!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rally together people.....Do not<br/>\nEVER agree to do this, when it is offered in the<br/>\nfuture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think about it, it makes NO sense. IF you agree with me<br/>\non this issue...can I get a HELL<br/>\nYEAH?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MrHappy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
