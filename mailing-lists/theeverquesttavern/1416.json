Just go to Lake of Ill<br/>\nOmens and then shout out level 13 sk lfg (looking for<br/>\ngroup). You shouldn&#39;t have much problem finding a<br/>\ngroup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunting is good in Lake as spawn rates seem swift and<br/>\nfast. Haven&#39;t personally killed there much as I went<br/>\nthe Derv camp, Orcs in Oasis, and Aviaks route. Had<br/>\nbeen doing Tech Mas Gnolls but friends told me to go<br/>\nto Lake. Lake doesn&#39;t seem to have much loot but<br/>\ndang the exp is goooood and the stream of kills rarely<br/>\npauses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope that helped.&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
