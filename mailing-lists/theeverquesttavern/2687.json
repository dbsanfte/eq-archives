My lvl 10 (now) Ench was playing in Black Burrow in the <br/>\n&gt; wee hours this morning and I kept getting Ruined Gnoll Leather <br/>\nstuff <br/>\n&gt; (like gloves, wristbands etc...) Someone said that this is for a <br/>\n&gt; Druid, Ranger quest? If this is does anyone know how it works? I <br/>\nask <br/>\n&gt; czause I have a druid and I&#39;d like to get her some decent stuff <br/>\n&gt; maybe. Anyway, thanks for the info if you have it.
