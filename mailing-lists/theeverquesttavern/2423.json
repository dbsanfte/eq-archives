My question is<br/>\nthen, who are shammys able to stack potions??? Aren&#39;t<br/>\nthey items with charges???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for poison<br/>\ncomponents-- they are much more difficult and spread out than<br/>\nspell research components. I have played a mage and a<br/>\nchanter, and have known that I could spend some time in a<br/>\ncertain place (unrest, Oasis, etc) to get a good amount<br/>\nof the words/pages i need for various level spells.<br/>\nAnd I was always able to group in rather populated<br/>\nzones to get the items. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rogues, on the other<br/>\nhand, need to go to some out of the way places to get<br/>\nsome of the components. (Not many people hanging out<br/>\nin lavastorm killing imps, drakes and basalisks).<br/>\nThe only consolation is that some components can be<br/>\nbought, BUT the different vendors are quite spread out--<br/>\nthe most important one being in the middle of nowhere<br/>\nin WK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had a 23 rogue who was pretty good a<br/>\npoison making, but turned away from the server he was on<br/>\nto be with friends. I&#39;ve since started over with a<br/>\nrogue (one of my favorite classes), and am on my way to<br/>\npoison level. Can&#39;t wait to start mass producing blind,<br/>\nsnare, root, DD, DOT and other<br/>\npoisons!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rumbl&lt;br&gt;18th level rogue&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
