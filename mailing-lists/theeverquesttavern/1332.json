Monks, by nature, are not a worldly<br/>\nclass. Therefore, they do not wear much armor or carry<br/>\nanything with them deemed unnecessary. Monks lose a<br/>\ndefensive bonus if their weight ever exceeds 14, so pack<br/>\nlight. All good monk armor weighs next to nothing. A<br/>\ngood idea would be to get woven or netted armor from<br/>\nFrogloks, or at least the gloves. Magic gloves count as<br/>\nmagic weapons with hand-to-hand. While monkeys can use<br/>\nblunt weapons, a true monk finds his strength in his<br/>\nown body. Monks are also the masters of feigning<br/>\ndeath, which can save the whole group. For listing<br/>\npurposes, here are the benefits of a monk:&lt;br&gt;Damage, lots<br/>\nof it, and fast as a naked barbarian in<br/>\nEverfrost&lt;br&gt;Really excellent looking abilities like the roundhouse<br/>\nkick.&lt;br&gt;Feign death, you will find a place in groups very<br/>\neasily with this skill&lt;br&gt;Mend wounds-monk only, full<br/>\nheal (at least I think it&#39;s full heal)&lt;br&gt;Safe fall-<br/>\nagain excellent for pullers&lt;br&gt;Never have to worry<br/>\nabout money, there are very few things you will ever<br/>\nreally need after cured silk or better armor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now<br/>\nfor the downfalls:&lt;br&gt;Remember that last statement?<br/>\nYou&#39;ll really never have the money for anything. Monks<br/>\nare probably the poorest class on average. Take your<br/>\nloot in plat or gems only. You have to watch for that<br/>\nover 14 stoneweight penalty.&lt;br&gt;No armor means more<br/>\ndamage taken, if you don&#39;t dodge that is&lt;br&gt;Until you<br/>\nget feign death, there is not a terrible lot of call<br/>\nfor monks&lt;br&gt;There are very few monks in the world of<br/>\nNorrath, means that you will have to find information from<br/>\noutside sources (everlore, allakazam (sp?), etc..) unlike<br/>\ndruids, where there is one always around the<br/>\ncorner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember that monks are not tanks, they have no taunt<br/>\nskill and cannot take the damage like a tanker.<br/>\nPersonally I have found my monk to be one of my most<br/>\nenjoyable characters to play, simply because I don&#39;t have<br/>\nto worry about earning enough cash to by that magic<br/>\nweapon or expensive armor. All I need is a good pair of<br/>\ngloves and some bandages. (I know some will disagree<br/>\nwith my anti-weapon for monks stance, but then I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave anything wrong with a bo stick or other such<br/>\nthings. I just like the Jackie Chan style action. When<br/>\nyou rip a gnoll commander&#39;s head off with your fist,<br/>\nit just feels better than with a big<br/>\nstick.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Druid of Karana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roen&lt;br&gt;Monk<br/>\nof Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
