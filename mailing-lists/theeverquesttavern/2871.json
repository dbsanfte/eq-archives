Everquest has actually helped me<br/>\nsave money for tuition, and has kept me out of trouble<br/>\nas well.  I sit at home and play EverQuest for a few<br/>\nhours every night.  With a starting cost of 9.95 for<br/>\nthe game, 12.95 a month for a pre-paid card (I hate<br/>\ncredit cards), I get the first month free, 19.99 a<br/>\nmonth in internet services (which I would have anyway)<br/>\n<br/>\nLets figure roughly how much I spend in a 4 month<br/>\nperiod  79.96 internet  9.95 for the game and 38.85<br/>\nfor the card.  128.74  total spending on the game in a<br/>\n4 month period.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   And, a little comparison.  7.50 movie ticket 5.00<br/>\nsmall popcorn (highway robbery [the cost of movie<br/>\npopcorn should be regulated =P ]) 12.50 x 5 nights a<br/>\nweek 62.50 a week.  Or for the more conservative (such<br/>\nas myself) 5.95 for a new paperback book (I go through<br/>\nabout 4 of these a week when im not playing online). <br/>\n5.95 x 4 23.80 per week.  The only way I could see<br/>\novercoming the savings seen here is to go to the<br/>\nlibrary.  The one in my town kinda sux so I don&#39;t very<br/>\noften.<br/>\n<br/>\n   On the other hand, It cuts you off from anything<br/>\nsocial or deemed <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nY!
