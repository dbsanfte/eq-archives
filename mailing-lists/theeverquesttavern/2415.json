But<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty much the opposite of you; I started a Good<br/>\n(Human) Cleric. I suspect we&#39;d have to try to hurt each<br/>\nother if we met in-game (although I&#39;d certainly offer a<br/>\ntruce to anyone from this club!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, yes, it<br/>\nis much different. I haven&#39;t gotten to the<br/>\nPvP-capable level yet, but that doesn&#39;t stop people from<br/>\ntrying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as I&#39;ve heard, for melees in PvP it&#39;s all<br/>\nabout getting Magic Resistance equipment. If you can<br/>\nwithstand a spell, you have a much better chance of getting<br/>\nin close. Range weapons will help, if you can time<br/>\nit to interrupt casting, too. But the big drawback<br/>\nis that you don&#39;t have any form of Snare or Root,<br/>\nwhich is what most PvP&#39;s start off with,<br/>\nevidently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I applaud you for trying something hard. I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen told that Clerics are kind of useless for PvP,<br/>\nsince they have very little in the way of non-magical<br/>\noffensive skills (see the MR note above). Their biggest<br/>\nadvantage is that they&#39;re hard to kill, because of their<br/>\nhealing abilities. Many times, folks just give up, as the<br/>\nCleric stands there and heals himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I intend<br/>\nto be a necromancer-hunter. I figure that my<br/>\nanti-undead spells would be good for that. We&#39;ll<br/>\nsee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leofric, Kharlisht&#39;s alter-ego on Sullon Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
