Sure you may get a pretty lost<br/>\nat first, but you will find your way around<br/>\neventually and it is always a good idea to have as maybe<br/>\nplaces known to you. As for stats theres lots of stat<br/>\nbuffing stuff out there, as well as lots of buffing<br/>\nspells. Faction however is something I would take in<br/>\nconsideration, depending however if you like being the &quot;outlaw<br/>\ntype&quot; hehe. I think the most important thing you should<br/>\nlook for is unique chararistics in a player. A warrior<br/>\nwho can safe fall(Vah Shir), or warrior who can<br/>\nhide/forage for food(wood elf), which could come in handy I&#39;m<br/>\nsure, ah HG!!! /hide... =) A shammy, necro who has the<br/>\nability to regen as well as xtra Ac(Iksar) Unfortunatly I<br/>\ndon&#39;t speak from experiance, these are just ideas of<br/>\nmine. I myself started with the typical Barb shammy<br/>\ngood character I think, but I wish I would have chosen<br/>\nsomething a little &quot;different&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just my opionon....<br/>\n=)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
