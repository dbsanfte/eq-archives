I do not know how much actual<br/>\nphysical help I could give you. Maybe a few plat or<br/>\nsomething to get rolling. That&#39;s only if you play on my<br/>\nserver though (Brell).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for your comment on<br/>\npeople killing you, nobody can actually attack you<br/>\nunless you play on one of the PvP servers, Rallos,<br/>\nVallon, or Tallon Zek. If you do decide to play on Rallos<br/>\nZek, let me know because I have an old level 12 guy<br/>\nthere that I do not use any more. You could have all<br/>\nhis stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since you have never played EQ<br/>\nbefore, I would NOT suggest starting on one of the PvP<br/>\nservers. They can be somewhat frustrating for<br/>\nbeginners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall I think you will enjoy the game. I know I have<br/>\nplayed it non-stop for the last year :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever<br/>\nyour decisions may be, best of luck and good<br/>\nhunting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
