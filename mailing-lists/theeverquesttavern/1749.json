High-levels watch you fight for your life<br/>\nin the newbie zones, and will frequently give you<br/>\nbetter gear than you have, and certainly help/heal if<br/>\nyou ask for it or need it. This is what hooked me on<br/>\nthe game -- folks who go out of their way to help you<br/>\nfind a corpse, or teach you about the game while<br/>\nplaying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, do you like to group or play solo? EQ is really<br/>\nmade for grouping, although you can solo at the lower<br/>\nlevels a bit. Sounds like you and the main man have a<br/>\nready-made group; you should browse the threads at the<br/>\nofficial Everquest site to see discussions of what makes a<br/>\ngood two-person group, and plan accordingly. I once<br/>\nran across a team in their 50s that was fun to watch<br/>\n-- a cleric (High Elf) and warrior (Ogre). Weird<br/>\ncombo, but it worked for them (even if they did refuse<br/>\nto kill an Ogre NPC I wanted to loot; the big guy<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to spoil his faction at home).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh,<br/>\nyeah, that&#39;s another interesting thing about the game<br/>\n-- faction. Basically, it&#39;s your standing with the<br/>\nvarious NPC races and organizations. Want to play an<br/>\nOgre, but circulate among the Humans? Go kill a few<br/>\nthousand orcs, and eventually NPCs in certain towns will<br/>\nsell and talk to you, grudgingly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are<br/>\nsome sites to browse for tips:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.<br/>\nwww.EQAtlas.com -- a must. Good intro and map to almost every<br/>\nzone in the game, links to discussions, bestiaries,<br/>\nquests. I like to go into a zone blind the first time,<br/>\nand then go get a map for further<br/>\nexploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. everquest.allakhazam.com -- another must,<br/>\nalthough some of the info can be dated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.<br/>\nwww.Everlore.com -- your third place to be. Much player-supplied<br/>\ninfo, so some of it should be taken with a grain of<br/>\nsalt. Don&#39;t know what the Skeleton Fist you looted is<br/>\nfor? Neither does anybody else on the site, but when<br/>\nthey do, they&#39;ll post it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.<br/>\nwww.everquest.com -- official site; the Newbie Zone discussion<br/>\nboard is OK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Various class-specific sites:<br/>\nEQCleric.com (obvious); www.thesafehouse.org (indispensable<br/>\nfor my kind, Rogues). You might also try<br/>\n&lt;a href=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/.\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/.</a> target=new&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/.&lt;/a\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/.&lt;/a</a>&gt; I found the guides at GameSpot<br/>\n(&lt;a href=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/features/everquest_gg/index.html\">http://www.gamespot.com/features/everquest_gg/index.html</a> target=new&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/features/everquest_gg/index.html&lt;/a\">http://www.gamespot.com/features/everquest_gg/index.html&lt;/a</a>&gt;) very useful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, there you go, for now.<br/>\nJust remember that your first few weeks will be the<br/>\nbest -- you don&#39;t know what anything does or how hard<br/>\nit is to kill. Everything is new . . . And then<br/>\nyou&#39;ll get some levels, and find a new place to<br/>\nadventure, and it&#39;s just like being a newbie again, except<br/>\nthat now you kinda know what you&#39;re doing with all the<br/>\nbuttons and stuff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck. Look me up on<br/>\nDrinal or the new roleplaying server if you ever get a<br/>\nCD key . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;Rogue<br/>\nof the 21st season&lt;br&gt;Drinal&lt;br&gt;Specializing in<br/>\nbackstabbing, corpse recovery, and Butcherblock Mountains guide<br/>\nservice</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
