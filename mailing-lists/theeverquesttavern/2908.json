Even tho my idea for an<br/>\nall mage guild didn&#39;t work.. I have a new idea =) <br/>\nBazaar is going to be REOPENED in Freeport... how is<br/>\nthis possible you ask?  Well, if we all take our<br/>\nbusiness to FP, then we can open up a mini-bazaar of<br/>\ncourse for the time being, we won&#39;t have the niceities<br/>\nof AFk and such, but, with enough people there we can<br/>\nsell on the auction channel and just tell people we<br/>\nare in FP... the upside to FP is that ANYONE can go<br/>\nthere. (short of certian evil people which may often<br/>\nuse disguises to get in or just up faction)  The idea,<br/>\nis lead by example.. Start selling your goods in FP<br/>\nand others will come and do the same... if we start<br/>\ndoing this on ALL the servers, verant might take and<br/>\ndo something about it.. who knows, we might even have<br/>\nafk merchant abilities after a few months.... tell<br/>\nyour friends ... tell your clients... tell the people<br/>\nwho HATE luclin altogether, the bazaar is opening in<br/>\nFREEPORT and we SHALL succeed !!!! <br/>\n<br/>\n  talk to yall later,<br/>\n    Marshun PsyKo, <br/>\n AKA Willim Lupin Tribunal server 20th season<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
