The older<br/>\nservers have more people giving stuff away. I hate to say<br/>\nit... but the High End game on Drinal is<br/>\nridiculous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I started November of 2000 and I still don&#39;t have a<br/>\nhigh end character-- so I can&#39;t be 100%<br/>\nsure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I&#39;ve been told that about 40% of Drinal is 50+ or<br/>\nhas a character 50+. From what I can tell from the<br/>\nconsensus of people-- that&#39;s probably close to<br/>\ntruth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So maybe that&#39;s why this server gives women more<br/>\nitems. LOL. Don&#39;t feel too bad. Course also you might be<br/>\nplaying a Troll, Iskar or Ogre female. It&#39;s kinda hard<br/>\nsometimes to tell that they&#39;re female when people are<br/>\ngiving things away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>\nPrismatic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... this is not to say that I know the mentality for<br/>\ncertain of those that give away items to women that ask<br/>\nfor them or just stand there looking lost.<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I give away stuff to all just being myself. heh.<br/>\n(when I do of course)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shoomie out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
