If it s to get through","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-376166652\">I&#39;ve never really liked twinks, but never though<br/>\nto ask &quot;why?&quot; After thinking about it, they don&#39;t<br/>\nmake me as mad as before. Why twink? If it&#39;s to get<br/>\nthrough the &quot;low&quot; levels and get to the high levels<br/>\nquicker, then go for it. I won&#39;t, because I like to enjoy<br/>\neach level. And if you twink and go, I probably won&#39;t<br/>\nhave to experience you for very long anyway. If it&#39;s<br/>\nto run around Crushbone and shout, lvl 8 druid with<br/>\n200WIS LFG, then just stay home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To me, MAJOR<br/>\ntwinking is like cheating. It&#39;s like cheat codes in some<br/>\ngames, or reading the back of the book. Getting<br/>\nsomething that someone else doesn&#39;t have to make you better<br/>\nthan the rest. If you don&#39;t have the patience or<br/>\nability to do it yourself, the regular way, then I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave time for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT-- here are a few things<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind: If you twink to get to lvl 20 because<br/>\nall your friends are higher level and you want to<br/>\ngroup with them--what&#39;s the harm? You hurt yourself<br/>\nbecause you don&#39;t enjoy the lower levels and you probably<br/>\ndon&#39;t have enough experience to be a great player if<br/>\nyou rushed through the levels. Also, minor twinks are<br/>\njust part of EQ society-- get a piece of<br/>\narmor/weapon/item for being a good person, no harm in that. At lvl<br/>\n10, I was given a velium mace from a guy who had gone<br/>\nto Velius for the first time-- not a great weapon,<br/>\nthough better than what i had. It was cool. I was still<br/>\nin mostly leather armore (with some tattered still,<br/>\ni think). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an aside-- my guild does not<br/>\nTwink our members. We will offer high end items at<br/>\ndiscound rates, but will not equip lower level members<br/>\nwith all the best stuff-- and our members like it that<br/>\nway. I remember getting an item that cost about 800pp<br/>\nfrom a guildmate-- i had only about 500pp in the bank<br/>\ntotal, and i handed over every last pp in the bank for<br/>\nthe item. Took me awhile to recover from that, but I<br/>\nhad the item and had paid a price for it. Twinking?<br/>\nmaybe-- harmful? I don&#39;t think so. I could have farmed<br/>\nMammoth tusks for a week to get the actualy money, but<br/>\ninstead I was out helping guildmembers and others, and<br/>\nleaving the mammys for others (who can get good xp for<br/>\nthem) to hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/rambling off&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
