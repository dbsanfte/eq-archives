Have you<br/>\nthought of checking out which servers might have more<br/>\npeople on during the times you play?? If I&#39;m in PST and<br/>\nplay normally from 2-5 am, a server that&#39;s mostly<br/>\nAmerican (PST-EST) may not be as good for me as one that&#39;s<br/>\nmainly European--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. You should be able to get<br/>\nback up to decent armor/items/weapon fairly easily.<br/>\nNon-twinked, my druid char didn&#39;t have THAT great stuff at lvl<br/>\n14-- in fact, most of my cash went to spells, and at<br/>\nleast you don&#39;t loose THOSE when you die. If you like<br/>\nthe char, it&#39;s hard to give it up. I&#39;m not sure how<br/>\ngood Shammys are at soloing as you go up in levels.<br/>\nNever had one, and don&#39;t see too many on my server, in<br/>\nfact out of 80 chars in my guild, there are only 3<br/>\nshammys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. As for great solo artists-- I&#39;ve heard<br/>\nthat NO warriors solo well after a certain level. My<br/>\nexperience for solo-ing is as follows: Necros are great,<br/>\nespecially in undead areas, Druids are increadible, BUT not<br/>\nuntil you become a kite and port master, high teens--<br/>\nyou can port to good hunting locations instead of<br/>\nrunning/boating. My mage is a surprisingly good soloist-- pets are<br/>\nvery handy once you learn to master using them in<br/>\nconjuction with spells. Pallys are ok soloists, though only<br/>\nin undead situations. The best soloist i know is a<br/>\nTroll SK-- he seems to STILL be able to solo evens and<br/>\nsome yellows (with HT) at lvl 33. High melee stats,<br/>\nnatural regen, spells and pet. Evil race?? makes it more<br/>\nfun to roleplay. Only real problem my friend has is<br/>\nthat he can&#39;t bank in most places-- BUT-- there are<br/>\nstill a few unique merchants he can sell to-- he can<br/>\nbank in Runnyeye, and his STR is soooo high that he<br/>\ncan carry TONS of plat around for a long time. He was<br/>\ndiscouraged at first, but found how many places in<br/>\nS.Antonicus (close to his home) he could hunt, and then he<br/>\nheaded out to OT where all evil races are welcome and no<br/>\ngood guards are around at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just some<br/>\nthoughts-- good luck!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
