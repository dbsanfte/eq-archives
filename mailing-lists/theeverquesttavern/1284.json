It is called<br/>\neverQUEST ya know. :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But honestly things are<br/>\npretty tough and can be boring until you get into your<br/>\nmid to late 20s. At least it was for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m a<br/>\nranger 30th level on bristlebane and most of the quests<br/>\nthat can be done as a ranger can&#39;t even be started<br/>\nuntil just now. :-) As a matter of fact I just<br/>\ncompleted my first quest for the short sword of morin and<br/>\neven then I had help from fellow guildmembers to<br/>\ndo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find it hard to do quests legit because you need<br/>\na group and most groups force you to roll for quest<br/>\nitems so if I get a group together to quest for<br/>\nsomething I need I still may not end up with it even if we<br/>\ncomplete it! Its a bummer sometimes! :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish<br/>\nthey would do more single character<br/>\nquests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dinbien&lt;br&gt;30th Ranger&lt;br&gt;Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
