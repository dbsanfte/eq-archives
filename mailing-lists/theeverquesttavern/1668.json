In the half dozen or so times I have teleported<br/>\nthere I have yet to even see an enemy, plus there are<br/>\nnormally people standing around that keep the area clear<br/>\nof wandering beasts. On the other hand, when you<br/>\nteleport to Cazic there is a good chance you will be<br/>\nattacked upon arrival, and I am told the same holds true<br/>\nfor Iceclad. I have teleported 3 times to Iceclad and<br/>\none time saw an enemy, so I don&#39;t know really how<br/>\nsafe it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as fees go, I teleport for<br/>\ndonations and have received as little as nothing for corpse<br/>\nretrivals up to 100pp, so I feel donations work really<br/>\nwell. I probably average about 25pp per<br/>\nshot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safe Journeys my friends and look me up if you are on<br/>\nthe Xegony server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizzkid, 36th year&lt;br&gt;Grim<br/>\nRealm Warriors Guild</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
