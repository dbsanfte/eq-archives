Anyway,<br/>\nduring the fight, I was somehow knocked over the edge<br/>\nand fell to my untimely demise. When I returned, I<br/>\nwas unable to locate my corpse. I found a friendly<br/>\nBard to help me locate, but still no good. I<br/>\npetitioned for help and got no response (suprise, suprise).<br/>\nWell to make a long story short I am now a naked lvl<br/>\n14 Barbarian Shaman with 30pp in the bank and a<br/>\nchoice to make.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My question is should I continue<br/>\nwith the Shaman or maybe start anew with a different<br/>\nclass that might be easier to solo?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
