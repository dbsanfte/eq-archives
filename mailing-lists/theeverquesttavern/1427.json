It sounds like you are either having<br/>\ntrouble with Habbib in the Paineel newbie zone, or you<br/>\nare going too far into the Warrens. Habbib is a pain,<br/>\nbut you can outrun him most of the time, especially<br/>\nif you have SoW. When I visit the warrens with my<br/>\ndruid, I usually kill Habbib and let his corpse lie<br/>\nthere to help out any non-heretic newbies trying to get<br/>\nto the warrens. Note: the warrens is a lvl 6 or<br/>\nabove dungeon. I would advise waiting until about 7 or<br/>\n8 so that you have no trouble with any of the<br/>\nskeletons guarding the paineel zone. Other than that,<br/>\nrun!&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Cheif Druid Executive of Spiritus<br/>\nValorum&lt;br&gt;Tunare&#39;s Chosen of Karana&lt;br&gt;Master Brewer&lt;br&gt;Master<br/>\nDrinker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
