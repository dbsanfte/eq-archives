It&#39;s nice that you thought<br/>\nabout helping newbies with your mage, but they will do<br/>\njust fine without the extra help. I have a 43rd level<br/>\nHuman Ranger (Grof Silversky) that I built from the<br/>\nbeginning with no t&#39;wicks, I hope someday to get<br/>\npowerful enough to go after dragons, time will tell.<br/>\nGood luck on your journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- PsyKo &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sibilant_ghost@...\">sibilant_ghost@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok,  I am trying to decide which character to get<br/>\n&gt; settled into.  I have a lvl 8 Monk with 209 NATURAL<br/>\n&gt; AC<br/>\n&gt; and a h2h attack of 152.  I also have a Mage I am<br/>\n&gt; working on it is also lvl 8.  With the mage, I can<br/>\n&gt; help people in the future, by supplying newbies with<br/>\n&gt; phantom plate armor, but with the monk, I have<br/>\n&gt; carefully raised him with very high skill points,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; am able to take on lvl 10-12 equiv mobs.  The<br/>\n&gt; thought<br/>\n&gt; of taking on dragons is very appealing.  <br/>\n&gt;   Any help in deciding which one to go further with<br/>\n&gt; would be much appreciated.
