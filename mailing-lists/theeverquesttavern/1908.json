As an Iksar I think you only have one<br/>\nchioce as far as a diety. The only drawback is that you<br/>\nare hated everywhere so banking could be a problem if<br/>\nyou decide to leave your island but it is not<br/>\nimpossible with a lot of faction work. Iksars also have a<br/>\nhigher natural regeneration rate which will save you a<br/>\nlot of downtime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I say choose a class that<br/>\nfits your playing style and personality. If you think<br/>\nyou are going to solo a lot I would recommend Necro,<br/>\nSK (if you want to melee), Druid or Mage. They seem<br/>\nto me to be the easiest solo classes. As far as race<br/>\ngoes, it is really a matter of preference. Race might<br/>\nmake a difference initially, but at high levels its<br/>\nalmost a non-issue. Chances are if you are like most of<br/>\nus, you will try many combinations of races/classes<br/>\nbefore you commit to one or two. Be warned, most of the<br/>\npeople around here seem to be Druids so expect to hear a<br/>\nlot about how great Druids are.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
