Everquest and other MMORPGs are fantasies <br/>\n  that we use to relieve stress and put the world away.   back in the <br/>\n  70s we were playing Dungeons and Dragons for the same.<br/>\n     For some couping with the real world or people is too much and <br/>\n  they drive deeper into the fantasies we provide with our stories.   <br/>\n  IS the problem with the GAME? no not really we are venting their <br/>\n  issues and in some ways showing a differant path to mental health.<br/>\n<br/>\n     A few people every year suicide because of role playing.  Why? <br/>\n  becuece they put too much of them selves into their charactors.  FOr <br/>\n  some it was they brought their toons into the real world and died <br/>\n  thinking they could have special powers if they really tried(guess <br/>\n  the pavement disagreed).   For others their toon was them( the real <br/>\n  world person locked them selves in their own minds and only <br/>\n  interacted as the toon.( most of these we lock up in time but some <br/>\n  are missed)   IN everquest most people have at least 3 toons( think I <br/>\n  have 11 on 3 servers over 3 years)  this helps blur this line of who <br/>\n  they are in game and keeps them from getting fixated on one persona. <br/>\n<br/>\n      RPGers have Always been outside the main stream so more of us are <br/>\n  crazy or at least abnormal( as if we would wish to be normal).  <br/>\n  Society has always labeled us as devil worshipers or crazy.

For <br/>\n  every suicide or killing( gamers were blamed for school shootings <br/>\n  REGULARLY) we all are blamed by society.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And on a last note back in the early 80s a book titled (What is <br/>\n  Dungeons and Dragons?) written by a pair of British gamers detailing <br/>\n  the history and world of RPGs for the main stream person is a great <br/>\n  aid for anyone writing about RPG MMORPG or gamers in general.

Any child that would not abide by the<br/>\n  &gt; house rules isn&#39;t too well raised anyway.. he says he<br/>\n  &gt; heard his son playing in the middle of the night... he<br/>\n  &gt; shoulda picked his kid up by the collar and beat the<br/>\n  &gt; ever lovin %^*$ out of him.... I gaurantee, he would<br/>\n  &gt; reconsider breaking the rules if he knew there would<br/>\n  &gt; be consiquences... obviously this kid had more<br/>\n  &gt; problems thanm just video games...<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   Don&#39;t even get me started about the suicidal punk on<br/>\n  &gt; 48 hours either......
