LOL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A second note: I just started an<br/>\nErudite Enchanter (now level 3, goes by the name<br/>\nArrelna), who will potentially be a jewelry making machine<br/>\nfor my characters and anyone else who needs stuff (at<br/>\na nominal fee, or less for friends.) Anyone have<br/>\nany ideas on powerleveling her and getting her some<br/>\nquick cash so she can start buying those gems and<br/>\nsilver bars? As far as I can tell, I&#39;ve got until level<br/>\n8 to get my enchant spell for the metal, and only<br/>\nfive more practice points needed to get her jewelcraft<br/>\nskill to 21, so I&#39;ll have some time to work on other<br/>\nthings before she starts making stuff. Let me know what<br/>\nyou all think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taniz (12 Ranger on Mithaniel<br/>\nMarr)&lt;br&gt;a.k.a. (Arrelna 3 Enchanter)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
