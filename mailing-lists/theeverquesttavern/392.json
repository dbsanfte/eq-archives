Humans have no night<br/>\nvision so you will need a lightsource (At 22 they gain a<br/>\nspell tht gives nightvision. Humans are not the most<br/>\nimposing, but they do have more choices on where to travel<br/>\nbecause they are not as hated as the &quot;evil&quot; races (Troll,<br/>\nogre, Dark Elf) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dark Elf-A classic race choice<br/>\nfor a shadowknight is an evil race, such as the Dark<br/>\nElves. Dark Elves are weak, so the heavy armor of a<br/>\nshadowknight might bog them down, but quick and good at<br/>\nhitting and not being hit. Also, they have a very high<br/>\nintelligence if you want your shadowknight to be especially<br/>\nproficient in spellcasting. Dark Elves have ultravision, the<br/>\nbest vision in the game, but are going to be hated by<br/>\nEVERYONE except ogres, trolls, and ofcourse Dark<br/>\nElves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Troll-Good at smashing things, basically. Very low<br/>\nintelligence, but extremely powerful in combat. They have<br/>\nplenty of strength to carry the heaviest equipment and<br/>\nstamina to stick it through a fight. They get good night<br/>\nvision, a stunning attack, and most importantly,<br/>\nregeneration. Regeneration allows a troll to regain hitpoints<br/>\nTWICE as fast as other races. However, trolls will be<br/>\nhated by everyone so don&#39;t plan on visiting many cities<br/>\nany time soon. Basically, trolls are strong, tough,<br/>\nand horrendously stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ogres-Pretty much the<br/>\nsame as a troll. Some minor differences are they get<br/>\nbetter night vision, better all around stats, but not<br/>\nregeneration. They are hated like trolls, tough like trolls,<br/>\nstrong like trolls, and only the slightest bit smarter<br/>\nthan trolls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So here are your choices.<br/>\nBasically, what it all comes down to is choose the type of<br/>\ncharacter you want to roleplay. Do you want and mysterious<br/>\nand intelligent shadowknight who is quick and agile,<br/>\nbringing terror on their foes? Dark Elf. Or, do you want a<br/>\nhulking brute with no knowledge of subtlety and<br/>\npreffering straight combat over their still useful spells?<br/>\nTroll or Ogre. Just choose what you think would be mroe<br/>\nfun, and then don&#39;t worry about stats. All characters<br/>\neven out stat-wise in one way or another, so don&#39;t<br/>\nworry about it =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
