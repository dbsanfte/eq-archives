Carry<br/>\nweight heavily penalizes you. I abandoned my monk for<br/>\nlater play when I can afford to say... &quot;No loot for me<br/>\nplz&quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskar monk at level 7 and I was carrying<br/>\nall the stuff I could b/c I&#39;m a poor boy.<br/>\nHeh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway... you&#39;re right. It&#39;s a hard class to play to me b/c<br/>\nof the money issues. But you hit often with a monk<br/>\nand can mend (which has caused myself to die before<br/>\nthough... OUCH-- crit fails on mend STINK!).<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway... every class has its ups and downs. I like<br/>\nwarriors vs Monks b/c Warriors can take hits... but monks<br/>\nare nice damage. And they&#39;ve got a really nice AC<br/>\nbonus for being under 14 stone. (not that I used that<br/>\nreally. Sigh... darned I&#39;m a poor character.<br/>\nLOL)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out... aka FatedHue Druid of Drinal in his 22nd<br/>\nRank.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
