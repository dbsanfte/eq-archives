It allows me to be shown on my guild&#39;s<br/>\nwhois and still not be found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was constantly<br/>\nget harrassed for SoWs and gates. I put myself on<br/>\nanonymous or role play and for a while-- unfortunately, ppl<br/>\nknew I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;no&quot; usually to a quick sow-- or<br/>\nif not in a group-- to gate. So I go roleplay. For<br/>\nthe most part-- it works out well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how you avoid it. I get hit up pretty hard<br/>\nusually for sows. Gates not as much so I don&#39;t mind as<br/>\nmuch-- although I went to anony once I got gates b/c I<br/>\nalready couldn&#39;t stand all the buffs I had to<br/>\ndo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue of Drinal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS...
