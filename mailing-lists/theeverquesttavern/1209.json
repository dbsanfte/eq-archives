I didn&#39;t think I would get<br/>\nthrough but I was busy doing stuff near the phone anyway<br/>\nand so figured I&#39;d try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During my install,<br/>\neverything went in except the Vpatch. This must happen quite<br/>\na bit b/c they just e-mailed me the vpatch program.<br/>\nI ran it, and afterwards, it put the button on my<br/>\nEQ main executable file. They seemed to know exactly<br/>\nwhat was going on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And since then, I also have<br/>\nnot lagged or dl&#39;d from Drinal (although that&#39;s only<br/>\n2 hours I&#39;ve been able to play since then).<br/>\nHopefully the patches fixed disconnect and lag issues for<br/>\nme as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if anyone is missing that<br/>\nbutton-- one thing they did say was not to reinstall-- get<br/>\nthe vpatch program and save it to the EQ directory.<br/>\nRun the vpatch and everything will be<br/>\nalright.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman/FatedHue</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
