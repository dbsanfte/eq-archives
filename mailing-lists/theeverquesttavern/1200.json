The last time I saw them, they cost around<br/>\n1kpp (probably dropped a bit since then).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For<br/>\nless than that, you could get a Runic Carver - 18/37,<br/>\n2hs. Almost the exact same damage to delay ratio, plus<br/>\nyou will get more swings in. More swings = more aggro<br/>\n= good warrior. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or, if a sword is not to<br/>\nyour liking, you could pick up a Mithril Staff -<br/>\n28/45, 2hb. Again, better than the Mithril Staff in<br/>\nevery way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The haste proc on the Executioner&#39;s<br/>\nAxe seems to be more annoying than anything. Not only<br/>\nis the proc infrequent, it does overwrite enchanter<br/>\nhaste and lasts only 10 seconds. It&#39;s not really enough<br/>\nto make a difference you&#39;ll notice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could<br/>\neither the Carver or the Staff for under 1kpp, if not<br/>\nsubstantially less. I&#39;ve seen Carvers for sale around 500pp, so<br/>\nthat might be something to shoot<br/>\nfor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51 champion of Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
