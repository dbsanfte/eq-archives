Clurg<br/>\nhas his own faction. I have found no way of raising<br/>\nfaction with Clurg other than fulfilling the Stein<br/>\nquest....which you can&#39;t do until you have a high enough faction<br/>\nwith Clurg. Catch 22. Enchanters get around this using<br/>\nAlliance/Illusion spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details of the quest can be<br/>\nfound on other sites. My suggestion would be to get an<br/>\nenchanter friend to do the quest for you. The Stein isn&#39;t<br/>\nNo Drop, so he can give it to you once the quest is<br/>\ncomplete. All the items involved are No Drop (maybe the<br/>\nKiola nut isn&#39;t, not sure). If you wanted to be nice<br/>\nand help him, you could kill the Koalindal fish in<br/>\nQeynos for him, but let him loot. The fish is only like<br/>\nlevel 3, but you take a severe faction hit with the<br/>\nQeynos guards for killing it. But I&#39;d personally just<br/>\nstart a mule character in qeynos, get him to level 3 or<br/>\n4, and use him to kill the fish. My brother has a<br/>\nlevel 4 Cleric named Larinchi whose only purpose in<br/>\nlife is to kill the fish when I need another Stein<br/>\n:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar MirraGhost&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
