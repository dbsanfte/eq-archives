Not if I do it right","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1273992962\">Been reading up on a lot of different opinions<br/>\nhere. Will try to summarize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Snare isn&#39;t as<br/>\neasy to get taunted off as the rest. Not if I do it<br/>\nright away. If I wait for the taunters and damage<br/>\ndealers to do a bit first... then....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s the<br/>\nway to agro like you wouldn&#39;t believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the<br/>\ntank runs up, snare the mob and DS the tank. Almost<br/>\nalways-- any adds and often the snared-- will run to you.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re pulling, snare and dot. By the time it<br/>\ngets to your party-- it&#39;ll take ages to get the mob<br/>\noff you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Healing is another great way to have<br/>\npeels and also sitting. One trick I do is, first-- agro<br/>\nlike mad. Then when finally, it gets pulled off me...<br/>\nI back up a tick away. Sit... med a tick. Mob&#39;s<br/>\nalmost reached me by then. I run away and sit in time to<br/>\ncatch the tick. (I count off... one one thousand, two<br/>\none thousand, three one thousand-- TICK/SIT). Catch<br/>\nthe tick for to refresh mana with efficiency--<br/>\nrinse,wash,repeat. They&#39;ll chase you for about half their life -- if<br/>\nyou&#39;re not with a cleric/enchanter/bard/necro-- and<br/>\ndoing fear kiting. This is only for group kite-- mostly<br/>\nif I&#39;m pulling or kiting adds. Rarely do I solo--<br/>\nespecially since my specialty is Alteration. I care little<br/>\nfor kiting-- BORING-- even with trying quad.<br/>\nLOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhoo-- person I&#39;m with is getting ready to go so I need<br/>\nto hurry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Shaman rerinse issue. A lot of<br/>\nthe first 16 levels are gainable within a 24 hour<br/>\nperiod of online time. Admittedly-- that&#39;s a long time--<br/>\nalmost three weeks of play for me-- but Three weeks<br/>\nversus-- knowing your character and zone better, and etc.<br/>\nThat allows you to get a better feel for you<br/>\nclass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve restarted Druid 3 times and played numerous other<br/>\nclasses to level 10 or 12 just to get a feel for them.<br/>\nHelps a lot for everything. I knew I wanted more<br/>\nstarting Wis but still liked the way I spread more points<br/>\naround. I know my play style well and people love me in<br/>\ngroups usually-- I know what I&#39;m doing and it usually<br/>\n(USUALLY) shows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you can tell my inexperience<br/>\nwhen I play my bard. Getting better-- but the agro<br/>\nfactors still kill me. Juggling 3 songs causes more agro<br/>\nthan I would think and gotta be careful about the<br/>\nbalance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in other words-- sorry for the length-- It&#39;s up<br/>\nto you. If you had fun with your shaman-- in the<br/>\nlong run, restarting might prove very, very rewarding.<br/>\nI moved to another server on the last instance and<br/>\nit really proved interesting. I also tried<br/>\nrestarting on a same server once. Also rewarding. In the<br/>\nend, I&#39;d like to think I know as much as most druids<br/>\nLevel 36 and below and maybe some above-- on group<br/>\ndynamics. Kiting is definately my weak point... but I can<br/>\nlive without kiting. It&#39;s great exp-- but<br/>\nBORING.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic &lt;br&gt;Drinal server--<br/>\nTribunal of Antiquities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS ... heh... rambling<br/>\nmore than usual-- friend waiting</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
