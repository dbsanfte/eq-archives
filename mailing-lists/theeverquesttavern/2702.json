And looking at EQ&#39;s support page will not tell <br/>\nyou the correct fix for it. They claim that you should download a new <br/>\nEverQuest.exe file and run it. This will not fix the issue. If you <br/>\nread further on the page, they briefly talk about the patcher not <br/>\nworking correctly if Internet Explorer is not installed on your pc. <br/>\nThey FAIL to mention that you need to be running IE 5.5 or better for <br/>\nit to work at all. I was running 5.0 and it would not connect to the <br/>\npatcher. I downloaded and installed 5.5, rebooted, and WHAM! I&#39;m <br/>\nonline.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps you,<br/>\n<br/>\nTimmye Cousteau<br/>\n35 Druid of Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., &quot;a nomad soul&quot; &lt;sasank@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; YES!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         i spent hours downloading the patch<br/>\n&gt; still dont have the jagged pines patch<br/>\n&gt; and now my patcher wont connect<br/>\n&gt; ive checked my isp connection...tested it<br/>\n&gt; but the patcher still tells me to check my isp or contact sony<br/>\n&gt; im waiting for tech support to get back with me now<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; grrrrrr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; nomiea<br/>\n&gt; 44 wood elf druid<br/>\n&gt; xev server, ancient fellowship<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: zephlarus <br/>\n&gt;   To: theeverquesttavern@y... <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, July 24, 2002 7:36 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [The EverQuest Tavern] Patch Problems<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Has anyone else had trouble connecting to get the patch that came <br/>\nout <br/>\n&gt;   today?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
