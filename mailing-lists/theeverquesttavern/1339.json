Of course you want to try to get<br/>\nsomething better than Banded-- but can you afford<br/>\nit?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing I look at always is -- do I have enough<br/>\nmoney to purchase all the spells I want to get in my<br/>\nnext circle of spells. If I have enough, then I will<br/>\ngo ahead and buy. If not... no dice.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, I&#39;m not a very experienced player for the levels<br/>\n18 and above. However, I&#39;ve got at least 12<br/>\ncharacters between level 4 and 16. (Probably a lot more).<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve grouped almost all my character&#39;s lives past<br/>\nlevel 4. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So now with my level 22nd Druid, I<br/>\nkeep looking at EQ web sites for info on armor and<br/>\nweapons. That&#39;d be my advice for you. Look and try to find<br/>\nout what you&#39;re looking for and ask for price checks<br/>\non the item in your server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t have much<br/>\nexperience with Evil races unfortunately, but as far as<br/>\nkilling-- both Derv camps and Lavastorm will be cool places<br/>\nto kill... HOWEVER-- Lavastorm is much less camped<br/>\nand if you&#39;re looking for a group (and I always<br/>\nam)... I prefer Derv camps. Easy to form a group up<br/>\nthere. Exp will be a lot smoother b/c of grouping.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re looking to solo though, Lavastorm is<br/>\nperfect. I hate the Downtime from recovering from a fight<br/>\nthough. I did Lavastorm for a while and only got into two<br/>\ngroups. One was prearranged with friends ahead of time.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out... aka Fatedhue<br/>\nPrismatic of the Drinal Server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS Another comment<br/>\nabout the Derv Camps. Dervs drop cutthroat rings. These<br/>\ncan be used in quests to improve faction I believe.<br/>\nThat might be a consideration. If you can kill<br/>\nefficiently in a constant stream in a group at Lavastorm<br/>\nthough, I found loot to be great for level 12-15 range--<br/>\nalthough by 15 my exp there wasn&#39;t that great. By level 15<br/>\nI was in Oasis.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
