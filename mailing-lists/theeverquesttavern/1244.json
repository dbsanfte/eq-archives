I&#39;ve only seen one guild war before... and<br/>\nthat was when I was playing on the Veeshan server. It<br/>\nwas one of the best things I&#39;ve ever had the<br/>\npriviledge of witnessing. I don&#39;t know which guilds but<br/>\nman... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sparkling Bard spells, ppl running like<br/>\nmad men around all over. It must have lasted at least<br/>\n30 mins. I don&#39;t know if I ever saw a corpse though.<br/>\nBut man was there a TON of magic being flashed. It<br/>\ntook place in East Commons and spanned the whole zone.<br/>\nBig announcements about when it started and ended.<br/>\nPpl that walked into the zone asked what the heck was<br/>\ngoing on as ppl zipped around as if PVP. LOL! I loved<br/>\nit. It was sweet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One guild I&#39;d love to see in<br/>\na Guild war is the Mithril WarHammers.<br/>\nUnfortunately, I don&#39;t know of a similar matching Guild. The<br/>\nMiths are pretty large. Everywhere I go I see a couple<br/>\nof them. That&#39;s why I think it&#39;d be a good guild<br/>\nwar. Eh well.. I&#39;m just being rabling now.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out-- FatedHue, Druid of the 14th circle of<br/>\nDrinal-- Journeyman of Groups.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
