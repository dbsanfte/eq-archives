NO problem:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.<br/>\nSnare. The beasties hate it.&lt;br&gt;2. Flame Lick. They hate<br/>\nthat just as bad. For some reason Flame Lick creates<br/>\nmore hate than just about any other dot until you get<br/>\ninto the 40&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;3. Taunt. Lots of it. All the<br/>\ntime.&lt;br&gt;4. Journeyman&#39;s Walking Stick. Procs Tashani, which<br/>\ncreates a HUGE amount of aggro. Really pisses &#39;em<br/>\noff.&lt;br&gt;5. Don&#39;t stop hittin&#39; &#39;em!!&lt;br&gt;6. Taking damage. As<br/>\na ranger, I&#39;m going to get hit alot. Not as much as<br/>\nmost, because my AC is pretty damned high, but still<br/>\nmore than a warrior, pally, or SK of my level. Taking<br/>\ndamage from a creature creates hate. The lower you are<br/>\non life, the more likely they&#39;re going to continue<br/>\nwhaling on you until you&#39;re dead.&lt;br&gt;7. DS. I always<br/>\nthrow a damage shield up on myself before a tough<br/>\nfight. My barbcoat + thistleshield does 8 damage each<br/>\ntime they hit me. Doesn&#39;t sound like much, but it adds<br/>\nup. The mob hits me 20 times in a fight? That&#39;s 160<br/>\npoints of damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s about it. Rangers are<br/>\nVERY good at creating and keeping aggro. You just have<br/>\nto time your casting and taunts right, and you have<br/>\nto have a group that understands how to manage their<br/>\nown aggro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
