At 35, I&#39;m at 139<br/>\nwis, which I think is pitiful. My equip is about<br/>\nstandard for a non-twinked lvl 35. I say, go for it! It<br/>\nmay be a tough first character to play, but once you<br/>\nknow what EQ is all about, more difficult race/class<br/>\ncombos are all about variety. For example, I have a wood<br/>\nelf warrior who loves trade skills. But you can do<br/>\nwhatever you want. If you want a HE druid, make one! No<br/>\none can stop you, and if it is too hard, you can make<br/>\na new character and build on what you learned.
