I had this urge to visit<br/>\nLesser Faydark, so I zoned in . . . and found the body<br/>\nof an Undead Sprite Horror. Asked the people<br/>\nstanding around if it was theirs -- yup, and they&#39;re<br/>\nnasty. About 10 seconds later, another Undead Sprite<br/>\nHorror shows up, and a Brownie as well. By the time I<br/>\ncollected my wits, it was LOADING, PLEASE WAIT . .<br/>\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I got back to the zone entrance, someone else<br/>\n(also waiting to do a corpse recovery) suggested it was<br/>\na GM event. I though it might have to do with the<br/>\ncoming war . . . The sky was red, and as I walked<br/>\nthrough LFaydark, I saw MANY Undead Sprites, Sprite<br/>\nSpooks, and Sprite Horrors. I love Sneak/Hide with<br/>\nSoW.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Didn&#39;t find anything interesting, however, and the sky<br/>\ncleared up at about 1:00 a.m. Pacific time or<br/>\nthereabouts. Anyone have any idea what was going on? Is this<br/>\nrelated to the war, or something else? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On another<br/>\nnote, will a 12th level character be able to do<br/>\nanything other than hide in this war?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>\nKaladim&lt;br&gt;12th season rogue&lt;br&gt;Sleepy Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
