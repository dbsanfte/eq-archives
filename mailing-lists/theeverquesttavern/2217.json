Also, I am looking for<br/>\nfeedback on different servers. I do not want PvP, so I<br/>\nknow which ones to not start with; someone on Bertox<br/>\n(I think) was awfully nice to me, but does that mean<br/>\nI would have to be a follower of the evil god it is<br/>\nbased on? And I understand that Fennin Ro was te first<br/>\n&quot;role playing server, but I thought the whole EQ game<br/>\nwas roleplaying? I would not mind the servers where a<br/>\nlot of German players play.Ionly know enough German<br/>\nto get myself into (but not out of) trouble, but I<br/>\nam certainly not intimidated by it. Any thoughts<br/>\nwould be appreciated.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
