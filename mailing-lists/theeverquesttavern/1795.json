Everyone talks about clerics and<br/>\nwizzies agroing by heals/nukes, but there is a dynamic<br/>\nfor druids that i haven&#39;t yet figured out. Here are<br/>\nsome observations, though---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snare/Ensnare<br/>\nmakes mobs mad, but they are easily taunted from it.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A tank with a druid DS is far less likely to loose<br/>\nagro, even by heals/nukes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Druid dots don&#39;t<br/>\nseem to cause much hate AT FIRST, and generally don&#39;t<br/>\ncause a mob to break agro on a tank and come for you.<br/>\nException-- get too close and/or start melee. Example-- a mob<br/>\nis pulled, everyone bears down on it. I hit it with<br/>\nCreeping Crud and Immolate, cast a damage shield, wait a<br/>\nbit to make sure someone else has snared and that<br/>\nhealers are ok, and move it for melee and nuking up<br/>\nclose. I walk in, take a few wimpy druid hits, and the<br/>\nmob totally ignores the Warrior and monk and comes<br/>\nfor me. I take a few hits for the team and back<br/>\noff--mob goes back to hitting the DSd warrior.<br/>\nhmmmmm.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fear spells (druids&#39; on work on animals) don&#39;t seem to<br/>\ncause much hate-- probably cuz once it finally breaks,<br/>\nothers have done so much damage that that hate overrides<br/>\nit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;healing and nuking are the same for<br/>\ndruids as clerics/wizzies-- if you hit/heal to hard,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll pull them off in many cases. I NEVER heal above<br/>\n50% health-- i see clerics wasting GrHeal all the<br/>\ntime-- the secondary tank lost 2 bubs and isn&#39;t getting<br/>\nhit anymore, but he gets healed-- or the tank is down<br/>\n1 1/2 bubs of life and gets healed with Gr heal.<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that a waste??? PLUS--healing a nearly full<br/>\ncharacter is more likely to agro the mob on you (if a mob<br/>\nhas a character down to 40%, it&#39;s less likely to<br/>\nleave that guy AT ALL, especially after the recent<br/>\npatch affecting this situation--in my experience).<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quick way for a lvl 30 druid to die (just like for a<br/>\nwizzie)-- start unloading with combust on a freshly pulled<br/>\nmob. I&#39;ve seen druids do it, then run around screaming<br/>\n&quot;get it off me, get it off me!!!!&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A wizzie<br/>\nhas to be patient and wait for the right nuking<br/>\nopportunity. A druid has so many other options BEFORE he<br/>\nstarts nuking, that he doesn&#39;t have to get bored--<br/>\nsnare, DS, DOT....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My 2cp worth-- anyone know of<br/>\na Hate list?? (ie. what actions cause the<br/>\nmost/worst hate).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
