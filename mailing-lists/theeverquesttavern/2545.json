Since I know that<br/>\n&gt; I will be playing within a month to two months I<br/>\n&gt; need to have a char, just in case my others are wiped<br/>\n&gt; out. So I am thinking Enchanter, Druid and yes the all<br/>\n&gt; around basher Warrior. My question is this then. When<br/>\n&gt; you start the char they ask you to put the points in,<br/>\n&gt; so what is a good distrubition of these stats for<br/>\n&gt; each char type listed here? Also for these char thypes<br/>\n&gt; what are the better races? (I know for war the best is<br/>\n&gt; Troll &#39;cause they get regen, but the faction sucks so I<br/>\n&gt; might just go with Human.) Hmm..can&#39;t think of anything<br/>\n&gt; else so I guess I&#39;ll go for now. *yawn* have to get up<br/>\n&gt; early for work tomorrow. Night.
