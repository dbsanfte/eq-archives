I m a ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-57038038\">Ooops! Nope. Sorry. Patchwork, yes. Banded and<br/>\nbronze, no. You&#39;re a druid. Get used to the newbie look,<br/>\nyou&#39;re going to have it for a VERY long time. I&#39;m a<br/>\nlevel 30 wood elf druid, and I&#39;m wearing leather. Now,<br/>\ngranted, I have collected as much wisdom-enhancing items<br/>\nas I can get my grubbly little mitts on, but druids<br/>\ncannot wear anything much past leather. Later on,<br/>\nUlthork and Tizmak armor, as well as brown chitlin are<br/>\navailable, but unless you have someone helping you, you<br/>\nwon&#39;t be seeing these until you&#39;re well into your<br/>\n30&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My advice is to take up tailoring. Do it now. As a<br/>\nlevel 4, you can make your own patchwork for some<br/>\nsilver, and sell it for some gold. And you can make your<br/>\nown armor. Make friends with someone who smiths, and<br/>\nsomeone who brews. You&#39;ll need items from them, and they<br/>\nwill need items from you. Later on, you can make<br/>\nstudded (which is better than leather) then reinforced.<br/>\nEventually, cultural wood elf armor. Also, you can forage.<br/>\nKeep that skill maxed out. What I do is everytime I<br/>\nsit to med, I hit the forage key first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far<br/>\nas newbie quests, there isn&#39;t much that&#39;s<br/>\ndruid-specific. You can turn in those swords, but I found that<br/>\ndisappointing. Plus, at your level they&#39;re hard to find. Do the<br/>\nmail quest. Kill wolves... yes, yes, I know, wolves<br/>\nare friends of druids, but you&#39;ll be USING the pelts.<br/>\nIf you get a black wolf skin, turn it into the<br/>\nenchanter guild at Felwithe. Collect bone chips. Do NOT<br/>\nturn them in, sell them to players for about 3pp per<br/>\nstack. Same thing with bat wings. Keep a stack or two<br/>\nfor yourself, you&#39;ll need it later on. Collect<br/>\nspiderling silks, and make silk thread OR turn them into to<br/>\nbard guild four at a time. If you don&#39;t mind the<br/>\ntravel, deliver mail from Ak&#39;Anon to Kelethin... the pay<br/>\nis pretty good. Couple of plat, if I remember<br/>\ncorrectly. And remember, loot EVERYTHING! The people who get<br/>\nin the habit of not looting (monks are the<br/>\nexception, of course!) are the same ones begging favors<br/>\nlater one, and most people will do favors, but not give<br/>\nmoney.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
