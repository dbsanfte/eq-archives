BTW -- if you kill that SK near the dock you get<br/>\ngreat faction with the Mages of Erudin (espec. when you<br/>\nturn in his bones), but if you do it more than once,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll need to pro&#39;lly kill LOTS of kobolds in Warrens<br/>\nbefore you show your face again in Paineel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As<br/>\nfor Your Troll name -- have you simply tried &quot;Stan&quot;??<br/>\nI would love to see that -- and then the surname<br/>\n&quot;Lee&quot; to follow, or maybe &quot;Daman.&quot; I have a group of 3<br/>\nfriends and we&#39;re all going to start either trolls or<br/>\nogres -- can&#39;t wait to run over the hills toward the<br/>\norc lift in Kelethin shouting &quot;ME BASH DEM ELFSIS!!!&quot;<br/>\nand see the newbies run and scream!!!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela<br/>\n(5 kills from being named Orcbane)&lt;br&gt;19th seasoned<br/>\ndruid&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
