Dual wield gives you<br/>\nthe opportunity to wield another weapon in your<br/>\noff-hand. Now, as your skill in dual wield rises, so will<br/>\nthe number of swings your off-hand will get. Also<br/>\nfactored into this is the delay of the weapon in your<br/>\noff-hand; generally, the lower, the better, without<br/>\nsacrificing too much power. If you have a weapon with a high<br/>\ndelay in your off-hand, don&#39;t expect to see many swings<br/>\nwith it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, your damage caps will be removed<br/>\nat level 20, and will also rise as you level after<br/>\nthis. You&#39;ll get a damage bonus only in your primary<br/>\nhand, so take this into thought as<br/>\nwell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
