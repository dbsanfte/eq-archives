This may or MAY NOT be a good place to<br/>\nstart. It will be a good place to create and have fun<br/>\nwith a charachter you want to roleplay, but this is<br/>\nnot any easy place to be a new player. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On FV<br/>\nthere is no &quot;common&quot; language, and you start of<br/>\nbasically understanding only the language of your race.<br/>\nThis makes it difficult to travel at first, and to<br/>\ncommunicate with others you may need/want to talk to. (ie. I<br/>\nplay a halfling on FV, and would love to buy some<br/>\nenchanted jewelry, but don&#39;t know enough elf to make my<br/>\ndesires known-- lots of elven enchanters where I am, and<br/>\nthere are NO halfling enchanters-- darn!!).<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, the ruleset on FV is very different from the<br/>\nregular set, with limitations on shouting, auctioning,<br/>\nlooting, speaking, grouping, and getting experience. Also,<br/>\nI think that FV is the only server where a<br/>\ncharacter takes on an alignment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Regular&quot; servers<br/>\n(not including PvP ones) are more of a<br/>\ncommunity/social experience than a roleplay experience. If you<br/>\nreally are new, my suggestion would be to make a char.<br/>\non any other server to get a feel for the game. You<br/>\ncan then ask others specific questions and you&#39;ll<br/>\nhopefully get some help. Then, when you&#39;ve gotten a hang of<br/>\nit, you can switch over and make a char. on FV server<br/>\nfor some good old fashioned role play<br/>\nfun!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
