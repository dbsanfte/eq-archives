Many quests are certain<br/>\nrace, class or faction only. Most classes have a few<br/>\nnewbie quests, maybe an intermediate quest, a highlevel<br/>\nquest and an epic. Others have very few-- (where are<br/>\nthe wood-elf druid quests?? Start by collecting rust<br/>\nweapons? ack-- do it once for fun, then that&#39;s it-- if you<br/>\nwander to Felwithe you can get the Symbol of Tunare<br/>\nquests from the cleric guild-- tough to complete, but<br/>\nyou get a cool, upgradable item for your adventures<br/>\ninto dangerous Lesser Faydark)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many quests that<br/>\nexist are too painstaking to complete-- ie Anyone got a<br/>\nJaggedpine Cloak (or whatever it&#39;s called)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are<br/>\nsome great quests for high xp and loot for around<br/>\nlevel 10-- CB belts and pads not only give great xp,<br/>\nbut you get loot to equip or sell, AND you can keep<br/>\nfarming belts and pads to sell for plat. Same is true for<br/>\nthe DF belts in EC/WC -- quests in Freeport give you<br/>\ngreat xp and gold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choosing wisely your hunting<br/>\nareas and being good at auctioning are keys to getting<br/>\nplat (also some tradeskills, but I wont go into that<br/>\nhere). I&#39;m not sure about Pallys, but I would assume<br/>\nthat there must be somewhere you can go to fight<br/>\nundead that drop FS weapons (sell to merchants for about<br/>\n5pp and to players for about 10pp). Maybe Unrest.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giant camps in Kunark (Forrest in WW and Mountain in<br/>\nFM) are good places to group-- you have a shot at the<br/>\nForrest Loops and Foreman&#39;s geat, plus most stuff that<br/>\ndrops off these giants (ie legchopper) sell for GREAT<br/>\nplat at merchants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you go through life just<br/>\nfighting and selling stuff to merchants, though, you will<br/>\nnot get rich quick. Unfortunately, it takes putting<br/>\nin the auction time to get serious pp.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
