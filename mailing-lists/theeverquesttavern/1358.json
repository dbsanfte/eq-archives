Those work against Undead only. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if it stacks with normal invis. Camo<br/>\n(druid/ranger version of invis) does not work indoors. Neither<br/>\nunfortunately, does SOW.

I love those ppl.<br/>\nThey cover my behind-- which is darned<br/>\nugly).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best thing to do is invis yourself and ALWAY con<br/>\nsomething before you get too close if you&#39;ve never been<br/>\ninvis around it before.
