Or, you can try installing the game on another <br/>\ncomputer and see if the error comes up. If it doesn&#39;t, go ahead and <br/>\ncopy the file you need from there onto a CD or something and then re-<br/>\ncopy over to your main system. I had a problem similar when <br/>\ninstalling Wizardry 8. One of the sound.cab files couldn&#39;t install on <br/>\none of my boxes, so I installed the game on another machine and <br/>\nbingo, it worked. That means there&#39;s a problem with my CD drive (I <br/>\nnever bothered fixing it because it only appeared to effect Wizardry <br/>\nonly and not the other games). It&#39;s probably a driver issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nYager</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
