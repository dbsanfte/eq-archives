The next morning it was frozen in place. Well, I<br/>\nhad to get to school on time so I drove, hoping it<br/>\nwould thaw out quickly. Well, it didn&#39;t. Now my<br/>\ntransmission is messed up and I have to get it fixed. I&#39;m a<br/>\nlittle short on cash, so I really need to sell my lvl 47<br/>\ncleric on Povar. I havn&#39;t played him in about 2 months.<br/>\nHe is kunark enabled, but not velious. He has about<br/>\n180 wis w/ just decent items, 200 wis is very<br/>\nobtainable. Some of his items include donals vambraces, totem<br/>\nof warrior spirit. He is not very well known with a<br/>\ngreat reputation, even before I stopped playing. I was<br/>\ngetting him ready to apply for one of the best guilds on<br/>\nPovar, but I moved and never had a chance to follow<br/>\nthrough. I kinda feel like a bum askin, but if anyone is<br/>\ninterested, at all, pls email me at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stugger@...\">stugger@...</a>. Im<br/>\nnot looking for big bucks, $150 would be plenty<br/>\nenough, as I need cash decently quick. If I keep driving<br/>\non my tranny like this, its going to be poop when<br/>\nsummer comes around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks alot&lt;br&gt;bob d</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
