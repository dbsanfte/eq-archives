Very<br/>\ninteresting. I have seen the flirting issue from both sides--<br/>\nas i play a male and a female character, and enjoy<br/>\ntalking, chatting and flirting all the time. When I&#39;m in a<br/>\ngroup, I talk a LOT between battles. I like to :wink,<br/>\n/smile, /blush, etc. and like to keep everyone happy. I<br/>\nwould not get married (my characters or too young to be<br/>\ntied down-- hehe), but I think it&#39;s fun that others<br/>\ndo. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good players and people are hard to find.<br/>\nI love to group with people I know, and I&#39;m sad if<br/>\nthose people leave me behind (ie. get too far ahead in<br/>\nlevels so that we don&#39;t group together any more) or I<br/>\nleave them behind. If you find someone you like playing<br/>\nthe game with, why not marry them? Isn&#39;t that much<br/>\nlike real life?? My only questions is this: If a male<br/>\nchar and female char, controlled by RL people from<br/>\nCalifornia (or other community property state) split up--<br/>\ndoes the femal char. get 1/2 of the male chars armor,<br/>\nweapons, items and cash in bank????&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just<br/>\nwondering....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 20th season&lt;br&gt;Tactics<br/>\nOfficer- Defenders of Mithril<br/>\nHall&lt;br&gt;Xev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serrafina&lt;br&gt;Mage of the 20th summoning&lt;br&gt;LoreMistress- Defenders<br/>\nof Mithril Hall&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
