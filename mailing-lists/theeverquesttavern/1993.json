In general<br/>\nthat is. And it&#39;s specifically all devoted for gaming.<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen Xbox graphics for things like Soul Calibur<br/>\n2, and a few other RPGs and been sorely tempted to<br/>\nget one but no $$$ available unfortunately and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t spend what I don&#39;t have yet (unless it&#39;s an<br/>\nemergency )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gamecube has one game that I look at to<br/>\nmake me wonder if Mario, and Metroid aren&#39;t going to<br/>\nmake a come back. That game is Rogue Squadron. Star<br/>\nWars is aways big but the nice user interface coupled<br/>\nwith the graphics and immensity of the game promises<br/>\nwell. If the other games are anything<br/>\nclose...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out (late for classes again... lol)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
