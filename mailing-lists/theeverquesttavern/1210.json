I always thought that my Dark Elf should<br/>\nbe able to see alot better than my Erudite instead<br/>\nof only alittle better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found out that my<br/>\nGamma setting was almost all the way to the bottom. Boy<br/>\nwhat a difference it makes when you raise that up a<br/>\nbit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also I played for almost a month before a<br/>\nfriend in the game enlightened me to the fact that there<br/>\nis music. Like battle music and the music that comes<br/>\non when you come around certain things like the gate<br/>\nat the Qeynos newbie area. My music thing was set<br/>\nall the way down so I couldn&#39;t hear it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow<br/>\nI just thought that I would post about that here<br/>\nbecause if anybody out there doesnt know about these<br/>\nthings then your missin out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps<br/>\nsomeone and isnt just a waste of everyones<br/>\ntime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Venture&lt;br&gt;21 necro&lt;br&gt;Saryrn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
