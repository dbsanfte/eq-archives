Not to be<br/>\ndissentious, but ... when you get to a higher level, putting<br/>\none point into an skill gets you more starting level<br/>\nin that skill. EI... once you hit level 10-- the 1st<br/>\npoint you put in a skill starts you at either 5 or 10.<br/>\n(Correct me if I&#39;m wrong). So if it&#39;s a skill you don&#39;t<br/>\nuse much, I find it better to wait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For<br/>\nexample, if I&#39;m not going to use say, jewelry making till<br/>\nI hit level 30 or I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever use a<br/>\npiercing weapon... I might wait till level 30 and then<br/>\npump a point in it when I&#39;ve got a worthy weapon of<br/>\nthat type to use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That way I&#39;m making most<br/>\neffective use of my points and if I REALLY need to say --<br/>\npump a sudden 20 points in a skill I&#39;ve discovered is<br/>\nfar too low-- I won&#39;t hurt myself with wasted<br/>\npoints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman, Monk (6th)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... just presenting<br/>\nalternatives. And of course, anytime you get a new skill, put a<br/>\npoint in it. Unless of course it&#39;s the rogue&#39;s<br/>\ndetect/sense trap. Heh. Then just wait for the expansion,<br/>\nzone, and prac it. I just read the guide and it sounds<br/>\nlike you autogain ability to use it just by zoning.<br/>\nEven if you&#39;ve never put a point in it. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS.<br/>\nTrying to wade through all the prev messages on this<br/>\nboard. Up to like 723, and I&#39;ve watched Trellan get to<br/>\nlevel 47, leave, come back again, fade for a while and<br/>\nreannounce himself. I almost feel like I know the person.<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue &lt;br&gt;Druid of the 4th Tree hugging Ring...heh)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
