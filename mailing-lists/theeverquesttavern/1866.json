I am a hard-core Role-player, so although I have<br/>\na 58 Mage, I will never twink another<br/>\ncharacter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And 1 more thing, to all of you Shaman just starting<br/>\nout, you can get enough money for Totemic armor, I am<br/>\nonly lvl 18 on Sullon Zek, and I already have 2 pieces<br/>\nof Totemic.
