","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2088198347\">A few things:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) The Lake Rathe<br/>\ngnolls/undead right next to the SK zone line-- ahh. Brings back<br/>\nmemories. A few friends and I used to own that place.<br/>\nLOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s an easy spot to kill at actually with a good<br/>\ngroup. Usually when Aviaks get over camped, that&#39;s where<br/>\nwe&#39;d head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best part about it is it drops a<br/>\nfew low level magical weapons. Definately, you can<br/>\nget lots better but my druid appreciated the dropped<br/>\nstaff there. Or is my memory just fuzzy. There&#39;s also a<br/>\ngnoll in SK that runs around with a magic staff that<br/>\ngives like +5 mana too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) SK and the Arena.<br/>\nGet acquainted with those areas. Arena is a PVP zone.<br/>\nThe reason you want to know that zone is cause it is<br/>\nconsidered a &quot;city&quot;. Melee people can bind in there and it&#39;s<br/>\njust a short swim to Arena from SK zone/Lake Rathe<br/>\nzone line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That way if something goes wrong,<br/>\nya&#39;ll don&#39;t have to wait ages for your melee to get<br/>\nback. It&#39;s also a good way to build up swimming which<br/>\nis good to have in certain zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) &quot;You can<br/>\nkill annoying little shorties like Rondo Dunfire and<br/>\nthat little gnome in the pit (what&#39;s his name<br/>\nagain??).&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dunfire is okay. I don&#39;t mind killing him<br/>\nb/c he only gives you bad faction with Rogues and a<br/>\nfew other people. I forget exactly. But Rhelog (sp?)<br/>\nthe gnome guy. I can&#39;t believe I forget his name<br/>\ncause he&#39;s so annoying-- hate him, would love to kill<br/>\nhim--but don&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? Cause I&#39;m afraid of the<br/>\nnegative gnome faction he gives out. I could be wrong or<br/>\nthey might have changed it. But two years ago, he gave<br/>\nout some nasty Gnome City faction. I haven&#39;t been<br/>\nthere in forever but Steamfont is a gate I use from<br/>\ntime to time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Course if you&#39;re one of the many<br/>\nthat love to kill Gnome guards cause they&#39;re decent<br/>\nexp and loot at that level... then don&#39;t worry.<br/>\nForget what levels those guards are since I never attack<br/>\npoor innocent guards protecting cities. (well other<br/>\nthan say Centaurs or stuff that don&#39;t seem to<br/>\nacknowledge my killing off their members. ROFL. If they don&#39;t<br/>\ncare, why should I?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
