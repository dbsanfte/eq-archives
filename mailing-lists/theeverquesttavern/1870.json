Or is it that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-479249204\">So the true question is why don&#39;t we like twinks?<br/>\nIs it because they have an unfair advantage in<br/>\nleveling (high level buffs do the same thing)? Or is it<br/>\nthat they flaunt it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recently started an<br/>\nIksar monk. I made it through lvl 6 on my own, but then<br/>\na friend giving up EQ seriously twinked me. So, I&#39;m<br/>\nflighting white/yellows instead of blues. I&#39;m leveling<br/>\nquickly, I&#39;m already 12. I don&#39;t flaunt it, etc. But it<br/>\ndoes get annoying the number of characters that<br/>\ninspect me now. ;) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was also given a large<br/>\namount of plat, but I doubt I&#39;ll use any of it until the<br/>\nmid-twenties. Monks don&#39;t have to buy spells...this is my first<br/>\nnon-caster...wow, does money add up quickly!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, twinks<br/>\nthat want to duel? That&#39;s just plain mean! And of<br/>\ncourse, I don&#39;t think twinking is cool on PVP<br/>\nservers...it really is an unfair advantage. I do think that<br/>\ncertain items shouldn&#39;t be wearable until a certain level<br/>\non those servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a self-reliant type game<br/>\ngoes, I&#39;d have to disagree. I think EQ was built with<br/>\nthis type of thing in mind. Buffing, healing,<br/>\ntwinking...it&#39;s all very similar to me. Cast a skin like diamond,<br/>\na regen, SOW, STR, a DS, and a Clarity (for a<br/>\nnewbie caster), on a low-level person and they can fight<br/>\nyellows pretty easily. Granted, it&#39;s temporary, but when<br/>\nI had Breeze/Clarity cast on me, I could usually<br/>\nget one full bub of exp instead of 1 blue<br/>\nbub!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CoJim, Druid of the 26th<br/>\nseason&lt;br&gt;Shaojiku, Monk of the 12th trial&lt;br&gt;Prexus server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
