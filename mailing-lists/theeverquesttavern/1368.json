The software&#39;s on its<br/>\nway, and I should be ready to start playing EQ<br/>\ntomorrow evening (3/13). I come from an AD&D (actually<br/>\noriginal D&D, but who&#39;s counting) background, and for my<br/>\nfirst character, I&#39;ve decided to play what I know best<br/>\n-- a dwarf rogue (although I&#39;ll always think<br/>\n&quot;thief&quot;). Anyway, a couple of questions before I get too<br/>\nfar: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. How do I tell what server I&#39;m on? Can<br/>\nI change that (I assume not), or is it based on<br/>\nyour location/IP address? Are some servers better than<br/>\nothers? Do all the PK people play on the same<br/>\nserver?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Any suggestions on how best to set up my<br/>\ncharacter? Add points to Agility? Dexterity? Strength?<br/>\nIntelligence -- ?! (I sort of dislike the idea that dwarves in<br/>\nthis world are dumb.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. One guide suggested<br/>\nusing skill points only for the &quot;craft skills&quot; -- my<br/>\nthieving skills, in other words. Another suggested<br/>\nthrowing a point each at piercing and another weapon<br/>\nskill. Any ideas?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Clans -- do most people join<br/>\none, or maybe wait until later in their<br/>\ncareer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Anything else? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks in advance.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
