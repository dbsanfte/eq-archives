I dont<br/>\nthink there is much to hunt in oot at level 3. You<br/>\nshould go to west freeport and kill the stuff in the<br/>\nnewbie zone. I did this with my chanter on vallon zek I<br/>\ngot through level 1 - 4 in like 2 hours. My chanter<br/>\non vallon zek is untwinked and he did it by killing<br/>\nmostly blues. If you kill blues ya just have to kill a<br/>\nlot of them. Hope this helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
