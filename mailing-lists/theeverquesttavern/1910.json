Druids rule, lol.<br/>\n=D&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I think you should try the iksar. I&#39;ve never<br/>\nplayed one, but the monks look like they rule. My first<br/>\nchar was a cleric, and I was a *complete* newbie, so I<br/>\nhad no clue what I was doing. Luckily, I quickly made<br/>\na good friend (who is now uber, sheesh) and she<br/>\nhelped me out a LOT. Making friends helps a lot. I think<br/>\nreading up on casters realm or something is a good idea,<br/>\nbut you won&#39;t really know what you like until you&#39;ve<br/>\nspent time playing. I&#39;ve found I play healer classes<br/>\nbest, although I recently started a bard and love her,<br/>\nas well.&lt;br&gt;Best wishes with your adventures in<br/>\nNorrath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Kanissa Noryk, 35 druid of Norraths Keepers, Rodcet<br/>\nNife&lt;br&gt;~Catallus, the super-twinked bard of Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
