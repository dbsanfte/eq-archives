A subscription <br/>\ncard or credit card won&#39;t help you get past this hurdle. If you knew <br/>\nthe person who sold the software, you could ask them for the name and <br/>\npassword. But it&#39;s doubtful you would get it and even more risky as <br/>\ntheir information is registered as the owner of the account. Your <br/>\nbest bet would be to either buy the 9.99 cheapy basic EQ to get a <br/>\nfresh cd key or find the new jumbo pack which contains most of the <br/>\nexpansions along with the basic eq game.
