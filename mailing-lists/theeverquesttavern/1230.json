I&#39;ve been told that sometimes--<br/>\nif you get a tech that knows who&#39;s good at AOL-- you<br/>\ncan get them to registry hack for you. But the<br/>\nproblem is, trusting AOL for a registry<br/>\nhack?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, did you delete AOL or did you uninstall AOL? It<br/>\ndoes make a difference although AOL 6.0 almost makes<br/>\nit a moot point-- as many registry entries as its<br/>\nuninstall leaves behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is likely AOL<br/>\nconflicting with Bellsouth if you&#39;re getting connection<br/>\nboots. Also it could be possible Bellsouth has been set<br/>\nto disconnect after 10 or 15 mins if you don&#39;t click<br/>\n&quot;yes stay connected&quot;. There&#39;s the possibility that<br/>\nthat&#39;s coming up in the background and you can&#39;t see it<br/>\nb/c of course EQ takes up everything and then you get<br/>\ndisconnected-- which of course punts you from EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope<br/>\nsome of this helps and you don&#39;t end up having to<br/>\nFormat, Reinstall. Course if you have WinME, just do a<br/>\nsystem restore to before you had issues. ME has its<br/>\nflaws but system restore rocks. ME allocates 400MBs to<br/>\nSystem Restore and each restore table takes 3+kb AND you<br/>\ncan make up to 9 user restore points on any given day<br/>\n(for a total of 10 in one day). Course it takes over<br/>\nHDD&#39;s and puts itself in the boot sector, has a super<br/>\nhidden io.sys that can&#39;t be deleted or even found in DOS<br/>\n(try to derash it from a boot disk- gluck finding it--<br/>\ncan in versions up to Win2k though). It&#39;s hard to<br/>\ncrash completely though. If you know what you&#39;re doing,<br/>\nyou can deletely Hkey_Local registries and still fix<br/>\nit without a format. Still, the fact that an<br/>\nfdisk/format doesn&#39;t completely remove it from an HDD is a<br/>\nbummer. (sorry. Have had to deal with the ups and downs<br/>\nof ME for a while. Sigh/grin)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m<br/>\nrambling. Gluck&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
