Taken from<br/>\nalakazam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bandit Sisters: This starts in Felwithe with the High<br/>\nElf Paladin Guildmaster. He will ask you if you are<br/>\n&quot;ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare&quot; Say &quot;I am ready<br/>\nto serve the Clerics of Tunare&quot; and he will ask if<br/>\nyou are new to this or experienced (something to that<br/>\ndegree). If you say you are inexperienced, he tells you<br/>\nabout a fallen member of his order in Kelethin. (If you<br/>\nsay you are experienced, he gives you the jojongua&#39;s<br/>\npelt quest). You then need to talk to the drunk named<br/>\nTandan Nybright in Kelethin and listen to his tale. His<br/>\nsad story centers around his four daughters in Lesser<br/>\nFaydark who have joined the dervish cutthrouat and are<br/>\ngiving his family a bad name. Being a good father and<br/>\npaladin, he asks you to murder each of his daughters,<br/>\nretrieve their pearl necklaces and return them to him all<br/>\nat once. Beware. These bandits are pretty tough and<br/>\nwill not willingly part with their jewelry<br/>\n(approximately level 10 to 13). You will get experience, faction<br/>\nand an item when you return all four necklaces.<br/>\nSometimes your reward is a Targ Shield.
