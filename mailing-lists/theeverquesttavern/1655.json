Ok. Lesser Faydark has probably been<br/>\ncorrupted on all servers now. Here&#39;s my observation on The<br/>\nRathe:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lots of undead sprite class creatures flying<br/>\naround. Most are green to me at 26. However, the Undead<br/>\nSprite Horrors WILL attack you. They are very<br/>\naggressive! They harm touch for 171. They also sometimes proc<br/>\nrejuvenate during combat. This will fully heal you and<br/>\nrecharge your mana! Quite weird! They also cast clinging<br/>\ndarkness. This makes you move like you are snared and also<br/>\ndrops all speed buffs including wolf form!&lt;br&gt; Of<br/>\ncourse, dropping wolf form makes the brownies want to<br/>\nkill you! Try to keep cancel magic and wolf form<br/>\nmemmed if possible. &lt;br&gt; The U.S. Guards/Guardians drop<br/>\ntwice woven silk, twice woven cloak and power of earth,<br/>\nall for mage quests. &lt;br&gt; Good exp for a good hunter.<br/>\nI went from 25 to 26 in about 6 hours. Made about<br/>\n130pp. This was all solo work. Went in last night for<br/>\nabout 60 min, just under a yellow bubble and 20 pp. Not<br/>\nfast but fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye Cousteau&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Wolf<br/>\nof Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
