If he doesn&#39;t say anything, and begins to<br/>\ndrop below 40% health with a majority of the train<br/>\nstill on board, swing away. It may save his life, and<br/>\nit will save anyone who is nearby that may have died<br/>\nwhen he did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and now... I have a<br/>\nconfession:&lt;br&gt;I killed a man.&lt;br&gt;I wasted a cleric.&lt;br&gt;Flat out<br/>\nleveled him down to the ground.&lt;br&gt;I can&#39;t stand it, I<br/>\nhave to get it off my chest.&lt;br&gt;He was sitting too<br/>\nnear the gypsies in North Karana when the enchanter<br/>\none charmed me and went beserk. I had no idea, no<br/>\ncontrol. All I knew was my screen said, &quot;You have slain<br/>\nSo-and-So&quot; I thought OMG I killed a player... I soon snapped<br/>\nout of my charm and wasted the gypsy, then cried over<br/>\nthe young cleric I had wasted. I tried to find him a<br/>\nresurrection in the zone. I apologized profusely, and offered<br/>\nhim all the platinum I had on me in hopes he would<br/>\nforgive me. If my memory was better, I would apologize<br/>\nagain now, but alas, my memory kinda bites. He took it<br/>\npretty well, and we laughed about it a little later. But<br/>\nmy hands have felt the blood of a player, and I am<br/>\nscarred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Cleric Hunter of Spiritus<br/>\nValorum&lt;br&gt;Master Potter, Brewer, and Drinker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
