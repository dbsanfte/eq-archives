This is the most addictive game I <br/>\npersonally have ever played. probably because in most games, you buy <br/>\nit, play it, defeat it, and move onto the next game. With EQ there <br/>\nare events, guildies, and chatting with people from all over the <br/>\nworld. I&#39;f your ever on &quot;Quellious&quot; feel free to send me a tell. I <br/>\ntried other servers and was quickly bored with being a newbie in the <br/>\ntrue sense of the word... LMAO. I hate having to start at the bottom, <br/>\nscrape together pp for things because no way in __ I&#39;m begging or <br/>\nasking for it, and than meeting new people that usually end up <br/>\nquitting EQ or are more interested in hooking up in RL. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need help with members to start a guild in the future let me <br/>\nknow and I&#39;ll create one, leave it there, so you have the amount <br/>\nneeded. The downside is web design, management, if members fight or <br/>\ndon&#39;t get long the childish games, and so on... but in the end it can <br/>\nfeel good to be running your own thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n._.-~*~-.Beverly R.-~*~-._.-~*~-._<br/>\n <br/>\nP.O.

After selling my computer<br/>\n&gt; to buy a plane ticket home from chicago I have gone<br/>\n&gt; without EQ for 5 months now, and in 2 months time I<br/>\n&gt; will be returning to this wonderful realm under the<br/>\n&gt; guise of a warrior.  And If I can pay off a friend of<br/>\n&gt; mine IRL I will be starting with a full suit of cobalt<br/>\n&gt; armor, so look for the newbie in cobalt on the<br/>\n&gt; Tribunal.  Good luck all I will post when I am up and<br/>\n&gt; running again.   Sincerely, PsyKo<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
