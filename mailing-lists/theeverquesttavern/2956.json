Just<br/>\n&gt; introducing myself.  I have been playing EverQuest<br/>\n&gt; since June of 2002.  Can&#39;t really say that this game<br/>\n&gt; is easy, I have had some problems (for instance<br/>\n&gt; dying in every zone).  But I guess you have to live<br/>\n&gt; and learn.  I don&#39;t know many secrets about the<br/>\n&gt; game, but just throw basically any topic at me and I<br/>\n&gt; will comment on it.
