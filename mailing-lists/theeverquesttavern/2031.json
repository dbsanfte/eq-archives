I made some friends and I played with them almost<br/>\n24/7. I have started and deleted a character from just<br/>\nabout every class there is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now, most of my old<br/>\nfriends are gone. The ones that still play have leveled<br/>\nthere characters to far for me to play with them<br/>\nanymore. I still love playing, but I seem to find that it<br/>\nis not as much fun as before. I currently have 5<br/>\ncharacters, the highest being a level 24 druid. My friend,<br/>\nwho started his druid after I did mine, is now at<br/>\nlevel 48. Granted I was away from EQ for a 3 months<br/>\nperiod, where my friend was playing to beat the band.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; My friend has been playing longer than I have. He<br/>\nhas a nack for knowing what mobs to kill to get the<br/>\nbest XP vs LOOT ratio. I on the other hand have been<br/>\nat level 24 ten times now. I have a nack for dieing<br/>\nand losing my level again and again. It is very<br/>\nfrustrating to watch someone level so fast, while you get<br/>\nstuck behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I find myself not playing EQ<br/>\nquite as much as I once did. Is there anyone else here<br/>\nwho has had similar problems? If so, were you able to<br/>\nmake it fun again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks for letting me vent.<br/>\n:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brendel Bushwaker 24 Druid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
