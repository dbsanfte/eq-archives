You get<br/>\nsomething new and you give your old stuff away, either to a<br/>\nguild mate maybe or to one of your other characters. I<br/>\ndont like the EC market and wonder how some of these<br/>\nppl get the items they sell.&lt;br&gt;As for the ability to<br/>\nuse certain items, that sort of exists now. Example,<br/>\nbeing a Shadow Knight myself one of my guild mates<br/>\nfound a Dark Reaver and gave it to me. I can use the<br/>\nsword but being lvl22 only it wont proc steal strength<br/>\nfor me yet. I get the message &quot;your will is not<br/>\nstrong enough to control this weapon&quot;. But the sword is<br/>\nstill cool to have.&lt;br&gt;As for the sex thing, sometimes<br/>\nI wonder how ppl take a perfectly good game and<br/>\nturn it into a soap opera! I mean, getting married and<br/>\nstuff? Give me a break!&lt;br&gt;Also I know a lot of players<br/>\nwho play opposite gender characters. Most of the guys<br/>\nplay girls because other players tend to walk up and<br/>\ngive you stuff more, and are more willing to help you.<br/>\nI think the girls play guys to keep from getting<br/>\nhit on so much. I though could never play a female<br/>\ncharacter, it would just be too weird for me.&lt;br&gt;Well enough<br/>\nrambling, I guess I also fit into the techie thing being an<br/>\nengineer, we are just not right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uinan<br/>\nD&#39;Mortuus&lt;br&gt;22nd Season SK of Erolissi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
