You can easily make a level an hour there with a good group and no matter what server, there are always groups open in Paludal. =)  Once you hit 24 - 29 is up for grabs....never found any one place better than the other xp-wise.  At 29 head to Velious and get to Crystal Caverns.  Get to the &quot;town&quot; inside the caverns and you can either get with a group or solo relatively easily here (if solo&#39;ing, stay close to town and know when to run!)  I solo&#39;d for 3 levels there as a Cleric! =)  I have an enchanter friend that stayed from 29 all the way to 42!! LOL  I would leave around 36-39 and head to Sol B...you can stay in Sol B until high 40&#39;s if you want.  =)  Also, being a Ranger....you can go to the Dreadlands and Root/Dot Yeti&#39;s very very safely if you need to solo...not much loot, but very good xp for levels 38-45.  Those seem to be the absolute best xp places for their respective levels.
