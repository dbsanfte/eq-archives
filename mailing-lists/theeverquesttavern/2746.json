My crowning <br/>\nachievement so far (150 days played, cause I love to &#39;smell the <br/>\nflowers&#39;) is lvl 60 epiced shaman with complete spellbook<br/>\n(no &#39;Ancient Scrolls&#39; yet) and 25 AA pts. Even after playing EQ for <br/>\nthis amount of time there is so much I am unfamiliar with, mostly the <br/>\nold world, feel like newbie often :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do however have humble knowledge of the Barbarian Shaman class, the <br/>\ncontinent of Antonica and many of the kunark and velious zones. I <br/>\nhang out mostly in luclin zones atm. I belong to a smallish guild (60 <br/>\nmembers) that I have been in for 2 years (since early 30&#39;s) we are <br/>\njust now approaching some of the higher end encounters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I will learn from you folks and hopefully be able to <br/>\ncontribute in some humble manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nKamorm Winterstalker<br/>\nOralce of Coinfist <br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
