I<br/>\nlearned this around level 6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dodge is an avoidance<br/>\ndefensive skill. Therefore, it will automatically rise when<br/>\nit is praticed in battle. Dodge goes off randomly -<br/>\nit basically means you will avoid more attacks with<br/>\nit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are certain checks when a mob attacks<br/>\nyou.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-The mob can hit you.&lt;br&gt;-The mob can just miss you on<br/>\nhis own.&lt;br&gt;-The mob can hit you, but you use your<br/>\nDefense to avoid it or you Dodge/Block/Riposte. Block is<br/>\na form of Dodge that can block magical attacks, and<br/>\nRiposte is like Dodging an attack and counterattacking<br/>\nonce at the same time. However, your Riposte can miss<br/>\nor can be Riposted as well. Riposte can avoid<br/>\nattacks from any direction, but for you to counterattack,<br/>\nyou must be facing the mob you Riposted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It<br/>\nsounds confusing, but it makes more sense if you read it<br/>\nover several times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, any time a mob<br/>\nswings at you, your defensive skills are practiced. They<br/>\ndon&#39;t always go up when they are successful - my<br/>\nDefense has been raised even when I&#39;ve been hit by<br/>\nmobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With any combat skill you learn as you level, you must<br/>\nput one point in it. Just one. Your guildmaster<br/>\nteaches you the basics. Then, while you practice it<br/>\nduring combat, the skill will go up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must warn<br/>\nyou that these raise very slowly, so don&#39;t expect<br/>\nthem to raise extremely quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to keep spending your points in your combat<br/>\nskills. Just practice them (automatically attacking with<br/>\nyour fists will raise the skill points of Hand to<br/>\nHand, for instance).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for your weapons<br/>\nquestion...it depends on certain factors. Weapons will be quite<br/>\nheavy. 2 Jade Maces weigh 4.2 stones together, and<br/>\nthat&#39;s one of the lighter of the uber weapon<br/>\ncombinations. It&#39;s whether or not you can make the room for<br/>\nthem with light gear and weight reducing bags (or if<br/>\nyou&#39;re willing to take the AC hit) that determines<br/>\nwhether you should use them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have a good<br/>\ntank in your group, the mobs shouldn&#39;t be hitting you<br/>\nanyway, but rather your tank, so the AC loss wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\na big factor in this case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, as you<br/>\nraise in level, you&#39;ll go on raids. These will most<br/>\nlikely start around level 40-45 or so with Fire Giants<br/>\nin Sol B. As a monk, unless you are pulling (which<br/>\nyou probably will be :), you can swap out AC gear for<br/>\ndamage gear, provided there are good tanks taking most<br/>\nof the damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or you could just get the epic<br/>\nmonk weapon. :) With the effect of the Celestial<br/>\nFists, you have two 9/16 weapons as your fists with<br/>\nlittle weight. However this is a very difficult and<br/>\nlengthy quest, level 50+.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC is important, but not<br/>\nin all cases. Day to day, yes, it&#39;s important. But<br/>\nsometimes you can modify your gear for the situation. You<br/>\nwill learn how to work with this as you gain levels<br/>\nand equipment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51 champion of<br/>\nPrexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
