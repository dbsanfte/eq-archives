Sorry I am not too computer swavey): <br/>\n<br/>\nI know for a fact it has a pen II<br/>\numm..the processor? is that the chip? 200MHz..I think? Is that <br/>\nwritten on the mother board itself? &#39;cause if it is I can check that <br/>\ntomorrow night and post that for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a cobbled together computer so I really didn&#39;t buy it from a <br/>\nstore. (My friends helped me put it together after I smoke checked <br/>\nthe last hard drive.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 10G HD<br/>\n<br/>\n56X CD-Rom<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment I have 230MB? of RAM. It uses some old mem chips and <br/>\nSDRAM.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the new vid card:<br/>\nIt&#39;s a Verto. Specs are: GeForce2 MX200 32MB SDRAM<br/>\n2D/3D Graphics processor. It&#39;s AGP (The vid card I have in right now <br/>\nis a PCI)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the side of the box it says for minimum requirements:<br/>\nIntel Pen II, 1 availabe AGP slot, 64MB Ram, CD-Rom Drive, 10MB <br/>\navailable disk space, Win 95/98 or higher, Win NT 4.0 with service <br/>\npack 5 or 6, and Linux OS<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got all of that, I think. I don&#39;t know what these are:<br/>\nWin NT 4.0 with service pack 5 or 6, and Linux OS <br/>\nSo I can&#39;t tell you if they are on my comp or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a store not too far from where I live that is really cool <br/>\nabout computers. Apparently they are buying computers all the time, <br/>\nand of course selling them too. I went to Best Buy (As it is close to <br/>\nwhere I live) and the cheapest system they have is for $599.00. That <br/>\nis a bit out of my price range (LOL Like $300.00). And all of the <br/>\nsystems are Pen IV and have Win XP on them. I only want a Pen III and <br/>\nI definatly want to keep Win 98! <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this info helps. Like I said, there is that computer store not <br/>\ntoo far from here. A friend of mine is going to take me there this <br/>\nFriday so I can check it out and see how cool they are. I&#39;m sure that <br/>\nthere is going to be a price difference, but I don&#39;t know how much <br/>\nsince I want to keep my hard drive and mem sticks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
