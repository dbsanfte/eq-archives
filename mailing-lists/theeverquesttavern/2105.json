And I know that the reason I abandoned the monk I had was b/c the money","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1253102274\">Don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting the Iskar monks<br/>\ndo less damage than regular.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I know that<br/>\nthe reason I abandoned the monk I had was b/c the<br/>\nmoney issue hurt badly. And yes, I was saying that that<br/>\nwas a drawback of all monks. There had been one point<br/>\nwhere someone was asking about what classes and combos<br/>\nwere good to play. Sounded like a new player. Don&#39;t<br/>\nplay monk if you don&#39;t want to have to worry about<br/>\nmoney as a newbie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yes, perm sight is<br/>\navailable. But you have to find the thing. I know that&#39;s an<br/>\nitem I haven&#39;t seen much of or even seen sold much.<br/>\nExcept for sometimes in NFP and already having monk cash<br/>\nproblems-- I couldn&#39;t afford to purchase it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back to<br/>\ndual wield. Thanks. Didn&#39;t know humans also get dual<br/>\nwield at level 1. But I know that at level 7 with<br/>\nnothing more than fists and no special gloves, I was<br/>\ndoing a lot more damage than my human monk at the same<br/>\nlevel. I can take out even cons with barely a scratch at<br/>\nlevel 7. I went through level 1 to 5 with no equipment<br/>\nas an Iskar monk and having never played in Calabis<br/>\nin about 2 days, 3 1/2 hours of play. I knew FP and<br/>\nmy human monk did no where as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the<br/>\nconditions where equally equiped monks. Which usually tips<br/>\nthe favor into Iskar monks. If damage is less for<br/>\nIskar, I haven&#39;t noticed it. My fists (again no weapons,<br/>\nno special gloves) do about 1 to 17 per fist<br/>\n(average 10) and every 4 or so attacks my other fist<br/>\nlands. Sooooo....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless there&#39;s a huge<br/>\ndifference, I&#39;ve played human monk to level 9 with much<br/>\neffort and played maybe at most 6 hours to get to level<br/>\n7 monk iskar with no problems. Didn&#39;t even die but<br/>\ntwice as an Iskar monk and once from mend wound killing<br/>\nme when it crit failed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.. keep in mind my level 39 druid has equipment so<br/>\nlousy that 4 levels ago, someone asked if I was about<br/>\nthe delete the character so gave my items away. I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t afford to do anything but give my monk 3<br/>\nbackpacks for his bank.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
