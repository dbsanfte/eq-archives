The instant you hit 15 pounds.. get rid of<br/>\nsomething or go sell. You lose your monk bonus AC. To give<br/>\nya an idea... some level 11 monk friend of mine<br/>\ndropped 200+ AC points when he hit 15 lbs. (Something<br/>\nlike that)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Practice mend and Feign death<br/>\nCONSTANTLY. You want to mend whenever it&#39;s available -- cause<br/>\nbefore you master it.. it can cause you damage with crit<br/>\nfailures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feign death is important b/c it helps you with pulls...<br/>\nmonks often are given the role of puller and since they<br/>\ndo lotsa damage.. sometimes they need to feign death<br/>\njust to get the mob back to the tank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll want to practice Safe Fall. It&#39;s just too useful<br/>\nin a variety of things. Running ragged from a pull<br/>\n(SK aviaks come in mind-- monks with good safe fall<br/>\nand feign rock as pullers).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) RP comes from<br/>\nwhatever you want to bring together as your monk. I play<br/>\nvery impish silly sorts with a sense of inner being.<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I always do something Elvish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>\nout</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
