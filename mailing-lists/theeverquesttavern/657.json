I stopped playing my wizard at level 6.<br/>\nThe feedback I&#39;d read from many experienced players,<br/>\nmade me realize that I would be really depressed if I<br/>\ncontinued. So I&#39;ve started and Enchanter and am having a lot<br/>\nof fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizards have DD, teleport, and<br/>\nroot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizard DD is about 5-15% more effective than mages and<br/>\ndruids and those classes have features that more than<br/>\noutweigh this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are playing a class that can<br/>\nteleport and nuke, Druid is soooooo much more versatile,<br/>\nthey can heal for example. If you just like to nuke, a<br/>\nmage pet is a handy thing to have around. If you like<br/>\nto solo, play a necro or a mage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The class is<br/>\nnot broken and can bring value to a group, but<br/>\nWizzies are not a required class. I would much rather<br/>\nplay a cleric for example. Boring, maybe, but very<br/>\nmuch needed by other players. Wizards have no role<br/>\nthat cannot be filled by other classed, other than<br/>\nAlter Plane Hate. Bottom line is there is still a huge<br/>\n&#39;suck factor&#39; that needs to be addressed.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
