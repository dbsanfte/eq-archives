Cahlia here, 19th season wood elf druid, who is trying<br/>\n&gt; desperately to level to 20 and claim my surname heheh! Oy I hate<br/>\n&gt; taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyhow, I was looking up a quest yesterday and found one I am<br/>\n&gt; interested in. Starts in Felwithe talking to the high elf who stands<br/>\n&gt; by the water and tells you he is troubled by his son&#39;s disappearance,<br/>\n&gt; please talk to someone else. I found that if you go to Befallen and<br/>\n&gt; kill a skeletal foreman, it will spawn Sir (something or other starts<br/>\n&gt; with an A). I got the directions, etc. He gives you a token you take<br/>\n&gt; back and give to the high elf and he gives you his daughter&#39;s token.<br/>\n&gt; A pretty cool amulet with 3AC, +3wis, +3int, +3 cha, +3Sta, and +3<br/>\n&gt; agi I do believe. Anyhow....here&#39;s my question...can I make it in<br/>\n&gt; Befallen at level 20 ok? I&#39;m scared from what I read to attempt it.<br/>\n&gt; Apparently everything aggros terribly. EQAtlas says level 7-25+ mobs,<br/>\n&gt; but since they are all necros and thermagists, the damages are much<br/>\n&gt; worse than they con. I HATE dying, and I&#39;m too chicken to attempt<br/>\n&gt; without some feedback. Any suggestions or stories?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; Cahlia<br/>\n&gt; 19th Season,Wood Elf Druid of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Morrel Thule Server<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Fates of Destiny&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
