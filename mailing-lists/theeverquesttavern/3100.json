I think that would <br/>\n&gt;be really neat. We could meet one day a week on these characters, that way <br/>\n&gt;we can play our others too. I know some of you already have 5 characters. <br/>\n&gt;But you can delete to make a new character. I have done that to move to <br/>\n&gt;different server. Now i only have 2 charcaters, so ie easy for me to go to <br/>\n&gt;different server to make a new character. I thought this would be a neat <br/>\n&gt;idea, kinda like a club thing.... Well, let me know you guys what you think <br/>\n&gt;and we can decide if we would like to try this.      Surreal<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hmmi would say first to go to www.eqdruids.com if you dont already<br/>\n&gt;know about it. It is a terrific druid only site. In the messages<br/>\n&gt;boards they have sticky post about where to hunt at your general lvl.<br/>\n&gt;Not for sure but at 41 i think i was quadding snow cougers in ice<br/>\n&gt;clad or maybe the specs in oasis. After them i went to timoruos deep<br/>\n&gt;and started quadding spirocs. That took me to all the way to 51 xp<br/>\n&gt;slows down at about 50 51 on the spirocs but i know can take you to<br/>\n&gt;52 as i am about to ding it there. Or you can start trying the<br/>\n&gt;raptors in that same zone also. I havent tried them yet but read that<br/>\n&gt;it can be done. If you want to make some money and xp head to cobalt<br/>\n&gt;scar and quad the wyverns. Save the pelts and sell them in bazaar and<br/>\n&gt;sell the gems to vendors for about 40plat. This is a bit more<br/>\n&gt;dangerous and harder as there is always people there farming. Unless<br/>\n&gt;you have killed alot of giants in velious and raised your claws of<br/>\n&gt;veeshan<br/>\n&gt;faction you will be kos to the drakes there and they cast on you for<br/>\n&gt;like 300 dam. Do not pull the named wyvern he cannot be slowed or<br/>\n&gt;snared. As far as the wis items i just went to bazaar and filled in<br/>\n&gt;the filters one of them you can pick wis and all wis items will come<br/>\n&gt;up then just shop away. It will be slow quadding till you get your<br/>\n&gt;new aoe spell lightnig blast and lvl 45 when you can get kei then its<br/>\n&gt;smooth sailing to 51. Oh there is a good quest wis book you can hold<br/>\n&gt;in your off hand adss like 10 wis and somethin other would be easy to<br/>\n&gt;obtain at you lvl. Sorry but i forgot the name of it next time im on<br/>\n&gt;ill check but can prolly find it on the druid site.<br/>\n&gt;--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theeverquesttavern@yahoogroups.com\">theeverquesttavern@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sue &lt;kstiggermom@y...&gt;<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ** sigh **<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess I&#39;m the loner.
