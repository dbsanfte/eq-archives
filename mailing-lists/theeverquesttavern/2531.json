I&#39;ll add my<br/>\n2cp worth here...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1ST-- play a race/class<br/>\ncombo that you like, and not just for stats. You will<br/>\nmake friends and be remembered if you are not just<br/>\nanother run of the mill barbarian warrior or halfling<br/>\ndruid. One thing people don&#39;t understand is that you<br/>\nhave to like your char or you&#39;ll get bored with it and<br/>\nthen you&#39;ve wasted all that time...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, Ogre<br/>\nWarriors, Erudite Chanters and Halfling Druids are the best<br/>\ncombos Stat wise. I&#39;m not saying that any of them are<br/>\nbad either-- Erudites start in a horrible newbie zone<br/>\n(unless you go to painell/warrens), Ogres do too and have<br/>\nfaction problems. No complaints about 1/2ling druids at<br/>\nall, except that you need to get out of Misty Thicket<br/>\nASAP if you want to make any cash and get into groups<br/>\nat a young age. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go to Castersrealm.com for<br/>\nsome help on class/race issues and suggestions on<br/>\nwhere to put points. They are not always right, IMO,<br/>\nbut they are helpful. Chanter INT 1st, CHA 2nd. Druid<br/>\nWIS 1st and then maybe CHA (if you want to charm<br/>\nanimals a lot) or any melee stat. Warrior, depends on<br/>\nwhat race you pick-- remember though, increased AGI<br/>\ntranslates into AC, which means less hits and damage taken,<br/>\nwhich means less need for healing, which means less<br/>\nchance for clerics getting agro... etc etc... (Also, I<br/>\nthought only Ogre Warriors had the &quot;not stun from the<br/>\nfront&quot; benefit??). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some fun combos of my<br/>\nchars:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iksar Necro&lt;br&gt;DE Chanter&lt;br&gt;Wood Elf Druid&lt;br&gt;Dwarf<br/>\nRogue&lt;br&gt;Gnome Mage&lt;br&gt;Vah Shir Bard&lt;br&gt;Troll<br/>\nBeastlord&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have fun with it-- be smart on where you put your<br/>\npoints and work toward stat increasing armor and any<br/>\nclass/race combo can be fun!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
