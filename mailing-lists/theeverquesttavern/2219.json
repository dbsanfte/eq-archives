I couldn&#39;t even see how<br/>\nfar back I had to go to see what was new.<br/>\nLOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glad to see the boards are doing well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)<br/>\nBlech. Yeah. Girls seem to get a lot. I assume this is<br/>\ncoming out of my discussion of my poor druid being asked<br/>\nif he was about to be trashed-- from the level 35<br/>\nfemale Elven character whose friends had given her<br/>\nenough equip to have 198 wisdom. LOL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes. Women<br/>\nget a lot of free things. Still will always play male<br/>\nthough. Otherwise, I couldn&#39;t entertain and tease<br/>\nmercilessly those poor females. Especially the one&#39;s with<br/>\nbeards or trolls with the last name of Dancing. Grin.<br/>\nYes Gert and Kas. That would be you if you read these<br/>\nboards. Grin. Probably not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Anyhoo, My<br/>\nguildmates and EQ in general seems to be obsessed with<br/>\nitems. And yes, it can give you long term sustaining<br/>\npower that will help you kite or clear out a ton of<br/>\nmonsters. But I&#39;ve noticed something else. Downtime, I have<br/>\na quicker turn around b/c I have less mana to med<br/>\nup to. I&#39;ve never really kited, and always group for<br/>\neverything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I sit and am FOM a lot more often than<br/>\nmy partymates. Which to me makes me wonder. If<br/>\nusually the pullers are pulling when other casters are at<br/>\n60 to 80, and I&#39;m at 100.. what&#39;s the point of<br/>\nhaving that extra stuff as a caster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Admittedly,<br/>\nas a mellee-type the boats completely different, but<br/>\nI spend my money on spells and tradeskills. Never<br/>\nhave much for equipment. Have bought about 800pp in<br/>\nequipment over the last year though. But compared to<br/>\ntradeskills and spells combined... last level I spent 270<br/>\nplat easy (lvl 39 spells rock though).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;dang,<br/>\nsorry to go so long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out... be well<br/>\nall&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic of the Drinal server&lt;br&gt;Officer in<br/>\nTribunal of the Antiquities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... had a<br/>\nconversation-- only works once in group chat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asking<br/>\nabout loot distribution and who has what...<br/>\noccasionally they ask, &quot;what does everyone have now?&quot; This<br/>\nworks best in CC when everyone&#39;s splitting equal stacks<br/>\nof Crystalline silk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just answer them,<br/>\n&quot;Potato&quot; or &quot;Vermouth&quot; or what not. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yes.
