Yes this is a great thought for getting through<br/>\nthe earlier lvls but.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reasons why this is<br/>\nbad:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1: If it is ur first char. then you really dont<br/>\nlearn how to play him. Youn need to learn how to<br/>\nsurvive and learn your limits of what you can and cant<br/>\ndo.(also if its you ve never played the class before id<br/>\nalso recomend playing Vs pwr lvling)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2: I was<br/>\ngrouped with a guy at the treants, i pull and go in and<br/>\nall i see is fizzle, fizzle, fizzle, fizzle.......<br/>\n50%of his mana burned in fizzles before he got the<br/>\nspell off and put alot more of a burden on me. The<br/>\nplayers ive seen so far that have lvld this way, you can<br/>\ntell. They suck at thier skills(unless theve taken out<br/>\nALOT of time just to work on them)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess all<br/>\nim saying is at later lvls you dont want to put<br/>\nother players at risk cause of lack of experience. Yes<br/>\nsure everyone hates being a newbie and wants to get<br/>\nout of that stage ASAP but it is there for a reason:<br/>\nto help you learn your char. and how to play<br/>\nthem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am only level 25 but i got thier by my self and i<br/>\nfeel that is an accomplishment. I am just trying to<br/>\ninform people of the consiquences of the &quot;easy way.&quot; I<br/>\nhope that as i reach the later levels that i will see<br/>\nthis less and less. I m trying to bitch but their will<br/>\nprobaly be a lot of u who read this that will take it<br/>\nlike that but oh well.
