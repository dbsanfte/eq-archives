If it&#39;s your first time playing<br/>\nI recomend a warrior, just to get used to the<br/>\ngame.&lt;br&gt;Warriors are pretty much the simplest class, and probably<br/>\nthe easiest to play in the early levels.&lt;br&gt;After you<br/>\nget more familiar with the game and how combat works,<br/>\nyou can switch to another class.&lt;br&gt;As for race,<br/>\nBarbarians make good warriors, and their town&#39;s pretty<br/>\nsimple, but they&#39;re kind of hard to get started with as<br/>\nfar as their hunting grounds go. Unless you use the<br/>\nright strategy, you&#39;ll die a lot before making level<br/>\n2.&lt;br&gt;Freeport has 2 good starting areas, but the lag&#39;s<br/>\nintolerable. So I recomend starting in Qeynos. The lag&#39;s not<br/>\ntoo bad, and there&#39;s plenty of good hunting from<br/>\nlevel 1-3.&lt;br&gt;Oh, and have your friend show you how to<br/>\nhotkey your attacks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
