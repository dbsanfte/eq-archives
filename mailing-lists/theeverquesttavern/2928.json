It&#39;s been a bit of time since I last posted. Sorry for <br/>\n    that. Between school and works (yes that&#39;s three jobs in that works) <br/>\n    I have been a very busy person. But I have managed to squeeze in <br/>\n    some precious EQ time, so I am happy. Now my question is this. I am <br/>\n    presently lvl 32. I am a tick and a half away from 33 so in my mind <br/>\n    that&#39;s close enough to 34 for me. (LOL Math was never my best <br/>\n    subject as you can tell.) Anyway. I am currently in High Keep <br/>\n    getting my lvl&#39;s and as soon as I get 34 I am so out of there. The <br/>\n    only problem is...where? I have considered Sol A, but I don&#39;t know <br/>\n    if I want to go there if it is crowded or if it is empty. (What with <br/>\n    all the expansions and all.) So where to go at lvl 34 for an <br/>\n    Enchanter? Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Raven<br/>\n<br/>\n    AKA Leria E&#39;ci Server <br/>\n    AKA Tleya E&#39;ci Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theeverquesttavern-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">theeverquesttavern-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Your use of Yahoo!
