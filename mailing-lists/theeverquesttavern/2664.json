Yet, they can <br/>\nsee your character, and soon they reappear. <br/>\nI have seen one extreme case where the pc was blinking in and out. It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t just myself who was experiencing this phenomena at the time, <br/>\nbut three other players were also having the same thing happen when <br/>\nthey attempted to see that one PC. <br/>\nWhen it was reported to the bug screen, the GM had the audacity to <br/>\nsay that the character was Invisible. As my main is a level 47 druid, <br/>\nI think I know when peeps are camo&#39;d or such. Not to mention it&#39;s <br/>\nhappened while I was grouped with my husband&#39;s character and was able <br/>\nto turn around and look at his monitor...easy enough to speak to him <br/>\ntwo feet away to KNOW he&#39;s not camo. <br/>\nI was curious as to whether or not the experience is exclusive to <br/>\nQuellious or if people on other servers have the same thing happen. <br/>\nBelieve me, this is not a good thing in certain situations. <br/>\nEspecially if you&#39;re not grouped and need to see the other person. <br/>\n(i.e. trade).<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nJessica<br/>\n<br/>\nEternalRuby <br/>\nDruid of Karana<br/>\nQuellious</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
