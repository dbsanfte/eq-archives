I&#39;m a computer<br/>\ngeek, I love the computer, I try to stay on as long as<br/>\nI can, ya know, last week I was sooooooooooo<br/>\nrestless, staying up &#39;till 11:00 at night, just bulding<br/>\nstuff with legos, I&#39;ve already chosen which races I<br/>\nprobaly want to be (Halfling, DarkElf, HighElf) I know<br/>\nyou can have 8. And I&#39;ve chosen the names for them<br/>\n(Petit, Dimness, Xyla) I even built little lego statues<br/>\nof them, lol, so I really have gone completely mad<br/>\nabout everquest, Ever since it came out I&#39;ve wanted it,<br/>\nI promised my mom & dad that I will pay for the<br/>\nmonthly fees (atleast the first one is FREE) which is<br/>\n9.89 per month? which I get 20.00 a month from my<br/>\nchores :) and so I&#39;m just sitting here... In front of my<br/>\ncomputer, Programming, Chatting,<br/>\nwhatever.&lt;br&gt;:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--Destino88</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
