If you decide to<br/>\nsee what is in Kunark...you should be just fine in<br/>\nOverthere. If you take the raft from Oasis to Timorous Deep,<br/>\nit will take you to an island (Ogre Isle is what we<br/>\nalways called it.) You may need to camo up, but since<br/>\nyou are a druid, there&#39;s no problem there. Get off<br/>\nthe raft and go right...stay close to the rock wall,<br/>\nbut evade any ogres. You&#39;ll see the shore on the<br/>\nother side of the rock...go to the dock area nearest to<br/>\nthe rock. A large boat will come here- I don&#39;t recall<br/>\nthe name, sorry. Get on the large boat and this will<br/>\nzone you into Overthere. Turn your clip plane up so<br/>\nyou can see details far away. If you stand on the<br/>\nleft side of the boat, you will soon see a large wall<br/>\nin the distance. Since Overthere is an evil outpost,<br/>\nyou will need to jump off the boat as you get closer<br/>\nto the wall. DON&#39;T GO TO THE DOCK! You will die- if<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t evil that is. If your swimming is poor I<br/>\nsuggest bringing fish scales for enduring breath (but<br/>\nit&#39;s really not a far swim.) Once you can see the<br/>\nwall, swim to the edge of it...the left side as you<br/>\nlook at it from the boat. You will notice that it juts<br/>\nout of the land...there is land on both sides. Ok,<br/>\nthis is important. On the right of the wall- nearest<br/>\nthe boat and dock....there is a hill, a small open<br/>\narea. This is a bind point. It is the only place where<br/>\nyou can bind. Do so, it will make it a shorter trip<br/>\nif you die. Kunark zones are quite large and there<br/>\nis enough area to cover running without having to<br/>\nride the boat too for a CR. Now that you are bound,<br/>\nswim to the other side of the wall. As a druid, there<br/>\nis a lot of open space here...good kiting grounds.<br/>\nBut beware, there are areas with higher level Sarnaks<br/>\nthat will slap you silly. Check maps online that list<br/>\nmobs and locs so that you can get a gist of the zone.<br/>\nThere is a large cliff there...Don&#39;t fall off as you&#39;re<br/>\ntrying to auto run and hold a converstion. That could be<br/>\nvery messy. Find the loc of the Warslik woods zone.<br/>\nThere is a huge statue near the zone that is a great<br/>\nlandmark and makes for a great pulling area. If you can<br/>\nget a group together...this is a good spot and it is<br/>\nnear the zone in case things get hectic. For the way<br/>\nhome- for your ranger friend since he/she can&#39;t gate<br/>\nand you are a ways from your group ports, bring a<br/>\nstack of bat wings so that you have them handy for<br/>\nlevitate. Just head back to the bind area and wait til you<br/>\nsee the boat...get everyone that is heading home a<br/>\nlev and it is MUCH easier to get on the boat. If you<br/>\nhave to swim it can be difficult to keep up with the<br/>\nboat or figure out how to climb up the barrels to get<br/>\non. With lev, you just walk right on it. This time,<br/>\nstay on the right side of the boat (away from the KOS<br/>\ndocks of course.) Sit and rest til you get to Ogre<br/>\nisland and just back track back to the other side of the<br/>\nrock to where the raft comes (there is no marker, but<br/>\nit is kinda by a palm tree.) Then that takes you<br/>\nhome to Oasis. Good luck and I hope this helps. I know<br/>\nit wrote a lot, but I remember how nervous I was the<br/>\nfirst time I made this trip and I was trying to get<br/>\ninstructions in game. It can be quite confusing and is a lot<br/>\nto remember.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
