On the blue cons, lemme think<br/>\n. . . they were goblins (warriors or just plain<br/>\nones), and before I think they conned white. So maybe<br/>\nI&#39;m even with them or something, now that I went up<br/>\nto a level. Unfortunately, you pull one of those<br/>\nthings, you pull three, apparently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tongues<br/>\nare for a quest item that only the small sneaky ones<br/>\nwith beards can use . . . you get the Mining Pick, but<br/>\nthere&#39;s a fourth tongue that I have to get by offing a<br/>\ntraitorous Dwarf in Crushbone. That should be an<br/>\nadventure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One other thing that I just thought of -- do Orc<br/>\nOracles see through a Rogue&#39;s Hide/Sneak? I was poking<br/>\naround the stone column in Butcherblock, surrounded by<br/>\ntwo Cents and an Oracle, when all of a sudden they<br/>\nspied me and stomped me. I may have hit some key the<br/>\nbetrayed me, but I don&#39;t think so. Let&#39;s hear it for<br/>\n/corpse!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
