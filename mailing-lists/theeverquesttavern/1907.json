The drawback to<br/>\nIksars is that you are a hated race...so banking<br/>\nanywhere but Kunark and Velious is incredibly<br/>\ntough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find that iksars are kinda of a boring race when<br/>\nyoung in that you don&#39;t see any other races fighting<br/>\nalong side of you. Once you approach level 16ish,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll fight in Lake of Ill Omen, and then you&#39;ll see<br/>\nother races. Get used to staring at other lizards until<br/>\nthen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t worry about your first character...you probably<br/>\nwon&#39;t keep him/her after you&#39;ve gotten the jist of the<br/>\ngame. And READ, READ, READ out at eq.castersrealm.com.<br/>\nThat&#39;s a great resource.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CoJim, Druid of the 26th<br/>\ncircle&lt;br&gt;Shaojiku, Iksar Monk of the 12th trial&lt;br&gt;Prexus server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
