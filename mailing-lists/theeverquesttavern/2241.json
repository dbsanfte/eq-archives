I have a Compaq for a old computer and I think<br/>\nyour prob might be your video card. From what I have<br/>\nseen compaq gives the worst cards with there computers<br/>\nand you cant upgrade them. Or you can upgrade them<br/>\nbut not alot I still have a new TnT 2 card in the box<br/>\nthat would not go into my compaq. And your computer<br/>\ncan run Ultima Online fine because that game doesnt<br/>\nrequire much to play. I used to play UO for a really<br/>\nshort time but never got into it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The group<br/>\nthing is another person asking you to group with them.<br/>\nTo join the group click on main and then push follow<br/>\nor you can hit disband which will reject the offer<br/>\nto join the group. Also if you want to start a group<br/>\ntarget the person you want in group and push<br/>\ninvite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this somewhat helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;omm</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
