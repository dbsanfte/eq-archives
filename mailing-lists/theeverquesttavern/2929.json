It&#39;s been a bit of time since I last posted. Sorry for <br/>\n  &gt;   that. Between school and works (yes that&#39;s three jobs in that <br/>\n  works) <br/>\n  &gt;   I have been a very busy person. But I have managed to squeeze in <br/>\n  &gt;   some precious EQ time, so I am happy. Now my question is this. I <br/>\n  am <br/>\n  &gt;   presently lvl 32. I am a tick and a half away from 33 so in my <br/>\n  mind <br/>\n  &gt;   that&#39;s close enough to 34 for me. (LOL Math was never my best <br/>\n  &gt;   subject as you can tell.) Anyway. I am currently in High Keep <br/>\n  &gt;   getting my lvl&#39;s and as soon as I get 34 I am so out of there. <br/>\n  The <br/>\n  &gt;   only problem is...where? I have considered Sol A, but I don&#39;t <br/>\n  know <br/>\n  &gt;   if I want to go there if it is crowded or if it is empty. (What <br/>\n  with <br/>\n  &gt;   all the expansions and all.) So where to go at lvl 34 for an <br/>\n  &gt;   Enchanter? Any suggestions?<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   Raven<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   AKA Leria E&#39;ci Server <br/>\n  &gt;   AKA Tleya E&#39;ci Server<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  &gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theeverquesttavern-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">theeverquesttavern-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
