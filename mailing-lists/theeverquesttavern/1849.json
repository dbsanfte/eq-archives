I have found that by simply telling them of their<br/>\noffense is enough to correct it...at least for the time<br/>\nbeing. If not, then /ignore seems to do the trick<br/>\n;-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally I love to help others...specially newbies.<br/>\nNothing makes me smile more than to convert the 10<br/>\nPristine Scarab Carapice&#39;s that I drug over from Unrest<br/>\ninto Scarab Breastplates then to /shout a free<br/>\ngiveaway to first 10 noobs to poke me. Then just sit back<br/>\nand watch all the little people come-a-runnin :-) I<br/>\ncant tell you how many times those people have done<br/>\nnice things for me in return...out of the blue,<br/>\nbecause they remembered my actions...be it healing me in<br/>\na time of need...giving me a nice piece of<br/>\nequip...providing services...etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess my point is that<br/>\nmost people want to interact in a positive way and<br/>\nhave fun...just like we do. Many times they do not<br/>\nrealize that they are being rude or discourteous by their<br/>\naction or inaction. So it is up to us to point it out to<br/>\nthem. If they continue their rudeness then there are<br/>\nother things you can do...most obvious being..to ignore<br/>\nand not deal with them in the future. In my own<br/>\ndefense...I never assume that a port or a SoW is free (unless<br/>\ngrouped) and always offer to pay. More times than not,<br/>\npayment is refused and we go on our merry way, both<br/>\nfeeling good. With the other time...it was money well<br/>\nspent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If any of you play on Bertoxx, send me a<br/>\ntell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quynnelleon&lt;br&gt;Ranger of Tunare for 22 Seasons</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
