I can&#39;t believe<br/>\nyou&#39;re here. Too cool. Haven&#39;t seen you in a while - my<br/>\nEQ time is erratic, what with college getting in the<br/>\nway :). I just got to lv 12 tonight, hunted the gnoll<br/>\ncommander/elite gnoll room in BB with some capable if not greedy<br/>\nfriends. I got some rad equipment - I&#39;m in full banded<br/>\nnow. Also, this one really cool necromancer, Gixon,<br/>\nwho&#39;s probably at lv 50 by now, hooked me up. He gave<br/>\nme a fine steel two-handed sword, which I&#39;m using<br/>\nnow. He also gave me a bronze helm and a Qeynos kite<br/>\nshield and gave me about 100 pp, all for just some bone<br/>\nchips. He is too cool. Anyway, long time no see -<br/>\nperhaps we shall run into each other<br/>\nagain!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Half-elf warrior of 12 seasons&lt;br&gt;Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
