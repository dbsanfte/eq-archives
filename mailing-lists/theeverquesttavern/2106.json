If the necro is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2125639450\">Alright, your flaw here is saying that &quot;SK with<br/>\nsuper high resist gear&quot;. That means he&#39;s got good equip<br/>\nwithout assuming the same of the Necro. If the necro is<br/>\nwell equipped he can negate that factor. You&#39;d be<br/>\nsurprised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep in mind a necro is versatile. He can be a mana<br/>\nbattery, a nuker, and even a tank. If you read about that<br/>\nnew belt that gives casters haste, you will find a<br/>\nnecro detailing how he tanks... and the healers save a<br/>\nlot of mana b/c of his tanking. His spells mob manage<br/>\nand saves mana for clerics, and nukers. Necros are<br/>\nthe masters of party mana management in higher levels<br/>\n(excluding mana regen that is). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s some weird<br/>\ncombo of his spells, his 3 life taps cycling, an FBSS<br/>\nand some other stuff. I&#39;m not even sure he uses his<br/>\nskel. And if you&#39;ve ever had a druid or shaman in a<br/>\ngroup with a necro that knows what his doing, have them<br/>\nRegen or Chloro the necro. Let&#39;s just say it helps a<br/>\nlot. Chloro is like Clarity 2 to a Necro. =)I won&#39;t<br/>\nplay one and know little about Necros other than the<br/>\nfact that I do research so I know what I group with...<br/>\nbut... Many necros never group. It&#39;s not that they<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t make good groups, but they can solo yellows from<br/>\nearly on all the way to like 50+. Druids that are well<br/>\nset can Octakite, but they can&#39;t dispatch a yellow as<br/>\neasily as a Necro can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS...<br/>\nalso didn&#39;t say that an SK couldn&#39;t win on any given<br/>\nday. But it&#39;d have to be a good SK, and very well<br/>\nequipped as well as know how to take down a Necro. It&#39;s a<br/>\nvery specific knowledge. Different classes take<br/>\ndifferent methods to take down. It&#39;s not just a matter of<br/>\nhigh resistances. It&#39;s knowing when to pumice, how to<br/>\ntarget using all hotkeys when nothing shows up on the<br/>\nscreen and how to break fear or what to do when feared.<br/>\nEtc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree that skill and items you have<br/>\nplay a large part of it. I even mentioned the Warrior<br/>\nstreak and winner of that last EQ PVP competition. But<br/>\ntypically, there&#39;s an expectation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
