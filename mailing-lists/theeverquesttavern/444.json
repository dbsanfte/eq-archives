When you&#39;re a coule of levels<br/>\nhigher you can take on gnolls and trade their fangs for<br/>\nmoonstones, and then trade the moonstones for blackburrow<br/>\nstout. You can get pretty good money and exp from doing<br/>\nthat. Check out the quests on everlore for the full<br/>\ndetails, names etc. Around level 8 its a good idea to hop<br/>\non the boat and go to kerra isle. Everything gives<br/>\ngood exp and you can get some nice loot like giant<br/>\nsnake fangs and lightstones, you&#39;d need a magic weapon<br/>\nto hit the wisps however. Theres a really nice quest<br/>\nwhere you save up your greater lightstones and trade<br/>\nthem to a gypsy in Norht karana for a tome which you<br/>\ncan sell for about 8pp. Hope this helps you out a bit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
