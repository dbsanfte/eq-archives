Anyone can learn<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; become one,&quot; he <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; added. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Practitioners of witchcraft focus on the good in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; life and the spirit, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and reject any connection with the devil,<br/>\n&gt; Starchel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since their beliefs date back to ancient times<br/>\n&gt; &gt; well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before the birth <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Jesus, witchcraft has no bond with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Christian<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; embodiment of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evil. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Witchcraft has got absolutely nothing to do<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the folklore image <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of evil witches with green faces and warts on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nose. It&#39;s about <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; becoming a rounded person who lives in harmony<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nature,&quot; said the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; goatee-bearded druid. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NO HOCUS-POCUS NOR HUNKUM BUNKUM <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The headmaster stressed that his school,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; established<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in 1998 for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wannabe witches and druids of 18 years and<br/>\n&gt; above,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has no ties with <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; religious organisations nor follows any esoteric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; movement. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The syllabus originally lasted three years but<br/>\n&gt; has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; now been revised <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to a more flexible form to suit students&#39; busy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; schedules. In a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sign of the times, it teaches courses over the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Internet as most of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; its students live outside Austria. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A student graduates with a venefica or veneficus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (from the Latin for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; witch/druid) certificate after passing written<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exams<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in seven modules <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and submitting a final thesis. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The first module focuses on awakening intuition,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specifically on how <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to find sources of energy in nature and how to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; channel it. Other <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; modules are astronomy, astrology, botany,<br/>\n&gt; holistic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; healing and ritual <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; magic. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Curriculum information on the school website<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; www.hexen-schule.de <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shows there are no modules like the Defence<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Against<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Dark Arts <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; class which Harry Potter had to take in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hogwarts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; School of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Some wannabe witches and druids are turned off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enrolling with us <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when we tell them that our aim is to demystify<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; witchcraft,&quot; said <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Starchel, who is an information technology<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specialist by profession. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;People do approach us hoping to learn how to<br/>\n&gt; fly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a broomstick. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then we have to disappoint them and explain that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s much more <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important to let the spirit fly -- to be able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; combine intellect <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the soul.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The school has received a huge fillip from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Harry<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Potter books by <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; J.K. Rowling (news - web sites) and television<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; series such as Sabrina <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Teenage Witch. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We actually had kids phoning up asking whether<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could ditch <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their school and enrol with us,&quot; Starchel said. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>=== message truncated ===<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
