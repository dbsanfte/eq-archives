One day I was wandering around these sand dunes looking for someone give me some cash*laugh*and I saw 10 players all","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1692192288\">Here&#39;s a really good story! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day I was<br/>\nwandering around these sand dunes looking for someone give<br/>\nme some cash*laugh*and I saw 10 players all sitting<br/>\nat the docks casting spells on each other.Since I<br/>\nwas a Warrior I usually acceoted any spell,so I<br/>\nrushed over and asked them to cast some spells on me and<br/>\nperhaps give me some gold.What luck! 6 of them were level<br/>\n46 paladins and the rest were thinking of a way to<br/>\nget rid of something so they would not be<br/>\nencumbered.I got 134 platinum and since I was a newbie at the<br/>\ntime they cast 4 different spells on me even though I<br/>\nhad no idea what they did I was glad to get them! As<br/>\nI ran away to the nearest merchant I turned around<br/>\nto wave at people who had so graciously given me the<br/>\nmoney I saw a big thing that was yellow coming over the<br/>\nhills. I clicked on it and it said it was a sand giant!<br/>\nI yelled at all the players at the docks to jump<br/>\ninto the water because there was a sand giant.They all<br/>\ndid so except 2 who had could only speak<br/>\nFrench(really!)coming from Canada I tried to think of how to say it as<br/>\nthe giant got closer and closer to the pair. the<br/>\ngiant was meters away so my level 1 Dark Elf ran to the<br/>\ndock and jumped in the water to show what the others<br/>\nwere doing.The two Wood Elves typed in several<br/>\nquestion marks and I gave up. I ran back to the hill and<br/>\ncould only watch as they sat back down and continued<br/>\nresting.the sand giant came up behind one and killed her in 3<br/>\nhits before she could even react and he chased the<br/>\nother female for 1 minute or so since I was following<br/>\nthe chase to see what would happen and just as she<br/>\nwas going to reach a guard all her stamina ran out I<br/>\ncan only guess because she stopped jumping and he<br/>\ncaugfhr her and killed her as well.I ran back to the<br/>\ndocks and was thanked by the low level players for<br/>\nsaving them and given some more weapons and spells.I sat<br/>\nwith them for 5 minutes and then I saw the 2 Wood<br/>\nElves coming over the dunes to collect their<br/>\nbodies.They cmae to where I was and started getting real mad<br/>\nat me! They followed me arounf the whole desert for<br/>\nan hour asking me in french to not be a coward and<br/>\nduel them.I finally took the easy way out and circled<br/>\naround a tree and used the hide command.I stayed still<br/>\nfor 10 minutes as they searched and searched for<br/>\nme.Finally,they gave up and ran as fast as I could to another<br/>\nzone!the moral of this story is:DON&#39;T GET<br/>\nINVOLVED!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. If you ever come across Sadum and Ziya tell them<br/>\nthat Vanelen(me)tried:)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
