I thought it was sweet and heart warming. <br/>\n<br/>\nSAFETY<br/>\nMore U.S. Dads Balance Laptops, Kids on Laps<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Julie Shields - WeNews correspondent<br/>\n<br/>\n(WOMENSENEWS)--Now is the perfect time to go back to the roots of <br/>\nFather&#39;s Day in the United States and celebrate and support what is <br/>\ncalled &quot;involved fatherhood.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFew know that Father&#39;s Day in this country arose out of a daughter&#39;s <br/>\ndesire to honor her father, a widowed single Dad who raised six <br/>\nchildren--including a - newborn--on a Spokane, Wash., farm. Sonora <br/>\nSmart Dodd, so the story goes, heard a Mother&#39;s Day sermon in 1909 <br/>\nand wondered why fathers like hers were not similarly celebrated. In <br/>\n1910, Dodd organized the first such celebration in Spokane on June <br/>\n19, a date she chose because her father was born in June. Dodd <br/>\nbelieved her father courageous and strong because he made sacrifices <br/>\nand behaved selflessly while she and her siblings grew up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1924, President Calvin Coolidge advocated for a national father&#39;s <br/>\nday to help establish better relations between fathers and children <br/>\nand to remind fathers of their responsibilities. In 1966, Lyndon <br/>\nJohnson proclaimed the third Sunday in June a national holiday, <br/>\nmaking it official.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Father&#39;s Day, we should support fathers who have followed in the <br/>\nfootsteps of William Jackson Smart, Dodd&#39;s father. We sit on top of <br/>\nwhat could be a watershed moment in fatherhood. All kinds of evidence <br/>\ndocument a zeitgeist shift for modern fathers. The recession and <br/>\naltered views about men, women and work bring us to a point where <br/>\nreal economic and family change can occur--and has occurred--quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information:<br/>\n<br/>\nFamilies and Work Institute--The Fatherhood Project: - <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fatherhoodproject.org\">http://www.fatherhoodproject.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHow to Avoid the Mommy Trap: A Roadmap for Sharing Parenting - and <br/>\nMaking it Work: - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mommytrap.com\">http://www.mommytrap.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n._.-~*~-.Beverly R.-~*~-._.-~*~-._<br/>\n <br/>\nP.O.
