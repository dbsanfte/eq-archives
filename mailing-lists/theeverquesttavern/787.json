Stats are DMG 4 DLY 23 WT 5.0 Class: War Shd Rng<br/>\nBrd Rog Race:all. These stats are better then a<br/>\nbronze rapier and it is less expansive! A bronze Rapier<br/>\nfrom a vendor goes for around 5pp. Also the Cast-iron<br/>\nRapier looks like a sword when equiped (like the rusty<br/>\nones). Who can tell me more about this weapon and where<br/>\nit is found? It&#39;s a great weapon for my newby bard<br/>\n(now lvl 3 nearly 4). I thought it might be a summoned<br/>\nweapon because it sounded to good to be through, but it<br/>\nwould not be at a vendor then also I logged out and<br/>\nback on and to my joy it was still on my char. So<br/>\nplease if anyone knows more on this weapon tell<br/>\nme!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alrix,&lt;br&gt;Very Happy Bard of 3 seasons,&lt;br&gt;Beroxxulous.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
