And looking at EQ&#39;s support<br/>\n&gt; page will not tell <br/>\n&gt; you the correct fix for it. They claim that you<br/>\n&gt; should download a new <br/>\n&gt; EverQuest.exe file and run it. This will not fix the<br/>\n&gt; issue. If you <br/>\n&gt; read further on the page, they briefly talk about<br/>\n&gt; the patcher not <br/>\n&gt; working correctly if Internet Explorer is not<br/>\n&gt; installed on your pc. <br/>\n&gt; They FAIL to mention that you need to be running IE<br/>\n&gt; 5.5 or better for <br/>\n&gt; it to work at all. I was running 5.0 and it would<br/>\n&gt; not connect to the <br/>\n&gt; patcher. I downloaded and installed 5.5, rebooted,<br/>\n&gt; and WHAM!
