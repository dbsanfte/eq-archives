There are quite a few genuinely good players out<br/>\nthere who remember how hard it was to start out and<br/>\ntherefore give things to non-twinked noobs. I like to give<br/>\nstuff away unless I&#39;m desperate for plat...I hate<br/>\ntrying to sell stuff. For example, most of the bronze<br/>\narmor I get in Sol B and the velium weapons I get in<br/>\nvelious I don&#39;t even bother selling, I plant the stuff on<br/>\nrats and snakes and stuff in WFP. (Hmmm...how could a<br/>\nsnake wear a bronze breastplate?) I figure it&#39;s a nice<br/>\nsurprise for a noob. Also just about every time I go to<br/>\nFreeport I buy a couple backpacks and hand them out to<br/>\nnon-twinks. Remember what a pain it was to only have a few<br/>\ninventory slots for those rat whiskers and snake<br/>\neggs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will admit, all my characters are twinks. My boss<br/>\nbought my first character almost a full set of banded.<br/>\nWhen I created my bard I passed that on to her as well<br/>\nas the whopping 30pp my warrior had on her BUT I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t wear the banded till lvl 5, i just got her full<br/>\nleather cuz I felt banded was too much of an unfair<br/>\nadvantage. I&#39;ve lightened up since. That banded eventually<br/>\nwent to my shadow knight and then when she upgraded it<br/>\nwent on the rats and snakes in WFP. :o) Now that my<br/>\nbard is much higher in level she can afford nicer<br/>\nstuff for my alts and sure it makes life easier on<br/>\nthem. But I didn&#39;t start out at lvl 1 with a full suit<br/>\nof FP. And sure, sometimes it irritates me a bit to<br/>\nsee a lvl 9 bard in full lambent (or singing steel!)<br/>\nwhen I had to work so damn hard to get mine...but it&#39;s<br/>\na game and you&#39;re supposed to have fun. I had fun<br/>\ndoing the lambent quests...but if a person would rather<br/>\nbuy their quest armor because that is what it takes<br/>\nto have fun...then more power to &#39;em. To each their<br/>\nown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funnily enough, DAoC has made me some serious plat.<br/>\nSeveral friends have quit EQ to play it and have given me<br/>\ntheir stuff. The stuff I got from them is what I used<br/>\nto twink my other characters and whatever they<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t use I sold or often just gave away. But some of<br/>\nthe better stuff I sold and now have 2kpp in the<br/>\nbank...the most I have ever had at one time. (That probably<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t sound like much to some of you but it&#39;s quite a<br/>\nbit to me). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottom line is, if ya wanna<br/>\ntwink, go for it. If you don&#39;t, don&#39;t. You&#39;re PAYING for<br/>\nthe game so you have the right to enjoy it whether it<br/>\nbe as a twink or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Mystii Shadowsoul&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nLvl 48 Bardess</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
