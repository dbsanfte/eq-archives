Remember you will <br/>\nlose any screeensavers,etc...you have in your Windows files. And <br/>\nanything you have saved on the desktop. Be sure and do your backups <br/>\nand good luck...:&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, depends. Installing Windows over itself can work but it <br/>\ndepends on what Windows version you&#39;ve got.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t do it except as a last resort in Windows 98. Can&#39;t be 95 <br/>\nor below cause EQ doesn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nXP and ME are better bets for install over itself but you have to <br/>\nworry about like driver, system file stuff... etc. But supposedly <br/>\nthere&#39;s a lot fewer problems with that. I&#39;ve just never tried it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s all sorts of stuff you can do to try to pull the system back <br/>\nup-- but most rely on being able to get into safe mode...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s system restore, msconfig stuff, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you can try the old scanreg /restore in dos trick but that&#39;s <br/>\nharder to do in ME. I can&#39;t remember the exact trick. *pouts* It is <br/>\npossible though I&#39;ve heard a lot say it no longer is in ME and XP. <br/>\n*shrugs* I am not 100% positive for XP but know ME does have a way <br/>\nfor sure and am fairly sure though more along 65% type of sure...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well.
