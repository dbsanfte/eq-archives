At lvl 33, I have a bunch of items that<br/>\nI worked hard for (including the Testament of<br/>\nVanear, which can&#39;t be used to twink!!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think<br/>\nnon-twinks work harder and become better players because<br/>\nthings aren&#39;t handed to them easily. Especially druids--<br/>\nlower level twinked druids can melee anything up to a<br/>\ncertain level, and then they&#39;re screwed because they<br/>\nhaven&#39;t perfected druid strategyies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At lvl 16,<br/>\ndon&#39;t be discouraged. I think i was decked out in all<br/>\nleather armor, with a piar of Derv Rings I go myself in<br/>\nNRo, one +3WIS earring i was given, and a pair of SP<br/>\nHide Gloves I bought with all the money I had at the<br/>\ntime (17pp). Now that I have just about all the items<br/>\nI think I&#39;ll need for awhile, WIS of 179 and about<br/>\n1kpp in the bank (with all my lvl 34 spells already<br/>\nbought), I look back and laugh at how tough it was!!!
