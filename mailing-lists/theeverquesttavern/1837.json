Many of my friends who started out about the same<br/>\ntime as me have gone way up in level (high 30&#39;s and<br/>\n40&#39;s) while I just hit 27. They may be real good at<br/>\ngrouping and killing and getting tons of money and<br/>\nexperience, they know very little about the quests, npcs and<br/>\nlay of the land. I , on the other hand, have found<br/>\nmany quests they did not know about (faydark ringmail<br/>\nfor instance) and can navigate through many of the<br/>\nzones almost blindfolded. &lt;br&gt; I had to laugh when one<br/>\nof them (name removed to protect her 35th cleric&#39;s<br/>\npride) did not know how to get to Kaladim from the druid<br/>\nring and then needed to be shown where the bank was.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt; As for wisdom, don&#39;t let it worry you. Your game<br/>\nplay can always be adapted to match your mana pool. As<br/>\nfor myself, I am a halfling druid who started with<br/>\n115 wisdom. Now, after many purchases, exchanges and<br/>\nquests I have a wisdom of 168. If you want an extra<br/>\nwisdom point, just go buy some paladin pickles from<br/>\nBoomba the Big in Freeport. It&#39;s amazing what some<br/>\npeople will trade for stat enhancing food and even<br/>\nalcohol. ;)&lt;br&gt; As for me, fish scales are always needed.<br/>\nI am bravely exploring all the underwater regions<br/>\nof Norrath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye Cousteau&lt;br&gt;The Wolf of<br/>\nKarana&lt;br&gt;27th Aquanaut</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
