She just got started so she&#39;s still lvl 1. (lol I haven&#39;t even <br/>\nkilled anything yet.) I have never played a mage before. How much <br/>\nharder is it to play then an enchanter?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I&#39;m sorry for not posting lately. I&#39;ve had some major tests in <br/>\nBio and Psych. I&#39;ve also managed to break my hand again so it&#39;s in a <br/>\ncast. The bad part is the cast goes past my elbow so it&#39;s kinda hard <br/>\nto use a mouse right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be able to play more during the Quarter Break. I&#39;ll also be able <br/>\nto play a bit more next quarter since my schedule won&#39;t be so <br/>\nhorrible and the classes will be easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaven<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., PsyKo &lt;sibilant_ghost@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Okay so far we have 2 ppl up for it how bout some more ???<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
