Our ISP is<br/>\nRoadRunner, they are unwilling to help us find the problem,<br/>\nbut we think we know the problem. We cannot connect<br/>\nto EQ using our cable modem but we hooked up our old<br/>\nphone modem and d/led AOL and now we CAN get back on.<br/>\nSo it must be something having to do with the cable<br/>\nconnection. Other people using cable and ethernet are also<br/>\nhaving problems. Now we have to wait for someone to<br/>\nfigure out what the problem is, which could take days or<br/>\nweeks, because the RoadRunner tech people are not<br/>\nwilling to listen to us or the EQ people telling them<br/>\nthere is a problem. 8(&lt;br&gt;-Khalista&lt;br&gt;Cleric of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
