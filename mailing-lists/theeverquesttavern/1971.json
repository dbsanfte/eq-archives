I mean, if you&#39;re a gnome, you don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to be bound in SF all the time-- what a<br/>\npain!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generally, though, you&#39;re right for any elves. BUT- If<br/>\nyou&#39;re a caster, it&#39;s a lot easier to bind in DC if<br/>\nyou&#39;re staying in Unrest for any amount of time. It&#39;s a<br/>\npain to run back there all the way from GFay if you<br/>\ndie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, Bind just outside the MM zone in<br/>\nLfay if you&#39;re taking on MM. Death is common in both<br/>\nUnrest and MM, so it just makes it easier to be close at<br/>\nhand-- your group will appreciate not haveing to wait<br/>\nfor you--haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BONUS-- all classes can be bound<br/>\nANYWHERE in Gfay. So for melee types, get a bind at the<br/>\nzone boundry to BB if you&#39;re in Unrest (i think it&#39;s a<br/>\ncloser run than Kaladim), zone boundry to Lfay if you&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to MM, or the zone boundry to CB if you&#39;ll be in<br/>\nCB. There are always high level casters at the Wizzie<br/>\nspires who can bind you there, or maybe walk over to the<br/>\nzone with you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-- Unless you do<br/>\nsomething outrageous as the controlled of a Yahoo club, you<br/>\nwill generally not be liable for anything that happens<br/>\nto people who avail themselves of the message<br/>\nboards. To protect yourself further, though, you could<br/>\nput a disclaimer in the Club discription. People have<br/>\nto be responsible for their own actions-- i&#39;d take<br/>\nthat case, in CA at least.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
