Wisps drop them and they usually<br/>\nsell for roughly 1pp. Greater Lightstones are better<br/>\nbut they average 5pp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get a level 4 or higher<br/>\nMagician to summon you a wisp stone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy a<br/>\nlantern.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get someone to cast Serpent Sight on you. It is a<br/>\nspell that grants infravision. Several classes get it<br/>\nat various levels including Enchanters at 12 and<br/>\nShaman at 9.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this list helps you<br/>\nout.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
