Nothing<br/>\nelse changes. No added bonuses. If you don&#39;t play on a<br/>\nPvP server it really isn&#39;t worth it. And on PvP<br/>\nplayers you don&#39;t have to hand in the book anyway. Very<br/>\nfew people become PK&#39;ers on standard servers.<br/>\nRemember you can only kill other players with RED names.<br/>\nSo it&#39;s really pretty lame. If you want to try a PvP<br/>\nserver I highly recommend Sullon Zek. I&#39;m having a blast<br/>\nthere as an Iksar warrior. I can&#39;t wait to kick some<br/>\nnuetral druid butt!! ^_^</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
