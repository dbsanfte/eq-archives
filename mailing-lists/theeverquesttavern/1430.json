The guide is good, especially<br/>\nat lvls 13 and up, as it lets you know which BLUES<br/>\nwill give you more experience. You get more the closer<br/>\nto your level they are. Also, remember (as i&#39;m sure<br/>\nyou&#39;ve all found) that just because a Mob or mobs are<br/>\ngreen, doesn&#39;t mean they wont attack you on site--<br/>\nespecially if they hate you OR you are sitting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope<br/>\nthis helps -- &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 17th<br/>\nseason&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
