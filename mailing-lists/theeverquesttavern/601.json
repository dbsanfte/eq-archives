You<br/>\nalso cannot drop the item; i.e. click on the item,<br/>\nthen click on the area of the screen that shows the EQ<br/>\nworld. If the item is a dagger, then a dagger should<br/>\nappear on the ground near where you were standing when<br/>\nyou dropped it. No drop is used to avoid twinking,<br/>\nwhen a higher level character gives his items to a low<br/>\nlevel character of his. If a magician loots a powerful<br/>\nwarrior-only sword, he may create a warrior so he can use the<br/>\nsword. But if it&#39;s no drop, all the magician can do is<br/>\nhold on to the sword, put it in a bank, or destroy<br/>\nit.&lt;br&gt;&quot;LORE ITEM&quot; means that your character will only get one<br/>\ncopy of that particular item in his EQ lifetime. Take<br/>\nfor example the Bloodfire, an extremely powerful<br/>\nwarrior-only sword. It&#39;s 1 handed, so a warrior could use 2 of<br/>\nthese with dual wield and become very powerful. But if<br/>\nthe sword is lore, then the warrior can have but one<br/>\nof these. Does this help? Sorry so<br/>\nlong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Half-elf warrior of 12 seasons&lt;br&gt;Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
