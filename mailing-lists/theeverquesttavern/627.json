Luckely my party was still there.<br/>\nWe did lose another member and I feel bad about that<br/>\nbecaus eit was his first time in Ro and on top of that<br/>\nhe&#39;s a blind human. Hope someone will help him get out<br/>\nif he logs back on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also noticed that SK<br/>\nare better in a group then I thought. Taunting skill<br/>\nis at 65 for me and words quite well most of the<br/>\ntime and if that doesn&#39;t work I cast dissiease cloud.<br/>\nOne hell of a taunt.. put&#39;s ya right on top of a<br/>\nMob&#39;s agro list and if hunting several enemies at a<br/>\ntime it sometimes makes everyone turn on you. But<br/>\nhaving a good healer is absolutly cool in that<br/>\nmatter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Often I would concentrate on the casters while a druid<br/>\nwhatched my back. And healed me when I got further then to<br/>\nbubbles of health down. The others would get the rest and<br/>\nI&#39;d join them asap. We rocked again. Having a group<br/>\nthat knows what it is doing is great. When we got a<br/>\nthug we rooted or snard him and had two tanks on him<br/>\nand got him down very fast everytime.&lt;br&gt;I love being<br/>\nin a good group. But because of the lag and a bummer<br/>\nheadache I called it a night. To bad because I got very<br/>\ngood xp on dervs I&#39;m half a bubble from 12. And I want<br/>\nmy meditate skill!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good hunting all!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
