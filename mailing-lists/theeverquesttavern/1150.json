Monks are hand to hand fighters - perhaps you may<br/>\ndevelope a weapon skill for the fun of it but you will be<br/>\nmore affective going hand to hand. You can get a pair<br/>\nof magical gloves such as Netted gloves and you will<br/>\nbe able to hit creatures that can only be hit by<br/>\nmagic (like wisps). Netted gloves are pretty easy to<br/>\nget-go to everlore.com to get info on them. Anytime I<br/>\nhave ever grouped with monks they have never used<br/>\nweapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Is Round Kick better than Tiger Claw? I cant<br/>\nreally help you there, sorry. I would say to develope<br/>\nthem both-keep both skills maxed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; How much<br/>\nweight? I believe the amount of weight you can carry<br/>\nwithout penalty is 14 pounds (one reason you probably<br/>\ndont want to use a weapon). Monks have natural AC that<br/>\nwill suffer if you are carrying too much weight. I<br/>\ndont know if it affects your attacks or not. Remember<br/>\nthat coins have weight and will encumber you if you<br/>\nare carrying alot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Well, I hope this helps -<br/>\nHappy hunting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Venture T`Asp&lt;br&gt; 20 Necro &lt;br&gt;<br/>\nSaryrn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
