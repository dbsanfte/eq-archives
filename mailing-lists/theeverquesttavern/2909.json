Even tho my idea for an<br/>\n  all mage guild didn&#39;t work.. I have a new idea =) <br/>\n  Bazaar is going to be REOPENED in Freeport... how is<br/>\n  this possible you ask?  Well, if we all take our<br/>\n  business to FP, then we can open up a mini-bazaar of<br/>\n  course for the time being, we won&#39;t have the niceities<br/>\n  of AFk and such, but, with enough people there we can<br/>\n  sell on the auction channel and just tell people we<br/>\n  are in FP... the upside to FP is that ANYONE can go<br/>\n  there. (short of certian evil people which may often<br/>\n  use disguises to get in or just up faction)  The idea,<br/>\n  is lead by example.. Start selling your goods in FP<br/>\n  and others will come and do the same... if we start<br/>\n  doing this on ALL the servers, verant might take and<br/>\n  do something about it.. who knows, we might even have<br/>\n  afk merchant abilities after a few months.... tell<br/>\n  your friends ... tell your clients... tell the people<br/>\n  who HATE luclin altogether, the bazaar is opening in<br/>\n  FREEPORT and we SHALL succeed !!!! <br/>\n<br/>\n    talk to yall later,<br/>\n      Marshun PsyKo, <br/>\n  AKA Willim Lupin Tribunal server 20th season<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________<br/>\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Yahoo!
