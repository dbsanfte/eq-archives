Now I&#39;m only a level 7<br/>\nmonk and have no chance of going there any time soon<br/>\nBUT...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love the new customize options. Now all I have to<br/>\ndo is redo my colors again. Trying to find a color<br/>\nfor text that works in Full Screen and the small<br/>\nscreen modes. Being able to get to inventory in Full<br/>\nScreen ROCKS. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone else&#39;s opinions? To me the<br/>\ncustomization options in and of themselves pay for the<br/>\nexpansion. But that&#39;s just me. Wish they did something<br/>\nsimilar for the Spellcaster&#39;s mem. But I&#39;m sure they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t so the spell casters would still be unable to see<br/>\nwhen memming new spells or what not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman,<br/>\nMonk of 7 on Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
