I know that I will<br/>\nalways have an account so long as I have a valid c/c and<br/>\nmy cd codes, but will my characters still be there<br/>\nif I have not played them in some time? I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I would be too upset if I have to make new<br/>\ncharacters &#39;cause it&#39;s always fun starting from scratch.<br/>\n*grimaces* But if I have to, well then I guess I have to.<br/>\n....hhhmmm reminds me of another question? What&#39;s a good<br/>\nserver to be on? I was on E&#39;ci with some friends (the<br/>\nones who twisted my arm to get me to play EQ in the<br/>\nfirst place!) but they have stopped playing so I am<br/>\nthinking of changing servers. Thanks for letting me ramble<br/>\na bit. The Raven</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
