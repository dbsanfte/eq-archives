(But even then, you may be<br/>\nhelping a Pally who had LoH and didn&#39;t want help!!). If<br/>\nsomeone gives a train shout, it is more often a warning<br/>\nAND a cry for help with the train. If someone doesn&#39;t<br/>\nshout, they either are being rude to those about to get<br/>\ntrained (or...gasp!!.. doing it on purpose??), or are<br/>\npulliing the train to take it on (usually with a group<br/>\nthat&#39;s nearby). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s my question-- what zones<br/>\nhave the biggest or scariest or toughest trains?? At<br/>\nlower levels, not much compares to BlackBurrow-- the<br/>\ngnoll trains from below, to the zone, can be huge. I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen in Unrest for a few weeks now, and I&#39;ve not seen<br/>\nmore deadly trains. When you&#39;re camping in the Round<br/>\nRoom, and all of the sudden you see dozens of mobs and<br/>\nrealize that there are ghouls, darkbone skellys, drybone<br/>\nskellys, barbed skellys, carrion ghouls, skeletal monks--<br/>\nand then you notice a few dusty werebats, an animated<br/>\nhand and a festering hag come in-- UGH!! time to run<br/>\nto the zone and give tons of shouts!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am<br/>\nbound in Dagnar&#39;s Caludron, just at the ent to Unrest.<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;ll log on, and there will be 20 or more<br/>\ncharacters there, in various states of undress and health.<br/>\nBIG train got pulled and nearly everyon in the zone<br/>\neither died or had to zone out. If you go to Unrest,<br/>\nmake sure you know if someone is hunting for the<br/>\nghost, and make sure that they&#39;re competent. More times<br/>\nthan not, ghost groups seem to pull the entire house<br/>\nout to the zone. I&#39;ve died in Unrest more than in any<br/>\nother zone (including those early days in GFay and CB),<br/>\nbut it was worth it because of the friends I made<br/>\nthere and the adventures!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serrafina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
