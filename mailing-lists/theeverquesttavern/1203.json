I know<br/>\nppl tell me that you end up with more copper weighing<br/>\nyou down that way. But if you don&#39;t do that, it<br/>\nbecomes a matter of one person being honest enough or not<br/>\nforgetful enough to keep count after every<br/>\nloot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hrm... random alpha loot for nicer items? Ideally nice.<br/>\nI can see it&#39;s benefits at higher levels for nicer<br/>\nitems. I&#39;m beginning to see that every method has its<br/>\nflaws though. My concern is for every day loot though.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My level 9 spells are over 5 plat (I believe-- was<br/>\ntired when I last checked). Every rusty weapon I loot<br/>\nis an extra gold and an extra chance at<br/>\nBlacksmithing early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh well... I guess if I&#39;m really<br/>\nthat concerned about money-- I&#39;ll just go and kill as<br/>\nmany bees as I can. I could probably make quite a bit<br/>\nof plat each hour I do that. I just hate to kill in<br/>\nnewbie areas just b/c I need plat. They need the exp.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m not high enough to kill wisps yet, else I&#39;d do<br/>\nthat for the exp and lightstone&#39;s for plats.<br/>\nSigh/grin. Now that I know about that, I won&#39;t sell my light<br/>\nstones to shop keepers and gls to players for 5 plat. =)<br/>\nSeen the posts, figured that&#39;s what would be<br/>\nsuggested. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
