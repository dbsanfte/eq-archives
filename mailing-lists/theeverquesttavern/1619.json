On Lanys T&#39;Vyl, Firiona Vie has<br/>\nalready summoned Tunare to speak with her about the<br/>\nfuture of Norrath. Cazic-Thule&#39;s avatar arrived and<br/>\nbanished the Mother of All, as well as corrupting both<br/>\nEquestrielle and the entire Lesser Faydark. LFay is now a<br/>\nmenacing place, dark and deadly. Undead sprites, the<br/>\ncorrupted forms of the once noble Fairy, flit through the<br/>\nwoods and attack any whose light offends<br/>\nthem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rugen Payne, of Ordo Ursi Prismatus, has gathered<br/>\ntogether the individuals who have the most knowledge and<br/>\nability to command, and appointed us as generals to<br/>\ngather and command armies in defense of the good aligned<br/>\ncities of Norrath. I have been appointed to the defense<br/>\nof Kelethin, my home city. If you are from the Lanys<br/>\nServer, and wish to participate in the coming events,<br/>\nplease go to htpp://lanys.com/index1.htm and read the<br/>\nmessage boards, particularly under the Tavern heading.<br/>\nThe First Fist of Light, a guild on Druzzil Ro (I<br/>\nbelieve...could be Drinal) has a LOT of info on their page. We<br/>\nhave links to it from the General section of the<br/>\nLanys.com message boards. This is a HUGE thread, nearly 40<br/>\npages in length, with a great amount of info. It may<br/>\ntake you HOURS to get through it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norrath is to<br/>\nundergo some huge changes in the coming months...I hope<br/>\nyou all are prepared for the War that is to<br/>\ncome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral Stormfang&lt;br&gt;Ranger&lt;br&gt;Commander of the Knights<br/>\nof Prophecy&lt;br&gt;General of Kelethin&lt;br&gt;Lanys T&#39;Vyl</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
