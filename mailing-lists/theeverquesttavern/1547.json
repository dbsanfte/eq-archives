You know, /who tells level class name<br/>\nguild. I use /role with my warrior and get constantly<br/>\nasked for heals, buffs, sows. I guess a wood elf<br/>\nwarrior is kind of rare. My druid stays fully<br/>\nidentifiable. /who tells you all about him. And yet, believe it<br/>\nor not, I rarely am asked to sow or buff/heal<br/>\npeople. I also find it amusing of the number of people<br/>\nwho /shout need sow plz constantly but never check to<br/>\nsee who can do it. They just expect someone to be<br/>\nable/willing to do so at their command. And some of them don&#39;t<br/>\nhave any patience. I don&#39;t keep sow memmed. I have<br/>\nwolf form. Who need spirit when you can be one? You<br/>\ntell them just a sec while I mem it, they say NM and<br/>\nrun off. :P to them. If you&#39;re on the Rathe and I&#39;m<br/>\naround, send me a tell that you saw me on this board and<br/>\nI&#39;ll sow you if you&#39;re close by.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye<br/>\nCousteau&lt;br&gt;The Wolf of Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
