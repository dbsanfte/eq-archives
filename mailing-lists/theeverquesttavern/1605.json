You no longer lose XP at 5. This was patched a<br/>\ngood while ago, but I&#39;d be hard pressed to say exactly<br/>\nwhen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. This was in a more recent patch. Verant&#39;s<br/>\nreasoning (and a sound one, amazingly) was that Delevelers<br/>\nin PvP were ruining the game for new players. By<br/>\nputting this in place, they effectively cancelled out the<br/>\nonly good side-effect of deleveling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.<br/>\nAccording to Absor, on EQ&#39;s Developer&#39;s Corner (Check under<br/>\nFeedback at www.everquest.com), you haven&#39;t been able to<br/>\nbuff/heal an NPC since Beta testing. I haven&#39;t been around<br/>\nthat long, so I can&#39;t confirm that. But I&#39;d assume an<br/>\nemployee of Verant, especially Absor, would<br/>\nknow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Well, it&#39;s entirely possible those Kodiaks were<br/>\non a different faction (Unkempt druids, maybe?). I<br/>\nknow that I have to be careful in Rathe Mountains as a<br/>\nRanger because the bears there are scowling at<br/>\nme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral Stormfang&lt;br&gt;Commander of the Knights of<br/>\nProphecy&lt;br&gt;Lanys T&#39;Vyl</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
