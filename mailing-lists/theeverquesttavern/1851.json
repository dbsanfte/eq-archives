For the most part, I group with anyone well.<br/>\nAlthough chanters and bards increase my effectiveness 10<br/>\nfold. At level 30-- had a bard and chanter in my group.<br/>\nI was the only healer (there was a paly but he was<br/>\ntoo busy to heal-- puller and all). I healed, DS, and<br/>\nbuffed without any problems with only a 128 wisdom. I<br/>\nwas in Skyshrine. Easy exp for me. Chanter mezzed<br/>\nadds-- me and bard slowed runners. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) I do need<br/>\nmore experience in knowing my zones though. I always<br/>\nget lost. =-) I&#39;m too used to being able to gate out<br/>\nof problems now. LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) There are always<br/>\npeople bickering and stuff. But that happens. Everyone<br/>\nhas bad days. I try to empathize. Perspective is<br/>\neverything. Sometimes-- yeah... you&#39;ve got rude ppl. But a<br/>\nlot of times, it&#39;s just perspective and maybe<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s having a bad day or wasn&#39;t thinking when they<br/>\nsaid something. Goodness knows I&#39;ve done that.<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Dang, between being sick, school, and work... EQ<br/>\ndang it... not enough time for it. LOL. That and doing<br/>\nVLARP, and sheesh. Anyhoo.... (darned bronchitis. Still<br/>\nnot sure if I should even attempt going to work and<br/>\nto speak on the phone. Telephone tech support stinks<br/>\nwhen having Bronchial issues)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone be well<br/>\nand enjoy the game! It&#39;s still a ton of fun and<br/>\nLucian&#39;s a few months away.
