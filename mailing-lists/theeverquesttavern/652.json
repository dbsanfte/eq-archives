Flowing Black Robes (FBR) are very popular<br/>\nand can be bought for a little over 200pp from<br/>\nplayers. But those are found in Najena which is in East<br/>\nAntonica. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it sounds like you&#39;re over in Fayder,<br/>\nso you might want to try to buy a Robe of the Keeper<br/>\ninstead. They are dropped in Mistmoore which borders<br/>\nLesser Faydark. Players sell them for roughly 80pp,<br/>\nwhich IMO is too much, but whatever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are<br/>\njust some options available. These assume you are<br/>\nbetween level 10 and 25. If you&#39;re above that, then you<br/>\nprobably already have a good robe. If you&#39;re below level<br/>\n10, then I&#39;d just be happy with the robe you started<br/>\nwith if I were you. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter<br/>\non Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
