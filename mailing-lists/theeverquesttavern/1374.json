However,<br/>\nb/c it (Intelligence) does affect how fast you gain<br/>\nin SKILLS-- it is important. A bonus when you&#39;re<br/>\nthinking, man, why doesn&#39;t my backstab or my dodge go up<br/>\nfaster. Or man, I drink one drink and I&#39;m drunker than a<br/>\npig in a poka dot dress. (Don&#39;t ask.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Int is<br/>\nimportant but also-- time you play battling exp mobs raises<br/>\nyour skills anyway. So it&#39;s a tough call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also,<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if they mentioned it, hybrid classes<br/>\nused to drain exp from a group-- now it balances out<br/>\nto almost be a gain (but not really-- almost extra<br/>\nexp though).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also that Warriors take less exp<br/>\nto level than other classes. They&#39;re designed to die<br/>\na lot and deal damage-- tanks and more. So that&#39;s<br/>\nwhy they get an exp benefit-- the first to die in a<br/>\nbattle gone wrong is often the Warrior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now not<br/>\nall Warriors feel like that, but when I used to play<br/>\na Warrior (gave all my stuff away on the Veeshan<br/>\nserver -- was only level 16 anyway)... I tried my best<br/>\nto imitate that... but it&#39;s hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On thing<br/>\nthat I used to do was the mantra... &quot;I am tank-- if I<br/>\nyell run... run for zone... no questions<br/>\nasked.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS man I go on and on... apologies<br/>\nppl. =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
