(You are a Halfling,<br/>\nright?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gnoll Lariat is 3/20, but with AC of 3, and stun.<br/>\nThat&#39;s a nice thing -- you stun something while soloing,<br/>\nyou could actually swing around and do a backstab,<br/>\nwith good timing. Can&#39;t tell when it procs, however;<br/>\nprobably around 25 or so. Dropped by Tesch Mas Gnolls and<br/>\nGnoll Commanders in Split Paw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Dragoon Dirk<br/>\nis another nice weapon for a Rogue (6/23, +2 Dex, +3<br/>\nvs. Magic, fits in Range slot (just don&#39;t throw it!).<br/>\nDrops off of Ambassador D&#39;Vinn in Crushbone, who&#39;s a<br/>\nnasty SoB. There will probably be very intense<br/>\ncompetition for this weapon, if there isn&#39;t<br/>\nalready.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And heck, if you&#39;re there to kill D&#39;Vinn, may as well<br/>\nkill the Emperor himself for the Dwarven Ringmail<br/>\nTunic (AC12, +8 vs. Magic, Fire, Cold). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You<br/>\nhave been to The Safehouse, haven&#39;t you?!<br/>\n(www.thesafehouse.org)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go forth and backstab, young Rogue!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
