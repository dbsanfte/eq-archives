I<br/>\noften just walk up to folks and say hello, but the<br/>\nbegging for SoWs or other stuff has jaded them so much<br/>\nthat they often say, &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m not a Druid.&quot; Fine, I<br/>\nwas just trying to say hello. I rarely ask for SoW<br/>\n(although I love to have it when hiding/sneaking), but for<br/>\nthe rare occasions when I do, I&#39;ve actually hotkeyed<br/>\na social RP request. &quot;I am on a mission from my<br/>\nguild masters . . . Would you be so kind as to bestow<br/>\nSpirit of Wolf on me, if you could?&quot; It comes out as a<br/>\ncouple of lines, but that&#39;s OK. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two funny things<br/>\nhappened in the last couple of days, sort of germane to<br/>\nthis discussion. Last night, I died in Crushbone and<br/>\nhad to run back all nekkid. I got a bit twisted<br/>\naround, and had to ask directions. Watched politely (and<br/>\nnot hidden) as some big Barb killed a centurion, then<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Excuse me, which direction is the entrance to<br/>\nCrushbone?&quot; And he walked away to go kill some more stuff.<br/>\nHmph. I wandered around a bit more, getting my bearings<br/>\n. . . and came across him fighting three or four<br/>\ncenturions. And for all his nice shiny armor (a major<br/>\ntwink,perhaps?!), they stomped this Barb into the ground. I was<br/>\nhiding/sneaking, and it was sort of fun to watch. Felt like adding<br/>\na comment like &quot;Be polite next time and you might<br/>\nget some help!&quot;, but I refrained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this one<br/>\nfrom two nights ago is better . . . even though it&#39;s a<br/>\nlong story. Whenever I go to Kelethin, when I see a<br/>\nfellow Dwarf I tend to stop and say hello. I kind of<br/>\ndislike the place (very high platforms, and it&#39;s very<br/>\nconfusing), and it&#39;s nice to see a friendly face. So I saw a<br/>\nDwarf and said hello, and we got to talking. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>\nnoticed a Wood Elf nearby with the same surname, and<br/>\nasked if that was his partner. He said yes, they had<br/>\nmet while adventuring, etc. She SoWed me and they<br/>\ncast a couple of other buffs on me. I told him he was<br/>\na lucky Dwarf . . . &quot;She has a sister, you know!&quot; I<br/>\ndemurred, saying I wouldn&#39;t want to impose the life of a<br/>\nRogue on anyone (and besides, my real-life wife would<br/>\nhave a cow). So the Wood Elf Druid mentioned the name<br/>\nof her sister . . . and I realized I had adventured<br/>\nwith her! We hooked up once in Butcherblock to kill a<br/>\nFire Drake, and she later suggested we meet the next<br/>\nday. She had some scarab armor she wanted to give me.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The server had died the next night, however, so we<br/>\nnever got together again. Her sister then said, &quot;Wait<br/>\nhere, she asked me to give you something if I ever met<br/>\nyou.&quot; So she ran to the bank and came back with a some<br/>\nScarab boots and a Splitpaw Belt -- both were marked<br/>\nimprovements over what I had on. It was great -- meeting<br/>\nsomeone in character, having a conversation, getting some<br/>\nbuffs and some items just for being in the moment.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s what makes this game great.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course,<br/>\nthen the newbie who had been bugging me all night for<br/>\nitems or gold showed up, asking me to show her (a him,<br/>\nreally) who to give the bard letters to. Said s/he had a<br/>\n20-something level warrior on another server . . . and here<br/>\ns/he is, begging for items as a first-level HE<br/>\nmagician. Couldn&#39;t even get the dang letter from the bard<br/>\nin Felwithe -- I had to tell her to answer with the<br/>\nwords in brackets!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s what makes the game<br/>\nnot so fun sometimes, although it was good to help<br/>\nsomeone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gee, maybe I should do some work today . . .<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;11th season rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
