I&#39;ve gotten<br/>\ntired of the number of times I&#39;ve gotten ignored. It&#39;s<br/>\nnot that I don&#39;t try to teach. It&#39;s that ppl don&#39;t<br/>\nlisten. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I remember the first time I ever<br/>\ngrouped. I was SUCH a scrub. But I listened to the ppl<br/>\nthat had experience. I remember having trouble<br/>\nfiguring out what drawing was. LOL. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday, I<br/>\ntyped my fingers raw trying to explain the concept of<br/>\n&quot;drawing&quot; and &quot;giving our casters time to med&quot;. My fingers<br/>\nare actually sore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I actually dropped out of<br/>\na party earning mad exp b/c things were too pell<br/>\nmell. Don&#39;t get me wrong. Badly organized groups can<br/>\nmake lotsa exp. Just too dangerous, and chaotic.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Am I being too picky here? I might be losing<br/>\nperspective b/c of playing this game too long. Don&#39;t have fun<br/>\nin an unorganized group. Dying is okay as long as it<br/>\nisn&#39;t stupid death. There&#39;s enough adrenaline even when<br/>\nin a good group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) That being said-- any<br/>\ntips on looting in groups? How can a group keep from<br/>\nbeing bogged by loot details and stay well oiled?<br/>\nLately, I&#39;ve had trouble not sitting down and trying to<br/>\norder a group when I join. I feel bossy when I do that.<br/>\nHopefully other&#39;s don&#39;t think I&#39;m being harsh or bad.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think I&#39;m going to set down the policy that if<br/>\nI&#39;m lead in a group-- I&#39;ll always add new members<br/>\ntill I&#39;m full. I&#39;ve found that works well-- and<br/>\nusually someone knows the choice places to sit in a zone.<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman,FatedHue-- out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... Sorry for the long post. Sigh.<br/>\nI&#39;m a long winded man/wood elf/ Iskar. =)I was also<br/>\nin a strange mood to rant a bit. Thanks for bearing<br/>\nwith me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
