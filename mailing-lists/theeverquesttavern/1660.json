Druid<br/>\nroleplayers, on the other hand, are incredibly few and far<br/>\nbetween. With all my characters I try desperately to<br/>\nroleplay to my best, but some are just easier/more fun to<br/>\nroleplay. For instance, I have a monk who I roleplay as a<br/>\nmute. He doesn&#39;t speak, except to his guild superiors<br/>\n(for training and quest purposes) to everyone else he<br/>\neither shows his intentions through emotions (emotes) or<br/>\n/e scribbles on a scrap of parchment &quot;(whatever<br/>\nneeds to be said)&quot; and passes it to (whoever he is<br/>\nconversing with). It takes a little bit longer to have a<br/>\nconversation, but it&#39;s different. In groups however, he is in<br/>\ntune to the immediate mental powers of those around<br/>\nhim (hence groupspeak) and he tends to speak in very<br/>\neloquent thoughts. So... you&#39;ll never see a /shout from<br/>\nRoen. /OOC with train! perhaps, or even an /auc ooc:<br/>\nWTB such-and-such.&lt;br&gt;I like roleplaying my troll<br/>\nwarrior, simply because instead of just taunting like so<br/>\nmany warriors do, he insults the target. Something to<br/>\nthe effect of &quot;Hey %T! You mudder is a hairy<br/>\nhalfing!&quot; Hehehe... Halflings are his favorite snack, and<br/>\nhe&#39;ll tell you so. Hehe.&lt;br&gt;Anyways, there&#39;s no real<br/>\npoint in any of that, but in a world filled with shouts<br/>\nof &quot;Dr00d Newbie wants Phat Lewts!&quot; or other such<br/>\ngarbage, it is difficult to maintain IC all the time.<br/>\nHaving a guild of RPers does help, and I&#39;ve been meaning<br/>\nto get Roen into one. Hehe... Roen the<br/>\nmental-intuned, mute monk. Agnostic monk at that. None of that<br/>\nsilly god stuff, or magic, or weapons to worry about.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;On Xev there is a RP guild named &quot;Covenant of Lore&quot;<br/>\nI believe it is.... I know I&#39;ve heard of one on<br/>\nMithaniel Marr server, but I&#39;ve yet to run into a guild of<br/>\nRPers on Karana. About time someone started<br/>\none!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;&quot;My mother was an elf, dad.. well..<br/>\nhe was a hippie, my sister&#39;s a tree and my brother&#39;s<br/>\na wolf. I&#39;m always out of mana, I eat stuff off the<br/>\nground and I&#39;ve foraged grubs for the past hour and a<br/>\nhalf.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roen&lt;br&gt;:glares coldly at a gnoll commander&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gamek<br/>\nFrogsmasher&lt;br&gt;&quot;Hey Cain Darkmoore! You mudder is a hairy halfing!&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
