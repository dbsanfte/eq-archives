First thing, if you haven&#39;t <br/>\nalready, you should visit the official EQ Tech Support page: go to <br/>\nhttp://eqlive.station.sony.com, click on Technical Help on the left.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, your processor.  A Pentium II 200 MHz will not cut it, so that <br/>\nwould be the basic problem.  Your RAM should come in 64 or 32 MB <br/>\nincrements, so you probably have 128, 192, or 256 MB.  You could have <br/>\n224, but that would be an odd amount; if it&#39;s cobbled together using <br/>\ndifferent kinds of RAM, that could also be a problem (but not one <br/>\nthat would prevent you from running EQ).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 256 MB of RAM, if you&#39;re running the Luclin expansion, you will <br/>\nonly be able to use about half the new models.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWin NT and Linux are different operating systems - you probably have <br/>\nWindows 95, 98, or XP.  I hope you have Windows 98, because Windows <br/>\n95 does not support DirectX 8.1, which you need to run the new <br/>\ngraphics engine.  That could be your basic problem, either that or <br/>\nthe processor.<br/>\n<br/>\nRequired specs, from the Official Sony page:<br/>\n<br/>\nWindows┬« 98/2000/ME/XP  &lt;---- Need to check this.<br/>\nPentium┬« II 400Mhz or greater &lt;----------------<br/>\n256 MB RAM <br/>\n16 MB Direct3D compliant video card  &lt;--- Your card is fine.<br/>\nDirectX 8.0 compatible sound card  &lt;------ ??<br/>\n28.8k (or faster) Internet connection <br/>\n4X speed CD-ROM <br/>\n450 MB+ hard drive space  &lt;---- HD is OK, unless you&#39;ve already <br/>\nfilled it with stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: Although technically below the minimum specs, players with 128 <br/>\nMB of RAM will still be able to run Luclin by turning off the new <br/>\ncharacter models. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecommended Specs:<br/>\n<br/>\nWindows┬« 98/2000/ME/XP <br/>\nPentium┬« III or greater <br/>\n512 MB RAM <br/>\n32 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&L (i.e. ATI Radeon <br/>\nor Nvidia GeForce 2 or greater) <br/>\nDirectX 8.0 compatible sound card <br/>\n56.6k (or faster) Internet connection <br/>\n16X speed CD-ROM <br/>\n1.5 GB+ hard drive space<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: DirectX 8.1 or greater is required for Windows 98 ,XP, ME, and <br/>\n2k. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Windows, go to Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools, and open <br/>\nup System Information.  That will tell you some of the basic info we <br/>\nneed, like RAM and Windows version.  Won&#39;t tell you your processor <br/>\nspeed, unfortunately.  If you don&#39;t have System Information, you <br/>\nprobably have Windows 95 and will need to update to Windows 98, XP, <br/>\nor 2000.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, here&#39;s the info from that page on Direct X:<br/>\n<br/>\nDirectX 8.1 or Higher Required <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With the release of EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, we require <br/>\nDirectX 8.1 or higher. This is true not only for those purchasing <br/>\nShadows of Luclin, but for everyone playing EverQuest. All details <br/>\nregarding this change can be found here: <br/>\nhttp://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000348.html<br/>\n<br/>\nTo determine what version of DirectX is currently installed on your <br/>\nsystem:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Click the Start menu. <br/>\n2. Use the Run.. command.. <br/>\n3. In the Open field, type &quot;DXDIAG&quot; then click OK. This will launch <br/>\nthe DirectX diagnostics tool. <br/>\nYour version of DirectX will be listed at the bottom of the System <br/>\nInformation area. For example, version 7.0a is listed as &quot;DirectX 7.0 <br/>\n(4.07.00.0716)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease do the following prior to playing EverQuest. It is very <br/>\nimportant that your drivers are installed in the order indicated to <br/>\navoid potential problems:<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Go to https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?<br/>\nReleaseID=27741and install the latest DirectX drivers for your <br/>\noperating system. <br/>\n5. Go to the website for your 3D accelerator. There are a number of <br/>\ndifferent manufacturers, and it is preferred that you visit the <br/>\nwebsite for the manufacturer of your card. At your option, you can go <br/>\nto the chipset manufacturer site. Most will be able to use either <br/>\nwww.3dfx.com (for Voodoo cards), www.atitech.com (for ATI cards) or <br/>\nwww.nvidia.com (for TNT/GeForce cards). Download and install the <br/>\nlatest drivers appropriate for your card and operating system. See <br/>\nour Video FAQ <br/>\n(http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/audio_video/general_video_t<br/>\nroubleshooting.jsp) for more details. <br/>\n6. Go to the website for your sound card manufacturer and do the <br/>\nsame. If you do not know what brand of sound card you have, you can <br/>\nright-click on &quot;My Computer&quot;, select &quot;properties&quot;, click on &quot;Device <br/>\nManager&quot;, and open the &quot;Sound, Video, and Game Controllers&quot; section. <br/>\nYour sound card will be listed there. If you use a SBLive sound card, <br/>\nyou can run &quot;LiveUpdate&quot; from the Windows Control Panel off of your <br/>\nstart menu. View our Sound FAQ <br/>\n(http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/audio_video/general_audio_t<br/>\nroubleshooting.jsp) for driver locations and more details. <br/>\nIf you experience any problems, please do the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Run DXDIAG.EXE from your Start menu (click start, run, then <br/>\ntype &quot;dxdiag&quot;) <br/>\n8. Click the &quot;Save all Information&quot; button at the bottom of the <br/>\nprogram window. <br/>\n9. Save the file as &quot;dxdiag.txt&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nEmail that file to eqtech@... along with a complete <br/>\ndescription of your problem, the &quot;dbg.txt&quot; file from your EverQuest <br/>\ndirectory, the text from any error messages that are presented, and <br/>\nif you are willing to assist our test department over the phone, a <br/>\nphone number where you can be reached.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nKharlisht, Leofrice, Nazbeku, etc.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
