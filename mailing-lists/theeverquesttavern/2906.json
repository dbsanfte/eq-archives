They are not <br/>\nbehind any doors, so it&#39;s just a good ol&#39; find &#39;em and whack &#39;em <br/>\nevent. When the foreman pops, he does a zone wide saying and appears <br/>\ntowards the back on the first level, between the two skulls in the <br/>\nwall. Kill him and Sir A will spawn in the same spot. <br/>\n<br/>\nBefallen is decent. I still visit it with my 28 war once in a while. <br/>\nOn the way to the 2nd level, that is when you will find much more <br/>\nsks, necros, and mummies. They will swarm you. But since this quest <br/>\ncan be done with out going down there or through any doors, you <br/>\nshould be fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nTimmye Cousteau<br/>\n39 Druid<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In theeverquesttavern@y..., fire_n_butterfly &lt;no_reply@y...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi to all.
