A lot of ppl want to move servers<br/>\nevery month and it&#39;d generate a LOT of extra work. I<br/>\nwould hazard to guess there&#39;s at least a couple hundred<br/>\npeople a month. 2) There would be characters that would<br/>\njump from one server to another to twink friends. Ever<br/>\nhear of anyone complain about such and such a Power<br/>\nguild ruining a new server? Usually this is the heart<br/>\nof the argument.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to say, there are<br/>\nprobably even more reasons why this policy is in place. I<br/>\nagree that it is sometimes unfair-- dependent on RL<br/>\nsituations. However, it&#39;s not totally unfair. There are<br/>\nreasons behind it. And again, as I understand it-- it has<br/>\nnothing to do with said, &quot;Illegal activitites&quot;. It&#39;s an<br/>\nattempt to protect the other players that could be<br/>\nadversely affected by the addition of a &quot;Power&quot; character.<br/>\nParticularly if seen as an addition to a &quot;Power Guild&quot;.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only recommendation I have is to try to appeal<br/>\nfor an exception. Gluck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FatedHue/shooman<br/>\nout&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... Personal note. I have no troubles with that.<br/>\nGuilds are nice b/c ya&#39;ll are friends. Power Guilds are<br/>\nnice b/c I group a lot and get benefits from them<br/>\nconstantly. But I know a lot of friends whome hate it b/c<br/>\nthere are guilds that just help twink. This creates<br/>\ncharacters that don&#39;t learn how to actually play the game,<br/>\nhow to group properly, and ends up in a lot of<br/>\ndeaths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t mind twinking if you know your character.<br/>\nBut learn what to do when and how to group. Make sure<br/>\nyour skills are up. Many examples where characters<br/>\nhadn&#39;t grouped and didn&#39;t know the benefits of taunt. Or<br/>\nhow many times have characters not known to attack<br/>\nthe mezzed Enchanters pet. Learn from others of your<br/>\nclass. Learn root vs snare. Etc. LEARN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry.<br/>\nPersonal fustrations getting out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
