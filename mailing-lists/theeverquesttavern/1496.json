I have recieved and passed on many<br/>\nitems. But the key was that they were not too far out of<br/>\nmy reach. One of my chars was asked if he was a good<br/>\nperson, I said I think so. I was then given a minotaur<br/>\nribcage and a two handed lamentation blade. Way out of<br/>\nthe reach of a character who is only 5 minutes old. A<br/>\nfine steel blade, more acceptable to me. The funniest<br/>\nsight I have seen was a full lambent covered bard<br/>\nrunning for his life from deathfist pawns. Turns out he<br/>\nwas level one. That&#39;s ridiculous. Makes me root for<br/>\nthe monsters so his corpse would decay before he<br/>\nrecovered his stuff. Now the level 50 two account person<br/>\ntwinking his low level by ksing and camp stealing, death<br/>\nto him. If it&#39;s reasonable, I don&#39;t have a problem<br/>\nwith it. I&#39;ve given away many a &#39;low&#39; thing to new<br/>\nfolks. But what really irks me are the ones who come up<br/>\nand demand stuff. You&#39;ve encountered them. No hail,<br/>\nno nothing. Just a tell &#39;Gimme some plat&#39;.<br/>\nRepeatedly. Along with gimme some equipment. I died and don&#39;t<br/>\nhave anything. If so, wht are you in full ringmail and<br/>\ncarrying a sword while talking to me?! IDIOTS!!!<br/>\nARRRGGGHHHH. And we don&#39;t find your &#39;hey baby you&#39;re cute&#39; and<br/>\nworse messages arousing nor funny. It ruins the game<br/>\nfor some of us. Maybe the guys playing girls like it<br/>\nbut not I. It made me go and start a male character<br/>\nto get away from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I seem to have gotten<br/>\noff topic. Sorry. In summary: reasonable twink-ok,<br/>\nunreasonable-bad&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keiyuki</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
