To make it short...A guy/friend of mine<br/>\nin my guild for about 8 months wanted to borrow my<br/>\nTalon&#39;s Bracer, cuz i wasn&#39;t really playing my ranger at<br/>\nthe time, i said sure, just want it back sometime in<br/>\nthe near future. Well, a few months later I asked for<br/>\nit back, he said np, come to KC...I said i cannot i<br/>\nhave to log, will get it tomorrow, he said np. WELL!!!<br/>\nhe never logged on for 3 days, and when he did, he<br/>\nleft my guild and stole my F&#39;n bracer! Maybe a bit<br/>\nstupid on my part, but 2 years ago, I would have been<br/>\nhard pressed to find someone to pull that shit!<br/>\nsigh.....not to mention 40 attempts yesterday on my account<br/>\nbeing hacked! WTF. okay lol i will calm down now =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
