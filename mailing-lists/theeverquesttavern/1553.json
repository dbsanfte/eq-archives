But<br/>\nthere are so many rude newbies, that assume that they<br/>\nare entitled to buffs, coin, items-- that it just<br/>\ngets to me sometimes. If i&#39;m at the bank in Kelethin<br/>\ntrading and talking to friends, and I get spammed with<br/>\n&quot;Sow me Please?&quot; ten times, I&#39;ll often cast harmony on<br/>\nthe newbie, and say &quot;chill out and come see me in 5<br/>\nmins.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just wait till I hit lvl 24 and get<br/>\nwolfform-- no going /anon then. I took a screenshot one day<br/>\non Orc Hill where a druid in wolf from was<br/>\nsurrounded by about 15 newbies, all saying &quot;Can I get SOW??&quot;<br/>\nSo much spam, I had to leave the area due to the<br/>\nlag!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If someone comes up to me and asks for<br/>\nhelp, i&#39;ll usually help. If someone does a /who all<br/>\nsearch, and give me a tell from across a zone asking for<br/>\na SOW, I think that ruins the roleplay aspect,<br/>\nwhich I love. Sometimes I&#39;ll respond with &quot;if you can<br/>\nfind me and ask nicely, I&#39;ll consider it,&quot; or even<br/>\n&quot;What are these pestering voices in my head? Mother<br/>\nTunare, deliver me from this madness!!&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will<br/>\nnot only give buffs, but items to those who see me<br/>\nand roleplay the request for SOW. &quot;Oh wise student of<br/>\nMother Tunare&#39;s gifts, might you show me the ways of the<br/>\nwolf?&quot; When this newbie walked away from me, he not only<br/>\nlearned of the ways of Tunare, but was fast, rock hard,<br/>\nand floating off the ground. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had a Troll<br/>\nsay &quot;Heh, U not so Fast, shory one. U gimme da wolfie<br/>\nfeets and I race you fast!&quot; We made a wager, we raced<br/>\n(of course I won, but I let him keep his wager), and<br/>\nI gave him some additional buffs for this fun<br/>\nrequest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These were people who found me while<br/>\n/anon-- which I will often go just to get away from the<br/>\nmadness. But they will find you, and ask you anyway-- and<br/>\nI am happy to oblige most times. It&#39;s that tell<br/>\nfrom across the zone-- &quot;Can you come to the dock to<br/>\ngive me sow???&quot; that I&#39;m getting away from. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My<br/>\n2sp worth (Hey, I&#39;m lvl 20 now, that&#39;s<br/>\ninflation).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
