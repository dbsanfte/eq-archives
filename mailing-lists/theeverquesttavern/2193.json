Magic, lore, dragons, etc have always interested<br/>\nme. Playing EverQuest allows me to interact in a game<br/>\nwith thousands of other people who share at least one<br/>\ncommon interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve made many friends ingame<br/>\nand regardless of distance and limited interaction<br/>\nwith them in a game environment, I have become close<br/>\nwith some of them. I suppose it could be seen as a<br/>\nstep up from the Pen Pal relationships of older<br/>\ndays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know couples who play, and use the game as a<br/>\nplace to escape together in something they both<br/>\nenjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People all over the world play this game and almost<br/>\nnever worry about race, religion, disabilities,<br/>\nillnesses, sexual preference, etc. If you like games and<br/>\nenjoy the Sci-Fi or Fantasy realms, you may like<br/>\nEQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And God help you if you do, cause it can be<br/>\naddicting. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Synthe Hateblade&lt;br&gt;Mythic<br/>\nLegion&lt;br&gt;Druzzil Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
