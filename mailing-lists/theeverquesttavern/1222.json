Plus it lets you<br/>\nlook to see a little of what it might look like before<br/>\ngoing into the game (from what I can<br/>\nremember).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or if you&#39;re the type that likes to do things<br/>\nmanually... I go into the EQsupp that patched recently. Then<br/>\nI look to see what the text color I want to update<br/>\nis called. (They&#39;re all numbered). Then I pull up<br/>\nPowerpoint or some other RGB enabled program. Then I adjust<br/>\nthe RGB numbers in that program till it&#39;s the color I<br/>\nlike. Then I plug those numbers into the RGB 3 code for<br/>\nthat channel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s a lot easier than I&#39;m<br/>\nexplaining it. But again, it&#39;s up to your preferences. Other<br/>\nthan a few settings changes the EQ color editor works<br/>\ngreat. I&#39;ve never tried the Caster site... but sure that<br/>\nworks as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS That EQ<br/>\nsupp explains pretty well how to edit your<br/>\nEQclient.ini. I&#39;ve tweaked these last two weeks my colors as<br/>\nwell as logging in with run turned on, etc.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
