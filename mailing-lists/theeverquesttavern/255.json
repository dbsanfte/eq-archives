I<br/>\ndon&#39;t mean to argue the point, but I want to make sure<br/>\nbecause I always dreamed of marching around in a suit of<br/>\ngreen plate in a Ranger fashion. If anyone knows<br/>\nwhether this rare armor exists at all or if it is simply<br/>\nnear impossible to find, please let me know. If Green<br/>\nSplinted does not exist, then is there any other armor<br/>\nthat shows up as green plate that a ranger can<br/>\nwear?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trellan Hawksight, Wood Elf Ranger of 20 seasons.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
