Just as<br/>\nlong as you&#39;re on the Tunare server and I can reach<br/>\nyas pretty easily. After all, being only of the 19th<br/>\nmeans I can get to SOME places, but ah... I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nexpect me to come help you fight in Nektulos or Grobb...<br/>\nhehe. NOTE: I don&#39;t GIVE things away, not usually.<br/>\nBuffs and Binds, yes. Teleports? ..Gonna have to wait<br/>\nawhile before I get those. :) I will help with food<br/>\nstuffs, spells, and hunting. But PLEASE don&#39;t think I&#39;ll<br/>\ngive up my Observer&#39;s just to help... I may be kind,<br/>\nbut kindness has it&#39;s limits, unfortunately... I<br/>\nremember, a friend of mine donated 50pp to help out one of<br/>\nhis friend&#39;s characters. Needless to say, that<br/>\ncharacter wasn&#39;t seen again after that night... My friend<br/>\nwas pretty upset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; So... if your on the Tunare<br/>\nserver, look me up! Whether it be to ask for a possible<br/>\nbuff, bind, help with a SMALL quest, spells, etc. As<br/>\nlong as you ask nicely. I was helped out when I needed<br/>\nit, it&#39;s time to repay the kindness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; See you<br/>\nin Norrath!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ~Teppeny&lt;br&gt; Halfling Druid<br/>\n(wannabe Bard) of the 19th&lt;br&gt; Souls of Peace&lt;br&gt; Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
