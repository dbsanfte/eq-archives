It will connect as fast if not faster<br/>\nthan&lt;br&gt;your computer. You don&#39;t have to worry about your<br/>\nHard&lt;br&gt;Drive crashing or some other nasty computer<br/>\nproblem&lt;br&gt;with the PS2. It has a GREAT video graphis<br/>\nsupport,&lt;br&gt;AND it playes DVDs without a seperate CD-ROM<br/>\ndrive.&lt;br&gt;The computer has its advantages also but it will<br/>\nput&lt;br&gt;a HUGE dent in your wallet compared to the PS2.<br/>\nMy&lt;br&gt;opinion is to get the PS2. Besides Computers are<br/>\noutdated&lt;br&gt;every 30 seconds, but with the PS2 you&#39;re sure it<br/>\nwill&lt;br&gt;be up to date for years (until PS3).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
