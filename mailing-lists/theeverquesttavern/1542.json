But when I gave up my level 16 character to move<br/>\nto Drinal... I gave up all of my stuff to a friend<br/>\nthat had just died and lost all their stuff due to<br/>\nfalling off the boat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was a BBC, a Silvery<br/>\nWar Axe 1h, lotsa bronze, a crafted bracer, and about<br/>\n150 plat, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve finally settled down on my<br/>\nfavorite class: Druid. I&#39;m sorta weak b/c I spent too much<br/>\non Str and not enough on Wisdom... but it&#39;s my<br/>\nexperience that makes me valuable (IMHO).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve also<br/>\ngot about 20 or 30 characters. I&#39;ve deleted very few<br/>\nof them. Although level 30 is by FAR the highest<br/>\nI&#39;ve ever gotten. I typically run out on the character<br/>\nat around level 5, although I&#39;ve got many above 7<br/>\nand three or so above 12, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My point is,<br/>\neveryone actually defines twinking differently. I&#39;ve never<br/>\nthought of coins as twinking till about 4 months ago. And<br/>\neven so, I usually use it to buy spells. Some ppl<br/>\nmight think a level 12 character in Black Iron armor,<br/>\nbanded and Bronze is twink. Others have no problem with<br/>\nthat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helping out others-- and how it relates<br/>\nto twinking... I don&#39;t know. I just have troubles<br/>\nfiguring that out. If someone hands you a set of lambent<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re level 1 as a bard-- do you turn it down?<br/>\nIt&#39;d just go to someone else if ya did<br/>\nso....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
