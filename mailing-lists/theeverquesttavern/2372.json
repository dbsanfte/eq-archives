I can sing us<br/>\nfast across distance using a song that I have just<br/>\nscribed. I have accidently found myself in Butcherblock,<br/>\nand there are some low level monsters, but I have not<br/>\nmade it to the Dwarven City which has access to the<br/>\nwater. Also, I was hoping to do some fishing!!! Let me<br/>\nknow, I may stay for a while, level up and get some<br/>\ncrushbone belts before I travel. Also, I owe these orcs a<br/>\nfew casualties so I will be around. /tell Daevyd if I<br/>\nam on if you are interested. Thanks all.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
