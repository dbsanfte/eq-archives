And it pissed me the hell ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-288133125\">::Nukai cracks his knuckles to tackle a topic he<br/>\nhas tackled before::&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the beginning, there<br/>\nwas loot. &lt;br&gt;And it was good.&lt;br&gt;Then there was phat<br/>\nlewt twinkies.&lt;br&gt;And it pissed me the hell<br/>\noff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I share feelings with you about the level 50 guy<br/>\ntwinking his level 5 druid. I also find the tale of the<br/>\nlevel 1 lambent-covered bard quite humorous. Now I will<br/>\nbegin with my spiel on it all.&lt;br&gt;I confess. I have<br/>\ntwinked my characters, as well as donated some to my<br/>\nbrother&#39;s character. Note: My bro really did lose his<br/>\nstuff, all of it. He was level 16 when I helped him out<br/>\nwith a FS longsword and a fair amount of banded mail.<br/>\nSince then I have assisted him in getting his Ivy tunic<br/>\n(cause I got some braided Ivy cords out of the deal!)<br/>\nAnd he promptly returned my mail to me. So this is<br/>\nmore of a loan. My characters on the other hand are<br/>\nmore a model for a certain kind of item or armor. Such<br/>\nas I created a wizard so I could see someone wear my<br/>\nflowing black robe and water crystal staff, he&#39;s level 2<br/>\nbut I like him. I have a shaman level 4 with totemic<br/>\ngauntlets (never try to do totemic quests for money, you<br/>\nget stuck with the item) and a harpoon of the depths<br/>\n(a trade for a pair of gem inlaid gauntlets). My<br/>\nwarrior troll I have played straight up to level 9, and<br/>\nonly now am I beginning to buy him some armor, but<br/>\nthis is a style matter. I am hooking him up with<br/>\nred-dyed fine plate, I hope it looks good. He gathered the<br/>\nfungus for the dyes, I am only assisting in the<br/>\nfinancial department.&lt;br&gt;You will always be pissed at<br/>\nsomeone lower level than you with better stuff. I was, in<br/>\nfact I still am. Every time I see a druid lower (I&#39;m<br/>\ntalking level 5 or 6 here even) than me with runed<br/>\nmithril bracers, I want to reach out and smack them. But<br/>\nI get over it, the reason they are twinked is<br/>\nbecause they have a higher up that went through all the<br/>\nrights of passage (unless they had a friend power level<br/>\na druid to 34 and raised the cash through<br/>\nteleports). Don&#39;t hate them because they are twinkies, hate<br/>\nthem for being bastards (such as the camp-stealing lvl<br/>\n50, mentioned earlier). &lt;br&gt;There are good twinks out<br/>\nthere, but it all depends on the player. I have grouped<br/>\nbefore with both rising primaries and decked-out twinks.<br/>\nAs long as they know what they are doing, I am okay<br/>\nwith things. I just don&#39;t want to hear &quot;Train to zone!<br/>\nWerebat is after me!&quot; from a level 4 paladin wearing some<br/>\nkickass armor wielding a ghoulbane. (For those of you<br/>\nunfamiliar with Unrest, a werebat is still blue to a 35<br/>\ndruid, something a real level 4 pally would never go<br/>\nnear).&lt;br&gt;Anyways, don&#39;t hate me because I twink up some of my<br/>\npeople.&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
