They start shouting<br/>\nKill stealer when I take a sister every now and then<br/>\nfrom this newly arrived group. I don&#39;t think that<br/>\nanyone should assume they own anything just because they<br/>\nhappen to be there when no one else is. I know it all<br/>\ndepends on the situation, and that might should make<br/>\nright in certain situation. Some lone player shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nassume that he can get into rotation for a rare spawn<br/>\nwith a whole group. I personally don&#39;t think the GMs<br/>\nshould get involve, if 2 powerfull groups can&#39;t find a<br/>\nworking relationship and share items then they should<br/>\njust compete for it, it&#39;s more realistic than bringing<br/>\nthe game masters into it, it totally disrupts the<br/>\nwhole roleplaying atmosphere. I think its a good rule<br/>\nbut it should be enforced rarely.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
