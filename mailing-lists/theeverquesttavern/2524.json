Since I know that<br/>\nI will be playing within a month to two months I<br/>\nneed to have a char, just in case my others are wiped<br/>\nout. So I am thinking Enchanter, Druid and yes the all<br/>\naround basher Warrior. My question is this then. When<br/>\nyou start the char they ask you to put the points in,<br/>\nso what is a good distrubition of these stats for<br/>\neach char type listed here? Also for these char thypes<br/>\nwhat are the better races? (I know for war the best is<br/>\nTroll &#39;cause they get regen, but the faction sucks so I<br/>\nmight just go with Human.) Hmm..can&#39;t think of anything<br/>\nelse so I guess I&#39;ll go for now. *yawn* have to get up<br/>\nearly for work tomorrow. Night. The Raven</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
