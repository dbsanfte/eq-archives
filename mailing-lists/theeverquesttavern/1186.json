I have now finished that quest.<br/>\n=) Course when one has to work at 6am and you answer<br/>\nlike 2 calls in first two hours before it picks up--<br/>\nOne has a lot of time to read posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as<br/>\nEQ-- still a lowly 4th lvl Druid. But having lotsa<br/>\nfun. Helped a guild get formed yesterday. Hoping it<br/>\ndoes well. It&#39;s a bunch of ppl from work. But it&#39;s<br/>\ndefinately an interesting bunch. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of it&#39;s<br/>\nprimary rules was &quot;no twinking&quot;. I protested to that as I<br/>\nwas an advocate of twinking. There after-- I found<br/>\nout that my definition of twinking is different than<br/>\nguild&#39;s def. I guess everyone thinks of twinking as a<br/>\ndifferent thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think of twinking as decking out<br/>\nyour new character or level 4 character with a magic<br/>\nweapon (like a druid equivalent of 1h silvery axe would<br/>\nbe twinking to me). Or giving your character full<br/>\nBanded/bronze (silk if you&#39;re a monk). Or giving your character<br/>\n100 plat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m curious what ppl define as<br/>\nTwinking. Is what I defined here &quot;twinking&quot; to<br/>\nothers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m asking b/c I couldn&#39;t see how skills would suffer<br/>\nfrom this and now I see. I&#39;m a big believer in upping<br/>\nskills. I&#39;ve also discovered from friends that my plan of<br/>\nmaking money with the Monk is a bad plan. Which is why<br/>\nI&#39;m going back to druid. Following my GM&#39;s<br/>\ninstructions on the slow but sure way to gain money for<br/>\nspells. And using my monk for future plans of a character<br/>\nwith Master levels of all trade skills. Grin.<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK... I&#39;ve rambled on enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out...<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FatedHue- WE Druid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... feel free to comment on any<br/>\nportion of post. The Twinking, the Monk&#39;s being bad at<br/>\nearning money, the reading of posts-- heck even the PS if<br/>\nya want. Once more. I apologize for writing so much.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
