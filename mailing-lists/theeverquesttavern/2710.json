And so far I like the character.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is exactly how restricted is it to play a Dark Elf when I <br/>\nreach upper levels. I know that they are not liked in some places in <br/>\nthe game and guards kill you and stuff. But is it going to be so bad <br/>\nthat I&#39;m totally restricted to a small area and its not gonna be fun <br/>\neventually? I just don&#39;t want to get to level 30 or so and find out <br/>\nthat I can&#39;t go behind the areas I&#39;m already exploring.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
