It&#39;s a level based game with a<br/>\nwide variety of skills, including combat and trade<br/>\nskills. You can use some of the skills to create your own<br/>\nitems for sale or personal use. You can also exchange<br/>\nmost items with other players. You can either play<br/>\nsolo, or with up to 5 other players. If you group with<br/>\nothers you split the experience automatically, and share<br/>\nthe faction hits and bennies. There&#39;s also an option<br/>\nto split loot automatically.&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s a very big,<br/>\nhighly detailed campaign world with hundreds of npc&#39;s,<br/>\nmany of which give you quests to go on. And has<br/>\nchallenges for levels as low as 1 to as high as 50,<br/>\ndepending on the area you&#39;re in. Also in my opinion it&#39;s<br/>\ngraphics aren&#39;t anything to sneeze at.&lt;br&gt;I recommend a<br/>\nwarrior at first, just to get used to the game.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
