I have some friends that<br/>\nare male but play female chars online. I could never<br/>\nunderstand why they would do that until I saw what you are<br/>\ndescribing, people just give them stuff, lots of stuff, not<br/>\nknowing they are really males behind the EQ masks! I<br/>\ncould never play a female char, it would just be too<br/>\nweird, but I understand why others do. I have also seen<br/>\nmy friends flurting with players even to the point<br/>\nof traveling to visit, most of the time coming home<br/>\ndisappointed. I tried to tell them to get a clue, they dont<br/>\nlook like they do in the game, but you know what?....<br/>\nneither do you!!&lt;br&gt;That is all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanjien&lt;br&gt;19th<br/>\nseason WE Ranger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uinan D&#39;Mortuus&lt;br&gt;26th season<br/>\nDE SK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erollisi Marr Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
