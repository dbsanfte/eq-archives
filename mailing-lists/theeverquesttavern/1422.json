When you get<br/>\nto higher levels, it makes more of a difference,<br/>\nbecause certain blues and greens (&quot;high greens&quot;) will<br/>\ncause you problems, when you might think they&#39;re easy<br/>\nkills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The named dwarf is CB (Rondo Dunfire, I<br/>\nbeleive)is around all the time. HAHA-- i remember the first<br/>\ntime i saw him- I thought he was a PC helping me take<br/>\non a tough Cent. Then I realized that this little<br/>\nfellow was punching me!!! He is now KOS for me whenever<br/>\nI&#39;m in CB, and I always leave the tongue and give a<br/>\n/shout for people who may be searching for it. (travel<br/>\nto CB, you may get lucky and pick it up without<br/>\nharm). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for hide/sneak - anyone know this<br/>\nanswer for sure? I&#39;d like to know, because a (a wood<br/>\nelf) have had some probs with getting caught while<br/>\nhiding. I have heard that if you /con a mob while hiding,<br/>\nthat you get a different message (ie. he looks at your<br/>\nindifferently instead of threateningly). I need to try this.<br/>\nBTW - those orcs and oracles in BB, near the bandit<br/>\ncamp, are usually a LOT tougher than the ones in CB.<br/>\nAfter I was done raiding CB, I would still occassionly<br/>\ncamp that evil shrine for good XP. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head to<br/>\nKelethin and visit my people!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;Druid of<br/>\nthe 17th season&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
