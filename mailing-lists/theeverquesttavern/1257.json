I was a<br/>\ncomplete addict, I played atlest 9 hours a day, even<br/>\nschool nights, I let it take over my life. I was able to<br/>\nget a paladin to lvl 55, win roll on CoF, win roll on<br/>\ngranite face grinder, and many other high end items. I<br/>\nalso got a cleric to 47, and started him on collecting<br/>\ngear from hate. Overall, I put in too much time into<br/>\nsomething that doesnt give back. I could have been working<br/>\nout, studying, working, anything, but no, I was<br/>\nsitting on my computer playing EQ.&lt;br&gt;Dont get me wrong,<br/>\neverquest is the most fun and most involved game I have<br/>\never played in my life, but not without a cost<br/>\n=/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone whos life was a little like mine, and you are<br/>\nthinking of quiting, I highly suggest it. You will go out<br/>\nmore, and have more fun in general. I used to get<br/>\nstressed like crazy, like while raiding naggy or PoF, and<br/>\nthe server would go down. I about pulled my hair out<br/>\nand broke down over a game =/ Pretty pathetic. Now I<br/>\njust keep in touch with all of the friends I made, and<br/>\ndo the things I used to do when i was &quot;normal&quot;<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;by the way, my name is bob =)&lt;br&gt;im a new member<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;gotta head out, have a great day&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;bob d</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
