Two<br/>\ncorrections/adds though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Start losing Exp at level 5. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t believe you can lose the level 5 level though.<br/>\nBut you can lose exp at that level. So that&#39;s when<br/>\nyou want to stop dying. Grin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) You can lose<br/>\nskill points IF you lose more than 2 levels. For<br/>\nexample, if you had a very bad luck streak-- went from<br/>\njust inside 25 all the way to just under 23 (which<br/>\nwould really STINK btw)-- you would also go down to max<br/>\nskill points you could have at level 24. (I believe. I<br/>\nknow you lose skill points though).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope that<br/>\nclarifies. Again -- to reiterate...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Don&#39;t want to<br/>\ndie after level 5 b/c of exp loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to lose two levels to dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>\nout&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic-- just hit 31 again!
