Trolls and Ogres are good in that<br/>\nthey are very strong but not very smart so dont learn<br/>\nskills very fast. I havn&#39;t tried and Iksar so dont have<br/>\nmuch to say about them except that they cant wear the<br/>\nreally cool SK quest armor so that is a<br/>\nbummer.&lt;br&gt;Anyway, good luck and have fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uinan<br/>\nD&#39;Mortuus&lt;br&gt;DE SK of Erollisi Marr Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
