Ive started to use this <br/>\n  server as healers and casters only. Id like to buy wis gear that can <br/>\n  get me up to level 50 ish or so. Even though you arent on the server <br/>\n  Im on. The name and stats of the items that you own or have owned <br/>\n  plus the estimated value of said items, would prove very helpfull. If <br/>\n  thou art on my server, send me a tell, to the name of Odraneol. I <br/>\n  also have yet to apply a surname to myself. please help in my search. <br/>\n  and ill always pay it forward with the newbies on my server. Im <br/>\n  usually bound in Greater Faydark, and I hunt in Unrest. And will <br/>\n  continue to do so until, i ding 30 and get my pet. please remember <br/>\n  this, live long and prosper.     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Odraneol <br/>\n  21st Level<br/>\n  Barbarian Shaman<br/>\n  Shadows of Conquest<br/>\n  Druzzil Ro <br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., &quot;John&quot; &lt;kamorm@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Hail,<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I have been at this stoopid game for close to 3 years.
