Ran<br/>\nacross this on at Allakhazam (everquest.allakhazam.ocm)<br/>\nin the Rogue strategy discussion. Someone got popped<br/>\nby an Orc Legionnaire while hiding and recuperating<br/>\nfrom a Griffin attack: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;LOL well First of all<br/>\nu could have horrible fraction with ORCS. And<br/>\nsecondly aren&#39;t legionnaires RED to you. Hiding from<br/>\nhigher lvls isnt as successful as from things that con<br/>\nBLUE and GREEN. Keep this in mind. The Griffin<br/>\nprobabaly would have killed u too if he got up close. If u<br/>\nhunt ORC u pretty much have bad faction with them so<br/>\nthe orcs anywhere are aggro to u. Even orcs with<br/>\nnames. If it looks like an orc it hates<br/>\nyou!!!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That makes much more sense - but jeez, why don&#39;t they<br/>\ntell you this at the guild hall?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>\nKaladim&lt;br&gt;7th season Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
