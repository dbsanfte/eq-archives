Chances are you&#39;ve had this<br/>\nbefore - an icon of a boot surrounded by blue stuff<br/>\nappears in a corner of your screen. It&#39;s a really good<br/>\nspell, lets you run away from monsters and aids in<br/>\ncorpse retrieval.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When someone &quot;zones&quot;, the<br/>\nperson moves to a new zone. A zone is a region of the EQ<br/>\nmap. You know you enter one when you get that<br/>\n&quot;LOADING...PLEASE WAIT&quot; message in your chat box and you didn&#39;t<br/>\nfight anything. An example of two zones is North Qeynos<br/>\nand South Qeynos. Zoning is pretty effective strategy<br/>\n- if you&#39;re in a losing battle, go to the nearest<br/>\nzone so you can run away - if you make it, the monster<br/>\nwill leave you alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for PoD and lego pad,<br/>\nI have no idea - chances are someone else does.<br/>\nHope this helps!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Warrior of 11<br/>\nseasons (still)&lt;br&gt;Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
