Her<br/>\neyes were filled with fear and confusion and she had a<br/>\nheadache from thinking too much. In her hands, she fumbled<br/>\nslowly with a large precious stone, red in color.<br/>\nPerhaps it was a ruby, but she wasn∩┐╜t sure; she was just<br/>\ntrying to distract herself from why she was really here.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a distance she could see the backside of an<br/>\nancient and long-since ruined temple, cursed to be<br/>\nforever haunted by the undead. Such a temple, so close to<br/>\nthe entrance to her home city, proved convenient<br/>\ntraining grounds for the warriors and mages of her people,<br/>\nthe Dark Elves of Norrath. On this side of the<br/>\ntemple, however, was nothing of any importance or<br/>\nconsequence, so Twinstar knew this was a place she could be<br/>\nalone. And today she needed her privacy more than ever.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do you think she was serious?&quot; Came a familiar and<br/>\nfriendly voice. She glanced up at the source of the voice,<br/>\nher pet. In her mind, she could see his lips moving<br/>\nas the words had formed, but he had no lips. She<br/>\nlaughed a little at the thought, but her mood stifled it<br/>\nquickly. He was merely a summoned pet, no different from<br/>\nany other. Except that he could talk and he was a<br/>\nfully sentient being, capable of making his own<br/>\ndecisions; not a mindless drone like every other pet<br/>\nTwinstar had ever heard of. Why he was so different was<br/>\nstill a mystery to both of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a few<br/>\nmoments, she returned her gaze returned to the stone in<br/>\nher hands. &quot;I... I don∩┐╜t know, Dolan,&quot; she responded<br/>\ndistantly. Her voice was weak and quiet, strained by the<br/>\nweight on her shoulders. Her whole body felt the weight.<br/>\nShe sat there for several moments in silence before<br/>\nshe continued. &quot;I wish I could just shrug this off--I<br/>\nwould have shrugged it off... but she knew about you.<br/>\nHow can I explain that away?∩┐╜ Dolan stood there in<br/>\nsilence, staring off into space as though he were the<br/>\nwitless pet he was supposed to be. He knew as well as she<br/>\ndid how important it was that they keep his<br/>\nuniqueness a secret. Most Dark Elves were suspicious and<br/>\nsuperstitious folk; if anyone found out, the consequences could<br/>\nbe disastrous. Twinstar had every right to be<br/>\nconcerned for that reason alone. If they couldn∩┐╜t explain<br/>\nthat, then everything else the Gypsy had told them<br/>\nwould hold an undeniable credibility and it was that<br/>\npoint that brought them here today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;There has<br/>\nto be plenty of reasonable explanations. Maybe she<br/>\njust figured it out? We couldn∩┐╜t have expected to keep<br/>\nthis secret forever,&quot; he said finally. It was a weak<br/>\nargument, he knew, but it was all he could offer.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;But she said your name, Dolan, remember? Maybe she<br/>\nfigured it out, but then how could she have known your<br/>\nname?&quot; Twinstar was becoming more and more sure that<br/>\nthere was no way the Gypsy could have known that much.<br/>\nThey∩┐╜d spent the last few years guarding this secret<br/>\nfiercely. She∩┐╜d told only one person and he∩┐╜d never betray<br/>\nher, she was sure of it. There wasn∩┐╜t any way she<br/>\ncould explain this away. Her mood tipped even further<br/>\ndown, now. &quot;I think we∩┐╜re in much deeper than either of<br/>\nus realize.&quot;<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;=============================================&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To read more, please visit the Interactive Story at:<br/>\n&lt;a href=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315\">http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315</a> target=new&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315&lt;/a\">http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please come by and visit!
