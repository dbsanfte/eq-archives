The<br/>\npoint is, though, now those who don&#39;t like twinks can<br/>\ngo to other, newer servers-- ie. Sullon and Firiona,<br/>\nwhere there is the TLC and only one char for that<br/>\nserver. Sure, there will always be those who get multiple<br/>\naccounts so they can twink, but it will be less. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>\nknow it&#39;s not ALL twinks, and probably not even a<br/>\nlarge percentage, but I&#39;ve had problems with obvious<br/>\ntwinks farming, camp stealing, kill stealing, and other<br/>\nthings. Same or slightly leveled uber twinks can run in<br/>\nand solo things that my hard found group is going<br/>\nafter. /rude on them!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW-- Firiona Vie is a<br/>\nmust try for those who like to play natural (ie. no<br/>\ntwinking). Each special weapon/armor piece is sacred AND you<br/>\ndon&#39;t skip by the great (and underutilized) quests in<br/>\nmany of the zones in favor of PLing and and spending<br/>\nthe hundreds of plat that a lvl 10 char would<br/>\nnormally not have. My level 14 rogue is very proud of his<br/>\nmismatched collection of leather armor, 2 pieces of banded,<br/>\nand the Freeport Militia Tunic!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are<br/>\nright-- to each there own. That doesn&#39;t mean I have to<br/>\nlike it!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 36th<br/>\nseason&lt;br&gt;Xev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rumble&lt;br&gt;Rogue of the 14th Station&lt;br&gt;FV</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
