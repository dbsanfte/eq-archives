Let me do<br/>\nthis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Human monk&#39;s advantage-- can travel in a lot of<br/>\nareas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskars are pretty limited on cities and banks.&lt;br&gt;1)<br/>\nIskars regen faster and usually deal a bit more damage<br/>\nthan humans&lt;br&gt;2) Iskars see a bit better and swim at<br/>\nmaster levels starting out.&lt;br&gt;3) Iskar monks get forage<br/>\nstarting out.&lt;br&gt;4) Iskar monks start with dual wield. (I<br/>\nforget if human monks do or not. But they sure<br/>\ndo.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alright, now Necro vs SK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given 2 mins prep time to<br/>\nprep each other... necro wins every time. Now this all<br/>\nis assuming PVP spells are memmed rather than Party<br/>\nspells. Necro&#39;s have a bigger pet, can slow and dot, and<br/>\nfear better. The SK has HT but that&#39;s not going to<br/>\nsave him if the necro fears, slows, and dots him well.<br/>\nPlus necro&#39;s have a bunch of other utility spells.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now this all is assuming certain things. I&#39;m not a<br/>\nPVP player so I could play a Necro (which is also a<br/>\nclass I don&#39;t like playing) and get smoked by an SK.<br/>\nThis is assuming equal levels of knowledge of PVP,<br/>\npreparation, and levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Course, an SK with a lot of<br/>\npumices and other things might not lose... it&#39;s just<br/>\nhe&#39;ll have to be better at playing than the necro.<br/>\n(Hey, if a Warrior can win 8 in a Tournament at a Con--<br/>\nyou know any class can win. Warriors are supposed--<br/>\nsupposed-- to be the worse pvp. And yes, PVP stinks to group<br/>\nwith in Non-pvp servers.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
