If someone gave me (or I<br/>\nbought) a 50th level cleric for example I wouldn&#39;t know<br/>\nhow to play it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a lot of things that<br/>\na person learns as they build up a character. My<br/>\nmain is a 30th ranger but if someone gave me a 50th<br/>\nranger I&#39;d still be in the same boat, I wouldn&#39;t know<br/>\nhow to properly play it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a lot of<br/>\nplayer education that goes on in building at character<br/>\nup. Twinking armor or weapons to a character that you<br/>\nyourself built isn&#39;t as bad because you at least know that<br/>\ncharacter and using a weapon doesn&#39;t really take a lot<br/>\nbeyond target and auto attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just remember<br/>\neveryone it is called EverQUEST. That means you quest for<br/>\nthings and thats all part of the fun. Twinking a few<br/>\nthings now and again is ok in my book but just don&#39;t<br/>\nlose sight of the goal! That goal is NOT to get to<br/>\nlevel 60 as fast as you can. Its the journey there<br/>\nthats the fun part. Its the friends that you make along<br/>\nthe way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also keep in mind that all those<br/>\nthings that are sold on either message boards, auctions,<br/>\nor in EQ are attainable by nothing more than<br/>\nQUESTing for them and it doesn&#39;t cost you anything but<br/>\nyour time and thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dinbien&lt;br&gt;30th<br/>\nRanger&lt;br&gt;Bristlebane server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
