The pagan religion of Wicca is often <br/>\nreferred to as The Craft or Witchcraft. Many of the findings of <br/>\nwitchcraft in other religions have been borrowed from Wicca. Such as <br/>\nthe traditional Easter celebrations. Easter is derived from Eostra, <br/>\nwhich is the Wiccan celebration that falls around the time of <br/>\nEaster. Wiccans would paint eggs to celebrate the fertility of the <br/>\ngoddess. Christmas also borrows traditions from Wicca&#39;s Yule, which <br/>\nfalls at the end of December. Even the common appearance of Satan <br/>\nwas pulled from Wicca. When Christianity came to be, christians <br/>\nportrayed Satan as a demonic creature with horns. This was done to <br/>\ntry to bastardize Wicca, because one of the gods worshipped in the <br/>\nreligion had horns. Of course, this varies from practitioner to <br/>\npractitioner, as Wicca is a &quot;free-form&quot; religion with not many <br/>\nthings set in stone.<br/>\n<br/>\n/rant off</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
