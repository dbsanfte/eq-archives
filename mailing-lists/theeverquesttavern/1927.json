Try the orcs that spawn near<br/>\nthe CB ent--they are a little higher level and the<br/>\nnearby zone makes hunting safer. Also, while Legos may<br/>\nbe too tough for your level, there are other mobs in<br/>\nCB that are good. Try heading over to the Slave<br/>\nTents (not the slaver pit by the castle). There are<br/>\nfewer Legos there, and there are a wide range of Cents<br/>\nand Slavers too choose from. You can get keys from<br/>\nthe slavers and set the slaves free for additional<br/>\nXP. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond that-- you can head out to<br/>\nSteamfont and team up with gnomes there-- though most of<br/>\nthe stuff you&#39;ll fight is wandering instead of at a<br/>\nstatic camp (although there are 2 Kobold camps that you<br/>\nshould be able to take with a group). BB has lots of<br/>\ndifferent camps, though I didn&#39;t hunt there until at least<br/>\nlvl 10 (at the chessboard), and later (at the bandit<br/>\ncamp and orc shrine). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have fun-- CB is a fun<br/>\nand fast area. Many lower levels &quot;grow up&quot; there--<br/>\nstarting at the entrance areas, then to slave camp, then<br/>\nto slave pits, then to castle front, then to Throne<br/>\nRoom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
