I was something<br/>\nlike 3rd level at the time, and there&#39;s only one place<br/>\nto get it, if I&#39;m not mistaken -- Emperor Crush in<br/>\nCrushbone. He&#39;s about 20th level, I think, so there&#39;s no way<br/>\nI was going to get that on my own. But if someone<br/>\nwants to give it to me, why prevent that? That&#39;s one of<br/>\nthe cool parts of EQ -- the community. I was<br/>\ncompletely blown away for my first week at how nice people<br/>\nwere in the game; one Dwarf gave me 7 pp to outfit<br/>\nmyself. Yow! (Now that I think of it, when I lost that<br/>\narmor, some halfling gave me a Snakeskin Jerkin; kind of<br/>\na cool thing. Why do people keep giving me<br/>\nstuff?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it would prevent same-account twinking, so maybe<br/>\nthat would just be the price to pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shooman in<br/>\na later post makes a point I guess I could accept<br/>\n-- if you&#39;re not going to use something anyway, why<br/>\nnot give it to one of your other characters? I&#39;ve<br/>\nthought of that when I get a 2H weapon that my Rogue<br/>\ncan&#39;t use, but I&#39;m going to try not to do it.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;EQ attracts a horny crowd&quot; -- ? Well, yah -- most of<br/>\nus _are_ computer geeks, you know. The study I<br/>\nmentioned in an earlier post found that, apart from the<br/>\nlargest group of players (students, 30-odd percent), the<br/>\nnext largest group came from the technical/computer<br/>\nfield (something like 27%). Sheesh, one guy even tried<br/>\nto hit on my female Troll Shadow Knight -- said to<br/>\nbe careful and not to mess up my &quot;purdy&quot; face . .<br/>\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, time to go to Norrath. Good hunting to all of<br/>\nyou.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;10th season Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
