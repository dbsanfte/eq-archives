Soon you&#39;ll<br/>\ncome to a wooden bridge, cross that and follow the<br/>\npath to highpass hold. The path splits up, but theres<br/>\na marker to tell you which way to go. You can bind<br/>\nanywhere in the highpass zones which is quite nice. The<br/>\nrun takes a while, but following the shore will make<br/>\nit alot safer. A good idea might be to /ooc if<br/>\nanyones running that way and ask if you can tag along,<br/>\ntheres always people making the freeport qeynos trip and<br/>\nmost are quite happy to help i find : ) If you do<br/>\ndecide to go further on to Rivervale or Freeport just be<br/>\ncareful not to go through Kithicor woods at night, its<br/>\nrather nasty.&lt;br&gt;Have you tried Kerra Isle? Tons of exp<br/>\nand loot there for someone your level and its not<br/>\nusually crowded. Its the first stop for the qeynos<br/>\nboat.&lt;br&gt;Well, this has been quite long winded hehe.. hope I<br/>\nhelped out a little : )</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
