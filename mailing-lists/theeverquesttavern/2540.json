I was going on the<br/>\nassumtion that the choices were &quot;more damage&quot; or &quot;more AC<br/>\nand Agility&quot; with both choices being more or less a<br/>\nmutually exclusive thing. =) Warriors tend to complain<br/>\nthat they don&#39;t do enough damage. Know that was true<br/>\nof palys and warriors before(haven&#39;t heard it since<br/>\nthey upgraded damge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agility is an often<br/>\nignored stat. The dex in the bracers are way worth the AC<br/>\nloss though unless you&#39;re soloing. You&#39;ll do a bit<br/>\nmore damage, be better with the bow and proc damage.<br/>\n(I say you&#39;ll do more damage b/c you&#39;ll swing a<br/>\nlittle faster.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind slipping at the moment but<br/>\nbelieve you said you were Ranger right? So bow kiting is<br/>\nprobably a concern. (Course I know plenty of rangers that<br/>\ndon&#39;t do it. Don&#39;t see why not. A well timed snare/bow<br/>\npull can get off 3 to 5 shots before you even get back<br/>\nto the group)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
