So....I<br/>\njust got up a half hour early Wednesday morning (Ugg!<br/>\n5:00 is sooo dark!) and had no problem, downloaded to<br/>\nboth computers in about 5mins. Worked great on my<br/>\ncomputer but not on the wifes. Now I have to buy her a new<br/>\nVideo Card because the one she got with the computer<br/>\ncan&#39;t handle the game anymore. This game gets more<br/>\nexpensive everyday!! :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanjien Cheveyo &lt;Free<br/>\nAgent&gt;&lt;br&gt;22nd season WE Ranger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uinan D&#39;Mortuus &lt;Also<br/>\nFree&gt;&lt;br&gt;25th season DE SK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Server Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
