I mean, as a caster, you don&#39;t really have a lot of spells <br/>\nyet, and your spell skills are low.  As a melee, well, there is just <br/>\nso much to do and learn.  That&#39;s the time when you should be out <br/>\nadventuring and sowing your wild oats, but now you have to worry <br/>\nabout your &quot;soulmate&quot; getting eaten by a bear or stepped on by a <br/>\ngiant??  And how are you going to feel if you pull a train down on <br/>\nyour wife and she bites the farm?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI saw wait until you&#39;re older.  Go out and make a (sur)name for <br/>\nyourself, see distant lands.  If she lets you go and you return, it <br/>\nwas meant to be, right?  You hear it all the time-- young couple gets <br/>\nmarried, but the realize they want different things.  He wants to <br/>\nstudy Al&#39;Kabor&#39;s secrets in Erudin, while she wants to vanquish Hill <br/>\nGiants for profit.  Long distance romances just don&#39;t work either, <br/>\neven if one of you is a druid or wizard.  Best to wait &#39;till lvl 30 <br/>\nat least.  Unless you&#39;re a halfling.  In that case, your life <br/>\nexpectancy is not very high, so you might as well breed like the mice <br/>\nyou are as soon as possible!!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo do it right, you need to master jewelry making, and make your own <br/>\nring too. It means so much more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nXela<br/>\nRumbl<br/>\nXev<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., bullions27 &lt;no_reply@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., &quot;erik&quot; &lt;naslund@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;tundrawyrm&quot; &lt;no_reply@y...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  But make sure a few times that the GM will be there.  They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dont keep records of this stuff so petition and make sure that <br/>\n&gt; the Gm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you are talking to can personally do the service.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t necessarily need a GM if the female character does not <br/>\nhave <br/>\n&gt; a surname yet (pre-20 or by choice). However, you will if changes <br/>\n&gt; need to be made.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After that it&#39;s entirely up to the player how their wedding <br/>\nunfolds. <br/>\n&gt; I did mine eons ago when I was around level 13 I believe. It was a <br/>\n&gt; personal wedding, bride, myself, closest friends and a GM (who was <br/>\n&gt; also a good friend) at Qeynos (we were fighting around their for XP <br/>\n&gt; at the time). Two years later we renewed our vows at a neutral <br/>\nzone, <br/>\n&gt; Lake Rathe with the entire guild and drunk members proceeded to <br/>\n&gt; destroy each other at the Arena afterwards for sh**s and giggles :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
