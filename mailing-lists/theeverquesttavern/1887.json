Now that I have a Mid 40&#39;s<br/>\ncharacter, I&#39;ve tried twinking the heck out of some<br/>\ncharacters & I have to admit that it&#39;s pretty funny taking<br/>\nout Yellow mobs in 20 seconds or<br/>\nless...solo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what I&#39;m really curious to see is the Post-Luclin<br/>\ntwinking that&#39;s going to be rampant. I think it will be<br/>\nlike a race to see who can get the first Lvl50 VAH or<br/>\nBST out there. We are already seeing equipment<br/>\nincluding these characters in the race/class<br/>\ncategories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for me you ask? I will definitely be jumping feet<br/>\nfirst into one of the new classes. Undoubtedly there<br/>\nwill be some class balancing issues to begin with & it<br/>\nwill be up to me to figure out what the strengths &<br/>\nweaknesses are before the good stuff get&#39;s<br/>\nnerfed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cya out there</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
