Should I buy the basic game and all the expansion <br/>\n&gt; packs, or just the latest expansion pack?  Are the better expansion <br/>\n&gt; packs than others?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess basicly the question I am asking is.....If you were starting <br/>\n&gt; from scratch what would you buy?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unless you really have your heart set on playing a Vah Shir (the Cat <br/>\ncharacters), then I would buy as little as possible, probably just the original <br/>\nand the Kunark expansion.  That will end up giving you enough zones to try out <br/>\nand almost all of the races to try out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no use putting down $50-60 (especially since half of what you would <br/>\nend up buying you can&#39;t use for, at least, a few months anyway) on a game just <br/>\nto find out that you don&#39;t really like it.  Buy the original and play for a <br/>\nlittle while.  See if you like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing that Planes of Power will give you starting out is quicker <br/>\ntravel (you have to be lvl 46 or above to actually move beyond the first zone <br/>\nthere).  You couldn&#39;t do anything with Scars of Velious at all since it was <br/>\ncreated as a higher levle expansion (lvl 30 and above).<br/>\n<br/>\nSulamwen<br/>\nForest Stalker of &lt;Fate&#39;s Forge&gt;<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
