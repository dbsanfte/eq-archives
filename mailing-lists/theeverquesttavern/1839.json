I was able to<br/>\nbuy some wisdom rings and bracers...but it took all I<br/>\nhad and then couldn&#39;t buy spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, the next<br/>\ntime a Druid gives you a SOW...throw a plat his way<br/>\n(even 1 plat!)...just know that we are extremely<br/>\ngrateful! Can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ll run somewhere<br/>\nto bind some folks (lvl 30 plusses), just to get a<br/>\nfew plat so that I can afford to buy spells. But, as<br/>\nlvl 29 approaches, I&#39;ll be patient knowing that soon,<br/>\nI&#39;ll be able to Transport folks, get a few plat, and<br/>\nactually buy something! :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I started an Iksaur Monk<br/>\nthis past weekend...wow, what fun. I&#39;m level 7,<br/>\ntotally non-twinked, but having a blast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cojim,<br/>\nWood-elf Druid of the 25th Season.&lt;br&gt;Prexus<br/>\nserver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shaojiku, Iksaur Monk of the 7th stage</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
