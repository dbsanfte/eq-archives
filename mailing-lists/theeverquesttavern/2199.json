One is a<br/>\nchat room with fancy graphics. That view emphasizes<br/>\nthe community, and interaction that you get with<br/>\npeople from around the world. That&#39;s not my favorite way<br/>\nto think of EQ, though; if you want that, go to<br/>\nActive Worlds, where all you do is really chat (though<br/>\nyou can build stuff, too).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A second way to<br/>\nthink of it is a MMORPG -- Massively Multiplayer Online<br/>\nRole Playing Game. Think of it this way -- at any<br/>\ngiven time, there are probably between 1000 and 2000<br/>\npeople playing on your server (EQ has about 40 different<br/>\nservers to handle the load). Overall, something like<br/>\n350,000 people subscribe to the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your bf<br/>\never played Dungeons and Dragons or a similar pen and<br/>\npaper-based fantasy-based game, then EQ is like having a Game<br/>\nMaster (or Dungeon Master) ready to play with you at any<br/>\ntime. You get to play-act being something else -- I<br/>\nmainly play a Dwarf Rogue (thief), and a Troll Shadow<br/>\nKnight (evil warrior/necromancer combo). Other folks<br/>\nlike to play &quot;casters&quot; -- magic users, druids,<br/>\nhealers/clerics, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s really just a chance to be<br/>\nsomeone else for a while, for me. What makes it awesome<br/>\nis that you&#39;re constantly interacting with other<br/>\nreal people, and you develop relationships with them<br/>\n(hopefully good ones) over time. Last night, I ran into<br/>\nsomeone I hadn&#39;t played with for quite a while, and it<br/>\nwas like running into an old friend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s<br/>\nlots more, but that&#39;s a good start for now, I<br/>\nhope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht&lt;br&gt;27 Rogue&lt;br&gt;Specializing in backstabbing, corpse<br/>\nrevocery, and Butcherblock Mountains guide service</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
