It comes down to what YOU like to play as.<br/>\nHowever Start out your first character as a human<br/>\nwarrior. They are nightblidn wich really sucks but you<br/>\nshould see that character as a &quot;throwaway&quot; You will get<br/>\nthe hang of playing the game and interacting with the<br/>\ngame engine. Humans have the easiest newby area&#39;s and<br/>\nleast complicated cities, and warriors don&#39;t have to<br/>\nworry about magic. So play one for a while till you<br/>\nfeel confident to start a real character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3)<br/>\nIt&#39;s a long time since i played the tutorial :) but<br/>\nit&#39;s all in there play it a couple of times... it<br/>\nhelps!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Not really. As a newby there will be newby<br/>\nhunting ground where you can spend until lvlv 5 getting<br/>\nexp. you can also do some simple quests getting exp<br/>\nbut most involve killing stuff. In the newby areas<br/>\nthere are guards that will help you if you are in<br/>\ntrouble. But you are never &quot;safe&quot; trying to get<br/>\nexp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) I play on a PII 266 with a voodoo2 card and 160<br/>\nMB RAM. The RAM made a HUGE different while playing.<br/>\nI hardly lag anymore because of my system. On<br/>\nKunard however i need to turn my clipping rate down a<br/>\nlot to be able to smoothly play. (under f10 then<br/>\noptions, display)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
