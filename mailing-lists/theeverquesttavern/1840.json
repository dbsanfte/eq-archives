I know I can<br/>\nmake it back quickly . . . on a good day, I can make<br/>\nclose to 100pp in less than an hour, especially if you<br/>\nport people from Kunark.&lt;br&gt;My rant (ah, there&#39;s<br/>\nalways a catch!) is that lots of people decide they<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to pay me. I can&#39;t tell you how many people<br/>\nI&#39;ve gone out of my way to port lately who have not<br/>\ngiven me a single cp for my trouble. Where have<br/>\neveryone&#39;s manners gone? For all you people out there who do<br/>\npay, I&#39;m sorry you have to listen, but everyone else,<br/>\nshow some respect! Druids and wizards who port you are<br/>\nunder no obligation to do so! It&#39;s a favor they are<br/>\ndoing for you--*especially* if they have to come to<br/>\nyou. I really hate to do it, but it&#39;s gotten so bad<br/>\nlately that I write down names of people who are rude or<br/>\nwon&#39;t pay, and refuse to port them. I also have decided<br/>\nto ask for money before we leave, since my modem is<br/>\nalso slow, and people zone much faster than I do; they<br/>\ncan be on their way and not wait for me. As one of my<br/>\nguildies wisely put is, &quot;You don&#39;t buy your plane tickets<br/>\nafter your flight.&quot;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m done being irate now. I<br/>\napologize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanissa Noryk of Norraths Keepers&lt;br&gt;Serving Tunare for<br/>\n34 seasons!&lt;br&gt;Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
