I guess as a Rogue,<br/>\nno one ever really wants anything from me, so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it&#39;s an issue of not wanting to help<br/>\npeople. I just think of it as more appropriate -- in real<br/>\nlife, people don&#39;t walk around with profession-tags to<br/>\nannounce what they do for a living, so in EQ I prefer to<br/>\nlet people guess. When I pop up out of nowhere, of<br/>\ncourse, that&#39;s usually a clue, as is the puny little<br/>\ndagger (Giant Snake Fang) I use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>\nKaladim&lt;br&gt;11th level rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
