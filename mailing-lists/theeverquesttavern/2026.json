EITHER your<br/>\nWIS or your INT matters in jewelry making, DEPEDING<br/>\non which is higher. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There should be no<br/>\ndifference in difficulty or in skill leveling when using<br/>\nenchanted or unenchanted metals. In my experience, and i&#39;ve<br/>\nread posts to this effect too, Jewelry making has the<br/>\nbest skill level increase per attempt ratio of all<br/>\ntrade skills. Generally, I would gain a skill level at<br/>\nleast every other attempt (sometimes every 3d or 4th<br/>\nattempt, but sometimes 4 attempts in a row would give a<br/>\nskill increase). Failure rate, well that&#39;s another<br/>\nstory-- though i usually only fail consistently when i&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to make items that have a trivial level 20 more<br/>\nthan my skill level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check the sites that show<br/>\naverage prices for selling jewlry items to see what the<br/>\nmarket is and what you should be making. INT and WIS<br/>\nrings sell great at lower levels-- I would make tons<br/>\nand recoup all my costs PLUS some, by selling them<br/>\nfor 5pp (or more). The merchants would only pay me<br/>\n1pp+ for them. BUT there were some rings that didn&#39;t<br/>\nsell well to players (ie. 2AC +4svPoison), but sell to<br/>\nmerchants (5pp in this case). So you CAN make some money<br/>\nback. Once your skill gets up, you can make a bunch of<br/>\nmoney-- i started making WIS earrings-- good money. OH--<br/>\nand make those STR, DEX or AGI rings-- melee guys<br/>\nhave tons of money to give you for them, because<br/>\nthey&#39;re not buying spells--haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mandir the<br/>\nTerrible&lt;br&gt;Tier&#39;Dal Enchanter of the 17th illusion&lt;br&gt;Doing his best<br/>\nto make beautiful jewelry to cover the ugly races of<br/>\nNorrath (no offense you all you Humans)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
