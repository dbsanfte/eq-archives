I recently hit level 37 and if it<br/>\nweren&#39;t for my guildmates, I would have maybe -- all of<br/>\n128 wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to say, I don&#39;t think twink<br/>\nis bad-- but as everyone-- I have a limit on what I<br/>\nbelieve is fair twinking. There&#39;s something to be said<br/>\nabout making it over the &quot;hump&quot; but not to the point of<br/>\ntaking advantage of new players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And finally,<br/>\nabout 12 wis points ago (I&#39;m now at 139 or so)... I was<br/>\nonce told &quot;Did you mean to delete your character--<br/>\nscrap all your equipment-- and then decide not<br/>\nto?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The person was sincere and I didn&#39;t mind too much.<br/>\nHurt for a second though. LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhoo, trust me<br/>\non this one. Knowing the game isn&#39;t affected by<br/>\nhaving or not having. I have a lot more now than before<br/>\nbut nowhere near 170+ wis or a couple hundred plat in<br/>\nthe bank. I have a ton of fun for the most part and<br/>\nplay a good group druid (forget kiting. I can&#39;t kite<br/>\nworth piddling unless I have a chanter).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haven&#39;t<br/>\nplayed this long without getting a ton of kudo&#39;s given<br/>\n-- as well as lessons taken. MUCH taken.<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic... sooo close to<br/>\nmastering Baking *pout*... heh</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
