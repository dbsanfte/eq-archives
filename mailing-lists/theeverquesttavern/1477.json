I always<br/>\ntried to use my imagination when playing MUDs and it<br/>\nreally helped but now that I play EQ I don&#39;t have to<br/>\nbecause anything I can think of for the game in my<br/>\nimagination is already on it or on the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes you do<br/>\nhave to pay $10 a month for it but that comes with<br/>\nover 20 servers to choose from, patches, equipment<br/>\nsaves, and a whole lot of fun. Most people that I&#39;ve run<br/>\ninto on my journeys have said that they would pay more<br/>\nfor what their getting because its so much fun. Plus<br/>\nwhen you play as much as they do the price comes out<br/>\nto less than 1 penny per hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well anyways<br/>\nthats my 2 cents</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
