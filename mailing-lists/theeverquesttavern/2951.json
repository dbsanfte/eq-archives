I played EQ since Beta <br/>\nand quit about 2 and half years ago (college took priority heh) and <br/>\nnow that I have secured a somewhat stable career, I&#39;m planning to hit <br/>\nonline RPGing again. Question is, being that EQ has been out for 5 <br/>\nyears, is it too late to come back and start anew? Meaning am I going <br/>\nto look ridiculous (prolly will regardless) being the only lvl 6 guy <br/>\non the server in cloth and using fine steel? Realistically, I&#39;m <br/>\nassuming after all of these years a large percentage of the players <br/>\nhave either progressed to upper echelon in levels, or populated with <br/>\ntweeked alternates. Should I be looking at another MPORPG like <br/>\nCamelot (a bit more recent)? Suggestions are appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nYager</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
