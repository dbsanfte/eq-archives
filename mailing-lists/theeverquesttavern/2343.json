But Damage: 25 Delay: 40 is a<br/>\nvery nice damage ratio. 1.6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure at later<br/>\nlevel there can be better but... it&#39;s a 1h slash that<br/>\ndeals a hefty punch. I find with Dual wield... I like<br/>\nto have something with a large kick in the primary<br/>\nand something super fast in the secondary. That way<br/>\ndual wield usually activates more (course it&#39;s been a<br/>\nwhile since I&#39;ve played a warrior with dual wield...<br/>\nmaybe they&#39;ve changed it. Egad. Can it really be 2<br/>\nyears ago?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But everyone has a different way of<br/>\nplaying. Wurmslayer also gives you +5 STR, +5 Magic<br/>\nResistance, 5 AC to compensate a bit for it&#39;s heaviness<br/>\nthough. 15 pounds but 5 str to me just means the item is<br/>\nactually 10 pounds and gives you +5 mr and 5 ac to boot<br/>\nwith a 1.6 ratio. Not too shabby till you&#39;re 40 or 45.<br/>\nNot what you&#39;d want to train 1hs...<br/>\nbut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.. forgot to say. I hunted Ice<br/>\nGiants, Cougars, and in OT as well till level 40. Still<br/>\nsometimes hunt some IG&#39;s.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
