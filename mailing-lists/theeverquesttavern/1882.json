But, I<br/>\nthink you still have to compete with my July 19th<br/>\ntwo-part post, and Shooman is also a contender for the<br/>\nlong-post crown . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, on the topic at hand.<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot to be said for the argument that<br/>\n_knowledge_ is twinking. I can no longer start a Dwarf or<br/>\nWood Elf without knowing exactly where to go, who to<br/>\ntalk to and get quests from. I long for the true<br/>\nnewbie days, when you really had no idea what was going<br/>\non, what was around the next corner. That, more than<br/>\nboredom, would be what drives players to a new game such<br/>\nas DAoC, I think. I probably won&#39;t move, however, as<br/>\nI like EQ a lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, what&#39;s a little FS or<br/>\nbronze between friends? On top of that is the twinking<br/>\nhandouts given you by other players. My characters traded<br/>\nbetween them, giving the warrioress a Fine Steel 2H Sword<br/>\n. . . this was after some guy walked out of the<br/>\nbank, said, &quot;Can you use this?&quot; and gave me a Velium<br/>\nShort Sword. Yow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, my attitude toward at<br/>\nleast mild twinking has evidently changed. But if any<br/>\nof you ever catch me with a second level warrior in<br/>\nfull bronze (which I&#39;ve seen), feel free to /rude me<br/>\nand hound me for hypocrisy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht, who has<br/>\nway too much time on his hands at work</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
