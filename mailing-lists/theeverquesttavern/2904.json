Cahlia here, 19th season wood elf druid,<br/>\n&gt; who is trying <br/>\n&gt; desperately to level to 20 and claim my surname<br/>\n&gt; heheh! Oy I hate <br/>\n&gt; taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyhow, I was looking up a quest yesterday and found<br/>\n&gt; one I am <br/>\n&gt; interested in. Starts in Felwithe talking to the<br/>\n&gt; high elf who stands <br/>\n&gt; by the water and tells you he is troubled by his<br/>\n&gt; son&#39;s disappearance, <br/>\n&gt; please talk to someone else. I found that if you go<br/>\n&gt; to Befallen and <br/>\n&gt; kill a skeletal foreman, it will spawn Sir<br/>\n&gt; (something or other starts <br/>\n&gt; with an A). I got the directions, etc. He gives you<br/>\n&gt; a token you take <br/>\n&gt; back and give to the high elf and he gives you his<br/>\n&gt; daughter&#39;s token. <br/>\n&gt; A pretty cool amulet with 3AC, +3wis, +3int, +3 cha,<br/>\n&gt; +3Sta, and +3 <br/>\n&gt; agi I do believe. Anyhow....here&#39;s my question...can<br/>\n&gt; I make it in <br/>\n&gt; Befallen at level 20 ok? I&#39;m scared from what I read<br/>\n&gt; to attempt it. <br/>\n&gt; Apparently everything aggros terribly. EQAtlas says<br/>\n&gt; level 7-25+ mobs, <br/>\n&gt; but since they are all necros and thermagists, the<br/>\n&gt; damages are much <br/>\n&gt; worse than they con. I HATE dying, and I&#39;m too<br/>\n&gt; chicken to attempt <br/>\n&gt; without some feedback. Any suggestions or stories?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; Cahlia<br/>\n&gt; 19th Season,Wood Elf Druid of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Morrel Thule Server<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Fates of Destiny&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nHotJobs - Search new jobs daily now<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/\">http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
