Sometimes their perception of what a<br/>\n&quot;Wizard&quot; or &quot;Monk&quot; is varies quite a bit from what Verant<br/>\nthinks. Then at some point these people realize that<br/>\ntheir class does not live up to what they thought it<br/>\nshould be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, at this point, most people will<br/>\nswitch classes. Some people &quot;stick it out&quot; in the hopes<br/>\nthat their class will somehow get better at higher<br/>\nlevels or that Verant will change the class to meet that<br/>\nplayer&#39;s expectations. I have no remorse for those people.<br/>\nPlaying a character you do not like is foolish. The<br/>\ninstant you figured out you didn&#39;t like your character<br/>\nyou should have switched. I played a Cleric to 14 and<br/>\na Monk to 12 before finding my favorite class<br/>\n(Enchanter). Did I think the Cleric or Monk classes were weak?<br/>\nHell no. I just wasn&#39;t having the playing experience<br/>\nthat I thought I would, and came to the conclusion to<br/>\nswitch characters. I had fun up until the end with those<br/>\ncharacters, so most of my time with them wasn&#39;t really<br/>\nwasted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most common post I see on the various forums goes<br/>\nsomething like this: (very simplified)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Verant said<br/>\n[class] are the masters of [whatever] and they aren&#39;t!<br/>\n[Other class] is way better at at it than we are! I&#39;m<br/>\nlevel [insert high level] so I know what I&#39;m talking<br/>\nabout!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My question is this: Did you finally come to this<br/>\nbrilliant conclusion only AFTER reaching level 50???? It<br/>\ntook you 50 levels to realize you think your class<br/>\n&quot;sucks&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, I&#39;m being excessive with the level 50 example,<br/>\nbut I hope you get my point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another<br/>\npossibility:&lt;br&gt;So you started playing a Rogue let&#39;s say. You get to<br/>\na certain point and it becomes clear that being a<br/>\nRogue is not what you had in mind....but there are no<br/>\nother classes that appeal to you out there. Then I<br/>\nthink you are stuck. Your only options are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)<br/>\nChange your perceptions of Rogues (unlikely)&lt;br&gt;2) Learn<br/>\nto live with the differences in your vision versus<br/>\nVerant&#39;s vision.&lt;br&gt;3) Play another game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of<br/>\nthese people try #2 and can never fully accept the<br/>\ndifferences in vision. They eventually get pissed and either<br/>\nquit or start filling the boards with their heated<br/>\nposts to vent their rage. I feel sorry for these<br/>\npeople, and I hope they eventually find whatever it is<br/>\nthey are looking for in a game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last<br/>\npossible scenario I can think of is nerfs. If you started<br/>\na Necro and enjoyed it all the way to 50 then some<br/>\nnew patch came along with what you think is a<br/>\nhorrible detriment to your class...well that sucks. I can<br/>\nfeel your pain. My only suggestion then would be to<br/>\npost some intelligent requests on why the change<br/>\nshould be revoked or some possible reparations that<br/>\ncould be made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope this is read by people<br/>\nwith an open mind. If even one person out there gains<br/>\nany insight from this post then I feel it was worth<br/>\nthe potential flames.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good journey to you<br/>\nall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
