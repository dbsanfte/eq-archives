Some of my Twink items<br/>\nwere gifts from other players and some were crafted by<br/>\nmy Cleric who had taken up and mastered several<br/>\ntrade skills. Every level I max their skills and most<br/>\nzones they hunt, my cleric has done time in, so I know<br/>\nwhat to expect. I give items out and craft items for<br/>\npeople. To me, it&#39;s a personal choice, if you don&#39;t want<br/>\nto twink, that&#39;s fine. If you do, fine, what matters<br/>\nmore is how you play. Personally, I&#39;d rather see<br/>\nsomeone wearing something they earned even through<br/>\nanother character then to hear the shouts from beggars.<br/>\nBottom Line.....it&#39;s your $10 you pay every month for<br/>\nyour account - you pay for your cable or ISP, play how<br/>\nyou want.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
