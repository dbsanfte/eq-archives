You will<br/>\noften fail with it. You will never be able to see<br/>\nyourself when you Hide, even when you fail. But a good way<br/>\nto tell if it worked is to target an agressive mob,<br/>\nthen Hide. Then /con the mob. If it now /cons<br/>\nindifferent, the Hide worked, otherwise it failed.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This does not apply to all Kunark mobs, since some<br/>\n/cons there are screwed up and many monsters will /con<br/>\nagro to you even though you&#39;re invis, and some of them<br/>\naren&#39;t agro at all. Brutes in Warslik&#39;s Woods for<br/>\nexample. They /con agro, but aren&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this<br/>\nhelps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar Mirraghost&lt;br&gt;30 DE Enchanter</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
