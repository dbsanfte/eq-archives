Best thing to do is to make<br/>\nsure you check all that you buy before hand and to<br/>\nmake sure you have all the PP in the trade box before<br/>\nyou hit trade, and never trust one to give to another<br/>\nunless you take into account the risk. It is called<br/>\nliving on the safe side. Sadly enough we dont live in a<br/>\ncompletely honest world in game or out. Just have fun with<br/>\nthe best parts and take the bad ones as they<br/>\ncome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy hunting all.....;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
