I&#39;m still in just leather<br/>\narmor, can barely scape up enough plat to buy<br/>\nspells...in fact, I&#39;ve still not bought some level 5 spells<br/>\ndue to this fact. But, it requires me to learn the<br/>\ngame by using limited resources wisely...oh, I did<br/>\nplay another druid as my first character and did<br/>\nscrounge 14 gold off of him and a cloth belt and a<br/>\nbackpack before deleting him, but I think most would<br/>\nagree, that&#39;s about like drinking an O&#39;Douls and saying<br/>\nthat you had a beer...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow, the game is<br/>\ngreat. I do enjoy the ROLE-playing aspect of being a<br/>\ndruid...I was even thrilled to be the highest level<br/>\ncharacter in an orc-hill run (I was level 9) and considered<br/>\nthe &quot;TANK&quot; of the group...ha!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take<br/>\ncare,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jim&lt;br&gt;CoJim - Druid of the 10th season, Prexus server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
