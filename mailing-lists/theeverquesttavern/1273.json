One evening I was hunting<br/>\nwooly mammoths in Everfrost plains. I was doing nicely<br/>\nwith one, until one of its buddies decided to help<br/>\nout. So I ran, being the smart druid I am. I scraped<br/>\nthe mammoths off at Bandl McMarrin, he&#39;s such a great<br/>\nguy. And I started to sit down to meditate near him.<br/>\nOops.. I hit the &#39;snare&#39; button, and guess who my target<br/>\nis.. So I run back across the EF plains to zone at<br/>\nPermafrost. Normally the ice giants don&#39;t pay any attention<br/>\nto me, but being the night before a Vox raid, they<br/>\nwere all upset over being hunted. One respawned right<br/>\nas I ran by, and then he proceeded to decimate me<br/>\nwith dual 114 punches, a 25 bash and stun, and another<br/>\nset of punches. Ouch. Too bad Bandl hadn&#39;t been there<br/>\nfor that fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Druid of<br/>\nSpiritus Valorum&lt;br&gt;Tunare&#39;s Chosen of Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
