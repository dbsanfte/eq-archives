Yup you guessed it. I was approved <br/>\nfor a loan for school so now I can afford to either upgrade or buy a <br/>\nwhole new computer! Upgradeing would be cheaper, but buying a whole <br/>\nnew system would be easier. Plus I&#39;ll be able to get all the new toys <br/>\nlike a DVD player and larger hard drive. What do ya&#39;ll think? The <br/>\nRaven    P.S. Oh yeah I have to wait till either the end of this <br/>\nmonth or the middle of next month. *sigh* giving with one hand.....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
