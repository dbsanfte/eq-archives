What are your opinions, experiences,<br/>\nand rants about the new quests? I recently gained the<br/>\nBoots of the Reliant with a level 15 cleric. It was<br/>\nbroing as hell waiting for the items to spawn, and the<br/>\nitem isn&#39;t that great (Stats of plate with +1 AC and<br/>\n+6 against poison) However, it did feel pretty good<br/>\nto do it all on my own, with an lower leel character<br/>\ntoo! Also, the armor is golden plate and looks very<br/>\ncool ;) So, the wuest and items themselves (For<br/>\nclerics, most other classes don&#39;t have it quite so bad)<br/>\nwere dissapointing, but the satisfaction and looks<br/>\nwere good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let everyone know your opinions!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
