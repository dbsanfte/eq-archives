I lean more towards no twinking. Here&#39;s a<br/>\nkinda similar situation-- as a caster, I was in a group<br/>\nthat was a few levels higher than me, taking on MOBs<br/>\nmuch higher than me in Unrest. I could NOT hit a damn<br/>\nthing with my spells-- constantly resisted. It made me<br/>\npretty much worthless in that group. While I was<br/>\ninitially angry, i realized that it, in a way, prevented me<br/>\nfrom &quot;experience twinking&quot; -- just like how EQ doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlet you get experience being in very high groups. I<br/>\nwondered if they could do that with armor/weapons. I mean,<br/>\nI can&#39;t twink and get lvl 30 spells at lvl 5-- why<br/>\nnot have a message that says &quot;you are not experienced<br/>\nenough to use that&quot; when you try to use<br/>\nweapons/armor/itmes that are 5-10 levles beyond you?? Just a<br/>\nthought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as cross-gender chars-- when I started<br/>\nplaying EQ, i noticed a lack of female characters running<br/>\naround. I thought i&#39;d roll play a little and create a<br/>\nfemale gnome. I love the character and her personality,<br/>\nbut OY VEY!!! EQ attracts a horny crowd!!! haha<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone else have comments??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-- i love the<br/>\nthought of the uber twinker getting run down by a pawn!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
