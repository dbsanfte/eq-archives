I finally got the money I was <br/>\nwaiting for so I put my deposit down for the on-campus apartments. It <br/>\nseems that there may be an opening by the end of this month if I want <br/>\nit. (Yah like that&#39;s a question to ask me! Do I want it?! Yup you <br/>\nbetcha!) So keep your fingers crossed that I can actually move on <br/>\ncampus by the end of this month cause if I do...well...I&#39;ll be <br/>\nplaying by the middle of next month. *sigh* the last few weeks are <br/>\nthe hardest to wait for!
