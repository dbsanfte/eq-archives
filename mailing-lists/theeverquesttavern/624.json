Short description","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1317666506\">My friend Mordiki and I headed to Aviak Island<br/>\nlast night in the ocean of Tears. Mordiki is a Ranger,<br/>\nI am an Enchanter, bot level 19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Short<br/>\ndescription of the aviaks on the island:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starlings -<br/>\ngreen, very easy for level 19&lt;br&gt;Turaco - green/blue,<br/>\nfairly easy&lt;br&gt;Tanager - blue/even, ideal&lt;br&gt;Quezatol -<br/>\nusually red, too difficult for just 2 people&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We<br/>\ncould actually have killed a Quezatol, but the danger<br/>\nand resulting downtime were too great to warrant<br/>\nit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once there, we started pulling, but it was difficult<br/>\nbecause another group of 4 players was grabbing all the<br/>\nTuracos and Tanagers. Starlings were giving us crap loot<br/>\nand no exp. And we refused to even try a Quezatol. We<br/>\nhad an escape plan in case we did pull a<br/>\nQuezatol:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Mordiki informs me that doom and destruction is<br/>\nincoming.&lt;br&gt;2) I levitate myself and wait for Mordiki.&lt;br&gt;3) I<br/>\nlevitate him while he&#39;s incoming.&lt;br&gt;4) We take off over<br/>\nthe ocean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, eventually it happened.<br/>\nMordiki pulled a Tanager and a Quezatol spawned in front<br/>\nof him as he was pulling the Tanager back. So we<br/>\nperfectly executed our brilliant plan and took off. Then I<br/>\nswitched views to look behind us, and discovered that the<br/>\ndamn birds were right behind us and standing up, not<br/>\nswimming. It&#39;s as if they were running along the water.<br/>\nThis was bad. Then I realized that I had no clue what<br/>\ndirection we were heading or where the hell we were. This<br/>\nwas really bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mordiki tried casting Ensnare<br/>\non them and I tried Mezzing them, but you cannot<br/>\ncast spells on a monster if it&#39;s in water and you&#39;re<br/>\nnot. We kept running. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Mordiki starts<br/>\ngetting attacked. I thought &quot;How did they catch up to<br/>\nus?&quot;. I look around, and even though I&#39;m running, I&#39;m<br/>\nnot moving forward. We hit the zone border, an<br/>\ninvisible wall in the ocean. This has officially become a<br/>\nnightmare. So let me recap:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have no idea where we<br/>\nare in the ocean.&lt;br&gt;We cannot see land<br/>\nanywhere.&lt;br&gt;We are being attacked by red birds.&lt;br&gt;We cannot<br/>\nrun.&lt;br&gt;I cannot cast spells on the birds.&lt;br&gt;Mordiki is at<br/>\n2 bubbles of health.&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s raining. (couldn&#39;t see<br/>\ncrap)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I cast Rune on Mordiki to keep him alive, then the<br/>\nbirds decide I should die for that. I get pimp slapped<br/>\ndown to 2 bubbles. We break and run. We get separated.<br/>\nI figure it cannot get any worse at this point.<br/>\nLord Nagafen could take a giant dump on me and it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t get any worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the Gods smile upon<br/>\nme...I see land! (I&#39;m agnostic, but whatever) I scream<br/>\nfor Mordiki to track me. He says he has me and is on<br/>\nthe way. I reach land and prepare myself for our last<br/>\nditch effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see him running up with the<br/>\nbirds in close pursuit and I successfully Mez the<br/>\nQuezatol! Then the Tanager that was with him comes running<br/>\nover and starts bitching me. I quickly drop to one<br/>\nbubble. I febbly try to cast a Mez between his hits. I<br/>\nalmost get one off but then he hits me...&quot;You continue<br/>\nyour casting.&quot;...&quot;A Tanager has been enthralled.&quot;<br/>\nWOOHOO! I quickly sit down and memorize Memory blur. My<br/>\nhope is that I can Blur them before they awake. I Blur<br/>\nthe Tanager first by accident. The recycle time on<br/>\nBlur is WAY too long. The Tanager breaks mez and<br/>\nbegins to walk off. I get scared, because I mezzed the<br/>\nTanager SECOND and he&#39;s already broken free from it.<br/>\nMemory Blur cycles. I cast. Quezatol break Mez and<br/>\nrushed me. He is on top of me swinging. &quot;A Quezatol<br/>\nblinks a few times.&quot; He strolls<br/>\noff....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enchanters rule.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
