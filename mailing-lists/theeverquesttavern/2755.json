Especially if you are running EQ <br/>\nwindows and can refer to the web site when needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso someone mentioned not being able to talk to someone on another <br/>\nserver. I thought that to be true too until a few days ago. I <br/>\ndiscovered that you can send tells to ppl on other servers. I can&#39;t <br/>\nremember the command right off... something like /tell [sever]:<br/>\n[character] (exampble /tell Povar:Eressifar) That command may be <br/>\nwrong so don&#39;t hold me to it. You can probably find the command in <br/>\nthe help files.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow a question of my own. I&#39;m a 21 Dark Elf Shadowknight and am new <br/>\nto exploring Kunark. I&#39;m currently bound at the Overthere and am <br/>\nhunting at Lake of Ill Omens. Going from OT to Loio is hard because A <br/>\nLOT of stuff cons red to me. My question is, is there a better place <br/>\nfor me to be bound? And also what is the closest bank to Loio?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help. Feel free to send me a tell at anytime.<br/>\n<br/>\nEressifar Darkheart<br/>\nDark Elf Shadowknight 21 season<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Anyone else playing on Povar?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
