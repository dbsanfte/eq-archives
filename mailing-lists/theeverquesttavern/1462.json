I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t thought about getting to OT through Oasis. I had<br/>\nplanned to make the boring boat trip back to BB, and<br/>\nstart from there to Firiona Vie. Good Advice!! My<br/>\nranger friend and I joined a group last night at the<br/>\nZone ent in Lake Rathe. made it 1/2 way to lvl 19 in<br/>\njust 2 1/2 hours of constant battle. Between loot<br/>\nsplits, I made about 10pp, and also picked up the skull<br/>\nthat gives you +40 mana and +5 Mag resist. (i think --<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember it&#39;s name right now). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aviak<br/>\ngroups were in their low to mid 20s with no room for a<br/>\nstill lvl 18 druid and ranger. We soloed some yellow<br/>\naviaks on the plains of SK, but they hit pretty hard. We<br/>\nhad nearly taken down one yellow, when a red joined<br/>\nin. UGH -- my first time in SK, and I was trying to<br/>\nfind the Lake Rathe zone!!!! Good think I had SOW, and<br/>\ngot a snare off. I waited at the zone to Rathe for my<br/>\nfreind, and then saw an ominous and foreboding message--<br/>\n&quot;Your snare spell has worn off&quot; - TIME TO ZONE!!!!<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This club is pretty good - but i&#39;ve noticed a lot of<br/>\ndruids posting here. We have more/better tales than<br/>\nbards these days!!! Pretty soon, Verant will have to<br/>\nlet us pick of a mandolin!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela (Orcbane or<br/>\nBearFreind or Wolfsire-- can&#39;t decide yet -- hehe)&lt;br&gt;Druid<br/>\nof the 18th Season&lt;br&gt;In the service of Mother<br/>\nTunare, on Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
