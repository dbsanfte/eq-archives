I<br/>\nmerely put a logical reason why no one should buy them.<br/>\nThe dangers of someone not knowing how to survive in<br/>\na level 52 PvP environment is tremendous.&lt;br&gt;On a<br/>\nside note: Why put so much time into something and<br/>\nthen just give it up?&lt;br&gt;And to anyone considering it:<br/>\nfor your own safety... ask for a detailed list of<br/>\nevery item the characters have, what factions may have<br/>\nbeen severly hampered (i.e. did he kill a bunch of<br/>\ndwarfs making Thurgadin off limits?), if you have an<br/>\naccount ask to inspect the individual characters. Be<br/>\nthourough. Be a smart buyer (like buying accounts<br/>\nqualifies...)&lt;br&gt;And on another side note: I am ashamed of you! Both<br/>\nthe buyer and the seller. Playing a paladin, knight<br/>\nof honor indeed.. pfff.... &lt;br&gt;And if someone is<br/>\ntrying to tell me that it won&#39;t happen, it probably will<br/>\nand I know it... but I feel that is my duty to<br/>\nwithhold the honor and the integrity of EQ and Norrath<br/>\nitself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
