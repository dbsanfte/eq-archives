It is not wise to try to force your way into a<br/>\ngroup of society that wishes nothing to do with you,<br/>\nbecause it only provokes social anxiety.

The<br/>\n&gt; reason given for <br/>\n&gt; the request by the FAITH Copy Editor was both<br/>\n&gt; ignorant and <br/>\n&gt; discriminatory. &quot;The Salisbury Post FAITH section is<br/>\n&gt; for people who <br/>\n&gt; believe in God&quot; and &quot;this is not the image that The<br/>\n&gt; Post wants to <br/>\n&gt; portray.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Salisbury Post&#39;s mission statement says in part:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;We are a marketing and customer driven company<br/>\n&gt; whose mission is to <br/>\n&gt; inform, educate and entertain. We strive to mirror<br/>\n&gt; the unique <br/>\n&gt; communities we serve and offer responsible public<br/>\n&gt; forum.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We fail to see how denying a Pagan/Wiccan study<br/>\n&gt; group an equal space <br/>\n&gt; with other congregations fulfills this mission<br/>\n&gt; statement. The <br/>\n&gt; decision was made with personal prejudices and not<br/>\n&gt; handled with a <br/>\n&gt; professional demeanor. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regardless of whether or not Paganism is The<br/>\n&gt; Salisbury Post&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; religion, it is our religion. The Federal Government<br/>\n&gt; recognizes <br/>\n&gt; Paganism/Wicca, as an official religion. Military<br/>\n&gt; Courts of Justice <br/>\n&gt; in the U.S. have also found Wicca to be a valid<br/>\n&gt; religion, deserving <br/>\n&gt; of protection under the First Amendment of the U.S.<br/>\n&gt; Constitution. In <br/>\n&gt; the case United States v. Phillips, (42 M.J. 346) in<br/>\n&gt; 1995) the <br/>\n&gt; concurring opinion by Judge Wiss stated: &quot;First,<br/>\n&gt; Wicca is a socially <br/>\n&gt; recognized religion. It is acknowledged as such by<br/>\n&gt; the Army. <br/>\n&gt; See `Dept. of the Army (DA) Pamphlet 165-13-1,<br/>\n&gt; Religious Requirements <br/>\n&gt; and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook<br/>\n&gt; for Chaplains&#39; <br/>\n&gt; (April 1980), revising A Pamphlet 165-13, `Religious<br/>\n&gt; Requirements and <br/>\n&gt; Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for<br/>\n&gt; Chaplains&#39; <br/>\n&gt; (April 1978). Further, it is acknowledged as such in<br/>\n&gt; courts of law.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pagans and Wiccans are a part of your community. We<br/>\n&gt; are your <br/>\n&gt; neighbors, your coworkers, your children&#39;s teachers;<br/>\n&gt; we are <br/>\n&gt; professionals, but most importantly we are your<br/>\n&gt; readers - your <br/>\n&gt; customers! As engraved on your building and<br/>\n&gt; imprinted on the <br/>\n&gt; Opinion/Editorial page of the paper &quot;The truth shall<br/>\n&gt; make you free&quot;; <br/>\n&gt; misconceptions about pagans, and being denied access<br/>\n&gt; to public forum <br/>\n&gt; makes it all the more difficult for the truth to<br/>\n&gt; make any of us free. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Due to the fact that this request was handled in an<br/>\n&gt; unprofessional <br/>\n&gt; manner and with personal bigotry, we, the<br/>\n&gt; undersigned, as well as <br/>\n&gt; members of our family and friends, who are both of<br/>\n&gt; the Christian and <br/>\n&gt; Pagan faith will not support The Salisbury Post. We<br/>\n&gt; will no longer be <br/>\n&gt; a part of your readership until this matter is<br/>\n&gt; reconciled with a <br/>\n&gt; formal apology and the list is made public in The<br/>\n&gt; Salisbury Post. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;We are not evil. We don&#39;t harm or seduce people. We<br/>\n&gt; are not <br/>\n&gt; dangerous. We are ordinary people like you. We have<br/>\n&gt; families, jobs, <br/>\n&gt; hopes, and dreams. We are not a cult. This religion<br/>\n&gt; is not a joke. We <br/>\n&gt; are not what you think we are from looking at T.V.<br/>\n&gt; We are real. We <br/>\n&gt; laugh, we cry. We are serious. We have a sense of<br/>\n&gt; humor. You don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; have to be afraid of us. We don&#39;t want to convert<br/>\n&gt; you. And please <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t try to convert us. Just give us the same right<br/>\n&gt; we give you--to <br/>\n&gt; live in peace. We are much more similar to you than<br/>\n&gt; you think.&quot; - <br/>\n&gt; Margot Adler <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sincerely, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Undersigned <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.petitiononline.com/MMoon/\">http://www.petitiononline.com/MMoon/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Love & Blessings!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mari<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.yahoo.com/magickal_mari\">http://profiles.yahoo.com/magickal_mari</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
