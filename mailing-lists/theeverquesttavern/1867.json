Not huge leaps like<br/>\nthe 200 int caster some talk about. I am talking<br/>\nminor twinks...like starting a new character with maybe<br/>\n10pp. You know, enough to buy basic equipment right<br/>\nfrom the start. First level spells for instance..maybe<br/>\nbasic armor and weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just recently started<br/>\nplaying EQ so no self twinking yet. However, I have been<br/>\ngiven items and money from high level characters...is<br/>\nthis considered twinking? Someone doing something nice<br/>\njust because they could? I am not sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t know if i would twink myself..the game is<br/>\njust too darn fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calidiel Shapeshyfter 20th<br/>\nseason chanter...rodcet nife sever</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
