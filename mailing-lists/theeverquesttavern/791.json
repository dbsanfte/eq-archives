Also<br/>\nbecause the posts from Gordon and Brad are on there so i<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to read the damned Flameplayboard.. erm oop<br/>\nsorry ment Gameplay :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I further use Everlore<br/>\nbecuase of a couple of good guides they have on Trade<br/>\nskills and on Quest, Yes you are right they can be<br/>\nfrustrating and confusing with people asking the same<br/>\nquestions over and over. But sometimes it&#39;s a nice read<br/>\ntoo. (Fire pot &quot;quest&quot;)&lt;br&gt;I also use it before I buy<br/>\nmy new spell to check wath they do and what the best<br/>\n(player submited tacticts are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maximumeq, Yes I<br/>\nalso use it to check for prices and because they have<br/>\neverything crossreferred.. Making looking for class or race<br/>\nspecific armor/weapons a breeze.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQvault, Mainly<br/>\nfor if I want to read player fiction stories, and<br/>\nview player submited art (used to draw a lot myself).<br/>\nIt also is the first site i go to if I can&#39;t log<br/>\ninto Everquest as it has a serverstatus list dead<br/>\nsmack on the front page, so i can see if the servers a<br/>\nre down or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh and I&#39;d like to come here<br/>\nofcourse and babbel a bit about nothing of grave<br/>\nimportance :P</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
