You do<br/>\nnot begin to lose XP until 6th level. As it is, you<br/>\ncan&#39;t drop below 6th level. That would mean XP loss in<br/>\nthe 5th level, which is impossible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Skills<br/>\nare only &quot;lost&quot; if you drop more than two levels. For<br/>\ninstance, someone &quot;delevels&quot; (attacks a high level mob over<br/>\nand over, dying over and over, and losing XP over and<br/>\nover until they drop in level) from 54 to 26. Their<br/>\nskills drop until they using them at the max of 28th<br/>\nlevel. However, when that person regains 27, their skill<br/>\nautomatically jumps to the max of 29. This will continue until<br/>\nthey&#39;ve regained the level they originally<br/>\nlost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Healing, buffing, or otherwise casting beneficial<br/>\nspells on ANY mobs does NOT work. Healing a wolf while<br/>\nsome newbie is fighting it might scare them off, but<br/>\nin reality it isn&#39;t doing anything at all. This was<br/>\nput into place to prevent both XP kills and to keep<br/>\nhigh level characters from buffing out Orc Pawns and<br/>\nwatching them murder newbies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. There are RUMORS<br/>\nof hidden faction when killing bears or wolves, but<br/>\nthey are just that. Rumors. I&#39;ve killed hundreds of<br/>\nbears AND wolves, as a ranger, and my faction with<br/>\nJaggedpine Treefolk and such hasn&#39;t changed a<br/>\nbit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this clears a few things up for you<br/>\nall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral Stormfang&lt;br&gt;Captain of the Knights of<br/>\nProphecy&lt;br&gt;Lanys T&#39;Vyl</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
