It is a terrific druid only site. In the messages <br/>\nboards they have sticky post about where to hunt at your general lvl. <br/>\nNot for sure but at 41 i think i was quadding snow cougers in ice <br/>\nclad or maybe the specs in oasis. After them i went to timoruos deep <br/>\nand started quadding spirocs. That took me to all the way to 51 xp <br/>\nslows down at about 50 51 on the spirocs but i know can take you to <br/>\n52 as i am about to ding it there. Or you can start trying the <br/>\nraptors in that same zone also. I havent tried them yet but read that <br/>\nit can be done. If you want to make some money and xp head to cobalt <br/>\nscar and quad the wyverns. Save the pelts and sell them in bazaar and <br/>\nsell the gems to vendors for about 40plat. This is a bit more <br/>\ndangerous and harder as there is always people there farming. Unless <br/>\nyou have killed alot of giants in velious and raised your claws of <br/>\nveeshan <br/>\nfaction you will be kos to the drakes there and they cast on you for <br/>\nlike 300 dam. Do not pull the named wyvern he cannot be slowed or <br/>\nsnared. As far as the wis items i just went to bazaar and filled in <br/>\nthe filters one of them you can pick wis and all wis items will come <br/>\nup then just shop away. It will be slow quadding till you get your <br/>\nnew aoe spell lightnig blast and lvl 45 when you can get kei then its <br/>\nsmooth sailing to 51. Oh there is a good quest wis book you can hold <br/>\nin your off hand adss like 10 wis and somethin other would be easy to <br/>\nobtain at you lvl. Sorry but i forgot the name of it next time im on <br/>\nill check but can prolly find it on the druid site.<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theeverquesttavern@yahoogroups.com\">theeverquesttavern@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sue &lt;kstiggermom@y...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ** sigh **<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I guess I&#39;m the loner.
