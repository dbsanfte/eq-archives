He<br/>\ncharges roughly $400 I think. There are some advantages<br/>\nto this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You get exactly the<br/>\nname/race/class/server you want.&lt;br&gt;You don&#39;t have to worry about your<br/>\ncharacter&#39;s reputation.&lt;br&gt;You can still have the fun of<br/>\ngetting any items you want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, for $400<br/>\nyou could just buy a level 40ish character already<br/>\nstacked with items. I&#39;m just letting you know of this<br/>\npossible alternative if you&#39;re interested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope you<br/>\nfind what you&#39;re looking<br/>\nfor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
