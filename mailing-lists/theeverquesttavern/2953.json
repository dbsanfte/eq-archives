I played EQ since Beta<br/>\nand quit about 2 and half years ago (college took priority heh) and<br/>\nnow that I have secured a somewhat stable career, I&#39;m planning to hit<br/>\nonline RPGing again. Question is, being that EQ has been out for 5<br/>\nyears, is it too late to come back and start anew? Meaning am I going<br/>\nto look ridiculous (prolly will regardless) being the only lvl 6 guy<br/>\non the server in cloth and using fine steel? Realistically, I&#39;m<br/>\nassuming after all of these years a large percentage of the players<br/>\nhave either progressed to upper echelon in levels, or populated with<br/>\ntweeked alternates. Should I be looking at another MPORPG like<br/>\nCamelot (a bit more recent)? Suggestions are appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nYager<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theeverquesttavern-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">theeverquesttavern-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
