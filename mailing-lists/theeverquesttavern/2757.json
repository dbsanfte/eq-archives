But with the right help I see no reason you could not get it lots earlier. A lot of the things you can do at your level others you need help no matter what level. The clicky doesn&#39;t go into affect till you hit 50 but it is still a great weapon.<br/>\nAs for financing Alchemy...when Nukim was young he stayed at the entrance to Guk and sold IVU and Shrink potions but Guk is not as popular now as it was. I would imagine selling SOW is the way to go now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Claude P Perry II <br/>\n  To: theeverquesttavern@yahoogroups.com <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, September 12, 2002 9:58 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [The EverQuest Tavern] Greetings<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hail and Well met Kamorm,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a 32 Barb Shammy and I am wondering when can I start my Epic?

My crowning<br/>\n  &gt; achievement so far (150 days played, cause I love to &#39;smell the<br/>\n  &gt; flowers&#39;) is lvl 60 epiced shaman with complete spellbook<br/>\n  &gt; (no &#39;Ancient Scrolls&#39; yet) and 25 AA pts. Even after playing EQ for<br/>\n  &gt; this amount of time there is so much I am unfamiliar with, mostly the<br/>\n  &gt; old world, feel like newbie often :)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I do however have humble knowledge of the Barbarian Shaman class, the<br/>\n  &gt; continent of Antonica and many of the kunark and velious zones. I<br/>\n  &gt; hang out mostly in luclin zones atm. I belong to a smallish guild (60<br/>\n  &gt; members) that I have been in for 2 years (since early 30&#39;s) we are<br/>\n  &gt; just now approaching some of the higher end encounters.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I know I will learn from you folks and hopefully be able to<br/>\n  &gt; contribute in some humble manner.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Kamorm Winterstalker<br/>\n  &gt; Oralce of Coinfist<br/>\n  &gt; Innoruuk Server<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n  Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n  Version: 6.0.385 / Virus Database: 217 - Release Date: 9/4/02<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
