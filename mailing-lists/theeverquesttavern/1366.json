I<br/>\nknow very little about dungeons and have been killing<br/>\nat the Aviaks. Loot there is good but looking for<br/>\ngood items and exp that drop in dungeons now.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m a level 23 druid that gets most play in on Tues<br/>\nand Thurs about 4 or 5 pm to 10pm at night. That&#39;s<br/>\nCST since I&#39;m in Texas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>\nout&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... CST.. Chapter Story Teller. There&#39;s my LARPer<br/>\nside popping out again. Grin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>\nPrismatic, Drinal Server of the 23rd-- looking forward to<br/>\nlevel 24 spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS... sorry EQrogue. Would<br/>\nlove to group with the backstabbing vixen female<br/>\nrogues that are around. =) But yes... on Drinal. =/<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPPS EQ and flirting. Evilly addicting. I had a poor<br/>\ngirl asking me if I were a female or a man once<br/>\nthough. I play a male wood elf. Sadly enough, I was<br/>\nflattered. Usually ppl just ask me if I&#39;m gay. LOL. My<br/>\nanswer to them is -- what wood elf isn&#39;t of the merriest<br/>\nof spirit when prowling through the forest<br/>\nprismatic???</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
