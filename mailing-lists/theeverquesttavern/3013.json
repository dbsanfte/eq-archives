There are many places that these charges could come from, and before blaming eBay, maybe you should check an itemized statement.  There is also the possibilty that they are charging you mistakingly for an auction that was not yours.  Not saying that this wasn&#39;t there fault, but I think you need to check all the information before you start saying that they are evil.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\t-----Original Message----- \r<br/>\n\tFrom: Beverly [mailto:beverlyreed2002@...] \r<br/>\n\tSent: Fri 5/16/2003 4:15 PM \r<br/>\n\tTo: theeverquesttavern@yahoogroups.com \r<br/>\n\tCc: \r<br/>\n\tSubject: RE: [The EverQuest Tavern] EBAY &quot;Ripped Me Off&quot;\r<br/>\n\t\r<br/>\n\t\r<br/>\n\tI figured someone needs to speak up or these people will continue to bend people over, abuse their right to mark credit reports, and mischrage people knowing they &quot;have to&quot; pay it. There is no way to contact an actual person, email customer service, or an address! In other words they built a wall to protect themselves. I don&#39;t have the money to pay them either. I was expecting the $15 not what they have on their records! What am I suppose to do? File bankruptcy so they don&#39;t screw me in the future I have set for myself to &quot;MAYBE&quot; save money, build credit, and buy a house someday where there aren&#39;t neighbors from hell, that their apartment smells so bad that it literally burns my nose, but a manager that &quot;won&#39;t&quot; actually do anything... I thought that if I was a &quot;good&quot; girl, kept to myself, and worked hard life or BULLY COMPANIES LIKE EBAY wouldn&#39;t keep bending me over... anyone have some spare KY Jelly?\r<br/>\n\t\r<br/>\n\t\r<br/>\n\t\r<br/>\n\t._.~*~._.~*~.Beverly R._.~*~._.~*~.\r<br/>\n\t\r<br/>\n\tP.O.
