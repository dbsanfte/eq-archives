Awesome huh? <br/>\nAnyway, started going about getting the stuff to up-grade my comp. I <br/>\nhave the sound card, and SOL, so now all&#39;s I need is the vid card and <br/>\nsome memory. I asked my cousin (he&#39;s a comp wiz. works for Compac <br/>\ntoo) and he gave me the names of some stores that I can bug here in <br/>\nHouston. Soooo...I figure end of next month? I should be playing <br/>\nagain. Ok so here is the question I have for up-grading the comp. <br/>\nWill just the mem, vid and sound up-grade be enough if I have a pen <br/>\n2? (at this time I can only afford to up-grade that stuff versus a <br/>\nwhole new mother board.) The Raven P.S. I&#39;m thinking Rayvin for a <br/>\nname. Sound ok?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
