I know that<br/>\nsome like KC, and Velk&#39;s is a very popular place.<br/>\nCobalt Shrine seems popular for its non-named dragons as<br/>\nwell (b/c named ones give faction hits).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those<br/>\nare all interesting places. Ppl in my guild that are<br/>\n50+ I believe are Kala, Arso, Waubau, Bubila, Barrio<br/>\nand a few others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also have this tendency<br/>\nfor our Enchanters to rise far and above the speed<br/>\nthat any other class goes up. So even though our<br/>\nchanters are now 43-- if they are like Valayna and<br/>\nAndarvi, they shall rise up about a level every few days<br/>\ntill they hit 50 in about two or three<br/>\nmonths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just some general tips for the Necro on Drinal server.<br/>\nPlus check out UGOD (United Guilds of Drinal). I would<br/>\nalso highly suggest visiting guild websites and posts.<br/>\nAlways good suggestions there. I go to my guild&#39;s boards<br/>\nat<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub73.ezboard.com/btribunal58632\">http://pub73.ezboard.com/btribunal58632</a> target=new&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub73.ezboard.com/btribunal58632&lt;/a\">http://pub73.ezboard.com/btribunal58632&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Soulbonded (one of 4 Guilds in the Drinal<br/>\nAlliance):&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub28.ezboard.com/bsoulbonded71563\">http://pub28.ezboard.com/bsoulbonded71563</a> target=new&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub28.ezboard.com/bsoulbonded71563&lt;/a\">http://pub28.ezboard.com/bsoulbonded71563&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would also highly suggest checking with your<br/>\nguild. Whenever I get stumped about Exp or go into a<br/>\nslump-- usually Guild or friends on my whois list are the<br/>\nfirst to pull me out of hard spots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave a guild, then I would highly suggest getting one.<br/>\nI love my own guild, Tribunal of Antiquity. So I<br/>\nhave to suggest my own. Problem is-- we no longer have<br/>\nanyone one as high as 54+ as they left to more uber<br/>\nguilds. We&#39;re a good family group though. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of<br/>\nthem are in Guardians of the Keep so they must be<br/>\npretty decent. I would also highly recommend Soulbonded<br/>\nas their guild leader rocks and their boards are<br/>\ngood and decent number are around 54+ so you could get<br/>\ngood groups easily. Probably do a few Kael raids and<br/>\nPoH etc raids with them or the Drinal Alliance. All<br/>\nthe Drinal Alliance ppl have really good reps. White<br/>\nWind, Silver Hawks, Soul Bonded, Phoenix<br/>\nOrder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic of the Drinal server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
