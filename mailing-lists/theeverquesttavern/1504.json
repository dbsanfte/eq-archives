I am<br/>\nalso a teacher and a professional consultant who gives<br/>\npresentations for a living. My point was not to use too many,<br/>\nnot that they shouldn&#39;t be used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea of<br/>\nhaving a &quot;unique&quot; visual aid is a good one, just don&#39;t<br/>\nspend all your five minutes trying to pull everyone&#39;s<br/>\nattention away from your hand-outs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You want the<br/>\naudience to listen to you, not focus on something you gave<br/>\nthem. Whatever visual aids you use, they should not<br/>\ndistract the audience from what you are saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The<br/>\nwonderful thing about opinions is that pretty much everyone<br/>\nhas one. It was a great idea to solicit ideas on a<br/>\nmessage board. You will probably learn as much from that<br/>\nas from giving the presentation! RELAX, HAVE FUN and<br/>\nGOOD LUCK! ;-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
