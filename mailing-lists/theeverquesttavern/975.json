Bash and<br/>\nkick do share the same timer, though, so if you&#39;re<br/>\nusing bash, you won&#39;t be able to kick until the bash<br/>\ntimer runs out, and vice versa. So you&#39;ll be able to<br/>\nbash and utilize the benefits of a second weapon; in<br/>\nthis case, a 10/40<br/>\npiercer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. - In your off hand, I would recommend another<br/>\nlangseax, if not better. Langseaxes are cheap, effective<br/>\nweapons that can last for quite a long time. The extra ac<br/>\non a SOTSU is nice, but it&#39;s rather expensive for<br/>\nit&#39;s time, and it might be better to save that money<br/>\nfor another weapon or some crafted. Don&#39;t be afraid<br/>\nto use it if you get it free, etc.; it&#39;s not bad.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
