One of those groups where nobody knows what<br/>\nthey&#39;re doing? &lt;br&gt;Sigh had it happen last night we<br/>\nstarted out great. Xaiver Human Shadow Knight and by now<br/>\na friend and daily hunting partner Zorbdak the best<br/>\nlitle kick ass halfling druid I ever had the pleausure<br/>\nto group with and Ltle old me. We met up with a<br/>\nranger and i thouhg great we have a good puller here...<br/>\nBut that turned out wrong. we where then in a chaos<br/>\ngroup. Everybody just pulled something and I still<br/>\nhaven&#39;t forgiven Xaiver for pulling a Deepwater croc in<br/>\nOasis. Ha well he died I barly made it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We went<br/>\nback to North Ro to check derv camps as usual ofcourse<br/>\nthey where all camped. Butt at camp 2 where 2 people<br/>\nin that group I&#39;d grouped with before. So I went<br/>\nover and ask nicley if they would very much would mind<br/>\nsharing the spawn... (yes we Dark Elfs can play nice too)<br/>\nThat wasn&#39;t a problem and for a moment the old magic<br/>\nwas back. We got a Wiz and Pally in aswell at this<br/>\ntime and Dervs had litle on us... Until Zorbdak had to<br/>\nlog...the ranger lost connection and the wiz ran of all the<br/>\ntime to go and sell/buy stuff at the plat, getting<br/>\nhimself killed in getting there twice. In the meantime<br/>\nthe Pally just refused to do anything but<br/>\ntank...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So there we are 2 shadow knights and a paladin...<br/>\nSure we can take out a derv at a time but it just<br/>\ncosts us to much and sometimes you pull several at<br/>\nonce.. and hey what about those casters?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get a healer Xaiver and I stormed the camp out of<br/>\npure frustration when the other group was selling. We<br/>\nhad four dervs on us. We got them ll with the two of<br/>\nus (Pally was afk). And it did feel rather nice ;-)<br/>\nbut I had 2 bubbles health left and Xaiver had 3 and<br/>\nsitting on your bumm all the time to heal up is not my<br/>\nidea of fun.&lt;br&gt;I ended up getting frustated and<br/>\nXaiver was too. So I made up an excuse and left. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t even want to play anymore so I logged. All in all<br/>\none of my worst days in Norath :(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
