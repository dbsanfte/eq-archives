I would not<br/>\nfeel guilty about consolidating my items and money to<br/>\none character. I quite often transfer funds and items<br/>\nbetween them as it is. I see my characters as a group of<br/>\nfriends who give/loan stuff to each other. Now granted,<br/>\nI&#39;m not a single digit level toon running around in<br/>\nplane gear, but my bard does have 3 pieces of lambent<br/>\nand she&#39;s just 21. &lt;br&gt;To me, minor twinking (fs<br/>\nweapon, something not outrageous) is ok. Think of it as<br/>\nfriends looking out for each other. However, level 3<br/>\nbards with full lambentor singing steel (I have seen<br/>\nthem!) running for their lives from orc pawns are<br/>\nridiculous. I&#39;ve had level 3 warriors with wurmslayers and<br/>\nbetter gear than my 25th warrior asking me for stuff. I<br/>\nhad one guy trying to impress me with the fact that<br/>\nhe had spent 13k for a robe for his level 6 caster.<br/>\nA fool and his money..... My rambling is now over.<br/>\nSorry for any stress it causes!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kei&lt;br&gt;Frehley,<br/>\nMaeter on Brell&lt;br&gt;Emereldas, Keiyuki, Keiyuri on Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
