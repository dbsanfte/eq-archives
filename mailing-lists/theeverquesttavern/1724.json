I have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1335527149\">Just thought I&#39;d like to share my favorite<br/>\nhunting grounds, as well as hear from some others about<br/>\nthey places they frequest for XP and loot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>\nhave discovered the joys of the Warrens. Besides being<br/>\nrelatively quiet, with rarely more than a half dozen people<br/>\nthere, you can safely hunt there, even solo, from about<br/>\nlevel 7 to 30. Being a dungeon, you recieve an XP bonus<br/>\nthere as well. And the faction CAN NOT be beat. You<br/>\nonly lose faction with the kobolds themselves, while<br/>\ngaining faction with both the Heretics and the good<br/>\nErudites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only that, but the loot tables there are off the<br/>\ncharts. A mid-teen character can easily make 150pp+ in a<br/>\nday&#39;s worth of fighting there. Bronze weapons drop like<br/>\nmad, so does cash. Better items when you reach around<br/>\n20-25 drop off of the named mobs. Crown, Scepter,<br/>\nCloak, etc. of the Forlorn, lots of class-specific<br/>\nitems, and some pretty decent armor, both Cold Iron and<br/>\nSoft Wicker, drop throughout the zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best<br/>\nclasses to bring in there are probably monks, shaman,<br/>\nwarriors, shadowknights, necros, or really any true<br/>\ncasters. Lots of INT items in there, as well as mana<br/>\nboosting and WIS items. There are also quests in the<br/>\nWarrens specifically for Heretics and Paladins from<br/>\nErudin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only downside of the zone is the random spawns of mobs<br/>\nwho are a bit TOO high for younger characters to<br/>\nhandle. Twice last night we had to zone because something<br/>\nwandered up to us that was at least 5 levels higher and<br/>\nresisted nearly all our spells. Other than that, not too<br/>\nmany problems. Even the pathing in there is pretty<br/>\npredictable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and farmers/loot whores shouldn&#39;t bother going:<br/>\nif you&#39;re too high level to get XP, or the creature<br/>\nyou killed was FAR too easy for your group, you don&#39;t<br/>\nget to loot the rare drops that creature might<br/>\nhave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&#39;s hear YOUR fave place to hunt. What do you like<br/>\nabout it? Where&#39;s it at? Some tips for newcomers?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
