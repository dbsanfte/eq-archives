It&#39;s amazing how<br/>\none day can screw up your life.....<br/>\n<br/>\n  It all started this morning.  I woke up at 5am due<br/>\nto my Mom&#39;s friends (yes I still live with my Mom) <br/>\nnext I hung around the mall to chew up some time until<br/>\nmy date tonight.  So, After that I went to the leasing<br/>\noffice of the new apartment I am moving into...  My<br/>\ncredit was sour, and I&#39;ll end up having to pay 1130$<br/>\nby next friday for a deposit on the apartment.  So, I<br/>\nwent to work to volenteer some extra time.  I worked<br/>\nfor 2 hours and got canned for not making $300 in that<br/>\ntime...  Yes, I got CANNED. I lost my job.  So, then I<br/>\nleft there stopped at my date&#39;s place of work.  And,<br/>\nwho do I see there?  Her ex.....  and, so, as she was<br/>\nwalking out I pulled her off to the side and come to<br/>\nfind out, the two of them had gotten back together 2<br/>\ndays ago right after I asked her out.....  And, she<br/>\nwas gonna leave me high and dry at the restaurant....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nand, THAT is why it is gonna take me longer to get on<br/>\nEQ than I thought. =(<br/>\n<br/>\n  Later all, (depressed)PsyKo<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
