They<br/>\ncan outdamage other tanks and since have virtuall no<br/>\narmor they can taunt monsters onto them, which means<br/>\ndeath. Unless they are grouped with a warrior that knows<br/>\nto pull stuff off them, they need to communicate<br/>\ntheir role to the group. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also they can be a<br/>\npain for healers because they are taking too much<br/>\ndamage or just die fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Players who know how to<br/>\nplay the class well really shine, and I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nseveral outstanding monks, and a bunch of really bad<br/>\nones. For that reason the class is never going to be<br/>\nreally popular. It&#39;s a good idea to work on your<br/>\nthrowing kill, so you can pull &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You also need good<br/>\nfriend to hold your loot for you since you can&#39;t carry<br/>\nmore than 15 lbs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the upside there aren&#39;t<br/>\ntoo many classes you can outfit so<br/>\ncheaply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, at high levels they are favored as pullers and<br/>\nalmost required for really hard places like the planes.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
