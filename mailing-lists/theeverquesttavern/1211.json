I remember when I first fiddled with<br/>\nGamma. And even if it doesn&#39;t help anyone-- it at least<br/>\nreminds of us stuff-- like how I need to go in and tweak<br/>\nmy colors some more so that I can read text in both<br/>\nspell med and full screen modes. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also<br/>\nreminds me that many ppl don&#39;t know that they can remap<br/>\nall the keys. Got a friend whome functions almost<br/>\nfully on just the numpad and uses the left hand<br/>\nentirely to target party members and drop down to cast<br/>\nspells.&lt;br&gt;(Tempted to remap inventory and use item myself&lt;br&gt;so that<br/>\nI could come close to that.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve remapped<br/>\nmy auto attack to the ` key. That&#39;s been SUCH a life<br/>\nsaver. I know ppl that remap the key to &#39;z&#39; but I just<br/>\nhit z by accident too much or know too many ppl with<br/>\nz in their names. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS...<br/>\nI&#39;ve discovered Begging is a TOUGH trade skill to get<br/>\nto go up... =).
