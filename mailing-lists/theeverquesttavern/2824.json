Find out what faction your <br/>\nguild is on, Claws of Veeshan or Kael Drakkal. If they&#39;re on CoV, <br/>\nyou can raise your faction with the giants in Great Divide. If <br/>\nthey&#39;re on Kael faction, then kill the Coldain in GD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure on the other two questions though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSucrecian Azuretank, 46th Warrior<br/>\nTahksan Rayleaf, 52nd Druid<br/>\nProud Members of Keepers of Life<br/>\nVeeshan Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
