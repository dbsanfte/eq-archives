There&#39;s evidently a limit on the <br/>\nsize of messages posted here, but they don&#39;t tell you that, and then <br/>\ndon&#39;t post the message if it&#39;s too large.  This is my third try to <br/>\npost this, so let me break it up.  Heaven forbid we ask people to <br/>\nread too much at once, hey?<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, let&#39;s see what we can do here.  First thing, if you haven&#39;t <br/>\nalready, you should visit the official EQ Tech Support page: go to <br/>\nhttp://eqlive.station.sony.com, click on Technical Help on the left.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, your processor.  A Pentium II 200 MHz will not cut it, so that <br/>\nwould be the basic problem.  Your RAM should come in 64 or 32 MB <br/>\nincrements, so you probably have 128, 192, or 256 MB.  You could have <br/>\n224, but that would be an odd amount; if it&#39;s cobbled together using <br/>\ndifferent kinds of RAM, that could also be a problem (but not one <br/>\nthat would prevent you from running EQ).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 256 MB of RAM, if you&#39;re running the Luclin expansion, you will <br/>\nonly be able to use about half the new models.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWin NT and Linux are different operating systems - you probably have <br/>\nWindows 95, 98, or XP.  I hope you have Windows 98, because Windows <br/>\n95 does not support DirectX 8.1, which you need to run the new <br/>\ngraphics engine.  That could be your basic problem, either that or <br/>\nthe processor.<br/>\n<br/>\nRequired specs, from the Official Sony page:<br/>\n<br/>\nWindows┬« 98/2000/ME/XP  &lt;---- Need to check this.<br/>\nPentium┬« II 400Mhz or greater &lt;----------------<br/>\n256 MB RAM <br/>\n16 MB Direct3D compliant video card  &lt;--- Your card is fine.<br/>\nDirectX 8.0 compatible sound card  &lt;------ ??<br/>\n28.8k (or faster) Internet connection <br/>\n4X speed CD-ROM <br/>\n450 MB+ hard drive space  &lt;---- HD is OK, unless you&#39;ve already <br/>\nfilled it with stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: Although technically below the minimum specs, players with 128 <br/>\nMB of RAM will still be able to run Luclin by turning off the new <br/>\ncharacter models. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecommended Specs:<br/>\n<br/>\nWindows┬« 98/2000/ME/XP <br/>\nPentium┬« III or greater <br/>\n512 MB RAM <br/>\n32 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&L (i.e. ATI Radeon <br/>\nor Nvidia GeForce 2 or greater) <br/>\nDirectX 8.0 compatible sound card <br/>\n56.6k (or faster) Internet connection <br/>\n16X speed CD-ROM <br/>\n1.5 GB+ hard drive space<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: DirectX 8.1 or greater is required for Windows 98 ,XP, ME, and <br/>\n2k. <br/>\n<br/>\nSee next section.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
