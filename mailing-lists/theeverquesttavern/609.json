Cazic is a big time train<br/>\nzone and you WILL be jumped so you need one tank<br/>\nkilling a monster and the other killing and TAUNTING the<br/>\nothers off you. I prefer Trolls or Ogres simply because<br/>\nof the sheer number of Hp they have and I love when<br/>\nthey rollplay =) Obviously if you have a troll or ogre<br/>\ntank they should do the taunting.&lt;br&gt;**Always have an(<br/>\n/assist mr.X ) hotkey button. Make sure the rest of the<br/>\ngroup does as well. Pick the one tank who kills one<br/>\nthing at a time and not the one taunting. &lt;br&gt;**Use the<br/>\nassist button and make sure everyone else is too! In<br/>\nCazic you HAVE to have everyone killing the same<br/>\nmonster to get them out of the way. VERY important. If 2<br/>\ngators a Fanatic and a Sent. attack always have everyone<br/>\nkilling the same beast, in this senerio kill the fanatic<br/>\nfirst or it will heal the rest. then move to the gators<br/>\nthen the Sent. or what ever just make sure you are all<br/>\nworking on the same beast. The taunting tanks will have<br/>\nto keep the rest of the creatures carroled but he<br/>\nwill also keep mainly killing the Fanatic. &lt;br&gt;**My<br/>\ndream group would have a troll/ogre warrior doing the<br/>\ntaunting, a troll/ogre killing and pulling, a cleric<br/>\nhealing, a shaman buffing, SoWing, and shrinking the<br/>\ntanks, a mage/ench/wizzy nuking, and myslf a DE Necro.<br/>\nThe trolls/ogres can give the rest of the group time<br/>\nto evac if things go bad and still have the Hp to<br/>\nsurvive and run. (Not really a tip but a good idea of the<br/>\nkind of group to look for) &lt;br&gt;**Casters here is a<br/>\ngood rule of thumb about nuking in a dungen when you<br/>\nhave tanks in the group. Don&#39;t nuke very often. Learn<br/>\nwhen to nuke and when NOT to nuke/DoT. If your tanks<br/>\nare killing it without losing a lot of HP DON&#39;T waste<br/>\nyour mana! Save it. You might start feeling a little<br/>\nuseless but don&#39;t. There will come a time when you are<br/>\nVERY mobbed and your spells are needed, save your mana<br/>\nuntil you need it. If you just start blasting away you<br/>\nwon&#39;t be able to blast when you need to. Another<br/>\nconsequence is that you might aggro the beast on you. Things<br/>\nin dungens hit HARD and can kill you quick if the<br/>\ntanks can&#39;t taunt them off you. Stupid nuking really<br/>\np.o.&#39;s and endangers the rest of the group. When I first<br/>\nstarted in Cazic I died A LOT and it was mainly because<br/>\nof my nuking stupidly. A good rule of thumb is to<br/>\nnuke a beast ONE time per loss of ONE tank&#39;s bubble of<br/>\nhealth. AND if you are the group healer then make SURE<br/>\nyou save you mana for HEALING! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cont.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
