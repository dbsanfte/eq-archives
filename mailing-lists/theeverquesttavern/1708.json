Will be<br/>\nattempting to group with a friend that&#39;s a<br/>\nPaly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh... and since I forgot SK, Paly, and<br/>\nClerics...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clerics. Good Clerics actually need to time their heals.<br/>\nHealing is not easy. I notice Clerics healing too early<br/>\nall the time. That can cause a groups death as easily<br/>\nas a bad tank that doesn&#39;t pull the loner that peels<br/>\noff to the healers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timing your healing makes<br/>\na difference. I know LOTS of Clerics and Healers<br/>\nthat don&#39;t know that if you heal-- you will never agro<br/>\na mob if the tank is under 1/2 life. Wait till he&#39;s<br/>\ndown 2 1/2 bubbles and you can heal without ever<br/>\nagro&#39;ing. Or do what I do-- I cast almost a full circle&#39;s<br/>\nheal under. That saves mana b/c my specialization is<br/>\nAlteration over all and I can time my med cycles. Plus I can<br/>\nheal when tank&#39;s only 2 bubbles down usually without<br/>\ngetting agro&#39;d.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SK. They&#39;ve got fear and can use<br/>\npets. Not great Tanks but okay. Best thing about SK&#39;s<br/>\nis in tough fights-- HT. Not much else I can say<br/>\nabout SK&#39;s. They tank about as well as a Ranger, and do<br/>\nless overall melee damage. However, their spells make<br/>\nthem a welcome addition. I know very little about SK&#39;s<br/>\nother than that I don&#39;t have them in a group<br/>\noften.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paly&#39;s. I love these guys too. Terrible tanks as I get<br/>\nhigher but the heals are a welcome sight to my poor<br/>\nmana. Plus they can buff themselves so I don&#39;t have to<br/>\nheal and they can STUN. Ever been in a Chain Stun<br/>\ngroup? S&#39; cool. Especially a Chanter, Paly, Wizzie chain<br/>\nstun group. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... sorry for<br/>\nthe rant on Clerics. Love them to death and their<br/>\nRezzes rock. But many clerics, don&#39;t seem to time their<br/>\nheals well and I&#39;m constantly pulling off mobs from<br/>\nclerics. Snare, dot, stun, beg. They end up begging to<br/>\nkill me. LOL.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
