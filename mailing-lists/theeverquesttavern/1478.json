Ever since my first death at the<br/>\nhands of a lowly Faydark Orc Pawn, I have taken up the<br/>\ncause of the Faydark elves and worked at the<br/>\nerradication of all orcs from Norrath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ihave a few<br/>\nmore things to do in Antonicus, then back home to<br/>\nKelethin, and finally I&#39;ll be off to Kunark. I&#39;ll probably<br/>\nbe at lvl 21 by the time I get there. BTW-- i picked<br/>\nup a sweet Shiny Brass Halbeard from a named Orc in<br/>\nHP. Anyone got a price on it?? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for newbie<br/>\nquestions -- who doesn&#39;t agree that the $10.00 isn&#39;t worth<br/>\nit? With a new expansion with a new race and class<br/>\ncoming out by the end of the year-- man-- this game<br/>\nrocks! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 20th<br/>\nseason&lt;br&gt;Xev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/auction WTT Home brewed ale for a tale of courage and<br/>\nadventure-- send tell please!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
