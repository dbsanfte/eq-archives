Although one thing that I do, and I doubt anyone else does-- I stick with lower level","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1122851176\">Not sure-- any recent patches that might have<br/>\nnerfed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although one thing that I do, and I doubt anyone else<br/>\ndoes--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I stick with lower level spells almost always. Even<br/>\nif they resist, your spells don&#39;t cost as much mana<br/>\nanyway and you fizzle less. It may not be the best way<br/>\nbut spells are designed to be costly to use when you<br/>\nfirst get them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only level 24 spell I use<br/>\nconsistantly right now is Wolf form and my rings. I have them<br/>\nin case I need them but they&#39;re too mana intensive<br/>\nand fizzle more. Wolf form is worth it if you&#39;re<br/>\nabout to stick and camp for a long time. Improves AC,<br/>\nAttack, Damage, AND gives you speed faster than SOW<br/>\nprovided you don&#39;t zone AND lasts 1 1/2 hours or<br/>\nso.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, maybe you got lucky and now the spells are being<br/>\nresisted more due to regular luck. Or maybe you&#39;ve been<br/>\nnerfed in some way and don&#39;t know it. Final suggestion<br/>\nis try another zone. Some zones have had mobs get<br/>\nupgraded. Perhaps that&#39;s the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>\nout&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS Sorry I&#39;m always so long winded. Hope this helps.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic of the Drinal server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
