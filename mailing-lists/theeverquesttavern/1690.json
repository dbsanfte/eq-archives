A<br/>\ngreat lvling place for a lvl 26. And my puller pulled a<br/>\ntrian. Thats ok but what they didn&#39;t do is help<br/>\nme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For those that don&#39;t know when a cleric heals the<br/>\ntank all the free npcs are agroed by the heal and im<br/>\nattacked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I died from this 3 times before i<br/>\ndisbanded the group and made another one. I&#39;m just venting<br/>\nsteam. I&#39;m tired of tanks not helping out there clerics.<br/>\nwe can&#39;t cast when attacked. so i don&#39;t see why a<br/>\ntank would not drop what he was doing and save his<br/>\nclerics behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I knwo what you thinking there<br/>\nane also clerics that try to tank and don&#39;t heal.<br/>\ni&#39;ve grouped with these and always try to help them.<br/>\nTeach them how to be a good ckeric. if they don&#39;t learn<br/>\nthey leave the party. My ranger knows too well about<br/>\nhealers that don&#39;t heal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I know i sound harsh<br/>\nbut yes I am venting. well this<br/>\nis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fefelafuw signing off.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
