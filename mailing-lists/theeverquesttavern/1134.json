Qeynos Hills and East<br/>\nCommonlands are nice areas for that level if you are around<br/>\neither Qeynos or Freeport. If you&#39;re a wood elf, there<br/>\nare some areas in Greater Faydark to hit, perhaps the<br/>\nbandit camp near Kelethin. Don&#39;t know how tough these<br/>\nbandits would be for your level, but from now on, you&#39;ll<br/>\nwant at least 1 partner, maybe a mage or tank class<br/>\n(warrior, ranger, etc.). They take the damage and use melee<br/>\nwhile you sit back, heal, and ensnare. Just don&#39;t do<br/>\neither too much or too early, lest you want to get<br/>\nbeaten on. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Screenshots are available in your<br/>\nC:&#92;Windows&#92;Program Files&#92;Everquest folder. They will be called<br/>\nEQ000000, EQ000001, etc. They are bitmaps, around 1MB in<br/>\nsize each, so you&#39;ll want to save them as JPEGs if you<br/>\nwant to save any of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51st<br/>\nChampion of Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
