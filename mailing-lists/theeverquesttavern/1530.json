I have a level 16<br/>\nBarbarian Shaman and a level 17 Wood Elf Druid on the<br/>\nNameless Server. I&#39;ve enjoyed reading through the posts<br/>\nhere. I&#39;ve had to suspend my EQ account for a couple of<br/>\nmonths and I&#39;m going through HORRIBLE EverQuest<br/>\nwithdrawals, lol (this should be remedied fairly soon, thank<br/>\nGod)! I&#39;ve been surfing EQ websites for an EQ fix, and<br/>\nI ran across info on the new expansion that&#39;s due<br/>\nat the end of the year; it seems really incredible.<br/>\nThe idea of Norrath having a habitable moon is really<br/>\nterrific. Since I haven&#39;t been able to log on, I&#39;m<br/>\nwondering what people are saying about it. Is there any<br/>\ncontroversy? I haven&#39;t seen the subject discussed here and I&#39;m<br/>\nwondering what you all think. Have you checked out the<br/>\nscreenshots and everything?
