I have a 32 wizard, a 27 <br/>\nwarrior, 21 monk, 16 cleric, and 10 shaman (probably 11 by the time <br/>\nyou guys respond to this).  I just have a few questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  When casting a spell, the spell type (evocation for nukes, <br/>\nConjuratoin for summoning, etc.) effects weather you fizzle or not, <br/>\nfor the most part and chanelling effects if your spell is inturpted <br/>\nor resited, to a point.  Right?<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  I know there are a lot of really good INT gear out there.  But <br/>\nwhat is some good shaman gear?  I have gone to bazaar and bought him <br/>\na Spine Chill Spear (10:28 3agi 6wis 10svcold, i think) and a 3wis <br/>\nring, but what else could I get him.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Where can I go with my wizard?  the level 32 one.  I got board of <br/>\nHK and I am floating around now just wondering where to go.  I am <br/>\njust porting and getting money atm, but i want to get to level 34 and <br/>\n39 to get the rest of my port spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nZephlarus (32 Wizard)<br/>\n&lt;Dragons Honor&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTenolas (27 Warrior)<br/>\n&lt;Dragons Honor&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRamaza (21 Monk)<br/>\n&lt;Dragons Honor&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHaradur (16 Cleric)<br/>\n&lt;Dragons Honor&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFenelor (10 Shaman)<br/>\n&lt;Dragons Honor&gt; (get the point ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nXegony Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
