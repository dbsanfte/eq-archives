I&#39;m not sure it works, but it&#39;s been<br/>\nbouncing around Everlore a little bit lately. &lt;br&gt;We all<br/>\nknow the &quot;patches of gnoll fur&quot; that we get from<br/>\nkilling gnolls (from pups to elites), right? Well... find<br/>\nyourself a large sewing kit, put 4 of em, (not stacked, as<br/>\nwith any trade skill) and hit combine. If what I&#39;ve<br/>\nheard works, you should get some sort of shoulder armor<br/>\n(has some save v. cold on it, I think). Take this to<br/>\nsomeone in the Halas rogue guild, and you can exchange it<br/>\nfor xp, faction with barbs, and a barbarian rogue<br/>\nweapon, which I think could be sold for a little bit. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot especially sure on any of this, but gnoll patches<br/>\nare incredibly easy to come across in blackburrow. I<br/>\nwill investigate this quest a bit and report back<br/>\nsoon. I hope it works, because I could use some good<br/>\nfaction with those crazy barbarians.. heh...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai<br/>\nOakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Druid of Spiritus Valorum&lt;br&gt;Tunare&#39;s Chosen of Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
