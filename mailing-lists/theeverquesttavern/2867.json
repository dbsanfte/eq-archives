In<br/>\nthe opening game sequence in agreeing to the contract,<br/>\na person must be of lawful age or have the consent of<br/>\na parent or legal guardian.  Unless of course, his<br/>\nfather didn&#39;t know, then his son was pursuing illegal<br/>\nactivities. <br/>\n<br/>\n And, about his solution.  Sending his son to boarding<br/>\nschool.... LMAO  don&#39;t take the kid away from video<br/>\ngames, take video games away from the kid.  I mean<br/>\nSERIOUSLY.  Any child that would not abide by the<br/>\nhouse rules isn&#39;t too well raised anyway.. he says he<br/>\nheard his son playing in the middle of the night... he<br/>\nshoulda picked his kid up by the collar and beat the<br/>\never lovin %^*$ out of him.... I gaurantee, he would<br/>\nreconsider breaking the rules if he knew there would<br/>\nbe consiquences... obviously this kid had more<br/>\nproblems thanm just video games...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Don&#39;t even get me started about the suicidal punk on<br/>\n48 hours either......   I hate to sound cold and<br/>\nlacking in compassion, but quite frankly she asked for<br/>\nthe view of the players, she undoubtedly SAW 48 hours<br/>\nin the first place, and it was most likely what<br/>\nprovoked the choice of senior thesis.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Peace out,<br/>\n  Marshun PsyKo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- bullions27 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:no_reply@yahoogroups.com\">no_reply@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/sdetail1142.html?story=1142\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/sdetail1142.html?story=1142</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In my experience, anyone who would be so afflicted<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the outcome of a game is not a terribly stable<br/>\n&gt; person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the first place.  Everquest has actually helped<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; save money for tuition, and has kept me out of<br/>\n&gt; trouble<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as well.  I sit at home and play EverQuest for a<br/>\n&gt; few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hours every night.  With a starting cost of 9.95<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the game, 12.95 a month for a pre-paid card (I<br/>\n&gt; hate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; credit cards), I get the first month free, 19.99 a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; month in internet services (which I would have<br/>\n&gt; anyway)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Everquest is a subliminal addiction, just like<br/>\n&gt; certain people setting <br/>\n&gt; all things aside for football... on a much lesser<br/>\n&gt; scale of course <br/>\n&gt; because quite frank, there is absolutely no<br/>\n&gt; redeeming value of <br/>\n&gt; dedicating one&#39;s entire time and achieving something<br/>\n&gt; in a video game <br/>\n&gt; besides personal satisfaction (unless it&#39;s some<br/>\n&gt; godawful tournament <br/>\n&gt; which I can&#39;t ****ing stand). It all depends on the<br/>\n&gt; individual. <br/>\n&gt; Certain people can set rigid guidelines for<br/>\n&gt; themselves (play for a <br/>\n&gt; certain number of hours) and abide by them, and some<br/>\n&gt; people can&#39;t. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s another link:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.etonline.com/television/a12770.htm\">http://www.etonline.com/television/a12770.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Digital<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nY!
