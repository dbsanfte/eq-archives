Errr... maybe not<br/>\nthat drastic....&lt;br&gt;I was fishing in North Qeynos over<br/>\nby Crow&#39;s when I fell in and forgot how to swim.<br/>\nBefore I could drown, I shut off my puter. I thought I<br/>\nhad drowned and was cursing myself on having to start<br/>\nfrom Surefall Glades with no armor or weapons or my<br/>\nbeloved brew. But when I played the game yesterday, I<br/>\nstarted out with a full bar of air in the bottom of the<br/>\npond! I had read the book guide after I had shut down<br/>\nthe puter yesterday, and so I know knew how to swim.<br/>\nI swam to top and got out! :) :) :) The only<br/>\nproblems I had to face after that was that I had no drink,<br/>\nand the stupid thing was lagging. So I&#39;m in Sneed&#39;s<br/>\nright now TRYING to make a purchase.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
