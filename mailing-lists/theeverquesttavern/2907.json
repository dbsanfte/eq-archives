I <br/>\nwent in and killed a few necros and the shadowknight to get the key <br/>\nfor door A and went in there for a while and bashed but still noooo <br/>\nforemans.

They are not <br/>\n&gt; behind any doors, so it&#39;s just a good ol&#39; find &#39;em and whack &#39;em <br/>\n&gt; event. When the foreman pops, he does a zone wide saying and <br/>\nappears <br/>\n&gt; towards the back on the first level, between the two skulls in the <br/>\n&gt; wall. Kill him and Sir A will spawn in the same spot. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Befallen is decent. I still visit it with my 28 war once in a <br/>\nwhile. <br/>\n&gt; On the way to the 2nd level, that is when you will find much more <br/>\n&gt; sks, necros, and mummies. They will swarm you. But since this quest <br/>\n&gt; can be done with out going down there or through any doors, you <br/>\n&gt; should be fine. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Timmye Cousteau<br/>\n&gt; 39 Druid<br/>\n&gt; The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., fire_n_butterfly &lt;no_reply@y...&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi to all. Cahlia here, 19th season wood elf druid, who is trying <br/>\n&gt; &gt; desperately to level to 20 and claim my surname heheh! Oy I hate <br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyhow, I was looking up a quest yesterday and found one I am <br/>\n&gt; &gt; interested in. Starts in Felwithe talking to the high elf who <br/>\n&gt; stands <br/>\n&gt; &gt; by the water and tells you he is troubled by his son&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; disappearance, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; please talk to someone else. I found that if you go to Befallen <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill a skeletal foreman, it will spawn Sir (something or other <br/>\n&gt; starts <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with an A). I got the directions, etc. He gives you a token you <br/>\n&gt; take <br/>\n&gt; &gt; back and give to the high elf and he gives you his daughter&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; token. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; A pretty cool amulet with 3AC, +3wis, +3int, +3 cha, +3Sta, and <br/>\n+3 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; agi I do believe. Anyhow....here&#39;s my question...can I make it in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Befallen at level 20 ok? I&#39;m scared from what I read to attempt <br/>\nit. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Apparently everything aggros terribly. EQAtlas says level 7-25+ <br/>\n&gt; mobs, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; but since they are all necros and thermagists, the damages are <br/>\nmuch <br/>\n&gt; &gt; worse than they con. I HATE dying, and I&#39;m too chicken to attempt <br/>\n&gt; &gt; without some feedback. Any suggestions or stories?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cahlia<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 19th Season,Wood Elf Druid of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Morrel Thule Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Fates of Destiny&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
