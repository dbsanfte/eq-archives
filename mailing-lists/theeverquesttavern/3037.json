I am a communications student at the <br/>\nUniversity of Washington in Seattle, WA. For a class I&#39;m taking, I <br/>\nhave to write a paper about Everquest. It would REALLY help me <br/>\nout if you could fill out my survey, so I can have some material in <br/>\nwhich to write my paper. The survey is very short (it&#39;ll take <br/>\nprobably 2 minutes), and as if it&#39;s not already obvious, I will not <br/>\nsell any of the information I receive. My only desire is to pass the <br/>\nclass, and learn more about other EQ players. With that said, I <br/>\napologize if you are seeing this for a second time. I&#39;m trying to <br/>\nget acquire as much data as possible, so I&#39;ve posted this same <br/>\npost onto various other groups. Sorry yet thanks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur survey is located at: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sitedifference.com/edu/COM480\">http://www.sitedifference.com/edu/COM480</a> . <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like more info on the class I&#39;m taking, the course <br/>\nwebsite is at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/redwood/com480/\">http://faculty.washington.edu/redwood/com480/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much.
