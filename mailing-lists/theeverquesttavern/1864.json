I wanna buy 10kpp for $100, please<br/>\ne-mail me.&quot; GRRRRR &quot;oooohhh... I wanna be an Uber Twink<br/>\nLvl 3 druid so I can be the scourge of GFay and be<br/>\nthe only 200WIS druid who /cons green to N00bs.&quot; I&#39;m<br/>\nsorry, this kind of blatant twinking ruins the game for<br/>\nme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Minor Rant-- I know that we all are assumed to like<br/>\nRPGs and other computer games, but why are all these<br/>\nClubs hit with all the &quot;come try my new game&quot; &quot;come<br/>\nbeta test this hot new game&quot;? Don&#39;t they understand<br/>\nthat we&#39;re all addicted to EQ?? Giving up EQ to try<br/>\nyour new &quot;hot&quot; game would be like passing up driving a<br/>\nFerrari to ride shotgun in a Nova. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And why aren&#39;t<br/>\nthere any good mid level quests for Druids? Does<br/>\nverrant think we really want a &quot;Wee Harvester&quot;? OMG-- i<br/>\ncan already summon my own food and drink (or forage<br/>\nit), so why do I want to carry around a 2hb shovel???<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And why do Enchanters have to run all the way to HH<br/>\nto get pet spells? The pets suck anyway, but I need<br/>\nall the help i can get at lvl 8. So I have to go from<br/>\nGfay to HH??? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what&#39;s the deal with stop<br/>\nlights?? There&#39;s too many of them in my town and they<br/>\nalways seem to turn red whenever I get close to<br/>\nthem!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And why does airplane food have to be so bad? Is it<br/>\nso hard to figure out how to get decent food on an<br/>\nairplane, heat it up and serve it so we can tell the<br/>\ndifference between chicken and fish???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what&#39;s the<br/>\ndeal with this itchy rash I&#39;ve got? Should I go see a<br/>\ndoctor, or just cover it with a band-aid and hope it goes<br/>\naway!!!???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/Xela goes into a Berzerker rage&lt;br&gt;/Xela Calms down</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
