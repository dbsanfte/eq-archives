All I could say at the time was &quot;Damn!&quot; I<br/>\nseriously have never had so much stuff before . . . and<br/>\nnow, I have to learn how to play a bard. (Never played<br/>\none past lvl 7.) I really can&#39;t solo that well,<br/>\nunless I find her 51 shammie friend who buffs me up when<br/>\nhe&#39;s on. Then . . . well, then I&#39;m killing red mobs<br/>\nfor as long as talisman lasts. :) And I have never<br/>\nhad so many people ask to inspect me! Wow . . .<br/>\nalthough I imagine a 5 bard running around in lambent with<br/>\nMM drums kinda invites that. I will say that I love<br/>\nhaving all the stuff, and I hope she doesn&#39;t unfreeze<br/>\nher account any time soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for knowledge<br/>\nbeing twinking, I never thought about that, but it&#39;s<br/>\ndefinately true. I can start almost anywhere (especially<br/>\nQeynos or Kelethin/Felwithe) and know the best possible<br/>\nway to level. But I always help my newer friends out<br/>\nwith info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Kanissa, 35 druid, Rodcet<br/>\nNife&lt;br&gt;~Catallus, the super-twinked bard of Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
