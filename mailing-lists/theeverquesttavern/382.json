Wood Elf Ranger - my personal favorite. I have a<br/>\nlvl 42 wood elven ranger on the Mith Marr server.<br/>\nRangers a very fun and complicated class to play, as well<br/>\nas versatile. As a melee class, it is our duty to<br/>\nprotect the weak spellcasters in our group from harm.<br/>\nHowever, we do not get all the convenient teleport spells<br/>\npure spellcasters get.&lt;br&gt;2. Erudite Wizard - Wizards<br/>\nare the masters of dealing the most damage in the<br/>\nshortest amount of time. They also have great travel<br/>\nspells like druids. Just a warning: if you are going to<br/>\nplay a wizard, be prepared to die a lot and spend a<br/>\nLOT of time meditating. Additionally, Erudites have<br/>\nhorrible night vision.&lt;br&gt;3. Halfling rogue - Don&#39;t know<br/>\nmuch about this class/race combo but I see a lot of<br/>\nthem around. The halfling rogues i group with seem to<br/>\nenjoy playing their character.&lt;br&gt;4. High Elf druid -<br/>\nHigh elves cannot be druids...perhaps you meant Half<br/>\nElves? Statistically, half elves make the worst druids<br/>\n(lowest wisdom score), but what the heck...it&#39;s a game,<br/>\nhave fun =)&lt;br&gt;5. Dark Elf Necro - Necromancers are<br/>\nextremely powerful - they can heal themselves, cast<br/>\npowerful Dot (damage over time) spells, summon a skeleton<br/>\nto fight for them, and do many other things. The<br/>\ndownside is that nobody outside of their own city and the<br/>\nOgre and Troll cities likes &#39;em. &lt;br&gt;dark<br/>\nelf-necromancer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
