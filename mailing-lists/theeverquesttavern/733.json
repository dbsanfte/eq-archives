I play on two servers<br/>\ncurrently:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lanys Ty&#39;vyl&lt;br&gt;&quot;Hyuri&quot;&lt;br&gt;Lvl 7 Troll<br/>\nShadowknight&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rallos Zek&lt;br&gt;&quot;Kraimar&quot;&lt;br&gt;Lvl 5 Halfling<br/>\nCleric&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I started my halfling three days ago, and I am<br/>\nputting most of my time into him. I just hit lvl 5<br/>\ntoday.. lots of new spells ;) Anyway, I am looking for<br/>\ngroups to adventure with on either server Saturday and<br/>\nSunday nights, around 8PM-12PM EST. If interested, check<br/>\nmy profile for email address. My Cleric on Rallos is<br/>\npretty good for his level... I am hitting for 20 points<br/>\nat a time, which is pretty damn good for a shrimp at<br/>\n5th lvl :) I also have decent equipment, and all my<br/>\nlvl one spells, and most of my lvl<br/>\nfive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, I want to know everyone&#39;s thoughts on PK. I like<br/>\nplaying on Rallos because it adds an edge of danger to<br/>\nthe game. Yet when I get tired of watching my back<br/>\nall the time I head to Lanys. Ironically enough, my<br/>\nTroll on Lanys has died seven or eight times... while<br/>\nmy Halfling has yet to die even once, and on a pk<br/>\nserver to boot. Do you all like the current pk rules?<br/>\nWhen I first started, players could be looted for<br/>\nmoney and ANY item. Now it&#39;s limited to carried items,<br/>\nworn items, and money. I&#39;m not complaining too much,<br/>\nbut it seems to neuter pk&#39;ing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope to see<br/>\nsome of you on EQ soon,&lt;br&gt;Sandwalker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
