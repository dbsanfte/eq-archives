EQ is a game that&#39;s fun at<br/>\nall levels, so I never understand why people are in<br/>\nsuch a hurry to get stuff that they&#39;ll get at higher<br/>\nlevels. Must be Yak envy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why not go out into<br/>\nGFay and bash evil decaying skellys, vile bats,<br/>\nswarming drones, and wretched orc pawns in your first<br/>\nyears? It will fill you with pride to know that each<br/>\npurchase you make is based solely on your own abilities<br/>\nand experiences, and not the handouts of others. My<br/>\nnew Iksar Necro char ran out into LOIO with nothing<br/>\nbut a dagger, 2 spells, and delusions of granduer,<br/>\nattacking fierce sabertooth kittys (and often running away)<br/>\nuntil lvl 3. At that point, I felt worthy enough to go<br/>\nback to my guild and seek further knowledge. Bought a<br/>\nfew spells (not all, knowing I would be back in<br/>\nanother season to be invited into the 2nd circle of dark<br/>\nbindings) and headed out again for adventure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even<br/>\nif you don&#39;t roleplay, though, I think it&#39;s good to<br/>\npay your dues at lower levels. At lvl 1, you don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to be twinked (I don&#39;t think you do at any<br/>\nlevel-- UNLESS EQ is all about keeping up with the<br/>\nJoneses). A Cleric in GFay will earn his way into many<br/>\ngroups on orc hill and then in CB in time. The loot you<br/>\ncan make yourself in CB will be staggering if you&#39;re<br/>\na good player and keep your group alive.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK-- that&#39;s my rant for the day-- haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
