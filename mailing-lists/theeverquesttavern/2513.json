SOE usually holds on to folks&#39; characters<br/>\nfor 3 months from when their last pay period was<br/>\nended. If it&#39;s been more than that, there&#39;s about a 3%<br/>\nchance they&#39;ll still be there... sometimes SOE misses<br/>\nsome cleanup duties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as servers...
