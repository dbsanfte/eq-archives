","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1868478409\">The Mageborn guild (unless the name is already taken)<br/>\nis growing, but cannot be formed without YOUR help. <br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have a mage, it&#39;s okay, just start one. <br/>\nWe will be generally geared (at first) to low lvl<br/>\ncharacters.  I am also working on developing a<br/>\ncharter.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We the Mageborn of Norrath hereby form this society<br/>\nof elite, to bring power to the residents of Norrath. <br/>\nOur great world has lived long enough under the thumb<br/>\nof the Gods and Dragons of great infamy.  This era<br/>\nshall be at an end.  Change shall rock this world to<br/>\nits very fabric, and we shall form a new Norrath under<br/>\nthe guidance of the Mageborn senetors.<br/>\n  1.  To be a member of the Mageborn one must be of<br/>\nthe class Mage.<br/>\n  2.  Any policy of Mageborn may be ammended with a<br/>\n3/4 senate vote.<br/>\n  3.  Co-exist peacefully with the guilds of Norrath,<br/>\nbut afford them no special treatment, for no good deed<br/>\ngoes unrewarded.<br/>\n  4.  To declare war upon a guild, a minimum of 10<br/>\nmembers must be present and a 2/3 vote must be in<br/>\nfavor of these actions.<br/>\n  5.  To become a member of the Mageborn Senate one<br/>\nmust be above the lvl of 20 and must be elected by a<br/>\npopular vote.<br/>\n  6.  In achieving this popular vote, one shall then<br/>\nchange his/her surname to Senator, that all may know<br/>\nof this station.<br/>\n  7.  Any complaints, made by the citizenry of<br/>\nNorrath, shall be investigated, and any offender or<br/>\ngroup therein shall be summarily court martialed by a<br/>\nmember of the senate and (a) warned (b) punished or<br/>\n(c) removed from the guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, its a work in progress, but so far its coming<br/>\nalong pretty well =P talk to you guys online  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, PS the chat room will be named Mageborn and the<br/>\npass is dragonslayer, so if you see the chat room come<br/>\nin and join.  Later all Psyko<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
