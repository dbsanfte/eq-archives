Sounds like you<br/>\nwere in a bad group, with bad spell casters, but I&#39;ve<br/>\nnot heard their side of the story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s never<br/>\nmore frustrating for a spell caster than running out<br/>\nof mana, telling the party that you are out of mana<br/>\n(OOM!), and they still pull. Also, you should have had<br/>\nSOW on you...run in circle while your casters MED to<br/>\navoid getting hit. A caster CAN NOT get that MOB off of<br/>\nyou without a spell...when a caster hits for 12-20<br/>\npoints of damage, the MOBS in unrest won&#39;t get<br/>\ndistracted from Aggroing on a tank who&#39;s done 200 pts of<br/>\ndamage on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, ensure that you are buffed<br/>\nbefore every pull...including SOW. If your casters are<br/>\nOOM, don&#39;t pull...in fact, if they are below 50% mana<br/>\n(50m), don&#39;t pull!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now why the healer healed the<br/>\n80% health wizard...I can only guess he/she was<br/>\neither a friend, or had the wrong target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melee<br/>\nclass and caster class group well together. The rely<br/>\ntotally on each other. If one side fails, the other<br/>\nsuffers...it sucks, but it&#39;s reality. Simply don&#39;t group with<br/>\nthose casters any longer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a druid, I&#39;ve had<br/>\nproblems with both types in a group, but I can GATE, HEAL,<br/>\nand SOW myself out of trouble - even if the group is<br/>\nbad! But, as an enchanter, I am totally dependant on<br/>\nthe group to know their roles and know them well.<br/>\nHealers must HEAL before looting, Tanks/Pullers must<br/>\nguard while medding, etc. During battle, I mes the<br/>\nadds, I debuff the mobs and buff the tank. It&#39;s a<br/>\nsimple game with incredibly COMPLEX role-playing that<br/>\nneeds to happen in groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For every story you<br/>\ncan share about bad casters, I can share about bad<br/>\ntanks/pullers. Learn from mistakes, give constructive critisism<br/>\nto the group, if they listen, GREAT, you&#39;re group<br/>\nwill improve. If not, DISBAND, and find some good<br/>\ncasters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CoJim, Druid of the 24th season.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
