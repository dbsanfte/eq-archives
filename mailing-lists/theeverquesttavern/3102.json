I think that would<br/>\nbe really neat. We could meet one day a week on these characters, that way<br/>\nwe can play our others too. I know some of you already have 5 characters.<br/>\nBut you can delete to make a new character. I have done that to move to<br/>\ndifferent server. Now i only have 2 charcaters, so ie easy for me to go to<br/>\ndifferent server to make a new character. I thought this would be a neat<br/>\nidea, kinda like a club thing.... Well, let me know you guys what you think<br/>\nand we can decide if we would like to try this.      Surreal\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHmmi would say first to go to www.eqdruids.com if you dont already \r<br/>\nknow about it. It is a terrific druid only site. In the messages \r<br/>\nboards they have sticky post about where to hunt at your general lvl. \r<br/>\nNot for sure but at 41 i think i was quadding snow cougers in ice \r<br/>\nclad or maybe the specs in oasis. After them i went to timoruos deep \r<br/>\nand started quadding spirocs. That took me to all the way to 51 xp \r<br/>\nslows down at about 50 51 on the spirocs but i know can take you to \r<br/>\n52 as i am about to ding it there. Or you can start trying the \r<br/>\nraptors in that same zone also. I havent tried them yet but read that \r<br/>\nit can be done. If you want to make some money and xp head to cobalt \r<br/>\nscar and quad the wyverns. Save the pelts and sell them in bazaar and \r<br/>\nsell the gems to vendors for about 40plat. This is a bit more \r<br/>\ndangerous and harder as there is always people there farming. Unless \r<br/>\nyou have killed alot of giants in velious and raised your claws of \r<br/>\nveeshan \r<br/>\nfaction you will be kos to the drakes there and they cast on you for \r<br/>\nlike 300 dam. Do not pull the named wyvern he cannot be slowed or \r<br/>\nsnared. As far as the wis items i just went to bazaar and filled in \r<br/>\nthe filters one of them you can pick wis and all wis items will come \r<br/>\nup then just shop away. It will be slow quadding till you get your \r<br/>\nnew aoe spell lightnig blast and lvl 45 when you can get kei then its \r<br/>\nsmooth sailing to 51. Oh there is a good quest wis book you can hold \r<br/>\nin your off hand adss like 10 wis and somethin other would be easy to \r<br/>\nobtain at you lvl. Sorry but i forgot the name of it next time im on \r<br/>\nill check but can prolly find it on the druid site.\r<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theeverquesttavern@yahoogroups.com\">theeverquesttavern@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sue &lt;kstiggermom@y...&gt; \r<br/>\nwrote:\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ** sigh **\r<br/>\n&gt;  \r<br/>\n&gt; I guess I&#39;m the loner.
