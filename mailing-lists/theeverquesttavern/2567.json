For some reason there&#39;s a new love for acronyms.<br/>\n<br/>\nPST is no longer Pacific Standard Time. It&#39;s Please Send Tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nLFG is looking for group. Which makes sense and is also a tag command <br/>\nyou can use anyway. Course I think LFG may have first occurred on <br/>\nservers about 8 months ago so you may already know that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of new Beastlord stuff and content, but that&#39;ll be fun <br/>\nfor you to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly really unobvious one is the command /tgb.
