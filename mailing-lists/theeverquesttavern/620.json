Hehe, I knew the story behind those rare-spawns<br/>\nso a killed it! To my luck I found a BB cask on it,<br/>\nwhich I still didn&#39;t know hoe to do the BBstout quest<br/>\nyet. So...I figured I could find out later! The next<br/>\nday someone said over the zone that he wanted to buy<br/>\nthe BBcask desparately! So I asked how much you<br/>\nwilling to pay? He said A WHOPPING 100PP (fairly good for<br/>\na lvl 13 bard hehe) So I said fine! Sold it! Got my<br/>\nmoney! Then BOOM! I was rich! Also that same day I<br/>\nrecieved a Chitin Shield, a PGT, and elf-hide gloves, all<br/>\nabsolutely FREE! =) Oh my, what a day lol!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
