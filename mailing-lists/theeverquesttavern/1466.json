Awhile back, when I was hopelessly<br/>\naddicted to Evercra--err Everquest, I began writing a<br/>\nstory based on one of my characters. Considering how<br/>\nfar I usually get with a story,or rather, how quickly<br/>\nI stop writing before I get far at all, the story<br/>\ntook off and the ideas flowed! I had the whole story<br/>\nplanned out, but then I hit a writers block... how do I<br/>\nkeep writing when I don&#39;t know what to say? Well,<br/>\nthat&#39;s usually the way of it, I guess. With that, the<br/>\nproject died and I kept the story in my archives... until<br/>\nrecently. A few days ago I came across a website,<br/>\nwww.stories.com. The site is rather innovative and I quickly saw<br/>\npotential in it for myself. So, yesterday (or was it the<br/>\nday before?) I went ahead and posted 2 of my stories,<br/>\nincluding the one linked<br/>\nbelow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315\">http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315</a> target=new&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315&lt;/a\">http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, my writers block on both stories is still in<br/>\nplace and I need some help.. Therefore I&#39;ve set up the<br/>\nstories to be interactive.. Basicly an Interactive Story<br/>\nis one where, at the end of each chapter, the reader<br/>\nis given several options. As the story progresses,<br/>\nthe reader will eventually reach a choice that hasn&#39;t<br/>\nbeen written yet. At this point, the reader is given<br/>\nthe opportunity to add to the story, further<br/>\ndeveloping the plot. I&#39;ve done this to see what people come<br/>\nup with. New ideas might help break down my writers<br/>\nblock.. if it doesn&#39;t, then at least it&#39;ll be fun to<br/>\nwatch a story develop at the hands of whoever reads it!<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ll also post the first small section of the<br/>\nstory in just a moment. If you like what you read,<br/>\nplease go visit the Interactive Story version at the<br/>\nlink above and read the rest. Then, PLEASE rate it..<br/>\nfeedback is important and without a rating, I&#39;ll never<br/>\nknow what people think. Also, if your interested, feel<br/>\nfree to contribute to the story! I won&#39;t delete<br/>\nanything at all that&#39;s written by someone who takes the<br/>\nstory seriously and has played enough EQ to know what<br/>\nthey&#39;re talkin about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darkmyst - A once great Dark<br/>\nElf himself</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
