So nice to see you posting.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Congratulations again on level. I hope you got it back.<br/>\n;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lake Rathe is an oustanding place to hunt...I stayed<br/>\nthere from 20-25, in group and solo. From there,<br/>\nconsider the Keep in HighPass Hold before moving on to<br/>\nCazic. You can fight in the Keep from 23-35, and then<br/>\nstart checking Cazic at about 25+. Cazic is good<br/>\nhunting, but you can&#39;t beat the Keep for experience. Of<br/>\ncourse, having food, merchants, and a bank right upstairs<br/>\nmakes it all the more appealing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send me a tell<br/>\nin game if you&#39;re inclined. I&#39;d like to hear from<br/>\nyou again. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May Tunare guide your way and<br/>\nbless you always.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Murial Mayere&lt;br&gt;Druid of<br/>\nKelethin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
