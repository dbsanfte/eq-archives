I think<br/>\nthe game is fantastic and it is probably my favorite<br/>\ngame of all time. Meeting all sorts of people and<br/>\nadventuring together is fantastic, but I just feel the game<br/>\ntakes up far too much time. You can&#39;t really get on for<br/>\n15 minutes for a short session, you have to play for<br/>\nhours at a time to succeed. Also, if you want to take a<br/>\nbreak from the game, you fall far behind your friends<br/>\nand can&#39;t hunt with them anymore. So, I&#39;ve decided to<br/>\nmove on and do some other things in my life ;) Don&#39;t<br/>\nget me wrong, I think the game is great and I wish<br/>\neveryone in Norrath a fond farewell and good<br/>\nluck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trellan Hawksight, retired ranger of Tunare.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
