(He quit about 2 years<br/>\nback.) He used to get on an all rogue group around lvl<br/>\n30 to 40. I even think this was back before they<br/>\ninvented Instill Doubt but I never played a rogue till<br/>\nrecently-- sooooo... not for sure on that<br/>\none.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, they used to gather around-- everyone<br/>\npickpocketed and backstabbed as often as possible. It was<br/>\ntruly sick amounts of damage. Mobs would just spin in<br/>\ncircles as agro switched to the one that just got<br/>\nbackstab off. But when 6 rogues have you<br/>\nsurrounded...someone can always backstab.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>\nPrismatic&lt;br&gt;Drinal Server-- The Tribunal of the Antiquities&lt;br&gt;Key<br/>\nword, /who &quot;The Tribunal&quot;.
