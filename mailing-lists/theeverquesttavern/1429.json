Can anyone else confirm that<br/>\nhide/sneak is similar to invi/camo? That makes sense to me,<br/>\nespecially if see invis lets you see hidding/sneaking PCs.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you&#39;re sitting in &quot;hide&quot; mode, i&#39;ve noticed that<br/>\nsome animals who KOS you will see through the hide.<br/>\n(they must be able to smell me!!) This is not true when<br/>\nsitting invis/camo, as far as I know. I have not had an<br/>\nanimal see through my invis - in fact, last night i was<br/>\ninches from Grimfeather the griffen, while camo, and he<br/>\n/conned indiff and ignored me. I have noticed that<br/>\ncasters (ie. orc oracles and derv casters) will see<br/>\nthrough my hide, and send their buddies after me. This is<br/>\nless true (IME - in my experience) with camo, though<br/>\nit happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/con is ALWAYS the rule to be<br/>\nsure. Indiff is a good thing, especially when it comes<br/>\nto Griffs!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-- i&#39;ll get the /con guide<br/>\nand print what it says about levels of green-ness,<br/>\nblue-ness, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
