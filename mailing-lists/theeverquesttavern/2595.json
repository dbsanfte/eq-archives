Well, you can do it if you&#39;re not a Dwarf Rogue, <br/>\nbut you won&#39;t be able to use the item you get.  The other tongues are <br/>\nfrom three other Dwarf bandits, all in Butcherblock Mountains.  <br/>\nBarma, Crytil and Keldyn are the other three Dwarf Bandits.  Turn in <br/>\ntheir tongues to Diggins in Kaladim (but not Qued&#39;s or anyone <br/>\nelse&#39;s!), and you get a Parrying Pick (AC 7, Dwarf Rogue only).  It&#39;s <br/>\nreally useful only until you get Dual Wield at level 13 (?), at which <br/>\npoint you&#39;ll want two weapons anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nKharlisht, 28 Dwarf Rogue</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
