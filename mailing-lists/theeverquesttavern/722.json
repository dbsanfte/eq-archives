So if you want<br/>\nto powerlevel your lower level friend, feel free to<br/>\nultra buff him/her and debuff the mob, it will not be<br/>\ncounted as damage towards the mob. (for exp purposes<br/>\nanyhow) Great spells for this are Quickness, Drowsy, high<br/>\nlevel Skin/Talisman/Daring series. Stuns help<br/>\ntoo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, if you are a high level enchanter<br/>\nhelping out some random newbie to powerlevel, you could<br/>\ndo this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Quickness/Cloud/Beserker Strength<br/>\nthe newbie&lt;br&gt;2) Tashani/Languid<br/>\nPace/Disempower/Whirl/Flux the mob&lt;br&gt;3) after the newbie does over half<br/>\ndamage, blow the mob away using DD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the newbie<br/>\nwill get all the exp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try to avoid using DOTs.<br/>\nThey are not effective to cast at the end of a fight<br/>\nobviously. And if you cast them at the beginning it is hard<br/>\nto judge how much damage the mob has taken from the<br/>\nnewbie, and how much was from the DOT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heals are<br/>\nanother good way to help :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this<br/>\nhelps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
