Or the other tank. Usually in my<br/>\nfull groups it tends to be the following: Warrior,<br/>\nRanger (or another warrior), Rogue or Paladin (possibly<br/>\na monk), Cleric, Enchanter, and a Druid (me!). It<br/>\nis the chanter&#39;s job to control extra mobs via<br/>\nMez... if the chanter is being attacked, then it falls<br/>\nto the ranger to taunt it off the chanter (works<br/>\nwell due to a high damage output by the ranger along<br/>\nwith taunt). This strategy tends to work quite well,<br/>\nand has turned many uncontrollable (normally) trains<br/>\ninto a good bit of fun and experience. And the reason<br/>\nfor the druid?
