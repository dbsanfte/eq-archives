Those cost plat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>\nused to have money problems too. After I got gate, it<br/>\nhelped greatly with money. I&#39;d got to velious or<br/>\ndreadlands or FV. Good gate places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another thing I<br/>\nused to do was the CB belt quest. That&#39;s good for<br/>\nfaction, Exp, AND some coins. It also gives you and item.<br/>\nI decked my Druid in leather that way and sold<br/>\nextras for a few gold each. Not too bad. You can also<br/>\nsell CB belts for a plat a piece. But the faction and<br/>\nexp always made me turn in the belts. Too valuable in<br/>\ntoo many ways to sell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh... but sell your DF<br/>\nbelts. Reason I say that is cause it gives you terrible<br/>\nfaction hits. Those that don&#39;t care about faction-- well<br/>\nthat&#39;s okay I suppose. I sell DF belts for about 2 to 4<br/>\nplat each though and to me-- that&#39;s a lot more<br/>\nimportant than killing my faction that I&#39;d have to work to<br/>\nregain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s just my 2 cents on CB versus DF<br/>\nbelts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS...<br/>\nCB=crushbone, DF=deathfist.&lt;br&gt;Both are bands of Orcs in EQ</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
