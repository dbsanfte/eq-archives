Now I&#39;m pondering<br/>\nspending all my plat on tailored backpacks for every slot<br/>\nthat has a backpack on my Druid. LOL SNIP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do<br/>\nNOT do that! There is an alternative! You used to be<br/>\nable to get 10 slot sewing kits from Spoolie Gee in N<br/>\nRo but they made them no longer available to force<br/>\nfolks to use looms.&lt;br&gt; You can go to Velious and<br/>\npurchase 10 slot tool boxes (hold giant (size) for less<br/>\nthan 2pp each. They are on a gnome near the dock. He&#39;s<br/>\nin an igloo if I remember correctly.&lt;br&gt; You can<br/>\nalso go to Luclin (The Bazaar to be exact) and<br/>\npurchase merchant bags (10 slot, 25weight (ouch) holds<br/>\ngiant) for less than 2 pp each also. And the merchant is<br/>\nnot more than a few feet from the bank that is<br/>\nthere!Now all 7 of my toons have 80 spaces in the bank! The<br/>\nonly problem is finding enough keepable stuff to fill<br/>\nthem!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye Cousteau&lt;br&gt;31 Aquanaut of Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
