Also, once you get up your 20&#39;s and you get Camoflage, you should think about running through the Warrens and go into Stonebrunt. Stay close to the zone at first, there are some tough animals out there, but a great place to practice your fear kiting. Panic Animal is a very handy spell. Plenty of Kobolds to get XP and loot off of too. On my server, Solusek Ro, Stonebrunt is usually pretty empty. Had the whole zone to myself from time to time.

You&#39;ll have to go through the Evil city of Paineel&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;training yard to do so . . . that&#39;s not usually a problem, however. <br/>\n&gt;Zone into Paineel, go forward until you see the HUGE FREAKIN&#39; HOLE <br/>\n&gt;(don&#39;t jump or fall into it, you&#39;ll probably lose your stuff), and <br/>\n&gt;turn left.  When you see daylight ahead of you, stop, align yourself <br/>\n&gt;with one of the trees out in the yard, and motor for it.  Once you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt;well into the center of the yard, you&#39;re OK. Then turn right and look <br/>\n&gt;for the tunnel to the Warrens and the Hole.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Would be fun to hook up with you, but I&#39;m on Sullon Zek.
