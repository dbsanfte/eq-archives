Yes, they&#39;ll skin you alive even more <br/>\n  quickly than the Wood Elves.

Relish your evil, <br/>\n  revel in it.  You can always create an alt someday and go exploring <br/>\n  the good zones you&#39;ve never gotten to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kharlisht Kuzlidul, 28 Dwarf Rogue, semi-retired but thinking about <br/>\n  moving to Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., &quot;the_dark_elf_drizzt_do_urden&quot; <br/>\n  &lt;joeyis007@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;ve been killing orcs to build faction but so far it hasn&#39;t had an <br/>\n  &gt; effect.
