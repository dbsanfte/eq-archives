I think HE<br/>\nrangers are pretty well balanced for melee, but still<br/>\nneed to work on WIS stuff. It was a LOT easier to get<br/>\nmy wood elf druid to a great WIS-- (187 at lvl 36)--<br/>\nnon twinked too. I don&#39;t have enough cash to upgrade<br/>\nat all beyond what i have bought-- in fact, i&#39;m not<br/>\nsure if i&#39;ll be able to afford my lvl 39 spells!!!!<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for starting points-- it depends on what you<br/>\nwant. The magical spells will advance quickly-- don&#39;t<br/>\nworry about them. In a low level char, I usually put a<br/>\npoint or 2 to sense heading to get it going, maybe a<br/>\nfew to my primary weapon type (at low levels you&#39;ll<br/>\ndo a lot of melee and want to max out weapon<br/>\nskills-- at higher levels you won&#39;t worry about it as<br/>\nmuch). I have a habit of putting a point into all new<br/>\nskills after i get them (some you HAVE to in order to<br/>\nget them started). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than that, if you&#39;re<br/>\ninterested in trade skills, you may want to put a few<br/>\nbeginning points into them. At the lower levels, Tailoring<br/>\nis cheap and easy-- you&#39;ll be getting silk and pelts<br/>\n(well, if you&#39;re a RP druid, maybe not pelts) from the<br/>\nget go-- save money by using the community loom.<br/>\nPatterns are about 6sp each, and patchwork armor sells<br/>\nback to merchants for over 1gp, so you&#39;re making<br/>\nprofit on successes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feel free to ask more ??<br/>\nhere or on EQDRUIDS club!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;xela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
