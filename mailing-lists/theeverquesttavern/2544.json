The bonuses are trivial <br/>\nto your proc rate (unless they are tremendous bonuses) and it&#39;s not <br/>\nworth losing the AC over. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgility measures how fast you can increase your defensive skills, and <br/>\nadds a little AC. Being a Ranger you should have a pretty high AGI <br/>\nscore anyway. Again, the bonuses aren&#39;t worth the loss of AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only exception would be if you need to get a stat over a hump, <br/>\ne.g. getting an attribute to over 75 or 100 or 200. Even then, it&#39;s a <br/>\nhard argument to lose AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., myrlok wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Okay folks, I just got two I think they were<br/>\n&gt; serpentine bracers (AC 1 Dex +2?maybe 3, Agility +9) Well my<br/>\n&gt; ranger has two bracers at the moment with 6ac a piece.<br/>\n&gt; When I put on my new bracers I loose a lot of AC.
