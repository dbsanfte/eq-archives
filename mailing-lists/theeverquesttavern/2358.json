Something you might<br/>\nwant to try before spending 100-200 bucks on a new<br/>\ncard is increasing your computers virtual memory. I<br/>\nbought a new computer and immediately upgraded it to 512<br/>\nRam. I still couldn&#39;t get on. I checked my virtual<br/>\nmemory and it was set very low. Typically, the virtual<br/>\nmemory&#39;s minimum level should be the amount of ram you<br/>\nhave, i.e. 320. The maximum should be set to twice<br/>\nthat. On Windows XP, you can change virtual memory by<br/>\nselecting the system icon in the control panel...click on<br/>\nthe &quot;advanced&quot; tab. Under &quot;Performance&quot;, select<br/>\n&quot;Settings.&quot; Choose &quot;Advanced&quot; Tab and change the vm from<br/>\nthere. Hope this helps!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tahksan - 17th Druid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
