Kaladim ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1794907849\">Don&#39;t forget about THE best Kaladim quest-- belts<br/>\nand shoulderpads from the evil orcs in Crushbone!!!<br/>\nCan&#39;t Pallys also do the Corflunk&#39;s head quest? Kaladim<br/>\nis full of good low-mid level quests, and then some<br/>\nhigher ones that send you on great adventures across the<br/>\nworlds. (Much better that the ONE lame quest for wood-elf<br/>\ndruids in Kelethin-- &quot;uh....go and get me some rusty<br/>\nweapons. That will make Tunare happy, cuz we don&#39;t like<br/>\npointy things that are rusty. Oh, except<br/>\nscimitars...we&#39;re ok with those, I guess.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IMHO-- the game<br/>\nis called Ever&quot;QUEST&quot; for a reason. There are tons<br/>\nof quests you can get in any number of cities.<br/>\nTalking to NPCs to figure out who they are, how they fit<br/>\ninto the world, and what they&#39;d like you to do for<br/>\nthem, is a large part of the fun. AND-- some quests are<br/>\njust plain great for quick XP. At certain levels, the<br/>\nCB belt and pad quests will powerlevel you. The<br/>\npoint, though, is that questing can be a lot of fun, and<br/>\ngive you some direction and purpose. This is<br/>\nespecially great if you like to roll play a little.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m currently working on my mage focus items quests,<br/>\nwhich is proving to be quite challenging. My druid<br/>\ncharacter doesn&#39;t seem to get as many quests as other<br/>\nclasses, and the few good ones require LONG camps-- which<br/>\nI think hurts the game. Initial symbol quest??<br/>\nUGH-- i&#39;ve been tracking and hunting rancorous ghasts<br/>\nin Lfay off and on for a long time. I&#39;ve gotten<br/>\nlucky enough to find a dozen in that time-- NONE have<br/>\ngiven up a heart. I need 4 hearts to finish the quest.<br/>\nIs this likely to happen??????&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t be<br/>\ndiscouraged, though. Just move to another quest!!! Quest<br/>\non!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
