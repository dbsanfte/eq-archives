I have been hunting in OT, Mistymoore, and<br/>\nIceclad Ocean, hunting cougars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also wanted to<br/>\ntalk weapons. I use a wurmslayer as my primary, and BA<br/>\nlong sword in my secondary. Im always looking to get<br/>\nbigger and better so im curious to what other people are<br/>\nusing. Any suggestions on what do buy ? Im primarily a<br/>\n1HSlasher. Im leaning toward weapons that have smaller dly<br/>\nrather than dmg. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your thoughts )</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
