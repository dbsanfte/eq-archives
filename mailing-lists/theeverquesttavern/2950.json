I&#39;ve been playing EQ for over a year now and <br/>\nhave managed to get my son into the game and then my daughter.  <br/>\nFinally last September my husband broke down and started a <br/>\ncharacter.  Now he&#39;s way addicted to the game so we spend a lot of <br/>\ntime playing :)  We all play on Tarew Marr mostly evenings and <br/>\nweekend afternoons West Coast time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to reading posts and seeing you in game!<br/>\n<br/>\nKanalyn Misticmoon 25 Human Druid<br/>\nAllilee 19 Half Elf Ranger<br/>\nJenayla 6 Barb Shaman<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
