Cahlia here, 19th season wood elf druid, who is trying <br/>\ndesperately to level to 20 and claim my surname heheh! Oy I hate <br/>\ntaking 1 step forward and 2 steps back!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I was looking up a quest yesterday and found one I am <br/>\ninterested in. Starts in Felwithe talking to the high elf who stands <br/>\nby the water and tells you he is troubled by his son&#39;s disappearance, <br/>\nplease talk to someone else. I found that if you go to Befallen and <br/>\nkill a skeletal foreman, it will spawn Sir (something or other starts <br/>\nwith an A). I got the directions, etc. He gives you a token you take <br/>\nback and give to the high elf and he gives you his daughter&#39;s token. <br/>\nA pretty cool amulet with 3AC, +3wis, +3int, +3 cha, +3Sta, and +3 <br/>\nagi I do believe. Anyhow....here&#39;s my question...can I make it in <br/>\nBefallen at level 20 ok? I&#39;m scared from what I read to attempt it. <br/>\nApparently everything aggros terribly. EQAtlas says level 7-25+ mobs, <br/>\nbut since they are all necros and thermagists, the damages are much <br/>\nworse than they con. I HATE dying, and I&#39;m too chicken to attempt <br/>\nwithout some feedback. Any suggestions or stories?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nCahlia<br/>\n19th Season,Wood Elf Druid of Tunare<br/>\nMorrel Thule Server<br/>\n&lt;Fates of Destiny&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
