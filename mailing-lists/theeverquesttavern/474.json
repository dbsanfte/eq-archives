A high lvl druid changeg all members of my<br/>\nparty into wolf form and it was such a trip. As soon as<br/>\nthe 2 new severs go in I entend to start a druid<br/>\ncharacter. I&#39;ve only been playing EQ since X-mass and it has<br/>\ntotally taken over my life. I haven&#39;t been to the movies<br/>\nin a month and i once stayed up and played for 2<br/>\ndays. My question is does the mania ever stop? I even<br/>\nhave my Mom who never plays games addicted. We fight<br/>\nover the computer. This game has too much power, but<br/>\nwho am i to complain....It&#39;s so much<br/>\nfun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Aeday &lt;Dark Legion&gt;&lt;br&gt;lvl 14 DEL Necro&lt;br&gt;Xegony<br/>\nServer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the good die young.
