The<br/>\n&gt; reason given <br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the request by the FAITH Copy Editor was both<br/>\n&gt; ignorant and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; discriminatory. &quot;The Salisbury Post FAITH section<br/>\n&gt; is for people <br/>\n&gt; who <br/>\n&gt; &gt; believe in God&quot; and &quot;this is not the image that<br/>\n&gt; The Post wants to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; portray.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Salisbury Post&#39;s mission statement says in<br/>\n&gt; part: <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We are a marketing and customer driven company<br/>\n&gt; whose mission is <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; inform, educate and entertain. We strive to mirror<br/>\n&gt; the unique <br/>\n&gt; &gt; communities we serve and offer responsible public<br/>\n&gt; forum.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; We fail to see how denying a Pagan/Wiccan study<br/>\n&gt; group an equal <br/>\n&gt; space <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with other congregations fulfills this mission<br/>\n&gt; statement. The <br/>\n&gt; &gt; decision was made with personal prejudices and not<br/>\n&gt; handled with a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; professional demeanor. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Regardless of whether or not Paganism is The<br/>\n&gt; Salisbury Post&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; religion, it is our religion. The Federal<br/>\n&gt; Government recognizes <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Paganism/Wicca, as an official religion. Military<br/>\n&gt; Courts of <br/>\n&gt; Justice <br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the U.S. have also found Wicca to be a valid<br/>\n&gt; religion, <br/>\n&gt; deserving <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of protection under the First Amendment of the<br/>\n&gt; U.S. Constitution. <br/>\n&gt; In <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the case United States v. Phillips, (42 M.J. 346)<br/>\n&gt; in 1995) the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; concurring opinion by Judge Wiss stated: &quot;First,<br/>\n&gt; Wicca is a <br/>\n&gt; socially <br/>\n&gt; &gt; recognized religion. It is acknowledged as such by<br/>\n&gt; the Army. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; See `Dept. of the Army (DA) Pamphlet 165-13-1,<br/>\n&gt; Religious <br/>\n&gt; Requirements <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A<br/>\n&gt; Handbook for <br/>\n&gt; Chaplains&#39; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (April 1980), revising A Pamphlet 165-13,<br/>\n&gt; `Religious Requirements <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook<br/>\n&gt; for Chaplains&#39; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (April 1978). Further, it is acknowledged as such<br/>\n&gt; in courts of <br/>\n&gt; law.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pagans and Wiccans are a part of your community.<br/>\n&gt; We are your <br/>\n&gt; &gt; neighbors, your coworkers, your children&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; teachers; we are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; professionals, but most importantly we are your<br/>\n&gt; readers - your <br/>\n&gt; &gt; customers!

We don&#39;t harm or seduce people.<br/>\n&gt; We are not <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dangerous. We are ordinary people like you. We<br/>\n&gt; have families, <br/>\n&gt; jobs, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hopes, and dreams. We are not a cult. This<br/>\n&gt; religion is not a joke. <br/>\n&gt; We <br/>\n&gt; &gt; are not what you think we are from looking at T.V.<br/>\n&gt; We are real. We <br/>\n&gt; &gt; laugh, we cry. We are serious. We have a sense of<br/>\n&gt; humor. You don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to be afraid of us. We don&#39;t want to convert<br/>\n&gt; you. And please <br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t try to convert us. Just give us the same<br/>\n&gt; right we give you--<br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; live in peace. We are much more similar to you<br/>\n&gt; than you think.&quot; - <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Margot Adler <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sincerely, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Undersigned <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.petitiononline.com/MMoon/\">http://www.petitiononline.com/MMoon/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Love & Blessings!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mari<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.yahoo.com/magickal_mari\">http://profiles.yahoo.com/magickal_mari</a><br/>\n&gt; Whiney little buggers aren&#39;t they?
