That depends on what you<br/>\nmean. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And typically Tailored backpacks on<br/>\nDrinal sell for 75 to 125 plat. I wouldn&#39;t pay more than<br/>\n85 plat probably though. I don&#39;t even have that<br/>\nkinda dough after spell shopping though (took me over<br/>\n225 plat to buy almost all my 39 spells).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hot<br/>\nitems are usually things like Fungi Tunics, FBSS, Yaks<br/>\nand Waks. (although I&#39;m not sure that Waks are really<br/>\nwhat ppl call them. I just do).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For low level<br/>\nloot. Yep. Bone chips are decent, and so are CB belts.<br/>\nUsed to sell a few and then go in and turn in the rest<br/>\nof mine for the quest. The exp and the item you get<br/>\nfor that quest more than made up for the run from CB<br/>\nto Kaladim and back again. Made a lot of low level<br/>\nplat for spells that way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>\nout&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... I wasn&#39;t sure what to write here. I just typed in<br/>\nsome general info. Hope it helped or answered the<br/>\nquestion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatehue Prismatic</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
