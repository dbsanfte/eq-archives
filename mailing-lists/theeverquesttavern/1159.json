It maxxes out<br/>\nat every level and doesn;t increase until you hit a<br/>\nnew level.&lt;br&gt;Suggestion. Make sure you put a point<br/>\nin all of your skills. Easy to do. Start of with<br/>\n1HB, 2HB, 2HS, 1HS, Dodge, Pierce, Offense, Defense,<br/>\netc etc. Make sure when you go to train at your<br/>\nguildmaster to put one point in the skills you want. It is<br/>\nreally hard to train low level skills once you get<br/>\nhigher in levels. Do it now. Ask anyone in game about<br/>\nputting a point in a skill and they will explain it to<br/>\nyou.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pist&lt;br&gt;Warrior of the 29th Year.&lt;br&gt;Quellious/Norrath Foreign<br/>\nLegion</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
