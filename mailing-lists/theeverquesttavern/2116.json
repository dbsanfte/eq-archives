I think some very oober Rogues and Blackguards<br/>\nmight take issue with that, but then, they&#39;d have to<br/>\nsee me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know how much<br/>\nmeaningful advice I can give you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armor? I love my<br/>\nSmall Scarab Breastplate (AC14, +1STR, +1STA, -1CHA or<br/>\nDEX, I think, +10HP, HLF, DWF, GNM only). You&#39;re just<br/>\nabout at the level where you can go to Unrest and score<br/>\na Pristine Giant Carapace. I went when I was 13 or<br/>\n14, I think. Very scary, but I solo&#39;ed lots of stuff<br/>\nin the Hedge. Then I&#39;d come out and fish in the<br/>\npools while healing (while Hidden, of course). You can<br/>\nsupposedly find Pristines off of the Giant Scarab Beetles in<br/>\nButcherblock and other places, but I only ever saw one in<br/>\nUnrest, off of the Death Beetles. Take the Pristine and<br/>\n23 gp to Vacto Molunel in South Kaladim, and he&#39;ll<br/>\ngive you a SSB. He&#39;ll also make a set of boots and a<br/>\nhelp for you, if you ask nicely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, the<br/>\nGnoll Lariat does proc a stun, but I think it&#39;s only 3<br/>\nDAM, 16 Delay (maybe lower?). I used a Tailored Whip<br/>\n(7/33) for long time in the off-hand. The Polished<br/>\nGranite Tomahawk (PGT) is 6/26, and procs a Berserker<br/>\nStrength, which apparently makes you immune from damage for<br/>\na short time. From what I gather, it will proc for<br/>\nyou at 10th level. Also adds some STR (+15, but takes<br/>\naway AGI (-3?)) for the duration of the proc (which is<br/>\nrandom, of course). I think you&#39;d be happy with either of<br/>\nthese in your off-hand when you get Dual wield (at<br/>\n14?). You wno&#39;t be able to solo Grinnix Mucktail, yet<br/>\n(the named Gnoll that drops the Tomahawk) - he&#39;s a MOb<br/>\nin the mid-20s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weaps? Hey, I used a Giant<br/>\nSnake Fang up until I bought a Walrus Tooth for 35pp (I<br/>\nsuspect you won&#39;t find one of those for a while),<br/>\nsomewhere in my mid-teens. Just keep your piercing up, of<br/>\ncourse; I like all weapon styles, so I even keep up my<br/>\n1HB. Use a Velium War Hammer for that -- again,<br/>\nthough, you won&#39;t be seeing those anytime soon. A Fine<br/>\nSteel mace will be very nice -- anything heavier, and<br/>\nyou won&#39;t get in enough swings to live long enough to<br/>\nincrease your skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, I also like Throwing<br/>\nas a skill. Sure, it&#39;s expensive and has limited<br/>\nrange, but getting in a 15 point Critical Strike, or a<br/>\n30 point Deadly, is neat. Evidently, you can<br/>\neventually blacksmith throwing javelins, which have a range<br/>\nsimilar to bows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and start collecting poison<br/>\nsupplies. Unrest is great for this -- collect stacks of<br/>\nZombie skins, and Grave Molds. Skins are used for making<br/>\nvials (you&#39;ll need Pottery skill). Two grave molds and<br/>\na suspension make a nice little low-level<br/>\npoison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nah, we don&#39;t like to rambnle or<br/>\nanything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;Rogue of 28 seasons&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
