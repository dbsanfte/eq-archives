I&#39;d say 19 is generally too low to be there, but<br/>\nthe circumstances allowed it. There were 2 high level<br/>\ngroups in the front area pulling things. They didn&#39;t<br/>\nmind if we helped is disposing of the &quot;trash&quot; as they<br/>\ncalled it, Warders, Defenders, and those low level<br/>\ncasters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was in a full group. Myself (Enchanter 18),<br/>\nShadow Knight 18, Ranger 20, Shaman 20, and 2 Wizards<br/>\nboth 20. A few of the things we were pulling were red<br/>\nto me. So instead of watching my spells get<br/>\nresisted, I would help in other ways. I&#39;d of course Tashan<br/>\nthe Mob (unresistable). Then I&#39;d usually Quickness<br/>\nthe tanks and Mez any extras. Shaman was on Heal<br/>\nduty, as his DOTs weren&#39;t really necessary with 2<br/>\nwizards in the group :) Memory Blur came in handy for me<br/>\nmany times also. One of the Wizards wasn&#39;t too good at<br/>\ntiming his burn and got frenzied on a lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We had<br/>\nto zone a couple of times, but with SoW it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nbad. I ended up getting 19th level there. Then the<br/>\nhigh level groups started thinning out and the<br/>\nremainders were pulling stuff they couldn&#39;t quite handle,<br/>\nwhich was exceedingly dangerous for us. So we decided<br/>\nto split.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, a very good night. But in<br/>\ngeneral, I&#39;d say Cazic Thule is not intended for people<br/>\nbelow level 20 :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good hunting to you<br/>\nall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
