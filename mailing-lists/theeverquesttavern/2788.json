Without any provocation or compelling force<br/>\n  behind it, it is little more than science and should<br/>\n  not be labled &quot;witchcraft&quot;.  And, on another note,<br/>\n  certification in astrology, other than a historical<br/>\n  study CANNOT be deemed scientific without results<br/>\n  which may be CONSISTANTLY reproduced.  Use the same<br/>\n  formula and you will get the same results every time. <br/>\n  Let it be known, I try to offend no one, and my<br/>\n  statements are mearly speculation.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Psyko =P peace out<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- Mari &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Magickal-Mari@...\">Magickal-Mari@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Inside Yahoo News!!<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Witches school casts spell on Alps<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Tue Oct 8,10:23 PM ET<br/>\n  &gt; By Julia Ferguson <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; KLAGENFURT, Austria (Reuters) - You won&#39;t learn how<br/>\n  &gt; to fly a <br/>\n  &gt; broomstick or cast spells with the flick of a wand,<br/>\n  &gt; but a potent dose <br/>\n  &gt; of grit and study will turn you into a witch,<br/>\n  &gt; promises Europe&#39;s first <br/>\n  &gt; School of Witchcraft. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; The school in the southern Austrian city of<br/>\n  &gt; Klagenfurt might sound <br/>\n  &gt; hocus-pocus, but those looking to emulate fictional<br/>\n  &gt; young wizard <br/>\n  &gt; Harry Potter (news - web sites) will be a mite<br/>\n  &gt; disappointed: the <br/>\n  &gt; curriculum is downright scientific, and eye of newt<br/>\n  &gt; is nowhere to be <br/>\n  &gt; seen. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Headmaster Andreas Starchel, who prefers to be<br/>\n  &gt; called by his druid <br/>\n  &gt; name Danaketh, said he established the school to<br/>\n  &gt; demystify witchcraft <br/>\n  &gt; by explaining phenomena using scientific methods<br/>\n  &gt; from physics, <br/>\n  &gt; chemistry, and biology. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Everything that is taught and learned at our school<br/>\n  &gt; can be proven <br/>\n  &gt; using natural scientific and psychological methods,&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; he told Reuters <br/>\n  &gt; during a training session in the woods. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;We teach everything needed to become a real witch<br/>\n  &gt; in the historical <br/>\n  &gt; sense -- that is to have an all-encompassing<br/>\n  &gt; knowledge of nature and <br/>\n  &gt; a highly developed sense of intuition. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Being a witch is not inborn. Anyone can learn to<br/>\n  &gt; become one,&quot; he <br/>\n  &gt; added. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Practitioners of witchcraft focus on the good in<br/>\n  &gt; life and the spirit, <br/>\n  &gt; and reject any connection with the devil, Starchel<br/>\n  &gt; said. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Since their beliefs date back to ancient times well<br/>\n  &gt; before the birth <br/>\n  &gt; of Jesus, witchcraft has no bond with the Christian<br/>\n  &gt; embodiment of <br/>\n  &gt; evil. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Witchcraft has got absolutely nothing to do with<br/>\n  &gt; the folklore image <br/>\n  &gt; of evil witches with green faces and warts on their<br/>\n  &gt; nose. It&#39;s about <br/>\n  &gt; becoming a rounded person who lives in harmony with<br/>\n  &gt; nature,&quot; said the <br/>\n  &gt; goatee-bearded druid. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; NO HOCUS-POCUS NOR HUNKUM BUNKUM <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; The headmaster stressed that his school, established<br/>\n  &gt; in 1998 for <br/>\n  &gt; wannabe witches and druids of 18 years and above,<br/>\n  &gt; has no ties with <br/>\n  &gt; religious organisations nor follows any esoteric<br/>\n  &gt; movement. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; The syllabus originally lasted three years but has<br/>\n  &gt; now been revised <br/>\n  &gt; to a more flexible form to suit students&#39; busy time<br/>\n  &gt; schedules. In a <br/>\n  &gt; sign of the times, it teaches courses over the<br/>\n  &gt; Internet as most of <br/>\n  &gt; its students live outside Austria. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; A student graduates with a venefica or veneficus<br/>\n  &gt; (from the Latin for <br/>\n  &gt; witch/druid) certificate after passing written exams<br/>\n  &gt; in seven modules <br/>\n  &gt; and submitting a final thesis. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; The first module focuses on awakening intuition,<br/>\n  &gt; specifically on how <br/>\n  &gt; to find sources of energy in nature and how to<br/>\n  &gt; channel it. Other <br/>\n  &gt; modules are astronomy, astrology, botany, holistic<br/>\n  &gt; healing and ritual <br/>\n  &gt; magic. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Curriculum information on the school website<br/>\n  &gt; www.hexen-schule.de <br/>\n  &gt; shows there are no modules like the Defence Against<br/>\n  &gt; the Dark Arts <br/>\n  &gt; class which Harry Potter had to take in the Hogwarts<br/>\n  &gt; School of <br/>\n  &gt; Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Some wannabe witches and druids are turned off<br/>\n  &gt; enrolling with us <br/>\n  &gt; when we tell them that our aim is to demystify<br/>\n  &gt; witchcraft,&quot; said <br/>\n  &gt; Starchel, who is an information technology<br/>\n  &gt; specialist by profession. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;People do approach us hoping to learn how to fly on<br/>\n  &gt; a broomstick. <br/>\n  &gt; Then we have to disappoint them and explain that<br/>\n  &gt; it&#39;s much more <br/>\n  &gt; important to let the spirit fly -- to be able to<br/>\n  &gt; combine intellect <br/>\n  &gt; with the soul.&quot; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; The school has received a huge fillip from the Harry<br/>\n  &gt; Potter books by <br/>\n  &gt; J.K. Rowling (news - web sites) and television<br/>\n  &gt; series such as Sabrina <br/>\n  &gt; the Teenage Witch. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;We actually had kids phoning up asking whether they<br/>\n  &gt; could ditch <br/>\n  &gt; their school and enrol with us,&quot; Starchel said. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; THE WITCHES OF KLAGENFURT <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Student witch Katharina, a bespectacled middle-aged<br/>\n  &gt; librarian by day <br/>\n  &gt; who asked to be identified only by her witch name,<br/>\n  &gt; said she was drawn <br/>\n  &gt; to the course because something was missing from her<br/>\n  &gt; life. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;I was looking for direction. Christianity was too<br/>\n  &gt; narrow for me and <br/>\n  &gt; didn&#39;t give me the answers I needed,&quot; she said after<br/>\n  &gt; completing a <br/>\n  &gt; session of chakra meditation with Danaketh. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Chakras are the seven key energy centres of the body<br/>\n  &gt; according to <br/>\n  &gt; Indian medicine. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;I was a bit sceptical at first but what impressed<br/>\n  &gt; me is that it&#39;s <br/>\n  &gt; not about belief or faith as in the church. The<br/>\n  &gt; school offers <br/>\n  &gt; plausible explanations for phenomena based on fact<br/>\n  &gt; -- there&#39;s no <br/>\n  &gt; hocus-pocus,&quot; Katharina said. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Katharina, who travels from Salzburg in the<br/>\n  &gt; northwest of the country <br/>\n  &gt; to attend the school&#39;s seminars, proudly shows off<br/>\n  &gt; an array of <br/>\n  &gt; bottles, vials and flasks with home-brewed potions,<br/>\n  &gt; elixirs and <br/>\n  &gt; fragrant creams with which she treats her friends. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;At first my friends and family ridiculed me for<br/>\n  &gt; wanting to become a <br/>\n  &gt; witch. But now they come to me for one of my potions<br/>\n  &gt; to soothe a <br/>\n  &gt; cough or whatever,&quot; she said. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Like Katharina, aspiring witch Saltah embraced the<br/>\n  &gt; craft three years <br/>\n  &gt; ago due to a thirst for knowledge. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;It started off as curiosity about mushrooms and<br/>\n  &gt; herbs, but then I <br/>\n  &gt; realised that I simply wanted answers to so many<br/>\n  &gt; things I couldn&#39;t <br/>\n  &gt; comprehend and that this school could provide me<br/>\n  &gt; with them,&quot; said <br/>\n  &gt; Saltah, who is in her mid-20s. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Both women said the course was challenging<br/>\n  &gt; intellectually as <br/>\n  &gt; witchcraft covered a swath of subjects. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Just learning and completing the syllabus doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  &gt; make you a witch. <br/>\n  &gt; You&#39;ve got to work at it day in day out,&quot; Saltah<br/>\n  &gt; said. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;It&#39;s going to take me another 20 years before I can<br/>\n  &gt; truly call <br/>\n  &gt; myself a witch,&quot; said Katharina, hunched over a<br/>\n  &gt; toadstool. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  === message truncated ===<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________<br/>\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
