Anyone who needs to do<br/>\nthe run can probably do it in their sleep. And you&#39;d<br/>\nstill have to sit there and watch, &#39;cause autofollow<br/>\ncan fail (like when you run into a tree).<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually, I rather enjoy taking group members on autofollow<br/>\nthrough Butcherblock, because I know all the fun<br/>\nshortcuts. Thing is, as a Rogue with Safe Fall, it&#39;s fine<br/>\nfor me, but I have injured my group members doing<br/>\nthis!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht&lt;br&gt;Rogue of 20-odd seasons&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
