There<br/>\nwas a policy that if you moved during a server split<br/>\nand didnt like it you could move back within a small<br/>\ntime frame. Now they say there is a new policy of non<br/>\nmoving unless it is during a server split, so I am stuck<br/>\non this server, and if I wish to play on a different<br/>\nserver I need to make new characters that my others<br/>\ncannot be moved. I built those characters for almost 18<br/>\nmonths of my life, I put blood sweat tears and love into<br/>\nthem, yet I do not wish to play them on the TT server,<br/>\nI want to play eq with my friends on Karana. I know<br/>\nI am not the only person in this kind of situation,<br/>\nit s so unfair to have our characters languishing on<br/>\na server we dont play on, to have to start all over<br/>\nfrom scratch and just leave our beloved characters<br/>\nrotting where we wont play them! Why should everyone<br/>\n&#39;have to be&#39; punished by this non moving policy because<br/>\nafew people are doing illegal things like selling<br/>\naccounts on Ebay?? People have to register their accounts,<br/>\nso why not have a non moving policy for non<br/>\nregistered people and only punish the poeple who deserve to<br/>\nbe punished for doing the illegal activites to begin<br/>\nwith? Or if that isnt a solution find one that only<br/>\npunishes the people who are doing these illegal activites<br/>\nand not everyone else as well! This policy does not<br/>\nstop illegal activites all it does is punish people<br/>\nwho have done nothing illegal!&lt;br&gt;If you agree please<br/>\nemail <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsmedley@...\">jsmedley@...</a> or call Verant and let them<br/>\nknow! Help me to get this totally unfair policy<br/>\nchanged!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Chantria</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
