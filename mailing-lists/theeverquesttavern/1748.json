First, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe surprised if they do give you a new key at<br/>\ncustomer service; they can figure out if the old one has<br/>\nbeen used, and if it hasn&#39;t, why not give you a new<br/>\none? They want people to play. Or, just get the $9.95<br/>\nversion for now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explain the game? Hm. Hard to<br/>\nexplain an irrational addiction that keeps you up every<br/>\nnight past your bedtime, and leads you to sites like<br/>\nthese during the day where you can daydream about it .<br/>\n. . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s a question - what kind of player<br/>\nare you? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Powergamer -- gotta have lotsa loot,<br/>\ncool garb, big honkin&#39; weapons and of course, high<br/>\nlevels as quickly as possible so you can kill bigger and<br/>\nbadder stuff?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roleplayer -- the journey is the<br/>\nthing, meeting people, exploring all the nooks and<br/>\ncrannies of a zone?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or somewhere in between? Again,<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about AC, but that&#39;s the joy of EQ, as<br/>\nit accomodates all players, even in the same group<br/>\nsometimes. I&#39;m adventuring on the lizard-continent of<br/>\nKunark, now, and I find myself in groups with Iksar (the<br/>\nplayable lizard-man race). My character doesn&#39;t quite know<br/>\nwhat to think of them, so I tell them as much when<br/>\ngrouping . . . Two nights ago, one told me to &quot;watch your<br/>\ntongue, little one&quot; and kept making comments on the order<br/>\nof &quot;You have to skin them; the hair is bad for the<br/>\ndigestion.&quot; OK, so I can&#39;t tell males and females apart yet .<br/>\n. . The powergamers in the group just let us have<br/>\nour fun, meanwhile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some tips: Don&#39;t<br/>\nplay a Player vs. Player (PvP) server to begin with;<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be very frustrated. A &quot;roleplaying&quot; server with a<br/>\nslightly different ruleset will be launched later this<br/>\nyear, which looks interesting (but no PvP). And don&#39;t<br/>\nturn in your Book of Discord, which allows you to go<br/>\nPvP on a &quot;blue&quot; (non-PvP) server. You won&#39;t be able<br/>\nto interact with anyone (cast or be cast on, for<br/>\nexample) unless they&#39;re also &quot;red.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Older servers<br/>\ntend to be more crowded; my server (Drinal) used to be<br/>\na green, &quot;preferred&quot; server, but is now just a<br/>\nregular one. More people=more competition for hunting<br/>\ngrounds, perhaps, but also more people around to help if<br/>\nyou need it, and to sell stuff, theoretically. One or<br/>\ntwo servers are &quot;unofficial&quot; roleplay servers, but I<br/>\nforget which. There&#39;s even one with a strong European<br/>\ncontingent.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Continued on next post . . . Yahoo! doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike wordy posts!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
