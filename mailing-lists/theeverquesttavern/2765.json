Why&#39;d you relocate to Qeynos, anyway?  Our <br/>\n(Wood Elf) armor and weapon quests are all centered in GFay.  But now <br/>\nthat you&#39;re 12, they may not be worth doing.  <br/>\n9-11 - Ocean of Tears, kiling Alluring Sirens.  Jump off the boat at <br/>\neither set of islands between Butcherblock and Freeport. You&#39;ll see <br/>\nthe Sirens.  Watch out for the Goblins, too.<br/>\n12-13 - Steamfont, collecting micro servers for the Trueshot quest <br/>\nlater on<br/>\n14-current - Nybright sisters in Lesser Faydark.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter this I&#39;m headed to the Warrens, but am going to wait for Dual <br/>\nWield at 17.  Hate to get out there, then have to go someplace else <br/>\nto train.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a very good weapon, which makes some of this a bit easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
