Hatred","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-354871090\">Alright. His choice of wording wasn&#39;t<br/>\nparticularly grand. But please, this world is full of people<br/>\nthat hate and then people that hate people that hate.<br/>\nHatred is hatred and your reaction isn&#39;t helping. It&#39;s<br/>\nmaking it worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calling someone a bigot for a<br/>\nprejudice is to not understand the nature of prejudice. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot saying he&#39;s right, or your wrong. I&#39;m saying that<br/>\nthe labels are far too convenient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If someone<br/>\nwants an alternative life style club, then they go<br/>\nahead and join that club instead of his<br/>\nclub.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prejudice doesn&#39;t mean evil. It means a bias towards<br/>\nsomething (non-dictionary-- off the top of my<br/>\nhead).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This club is prejudice. We exclude people that have<br/>\nnothing to do with Everquest and they are not supposed to<br/>\npost to this list. If everyone started talking UO or<br/>\nAnarchy Online, I might just stop checking the lists.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And before anyone argues that that isn&#39;t prejudice--<br/>\nby legal symantics that is prejudice. As far as I<br/>\nknow that is. I was an apartment manager and a lawyer<br/>\ntold us in a training session that prejudice depends<br/>\non what you&#39;re prejudice against. The law classifies<br/>\nour eviction of non-paying tenants as prejudice<br/>\nagainst people that cannot pay rent. The law is on our<br/>\nside there. But we cannot say, show prejudice against<br/>\nnon-firemen and give firemen preferencial treatment just<br/>\nbecause we think that will make our building safer. That<br/>\nis illegal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I probably should have waited for<br/>\nthe 24 hour rule. No responds to posts before then.<br/>\nBut I thought, eh... I&#39;m not really angry. I am<br/>\nfustrated and afraid. But only because I see fear breeding<br/>\nfear and anger breeding anger... and fustration<br/>\noverwashing, tinting, tainting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m no knight, no<br/>\nphilosopher. I am shooman. I am Fatedhue Prismatic. Thanks for<br/>\nreading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out... I am nothing-- for lack of something.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
