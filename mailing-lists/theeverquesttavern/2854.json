I&#39;m going OT now so for the <br/>\ntechnical belligerent please turn away. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might be able to have that high of a connection between your <br/>\nmodem and your computer, but that&#39;s not possible going out to the <br/>\ninternet (where you&#39;ll connect with Verant&#39;s servers). You <br/>\ncan &quot;trick&quot; the computer into thinking you&#39;re running anything over <br/>\n56K (your speed of 115+ for example) by configuring your PC to <br/>\ndisplay a higher speed but you are running 56K max regardless because <br/>\nthat is all a regular phone line can handle. Unless of course you <br/>\nhave ISDN. You can also make adjustments to your modem (tweak, like <br/>\nyou said) to make it run slightly &quot;faster&quot;, BUT in no way can it be <br/>\ncranked up to double its speed. The reason it appears faster is <br/>\nbecause normally you do not get that full 56K when you use dial-up. <br/>\nBy &quot;tweaking&quot; the modem, you are now getting that near 56K. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, websites galore advertise these things constantly saying <br/>\nyou can do all of these neat tricks to fool your modem into faster <br/>\nspeeds. That&#39;s the half truth. Yes, they might help you configure <br/>\nyour modem for maximum potential (therefore, faster speed), but going <br/>\nbeyond what it&#39;s capable of... nah, I have yet to see it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************<br/>\nDigital</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
