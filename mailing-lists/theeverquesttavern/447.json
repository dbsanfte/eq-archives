When I hit level 6 though, that&#39;s when I<br/>\ngot all the BIG money. Now I&#39;m in Rivervale and I<br/>\nhave currently 50 plats to my name. Would have more,<br/>\nbut 9th level spells are expensive fer a Druid... :O<br/>\n..(specially when you buy every one...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; How did I make<br/>\nall this money?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Hmm.. well, since I&#39;m a Druid<br/>\nI gave heals at the Wall. I never asked for<br/>\ndonations, but people gave me money anyway. And also I sang<br/>\nsongs for them. That earned me even more<br/>\nmoney....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ..And though I&#39;m a Druid, I must say, when you<br/>\nget to a higher level kill some bears. High Quality<br/>\nBear Skins can be sold for 15PP sometimes<br/>\nmore...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ..But... Just work on killing all you can, and<br/>\nsave some money in the bank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And basically,<br/>\nthis didn&#39;t help much at all....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But ah.. read<br/>\nthe other&#39;s posts! They seem to know what they&#39;re<br/>\ntalking about! :) ? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; and I know this says I&#39;m<br/>\nreplying to someone else, but I was too lazy to go back<br/>\nand type on another post....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; so.. For the<br/>\nperson worried about money: Don&#39;t sweat it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nTeppeny&lt;br&gt; Druid of the 10th&lt;br&gt; Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
