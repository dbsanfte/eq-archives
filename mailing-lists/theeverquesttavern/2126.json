I&#39;m now using a dagger of<br/>\ndropping that i bought from a Barb rogue (I could speak to<br/>\nhim in Thieves Cant, or i would have missed this<br/>\ngreat deal). With that, I could hunt wisps, and then<br/>\nsnuck my way to NK to turn in GLS at the gypsie camp--<br/>\nended up netting me about 50pp!!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So now I&#39;m<br/>\nlvl 14 with dual wield maxxed out, but still working<br/>\non max for Backstab. Oh, btw-- pickpocket is maxxed<br/>\nout too-- /grin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I brought a regular axe,<br/>\nwhich is pretty decent-- 1HS 6/31. I&#39;d like the gnoll<br/>\nhide just for the delay-- to keep up my 1HS, dual<br/>\nwield, and double attack when i get it at 16. I also use<br/>\nthrowing knives-- I&#39;v had a couple of 17dmg crits, and<br/>\njust think it&#39;s great for rollplaying. &quot;Rumble eyes<br/>\nyou coldly as he picks his teeth with a razor sharp<br/>\nknife.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as armor-- now that i have cash, i&#39;m looking<br/>\nfor some banded. Bought a gorget for 4pp (5ac, so I<br/>\nthought that was a good deal). The rest is leather and<br/>\npatchwork, as it&#39;s tough to find stuff at my level on this<br/>\nnew server. What i did do though is get that Freeport<br/>\nMilitia Tunic-- 9AC +3Dex-- which is pretty nice. It&#39;s<br/>\nred and i get inspected a lot-- plus I&#39;m amiable with<br/>\nthe militia, who seem follow my life tenents.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That BP from Kaladim sounds good, but I don&#39;t much<br/>\nlike dwarves, and stay as far away from gnomes as<br/>\npossible-- they give us short races a bad name, plus what&#39;s<br/>\nthe deal with thier lack of hair???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dragoon<br/>\nDirk is next on my list. I hear that D&#39;Vinn&#39;s evil<br/>\ncousin D&#39;ornn (or something like that) hangs out at a<br/>\ndervish camp in NRo and carries a Dirk as well. I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike sand much, but i&#39;m planning on making a trip<br/>\nthere soon anyway to see if a can trick some large<br/>\nburly types into helping me get it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The life of<br/>\na rogue is the way for me. EQ is all new now!!<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rumble&lt;br&gt;Good fer nuthin pickpocket of the 14th<br/>\nstation&lt;br&gt;Former dishwasher at Fool&#39;s Gold&lt;br&gt;Honorary Member of<br/>\nthe Freeport Militia&lt;br&gt;FV</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
