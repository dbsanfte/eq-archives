A few friends and<br/>\nI, all around 20, were fighting the yard trash in<br/>\nMistmoore, mostly enemies around 22-24 or so, nothing we<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t handle. Well there are some higher level people<br/>\nfighting in the castle itself, and they call a train. So<br/>\nmy party zones and after a few minutes we return.<br/>\nI&#39;m the last of three people in, and I get charmed by<br/>\nsome mob, forgot what it was. So I&#39;m basically this<br/>\nthing&#39;s pet. Somehow I end up from the courtyard to the<br/>\nmaid room, which is a huge jump in the level of mobs,<br/>\naround 20 or so. Still charmed, I see a friend of mine,<br/>\na 48 rogue, and 3 of his friends fighting 3 mobs.<br/>\nWell I start attacking them but I&#39;m luckily not<br/>\nhitting them much because I&#39;m such a low level. They get<br/>\ndown to about 2 mobs or so and, for some reason, I&#39;m<br/>\ncharmed to hit a pet in there. I conned it before I hit<br/>\nit, it was yellow to me. Anyway, whomever was<br/>\ncontrolling me made me hit the pet, and about 10 mobs flooded<br/>\nthe room. I killed everyone in there, including<br/>\nmyself. I felt like caca. But, luckily, those other<br/>\npeople in there forgave me relatively quickly and even<br/>\ngot my corpse to me. Here&#39;s a tip for anyone in<br/>\nMistmoore - leave the pets alone. Their masters will<br/>\nannihilate you if you touch them. They&#39;re usually non aggro,<br/>\nand I don&#39;t know why I was charmed into hitting it in<br/>\nthe first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Half elf warrior<br/>\nof 21 seasons&lt;br&gt;Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
