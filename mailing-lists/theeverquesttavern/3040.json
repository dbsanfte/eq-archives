I still think my favorite aspect is changing the <br/>\nhair, eyes, and colors... My woodelf and necro look damn good if you <br/>\nask me.

I never had it and will be<br/>\n&gt; starting EQ again in the next few months, but Before<br/>\n&gt; PoP came out you had to pay massive amounts of<br/>\n&gt; platinum to get teleported anywhere.  With a lot of<br/>\n&gt; the newbie quest armor you also have to get rare<br/>\n&gt; pieces which will be easier to handle if you can get<br/>\n&gt; to cities across the map without having to cross<br/>\n&gt; through the lvl 30+ areas to get there.  When I was a<br/>\n&gt; newbie I tried to cross the continent and got stuck in<br/>\n&gt; the Arena at lvl 9 and was bound (don&#39;t ask) there and<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t get out...  It was pure luck after 6 hours<br/>\n&gt; someone walked into the lake area..
