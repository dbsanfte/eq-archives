Go there and kill orcs in<br/>\na group or zone again in NRO and kill the<br/>\ntarantulas. You and one or two others should be able to<br/>\nhandle those just fine. Soon as you hit about 12 or 13,<br/>\nI recommend Cuthroats in NRO at camps 2 or<br/>\n3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heck, as a necro and using a fear, kite, skel tank, dot<br/>\ncombo... you probably could solo-- But I don&#39;t recommend<br/>\nit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? B/c at higher levels, grouping is the way to go.<br/>\nEQ is a group oriented game. Groups help you get<br/>\nover humps and make things more fun. (provided you are<br/>\na good grouper and that takes practice and other<br/>\nplayers to teach).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I play druid and love to group.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been worried b/c at higher levels (40 and above)<br/>\nit gets to the point that a good group really only<br/>\nneeds 2 melee classes, 2 clerics, a bard and an<br/>\nenchanter-- with either the bard or enchanter being<br/>\nswitchable with some other class-- probably nuker as long as<br/>\nthere&#39;s some mana regenerator in the group.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Versatility has it&#39;s price and have a friend lvl 46 shaman<br/>\nwho verified this... oh well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s why I<br/>\nrecommend you learn to group early. I&#39;ve developed a decent<br/>\nreputation as a fun and good grouper and that should help me<br/>\nlater on (assuming I ever have the time to play EQ<br/>\nmore.
