Verant has specifically said that they&#39;re<br/>\nnot asking for passwords. And regardless of being<br/>\nangry at Verant... most of their GM&#39;s don&#39;t have that<br/>\nkind of power. There are a few GM&#39;s that can swing<br/>\nthat kind of thing-- but as I understand it... most<br/>\ncan&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And worse yet... once they have your password, they<br/>\nhave your account. They change your password and it&#39;s<br/>\nessentially their account from then on. So even if it is<br/>\nlegit, I wouldn&#39;t risk it cause they could change my<br/>\npassword at anytime if I gave them my station name and<br/>\npassword.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatehue Prismatic&lt;br&gt;Catza Baby White<br/>\nTiger Warrior.
