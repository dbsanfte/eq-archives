The numbers in the game make a difference, but<br/>\nnot much of a difference at all. A skillful player<br/>\nwho knows how to use the abilities he has can be a<br/>\nlot more useful than an idiot with great stats ;)<br/>\nAlso, choose the combination that YOU want to play. For<br/>\nroleplaying, a challenge, or just to be unique, and choice can<br/>\nbe great. For example, I currently play a Gnome<br/>\nCleric. Looking at a gnomes stats, it seems a gnome<br/>\ncleric would be horrible. Low strength (Can&#39;t carry much<br/>\narmor around) and especially low wisdom (BARBARIANS<br/>\nhave a higher base wisdom!), seems that a gnome cleric<br/>\nwould be impossible to play, and useless to a group.<br/>\nWrong. I have gotten my cleric to level 26 and love<br/>\nplaying him every day. MANY people have said that Quinon<br/>\n(my cleric) is one of the best clerics they have ever<br/>\ngrouped with, eventhough he has pathetic wisdom. Everyone<br/>\nstresses the numbers, but don&#39;t let them bother you.<br/>\nAttributes that may not seem important to your class can<br/>\nstill be useful. Quinon&#39;s high agility allows him to<br/>\navoid being hit, and his high intelligence allows him<br/>\nto learn skills very quickly, eventhough these<br/>\nattributes aren&#39;t thought of as important to a cleric at<br/>\nall. Just choose the race/class you want and enjoy it,<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t going to ruin your characters usefullness<br/>\njust because of some numbers.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
