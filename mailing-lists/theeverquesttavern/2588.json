A few times when Unrest was too crowded or we <br/>\nwere sick of trains, we&#39;d head outside to this camp. Gobbies range in <br/>\nlevel, and occasionally the Tidal Lord will spawn, which is great xp. <br/>\nThey drop some average loot, but they constantly drop arrows, so you <br/>\ncan load up there on the way to Unrest too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of good places in old world-- some are out of the way, though, <br/>\nand you might want to form your own group.  Najena, SolA, SK, High <br/>\nPass, Everfrost, Oasis, Upper Guk to name just a few.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
