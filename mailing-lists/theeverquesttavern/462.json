There are few humans around - it&#39;s a<br/>\ngnoll-dominated place. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re fighting a gnoll that you<br/>\ncan beat. He may call a few gnoll friends of his to<br/>\nhelp out. Pretty soon, there&#39;s a large number of<br/>\ngnolls, so you decide to run. They chase after you in a<br/>\nline, a &quot;train&quot; of sorts. This often happens when you<br/>\nstumble into a den of monsters and run away. If you&#39;re<br/>\nrunning away and see some players along the way, tell<br/>\nthem - &quot;run - train!&quot; - they should know what that<br/>\nmeans. If you ever hear it, run with no question,<br/>\nespecially in rather difficult zones. Does this answer your<br/>\nquestion? Sorry so lengthy.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
