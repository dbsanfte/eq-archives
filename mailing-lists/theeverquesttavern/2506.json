It is sooo<br/>\nboring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grouping i would suggest the ever popular and crowded<br/>\nVelk&#39;s Lab, Chardok, Sebilis, Karnor&#39;s Castle, Fungus<br/>\nGrove, The Grey, Maiden&#39;s Eye, Scarlet Desert, or<br/>\nHowling Stones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solo i would prob attempt Howling<br/>\nStones, although it may still be a bit tough. I solod the<br/>\nentrance for awhile until i couldnt stand the boredom<br/>\nanymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Few more solo spots: Burning Woods and the Grey. Cant<br/>\nreally think of anymore (been awhile since I was lvl<br/>\n54).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
