And I am sort of confused on this subject I was wondering if I could get some second opinions....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends and I have always wondered what the most powerful monster in the game was. Well I did some research and I came up with a mob that I read about and it said you couldn&#39;t really kill it.  It was the Sleeper (aka Kerafrym).  I did some heavy reading at Alakhazam and they were talking about how no one has ever killed the Sleeper and I read about how the ancients were there to protect it and how you had to get through all the Ancients(all dragons) to get to the Sleeper.  But something really confused me when I was Reading on down they were talking about recently, how the Sleeper was released from its home in Velious by the Ancients and now resides in the Plane of Time.  Does anyone know if this is true or not?  And sorry I went into so much depth I just love the lore of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kryptorchid Kinderfield<br/>\n<br/>\nNecromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
