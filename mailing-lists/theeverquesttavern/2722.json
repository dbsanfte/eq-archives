Yes, they&#39;ll skin you alive even more <br/>\nquickly than the Wood Elves.  So will the Dwarves of Kaladim, if <br/>\nthat&#39;s the place you&#39;re thinking of (but the entrance to Kaladim is <br/>\nin the next zone over, Butcherblock Mountains).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice is just to be a Dark Elf SK and kill everything in sight, <br/>\nexcept your own people and maybe Ogre and Trolls.  Relish your evil, <br/>\nrevel in it.  You can always create an alt someday and go exploring <br/>\nthe good zones you&#39;ve never gotten to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKharlisht Kuzlidul, 28 Dwarf Rogue, semi-retired but thinking about <br/>\nmoving to Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In theeverquesttavern@y..., &quot;the_dark_elf_drizzt_do_urden&quot; <br/>\n&lt;joeyis007@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been killing orcs to build faction but so far it hasn&#39;t had an <br/>\n&gt; effect.
