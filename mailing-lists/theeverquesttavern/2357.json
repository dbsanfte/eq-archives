I have 320mb ram, which<br/>\nshould be more than enough to run EQ. I do have SoL but<br/>\nhave been installing and uninstalling it to see if I<br/>\ncan fix my problem which, btw, does not help. I also<br/>\nhave a cable modem so I KNOW I have a fast connection!<br/>\nBut even though I have enough memory and a good<br/>\ninternet connection I am STILL extremely laggy. It takes<br/>\nme forever to zone and I can hardly move in the<br/>\ngame. SoL apparently has nothing to do with it since it<br/>\nis the same whether it&#39;s installed or uninstalled.<br/>\nBut I DO have a pretty crappy video card. So, I was<br/>\nwondering if that was the problem,and if I got a better and<br/>\nnew video card if it would help make EQ run faster?<br/>\nOn a diff computer it had a better video card, a<br/>\nlittle slower of a connection, and just about the same<br/>\nmemory and it only took me 13 seconds to log into the<br/>\ngame! And it took no time to zone either. So does<br/>\nanyone think that if I get a little more memory, say<br/>\n516mb ram, and a better video card, that it will run<br/>\nfaster? Any info would be great! Seeing that I am getting<br/>\nmore frustrated every minute! Nothing seems to work<br/>\nfor me =(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
