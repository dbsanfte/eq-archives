Primarily I went to each area that<br/>\ncontains alot of skellies or creatures with weapons.<br/>\nSaving items and selling. I kill only greens at this<br/>\npoint as it&#39;s the easiest to collect the weaps. Another<br/>\nthing, I do this early early in the morning, usually<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t any other person in the area I am hunting,<br/>\nso as to not take the kills away from the levels the<br/>\nmobs are blue to. when I gain a couple hundred pp I go<br/>\nto the EC auction at a busy point of the day and<br/>\nauction for +wis items, stating my buying level. It&#39;s<br/>\namazing the number of people who are carrying around<br/>\nitems that they don&#39;t need or just don&#39;t want to have<br/>\nas weight. I&#39;ve gotten some incredibly good deals<br/>\nbecause people don&#39;t want to carry the item any more.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;Any way, what I guess I am trying to say is that<br/>\nrather than concentrating on leveling at first I<br/>\nconcentrate on getting the necessary equipment for my<br/>\ncharacter. It is something that pays off. My level 21 druid<br/>\nhas a 164 wis now. Makes medding sheer heck, but<br/>\nstill worth it. &lt;br&gt;*grin* Jessica</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
