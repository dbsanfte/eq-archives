I figured I would give it a peek<br/>\nso I grabbed a copy (About $7) of the mag and tried<br/>\nout AC. After an hour of updates, I finally got in.<br/>\nYes, I answered the Call, but I probably should have<br/>\nhung up! =P Frankly, the game was quite crummy. Nasty<br/>\nlag, bad graphics, unnerving interface, miserable chat<br/>\nsystem, the works. I was amused with a few things I might<br/>\nlike to see in EQ such as millions of choices for<br/>\nlooks and no zone lines (Actually, there are zone lines<br/>\n(Portals)to get into &quot;dungeons&quot;, but none throughout the main<br/>\nworld) Still, I would prefer EQ any day. Some might<br/>\nenjoy it, but it isn&#39;t my cup of tea and I&#39;m sure many<br/>\nothers will stick to Norrath rather than pack their<br/>\nbags, delete their characters, and move to<br/>\nDereth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just my thoughts =) I have just got done playing AC<br/>\nfor a little while and the boredom drove me to vent<br/>\nsome opinions! hehe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS I&#39;m aware that AC is<br/>\nonly in beta, but it is due to release in one month,<br/>\nso there isn&#39;t much that will be changed now.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
