How about starting a guild on that<br/>\nserver with people from the list (and you could even add friends of<br/>\npeople on this list to the guild as well)?   Even a step farther, if you<br/>\nwanted to, you could start a new Yahoo! Group with people from this<br/>\ngroup that decide to play on that server on it... :-)  That way, you<br/>\ncould keep in touch with in game happenings, etc.  I am game :-)  If<br/>\nanyone is interested in doing that, send me an email, and I can try and<br/>\nset it up (the new Yahoo!

I think that<br/>\nwould<br/>\nbe really neat. We could meet one day a week on these characters, that<br/>\nway<br/>\nwe can play our others too. I know some of you already have 5<br/>\ncharacters.<br/>\nBut you can delete to make a new character. I have done that to move to<br/>\ndifferent server. Now i only have 2 charcaters, so ie easy for me to go<br/>\nto<br/>\ndifferent server to make a new character. I thought this would be a neat<br/>\nidea, kinda like a club thing.... Well, let me know you guys what you<br/>\nthink<br/>\nand we can decide if we would like to try this.      Surreal <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmi would say first to go to www.eqdruids.com if you dont already <br/>\nknow about it. It is a terrific druid only site. In the messages <br/>\nboards they have sticky post about where to hunt at your general lvl. <br/>\nNot for sure but at 41 i think i was quadding snow cougers in ice <br/>\nclad or maybe the specs in oasis. After them i went to timoruos deep <br/>\nand started quadding spirocs. That took me to all the way to 51 xp <br/>\nslows down at about 50 51 on the spirocs but i know can take you to <br/>\n52 as i am about to ding it there. Or you can start trying the <br/>\nraptors in that same zone also. I havent tried them yet but read that <br/>\nit can be done. If you want to make some money and xp head to cobalt <br/>\nscar and quad the wyverns. Save the pelts and sell them in bazaar and <br/>\nsell the gems to vendors for about 40plat. This is a bit more <br/>\ndangerous and harder as there is always people there farming. Unless <br/>\nyou have killed alot of giants in velious and raised your claws of <br/>\nveeshan <br/>\nfaction you will be kos to the drakes there and they cast on you for <br/>\nlike 300 dam. Do not pull the named wyvern he cannot be slowed or <br/>\nsnared. As far as the wis items i just went to bazaar and filled in <br/>\nthe filters one of them you can pick wis and all wis items will come <br/>\nup then just shop away. It will be slow quadding till you get your <br/>\nnew aoe spell lightnig blast and lvl 45 when you can get kei then its <br/>\nsmooth sailing to 51. Oh there is a good quest wis book you can hold <br/>\nin your off hand adss like 10 wis and somethin other would be easy to <br/>\nobtain at you lvl. Sorry but i forgot the name of it next time im on <br/>\nill check but can prolly find it on the druid site. <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theeverquesttavern@yahoogroups.com\">theeverquesttavern@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sue &lt;kstiggermom@y...&gt; <br/>\nwrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ** sigh ** <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I guess I&#39;m the loner.
