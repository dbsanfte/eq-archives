This is my take<br/>\non it after using a wurmslayer for about 10<br/>\nlevels.&lt;br&gt;My level 39 Ranger is using a Centi Longsword in<br/>\nsecondary and Crystaline Short Sword in Primary. I don&#39;t<br/>\nreally like the CSS, but I love the Centi Longsword...<br/>\nFor level 35 I fought in Overthere and The Great<br/>\nDivide, but now with Luclin, there could be a better<br/>\nplace for you.&lt;br&gt;Good Luck!!&lt;br&gt;~Siai&lt;br&gt;45<br/>\nDruid&lt;br&gt;~Atrana&lt;br&gt;40 Warrior&lt;br&gt;~Twara&lt;br&gt;39 Ranger&lt;br&gt;~*~SARYRN~*~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
