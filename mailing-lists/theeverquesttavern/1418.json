I&#39;d love to meet up<br/>\nwith anyone who plays on Xev for some fun. I have 2<br/>\nchars - Xela is a lvl 16 wood elf druid, and Serrafina<br/>\nis a lvl 16 gnome mage. Serra is a member of the<br/>\nDefenders of Mithril Hall, but Xela has not found a home<br/>\nyet, and is looking for a guild to match his love of<br/>\nnature and worship of Mother Tunare. Please let me know<br/>\nif you have info on the Xev guilds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m also<br/>\nlooking for some good druid gear (there HAS to be<br/>\nsomething better than leather for my level), so please let<br/>\nme know what you think I should be searching for, if<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been here before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, i&#39;ve done a lot<br/>\nof research lately on tinkering and spell research<br/>\nfor my gnome. Let me know if you have questions, or<br/>\nadvice - as i&#39;m ready to jump in!! (actually, i think<br/>\ni&#39;ll wait till lvl 19 to start w/ research).<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go with Tunare!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela (soon to be Xela<br/>\nOrcbane)of Xev&lt;br&gt;16th season wood elf<br/>\ndruid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serrafina of Xev&lt;br&gt;16th season gnome mage</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
