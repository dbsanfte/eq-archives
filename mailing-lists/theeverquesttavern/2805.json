The reason given for <br/>\nthe request by the FAITH Copy Editor was both ignorant and <br/>\ndiscriminatory. &quot;The Salisbury Post FAITH section is for people who <br/>\nbelieve in God&quot; and &quot;this is not the image that The Post wants to <br/>\nportray.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Salisbury Post&#39;s mission statement says in part: <br/>\n&quot;We are a marketing and customer driven company whose mission is to <br/>\ninform, educate and entertain. We strive to mirror the unique <br/>\ncommunities we serve and offer responsible public forum.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe fail to see how denying a Pagan/Wiccan study group an equal space <br/>\nwith other congregations fulfills this mission statement. The <br/>\ndecision was made with personal prejudices and not handled with a <br/>\nprofessional demeanor. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of whether or not Paganism is The Salisbury Post&#39;s <br/>\nreligion, it is our religion. The Federal Government recognizes <br/>\nPaganism/Wicca, as an official religion. Military Courts of Justice <br/>\nin the U.S. have also found Wicca to be a valid religion, deserving <br/>\nof protection under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In <br/>\nthe case United States v. Phillips, (42 M.J. 346) in 1995) the <br/>\nconcurring opinion by Judge Wiss stated: &quot;First, Wicca is a socially <br/>\nrecognized religion. It is acknowledged as such by the Army. <br/>\nSee `Dept. of the Army (DA) Pamphlet 165-13-1, Religious Requirements <br/>\nand Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains&#39; <br/>\n(April 1980), revising A Pamphlet 165-13, `Religious Requirements and <br/>\nPractices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains&#39; <br/>\n(April 1978). Further, it is acknowledged as such in courts of law.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nPagans and Wiccans are a part of your community. We are your <br/>\nneighbors, your coworkers, your children&#39;s teachers; we are <br/>\nprofessionals, but most importantly we are your readers - your <br/>\ncustomers! As engraved on your building and imprinted on the <br/>\nOpinion/Editorial page of the paper &quot;The truth shall make you free&quot;; <br/>\nmisconceptions about pagans, and being denied access to public forum <br/>\nmakes it all the more difficult for the truth to make any of us free. <br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the fact that this request was handled in an unprofessional <br/>\nmanner and with personal bigotry, we, the undersigned, as well as <br/>\nmembers of our family and friends, who are both of the Christian and <br/>\nPagan faith will not support The Salisbury Post. We will no longer be <br/>\na part of your readership until this matter is reconciled with a <br/>\nformal apology and the list is made public in The Salisbury Post. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We are not evil. We don&#39;t harm or seduce people. We are not <br/>\ndangerous. We are ordinary people like you. We have families, jobs, <br/>\nhopes, and dreams. We are not a cult. This religion is not a joke. We <br/>\nare not what you think we are from looking at T.V. We are real. We <br/>\nlaugh, we cry. We are serious. We have a sense of humor. You don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to be afraid of us. We don&#39;t want to convert you. And please <br/>\ndon&#39;t try to convert us. Just give us the same right we give you--to <br/>\nlive in peace. We are much more similar to you than you think.&quot; - <br/>\nMargot Adler <br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely, <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Undersigned <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.petitiononline.com/MMoon/\">http://www.petitiononline.com/MMoon/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLove & Blessings!<br/>\n<br/>\nMari<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.yahoo.com/magickal_mari\">http://profiles.yahoo.com/magickal_mari</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************************************<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In theeverquesttavern@y..., &quot;nomie&quot; &lt;sasank@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; untrue<br/>\n&gt; witchcraft is a practice not a religion<br/>\n&gt; it has been found in various forms in all relgions<br/>\n&gt; so it is a science then<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and there is morality with out religion<br/>\n&gt; dogma is not morality<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; nomad<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: PsyKo <br/>\n&gt;   To: theeverquesttavern@y... <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, October 09, 2002 8:56 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [The EverQuest Tavern] Witches school casts spell on <br/>\nAlps / YAHOO NEWS!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   In my opinion (key phrase) witchcraft without<br/>\n&gt;   religious backing is like morality without religious<br/>\n&gt;   backing.

And, on another note,<br/>\n&gt;   certification in astrology, other than a historical<br/>\n&gt;   study CANNOT be deemed scientific without results<br/>\n&gt;   which may be CONSISTANTLY reproduced.

Anyone can learn to<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; become one,&quot; he <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; added. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Practitioners of witchcraft focus on the good in<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; life and the spirit, <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; and reject any connection with the devil, Starchel<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; said. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Since their beliefs date back to ancient times well<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; before the birth <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; of Jesus, witchcraft has no bond with the Christian<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; embodiment of <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; evil. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Witchcraft has got absolutely nothing to do with<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; the folklore image <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; of evil witches with green faces and warts on their<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; nose. It&#39;s about <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; becoming a rounded person who lives in harmony with<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; nature,&quot; said the <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; goatee-bearded druid. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; NO HOCUS-POCUS NOR HUNKUM BUNKUM <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; The headmaster stressed that his school, established<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; in 1998 for <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; wannabe witches and druids of 18 years and above,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; has no ties with <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; religious organisations nor follows any esoteric<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; movement. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; The syllabus originally lasted three years but has<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; now been revised <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; to a more flexible form to suit students&#39; busy time<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; schedules. In a <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; sign of the times, it teaches courses over the<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Internet as most of <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; its students live outside Austria. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; A student graduates with a venefica or veneficus<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; (from the Latin for <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; witch/druid) certificate after passing written exams<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; in seven modules <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; and submitting a final thesis. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; The first module focuses on awakening intuition,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; specifically on how <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; to find sources of energy in nature and how to<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; channel it. Other <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; modules are astronomy, astrology, botany, holistic<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; healing and ritual <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; magic. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Curriculum information on the school website<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; www.hexen-schule.de <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; shows there are no modules like the Defence Against<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; the Dark Arts <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; class which Harry Potter had to take in the Hogwarts<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; School of <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Some wannabe witches and druids are turned off<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; enrolling with us <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; when we tell them that our aim is to demystify<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; witchcraft,&quot; said <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Starchel, who is an information technology<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; specialist by profession. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;People do approach us hoping to learn how to fly on<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; a broomstick. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Then we have to disappoint them and explain that<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; it&#39;s much more <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; important to let the spirit fly -- to be able to<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; combine intellect <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; with the soul.&quot; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; The school has received a huge fillip from the Harry<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Potter books by <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; J.K. Rowling (news - web sites) and television<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; series such as Sabrina <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; the Teenage Witch. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;We actually had kids phoning up asking whether they<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; could ditch <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; their school and enrol with us,&quot; Starchel said. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; THE WITCHES OF KLAGENFURT <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Student witch Katharina, a bespectacled middle-aged<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; librarian by day <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; who asked to be identified only by her witch name,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; said she was drawn <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; to the course because something was missing from her<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; life. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;I was looking for direction. Christianity was too<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; narrow for me and <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; didn&#39;t give me the answers I needed,&quot; she said after<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; completing a <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; session of chakra meditation with Danaketh. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Chakras are the seven key energy centres of the body<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; according to <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Indian medicine. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;I was a bit sceptical at first but what impressed<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; me is that it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; not about belief or faith as in the church. The<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; school offers <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; plausible explanations for phenomena based on fact<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; -- there&#39;s no <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; hocus-pocus,&quot; Katharina said. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Katharina, who travels from Salzburg in the<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; northwest of the country <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; to attend the school&#39;s seminars, proudly shows off<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; an array of <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; bottles, vials and flasks with home-brewed potions,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; elixirs and <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; fragrant creams with which she treats her friends. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;At first my friends and family ridiculed me for<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; wanting to become a <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; witch. But now they come to me for one of my potions<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; to soothe a <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; cough or whatever,&quot; she said. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Like Katharina, aspiring witch Saltah embraced the<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; craft three years <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; ago due to a thirst for knowledge. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;It started off as curiosity about mushrooms and<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; herbs, but then I <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; realised that I simply wanted answers to so many<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; things I couldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; comprehend and that this school could provide me<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; with them,&quot; said <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Saltah, who is in her mid-20s. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Both women said the course was challenging<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; intellectually as <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; witchcraft covered a swath of subjects. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Just learning and completing the syllabus doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; make you a witch. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; You&#39;ve got to work at it day in day out,&quot; Saltah<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; said. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;It&#39;s going to take me another 20 years before I can<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; truly call <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; myself a witch,&quot; said Katharina, hunched over a<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; toadstool. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   === message truncated ===<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;   Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;   Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
