So,<br/>\nyesterday I got 2 new jobs to replace the one lost. <br/>\nOne, at the Pancake Palace, and the other at Arby&#39;s,<br/>\nand though with this setup of jobs, sleep will be a<br/>\nrare commodity, I&#39;ll still try to make time for EQ... <br/>\nBesides who needs more than 3 hours of sleep in any<br/>\ngiven day anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the support, guys  PsyKo<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
