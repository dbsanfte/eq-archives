There is no way to contact an actual person, email customer service, or an address! In other words they built a wall to protect themselves. I don&#39;t have the money to pay them either. I was expecting the $15 not what they have on their records! What am I suppose to do? File bankruptcy so they don&#39;t screw me in the future I have set for myself to &quot;MAYBE&quot; save money, build credit, and buy a house someday where there aren&#39;t neighbors from hell, that their apartment smells so bad that it literally burns my nose, but a manager that &quot;won&#39;t&quot; actually do anything... I thought that if I was a &quot;good&quot; girl, kept to myself, and worked hard life or BULLY COMPANIES LIKE EBAY wouldn&#39;t keep bending me over... anyone have some spare KY Jelly?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n._.~*~._.~*~.Beverly R._.~*~._.~*~.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.O.
