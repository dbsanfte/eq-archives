The reason I asked about the<br/>\ninstall thing is because I lag really bad in some places<br/>\n(like the Butcherblok Docks) and I just sit there<br/>\nloading. I can never move nor camp. Eventually I am forced<br/>\nto manually shut down. One time, I was lagging at<br/>\nthe docks and was killed by an aqua goblin. If I had<br/>\ntried to get my stuff, I would have froze again. It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a big deal (thanks to my &quot;monk&quot;iness), but a good<br/>\nfriend helped me out and looted for me (thanks<br/>\nMinamas!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, I am needing to learn some moves I am<br/>\noverdue on. If anyone can teleport me to Freeport I would<br/>\nbe very gratefull.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
