I just started<br/>\ngrouping in earnest once I got backstab, and I&#39;ve been in<br/>\nUnrest for the last couple of levels. Nice thing there<br/>\nis that it&#39;s small enough that you see the same<br/>\npeople regularly, so you can group with them and learn<br/>\ntheir style. Or learn what you don&#39;t like about them.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s also a thread on groups on the Everlore Rogue<br/>\nboard. Not nearly so erudite (!) as your post, but fun.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me know if/when (I hope it&#39;s &quot;when&quot;) you get back<br/>\nto Everquest.
