Just did the cougarskin mask (AC6 +2agi +2dex<br/>\n+10hp) and direwolf cloak (AC7 +5str) quest last night<br/>\nin Iceclad. Very easy and the items are pretty good<br/>\nconsidering the ease of aquiring the correct items. They<br/>\ncertainly beat the banded armor items i was<br/>\nwearing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think im next going to my enchanted bow quest.<br/>\nSeems pretty easy for the most part with the exception<br/>\nof killing the mermaid in Kedge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;all ideas<br/>\nand suggestions are open )</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
