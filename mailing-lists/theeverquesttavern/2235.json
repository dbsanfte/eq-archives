The best advice I can give<br/>\nyou is to go to the mall or department store (i went<br/>\nto BestBuy) and purchase Primas guide to EQ Ruins of<br/>\nKunark. It will cost around $17 or so but is well worth<br/>\nthe money. I have been playing for over a year now<br/>\nbut still regularly refer to the guide for info. Also<br/>\nit has a list of web sites you can use for more<br/>\nindepth info such as quests.
