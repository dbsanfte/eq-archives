I have made several Hotkeys that<br/>\ngive OOC speaches advertising my Port destinations,<br/>\nand also asking for donations. Asking for donations<br/>\nusually gets you more than the price you would ask, and<br/>\nyou (almost) never get someone who refuses to<br/>\npay...they know that there is a price up front. If someone<br/>\nis just broke and desperate, I&#39;m always happy to<br/>\ngive them a port to help out. Asking for donations is<br/>\na good way to avoid the &quot;Gee...I thought it was for<br/>\nfree&quot; thing, and everyone is happy.
