I thought it was a very interesting and<br/>\ncreative idea. If you weren&#39;t aware, this zone is not for<br/>\nhunting. On the contrary, it is actually a zone entirely<br/>\ndevoted to quest distribution. This zone gives quests for<br/>\nnecromancers, magicians, wizards, enchanters, bards, and<br/>\nclerics. The zone looks really great with all sorts of<br/>\nlava spouts and rivers all over (Be careful! Fall in<br/>\nthe lava and you might find yourself trapped while<br/>\nyou are burned to death!) Unfortunately, all of the<br/>\nquests are sort of high. For example, each of the quests<br/>\nfor clerics that will give you a piece of cleric only<br/>\narmor, requires 2 or 3 enchanted platinum bars!<br/>\nUnenchanted bars cost about 125pp EACH! Oh well, guess it&#39;s<br/>\ntime to do some leveling, hehe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those of you<br/>\nnot listed among those sponsered inthe Temple, do not<br/>\ndespair! Monks are warriors already have their quests<br/>\n(Sashes/headbands and crafted) Rangers can obtain their new armor<br/>\nquests at the ranger guild in Kithicor, Shadowknights<br/>\nget theirs in Mistmoore, Rogues get theirs in Cazic<br/>\nThule, and druids in the rathe mountains. Still don&#39;t<br/>\nknow about shamen and paladins....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s my<br/>\nlittle update. Go check out the new Temple. It is pretty<br/>\ncool =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
