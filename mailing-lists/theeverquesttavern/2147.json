I would go link dead and then<br/>\nnot be able to get back on. I would also lose sound<br/>\nand it wouldnt come back until i backed out<br/>\ncompletely. If it wouldnt let me back on i had to back out,<br/>\ndisconnect from my isp, reconnect and then i could get back<br/>\non. I went to my local computer store and bought a<br/>\n$40.00 sound blaster modem and never had a problem<br/>\nagain. I have since switched to cable modem, it rocks!!<br/>\nHope you solve the problem.
