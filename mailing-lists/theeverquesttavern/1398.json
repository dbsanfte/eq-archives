Target something by clicking<br/>\non it (or hit F8 to target the nearest &quot;MoB&quot;<br/>\n(monster)), and then hit /c, or the Consider button.

Beyond that, count on the kindness of strangers .<br/>\n. . including the guards, of course, but also<br/>\nfellow players. Most are pretty helpful, I&#39;ve found.<br/>\nNeed a guide around Kelethin&#39;s annoying platforms?<br/>\nJust ask, and someone is likely to come around.
