Monks are<br/>\nsimilar, although Rogues have more problems b/c they need<br/>\nbackstab. Rangers tank better but still-- I&#39;d group them<br/>\njust slightly better than Rogues and Monks in tanking<br/>\nand they do a lot less damage. However, their spells<br/>\nare pretty cool in different situations. (SoW,<br/>\nsnares, etc).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors tank well but end up doing<br/>\nlike only what-- 10% or less of total damage at higher<br/>\nlevels? Wizzies do a ton of damage, but can&#39;t find a<br/>\ngroup worth their salt and can&#39;t solo very well even<br/>\nwith Root and Snare. (A properly timed wizzie deals I<br/>\nguess 25% of the damage and can waste their mana if<br/>\nneed be to pull ppl&#39;s behind out of the fire in a<br/>\npinch).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the more I see Wizzies in play-- the more I<br/>\nrealize that they are the hardest class to play.<br/>\nEnchanters are also very hard to play but have soooo much<br/>\nutility-- they&#39;re never without groups. Which makes things<br/>\neasier. Plus they have very easy to define roles for<br/>\ntiming. Mezz, Haste, Clarity, etc. Wizzies have to learn<br/>\ntiming and that&#39;s HARD. Very hard. Knowing when to hit<br/>\nthat mob for 250 points of damage can be tricky.<br/>\n(sorry to be so wordy.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Necro&#39;s are GREAT soloers<br/>\nbut dang... in a group-- sometimes they aren&#39;t more<br/>\nthan mana batteries. They&#39;re okay still around 30 but<br/>\nI&#39;ve been told around 40... they and Shaman start to<br/>\nslow down. Shaman at least still have lotsa stuff<br/>\ngroups can use. SoW, Debuffs, Buffs, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Druids<br/>\nare good all around but can a lot of times feel<br/>\nuseless. We don&#39;t do anything super-well and lotsa ppl do<br/>\nthings better than us. I can usually find something to<br/>\ndo in a group though. And if need be, I can solo-- I<br/>\njust hate doing it and don&#39;t do it well b/c I never<br/>\npractice it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What class am I missing? Covered<br/>\nShaman, Rogue, Warrior, Monk, Ranger, Druid, Wizzies,<br/>\nEnchants, and Necros. Ahh.. Magicians. Great pets-- but<br/>\neach has their flaws. Root is both a blessing in a<br/>\ncurse. Great when overwhelmed... pitiful when one at a<br/>\ntime and snaring. Etc etc. Bards-- great in groups--<br/>\ndecent solo. Bards are good all around characters but<br/>\ntwisting can get tiring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over all, I&#39;d rate class<br/>\nbalancing pretty good except for Enchanters and Bards. But<br/>\nI love those two groups too much to complain. Grin.<br/>\nThose who&#39;ve grouped with them -- know. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A<br/>\ncombination of any classes makes for a fun group-- as long as<br/>\nit&#39;s a full group. I&#39;ve had a group of Wizzie, 2<br/>\nDruid, 2 Shaman, and an Enchanter and we killed faster<br/>\nthan any group I&#39;ve ever been in. (Group<br/>\nbouncing/kiting)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Play whatever you&#39;re comfort with. Some ppl keep<br/>\ntelling me about the weaknesses of their characters at<br/>\nhigher levels. Least complaints come from Bards and<br/>\nEnchanters. But man... almost any combo of melee and casters<br/>\ncan work. (under normal non-uber mob situations-- ei<br/>\nDragon Raids, etc).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love groups-- full<br/>\ngroups... 20% bonus to exp and more if you&#39;re grouped with<br/>\nhybrids b/c of the way they add to exp when there are<br/>\nhybrid classes. My advice of course is &quot;Group group<br/>\ngroup and just enjoy your role and make friends.&quot; If<br/>\nyou know your role well... you should do well.<br/>\nFriends will look for you to do things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>\nout&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic of Drinal--&lt;br&gt;starving from a 3-4 week<br/>\nhectic schedule making for no Everquest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS...<br/>\nthat of course-- explains my rambling.&lt;br&gt;Love<br/>\ngroups-- Everything from Bard/Enchant combo&#39;s, to<br/>\nBard/Snare/Rogue combos, to group getting mobs of Rogues, to Druid<br/>\ntricks, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Group group group! =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
