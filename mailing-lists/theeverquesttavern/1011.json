Creating Guilds If you decide that none of the existing guilds are ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-59345190\">There is no need to be rude, we are here to help<br/>\npeople, not become rude....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creating Guilds<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you decide that none of the existing guilds are<br/>\nquite what you are looking for, you may found your own<br/>\nguild. In order to establish your guild you must have an<br/>\nacceptable name, charter, and a membership of 10 players who<br/>\nwish to form this guild. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following process<br/>\nneeds to be followed to gain approval for you<br/>\nguild:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The person who is to be the leader of the guild must<br/>\nenter the chat server and issue the #makeguild command.<br/>\nThis will create a private guild channel. The name of<br/>\nthe guild should be used as the name of the channel,<br/>\nalthough this name can be edited later during the creation<br/>\nprocess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the channel has been created, the guild leader<br/>\nneeds to invite the members of his guild into the<br/>\nchannel. To do this he needs to tell the guild members the<br/>\nname of the channel and the password for<br/>\naccess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once a total of 10 members are in the channel and have<br/>\nissued the #guildapprove command, the guild leader can<br/>\nthen issue the #makeguild command. This will move the<br/>\nguild leader to the guild creation screen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In<br/>\nthe guild creation screen, the guild leader needs to<br/>\nenter a summary of the guild∩┐╜s charter. This summary<br/>\nshould focus on the guild∩┐╜s role in Norrath and the<br/>\ngoals it will pursue. Details of the internal working<br/>\nof your guild need not be included. You may also<br/>\nedit your guild∩┐╜s name in this screen. Once completed,<br/>\nhit FINISH and the guild will be submitted for<br/>\napproval.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The leader of the guild may check the status of the<br/>\nguild by activating the GUILDS button from chat. If the<br/>\nstatus of the guild indicates a need for revision, the<br/>\nguild leader should select his guild and hit the EDIT<br/>\nbutton. Comments regarding the nature of the needed<br/>\nrevision appear at the bottom of the guild creation<br/>\nscreen. The guild leader can edit the charter and the<br/>\nguild name as needed and hit the FINISH button to<br/>\nresubmit the guild for approval. IMPORTANT: If the leader<br/>\nis only viewing the revisions needed, hit CANCEL to<br/>\nexit this screen. If the leader hits FINISH the guild<br/>\nwill be resubmitted for approval and the leader will<br/>\nbe unable to re-enter the guild creation/edit<br/>\nscreen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the name and charter have been approved, the<br/>\nguild leader will be notified via email that the guild<br/>\nis ready to be created. Please verify that your<br/>\nemail is correct in our files by going to<br/>\naccount:change account:edit registration from the login<br/>\nscreen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the guild leader has received notification that<br/>\nthe guild has been approved, it is his responsibility<br/>\nto petition and meet the GM of his server between<br/>\n2pm and 11pm P.S.T. to complete the guild creation<br/>\nprocess.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
