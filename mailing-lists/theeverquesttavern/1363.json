They both have fine attributes. I like<br/>\nthe shammy because he can now heal for 300 per shot<br/>\nand can have SOW whenever he wants. On the other<br/>\nhand, I like the Wizzard for his pure offensive power<br/>\nand his ability to gate to a lot of zones. He is a<br/>\ndeffinate plus in any group. However, if you decide to make<br/>\na wizzy be aware that you will probably have to<br/>\nsolo for most of your low levels. Good luck my friend<br/>\nin whatever you<br/>\ndecide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reptilious/Wizzkid&lt;br&gt;Xegony Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
