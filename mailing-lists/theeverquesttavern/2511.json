Xev is one of the newest non-pvp, non<br/>\nspecialty (UK or role play perferred) servers. It is still<br/>\nnearly a year and a half old, though, and is becoming<br/>\nmore like the other servers-- crowded at times, fights<br/>\nfor camp spots, lots of uber twinkage. BUT the<br/>\npopulation still seems to be lower than most, and I still<br/>\ngroup with a lot of new players when I play my alts.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I abondoned all other servers a year ago, with the<br/>\nexception of:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sullon Zek-- still gotta get my PVP on<br/>\nevery once in a while. Yes, Ogre shammies can Kite.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firiona Vie-- Very fun server with a tight knit community<br/>\nof mostly roll-players. Rule set is sometimes a<br/>\nhindrance, but can also be fun-- nothing is No Drop, so lots<br/>\nof good trading for stuff you wouldn&#39;t normally<br/>\nfind. Also, there next to no twinkage, because you can<br/>\nonly have 1 char-- so people marvel at me for being in<br/>\nfull banded-- haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your thoughts??</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
