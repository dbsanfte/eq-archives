A bard will never do<br/>\nalot of damage with just hand to hand, but if you&#39;re<br/>\nin a group with a couple tanks, by all means put<br/>\naway that sword and equip your drum and play away.<br/>\nYou&#39;re probably more valuable to the group as a sort of<br/>\ncaster, twisting chant of battle, chords of dissonance if<br/>\nyou can safely without pulling more mobs, and be<br/>\nready with the Hymn of Restoration if needed and Selo&#39;s<br/>\nif your party has to make a break for it. You&#39;ll<br/>\nwant to try to keep both hand to hand and your chosen<br/>\nweapon skill/skills maxed as much as you can, (not an<br/>\neasy task as you level quickly for the early levels).<br/>\nAfter the tanks put some damage on the mob, however,<br/>\nyou can step in and start swinging fists without<br/>\ndoing enough damage to taunt them off the tanks. Chords<br/>\nof Dissonance seems to taunt them nicely though,<br/>\nwhich could be good or bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some invaluable<br/>\ninformation I&#39;ve found can be seen<br/>\nat:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper target=new&gt;http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/playguides/bard/ target=new&gt;http://eq.castersrealm.com/playguides/bard/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a ton more listed at<br/>\nallazhazam&#39;s..&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com target=new&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kullervo&lt;br&gt;Half-Elf Bard of 7 songs&lt;br&gt;Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
