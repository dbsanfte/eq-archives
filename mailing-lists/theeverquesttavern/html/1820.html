<b>Subject:</b> Starting over <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595471078">Yes. I want to start COMPLETELY over. Different<br/>
character...possible a different server. I want to play with people<br/>
who roleplay. I am very new to roleplaying but enjoy<br/>
getting into it. I want to play with people that help<br/>
each other...and those who refuse to help those<br/>
classes and or races that they are&quot;supposed&quot; to hate! But<br/>
again...i dont want to play on a PVP server. Most people<br/>
are on there just to mess with people. There are some<br/>
great players on PVP servers...just that the jerks<br/>
outweight the rest for me. Am i a freak here? Is there<br/>
anyone out there who would care to bring me in? Thank<br/>
you all for your time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Sarah</div>
