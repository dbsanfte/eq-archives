<br/>
When things go wrong and they sometimes will,<br/>
When the road you&#39;re trudging seems all uphill,<br/>
When funds are low and debts are high,<br/>
And you want to smile but only sigh,<br/>
When care is pressing you down a bit,<br/>
Rest if you must, but don&#39;t you quit.<br/>
<br/>
Life is strange with its twists and turns,<br/>
As every one of us sometimes learns,<br/>
And many a failure turns about,<br/>
When he might have won had he stuck it out,<br/>
Don&#39;t give up though the pace seems slow,<br/>
You may succeed with another blow.<br/>
<br/>
Success is failure turned inside out,<br/>
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br/>
And you can never tell how close you are,<br/>
It seems so near when it seems so far;<br/>
So stick to the fight when hardest hit,<br/>
It&#39;s when things go wrong that you must not quit.<br/>
