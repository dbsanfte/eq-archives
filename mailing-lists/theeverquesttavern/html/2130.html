<b>Subject:</b> Twinking again? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240461973">Lots of peeps talk about twinking here....some<br/>
for some against. Me i am for it. I worked hard on my<br/>
first character and he has a lot of items that he can&#39;t<br/>
use but are just great for my noob<br/>
characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean lets face it..that first character is a lot<br/>
of hard work but full of learning<br/>
experience...anybody starting a new character after leveling the first<br/>
up 20 or 30 levels knows how to best level up the<br/>
new one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I earned everything i gave my new<br/>
characters and i really don&#39;t think of it as twinking...i<br/>
mean c&#39;mon what i get with one character is mine...if<br/>
i choose to give to one of my alts thats my<br/>
choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;just a few thoughts from a 31 chanter on rodcet<br/>
nife.&lt;br&gt; Calidiel Shapeshyfter</div>
