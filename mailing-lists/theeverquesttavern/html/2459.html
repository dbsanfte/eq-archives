<div id="ygrps-yiv-41348653">Actually, I didn&#39;t know they still sold 10 slot<br/>
items through vendors since they took out the 10 slot<br/>
sewing kits. I only have like two or three of those.<br/>
=/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Got a friend who had filled his whole bank and<br/>
inventory with those things so he has like 17 or 18 of<br/>
those things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I&#39;ll fill my bank with those<br/>
Thurg toolboxes and carry tailored on myself.<br/>
Grin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh... and btw. Here&#39;s an interesting lesser known piece<br/>
of info about Harmony. Many druids still scoff at me<br/>
for this but...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harmony yourself at lower<br/>
levels. Then sit and watch your mana bar. It will fill up<br/>
slightly faster than normal. It&#39;s by no means a Clarity or<br/>
even a Breeze... but when you&#39;re a poor Druid watching<br/>
your tank dying-- wishing you could get off just one<br/>
more heal cause then ya&#39;ll could get him about 1 bub<br/>
of health and taunt off the mobs...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah.<br/>
That&#39;s when I loved harmony the most at say level 5 to<br/>
20 (although by 20 it was almost pointless) and<br/>
especially at Aviak city. I learned about the mana thing<br/>
about two years ago on a post on Everlore or something<br/>
like that. Got me curious and I tested it. Lo and<br/>
behold... I thought I noticed a difference. I could be<br/>
crazy but I still firmly believe I saw a difference. I<br/>
haven&#39;t tried it in so long though. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
