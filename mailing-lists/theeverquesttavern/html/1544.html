<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967528741">As a newbie to everquest (I&#39;m a lvl 10<br/>
druid...when do I NOT become a newbie? ;) ), I have not<br/>
accepted nor asked for twinking. I&#39;m still in just leather<br/>
armor, can barely scape up enough plat to buy<br/>
spells...in fact, I&#39;ve still not bought some level 5 spells<br/>
due to this fact. But, it requires me to learn the<br/>
game by using limited resources wisely...oh, I did<br/>
play another druid as my first character and did<br/>
scrounge 14 gold off of him and a cloth belt and a<br/>
backpack before deleting him, but I think most would<br/>
agree, that&#39;s about like drinking an O&#39;Douls and saying<br/>
that you had a beer...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow, the game is<br/>
great. I do enjoy the ROLE-playing aspect of being a<br/>
druid...I was even thrilled to be the highest level<br/>
character in an orc-hill run (I was level 9) and considered<br/>
the &quot;TANK&quot; of the group...ha!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take<br/>
care,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jim&lt;br&gt;CoJim - Druid of the 10th season, Prexus server.</div>
