<div id="ygrps-yiv-857133884">Hello all! Ok. Lesser Faydark has probably been<br/>
corrupted on all servers now. Here&#39;s my observation on The<br/>
Rathe:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lots of undead sprite class creatures flying<br/>
around. Most are green to me at 26. However, the Undead<br/>
Sprite Horrors WILL attack you. They are very<br/>
aggressive! They harm touch for 171. They also sometimes proc<br/>
rejuvenate during combat. This will fully heal you and<br/>
recharge your mana! Quite weird! They also cast clinging<br/>
darkness. This makes you move like you are snared and also<br/>
drops all speed buffs including wolf form!&lt;br&gt; Of<br/>
course, dropping wolf form makes the brownies want to<br/>
kill you! Try to keep cancel magic and wolf form<br/>
memmed if possible. &lt;br&gt; The U.S. Guards/Guardians drop<br/>
twice woven silk, twice woven cloak and power of earth,<br/>
all for mage quests. &lt;br&gt; Good exp for a good hunter.<br/>
I went from 25 to 26 in about 6 hours. Made about<br/>
130pp. This was all solo work. Went in last night for<br/>
about 60 min, just under a yellow bubble and 20 pp. Not<br/>
fast but fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye Cousteau&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Wolf<br/>
