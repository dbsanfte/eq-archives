<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084338715">Yes, Shahazred, I understand asking for<br/>
donations. I have never had a problem when I advertise. I am<br/>
talking about when people ask ME for a port. They should<br/>
pay if they ask! If they tell me beforehand that they<br/>
can&#39;t pay, that&#39;s no problem. When they ask for a port,<br/>
and then decide not to pay is when I get mad. It&#39;s a<br/>
matter of manners.&lt;br&gt;On a happier note, I held a raid<br/>
in CT last night with my guild; we got a very nice<br/>
turnout. But I made it to 35 while we were there! Finally,<br/>
my second hell lvl, and so far it looks much worse<br/>
than 30.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanissa Noryk of Norraths<br/>
