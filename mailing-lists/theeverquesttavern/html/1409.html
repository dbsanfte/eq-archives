<b>Subject:</b> A few questions on double jeopardy lvls <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-223339068">Well ive made it through my 2nd hell lvl<br/>
(35)....now on to 36. I have died 6 times now in 36 and lost<br/>
a bubble every time....it sux. Well im clear on<br/>
that but not clear on a few other things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. I<br/>
seem to not be connecting as much or hitting as hard.<br/>
examplei normally hit for 70-78 in this lvl i cant seem to<br/>
hit for more than 38 or so ...with the occasional hit<br/>
that im used to&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. mobs seem to be resisting<br/>
alot more&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/shrug i dunno what the deal is<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;im still fighting same mobs ....but it just seems so<br/>
much harder and easier to die &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;oh well any<br/>
suggestions or answer would be appreciated.</div>
