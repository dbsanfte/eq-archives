place on dial up speed is 115k  which is available<br/>
using a tweaked 56k modem.  I am running AOL atm at<br/>
115k once got it up to 234k but I recieved an<br/>
interesting E-Mail from an unknown source telling me<br/>
my speed had been cut back down to 115k... But, as<br/>
long as i stay off during peak hours AKA 60ppl per<br/>
zone, im fine.  My advice for using a 56k modem tho is<br/>
fight as a melee only class... spells are a great<br/>
source of lag, and Good Luck if you wanna try playing<br/>
a bard LMAO that was my first mistake.  GL and Have<br/>
fun, Marshun PsyKo<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To break it down into layman&#39;s terms, the game<br/>
&gt; relies heavily on data <br/>
&gt; transfer between your PC and its server. Therefore,<br/>
&gt; connection speed <br/>
&gt; is paramount. ;) Dial-up is one of the slowest<br/>
&gt; connections you can <br/>
&gt; have (if you use AOL I pity you). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you really want to spend the money, you could<br/>
&gt; upgrade to DSL. It&#39;s <br/>
&gt; roughly about the same price you&#39;ll pay for AOL<br/>
&gt; (depending on where <br/>
&gt; you get DSL from), or if you have Cable service<br/>
&gt; available, get that. <br/>
&gt; Dial-up transfers up to 56K per second. DSL and<br/>
&gt; Cable are 10 times <br/>
&gt; faster than that and more if you have a good modem<br/>
&gt; and cable.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It works on dialup, but my boyfriend got cable<br/>
&gt; modem to play <br/>
&gt; recently and he LOVES it even more now, I am still<br/>
&gt; stuck with dialup <br/>
&gt; and see the different in speed and most defidently<br/>
&gt; graphics.<br/>
