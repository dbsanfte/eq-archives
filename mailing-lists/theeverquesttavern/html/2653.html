<div id="ygrps-yiv-51551116">haven&#39;t read or posted in a long time. Getting tired fingers typing <br/>
on all the boards I&#39;m on. LOL. I&#39;ve discovered a saturation point.<br/>
<br/>
However on EQ. I&#39;ve been playing since just a few months after <br/>
release. I&#39;ve still only got a 44 druid as my highest. But that&#39;s not <br/>
really too much of a concern for me as one might thing. <br/>
<br/>
But you have to get used to watching your friends pass you by and <br/>
wonder why you&#39;re such a slow poke if you don&#39;t play too much. <br/>
heheheh. =) If you can get over that, you can still have a blast!<br/>
