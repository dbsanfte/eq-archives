<div id="ygrps-yiv-816831748">Quest item-- no drop so there&#39;s no price ---<br/>
EXCEPT on the FV server, and I haven&#39;t seen them for<br/>
sale... YET. FV is going to be rockin&#39; soon because of<br/>
all the cool items that are no drop on others<br/>
servers, but CAN be traded on FV (like the Jboots).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;List your fav No-Drop items and your thoughts on how<br/>
much they&#39;ll cost on FV. As far as i know, very few<br/>
items at all will be no-drop on FV-- the only ones i&#39;ve<br/>
heard of are the epics and some high level quest items.<br/>
