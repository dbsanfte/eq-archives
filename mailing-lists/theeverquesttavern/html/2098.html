<div id="ygrps-yiv-164878067">Handing in your book to the priest of discord<br/>
gets you one thing; you now can kill or be killed by<br/>
other players with red names above their heads. Nothing<br/>
else changes. No added bonuses. If you don&#39;t play on a<br/>
PvP server it really isn&#39;t worth it. And on PvP<br/>
players you don&#39;t have to hand in the book anyway. Very<br/>
few people become PK&#39;ers on standard servers.<br/>
Remember you can only kill other players with RED names.<br/>
So it&#39;s really pretty lame. If you want to try a PvP<br/>
server I highly recommend Sullon Zek. I&#39;m having a blast<br/>
there as an Iksar warrior. I can&#39;t wait to kick some<br/>
nuetral druid butt!! ^_^</div>
