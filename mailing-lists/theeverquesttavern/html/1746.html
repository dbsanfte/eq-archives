<div id="ygrps-yiv-158043778">They reduced the price of the game, you can get<br/>
EQ for 9.99 now, as far as explaining it, well I&#39;m<br/>
sure it has some similarities with AC (I have never<br/>
played it). I suggest doing the tutorial to familiarize<br/>
yourself with traveling and commands. You should get first<br/>
month free (do they still do that?) so that should give<br/>
ya plenty of time to check it out. I play on the<br/>
E&#39;ci server and have several chars, my main one is<br/>
Jonquil, look me up if that&#39;s the server you play on. I<br/>
have a bunch of chars in the lvl4-10 range. Have fun<br/>
in the land of Norrath!!</div>
