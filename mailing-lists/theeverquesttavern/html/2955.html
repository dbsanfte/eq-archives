<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611055642">Greetings fellow creatures of Norrath.  Just introducing myself.  I have been playing EverQuest since June of 2002.  Can&#39;t really say that this game is easy, I have had some problems (for instance dying in every zone).  But I guess you have to live and learn.  I don&#39;t know many secrets about the game, but just throw basically any topic at me and I will comment on it.  But for now just introducing myself.<br/>
