<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-978783072">thanks for the empathy and good wishes:) I can<br/>
understand the reasoning behind what you said alot more than<br/>
what I was told of illegial activites like selling on<br/>
ebay/ still I think &lt;br&gt;exceptions should be made for<br/>
people who missed&lt;br&gt;a move because of rl problems.<br/>
Also, I understand and agree with your comments on<br/>
people who pl and twink without learning how to play the<br/>
game, it can be very frustrationg to get in a group<br/>
with total idiots who have no clue how to assist so<br/>
that chanters can mezz, and who target the creatures<br/>
the chanter just mezzed leaving something else<br/>
hitting the cleric or chanter, I &lt;br&gt;play both classes so<br/>
I get it no matter what I do.&lt;br&gt;Most mobs go for<br/>
chanters and clerics first..they just hate us, and we get<br/>
very bitter when we die due to idiots unmezzing and<br/>
not assisting all the time.</div>
