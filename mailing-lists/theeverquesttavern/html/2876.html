&gt; &gt;      I was just wondering on the status of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; proposed mage guild on <br/>
&gt; &gt; the tribunal server.  I started a DE mage and was<br/>
&gt; &gt; wondering if i was <br/>
&gt; &gt; wasting my time in playing him, as my main and all<br/>
&gt; &gt; my alts are <br/>
&gt; &gt; currently on Rodcet Nife.<br/>
