<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-384446774">I have been playing EQ casually for over 2 years.<br/>
I spent the first year and a half trying to find<br/>
the right character for me. finally, I decided to<br/>
consolidate all of the items my characters had on to one<br/>
character per server. Am I to feel guilty about pooling all<br/>
of the plat and items I have earned in my limited<br/>
playing time, so that my chosen characters can play a<br/>
little easier? Would my example be an<br/>
exception?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I say if you have the means and the desire to twink<br/>
then go with it. I would much rather deal with a twink<br/>
over a noobie beggar any day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;just my<br/>
2cp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roby lvl 16 (semi twinked) Monk on Brell&lt;br&gt;Brannon<br/>
lvl 15 (naked poor and rarely played) Shaman on<br/>
Morell Thule.</div>
