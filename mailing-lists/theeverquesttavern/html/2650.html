<div id="ygrps-yiv-664870900">EQ. Having never played an online rpg before I have a few questions ?<br/>
(Forgive my lack of knowledge and feel free to laugh at my questions)<br/>
1. Being used to playing solo games I could pretty much play at my <br/>
own pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other online players but <br/>
seeing as I am a casual gamer i only spend  10-15 hours a week gaming <br/>
is this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play occurs with whoever <br/>
is online at the time and am I not tied into a specific group/times.<br/>
<br/>
2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join with? <br/>
<br/>
3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kharnak, etc) does it <br/>
matter which one I start with or are the later addons geared for <br/>
higher level characters.<br/>
<br/>
4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the system requirements <br/>
but what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866, 128sdram, 32mb ddr nvidia <br/>
geforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or should I wait <br/>
till I upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any feedback</div>
