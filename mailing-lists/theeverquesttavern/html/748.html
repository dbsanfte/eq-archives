server. I dies and couldnt find my body in time. A couple<br/>
people have been really great and have helped me out and<br/>
i was able to get some armour. If anyone else can<br/>
help me out...than would be great...i have little<br/>
money and the armor i have was generously given to me.<br/>
If anyone can help...tha would be great. My name is<br/>
