<div id="ygrps-yiv-80776166">You know, though no one will admit it you are<br/>
exactly right about cute female chars getting free stuff.<br/>
My wife and I both play, we started at the same<br/>
time, but she has so much more stuff than I do, people<br/>
give her things all the time. I have some friends that<br/>
are male but play female chars online. I could never<br/>
understand why they would do that until I saw what you are<br/>
describing, people just give them stuff, lots of stuff, not<br/>
knowing they are really males behind the EQ masks! I<br/>
could never play a female char, it would just be too<br/>
weird, but I understand why others do. I have also seen<br/>
my friends flurting with players even to the point<br/>
of traveling to visit, most of the time coming home<br/>
disappointed. I tried to tell them to get a clue, they dont<br/>
look like they do in the game, but you know what?....<br/>
neither do you!!&lt;br&gt;That is all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanjien&lt;br&gt;19th<br/>
