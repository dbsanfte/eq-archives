<div id="ygrps-yiv-720575928">Anyone ever pay attention to druid agro ability<br/>
in a group?? Everyone talks about clerics and<br/>
wizzies agroing by heals/nukes, but there is a dynamic<br/>
for druids that i haven&#39;t yet figured out. Here are<br/>
some observations, though---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snare/Ensnare<br/>
makes mobs mad, but they are easily taunted from it.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A tank with a druid DS is far less likely to loose<br/>
agro, even by heals/nukes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Druid dots don&#39;t<br/>
seem to cause much hate AT FIRST, and generally don&#39;t<br/>
cause a mob to break agro on a tank and come for you.<br/>
Exception-- get too close and/or start melee. Example-- a mob<br/>
is pulled, everyone bears down on it. I hit it with<br/>
Creeping Crud and Immolate, cast a damage shield, wait a<br/>
bit to make sure someone else has snared and that<br/>
healers are ok, and move it for melee and nuking up<br/>
close. I walk in, take a few wimpy druid hits, and the<br/>
mob totally ignores the Warrior and monk and comes<br/>
for me. I take a few hits for the team and back<br/>
off--mob goes back to hitting the DSd warrior.<br/>
hmmmmm.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fear spells (druids&#39; on work on animals) don&#39;t seem to<br/>
cause much hate-- probably cuz once it finally breaks,<br/>
others have done so much damage that that hate overrides<br/>
it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;healing and nuking are the same for<br/>
druids as clerics/wizzies-- if you hit/heal to hard,<br/>
you&#39;ll pull them off in many cases. I NEVER heal above<br/>
50% health-- i see clerics wasting GrHeal all the<br/>
time-- the secondary tank lost 2 bubs and isn&#39;t getting<br/>
hit anymore, but he gets healed-- or the tank is down<br/>
1 1/2 bubs of life and gets healed with Gr heal.<br/>
Isn&#39;t that a waste??? PLUS--healing a nearly full<br/>
character is more likely to agro the mob on you (if a mob<br/>
has a character down to 40%, it&#39;s less likely to<br/>
leave that guy AT ALL, especially after the recent<br/>
patch affecting this situation--in my experience).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quick way for a lvl 30 druid to die (just like for a<br/>
wizzie)-- start unloading with combust on a freshly pulled<br/>
mob. I&#39;ve seen druids do it, then run around screaming<br/>
&quot;get it off me, get it off me!!!!&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A wizzie<br/>
has to be patient and wait for the right nuking<br/>
opportunity. A druid has so many other options BEFORE he<br/>
starts nuking, that he doesn&#39;t have to get bored--<br/>
snare, DS, DOT....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My 2cp worth-- anyone know of<br/>
a Hate list?? (ie. what actions cause the<br/>
most/worst hate).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
