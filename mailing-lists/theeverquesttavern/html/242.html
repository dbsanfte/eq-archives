<div id="ygrps-yiv-77960859">It&#39;s not all pixies, just Pixie Tricksters, they<br/>
are lighting fires in the forest, and *that&#39;s* why<br/>
you are hunting them.. as a matter of fact, if you<br/>
kill a Pixie Jongelour in Lesser Fay (about 18th level<br/>
or so...) you will *lose* faction with the Jagged<br/>
Pine folks in Surefall Glade, and they are the Druid<br/>
and Ranger guilds in that area, and I believe you<br/>
lose faction with the Druid and Ranger guilds in<br/>
Kelethin, can&#39;t remember though, been a while since I<br/>
killed one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, the &quot;Blue Meanies&quot; are Orc<br/>
Hatchetmen... they are basically Orc Pawns that carry a special<br/>
quest item (a hatchet), they are cutting down trees,<br/>
and that&#39;s why your hunting them, they most commonly<br/>
spawn near the fallen trees near CB...</div>
