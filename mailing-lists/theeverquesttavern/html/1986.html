<div id="ygrps-yiv-782243186">Just cause computers are outdated every 30<br/>
seconds you dont have to run out and buy a new one. Also<br/>
the computer cost more but you get soooo much more<br/>
than a ps2. Also if the ps2 is online there are going<br/>
to be people who make viruses just for the ps2 and<br/>
just the fact that the ps2 can have problems it may<br/>
not be the hard drive but there are tons of things<br/>
that could go wrong. Also computers can have a dvd/cd<br/>
drive all in one. I have one on my computer. Also the<br/>
ps2 is going to be outdated when the x-box and<br/>
gamecube come out.</div>
