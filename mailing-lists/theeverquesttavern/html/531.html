<div id="ygrps-yiv-17066426">I actually had a good day today! I didn&#39;t get a<br/>
lot of exp, but financially I think I was very<br/>
fortunate. I scored a mino axe for 5pp - definite upgrade<br/>
from my rusty longsword! Then, I bought banded tunic<br/>
and boots for 20 pp - big time from my patchwork<br/>
tunic and fur-lined boots! Then, someone offered a<br/>
banded bracer for 6pp - I only had 2 pp left to my name.<br/>
So I got some snake skins - she wanted 40 initially,<br/>
but settled for 24 - and traded that for the bracer!<br/>
Yes! I want to thank Llyr and Joilee - two incredibly<br/>
unselfish people!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Half-elf warrior of 10<br/>
