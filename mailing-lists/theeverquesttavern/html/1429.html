<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039418682">Interesting! Can anyone else confirm that<br/>
hide/sneak is similar to invi/camo? That makes sense to me,<br/>
especially if see invis lets you see hidding/sneaking PCs.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you&#39;re sitting in &quot;hide&quot; mode, i&#39;ve noticed that<br/>
some animals who KOS you will see through the hide.<br/>
(they must be able to smell me!!) This is not true when<br/>
sitting invis/camo, as far as I know. I have not had an<br/>
animal see through my invis - in fact, last night i was<br/>
inches from Grimfeather the griffen, while camo, and he<br/>
/conned indiff and ignored me. I have noticed that<br/>
casters (ie. orc oracles and derv casters) will see<br/>
through my hide, and send their buddies after me. This is<br/>
less true (IME - in my experience) with camo, though<br/>
it happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/con is ALWAYS the rule to be<br/>
sure. Indiff is a good thing, especially when it comes<br/>
to Griffs!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-- i&#39;ll get the /con guide<br/>
and print what it says about levels of green-ness,<br/>
blue-ness, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
