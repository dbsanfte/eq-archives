<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146958238">I&#39;ve never really had a lot of cool stuff to give<br/>
away. But when I gave up my level 16 character to move<br/>
to Drinal... I gave up all of my stuff to a friend<br/>
that had just died and lost all their stuff due to<br/>
falling off the boat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was a BBC, a Silvery<br/>
War Axe 1h, lotsa bronze, a crafted bracer, and about<br/>
150 plat, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve finally settled down on my<br/>
favorite class: Druid. I&#39;m sorta weak b/c I spent too much<br/>
on Str and not enough on Wisdom... but it&#39;s my<br/>
experience that makes me valuable (IMHO).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve also<br/>
got about 20 or 30 characters. I&#39;ve deleted very few<br/>
of them. Although level 30 is by FAR the highest<br/>
I&#39;ve ever gotten. I typically run out on the character<br/>
at around level 5, although I&#39;ve got many above 7<br/>
and three or so above 12, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My point is,<br/>
everyone actually defines twinking differently. I&#39;ve never<br/>
thought of coins as twinking till about 4 months ago. And<br/>
even so, I usually use it to buy spells. Some ppl<br/>
might think a level 12 character in Black Iron armor,<br/>
banded and Bronze is twink. Others have no problem with<br/>
that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helping out others-- and how it relates<br/>
to twinking... I don&#39;t know. I just have troubles<br/>
figuring that out. If someone hands you a set of lambent<br/>
when you&#39;re level 1 as a bard-- do you turn it down?<br/>
It&#39;d just go to someone else if ya did<br/>
so....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
