<div id="ygrps-yiv-710665509">I am really sorry to do this to an organized<br/>
club. But I can&#39;t get the word out. I am starting a new<br/>
EverQuest club. I am urgently looking for members. There<br/>
will be scheduled events regularly. And guides and<br/>
tips. I am also looking for some co-founders. The url<br/>
is &lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/thealtimateeqlounge">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/thealtimateeqlounge</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/thealtimateeqlounge&lt;/a">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/thealtimateeqlounge&lt;/a</a>&gt;<br/>
thank you much for reading. I do not expect many to<br/>
join and do NOT entend on hurting this club, but this<br/>
was my only option, Jammr10</div>
