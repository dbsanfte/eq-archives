<div id="ygrps-yiv-114715762">At level 7 you can go so many places in old world<br/>
that they can&#39;t be listed. It just depends on where<br/>
you are and what you want. Soloing, grouping, seeking<br/>
unique loot, running quests, making plat, getting best<br/>
xp, working on tradeskills in between fighting...<br/>
what is your objective?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For non Iksar, Kunark<br/>
is really for lvl 20ish and up, so no worries yet.<br/>
Be warned though-- Lake of Ill Omen, Frontier<br/>
Mountains, and The Overthere are some of the best zones for<br/>
xp and grouping from 20-35 and beyond. Velius is<br/>
really for 30ish and up, so no worries there either. You<br/>
can survive without Luclin, most of us did until<br/>
recently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone said Mammys in EF for a lvl 24<br/>
and up? Yes-- caveat is that you are a druid or a<br/>
ranger, or team with a druid or ranger. From 25ish-29,<br/>
druids and rangers can solo Mammys for good xp and great<br/>
loot. They have track skill, and generally prefer to<br/>
solo-- because they can. If you&#39;re a pally trying to<br/>
find and beat Mammys alone... good luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many<br/>
dungeons in old world have XP bonuses. If you want XP<br/>
quick-- drag some friends to places like Befallen (i<br/>
think), Najena and Runnyeye. For fast action and group xp<br/>
(if you don&#39;t die too much), get to Crushbone or<br/>
Blackburrow. East Commons is pretty safe, close to town, lots<br/>
of guards and vendors nearby, people at tunnel who<br/>
will buff/heal you, and some orc camps and wandering<br/>
beasts. Bonus if you are working on tailoring--- kill<br/>
spiders, lions and bears. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re a pally-- make<br/>
Unrest your home from about 17ish on up to 30 and beyond<br/>
if you want. Full of undead-- groups in mid to high<br/>
teens start outside the house or in the courtyard, then<br/>
head in to the front door, the side door or the &quot;Round<br/>
Room.&quot; Then upstairs, and finally to the<br/>
basement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Theoretically, you could stay on Faydwer to lvl 40 by doing CB<br/>
and Butcherblock (the dwarf bandits and higher level<br/>
orcs at the shrine), Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron (gobbie camp<br/>
close to Unrest), Unrest, and Mistmoore. Oh, and don&#39;t<br/>
forget about Steamfont-- very overlooked, but there are<br/>
some good hunting spaces, including the dragon<br/>
skeleton area (skellys), Windmill area, outside the Mino<br/>
caves, and inside the Mino caves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve heard you<br/>
can get from 1-30 without leaving Paineel newbie<br/>
zone, Warrents and Stonebrunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT-- how boring<br/>
would that be??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck, and make sure to drag<br/>
some adventurers to some underpopulated zones for some<br/>
fun!!!</div>
