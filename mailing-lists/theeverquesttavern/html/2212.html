<div id="ygrps-yiv-363013110">I know some guys who play females, but I also<br/>
know one who said he couldn&#39;t play a female since he<br/>
thought he would rape himself . . . and then one of my RL<br/>
female friends plays a male iksar, since the &quot;females<br/>
look funky.&quot; i personally have tried to play a male<br/>
character, but it was just too weird for me, so i stick to<br/>
females. but i AM female, so, heh . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanissa<br/>
