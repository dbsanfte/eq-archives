<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-352041268">Attention all RPG&#39;ers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just wanted to<br/>
plug a new Play by E-mail RPG that has started up. I<br/>
really like It and I think any serious RPG&#39;er should<br/>
check it out. Here&#39;s the info that the GM sent me,<br/>
enjoy;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drakkonfira Games in conjunction with Krystol ERPG has begun<br/>
yet another gaming experiance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new<br/>
venture, which remains untitled as of late has begun<br/>
accepting player applications. Please spread the word, but<br/>
encourage others to respond before we fill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This<br/>
project spans all technological eras, a metal and magic<br/>
kind of feel. It encompasses nearly 200 character<br/>
classes and 100 races, each with unique abilities.<br/>
Players will create a character or characters to submerge<br/>
in. Firearms, magic, robotics and psionics are a few<br/>
of the tools you can use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The criteria for<br/>
this ERPG are as follows, but can be discussed, all<br/>
that is really required is desire;&lt;br&gt;1. Knowledge of<br/>
how an ERPG works&lt;br&gt;2. Commitment - 1-2 posts a<br/>
week&lt;br&gt;3. Creativity&lt;br&gt;4. Some RPG tabletop or Wargame<br/>
experiance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To begin, e-mail our head gamemaster, Sachem, with<br/>
your name, E-mail and a breif summary of your<br/>
experiance level. Also, include the type of character you<br/>
would like to play;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-An assasin with senses as<br/>
sharp as his sense of honor.&lt;br&gt;-An engineer who builds<br/>
starships for a tyrannical king.&lt;br&gt;-A lone psionic who is<br/>
battling his own demons as well as those sent by his<br/>
enemies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you and happy gaming,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sachem@...">Sachem@...</a></div>
