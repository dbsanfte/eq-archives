<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525677933">I haven&#39;t played a bard, I haven&#39;t had lambent,<br/>
but if it was me? I&#39;d let someone else take that<br/>
twink and I&#39;d proudly run away from orc pawns in my<br/>
tattered/patchwork armor!!! haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks everyone for<br/>
responding to my issue. I&#39;m most happy that there is a<br/>
mostly con view to abusive twinking (and, in some cases,<br/>
twinking in general). You don&#39;t find that angle on many of<br/>
the boards, as many players (especially on older<br/>
servers) are trying to figure out how to best twink their<br/>
alts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m most happy that you all agree that I<br/>
got SCEWED when that twinking lvl 50+ char took out<br/>
Dylln Starshine to complete the Testament of Vanear for<br/>
his lvl 5 druid, when I have been camping for Dylln<br/>
for 2 weeks!!!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would love to see an<br/>
experimental &quot;non-twink server,&quot; that had lvl limitations on<br/>
weapons, armor and items (Like I said, you can&#39;t &quot;spell<br/>
twink&quot; you casters by using lvl 20 spells at level 1).<br/>
This would probably be the server that you&#39;d find most<br/>
roll players at-- it&#39;s my experience that true roll<br/>
players love the fact that they can finish a quest or<br/>
group well to defeat a tough enemy, while using<br/>
equipment that others may scoff at but that they worked<br/>
hard to get. They love it more when they see that<br/>
lambent covered druid fleeing from an orc pawn-- so do I.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My final word on this -- and then we&#39;ll start a new<br/>
post topic??? -- THINK BEFORE YOU TWINK, and TWINK<br/>
RESPONSIBLY. (I won&#39;t preach and say FRIENDS DON&#39;T LET FRIENDS<br/>
TWINK AND DRIVE). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the<br/>
