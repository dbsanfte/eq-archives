<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990392748">Probably not. For me, the difference between<br/>
those 5 levels was that at 5 I was hard-pressed to kill<br/>
a zombie, and at level 10 I could smoke a dread<br/>
corpse pretty easily. Level 5 to 10 shouldn&#39;t be too<br/>
hard, get your friend to about 10 or so and he/she<br/>
could get exp with you.</div>
