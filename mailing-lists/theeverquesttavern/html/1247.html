<div id="ygrps-yiv-850073751">I need your help to get a message out to the<br/>
Everquest community,&lt;br&gt;and try to see that Verant gets a<br/>
message that they are acting in a very unfair way to<br/>
their players with their new non-moving policy.<br/>
I&lt;br&gt;have characters I have worked on since day one that EQ<br/>
came out, &lt;br&gt;during a scheduled mover split I moved<br/>
them with my guild to another server, then due to Real<br/>
Life I was away from the game for about 10 weeks, when<br/>
I returned I found my guild had disbanded and most<br/>
of my friends no longer were on the server. There<br/>
was a policy that if you moved during a server split<br/>
and didnt like it you could move back within a small<br/>
time frame. Now they say there is a new policy of non<br/>
moving unless it is during a server split, so I am stuck<br/>
on this server, and if I wish to play on a different<br/>
server I need to make new characters that my others<br/>
cannot be moved. I built those characters for almost 18<br/>
months of my life, I put blood sweat tears and love into<br/>
them, yet I do not wish to play them on the TT server,<br/>
I want to play eq with my friends on Karana. I know<br/>
I am not the only person in this kind of situation,<br/>
it s so unfair to have our characters languishing on<br/>
a server we dont play on, to have to start all over<br/>
from scratch and just leave our beloved characters<br/>
rotting where we wont play them! Why should everyone<br/>
&#39;have to be&#39; punished by this non moving policy because<br/>
afew people are doing illegal things like selling<br/>
accounts on Ebay?? People have to register their accounts,<br/>
so why not have a non moving policy for non<br/>
registered people and only punish the poeple who deserve to<br/>
be punished for doing the illegal activites to begin<br/>
with? Or if that isnt a solution find one that only<br/>
punishes the people who are doing these illegal activites<br/>
and not everyone else as well! This policy does not<br/>
stop illegal activites all it does is punish people<br/>
who have done nothing illegal!&lt;br&gt;If you agree please<br/>
email <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jsmedley@...">jsmedley@...</a> or call Verant and let them<br/>
know! Help me to get this totally unfair policy<br/>
changed!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Chantria</div>
