<div id="ygrps-yiv-137634781">Hee hee...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hate to break it to ya, but the<br/>
places where you can begin to earn thousands, even<br/>
hundreds of plat are well out of your level range. Keep<br/>
plodding along with the gear you&#39;ve got.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or, you<br/>
could spend all day, every day in EC, learning the<br/>
prices and getting an idea of what everything is worth.<br/>
I know more than one person who&#39;s made thousands of<br/>
plat before level 20 just by making damned good deals<br/>
in EC. You just have to know what you&#39;re buying and<br/>
selling, what it&#39;s worth, and what you can pay for<br/>
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral Stormfang&lt;br&gt;Retired Ranger&lt;br&gt;Lanys T`Vyl</div>
