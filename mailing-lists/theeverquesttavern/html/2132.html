<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145158107">Peeps = a slang term for people.&lt;br&gt;Twinking =<br/>
when a higher level character gives a lower level<br/>
character stuff that they would not be albe to get<br/>
themselves.&lt;br&gt;Any non pvp server is good to start on. You just have<br/>
to make some friends.&lt;br&gt;On each server your allowed<br/>
up to 8 characters. You can also play on as many<br/>
servers as you want.&lt;br&gt;The cat people will be out in<br/>
december not sure the exact date but I know its in<br/>
december. And they will be albe to be bards, warriors,<br/>
shaman, beastmasters. Not sure what else<br/>
though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien&lt;br&gt;52 Chanter&lt;br&gt;Bertox</div>
