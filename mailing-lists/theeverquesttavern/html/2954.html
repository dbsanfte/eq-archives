=) I&#39;m planning on starting at the same time as my younger brother <br/>
(bloody fool will be starting his own job soon and pay his own game) <br/>
and we&#39;ll be grouping whenever we get off work. Possibly Monk/Shaman <br/>
tandem or Monk/Warrior.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t decided which server yet though. I was on Povar before I <br/>
cancelled my account. Has there been any new servers in the past 2 <br/>
years? Heh. I&#39;ll probably do some research and pick one of the <br/>
younger, less played servers (if there are any).<br/>
