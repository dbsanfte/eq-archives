<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488574621">Couldn&#39;t agree with you more. And you are not<br/>
ranting, just stating the obvious. If you don&#39;t like<br/>
grouping, why do you play an interactive game like EQ? Why<br/>
bother getting on-line with others if all you wanna do<br/>
is solo? &lt;br&gt;Wish you were on Tholuxe Paells so you<br/>
could group with my 26 rogue. *sighs*</div>
