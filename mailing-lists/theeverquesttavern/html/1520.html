<b>Subject:</b> Re: TWINKING-- a discussion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-288133125">::Nukai cracks his knuckles to tackle a topic he<br/>
has tackled before::&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the beginning, there<br/>
was loot. &lt;br&gt;And it was good.&lt;br&gt;Then there was phat<br/>
lewt twinkies.&lt;br&gt;And it pissed me the hell<br/>
off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I share feelings with you about the level 50 guy<br/>
twinking his level 5 druid. I also find the tale of the<br/>
level 1 lambent-covered bard quite humorous. Now I will<br/>
begin with my spiel on it all.&lt;br&gt;I confess. I have<br/>
twinked my characters, as well as donated some to my<br/>
brother&#39;s character. Note: My bro really did lose his<br/>
stuff, all of it. He was level 16 when I helped him out<br/>
with a FS longsword and a fair amount of banded mail.<br/>
Since then I have assisted him in getting his Ivy tunic<br/>
(cause I got some braided Ivy cords out of the deal!)<br/>
And he promptly returned my mail to me. So this is<br/>
more of a loan. My characters on the other hand are<br/>
more a model for a certain kind of item or armor. Such<br/>
as I created a wizard so I could see someone wear my<br/>
flowing black robe and water crystal staff, he&#39;s level 2<br/>
but I like him. I have a shaman level 4 with totemic<br/>
gauntlets (never try to do totemic quests for money, you<br/>
get stuck with the item) and a harpoon of the depths<br/>
(a trade for a pair of gem inlaid gauntlets). My<br/>
warrior troll I have played straight up to level 9, and<br/>
only now am I beginning to buy him some armor, but<br/>
this is a style matter. I am hooking him up with<br/>
red-dyed fine plate, I hope it looks good. He gathered the<br/>
fungus for the dyes, I am only assisting in the<br/>
financial department.&lt;br&gt;You will always be pissed at<br/>
someone lower level than you with better stuff. I was, in<br/>
fact I still am. Every time I see a druid lower (I&#39;m<br/>
talking level 5 or 6 here even) than me with runed<br/>
mithril bracers, I want to reach out and smack them. But<br/>
I get over it, the reason they are twinked is<br/>
because they have a higher up that went through all the<br/>
rights of passage (unless they had a friend power level<br/>
a druid to 34 and raised the cash through<br/>
teleports). Don&#39;t hate them because they are twinkies, hate<br/>
them for being bastards (such as the camp-stealing lvl<br/>
50, mentioned earlier). &lt;br&gt;There are good twinks out<br/>
there, but it all depends on the player. I have grouped<br/>
before with both rising primaries and decked-out twinks.<br/>
As long as they know what they are doing, I am okay<br/>
with things. I just don&#39;t want to hear &quot;Train to zone!<br/>
Werebat is after me!&quot; from a level 4 paladin wearing some<br/>
kickass armor wielding a ghoulbane. (For those of you<br/>
unfamiliar with Unrest, a werebat is still blue to a 35<br/>
druid, something a real level 4 pally would never go<br/>
near).&lt;br&gt;Anyways, don&#39;t hate me because I twink up some of my<br/>
people.&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf</div>
