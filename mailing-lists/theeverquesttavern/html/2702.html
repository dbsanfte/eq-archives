<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834025690">I had the same issue. And looking at EQ&#39;s support page will not tell <br/>
you the correct fix for it. They claim that you should download a new <br/>
EverQuest.exe file and run it. This will not fix the issue. If you <br/>
read further on the page, they briefly talk about the patcher not <br/>
working correctly if Internet Explorer is not installed on your pc. <br/>
They FAIL to mention that you need to be running IE 5.5 or better for <br/>
it to work at all. I was running 5.0 and it would not connect to the <br/>
patcher. I downloaded and installed 5.5, rebooted, and WHAM! I&#39;m <br/>
online.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you,<br/>
