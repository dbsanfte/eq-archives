Hey, ya really want to go wild?  How about starting a guild on that<br/>
server with people from the list (and you could even add friends of<br/>
people on this list to the guild as well)?   Even a step farther, if you<br/>
wanted to, you could start a new Yahoo! Group with people from this<br/>
group that decide to play on that server on it... :-)  That way, you<br/>
could keep in touch with in game happenings, etc.  I am game :-)  If<br/>
anyone is interested in doing that, send me an email, and I can try and<br/>
set it up (the new Yahoo! Group) and we can take this chat into there<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>

HMMMMMMMMMM................ maybe we can all make a new char and pick<br/>
one<br/>
particular server for everone to meet at and group with. I think that<br/>
would<br/>
be really neat. We could meet one day a week on these characters, that<br/>
way<br/>
we can play our others too. I know some of you already have 5<br/>
characters.<br/>
But you can delete to make a new character. I have done that to move to<br/>
different server. Now i only have 2 charcaters, so ie easy for me to go<br/>
to<br/>
different server to make a new character. I thought this would be a neat<br/>
idea, kinda like a club thing.... Well, let me know you guys what you<br/>
think<br/>
and we can decide if we would like to try this.      Surreal <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmi would say first to go to www.eqdruids.com if you dont already <br/>
know about it. It is a terrific druid only site. In the messages <br/>
boards they have sticky post about where to hunt at your general lvl. <br/>
Not for sure but at 41 i think i was quadding snow cougers in ice <br/>
clad or maybe the specs in oasis. After them i went to timoruos deep <br/>
and started quadding spirocs. That took me to all the way to 51 xp <br/>
slows down at about 50 51 on the spirocs but i know can take you to <br/>
52 as i am about to ding it there. Or you can start trying the <br/>
raptors in that same zone also. I havent tried them yet but read that <br/>
it can be done. If you want to make some money and xp head to cobalt <br/>
scar and quad the wyverns. Save the pelts and sell them in bazaar and <br/>
sell the gems to vendors for about 40plat. This is a bit more <br/>
dangerous and harder as there is always people there farming. Unless <br/>
you have killed alot of giants in velious and raised your claws of <br/>
veeshan <br/>
faction you will be kos to the drakes there and they cast on you for <br/>
like 300 dam. Do not pull the named wyvern he cannot be slowed or <br/>
snared. As far as the wis items i just went to bazaar and filled in <br/>
the filters one of them you can pick wis and all wis items will come <br/>
up then just shop away. It will be slow quadding till you get your <br/>
new aoe spell lightnig blast and lvl 45 when you can get kei then its <br/>
smooth sailing to 51. Oh there is a good quest wis book you can hold <br/>
in your off hand adss like 10 wis and somethin other would be easy to <br/>
obtain at you lvl. Sorry but i forgot the name of it next time im on <br/>
ill check but can prolly find it on the druid site. <br/>
