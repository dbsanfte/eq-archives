<b>Subject:</b> Is it just me or has EQ gotten boring? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876013867">When I first started playing EQ I played<br/>
hardcore. I made some friends and I played with them almost<br/>
24/7. I have started and deleted a character from just<br/>
about every class there is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now, most of my old<br/>
friends are gone. The ones that still play have leveled<br/>
there characters to far for me to play with them<br/>
anymore. I still love playing, but I seem to find that it<br/>
is not as much fun as before. I currently have 5<br/>
characters, the highest being a level 24 druid. My friend,<br/>
who started his druid after I did mine, is now at<br/>
level 48. Granted I was away from EQ for a 3 months<br/>
period, where my friend was playing to beat the band.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; My friend has been playing longer than I have. He<br/>
has a nack for knowing what mobs to kill to get the<br/>
best XP vs LOOT ratio. I on the other hand have been<br/>
at level 24 ten times now. I have a nack for dieing<br/>
and losing my level again and again. It is very<br/>
frustrating to watch someone level so fast, while you get<br/>
stuck behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I find myself not playing EQ<br/>
quite as much as I once did. Is there anyone else here<br/>
who has had similar problems? If so, were you able to<br/>
make it fun again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks for letting me vent.<br/>
