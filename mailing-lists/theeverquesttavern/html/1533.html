<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-860697216">Well, I&#39;m not gonna say a word about twinking<br/>
anymore. Got called a &quot;dumb newbie&quot; over on Everlore&#39;s<br/>
Rogue discussion board for voicing my opinions on the<br/>
subject. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, no more, except for this one last<br/>
thing (!). It is a matter of roleplaying, I think<br/>
(don&#39;t worry, shooman, I still like you and like reading<br/>
your posts). Dang, it&#39;s really hard to verbalize this<br/>
. . . OK, I have a Dwarf Paladin, 2nd level, who&#39;s<br/>
currently camped next to the guards in Butcherblock. My<br/>
Dwarf Rogue, meanwhile (main character, now 11th level)<br/>
came across a bitchin&#39; Fine Steel Great Staff. He<br/>
can&#39;t use it, and it would be very easy to drop it for<br/>
the Paladin and a very cool item for her. But I don&#39;t<br/>
want to do that, because there&#39;s no &quot;logical&quot; reason<br/>
for her to find it, in the context of the game. It<br/>
would be contrived, and that would take away from the<br/>
purity (integrity?) of my Paladin . . . Actually, I<br/>
_could_ rationalize it -- I actually think of them as<br/>
brother and sister . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for every item that<br/>
my Rogue has, there&#39;s a story behind it that I<br/>
remember, even those items given to me by others (which<br/>
they call &quot;handouts,&quot; not &quot;twinking,&quot; on Everlore).<br/>
Like the Gnome who gave me the Tailored Whip and said,<br/>
&quot;Go kill something with it, I want to see it in<br/>
action.&quot; Or the fact that I bought my Dwarven Banded Mail<br/>
with the proceeds from selling a Lambent gem that I<br/>
got for guiding a High Elf through<br/>
Butcherblock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suspect this isn&#39;t making sense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But<br/>
maybe that&#39;s it -- roleplayers are perhaps less likely<br/>
to twink, or at least twink in a less grandiose<br/>
fashion. Like the guy (54th level Druid) who&#39;s going to<br/>
buy Ravenscale or Rygorr (sp?) for his new Gnome<br/>
Rogue. Good gosh, I don&#39;t even have any idea what that<br/>
stuff is. Most people don&#39;t roleplay (shooman does, I<br/>
know from these boards), let&#39;s admit it, so it&#39;s a<br/>
case where many folks want to be able to play the game<br/>
more effectively, more quickly. Twinking allows<br/>
that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, OK -- if that&#39;s your gig, go ahead and twink. My<br/>
gig is (role)playing a character, and filling out the<br/>
story of his life. To each his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
Kaladim&lt;br&gt;11th level Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal&lt;br&gt;Who will never speak of<br/>
twinking again . . .</div>
