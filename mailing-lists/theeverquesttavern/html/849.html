<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962467931">Hehe, I kinda changed careers too. Been playing<br/>
Quinon, gnome cleric, as my main character. Ranger lost<br/>
its appeal, but clerics are so much fun! Quinon is<br/>
level 33 now, so he&#39;s slowly getting up there. I don&#39;t<br/>
mind Mithaniel Marr too much. There are some annoying<br/>
uber-guilds, but they usually can&#39;t screw me up too much =)<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll catch you on ICQ and we can chat sometime.<br/>
Good to see ya!</div>
