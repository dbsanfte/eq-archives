<div id="ygrps-yiv-783170181">Well I was lvl 42, i could solo about 2/3 of the<br/>
monsters. (this is including giants) It was pretty hard to<br/>
do. but i would think you would atleast need to be<br/>
lvl 35 in a full group to even have a chance at a<br/>
full suit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor, 43rd Bard on the<br/>
