<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-381193883">Ive looked at buying EQ since it came out but no<br/>
one i know plays it so i dont know what its like. I<br/>
like rpgs, thats not the problem. I just dont want to<br/>
buy a game and be stuck w/ it so im looking into it.<br/>
Is it only an internet game or can you play by<br/>
yourself on your pc. How much is it a month for the<br/>
internet, is it a flat rate or by the hour. Look forward to<br/>
hearing and playing if its all everyone is saying it is.</div>
