<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424055343">Ok, I need some help here. I am a 12 monk on<br/>
Veeshan and there is NO WERE for me to hunt! I have tried<br/>
kerras island, but I die conesitently, and have actually<br/>
LOST XP. I have tried the E and W commons, but cant<br/>
solo there, there is nothing worth killing ANYWAYS,<br/>
besides dervs, and I have tried Black Burrow, but that<br/>
also sucks. What about the chessboard in Butcher<br/>
Block? What do you all think? I am open to ANY<br/>
suggestions...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cerial&lt;br&gt;12TH Monk&lt;br&gt;Veeshan</div>
