<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044908236">I&#39;ve only been playing EQ for about 6 months, but<br/>
putting TONS of hours into it. Now that I have a Mid 40&#39;s<br/>
character, I&#39;ve tried twinking the heck out of some<br/>
characters & I have to admit that it&#39;s pretty funny taking<br/>
out Yellow mobs in 20 seconds or<br/>
less...solo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what I&#39;m really curious to see is the Post-Luclin<br/>
twinking that&#39;s going to be rampant. I think it will be<br/>
like a race to see who can get the first Lvl50 VAH or<br/>
BST out there. We are already seeing equipment<br/>
including these characters in the race/class<br/>
categories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for me you ask? I will definitely be jumping feet<br/>
first into one of the new classes. Undoubtedly there<br/>
will be some class balancing issues to begin with & it<br/>
will be up to me to figure out what the strengths &<br/>
weaknesses are before the good stuff get&#39;s<br/>
nerfed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cya out there</div>
