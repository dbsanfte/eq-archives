<b>Subject:</b> AC & Agility <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-143842055">Okay folks, I just got two I think they were<br/>
serpentine bracers (AC 1 Dex +2?maybe 3, Agility +9) Well my<br/>
ranger has two bracers at the moment with 6ac a piece.<br/>
When I put on my new bracers I loose a lot of AC. I<br/>
want to know since agility means less hits and damage,<br/>
whether or not loosing this AC is a bad thing or will my<br/>
new agility help out more?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kinda confused.<br/>
Tried both ways against the same conned creature and it<br/>
seemed with new bracers i got hit more. Please help<br/>
out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mykeal&lt;br&gt;Ranger of the 17th season in worship of our magnificant<br/>
