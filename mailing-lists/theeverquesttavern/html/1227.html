<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616972110">1) Gotcha. I actually got it to work. Set it at<br/>
2. It&#39;s pretty cool although I haven&#39;t experimented<br/>
much with it. I was too busy hunting for spiderlings<br/>
and discovering that I should NEVER beg from<br/>
merchants. LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Ppl have told me begging from<br/>
merchants was a bad idea. I found out why. LOL. Merchants<br/>
double attack (or maybe that was dual wield) and hit a<br/>
level 8 character for 48 a pop. Haven&#39;t gotten a raise<br/>
in beg skill in so long, I feel pathetic.<br/>
=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Thanks Iskandar for the info about skills. I<br/>
found the Kelethin Racial forge (don&#39;t ask me to spell<br/>
that... lol) yesterday. Makes me wish I had 100 plat to<br/>
get smithing up that high. =) Oh well, heck... I&#39;m<br/>
only level 9. I&#39;m glad the things I&#39;m reading on<br/>
Fletching are wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also means I can feel free<br/>
to fish all day long. Cooking a stack of fish with<br/>
wasp wings and bat wings is TOUGH to gain skill. I<br/>
have no idea why. I only get a point or two per stack<br/>
of 20. Almost tempted to sell<br/>
instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
