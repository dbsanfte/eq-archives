<div id="ygrps-yiv-890002690">1) You lose exp at level 5. However, it&#39;s at the<br/>
most nominal AND you cannot drop below level 5. Level<br/>
6 is just when it starts to hurt to lose exp b/c<br/>
... well, you can drop to level 5. (They&#39;ve changed a<br/>
lot but I know that was the case at least a year ago.<br/>
Haven&#39;t tried it recently. But I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not<br/>
something that changed.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Cool. Since I&#39;ve never<br/>
known anyone that has lost two levels, I could not<br/>
confirm if the skills autoraised to the level last<br/>
obtained once levels were recovered. Couldn&#39;t find any<br/>
info on that any where.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) When&#39;d they patch in<br/>
the &quot;cannot buff the npc&quot; stuff? Heh... I&#39;ve never<br/>
tried it but used to have people that would buff mobs<br/>
while they were attacking a player just to get revenge.<br/>
Used to work. Glad they fixed that. Fighting an Orc<br/>
with Chloro, Skin Like Nature, and a DS<br/>
stinks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also just recently found out I can heal Skellie<br/>
Pets again. For a while, I couldn&#39;t do that. Not sure<br/>
why. I hadn&#39;t tried in a while-- then one day... was<br/>
targetting enchanter pet-- and mistargetted. But the Skell<br/>
pet healed. =) Managed to heal both up. I like<br/>
healing pets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Yes, I corrected myself about the<br/>
animal faction. I am almost certain that it used to be<br/>
the case. I had a druid on Veeshan (about sheesh, 2<br/>
years ago by now?) that was always being attacked by<br/>
the stupid kodiaks when sitting down. He was level 14<br/>
and killed a lot of kodiaks when in groups. Haven&#39;t<br/>
played him in at least a year--was on Veeshan as a<br/>
warrior for about 4 months and then 7 months as my druid<br/>
on Drinal. Wonder if -- since factions with animals<br/>
no longer are evident (have had at least 3 friends<br/>
confirm this)-- if I can finally sit with bears on<br/>
veeshan. I&#39;ll let people know if I ever get on as my druid<br/>
in Veeshan again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>
