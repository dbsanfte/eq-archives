technical belligerent please turn away. ;)<br/>
<br/>
You might be able to have that high of a connection between your <br/>
modem and your computer, but that&#39;s not possible going out to the <br/>
internet (where you&#39;ll connect with Verant&#39;s servers). You <br/>
can &quot;trick&quot; the computer into thinking you&#39;re running anything over <br/>
56K (your speed of 115+ for example) by configuring your PC to <br/>
display a higher speed but you are running 56K max regardless because <br/>
that is all a regular phone line can handle. Unless of course you <br/>
have ISDN. You can also make adjustments to your modem (tweak, like <br/>
you said) to make it run slightly &quot;faster&quot;, BUT in no way can it be <br/>
cranked up to double its speed. The reason it appears faster is <br/>
because normally you do not get that full 56K when you use dial-up. <br/>
By &quot;tweaking&quot; the modem, you are now getting that near 56K. <br/>
<br/>
You know, websites galore advertise these things constantly saying <br/>
you can do all of these neat tricks to fool your modem into faster <br/>
speeds. That&#39;s the half truth. Yes, they might help you configure <br/>
your modem for maximum potential (therefore, faster speed), but going <br/>
beyond what it&#39;s capable of... nah, I have yet to see it happen.<br/>
