<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195208364">Greetings, I hope this answers a few of your<br/>
questions...&lt;br&gt;1. Wood Elf Ranger - my personal favorite. I have a<br/>
lvl 42 wood elven ranger on the Mith Marr server.<br/>
Rangers a very fun and complicated class to play, as well<br/>
as versatile. As a melee class, it is our duty to<br/>
protect the weak spellcasters in our group from harm.<br/>
However, we do not get all the convenient teleport spells<br/>
pure spellcasters get.&lt;br&gt;2. Erudite Wizard - Wizards<br/>
are the masters of dealing the most damage in the<br/>
shortest amount of time. They also have great travel<br/>
spells like druids. Just a warning: if you are going to<br/>
play a wizard, be prepared to die a lot and spend a<br/>
LOT of time meditating. Additionally, Erudites have<br/>
horrible night vision.&lt;br&gt;3. Halfling rogue - Don&#39;t know<br/>
much about this class/race combo but I see a lot of<br/>
them around. The halfling rogues i group with seem to<br/>
enjoy playing their character.&lt;br&gt;4. High Elf druid -<br/>
High elves cannot be druids...perhaps you meant Half<br/>
Elves? Statistically, half elves make the worst druids<br/>
(lowest wisdom score), but what the heck...it&#39;s a game,<br/>
have fun =)&lt;br&gt;5. Dark Elf Necro - Necromancers are<br/>
extremely powerful - they can heal themselves, cast<br/>
powerful Dot (damage over time) spells, summon a skeleton<br/>
to fight for them, and do many other things. The<br/>
downside is that nobody outside of their own city and the<br/>
Ogre and Troll cities likes &#39;em. &lt;br&gt;dark<br/>
