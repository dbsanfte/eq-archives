<div id="ygrps-yiv-272703446">1) Sorry I&#39;ve been so silent lately. Life&#39;s been<br/>
so busy. Made level 32 though. Woot. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) On<br/>
trains. Yes-- attempt to shout about trains. Also, I<br/>
always ask if they need help unless it really looks like<br/>
they&#39;re about to bite it. A couple of times, I&#39;ve taunted<br/>
it off them-- then let it hit me and they finish it<br/>
off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is especially hard to do b/c I&#39;m a druid. So I<br/>
tend to heal more often. Which in and of itself is a<br/>
GREAT taunt. ;) Dang I love my character but sometimes<br/>
I forget and reflex hit buttons. And the tanks are<br/>
all yelling for me to stop casting spells. LOL. When<br/>
I reply that I&#39;ll I&#39;m doing is attacking, had cast<br/>
one spell, and hit the beg button-- they are usually<br/>
surprised. (as a druid, I can hit 5 buttons and probably not<br/>
even three melee&#39;s taunting, and an enchanter and a<br/>
wizard could taunt it off me. I know. It&#39;s happened.<br/>
Course I was trying to taunt at the time. But dang it<br/>
got close. Almost died.).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Sorry... verbose<br/>
as always. And online relationships are fun. I&#39;ve<br/>
never had anyone that I&#39;ve met though. And the weird<br/>
thing is... I&#39;ve grouped with SOOOO many characters<br/>
that I feel bad. The reason is, I&#39;ll have people say<br/>
-- &quot;hey! Good to see you again.&quot; And I have to blink<br/>
in a stupor trying to dredge up the my dull attled<br/>
brain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhoo... so it&#39;s interesting how complex and ambiguous<br/>
this new Internet media has taken Social Interactions.<br/>
You have the opportunity to meet thousands of people<br/>
all over the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) On Clerics. Great<br/>
people. Enchanters, Bards, and Clerics. Enchanters are<br/>
obvious brute power when combined with a group. Bards are<br/>
augmentors of everyone in a group. Clerics on the other hand<br/>
are subtle. A Cleric in a group can make killing so<br/>
much easier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EI-- your tanks can tank a LOT<br/>
stronger mobs without worrying about it as much. EI... At<br/>
level 18, if I had a cleric, and a tank... we could<br/>
take out Avocets. Two Melees and me-- splat. We&#39;d be<br/>
dead. Clerics rock. I hope I haven&#39;t been too unclear<br/>
lately. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Think that&#39;s it... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic of the Drinal Division.&lt;br&gt;Master<br/>
Drinker, Master Beggar, Master Brewer, Master Fisher,<br/>
Master Forager, umm... Etc.&lt;br&gt;(Still can&#39;t believe I<br/>
haven&#39;t mastered smithing yet. Sigh. Sooooo little time.<br/>
And sigh. I know. A bit excessive ending, but I<br/>
couldn&#39;t resist. I&#39;m proud of all the things I&#39;ve<br/>
mastered. Getting so close to Baking, Fletching, and<br/>
Smithing masters.)</div>
