<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119569470">When you first start up the game, you will see a<br/>
list of servers that you can play on, and you choose<br/>
which one you want your character to be on There all<br/>
exactly the same game, but your character would not be<br/>
able to move from server to server, its just to keep<br/>
things from getting too crowded. Actually theres a<br/>
couple of player vs player servers so those are a bit<br/>
different. other than that, the main difference is how many<br/>
people play on each one, some are busier than<br/>
others&lt;br&gt;Kind of like another game room like you said : )</div>
