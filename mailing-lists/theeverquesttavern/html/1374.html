<div id="ygrps-yiv-231846841">What the prev two have said is correct. However,<br/>
b/c it (Intelligence) does affect how fast you gain<br/>
in SKILLS-- it is important. A bonus when you&#39;re<br/>
thinking, man, why doesn&#39;t my backstab or my dodge go up<br/>
faster. Or man, I drink one drink and I&#39;m drunker than a<br/>
pig in a poka dot dress. (Don&#39;t ask.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Int is<br/>
important but also-- time you play battling exp mobs raises<br/>
your skills anyway. So it&#39;s a tough call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also,<br/>
I don&#39;t know if they mentioned it, hybrid classes<br/>
used to drain exp from a group-- now it balances out<br/>
to almost be a gain (but not really-- almost extra<br/>
exp though).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also that Warriors take less exp<br/>
to level than other classes. They&#39;re designed to die<br/>
a lot and deal damage-- tanks and more. So that&#39;s<br/>
why they get an exp benefit-- the first to die in a<br/>
battle gone wrong is often the Warrior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now not<br/>
all Warriors feel like that, but when I used to play<br/>
a Warrior (gave all my stuff away on the Veeshan<br/>
server -- was only level 16 anyway)... I tried my best<br/>
to imitate that... but it&#39;s hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On thing<br/>
that I used to do was the mantra... &quot;I am tank-- if I<br/>
yell run... run for zone... no questions<br/>
asked.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS man I go on and on... apologies<br/>
ppl. =)</div>
