<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343818039">And there&#39;s no real competition though for Monk.<br/>
Has to be Iskar monk. Despite the locational<br/>
drawback, the regen alone makes Iskar more worth while.<br/>
Having forage at char gen helps too in terms of -- money<br/>
issues are always a concern with monks. They can&#39;t carry<br/>
over 14 stones (unless you&#39;re a high level and then I<br/>
think max is what-- 20 stones at 60?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When<br/>
most people make a new char they really dont care<br/>
about money cause there just going to twink the hell<br/>
out of the char anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the iksar regan is<br/>
like 2 or 3 more hp per tick then a human monk. Thats<br/>
not that much of a big deal. Iksar monks are not the<br/>
best. And for the human night sight lil thing called a<br/>
glowing stone band it has perm serp sight. And all monks<br/>
cant carry over 14 stones before level<br/>
16.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien</div>
