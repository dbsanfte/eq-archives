<b>Subject:</b> Death and Carnage in Lower Guk! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065163730">I have now begun my trips into Lower Guk, I have<br/>
the full belief that this is one of the most deadly<br/>
areas in the game. Not only are there the undead goul<br/>
frogs... but live ones as well! So if you ruined your<br/>
faction with them, things will be alot harder. The first<br/>
few things just at the dead side entrance to guk are<br/>
live frogs... just 3 but after that its all ghouls.<br/>
these frogs vary from about lvl 30 to 34, as you go<br/>
deeper in you run accross bats and spiders (wich will<br/>
attack) so you cannot just get through with invis undead.<br/>
The place i have been currently camping with a guild<br/>
i am in, &quot;The Aggressors&quot; in the tower. In the<br/>
Assasin room to be exact. So far i have aquired no<br/>
treasure so far there, other than lots of pp. I have lost<br/>
lotto after lotto on the Guise of the Deciever :( This<br/>
is the mask that turns you into a dark elf!!! I will<br/>
keep the site posted on these short little trips.<br/>
Meanwhile have fun in Norrath!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor, 36th<br/>
