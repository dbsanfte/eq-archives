<div id="ygrps-yiv-620184680">Steamfont Mountains. This place is prime hunting<br/>
ground for a pair of adventurers. Lots of Lesser Ebon<br/>
Drakes and Rogue Clockwork Spiders and Harpys and<br/>
Minotaur Slavers. Not to mention the good supply of<br/>
elementals(Steam, Earth, etc.) &lt;br&gt; I hardly find more than 20<br/>
people in this zone at one time. i&#39;m on the XEV server.<br/>
i can&#39;t say how it fares for other servers seeing<br/>
as how i don&#39;t play on them, but i think it should<br/>
be the same throughout. &lt;br&gt; i leveled up from 11 to<br/>
12 in a matter of about 25 minutes. i was very<br/>
excited. of course i had a friend buff me with Skin like<br/>
Nature so i was to the advantage of other lvl 11<br/>
characters. &lt;br&gt; I play as a warrior and i had a warrior<br/>
partner. i wish i had a spell caster partner instead. i<br/>
found that i could do no damage to those steam<br/>
elementals. (FYI- Elementals will join in a fight if one is<br/>
fighting. They flock to the scene like no bodies business.)<br/>
So i tried to avoid the elementals. &lt;br&gt;<br/>
Furthermore, i have to state that Steamfont has now become my<br/>
favorite hunting ground. I used to like Crushbone,(i like<br/>
to call it Campbone.) but seeing as how it&#39;s always<br/>
being camped i can not go there anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; just<br/>
my two coppers worth.</div>
