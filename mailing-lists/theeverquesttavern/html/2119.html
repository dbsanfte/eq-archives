<div id="ygrps-yiv-486782475">Just a quick update on a couple of<br/>
things:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Small Scarab Breastplate is +1 STR, STA; -1 Dex,<br/>
+10 HP, +2 vs. Disease. (You are a Halfling,<br/>
right?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gnoll Lariat is 3/20, but with AC of 3, and stun.<br/>
That&#39;s a nice thing -- you stun something while soloing,<br/>
you could actually swing around and do a backstab,<br/>
with good timing. Can&#39;t tell when it procs, however;<br/>
probably around 25 or so. Dropped by Tesch Mas Gnolls and<br/>
Gnoll Commanders in Split Paw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Dragoon Dirk<br/>
is another nice weapon for a Rogue (6/23, +2 Dex, +3<br/>
vs. Magic, fits in Range slot (just don&#39;t throw it!).<br/>
Drops off of Ambassador D&#39;Vinn in Crushbone, who&#39;s a<br/>
nasty SoB. There will probably be very intense<br/>
competition for this weapon, if there isn&#39;t<br/>
already.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And heck, if you&#39;re there to kill D&#39;Vinn, may as well<br/>
kill the Emperor himself for the Dwarven Ringmail<br/>
Tunic (AC12, +8 vs. Magic, Fire, Cold). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You<br/>
have been to The Safehouse, haven&#39;t you?!<br/>
(www.thesafehouse.org)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go forth and backstab, young Rogue!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
