<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250440683">I have a 26 DE SK, and he is great fun. Only<br/>
problems I can see is for solo work (which I do most of<br/>
the time) he has zero buffs and cant heal so downtime<br/>
is very lengthy. Trolls and Ogres are good in that<br/>
they are very strong but not very smart so dont learn<br/>
skills very fast. I havn&#39;t tried and Iksar so dont have<br/>
much to say about them except that they cant wear the<br/>
really cool SK quest armor so that is a<br/>
bummer.&lt;br&gt;Anyway, good luck and have fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uinan<br/>
