<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-657476746">Hmmm... maybe I&#39;ll try to beat Kharlisht&#39;s post<br/>
length!! haha. To Twink or not to Twink, that is the<br/>
question. Here&#39;s something to ponder... most people who are<br/>
avid RPG players abor twinking when they first start<br/>
this game and are not &quot;rich&quot; enough to do any twinking<br/>
anyway (though there are some who think &quot;WOW-- i can&#39;t<br/>
wait &#39;till i can twink a new char.!!!&quot;). Then comes<br/>
the dillemma-- you now have spen a lot of time in<br/>
Norrath and have at least one char of such a level that<br/>
he/she has a sizable account in the bank and backpacks<br/>
full of items that are great, but you&#39;ll never use.<br/>
What to do??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you any less of a player<br/>
because you twink? I used to think so, but maybe i&#39;m<br/>
changing my mind. Maybe some people just see that as<br/>
another way to have fun with the game, and after all...<br/>
it&#39;s just a game. Personally-- I think my low level<br/>
chars are twinked even though they have cloth armor and<br/>
a bronze dagger. My lower chars are twinked because<br/>
of my knowledge and experience playing this game. I<br/>
know about quests, mobs, zones and fighting strategies<br/>
(though class specific strategies, especially with my new<br/>
chanter, still show my how much of a n00b I really am!!!).<br/>
I know when to flee to avoid certain death, how to<br/>
help my fellow groupmates best, and -hehe- which way<br/>
to turn to send that orc Lego on a path away from me<br/>
so I can make it to the zone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for being<br/>
invincable by twinking-- i think that depends on what class<br/>
you are. Casters can get more mana by twinking, but<br/>
can&#39;t get better spells, so they are limited when it<br/>
comes to taking on Red mobs even if twinked. Also, even<br/>
if you twink caster armor, they still have low HP<br/>
and AC, and are going to get crushed by mobs. Case in<br/>
point-- i grouped with a twinked lvl 10 wizzie in CB, who<br/>
had TONS of mana and kept unloading lvl 8 nukes on<br/>
Legos-- also kept getting agrod and dying because 5 hits<br/>
and she was dead. (which is pretty good, because as<br/>
an un-twinked chanter, 2-3 hits usually kills<br/>
me!!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melee classes seem to be best suited for twinking, at<br/>
least to be sucessful at lower levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last<br/>
point-- acceptable/unacceptable twinking is such a grey<br/>
area. There is an economy in Norrath, and everything<br/>
can be for sale. Low levels can find way to &quot;twink&quot;<br/>
their own money supply, buy selling bone chips/bat<br/>
wings-- starting trades (I know a low teen mage who<br/>
twinked himself after getting to the point of tailoring<br/>
those backpacks), etc. Personally, I play for fun and<br/>
it&#39;s not fun to me if there is not challenge or risk.<br/>
I CAN NOT count how many times my main char has<br/>
died-- if he was twinked from the start, that number<br/>
would probably be 1/2 and i&#39;d be 5 levels higher than I<br/>
am right now at least. But I&#39;ve been killed by some<br/>
of the greatest mobs in Norrath, and am proud of the<br/>
many &quot;Xela&quot; notches in the belts of those mobs-- and<br/>
even more proud of the notches in my belt when I<br/>
return and exact painful revenge!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No<br/>
Farming..... that&#39;s another topic....<br/>
(/grin)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--how&#39;d i do Kharlisht??</div>
