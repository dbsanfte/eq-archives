<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244305101">As far as hunting, I don&#39;t see why you should<br/>
have any problems hunting. Just go to Lake of Ill<br/>
Omens and then shout out level 13 sk lfg (looking for<br/>
group). You shouldn&#39;t have much problem finding a<br/>
group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunting is good in Lake as spawn rates seem swift and<br/>
fast. Haven&#39;t personally killed there much as I went<br/>
the Derv camp, Orcs in Oasis, and Aviaks route. Had<br/>
been doing Tech Mas Gnolls but friends told me to go<br/>
to Lake. Lake doesn&#39;t seem to have much loot but<br/>
dang the exp is goooood and the stream of kills rarely<br/>
pauses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope that helped.&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
