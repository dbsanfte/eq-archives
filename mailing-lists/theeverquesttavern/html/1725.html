<div id="ygrps-yiv-348560024">I must agree about the Warrens. And actually, I<br/>
still found myself there off and on until I hit 35 when<br/>
the Muglwump finally became trivial (but not before I<br/>
got my cast iron stein, mind you). I feel that the<br/>
Warrens, and the upcoming Stonebrunt Mountains are just<br/>
what Odus needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other favorite hunting spots<br/>
include Rathe Mountains (although solo druids do very<br/>
well here, I prefer to group because we can down<br/>
giants so much faster) for cash and a fair amount of<br/>
experience. I remember being in Cazic Thule for a good while,<br/>
giving hell to the lizardmen. The Overthere is pretty<br/>
good for experience from what I hear, but I don&#39;t set<br/>
foot on Kunark much. &lt;br&gt;Crystal Caverns is incredibly<br/>
fun, and so is Dalnir&#39;s Crypt (though this area is<br/>
best for a monk, as about half the item drops are for<br/>
monks).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dalnir&#39;s is off Warslick&#39;s Woods (if I remember right) and<br/>
supports players from about 24 - 35 (maybe a little<br/>
higher). Drops of nifty armor and weapons (most monk only)<br/>
and decent cash. Be sure to have a group though, this<br/>
is not an area for solo hunting.</div>
