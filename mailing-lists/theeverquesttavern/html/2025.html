<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856856202">Actually, don&#39;t bother enchanting. Enchanted<br/>
jewelry only sells better. I&#39;ve never heard of it making<br/>
any difference to leveling up Jewelry skills. Only<br/>
thing that does is a high Int... and some say a high<br/>
Wis. Some say either high int or high wis. Others say<br/>
one or the other with a benefit with a high secondary<br/>
stat. Etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now if you&#39;re enchanting it to make<br/>
it sell better to players. Yes, do that. That&#39;s the<br/>
way to make money off the tradeskill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BEST<br/>
site for trade skills is www.eqtraders.com. The most<br/>
comprehensive trade skill site there is out<br/>
there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic&lt;br&gt;Master Baker, Beggar, Brewer,<br/>
Forager.&lt;br&gt;Excellent Fletcher (need 3 more points to master).&lt;br&gt;Good<br/>
Smith. Master of all skills that can be mastered by<br/>
Druid except for Hand to Hand, Smithing, Jewelry,<br/>
Fletching, Pottery, and most languages (have however,<br/>
mastered Barbarian, and Dwarf... and gotten Elder Dragon<br/>
to Above Average).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... sorry. I&#39;m sorta<br/>
proud (probably excessively so) that I&#39;ve mastered so<br/>
many skills,and have so many languages. And only died<br/>
27 times at level 38. Course that doesn&#39;t mean I<br/>
know the game all that well. Just lucky.<br/>
=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS... if anyone in Drinal has any odd languages<br/>
mastered, I would LOVE to learn them. Don&#39;t know how much<br/>
ya&#39;ll would charge me though. I&#39;m about to have to<br/>
purchase 39 spells. Be a bit short on plat. I&#39;ve only got<br/>
250 in the bank and that means after spells, I&#39;ll<br/>
have 40 plat (if lucky).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
