<b>Subject:</b> Re: WHAT IS WRONG WITH EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-345139786">Must be your account, or your pc. I started my pc up and patched it <br/>
yesterday with no problem. However, when I went to sign in, it just <br/>
hung. And I was not able to alt tab out of it, so I had to hard power <br/>
my system down. This problem repeated itself everytime I logged in <br/>
until I remembered to check my firewall. Once I cleared eq for <br/>
access, I was able to get in with no problem.<br/>
  However, the nasty eq disconnect me for no reason happened within <br/>
15 minutes of being in game. Had to reboot. Got back in with no <br/>
problems and played smoothly for 2 hours before I camped out.<br/>
