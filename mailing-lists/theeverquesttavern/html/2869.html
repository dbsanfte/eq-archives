Some people are weak, and it frightens me their lack of self-<br/>
accountability, or better yet grasp of reality. Do they need help? <br/>
Sure do. Is Everquest to blame for this? When Gary Condit gives us a <br/>
straight answer. Whatever the opinions are for what the Stein&#39;s did <br/>
will be entirely subjective. The kid DID need order and to learn self-<br/>
control (something no game will ever provide anyway) but I do agree <br/>
blaming it on a video game is pretty ludicrous and asinine. I also <br/>
remember the case with the young man committing suicide and his <br/>
mother blaming it on Verant. Sad as it was, I was shocked and <br/>
annoyed. Again, self-accountability, something we Americans, by <br/>
individual, lack completely.<br/>
