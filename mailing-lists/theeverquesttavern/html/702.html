<b>Subject:</b> Smithing...please help <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656867840">hi all,&lt;br&gt;i just started smithing, i put five<br/>
practice points on it at my last lev up. i bought two<br/>
books on it so far, one about arms and armor and one<br/>
with the ingredients for a buncha different stuff i<br/>
think the book is basic blacksmithing. my first<br/>
question is do i need to find all the blacksmithing books<br/>
before i can smith? are they required? also, WHERE can i<br/>
find sharpening stones? i was told that they are good<br/>
for increasing the skill in the early stages but<br/>
nobody has them in felwithe or keleth. any advice on<br/>
this skill is most<br/>
appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks&lt;br&gt;Talrasha&lt;br&gt;10thlev Wiz&lt;br&gt;Veeshan</div>
