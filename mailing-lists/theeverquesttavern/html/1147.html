<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047472155">Is there any Monk on this Club? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m 11<br/>
lvl, and I just realized that I had Tiger Claw, so I&#39;m<br/>
using my monk as a hand-to-hand guy... but somebody<br/>
told me that this is not the strongest way of managing<br/>
a monk... the best way is using weapons. The other<br/>
thing is Tiger Claw better than Round Kick... or<br/>
what... Another payer told me not to carry much, in fact<br/>
less than 13 because i have repercusions.. does<br/>
anybody knows something about this...</div>
