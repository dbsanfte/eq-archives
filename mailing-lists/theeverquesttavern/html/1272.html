<div id="ygrps-yiv-477776226">A couple of nights ago I left the e-brake on my<br/>
car. The next morning it was frozen in place. Well, I<br/>
had to get to school on time so I drove, hoping it<br/>
would thaw out quickly. Well, it didn&#39;t. Now my<br/>
transmission is messed up and I have to get it fixed. I&#39;m a<br/>
little short on cash, so I really need to sell my lvl 47<br/>
cleric on Povar. I havn&#39;t played him in about 2 months.<br/>
He is kunark enabled, but not velious. He has about<br/>
180 wis w/ just decent items, 200 wis is very<br/>
obtainable. Some of his items include donals vambraces, totem<br/>
of warrior spirit. He is not very well known with a<br/>
great reputation, even before I stopped playing. I was<br/>
getting him ready to apply for one of the best guilds on<br/>
Povar, but I moved and never had a chance to follow<br/>
through. I kinda feel like a bum askin, but if anyone is<br/>
interested, at all, pls email me at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:stugger@...">stugger@...</a>. Im<br/>
not looking for big bucks, $150 would be plenty<br/>
enough, as I need cash decently quick. If I keep driving<br/>
on my tranny like this, its going to be poop when<br/>
summer comes around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks alot&lt;br&gt;bob d</div>
