<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037902486">Heya Kani, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve notice that I<br/>
post WAAAYYYY too much on both boards-- hehe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
have friends who have worked VERY hard to get good WIS<br/>
on their HE druids-- not an easy task. I think HE<br/>
rangers are pretty well balanced for melee, but still<br/>
need to work on WIS stuff. It was a LOT easier to get<br/>
my wood elf druid to a great WIS-- (187 at lvl 36)--<br/>
non twinked too. I don&#39;t have enough cash to upgrade<br/>
at all beyond what i have bought-- in fact, i&#39;m not<br/>
sure if i&#39;ll be able to afford my lvl 39 spells!!!!<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for starting points-- it depends on what you<br/>
want. The magical spells will advance quickly-- don&#39;t<br/>
worry about them. In a low level char, I usually put a<br/>
point or 2 to sense heading to get it going, maybe a<br/>
few to my primary weapon type (at low levels you&#39;ll<br/>
do a lot of melee and want to max out weapon<br/>
skills-- at higher levels you won&#39;t worry about it as<br/>
much). I have a habit of putting a point into all new<br/>
skills after i get them (some you HAVE to in order to<br/>
get them started). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than that, if you&#39;re<br/>
interested in trade skills, you may want to put a few<br/>
beginning points into them. At the lower levels, Tailoring<br/>
is cheap and easy-- you&#39;ll be getting silk and pelts<br/>
(well, if you&#39;re a RP druid, maybe not pelts) from the<br/>
get go-- save money by using the community loom.<br/>
Patterns are about 6sp each, and patchwork armor sells<br/>
back to merchants for over 1gp, so you&#39;re making<br/>
profit on successes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feel free to ask more ??<br/>
here or on EQDRUIDS club!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;xela</div>
