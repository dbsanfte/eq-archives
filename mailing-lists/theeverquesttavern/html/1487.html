<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389906658">You can trace the genre farther back than D&D,<br/>
look at Lord of the Rings and other novels that gave<br/>
ideas for D&D. I had a friend do a report for school on<br/>
the economics involved with the game. Not just the<br/>
ingame economy driven by supply and demand, but the vast<br/>
amounts of cash that Sony rakes in and how Verant keeps<br/>
the game running and attracting more clients.&lt;br&gt;Hope<br/>
you do well on it.&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf</div>
