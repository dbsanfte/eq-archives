<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798176935">Monks are a powerful but tricky class to play,<br/>
especially in their teens, before they get feign death. They<br/>
can outdamage other tanks and since have virtuall no<br/>
armor they can taunt monsters onto them, which means<br/>
death. Unless they are grouped with a warrior that knows<br/>
to pull stuff off them, they need to communicate<br/>
their role to the group. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also they can be a<br/>
pain for healers because they are taking too much<br/>
damage or just die fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Players who know how to<br/>
play the class well really shine, and I&#39;ve seen<br/>
several outstanding monks, and a bunch of really bad<br/>
ones. For that reason the class is never going to be<br/>
really popular. It&#39;s a good idea to work on your<br/>
throwing kill, so you can pull &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You also need good<br/>
friend to hold your loot for you since you can&#39;t carry<br/>
more than 15 lbs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the upside there aren&#39;t<br/>
too many classes you can outfit so<br/>
cheaply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, at high levels they are favored as pullers and<br/>
almost required for really hard places like the planes.</div>
