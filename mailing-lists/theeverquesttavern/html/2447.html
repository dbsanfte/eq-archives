<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702097951">[quote]But I&#39;ve been told that about 40% of<br/>
Drinal is 50+ or has a character 50+. From what I can<br/>
tell from the consensus of people-- that&#39;s probably<br/>
close to truth.[/quote]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wow, really? That&#39;s<br/>
pretty wild. But now that you mention it, yeah, there<br/>
does seem to be a surplus of high-level characters<br/>
sometimes. I was counting the number of Rogues once, and<br/>
noticed that there were more Rogues in there 50s than<br/>
1-49 combined, or close to it, anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where<br/>
did you hear this, anyway? I love weird statistical<br/>
stuff like this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Come to Sullon Zek -- a<br/>
high-level Paladin just gave my cleric a nice item. But<br/>
that&#39;s the first thing; at a similar level on Drinal, I<br/>
had stuff oozing out of my ears, people just keep<br/>
giving it to me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
