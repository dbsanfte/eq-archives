<b>Subject:</b> Video Card? and  What is twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-494042977">How is everybody? Looking forward to the<br/>
holidays? I have been considering using some of my soon to<br/>
be (hopefully) newfound Christmas wealth to purchase<br/>
a video card. Does anyone out there have any<br/>
suggestions of a good card for EQ? Right now I&#39;m leaning<br/>
toward a Voodoo 5. Expensive but I figure do it right<br/>
the first time, and you get what you pay for and all<br/>
that junk. I&#39;d really appreciate some more input and<br/>
suggestions though. As for what is twinking, I guess there<br/>
are different levels. It all depends on how much you<br/>
are willing to take from one of your characters to<br/>
give to another. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m against twinking<br/>
either. The way I see it someone had to go through the<br/>
process of being a naked newbie at some point, if they<br/>
want to give their hard earned cash and equipment to<br/>
another character that&#39;s their perogative. I think for me<br/>
it might take away from the enjoyment of earning the<br/>
stuff myself, but on the other hand... Boy I wish I had<br/>
a lot of Cool Stuff! Happy Hollidays everyone!</div>
