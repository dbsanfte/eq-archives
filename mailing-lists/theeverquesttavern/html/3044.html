<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296417568">Well, Folks, it is gonna take some time for me to get<br/>
back on.... longer than I thought.  It&#39;s amazing how<br/>
one day can screw up your life.....<br/>
<br/>
  It all started this morning.  I woke up at 5am due<br/>
to my Mom&#39;s friends (yes I still live with my Mom) <br/>
next I hung around the mall to chew up some time until<br/>
my date tonight.  So, After that I went to the leasing<br/>
office of the new apartment I am moving into...  My<br/>
credit was sour, and I&#39;ll end up having to pay 1130$<br/>
by next friday for a deposit on the apartment.  So, I<br/>
went to work to volenteer some extra time.  I worked<br/>
for 2 hours and got canned for not making $300 in that<br/>
time...  Yes, I got CANNED. I lost my job.  So, then I<br/>
left there stopped at my date&#39;s place of work.  And,<br/>
who do I see there?  Her ex.....  and, so, as she was<br/>
walking out I pulled her off to the side and come to<br/>
find out, the two of them had gotten back together 2<br/>
days ago right after I asked her out.....  And, she<br/>
was gonna leave me high and dry at the restaurant....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and, THAT is why it is gonna take me longer to get on<br/>
EQ than I thought. =(<br/>
<br/>
  Later all, (depressed)PsyKo<br/>
