<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103801021">Depends actually, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the rogue has SoW or<br/>
you&#39;re grouped with a Bard, Ranger, Necro, Druid, etc<br/>
that has a slow/snare affect.... you could catch them<br/>
and backstab them. (Or you could use it for potential<br/>
monster control. One strat we use in groups sometimes is<br/>
to fear adds if we have no chanter.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Course<br/>
the most interesting group I&#39;ve ever heard about is a<br/>
friend of mine that used to play. (He quit about 2 years<br/>
back.) He used to get on an all rogue group around lvl<br/>
30 to 40. I even think this was back before they<br/>
invented Instill Doubt but I never played a rogue till<br/>
recently-- sooooo... not for sure on that<br/>
one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, they used to gather around-- everyone<br/>
pickpocketed and backstabbed as often as possible. It was<br/>
truly sick amounts of damage. Mobs would just spin in<br/>
circles as agro switched to the one that just got<br/>
backstab off. But when 6 rogues have you<br/>
surrounded...someone can always backstab.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>
