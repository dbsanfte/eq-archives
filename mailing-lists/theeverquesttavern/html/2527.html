<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591753768">What he said about druids is right if you&#39;re<br/>
going for stats. A halfling druid will get you the best<br/>
stats and be an all around best kiter if you&#39;re looking<br/>
to solo. However, personally I prefer Wood Elf druid<br/>
simply b/c I love Kelethin. It&#39;s the one city I know<br/>
better than any other city in Everquest. I know it<br/>
better than Freeport and I spend a lot of time in<br/>
Freeport. Plus there&#39;s a lot of halfling druids in the game<br/>
simply cause stats are so important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;So I am<br/>
thinking Enchanter, Druid and yes the all around basher<br/>
Warrior.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since druid has been covered. I&#39;ll go next to<br/>
Enchanter. The best stat-wise there is Erudite. They give<br/>
you the best starting Wis and a good charisma to<br/>
boot. Second best and my personal favorite b/c it&#39;s<br/>
also really good stats and starts near Kelethin-- Plus<br/>
a bit better faction without losing night sight<br/>
(which Erudites don&#39;t get as the &quot;superior human&quot;).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High Elven enchanter. Another good one but with poorer<br/>
faction than Erudite is Dark Elven. Most people chose<br/>
this either for RP reasons or just b/c they look cool.<br/>
=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors. This is a meaty topic surprisingly. Most people<br/>
will tell you Barbarian, Trolls, Ogres make the best<br/>
warriors b/c the stats are great and they are large races.<br/>
This is important b/c Large races do not get stunned!<br/>
B/c of the faction and the fact I&#39;m bad with the evil<br/>
races--normally I would go with Barbarian stat-wise and<br/>
unstunnable-wise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I tend to play Half-elf warriors<br/>
b/c I get to start in Freeport-- which is my 2nd most<br/>
well known city (although I kinda know Halas by now).<br/>
And Half-elves get night vision as good as elves.<br/>
Their stats aren&#39;t nearly as good but they&#39;ve got in<br/>
general better faction. Since SoL though, I would have to<br/>
say being a Cat warrior is fun. I&#39;m not 100% certain<br/>
on how stats stack up but I believe Cats regen, have<br/>
night vision-- and decent warrior stats (Str, Sta,<br/>
Dex)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Stats: Enchanter-- you want a really high Int and<br/>
a decent Chars. Opinions vary on how high a Chars.<br/>
I would say 80+ if not 90+. With a high elf, dump<br/>
25 into int and 5 into chars. Enchanters are<br/>
generally pretty easy with stats. Your a bit weak-- str<br/>
determines how much you can carry. A few dump no more than 2<br/>
to 5 points into str b/c of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warrior--<br/>
more complex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Str determines how hard you hit,<br/>
average damage, how much you can carry. You&#39;re sometimes<br/>
the ML b/c you are so strong so this becomes<br/>
important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stam-- important b/c this is how many hitpoints you have<br/>
and how often you can swing weapons. Only really<br/>
important note here is-- make sure that it&#39;s close enough<br/>
that you can get it to 100 stam. After you hit over<br/>
100 stam, you never have to worry about stam again<br/>
b/c it doesn&#39;t fall if you&#39;re over 100. You can wield<br/>
the heaviest weapons with no problem then. (You<br/>
probably won&#39;t have the points to start like that<br/>
though.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dex-- Combined with Attack to determine how often you<br/>
hit. (&lt;--debated by some) Determines how often your<br/>
weapon procs if you have a proc and how often you hit<br/>
with a bow/range and how hard (important for the<br/>
puller.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dex and Str combine for how fast you<br/>
learn Melee skills. Agility is important but only<br/>
slightly for a warrior b/c the others are much more<br/>
needed. Agility determines how good your are at avoiding<br/>
damage. It&#39;s got other uses but that&#39;s the only real<br/>
important one to remember since it&#39;s not a really important<br/>
stat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? You&#39;d think you&#39;d want your warrior to dodge a<br/>
lot BUT... If you can never hit something or don&#39;t do<br/>
much damage, it won&#39;t keep agro no matter how good<br/>
your taunt. If it won&#39;t keep agro, then there&#39;s not<br/>
much of a point in you being the tank. And above all<br/>
else, a warrior is a tank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors at first do<br/>
damage, but higher level damage dealers are your Shaman,<br/>
Rogue, Monk, Wizard... followed closely by Magicians.<br/>
Warriors are your quintessential tanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
