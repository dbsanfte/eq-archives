<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295114902">At higher levels, everything seems<br/>
crippled.&lt;br&gt;(Most of my comments are from reading and from friends.<br/>
So, forgivenesses are in order on some<br/>
points).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rogues do a lot of damage but can&#39;t tank. Monks are<br/>
similar, although Rogues have more problems b/c they need<br/>
backstab. Rangers tank better but still-- I&#39;d group them<br/>
just slightly better than Rogues and Monks in tanking<br/>
and they do a lot less damage. However, their spells<br/>
are pretty cool in different situations. (SoW,<br/>
snares, etc).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors tank well but end up doing<br/>
like only what-- 10% or less of total damage at higher<br/>
levels? Wizzies do a ton of damage, but can&#39;t find a<br/>
group worth their salt and can&#39;t solo very well even<br/>
with Root and Snare. (A properly timed wizzie deals I<br/>
guess 25% of the damage and can waste their mana if<br/>
need be to pull ppl&#39;s behind out of the fire in a<br/>
pinch).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the more I see Wizzies in play-- the more I<br/>
realize that they are the hardest class to play.<br/>
Enchanters are also very hard to play but have soooo much<br/>
utility-- they&#39;re never without groups. Which makes things<br/>
easier. Plus they have very easy to define roles for<br/>
timing. Mezz, Haste, Clarity, etc. Wizzies have to learn<br/>
timing and that&#39;s HARD. Very hard. Knowing when to hit<br/>
that mob for 250 points of damage can be tricky.<br/>
(sorry to be so wordy.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Necro&#39;s are GREAT soloers<br/>
but dang... in a group-- sometimes they aren&#39;t more<br/>
than mana batteries. They&#39;re okay still around 30 but<br/>
I&#39;ve been told around 40... they and Shaman start to<br/>
slow down. Shaman at least still have lotsa stuff<br/>
groups can use. SoW, Debuffs, Buffs, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Druids<br/>
are good all around but can a lot of times feel<br/>
useless. We don&#39;t do anything super-well and lotsa ppl do<br/>
things better than us. I can usually find something to<br/>
do in a group though. And if need be, I can solo-- I<br/>
just hate doing it and don&#39;t do it well b/c I never<br/>
practice it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What class am I missing? Covered<br/>
Shaman, Rogue, Warrior, Monk, Ranger, Druid, Wizzies,<br/>
Enchants, and Necros. Ahh.. Magicians. Great pets-- but<br/>
each has their flaws. Root is both a blessing in a<br/>
curse. Great when overwhelmed... pitiful when one at a<br/>
time and snaring. Etc etc. Bards-- great in groups--<br/>
decent solo. Bards are good all around characters but<br/>
twisting can get tiring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over all, I&#39;d rate class<br/>
balancing pretty good except for Enchanters and Bards. But<br/>
I love those two groups too much to complain. Grin.<br/>
Those who&#39;ve grouped with them -- know. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A<br/>
combination of any classes makes for a fun group-- as long as<br/>
it&#39;s a full group. I&#39;ve had a group of Wizzie, 2<br/>
Druid, 2 Shaman, and an Enchanter and we killed faster<br/>
than any group I&#39;ve ever been in. (Group<br/>
bouncing/kiting)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Play whatever you&#39;re comfort with. Some ppl keep<br/>
telling me about the weaknesses of their characters at<br/>
higher levels. Least complaints come from Bards and<br/>
Enchanters. But man... almost any combo of melee and casters<br/>
can work. (under normal non-uber mob situations-- ei<br/>
Dragon Raids, etc).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love groups-- full<br/>
groups... 20% bonus to exp and more if you&#39;re grouped with<br/>
hybrids b/c of the way they add to exp when there are<br/>
hybrid classes. My advice of course is &quot;Group group<br/>
group and just enjoy your role and make friends.&quot; If<br/>
you know your role well... you should do well.<br/>
Friends will look for you to do things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>

hectic schedule making for no Everquest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS...<br/>
that of course-- explains my rambling.&lt;br&gt;Love<br/>
groups-- Everything from Bard/Enchant combo&#39;s, to<br/>
Bard/Snare/Rogue combos, to group getting mobs of Rogues, to Druid<br/>
tricks, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Group group group! =)</div>
