<div id="ygrps-yiv-914243164">I recently got dark age and wasn&#39;t sure if eq was<br/>
still any good, like people still playing it.&lt;br&gt;are<br/>
the servers stil crowded and did the expansion make<br/>
it better or worse? I loved eq but havn&#39;t played in<br/>
about 2 monhs and want to know if its still worth<br/>
paying for them both. Dark Age is fun but I miss good<br/>
old eq. if its still the same old game and the<br/>
expansion didnt ruin anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daven out</div>
