<div id="ygrps-yiv-41445839">Arg, I hate beggars. Can&#39;t stand that &quot;Can you<br/>
spare 2 plat?&quot; I need money too, I&#39;m working on<br/>
fletching and smithing.&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve gotten a lot of really cool<br/>
stuff just by chatting. Granted, this was for hours at<br/>
a time, but I made friends along the way and such.<br/>
Plus I thank them all the time. Newbies, be nice and<br/>
you may get something. Just don&#39;t expect<br/>
