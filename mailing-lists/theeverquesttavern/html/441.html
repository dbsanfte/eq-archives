<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429874081">Before, when I was a mere level 5 or so, my<br/>
Forage wasn&#39;t high enough to be of use. So I had to<br/>
tromp into Sneed&#39;s and buy milk and buy a couple<br/>
muffins in the Bakery.&lt;br&gt;Now, of course, I can just<br/>
rummage for food and find some whenever I want<br/>
(constantly resetting that button!) So, I figured, why not<br/>
give all that food I have around to others!??! So, for<br/>
an hour I sat in front of Qeynos with &quot;Merry<br/>
Christmas!&quot; hotkeyed and berries flying at every newbie!</div>
