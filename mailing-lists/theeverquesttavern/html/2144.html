<div id="ygrps-yiv-601898501">I have an idea, read my messages...i can&#39;t afford<br/>
to get a real ISP, mainly because MY PARENTS DONT<br/>
PAY FOR ALL MY SHIT... I know AOL sucks, but it is<br/>
what I have right now. In any case I don&#39;t think this<br/>
is a connection problem...it&#39;s something to do with<br/>
my computer...and I can&#39;t figure it out. So if<br/>
someone has some real advice for me I would love to hear<br/>
it...i&#39;m still trying to fix this thing.</div>
