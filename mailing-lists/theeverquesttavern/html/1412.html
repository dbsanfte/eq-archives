<div id="ygrps-yiv-749338504">Okay, if you&#39;re a DEF, you should be close to EC<br/>
(Nec forest, one zone away). Go there and kill orcs in<br/>
a group or zone again in NRO and kill the<br/>
tarantulas. You and one or two others should be able to<br/>
handle those just fine. Soon as you hit about 12 or 13,<br/>
I recommend Cuthroats in NRO at camps 2 or<br/>
3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heck, as a necro and using a fear, kite, skel tank, dot<br/>
combo... you probably could solo-- But I don&#39;t recommend<br/>
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? B/c at higher levels, grouping is the way to go.<br/>
EQ is a group oriented game. Groups help you get<br/>
over humps and make things more fun. (provided you are<br/>
a good grouper and that takes practice and other<br/>
players to teach).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I play druid and love to group.<br/>
I&#39;ve been worried b/c at higher levels (40 and above)<br/>
it gets to the point that a good group really only<br/>
needs 2 melee classes, 2 clerics, a bard and an<br/>
enchanter-- with either the bard or enchanter being<br/>
switchable with some other class-- probably nuker as long as<br/>
there&#39;s some mana regenerator in the group.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Versatility has it&#39;s price and have a friend lvl 46 shaman<br/>
who verified this... oh well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s why I<br/>
recommend you learn to group early. I&#39;ve developed a decent<br/>
reputation as a fun and good grouper and that should help me<br/>
later on (assuming I ever have the time to play EQ<br/>
more. LOL)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic</div>
