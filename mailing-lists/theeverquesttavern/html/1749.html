<b>Subject:</b> Re: thinking about EQ -- Part 2 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-877320224">Continued from previous post:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You&#39;ll find<br/>
people are extraordinarily helpful (on &quot;blue&quot; servers,<br/>
at least). High-levels watch you fight for your life<br/>
in the newbie zones, and will frequently give you<br/>
better gear than you have, and certainly help/heal if<br/>
you ask for it or need it. This is what hooked me on<br/>
the game -- folks who go out of their way to help you<br/>
find a corpse, or teach you about the game while<br/>
playing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, do you like to group or play solo? EQ is really<br/>
made for grouping, although you can solo at the lower<br/>
levels a bit. Sounds like you and the main man have a<br/>
ready-made group; you should browse the threads at the<br/>
official Everquest site to see discussions of what makes a<br/>
good two-person group, and plan accordingly. I once<br/>
ran across a team in their 50s that was fun to watch<br/>
-- a cleric (High Elf) and warrior (Ogre). Weird<br/>
combo, but it worked for them (even if they did refuse<br/>
to kill an Ogre NPC I wanted to loot; the big guy<br/>
didn&#39;t want to spoil his faction at home).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh,<br/>
yeah, that&#39;s another interesting thing about the game<br/>
-- faction. Basically, it&#39;s your standing with the<br/>
various NPC races and organizations. Want to play an<br/>
Ogre, but circulate among the Humans? Go kill a few<br/>
thousand orcs, and eventually NPCs in certain towns will<br/>
sell and talk to you, grudgingly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are<br/>
some sites to browse for tips:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.<br/>
www.EQAtlas.com -- a must. Good intro and map to almost every<br/>
zone in the game, links to discussions, bestiaries,<br/>
quests. I like to go into a zone blind the first time,<br/>
and then go get a map for further<br/>
exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. everquest.allakhazam.com -- another must,<br/>
although some of the info can be dated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.<br/>
www.Everlore.com -- your third place to be. Much player-supplied<br/>
info, so some of it should be taken with a grain of<br/>
salt. Don&#39;t know what the Skeleton Fist you looted is<br/>
for? Neither does anybody else on the site, but when<br/>
they do, they&#39;ll post it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.<br/>
www.everquest.com -- official site; the Newbie Zone discussion<br/>
board is OK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Various class-specific sites:<br/>
EQCleric.com (obvious); www.thesafehouse.org (indispensable<br/>
for my kind, Rogues). You might also try<br/>
&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/.">http://eq.castersrealm.com/.</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/.&lt;/a">http://eq.castersrealm.com/.&lt;/a</a>&gt; I found the guides at GameSpot<br/>
(&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/everquest_gg/index.html">http://www.gamespot.com/features/everquest_gg/index.html</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/everquest_gg/index.html&lt;/a">http://www.gamespot.com/features/everquest_gg/index.html&lt;/a</a>&gt;) very useful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, there you go, for now.<br/>
Just remember that your first few weeks will be the<br/>
best -- you don&#39;t know what anything does or how hard<br/>
it is to kill. Everything is new . . . And then<br/>
you&#39;ll get some levels, and find a new place to<br/>
adventure, and it&#39;s just like being a newbie again, except<br/>
that now you kinda know what you&#39;re doing with all the<br/>
buttons and stuff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck. Look me up on<br/>
Drinal or the new roleplaying server if you ever get a<br/>
CD key . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;Rogue<br/>
