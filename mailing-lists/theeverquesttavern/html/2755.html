<div id="ygrps-yiv-14593659">Some of the questions that have been asked in recent posts can be <br/>
answered at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.allakhazam.com/">http://www.everquest.allakhazam.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Some of the stuff at the site is old, but still a lot of the <br/>
resources available are pretty cool. Especially if you are running EQ <br/>
windows and can refer to the web site when needed.<br/>
<br/>
Also someone mentioned not being able to talk to someone on another <br/>
server. I thought that to be true too until a few days ago. I <br/>
discovered that you can send tells to ppl on other servers. I can&#39;t <br/>
remember the command right off... something like /tell [sever]:<br/>
[character] (exampble /tell Povar:Eressifar) That command may be <br/>
wrong so don&#39;t hold me to it. You can probably find the command in <br/>
the help files.<br/>
<br/>
Now a question of my own. I&#39;m a 21 Dark Elf Shadowknight and am new <br/>
to exploring Kunark. I&#39;m currently bound at the Overthere and am <br/>
hunting at Lake of Ill Omens. Going from OT to Loio is hard because A <br/>
LOT of stuff cons red to me. My question is, is there a better place <br/>
for me to be bound? And also what is the closest bank to Loio?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help. Feel free to send me a tell at anytime.<br/>
