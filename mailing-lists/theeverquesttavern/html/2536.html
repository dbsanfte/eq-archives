<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003472419">&quot;increased AGI translates into AC, which means<br/>
less hits and damage taken, which means less need for<br/>
healing, which means less chance for clerics getting<br/>
agro&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Admittedly, yes you would get hit less. And healing would be<br/>
less needed. But actually that causes Agro factor to<br/>
increase on clerics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re completely<br/>
invulnerable, you lose agro completely. Mobs only like to hit<br/>
you if you do a lot of damage to them AND they can do<br/>
damage to you. Taunt helps a lot. If you&#39;re a Ranger or<br/>
especially SK... you can really gain agro and keep it. Cause<br/>
nothing says hating like a good flame like/debuff or a<br/>
good blinding/snare from an SK. (In which case you<br/>
could justify the Agility)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pure warrior<br/>
should avoid agility b/c they&#39;ve got enough armor stuff<br/>
to increase AC as it is and damage/way to make and<br/>
hold agro. (Root is a good way to control agro and<br/>
adds if you don&#39;t have mezzers/charmers. Snare however<br/>
is better for overall mana)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rangers, Monks,<br/>
Rogues, SK and almost all casters are going to make it<br/>
hard to hold agro and keep you a &quot;true&quot; tank. Even<br/>
Paly&#39;s can hold agro better with their stun<br/>
series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.. all that typing to say.. &quot;I said<br/>
agility is not a factor b/c warriors were the point in<br/>
question.&quot;</div>
