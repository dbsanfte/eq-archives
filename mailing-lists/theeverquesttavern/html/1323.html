<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683082388">Actually, the best advice is always... Group<br/>
group group. It makes things more fun and the more you<br/>
group, the more ppl know you and want to group with you.<br/>
Plus it reduces down time. You kill things faster PLUS<br/>
you get an EXP BONUS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love groups and<br/>
consider myself a good grouper. Key to grouping is to know<br/>
what others are looking for. Do they need you to nuke<br/>
(as a wizzie.. probably), etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also know in a<br/>
group-- if you&#39;re with a druid or ranger-- probably don&#39;t<br/>
root unless you&#39;ve got a real need to switch tanks<br/>
(can&#39;t get aggro off ya). Snare is a LOT better in group<br/>
situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, know nuke timing. A lot of Wizzies just play like<br/>
a loose cannon. Then it becomes really hard to get<br/>
aggros off ya if they get loose from the tanks. (also<br/>
adds)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding a good group can be rough though at first, but<br/>
just keep at it. The benefit far outweighs the<br/>
hassles. But trust me-- there will be hassles. Finding ppl<br/>
that know the zone and can teach you is almost a must.<br/>
Teaching others the zone once you learn it is also good--<br/>
but it&#39;s up to them to learn. (Ex. I know Commons,<br/>
Ro, Oasis, Aviaks in SK, Lavastorm and Crushbone<br/>
outside castle area. But in other areas, I ask others for<br/>
advice and to learn.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>

sooo close to 22... *crosses my fingers for after<br/>
school tomorrow -- after doing Homework of course)</div>
