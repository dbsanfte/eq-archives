<div id="ygrps-yiv-481039910">Heh... I remember when I first fiddled with<br/>
Gamma. And even if it doesn&#39;t help anyone-- it at least<br/>
reminds of us stuff-- like how I need to go in and tweak<br/>
my colors some more so that I can read text in both<br/>
spell med and full screen modes. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also<br/>
reminds me that many ppl don&#39;t know that they can remap<br/>
all the keys. Got a friend whome functions almost<br/>
fully on just the numpad and uses the left hand<br/>
entirely to target party members and drop down to cast<br/>
spells.&lt;br&gt;(Tempted to remap inventory and use item myself&lt;br&gt;so that<br/>
I could come close to that.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve remapped<br/>
my auto attack to the ` key. That&#39;s been SUCH a life<br/>
saver. I know ppl that remap the key to &#39;z&#39; but I just<br/>
hit z by accident too much or know too many ppl with<br/>
z in their names. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS...<br/>
I&#39;ve discovered Begging is a TOUGH trade skill to get<br/>
to go up... =). Maybe I&#39;m biting off more than I can<br/>
chew doing, fishing, begging, tailoring, smithing, and<br/>
baking all at level 8. (25,5,0,21,1-- but lotsa food for<br/>
baking now and I&#39;ve bought myself a large sewing kit.<br/>
Whooohoo. Spider hunting- here I come. 4 threads do not a 1<br/>
in tailoring make. LOL)</div>
