crack at my computer. For some reason I can&#39;t get my new video card <br/>

long story short is my colors are all washed out and the icons are <br/>
huge!  But that&#39;s ok &#39;cause I am now on campus and life is good! LOL <br/>
it was so nice to wake up this morning(Friday) at 0900! The Raven <br/>

have to see if any of my friends are still on E&#39;ci.)</div>
