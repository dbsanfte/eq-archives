<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012588933">{&lt;Ah, yes, half elf druids are great, even if<br/>
I am as stupid as an unequipped wood elf<br/>
;)&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Hmmmmm... not sure if a care much for this<br/>
crack!!! haha}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ah, but it&#39;s true . . . I am one<br/>
stupid half elf . . . maybe you&#39;re just special,<br/>
Xela.&lt;br&gt;At lvl 34, with pretty decent equip, I&#39;m at 131 wis<br/>
. . . oh, poor me. :)&lt;br&gt;But I love being a druid.<br/>
I can go pretty much ANYWHERE . . . gotta love<br/>
those ports . . . wizzies would be great for that<br/>
reason, except they don&#39;t get SoW or scale of wolf--my<br/>
lifeblood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree about quests. I do any I can find, but<br/>
mostly only with my alts. Kan&#39;s too busy being begged<br/>
for ports and SoWs. hehe &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Kan, who is spoiled<br/>
by being a druid. Maybe that&#39;s why her alts are all<br/>
15 and lower. ;)</div>
