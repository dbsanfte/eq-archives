<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488019098">it is called play nice rules&lt;br&gt;you must share<br/>
the spawn if someone asks. taking turns and<br/>
such....this goes for spawns that drop items. you just have to<br/>
hope the thing drops on your turn. its has nothing to<br/>
do with exp so say you are camping something (you<br/>
get exp also) and a level 50 item farmer comes in and<br/>
wants to share, you have to. it sucks i know but this<br/>
keeps things in the plane area calmed down. that is<br/>
what i got from a GM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;elif serabaar&lt;br&gt;level 32<br/>
