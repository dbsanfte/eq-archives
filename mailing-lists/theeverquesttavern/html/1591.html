<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794043253">This is a great article, Kharlisht!! Very<br/>
interesting. I have seen the flirting issue from both sides--<br/>
as i play a male and a female character, and enjoy<br/>
talking, chatting and flirting all the time. When I&#39;m in a<br/>
group, I talk a LOT between battles. I like to :wink,<br/>
/smile, /blush, etc. and like to keep everyone happy. I<br/>
would not get married (my characters or too young to be<br/>
tied down-- hehe), but I think it&#39;s fun that others<br/>
do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good players and people are hard to find.<br/>
I love to group with people I know, and I&#39;m sad if<br/>
those people leave me behind (ie. get too far ahead in<br/>
levels so that we don&#39;t group together any more) or I<br/>
leave them behind. If you find someone you like playing<br/>
the game with, why not marry them? Isn&#39;t that much<br/>
like real life?? My only questions is this: If a male<br/>
char and female char, controlled by RL people from<br/>
California (or other community property state) split up--<br/>
does the femal char. get 1/2 of the male chars armor,<br/>
weapons, items and cash in bank????&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just<br/>
wondering....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 20th season&lt;br&gt;Tactics<br/>
