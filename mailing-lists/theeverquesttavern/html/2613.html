this.   You petition a GM to do the change.   Normally this means an <br/>
area that is not used much for the event like Arena or Temple of Ro <br/>
though I have seen Surefall and heard of Xorbb&#39;s Throne(charm and <br/>
park mobs in corner).  The rest is Food(cakes), Drink(fruit juice or <br/>
the good stuff), party favors(see a gnome), and presents.   Some even <br/>
get a band of bards to play on the side for dancing(levitation helps <br/>
here)   But make sure a few times that the GM will be there.  They <br/>
dont keep records of this stuff so petition and make sure that the Gm <br/>
you are talking to can personally do the service. <br/>
