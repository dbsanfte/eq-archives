<div id="ygrps-yiv-263530349">1. Someone else can explain it probably much better than I can but what I think you&#39;re talking about is the bar that&#39;s showing your connection.  The one that if it goes to you&#39;re zero, you&#39;re heading for your desktop. ;-) You can toggle it off and on with F11 if you get tired of seeing it.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Sites?  There&#39;s a whole host of them.  These are a few I use.<br/>

Those will get you started at least along with the links they provide.  And I&#39;m sure there are members here that have other ones too.  There are also usually at least one really good server site per server.  At least I know there is for Mith Marr and Bristlebane...the two servers I play on.  Good luck and happy hunting.  Welcome to Norrath (that Evercrack state of mind. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
  Thanks for responding to my new to online gaming post<br/>
<br/>
  I picked up the trilogy package, started this afternoon and 9 hours <br/>
  later can see why is referred to as Evercrack.  Started as a wood elf <br/>
  ranger.  2 questions:<br/>
  1. On the main screen middle right is a green bar with a number, a <br/>
  percentage, a second percentage, another number (always changing, <br/>
  what is it ? I couldn&#39;t find it in the manual.<br/>
<br/>
  2. Also any recommendations on sites/guide for a good EQ lingo <br/>
  glossary.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks Again<br/>
<br/>
