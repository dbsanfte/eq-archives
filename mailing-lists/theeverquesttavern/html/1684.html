<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794907849">Don&#39;t forget about THE best Kaladim quest-- belts<br/>
and shoulderpads from the evil orcs in Crushbone!!!<br/>
Can&#39;t Pallys also do the Corflunk&#39;s head quest? Kaladim<br/>
is full of good low-mid level quests, and then some<br/>
higher ones that send you on great adventures across the<br/>
worlds. (Much better that the ONE lame quest for wood-elf<br/>
druids in Kelethin-- &quot;uh....go and get me some rusty<br/>
weapons. That will make Tunare happy, cuz we don&#39;t like<br/>
pointy things that are rusty. Oh, except<br/>
scimitars...we&#39;re ok with those, I guess.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IMHO-- the game<br/>
is called Ever&quot;QUEST&quot; for a reason. There are tons<br/>
of quests you can get in any number of cities.<br/>
Talking to NPCs to figure out who they are, how they fit<br/>
into the world, and what they&#39;d like you to do for<br/>
them, is a large part of the fun. AND-- some quests are<br/>
just plain great for quick XP. At certain levels, the<br/>
CB belt and pad quests will powerlevel you. The<br/>
point, though, is that questing can be a lot of fun, and<br/>
give you some direction and purpose. This is<br/>
especially great if you like to roll play a little.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m currently working on my mage focus items quests,<br/>
which is proving to be quite challenging. My druid<br/>
character doesn&#39;t seem to get as many quests as other<br/>
classes, and the few good ones require LONG camps-- which<br/>
I think hurts the game. Initial symbol quest??<br/>
UGH-- i&#39;ve been tracking and hunting rancorous ghasts<br/>
in Lfay off and on for a long time. I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
lucky enough to find a dozen in that time-- NONE have<br/>
given up a heart. I need 4 hearts to finish the quest.<br/>
Is this likely to happen??????&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t be<br/>
discouraged, though. Just move to another quest!!! Quest<br/>
on!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
