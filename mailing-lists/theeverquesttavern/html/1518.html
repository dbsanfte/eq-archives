<div id="ygrps-yiv-743399758">I love that post!! I don&#39;t get plat beggers that<br/>
often (but i DO get the SOW/Bind beggers-- NEARLY as<br/>
bad as plat beggars!!). Maybe it&#39;s because they can<br/>
sense that I don&#39;t have much to spare-- maybe it&#39;s the<br/>
fact that I still have a LOT of LEATHER items at lvl<br/>
20, and am not some twinked out EQ steroid monster.<br/>
Oops-- lost my temper there -- hehe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I totally<br/>
agree that a random twink is ok - for a lvl 1-3, i have<br/>
no prob giving some silver (maybe gold) to if I see<br/>
them roll playing well, fighting well, sacrificing<br/>
their safety to help others. If you&#39;re a good player,<br/>
you sometimes need to be rewarded, because we all<br/>
know that EQ is full of bad players and greedy<br/>
players. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For anyone who&#39;s been there, you know<br/>
that Orc Hill is a KS paradise. Don&#39;t group with<br/>
warriors who won&#39;t share loot with their healer. Let them<br/>
know right off that you need loot for spells, which<br/>
will make you more valuable to them. If they don&#39;t<br/>
share, move on. There are usually 100 players in GFay on<br/>
Xev at night. There are always low players willing to<br/>
group. (as an aside, don&#39;t bother grouping until after<br/>
lvl 5 anyway-- you can solo tons of stuff, collect<br/>
bone chips for your guild quest, and save all the xp<br/>
and loot for yourself). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, my 2sp worth<br/>
(ugh! inflation-- haha).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid<br/>

brews</div>
