<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241345947">i have to agree with david on this point.  <br/>
scapegoatism (for lac of a better word/or non word) is/has been prevelant umong state societies for over 8000 years<br/>
its so much easier to pick and something and make it the &quot;evil&quot; than to truly examine our own lives and culture for potential faults.  humans (or all mammals for that matter) are addictive my nature, or you could say are driven internally to find patterns of behavior and lean on them.  anything can be an addiciton, from the ritual you do when you start your day to the things you read, eat, the excersize you do.  also anything that involves social behavoir as in chatting with friends can be very addictive.  being social is also an intinctive drive. this is one of the great difficulties in breaking unhealthy habbits like smoking for instance in that it often involves having friends who also smoke and sharing and being friendly while doing so.  if someone doesnt have much of a social life when they begin playing then the involvement that EQ requires with others as you get higher in levels could fill that need and being in a guild can for some create a psudo family.  <br/>
perhaps it would be more productive to examine what is missing from society rather than attacking games, music or any non traditional group activities that are filling in that void.<br/>
<br/>
just my humble thoughts<br/>

  about to draw a line between real and make believe is not new, <br/>
  shocking or uncommon.   Everquest and other MMORPGs are fantasies <br/>
  that we use to relieve stress and put the world away.   back in the <br/>
  70s we were playing Dungeons and Dragons for the same.<br/>
     For some couping with the real world or people is too much and <br/>
  they drive deeper into the fantasies we provide with our stories.   <br/>
  IS the problem with the GAME? no not really we are venting their <br/>
  issues and in some ways showing a differant path to mental health.<br/>
<br/>
     A few people every year suicide because of role playing.  Why? <br/>
  becuece they put too much of them selves into their charactors.  FOr <br/>
  some it was they brought their toons into the real world and died <br/>
  thinking they could have special powers if they really tried(guess <br/>
  the pavement disagreed).   For others their toon was them( the real <br/>
  world person locked them selves in their own minds and only <br/>
  interacted as the toon.( most of these we lock up in time but some <br/>
  are missed)   IN everquest most people have at least 3 toons( think I <br/>
  have 11 on 3 servers over 3 years)  this helps blur this line of who <br/>
  they are in game and keeps them from getting fixated on one persona. <br/>
<br/>
      RPGers have Always been outside the main stream so more of us are <br/>
  crazy or at least abnormal( as if we would wish to be normal).  <br/>
  Society has always labeled us as devil worshipers or crazy.   We meet <br/>
  in small rooms in back of comic shops becuase churches us.    For <br/>
  every suicide or killing( gamers were blamed for school shootings <br/>
  REGULARLY) we all are blamed by society.<br/>
<br/>
  And on a last note back in the early 80s a book titled (What is <br/>
  Dungeons and Dragons?) written by a pair of British gamers detailing <br/>
  the history and world of RPGs for the main stream person is a great <br/>
  aid for anyone writing about RPG MMORPG or gamers in general.   IT <br/>
  final shut my mother up on believing the bad press we always get.   <br/>
  THis is not the first 60 minutes story  done attacking gameing and <br/>
  far for the last( look at their type of viewers.. give the masses <br/>
  what they want... worked for the Romans) <br/>

  &gt; In the defence of the game,  Ben Stien was responsible<br/>
  &gt; for his son playing this game in the first place.  In<br/>
  &gt; the opening game sequence in agreeing to the contract,<br/>
  &gt; a person must be of lawful age or have the consent of<br/>
  &gt; a parent or legal guardian.  Unless of course, his<br/>
  &gt; father didn&#39;t know, then his son was pursuing illegal<br/>
  &gt; activities. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;  And, about his solution.  Sending his son to boarding<br/>
  &gt; school.... LMAO  don&#39;t take the kid away from video<br/>
  &gt; games, take video games away from the kid.  I mean<br/>
  &gt; SERIOUSLY.  Any child that would not abide by the<br/>
  &gt; house rules isn&#39;t too well raised anyway.. he says he<br/>
  &gt; heard his son playing in the middle of the night... he<br/>
  &gt; shoulda picked his kid up by the collar and beat the<br/>
  &gt; ever lovin %^*$ out of him.... I gaurantee, he would<br/>
  &gt; reconsider breaking the rules if he knew there would<br/>
  &gt; be consiquences... obviously this kid had more<br/>
  &gt; problems thanm just video games...<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   Don&#39;t even get me started about the suicidal punk on<br/>
  &gt; 48 hours either......   I hate to sound cold and<br/>
  &gt; lacking in compassion, but quite frankly she asked for<br/>
  &gt; the view of the players, she undoubtedly SAW 48 hours<br/>
  &gt; in the first place, and it was most likely what<br/>
  &gt; provoked the choice of senior thesis.<br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, anyone who would be so afflicted<br/>
  &gt; &gt; by<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; the outcome of a game is not a terribly stable<br/>
  &gt; &gt; person<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; in the first place.  Everquest has actually helped<br/>
  &gt; &gt; me<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; save money for tuition, and has kept me out of<br/>
  &gt; &gt; trouble<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; as well.  I sit at home and play EverQuest for a<br/>
  &gt; &gt; few<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; hours every night.  With a starting cost of 9.95<br/>
  &gt; &gt; for<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; the game, 12.95 a month for a pre-paid card (I<br/>
  &gt; &gt; hate<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; credit cards), I get the first month free, 19.99 a<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; month in internet services (which I would have<br/>
  &gt; &gt; anyway)<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Everquest is a subliminal addiction, just like<br/>
  &gt; &gt; certain people setting <br/>
  &gt; &gt; all things aside for football... on a much lesser<br/>
  &gt; &gt; scale of course <br/>
  &gt; &gt; because quite frank, there is absolutely no<br/>
  &gt; &gt; redeeming value of <br/>
  &gt; &gt; dedicating one&#39;s entire time and achieving something<br/>
  &gt; &gt; in a video game <br/>
  &gt; &gt; besides personal satisfaction (unless it&#39;s some<br/>
  &gt; &gt; godawful tournament <br/>
  &gt; &gt; which I can&#39;t ****ing stand). It all depends on the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; individual. <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Certain people can set rigid guidelines for<br/>
  &gt; &gt; themselves (play for a <br/>
  &gt; &gt; certain number of hours) and abide by them, and some<br/>
  &gt; &gt; people can&#39;t. <br/>
