<div id="ygrps-yiv-695097851">yeah.. a bit heavy. But Damage: 25 Delay: 40 is a<br/>
very nice damage ratio. 1.6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure at later<br/>
level there can be better but... it&#39;s a 1h slash that<br/>
deals a hefty punch. I find with Dual wield... I like<br/>
to have something with a large kick in the primary<br/>
and something super fast in the secondary. That way<br/>
dual wield usually activates more (course it&#39;s been a<br/>
while since I&#39;ve played a warrior with dual wield...<br/>
maybe they&#39;ve changed it. Egad. Can it really be 2<br/>
years ago?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But everyone has a different way of<br/>
playing. Wurmslayer also gives you +5 STR, +5 Magic<br/>
Resistance, 5 AC to compensate a bit for it&#39;s heaviness<br/>
though. 15 pounds but 5 str to me just means the item is<br/>
actually 10 pounds and gives you +5 mr and 5 ac to boot<br/>
with a 1.6 ratio. Not too shabby till you&#39;re 40 or 45.<br/>
Not what you&#39;d want to train 1hs...<br/>
but.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.. forgot to say. I hunted Ice<br/>
Giants, Cougars, and in OT as well till level 40. Still<br/>
sometimes hunt some IG&#39;s.</div>
