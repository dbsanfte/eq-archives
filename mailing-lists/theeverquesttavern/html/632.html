<div id="ygrps-yiv-836675558">Ever been in a group thinking man this really<br/>
s#$%^? One of those groups where nobody knows what<br/>
they&#39;re doing? &lt;br&gt;Sigh had it happen last night we<br/>
started out great. Xaiver Human Shadow Knight and by now<br/>
a friend and daily hunting partner Zorbdak the best<br/>
litle kick ass halfling druid I ever had the pleausure<br/>
to group with and Ltle old me. We met up with a<br/>
ranger and i thouhg great we have a good puller here...<br/>
But that turned out wrong. we where then in a chaos<br/>
group. Everybody just pulled something and I still<br/>
haven&#39;t forgiven Xaiver for pulling a Deepwater croc in<br/>
Oasis. Ha well he died I barly made it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We went<br/>
back to North Ro to check derv camps as usual ofcourse<br/>
they where all camped. Butt at camp 2 where 2 people<br/>
in that group I&#39;d grouped with before. So I went<br/>
over and ask nicley if they would very much would mind<br/>
sharing the spawn... (yes we Dark Elfs can play nice too)<br/>
That wasn&#39;t a problem and for a moment the old magic<br/>
was back. We got a Wiz and Pally in aswell at this<br/>
time and Dervs had litle on us... Until Zorbdak had to<br/>
log...the ranger lost connection and the wiz ran of all the<br/>
time to go and sell/buy stuff at the plat, getting<br/>
himself killed in getting there twice. In the meantime<br/>
the Pally just refused to do anything but<br/>
tank...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So there we are 2 shadow knights and a paladin...<br/>
Sure we can take out a derv at a time but it just<br/>
costs us to much and sometimes you pull several at<br/>
once.. and hey what about those casters?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We<br/>
couldn&#39;t get a healer Xaiver and I stormed the camp out of<br/>
pure frustration when the other group was selling. We<br/>
had four dervs on us. We got them ll with the two of<br/>
us (Pally was afk). And it did feel rather nice ;-)<br/>
but I had 2 bubbles health left and Xaiver had 3 and<br/>
sitting on your bumm all the time to heal up is not my<br/>
idea of fun.&lt;br&gt;I ended up getting frustated and<br/>
Xaiver was too. So I made up an excuse and left. I<br/>
didn&#39;t even want to play anymore so I logged. All in all<br/>
one of my worst days in Norath :(</div>
