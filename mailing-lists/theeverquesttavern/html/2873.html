<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527095796">Sorry I had to paste this from the letter that bounced<br/>
and it must have gotten cut off.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;    On the other hand, it cuts you off from anything<br/>
 </span></blockquote>social or deemed acceptable by society.  So, if you<br/>
are in a transitional phase in your life (traveling<br/>
salesman, bored on summer break, or even without<br/>
friends) it is a perfectly fine way to pass the time,<br/>
and maybe save a little money in the process.  But, if<br/>
you are involved in a serious or time consuming<br/>
engagement of some kind, social or other it is not<br/>
recomended that you play this to excess.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Kudos on the comment about Americans lacking<br/>
 </span></blockquote>accountability.  That happens when you try to please<br/>
everyone.  To twist a line from a movie,  Americans<br/>
believe morals are paintings on walls and scruples are<br/>
a form of money in russia.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fun topic tho, ill talk to you guys later, <br/>
