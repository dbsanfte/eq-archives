<b>Subject:</b> Innoruuk&#39;s Bane <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-320797357">Finally, after much putzing by the gods, the<br/>
guild of Innoruuk&#39;s Bane has been formed on the<br/>
Mathaniel Marr Server! Innoruuk&#39;s Bane is a guild devoted<br/>
to conquest against evil and hatred all over<br/>
Norrath. Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves, Shadowknights, and<br/>
Necromancers all stand for virtues that are against those of<br/>
Innoruuk&#39;s Bane and thus may not be members. As the name<br/>
suggests, the guild is primarily against the Tier&#39;Dal and<br/>
wars with the Dark Elven race will be frequent and<br/>
unmerciful. For all of those who feel the same way about the<br/>
Darkness that is spreading over our beloved Norrath,<br/>
please post a message here saying so, or send a /tell to<br/>
Durran, Jeruss, Oladahn, or Trellan on the Mathaniel Marr<br/>
Server. May your heart guide you to the right choice so<br/>
that we may save our world from these horrendous<br/>
evils!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trellan Hawksight, Wood Elf Ranger of 22 seasons.</div>
