<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692192288">Here&#39;s a really good story! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day I was<br/>
wandering around these sand dunes looking for someone give<br/>
me some cash*laugh*and I saw 10 players all sitting<br/>
at the docks casting spells on each other.Since I<br/>
was a Warrior I usually acceoted any spell,so I<br/>
rushed over and asked them to cast some spells on me and<br/>
perhaps give me some gold.What luck! 6 of them were level<br/>
46 paladins and the rest were thinking of a way to<br/>
get rid of something so they would not be<br/>
encumbered.I got 134 platinum and since I was a newbie at the<br/>
time they cast 4 different spells on me even though I<br/>
had no idea what they did I was glad to get them! As<br/>
I ran away to the nearest merchant I turned around<br/>
to wave at people who had so graciously given me the<br/>
money I saw a big thing that was yellow coming over the<br/>
hills. I clicked on it and it said it was a sand giant!<br/>
I yelled at all the players at the docks to jump<br/>
into the water because there was a sand giant.They all<br/>
did so except 2 who had could only speak<br/>
French(really!)coming from Canada I tried to think of how to say it as<br/>
the giant got closer and closer to the pair. the<br/>
giant was meters away so my level 1 Dark Elf ran to the<br/>
dock and jumped in the water to show what the others<br/>
were doing.The two Wood Elves typed in several<br/>
question marks and I gave up. I ran back to the hill and<br/>
could only watch as they sat back down and continued<br/>
resting.the sand giant came up behind one and killed her in 3<br/>
hits before she could even react and he chased the<br/>
other female for 1 minute or so since I was following<br/>
the chase to see what would happen and just as she<br/>
was going to reach a guard all her stamina ran out I<br/>
can only guess because she stopped jumping and he<br/>
caugfhr her and killed her as well.I ran back to the<br/>
docks and was thanked by the low level players for<br/>
saving them and given some more weapons and spells.I sat<br/>
with them for 5 minutes and then I saw the 2 Wood<br/>
Elves coming over the dunes to collect their<br/>
bodies.They cmae to where I was and started getting real mad<br/>
at me! They followed me arounf the whole desert for<br/>
an hour asking me in french to not be a coward and<br/>
duel them.I finally took the easy way out and circled<br/>
around a tree and used the hide command.I stayed still<br/>
for 10 minutes as they searched and searched for<br/>
me.Finally,they gave up and ran as fast as I could to another<br/>
zone!the moral of this story is:DON&#39;T GET<br/>
INVOLVED!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. If you ever come across Sadum and Ziya tell them<br/>
that Vanelen(me)tried:)</div>
