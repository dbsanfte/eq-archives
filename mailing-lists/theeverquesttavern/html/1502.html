<div id="ygrps-yiv-505460054">as an ex school teacher i have to disagree with<br/>
the person who said don&#39;t use to many visuals. when a<br/>
students knows what he or she is talking about that is<br/>
great...they get an a. when a student shows extra thought and<br/>
creativity they get the a (even if they are a little less<br/>
knowledgeable) Teachers love to see thought and creativity.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would not use powerpoint. here are few<br/>
ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*make a packet for each student. include your outline<br/>
and some info about the game. make your cover your<br/>
favorite character. depending on your funds you could go<br/>
to yuor local copy store and have them bound or buy<br/>
the plastic report covers.&lt;br&gt;after passing them out<br/>
to the class you can break the ice by introducing<br/>
your character. who are they. where they are from.<br/>
skills they acel at. its race, class. goals<br/>
etc..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*bring some type of &quot;unique&quot; visual aid. If you are<br/>
going to talk about armor and weapons make (out of felt<br/>
or whatever) some replicas for barbie and have them<br/>
set up on desk. or when talking about skills bake<br/>
some goodies to pass around to class. call them<br/>
batwing munchies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;there are a million ides you<br/>
could do. you can&#39;t do all. pick one and make it work<br/>
for you. just be creative and show that you put a lot<br/>
of thought into your presentation and you will do<br/>
great!</div>
