<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608318382">Hi all,&lt;br&gt;I am new to the list and wanted to say<br/>
hi. I also wanted to tell everyone about my new site,<br/>
Behind EQ. Its a site for the players, not the game, of<br/>
Everquest. On the site you can read profiles that players<br/>
have submitted about themselves. It has every server<br/>
and players can also submit their own profiles. The<br/>
URL is &lt;a href=http://www.behindeq.com. target=new&gt;http://www.behindeq.com.&lt;/a&gt; Please visit the<br/>
site. Thanks and I&#39;ll talk to ya soon!</div>
