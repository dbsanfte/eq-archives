<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142531463">**(Necro advise) I personally always save enough<br/>
mana to Feign Death and Gate. Always have FD (if you<br/>
are a necro, SK, or monk) memed, always have Gate<br/>
memed, and invis is also a good one to have memed. If<br/>
you are about to die and something is aggroed on you<br/>
then FD. Gate will be interupted so use FD to get them<br/>
off of you then when they walk away gate. FD still<br/>
works for 15 min (I think) so you can lie there for a<br/>
while if you have to.&lt;br&gt;**Making a pet can be good AND<br/>
bad in a dungen. An extra tanks is always nice BUT<br/>
pets will follow runner isn&#39;t killed quickly with the<br/>
pet behind it, then the pet will have other things<br/>
attack it. When your pet dies those things will come<br/>
after YOU. I had a pet chase a runner and he died and<br/>
sent me 3 gators, 2 Zelots, a Judicar, and a Sent. We<br/>
had just finished fighting 4 gators and a pro so we<br/>
were low mana and health. The cleric and Mage died and<br/>
the rest of us barely made it. Because of this, I&#39;m<br/>
leary of using a pet in a dungen because in a melee<br/>
it&#39;s hard to keep track of your pet.&lt;br&gt;**ALWAYs<br/>
ALWAYS tell your group if you are AFK. One time the<br/>
shaman who was the group healer went AFK without telling<br/>
anyone. Things went bad really fast and she and the tank<br/>
died while she was AFK. She was quickly booted from<br/>
the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is all the advice i can think<br/>
of right now. Hope this helps!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Aeday<br/>
