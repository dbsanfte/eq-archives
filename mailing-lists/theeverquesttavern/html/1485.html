<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712202828">Hrmm.. any chance they&#39;ve got fancy Computer<br/>
Overhead display? If so, I think it&#39;d be cool if you could<br/>
do a PowerPoint Presentation or something along<br/>
those lines with screenshots of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If<br/>
not... Explain the basic concepts of the games, but it<br/>
also depends on what kind of report you&#39;re<br/>
doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it&#39;s supposed to be a persuasive speech... talk<br/>
about how addicting and how 300,000+ accounts are with<br/>
EQ... etc etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If not, also talk about it&#39;s<br/>
negatives and positives if it&#39;s just a synopsis. How it can<br/>
take too much time, how it&#39;s hard to get items, but<br/>
also how much fun it is to play, how sweet a lot of<br/>
the graphics are, tradeskills galore... etc.<br/>
