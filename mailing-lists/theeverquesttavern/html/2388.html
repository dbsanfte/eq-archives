<b>Subject:</b> Favorite Ranger Quest at lvl 38 ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608474760">Hey folks,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just wanted to know if anyone<br/>
had some good quests ideas to do at lvl 38 as a<br/>
ranger. Just did the cougarskin mask (AC6 +2agi +2dex<br/>
+10hp) and direwolf cloak (AC7 +5str) quest last night<br/>
in Iceclad. Very easy and the items are pretty good<br/>
considering the ease of aquiring the correct items. They<br/>
certainly beat the banded armor items i was<br/>
wearing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think im next going to my enchanted bow quest.<br/>
Seems pretty easy for the most part with the exception<br/>
of killing the mermaid in Kedge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;all ideas<br/>
and suggestions are open )</div>
