&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; To:  The Salisbury Post, North Carolina <br/>
&gt; &gt; We, the undersigned, are outraged at the refusal<br/>
&gt; of a request to <br/>
&gt; list <br/>
&gt; &gt; a Pagan/Wiccan Study Group - Magickal Moon in the<br/>
&gt; Salisbury Post, <br/>
&gt; &gt; which is located in Salisbury, North Carolina. The<br/>
&gt; reason given <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the request by the FAITH Copy Editor was both<br/>
&gt; ignorant and <br/>
&gt; &gt; discriminatory. &quot;The Salisbury Post FAITH section<br/>
&gt; is for people <br/>
&gt; who <br/>
&gt; &gt; believe in God&quot; and &quot;this is not the image that<br/>
&gt; The Post wants to <br/>
&gt; &gt; portray.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The Salisbury Post&#39;s mission statement says in<br/>
&gt; part: <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;We are a marketing and customer driven company<br/>
&gt; whose mission is <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; inform, educate and entertain. We strive to mirror<br/>
&gt; the unique <br/>
&gt; &gt; communities we serve and offer responsible public<br/>
&gt; forum.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We fail to see how denying a Pagan/Wiccan study<br/>
&gt; group an equal <br/>
&gt; space <br/>
&gt; &gt; with other congregations fulfills this mission<br/>
&gt; statement. The <br/>
&gt; &gt; decision was made with personal prejudices and not<br/>
&gt; handled with a <br/>
&gt; &gt; professional demeanor. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Regardless of whether or not Paganism is The<br/>
&gt; Salisbury Post&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; religion, it is our religion. The Federal<br/>
&gt; Government recognizes <br/>
&gt; &gt; Paganism/Wicca, as an official religion. Military<br/>
&gt; Courts of <br/>
&gt; Justice <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the U.S. have also found Wicca to be a valid<br/>
&gt; religion, <br/>
&gt; deserving <br/>
&gt; &gt; of protection under the First Amendment of the<br/>
&gt; U.S. Constitution. <br/>
&gt; In <br/>
&gt; &gt; the case United States v. Phillips, (42 M.J. 346)<br/>
&gt; in 1995) the <br/>
&gt; &gt; concurring opinion by Judge Wiss stated: &quot;First,<br/>
&gt; Wicca is a <br/>
&gt; socially <br/>
&gt; &gt; recognized religion. It is acknowledged as such by<br/>
&gt; the Army. <br/>
&gt; &gt; See `Dept. of the Army (DA) Pamphlet 165-13-1,<br/>
&gt; Religious <br/>
&gt; Requirements <br/>
&gt; &gt; and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A<br/>
&gt; Handbook for <br/>
&gt; Chaplains&#39; <br/>
&gt; &gt; (April 1980), revising A Pamphlet 165-13,<br/>
&gt; `Religious Requirements <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook<br/>
&gt; for Chaplains&#39; <br/>
&gt; &gt; (April 1978). Further, it is acknowledged as such<br/>
&gt; in courts of <br/>
&gt; law.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Pagans and Wiccans are a part of your community.<br/>
&gt; We are your <br/>
&gt; &gt; neighbors, your coworkers, your children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; teachers; we are <br/>
&gt; &gt; professionals, but most importantly we are your<br/>
&gt; readers - your <br/>
&gt; &gt; customers! As engraved on your building and<br/>
&gt; imprinted on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Opinion/Editorial page of the paper &quot;The truth<br/>
&gt; shall make you <br/>
&gt; free&quot;; <br/>
&gt; &gt; misconceptions about pagans, and being denied<br/>
&gt; access to public <br/>
&gt; forum <br/>
&gt; &gt; makes it all the more difficult for the truth to<br/>
&gt; make any of us <br/>
&gt; free. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Due to the fact that this request was handled in<br/>
&gt; an unprofessional <br/>
&gt; &gt; manner and with personal bigotry, we, the<br/>
&gt; undersigned, as well as <br/>
&gt; &gt; members of our family and friends, who are both of<br/>
&gt; the Christian <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; Pagan faith will not support The Salisbury Post.<br/>
&gt; We will no longer <br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; a part of your readership until this matter is<br/>
&gt; reconciled with a <br/>
&gt; &gt; formal apology and the list is made public in The<br/>
&gt; Salisbury Post. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;We are not evil. We don&#39;t harm or seduce people.<br/>
&gt; We are not <br/>
&gt; &gt; dangerous. We are ordinary people like you. We<br/>
&gt; have families, <br/>
&gt; jobs, <br/>
&gt; &gt; hopes, and dreams. We are not a cult. This<br/>
&gt; religion is not a joke. <br/>
&gt; We <br/>
&gt; &gt; are not what you think we are from looking at T.V.<br/>
&gt; We are real. We <br/>
&gt; &gt; laugh, we cry. We are serious. We have a sense of<br/>
&gt; humor. You don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; have to be afraid of us. We don&#39;t want to convert<br/>
&gt; you. And please <br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t try to convert us. Just give us the same<br/>
&gt; right we give you--<br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; live in peace. We are much more similar to you<br/>
&gt; than you think.&quot; - <br/>
&gt; &gt; Margot Adler <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sincerely, <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The Undersigned <br/>
