<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189147965">Yep got bad lag in North Ro yeserday while<br/>
camping Dervs. I got disconetced too and could not het on<br/>
until an hour later. Luckely my party was still there.<br/>
We did lose another member and I feel bad about that<br/>
becaus eit was his first time in Ro and on top of that<br/>
he&#39;s a blind human. Hope someone will help him get out<br/>
if he logs back on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also noticed that SK<br/>
are better in a group then I thought. Taunting skill<br/>
is at 65 for me and words quite well most of the<br/>
time and if that doesn&#39;t work I cast dissiease cloud.<br/>
One hell of a taunt.. put&#39;s ya right on top of a<br/>
Mob&#39;s agro list and if hunting several enemies at a<br/>
time it sometimes makes everyone turn on you. But<br/>
having a good healer is absolutly cool in that<br/>
matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Often I would concentrate on the casters while a druid<br/>
whatched my back. And healed me when I got further then to<br/>
bubbles of health down. The others would get the rest and<br/>
I&#39;d join them asap. We rocked again. Having a group<br/>
that knows what it is doing is great. When we got a<br/>
thug we rooted or snard him and had two tanks on him<br/>
and got him down very fast everytime.&lt;br&gt;I love being<br/>
in a good group. But because of the lag and a bummer<br/>
headache I called it a night. To bad because I got very<br/>
good xp on dervs I&#39;m half a bubble from 12. And I want<br/>
my meditate skill!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good hunting all!</div>
