<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505335476">Hehe guess you got em after I loged off. Its back<br/>
to camping guk for me, 50 hrs really sucked but that<br/>
item is worth it hehe ;) took me a looooong time to<br/>
find a group doing the gypsy lute in Mistmoore. It<br/>
even has better stats than mithril. ac20 +5sta +15(i<br/>
think)hp, so I end up with more ac and hp in the end. All<br/>
of the items have good stats and were better than<br/>
what I had before. So it is very very worth it for a<br/>
bard to do these quests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor, 42(back<br/>

rush on the money =P</div>
