<div id="ygrps-yiv-425567319">Yes you could, but it does not always work. If<br/>
the pet has a DOT spell on them, they will<br/>
continuously attack the target. If the target is attacking the<br/>
pet, using /pet back off does almost nothing, since<br/>
the instant the monster hits your pet it&#39;ll start<br/>
attacking again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus, Enchanters cannot send<br/>
commands to their pets at all. Their animations are set to<br/>
permanent &quot;guard&quot; mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s why I went without a<br/>
pet in Cazic Thule<br/>
