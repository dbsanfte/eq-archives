<div id="ygrps-yiv-298270621">Hey im new to EverQuest and really can&#39;t play due<br/>
to some major lag..but since most of u from your<br/>
messages seem like experts let me tell u my<br/>
story..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Outpost.com i ordered EverQuest R.O.K with the<br/>
original and expansion game which is good... for 39.99<br/>
same if u bought the game for 19.99 and the expansion<br/>
the same price(thats what i heard at EB World) but<br/>
anyways...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I downloaded the matches,etc, and well...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If<br/>
you can help i would really be thankful&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)<br/>
When i play what server is dependable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) What<br/>
is a good race i should go with?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) When im<br/>
at the tutorial how come when im talkin to someone<br/>
like a guy who says &quot;im busy leave me alone&quot; how do i<br/>
go away from the conversation so i can continue on<br/>
with the tutorial? cause im starting to aviod all of<br/>
them..*laughs*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Is their a place i can build up EXP. without<br/>
getting hurt badly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Kunark is just lagging<br/>
terribly its takes atleast 4 seconds just to move 1<br/>
step... and well i can admit my com sucks with..only a<br/>
400mhz speed and a really cheap Emachines 3D graphic<br/>
card.. But i can still play without that bad of a lag if<br/>
im on another island right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thanks for<br/>
reading</div>
