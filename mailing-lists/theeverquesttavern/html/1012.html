<div id="ygrps-yiv-97183127">Wow, that was quite an outburst. You know, some<br/>
people do not fully read their manuals, and some forget<br/>
what is in the manuals after reading. I wasn&#39;t meaning<br/>
to be a jackass, I was offering help in a manner I<br/>
saw fit. You did not say whether you had lost your<br/>
manual or not; I thought that maybe you skipped that<br/>
section or just forgot. Instead of flaming me, you could<br/>
have said, &quot;I lost my manual, bro; care to go through<br/>
the steps with me?&quot;</div>
