<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075800807">can anyone tell me where to find the Gnoll Brewers in Black Burrow?<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I think I&#39;ve seen almost the entire place ..but I only <br/>
vaguely remember seeing them in there the 1st trip (and I didn&#39;t know <br/>
where I was going at that time)<br/>
<br/>
Where do they spawn and/or who is the place holder?</div>
