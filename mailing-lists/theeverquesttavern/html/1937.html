<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627494893">Say the &quot;latest news&quot;-- but maybe she&#39;ll change<br/>
her mind on EQ. There&#39;s enough of us gallant white<br/>
knights (even those of us gallant tree huggers) to put a<br/>
fair maiden in the right mood. OR, maybe we&#39;re just a<br/>
bunch of regular guys, some who DO suck, with a bit of<br/>
a &quot;geek streak&quot; in us-- as evident by our need to<br/>
roleplay and post such worthless drivel as this.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW-- I look nothing like my Wood elf &quot;avatar.&quot; Why<br/>
don&#39;t they have a gypsie race? that might produce a<br/>
character I can relate more too-- haha</div>
