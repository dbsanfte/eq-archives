<div id="ygrps-yiv-356336673">Well, I myself spent levels 14 thru 25 in The Warrens for my druid. I <br/>
spent thru 22 with my bard in Oasis. Another spot would be the orcs <br/>
in High Hold Pass and from there moving into High Hold Keep.<br/>
  The orcs in HHP give my 22 bard exp still, and I got 1 full blue <br/>
off the named one with my 27 warrior. He also drops a Sharlok pack <br/>
which is either 6 or 8 slots and 25 percent reduce.<br/>
