<div id="ygrps-yiv-838415912">&quot;As a follow up-- I&#39;ve recently read that Verant<br/>
can not allow us to stack things with charges.<br/>
Therefore, in the near future at least, things like poisons<br/>
and caster spells will not stack. My question is<br/>
then, who are shammys able to stack potions??? Aren&#39;t<br/>
they items with charges???&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s different<br/>
actually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s why... 1) It&#39;s a special thing with Shammy<br/>
potions and only certain potions. 2) It&#39;s not a stack of<br/>
charged items... as far as I understand it-- and here&#39;s<br/>
the fine line&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sow potion that you&#39;re<br/>
thinking of as a &quot;stack&quot; is a 10 charge sow potion created<br/>
using an item called something like a Bear Skin potion<br/>
bag. (forget the exact name. Nice tailored<br/>
item)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fine line I agree. But it&#39;s why you can have say--a<br/>
sword with a right click 5 charge-- but can&#39;t get it to<br/>
stack. Cause well-- it&#39;s a sword. In order for them to<br/>
stack things with charges, swords with charges might<br/>
end up kinda weird. (Just a hunch from what they&#39;ve<br/>
said)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see no reason why they couldn&#39;t just make a vial<br/>
of poison a multi charged item though. Give ya&#39;ll<br/>
like a Poison Bag like the shaman have and make only<br/>
certain poisons combinable (they don&#39;t want you to have<br/>
too much of certain poisons).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... probably it&#39;s a matter of<br/>
man power. They&#39;re working on a lot of stuff since<br/>
SoL came out and if you were to post it on some<br/>
Verant boards-- they might get started on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But<br/>
in order to do that, they&#39;d have to get all the<br/>
poison code-- figure out how they&#39;d like the charge<br/>
additions and tailoring would make a Poison bag, etc etc<br/>
etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saying that they could easily encode doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean a lot of work. Just that the theories and<br/>
concepts and coding will be easy. Nothing new to design.<br/>
Easy work in abundance is still time consuming<br/>
though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS... otherwise though, I hope this clarifies your<br/>
question</div>
