<div id="ygrps-yiv-277171159">Eventhough I quit, I still like to keep up with<br/>
it. Plus, in school right now, I have lots of study<br/>
hall time and little work to do. I have joined many<br/>
clubs to make some friends and pass some time. I joined<br/>
this one because I have much knowledge about EQ. If I<br/>
can help anyone in anyway, I will. I joined this more<br/>
to talk than to learn about the game =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;bob d</div>
