<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489096653">I don&#39;t have an answer, or at least I don&#39;t have<br/>
one you&#39;ll like. I have heard that it is impossible<br/>
to do-- the reason being that people would sell<br/>
their characters more easily, and Verant wants to<br/>
prevent that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had a similar question about<br/>
moving characters to different servers. In a recent<br/>
post, Absor said something like the only way to move a<br/>
charachter to another server is when the servers split.<br/>
Anyone know if this is true?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for accounts, I<br/>
don&#39;t know, but would assume that it wont work. Who<br/>
knows though, e-mail Verant or pettition in the game to<br/>
see if it&#39;s possible!!! I&#39;d love to hear the answer.</div>
