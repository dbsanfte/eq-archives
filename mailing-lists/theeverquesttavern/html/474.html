<div id="ygrps-yiv-756755800">I just joined this club and YES i&#39;m on Xegony.<br/>
I&#39;m a DEL necro and i must say i do love you druids<br/>
wolf spell. A high lvl druid changeg all members of my<br/>
party into wolf form and it was such a trip. As soon as<br/>
the 2 new severs go in I entend to start a druid<br/>
character. I&#39;ve only been playing EQ since X-mass and it has<br/>
totally taken over my life. I haven&#39;t been to the movies<br/>
in a month and i once stayed up and played for 2<br/>
days. My question is does the mania ever stop? I even<br/>
have my Mom who never plays games addicted. We fight<br/>
over the computer. This game has too much power, but<br/>
who am i to complain....It&#39;s so much<br/>
fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Aeday &lt;Dark Legion&gt;&lt;br&gt;lvl 14 DEL Necro&lt;br&gt;Xegony<br/>
Server&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the good die young. The bad prefer it that way.</div>
