<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696905034">I&#39;ve never seen it happen so I can&#39;t say for<br/>
sure. But my guess is that it would be close enough to<br/>
say that one would not dominate the other. Percentage<br/>
rolls would play the biggest factor. One time at it the<br/>
Paladin might win, the next the SK. Who knows for sure?<br/>
Just my two cp.</div>
