<div id="ygrps-yiv-163715758">Faction with Oggok doesn&#39;t matter, except to make<br/>
it easier to get to Clurg, the Ogre bartender. Clurg<br/>
has his own faction. I have found no way of raising<br/>
faction with Clurg other than fulfilling the Stein<br/>
quest....which you can&#39;t do until you have a high enough faction<br/>
with Clurg. Catch 22. Enchanters get around this using<br/>
Alliance/Illusion spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details of the quest can be<br/>
found on other sites. My suggestion would be to get an<br/>
enchanter friend to do the quest for you. The Stein isn&#39;t<br/>
No Drop, so he can give it to you once the quest is<br/>
complete. All the items involved are No Drop (maybe the<br/>
Kiola nut isn&#39;t, not sure). If you wanted to be nice<br/>
and help him, you could kill the Koalindal fish in<br/>
Qeynos for him, but let him loot. The fish is only like<br/>
level 3, but you take a severe faction hit with the<br/>
Qeynos guards for killing it. But I&#39;d personally just<br/>
start a mule character in qeynos, get him to level 3 or<br/>
4, and use him to kill the fish. My brother has a<br/>
level 4 Cleric named Larinchi whose only purpose in<br/>
life is to kill the fish when I need another Stein<br/>
