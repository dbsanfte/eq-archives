<div id="ygrps-yiv-91136980">Hey gang...I too have had a rough time playing a<br/>
non-twinked druid...my first character on EQ. I was able to<br/>
buy some wisdom rings and bracers...but it took all I<br/>
had and then couldn&#39;t buy spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, the next<br/>
time a Druid gives you a SOW...throw a plat his way<br/>
(even 1 plat!)...just know that we are extremely<br/>
grateful! Can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ll run somewhere<br/>
to bind some folks (lvl 30 plusses), just to get a<br/>
few plat so that I can afford to buy spells. But, as<br/>
lvl 29 approaches, I&#39;ll be patient knowing that soon,<br/>
I&#39;ll be able to Transport folks, get a few plat, and<br/>
actually buy something! :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I started an Iksaur Monk<br/>
this past weekend...wow, what fun. I&#39;m level 7,<br/>
totally non-twinked, but having a blast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cojim,<br/>
