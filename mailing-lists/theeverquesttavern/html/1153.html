<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347838328">Cazic-Thule is a great spot. The easiest way is<br/>
through South Ro. Find the southwest wall of South Ro -<br/>
there will be a zone line here. Zone into Feerrott.<br/>
Follow the right wall closely. Stay only on the right<br/>
wall and keep an eye out for a break in the wall. This<br/>
will be the zone in to Innothule. Come forward and<br/>
follow the left wall. You&#39;ll come to a river - swim<br/>
across. Once on the other side, you should see some<br/>
stairs. Invis yourself if you can. Up the stairs is the<br/>
entrance to Cazic-Thule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also good at that level is<br/>
Frontier Mountains in Kunark. A bit hard to describe<br/>
directions - perhaps you could have a friend show you the<br/>
way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51 champion of Prexus</div>
