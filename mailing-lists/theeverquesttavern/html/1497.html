<b>Subject:</b> Re: TWINKING-- a discussion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594092111">Oh, don&#39;t get me started on this. I&#39;ve only been<br/>
playing about 6 weeks, but I already see what twinking<br/>
does to the game, and it annoys me. It&#39;s kind of an<br/>
arrogant thing that no self-respecting DM ever allows in<br/>
pen-and-paper D&D, but that Verant evidently doesn&#39;t have a<br/>
good solution for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t twink, and not just<br/>
because my main character is only 10th level. I hope I<br/>
don&#39;t do it -- I think if I do, it means the game has<br/>
become boring at lower levels, and I should probably<br/>
stop playing. Because that&#39;s really the issue, right<br/>
-- no one wants to go through levels 1-10 again, so<br/>
you twink and power-level to get to the interesting<br/>
stuff. Maybe if Verant made life a bit more exciting for<br/>
&quot;old&quot; noobs somehow, that would reduce the need for<br/>
twinking. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I watched a 5th level Bard dismantle<br/>
the women bandits in Lesser Faydark one night, and<br/>
was totally wowed. I asked to inspect, and discovered<br/>
that EVERY SLOT was filled with a magic item. Cripes,<br/>
I had _one_ -- a suit of Dwarven ring mail that<br/>
someone had pretty much given me (sold it to me for 5 gp<br/>
or something in Freeport) (he wanted 5 pp, but that<br/>
was all I had). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do I like it when someone<br/>
twinks me? Sure, because it&#39;s cool to get magic items,<br/>
but more importantly, because it takes place in the<br/>
context of the game. When the friendly Dwarf sold me the<br/>
ring-mail, another character standing nearby said, &quot;That was<br/>
a really nice thing to do.&quot; And it was. Why&#39;d he do<br/>
it? Glutted market, maybe, but also perhaps because I<br/>
was a role-player. I&#39;ve found that other characters<br/>
(usually high-level) reward that. But that&#39;s another<br/>
discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do we do about it? I&#39;ve wondered if one character<br/>
per server would solve the problem -- that way, you&#39;d<br/>
have to get twinked by other people, at least, and<br/>
that would promote Verant&#39;s goal of encouraging group<br/>
play. I suppose hard-core twinkers would just buy a<br/>
second account, but that would also work to Verant&#39;s<br/>
advantage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thing is, twinkers see nothing wrong with<br/>
the practice (obviously). Go to the class-specific<br/>
Rogue discussion board on Everlore and check out the<br/>
post &quot;How should I twink my little roguie?&quot; Gee, maybe<br/>
the answer is, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dang, gettin&#39;<br/>
long-winded again. I obviously think about this game way too<br/>
much . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;10th season<br/>
