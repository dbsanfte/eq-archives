<b>Subject:</b> Re: TWINKING-- a discussion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-389916382">Thanks for the opinion!! I really think I agree<br/>
with you. I lean more towards no twinking. Here&#39;s a<br/>
kinda similar situation-- as a caster, I was in a group<br/>
that was a few levels higher than me, taking on MOBs<br/>
much higher than me in Unrest. I could NOT hit a damn<br/>
thing with my spells-- constantly resisted. It made me<br/>
pretty much worthless in that group. While I was<br/>
initially angry, i realized that it, in a way, prevented me<br/>
from &quot;experience twinking&quot; -- just like how EQ doesn&#39;t<br/>
let you get experience being in very high groups. I<br/>
wondered if they could do that with armor/weapons. I mean,<br/>
I can&#39;t twink and get lvl 30 spells at lvl 5-- why<br/>
not have a message that says &quot;you are not experienced<br/>
enough to use that&quot; when you try to use<br/>
weapons/armor/itmes that are 5-10 levles beyond you?? Just a<br/>
thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as cross-gender chars-- when I started<br/>
playing EQ, i noticed a lack of female characters running<br/>
around. I thought i&#39;d roll play a little and create a<br/>
female gnome. I love the character and her personality,<br/>
but OY VEY!!! EQ attracts a horny crowd!!! haha<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone else have comments??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-- i love the<br/>
thought of the uber twinker getting run down by a pawn!!!</div>
