<b>Subject:</b> Re: TWINKING-- a discussion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-889251012">Alright... this is something I&#39;ve always been two<br/>
minds about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If someone&#39;s worked hard enough to<br/>
be able to earn such powerful items... I have no<br/>
problems with twinking -- TO a CERTAIN<br/>
degree...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quest creatures that are hard to camp should be<br/>
unreasonable... but there are certain items that are hard to get<br/>
but are common loots for certain mobs. I don&#39;t like<br/>
that idea that ppl would deprive hard to camp mobs<br/>
from others needing it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I have no problem<br/>
if you twink using something that you would have<br/>
just sold anyway for a few extra plat. Maybe even if<br/>
it&#39;s just rare stuff you buy from auction for another<br/>
character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? B/c I&#39;ve benefitted too often from grouping with<br/>
twinked characters. Times when we should have zoned and<br/>
run... we&#39;ve stayed and I&#39;ve healed the tank or what<br/>
not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I myself am not twink and horribly underpowered for<br/>
most level 30 druids. (I don&#39;t have a 200 wis. I get<br/>
soooo ridiculed by almost every party I&#39;ve been in b/c<br/>
of that that I&#39;ve stopped tell ppl my wis at<br/>
times).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic of the Drinal<br/>
Server&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... on the flirting thing. Sigh. I&#39;m guilty. I feel<br/>
bad about that. Ahhh well. At least I haven&#39;t been so<br/>
bad that anyone&#39;s called me on it or not wanted to<br/>
add me to the friends list. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS... as with<br/>
most things in life.. best judgement should be used. A<br/>
code of ethics and respect for other players.<br/>
