<br/>
I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of golf balls. I <br/>
was unhappy with the women&#39;s type I had been using. After browsing <br/>
for several minutes, I was approached by one of the good-looking <br/>
gentlemen who works at the store. He asked if he could help me. <br/>
Without thinking, I looked at him and said, &quot;I think I like playing <br/>
with men&#39;s balls.&quot;<br/>

Nuts about You<br/>
<br/>
My sister and I were at the mall and passed by a store that sold a <br/>
variety of nuts. As we were looking at the display case, the boy <br/>
behind the counter asked if we needed any help. I replied, &quot;No, I&#39;m <br/>
just looking at your nuts.&quot; My sister started to laugh hysterically, <br/>
the boy grinned, and I turned beet-red and walked away. To this day, <br/>
my sister has never let me forget.<br/>

My husband and I took our three kids out shoe shopping one day. We <br/>
were going from store to store, and the kids were getting restless. <br/>
At one crowded store, I was standing near a bench when my 3-year-old <br/>
climbed up on it, grabbed hold of my elastic-waist shorts, and jumped <br/>
off pulling both my shorts and my underwear to the floor. I raced out <br/>
of there, much to the delight of the appreciative onlookers.<br/>

I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three kids in tow and <br/>
asked loudly, &quot;How much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow job?&quot;<br/>

I was taking a shower when my 2-year-old son came into the bathroom <br/>
and wrapped himself in toilet paper. Although he made a mess, he <br/>
looked adorable, so I ran for my camera and took a few shots. They <br/>
came out so well that I had copies made and included one with each of <br/>
our Christmas cards.<br/>
<br/>
Days later, a relative called about the picture, laughing <br/>
hysterically, and suggesting I take a closer look. Puzzled, I stared <br/>
at the photo and was shocked to discover that in addition to my son, <br/>
I had captured my reflection in the mirror - wearing nothing but a <br/>
camera!<br/>

While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to <br/>
release some pent-up energy and ran amok. I was finally able to grab <br/>
hold of her after receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other <br/>
patrons. I told her that if she did not start behaving &quot;right now&quot; <br/>
she would would be punished.<br/>
<br/>
To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a voice just as <br/>
threatening, &quot;If you don&#39;t let me go right now, I will tell Grandma <br/>
that I saw you kissing Daddy&#39;s pee-pee last night!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange. Even the <br/>
tellers stopped what they were doing. I mustered up the last of my <br/>
dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. The last <br/>
thing I heard when the door closed behind me were screams of laughter.<br/>

Surprise!<br/>
<br/>
It was the day before my eighteenth birthday. I was living at home, <br/>
but my parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited my <br/>
girlfriend over for a romantic night alone. As we lay in bed after <br/>
making love, we heard the telephone ring downstairs. I suggested to <br/>
my girlfriend that I give her a piggyback ride to the phone. Since we <br/>
didn&#39;t want to miss the call, we didn&#39;t have time to get dressed. <br/>
When we got to the bottom of the stairs, the lights suddenly came on <br/>
and a whole crowd of people yelled, &quot;SURPRISE!&quot; My entire <br/>
family:aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins and all my friends were <br/>
standing there. My girlfriend and I were frozen in a state of shock <br/>
and embarrassment for what seemed like an eternity. Since then, no <br/>
one in my family has planned a surprise party again.<br/>

One of the funniest &quot;most-embarrassing-moment&quot; stories I&#39;ve come upon <br/>
in a long time was about a lady who picked up several items at a <br/>
discount store. When she finally got up to the checker, she learned <br/>
that one of her items had no price tag. Imagine her embarrassment <br/>
when the checker got on the intercom and boomed out for all the store <br/>
to hear, &quot;PRICE CHECK ON LANE THIRTEEN, TAMPAX, SUPERSIZE.&quot; That was <br/>
bad enough, but somebody at the rear of the store apparently <br/>
misunderstood the word &quot;Tampax&quot; for &quot;THUMBTACKS.&quot; In a business-like <br/>
tone,a voice boomed back over the intercom. &quot;DO YOU MEAN THE KIND YOU <br/>
PUSH IN WITH YOUR THUMB OR THE KIND YOU POUND IN WITH A HAMMER?&quot;<br/>

Mom&#39;s Advice<br/>
<br/>
A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the class was <br/>
squirming around, scratching his crotch and not paying attention. She <br/>
went back to find out what was going on. He was quite embarrassed and <br/>
whispered that he had just recently been circumcised and he was quite <br/>
itchy. The teacher told him to go down to the principal&#39;s office. He <br/>
was to phone his mother and ask her what he should do about it. He <br/>
did it and returned to his class. Suddenly, there was a commotion at <br/>
the back of the room. She went back to investigate only to find him <br/>
sitting at his desk with his penis hanging out. &quot;I thought I told you <br/>
to call your mom.&quot; she screamed. &quot;I did,&quot; he said, &quot;And she told me <br/>
that if I could stick it out till noon, she&#39;d come and pick me up <br/>
from school.&quot;<br/>
