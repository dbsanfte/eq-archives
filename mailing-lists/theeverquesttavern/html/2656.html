<div id="ygrps-yiv-476246542">You&#39;re doomed. <br/>
<br/>
Think of it, you just killed 9 hours of the 10-15 you said you&#39;d <br/>
spend a week!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m laughing just because I did something similar when I started.  <br/>
Eventually you&#39;ll settle into a routine, playing maybe a couple hours <br/>
per night (if you have a real life, that is).  That&#39;s why folks like <br/>
Shooman and me don&#39;t level fast -- if you want to get to the 50s or <br/>
even level 60, it will take many days of playing time.  Here&#39;s a <br/>
kick -- a month or so from now, type /play when you&#39;re in the game <br/>
and see what it says.<br/>
<br/>
The green bar you&#39;re referring to is the connection status bar.  This <br/>
is a description someone gave on the main EQ board:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The green (sometimes yellow, sometimes red) bar with the 4 number <br/>
sets is the lag-o-meter (or lag bar). The leftmost and rightmost <br/>
numbers are your server side and client side ping (meaning how fast <br/>
your connection to the game server is). The middle two numbers are <br/>
packet loss percentages and should stay as close to 0% as possible if <br/>
everything runs fine(90% or more = LD usually).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And here are a couple of glossary links:<br/>

Enjoy.  And remember to go outside occasionally.<br/>

&gt; Thanks for responding to my new to online gaming post<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I picked up the trilogy package, started this afternoon and 9 hours <br/>
&gt; later can see why is referred to as Evercrack.  Started as a wood <br/>
elf <br/>
&gt; ranger.  2 questions:<br/>
&gt; 1. On the main screen middle right is a green bar with a number, a <br/>
&gt; percentage, a second percentage, another number (always changing, <br/>
&gt; what is it ? I couldn&#39;t find it in the manual.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. Also any recommendations on sites/guide for a good EQ lingo <br/>
&gt; glossary.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks Again </span></blockquote></div>
