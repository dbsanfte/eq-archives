<b>Subject:</b> Re: leveling <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-388175913">The best place to level from 1 to 9 would have to<br/>
be misty thicket (halfling newbie zone). I dont<br/>
think there is much to hunt in oot at level 3. You<br/>
should go to west freeport and kill the stuff in the<br/>
newbie zone. I did this with my chanter on vallon zek I<br/>
got through level 1 - 4 in like 2 hours. My chanter<br/>
on vallon zek is untwinked and he did it by killing<br/>
mostly blues. If you kill blues ya just have to kill a<br/>
lot of them. Hope this helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien</div>
