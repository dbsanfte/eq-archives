<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113624826">Well, Im tired of Mistmoore,Ive done the<br/>
GY,Jail&lt; Pit, and cant seem to get a good CourtYard or<br/>
castle group up(too hard to get into &quot;Pick-up groups due<br/>
to usaully not alot of people in the zone, cept<br/>
weekends), PaW has gotten old quik, Rathe Mnts and Hill<br/>
Giant groups are sometimes hard to find and far away<br/>
from a zone.&lt;br&gt; Ive been thinking of heading to<br/>
Kunark(Overthere), but all Ive heard is horror stories on the<br/>
massive Lag. Im on the Tunare server, which is spitting<br/>
this Friday. I(warrior) suck ass at soloing, so thats<br/>
not an option.&lt;br&gt; I just want to get to a place in a<br/>
zone where i can group till lvl 36ish. And then Ill<br/>
hit Guk,Solb, etc.. &lt;br&gt; later Killers,&lt;br&gt;Sollex<br/>
