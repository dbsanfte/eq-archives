<div id="ygrps-yiv-154117137">Just to add a few things about when you become a<br/>
pker. Other non - pk people will not be able to buff<br/>
you while your pk. I found this out one day I didnt<br/>
know what pk really was so I made my level 4 gnome<br/>
necro a pk. Then I was talking to some people and they<br/>
tried to buff me but couldnt so I got rid of my necro.<br/>
In others words if ya want to try pvp do it on a pvp<br/>
server. On non pvp servers its really<br/>
stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien</div>
