<div id="ygrps-yiv-844624121">My take is a little different. When I make a new<br/>
char, I now look for as much of a change as I can. My<br/>
first 2 chars were a wood elf and a gnome, and with<br/>
both I ended up eventually doing the orc hill,<br/>
Crushbone thing-- spent time in BB till everything was<br/>
green, traveled a bit and spent a lot of time in Unrest.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My next chars were an Iksar, then a DE, then an<br/>
Ogre, then a Halfling-- i just needed to get to new<br/>
towns, discover new mobs and fighting areas, new quests,<br/>
etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have never spend much time in the<br/>
Qeynos area or in Erudin, so my next char (when I get<br/>
time to play another-- lol) will most likely be an<br/>
Erudite (good or evil), a barbarian (but only a few class<br/>
choices) or a human in Qeynos. With all the class, race,<br/>
starting location combos, this game is not getting old or<br/>
boring for me yet-- plus, I avoid the<br/>
&quot;standard/recommended&quot; zones for my level. I have not been to LOIO since<br/>
my first char went there to level in the 20s for<br/>
example. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now i convince people to come with me to<br/>
strange places that most people don&#39;t go to (unless<br/>
they&#39;re farming of course), like Runnyeye, the Gorge, EK,<br/>
Steamfont, inside PAW, Lake Rathe, Cazic Thule, Befallen,<br/>
Dagnar&#39;s Cauldron, Permafrost, etc.... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love<br/>
going to new zones, and there are still a lot that i<br/>
haven&#39;t been to. Remember the rush you felt when you<br/>
entered your first EQ dungeon? Head to Kunark and jump<br/>
into the Crypt of Dalnir, Kaesora, The Mines of Nurga,<br/>
etc. Just have an evac ready!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela<br/>

Spelunker&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-- I&#39;m not nocking your choice at all, just sharing<br/>
my thoughts. Never played a half-elf, but maybe i&#39;ll<br/>
try one in Qeynos next. My very first char in EQ was<br/>
a half-elf ranger in Surefall. I kept getting lost,<br/>
thought that was a bad omen as a ranger, and deleted him<br/>
at level 3.</div>
