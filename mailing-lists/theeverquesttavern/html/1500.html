<div id="ygrps-yiv-523622917">I like that idea of &quot;You are not experienced<br/>
enough to use that item.&quot; It might be hard to implement,<br/>
however, as with that Dwarven ring mail. I was something<br/>
like 3rd level at the time, and there&#39;s only one place<br/>
to get it, if I&#39;m not mistaken -- Emperor Crush in<br/>
Crushbone. He&#39;s about 20th level, I think, so there&#39;s no way<br/>
I was going to get that on my own. But if someone<br/>
wants to give it to me, why prevent that? That&#39;s one of<br/>
the cool parts of EQ -- the community. I was<br/>
completely blown away for my first week at how nice people<br/>
were in the game; one Dwarf gave me 7 pp to outfit<br/>
myself. Yow! (Now that I think of it, when I lost that<br/>
armor, some halfling gave me a Snakeskin Jerkin; kind of<br/>
a cool thing. Why do people keep giving me<br/>
stuff?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it would prevent same-account twinking, so maybe<br/>
that would just be the price to pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shooman in<br/>
a later post makes a point I guess I could accept<br/>
-- if you&#39;re not going to use something anyway, why<br/>
not give it to one of your other characters? I&#39;ve<br/>
thought of that when I get a 2H weapon that my Rogue<br/>
can&#39;t use, but I&#39;m going to try not to do it.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;EQ attracts a horny crowd&quot; -- ? Well, yah -- most of<br/>
us _are_ computer geeks, you know. The study I<br/>
mentioned in an earlier post found that, apart from the<br/>
largest group of players (students, 30-odd percent), the<br/>
next largest group came from the technical/computer<br/>
field (something like 27%). Sheesh, one guy even tried<br/>
to hit on my female Troll Shadow Knight -- said to<br/>
be careful and not to mess up my &quot;purdy&quot; face . .<br/>
.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, time to go to Norrath. Good hunting to all of<br/>
you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;10th season Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
