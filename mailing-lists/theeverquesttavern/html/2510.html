<b>Subject:</b> Will my account still be good? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-360670427">Ok another question? Since I have not played in<br/>
some time, will my account still be good? By that I<br/>
mean will my char still be available to me when I do<br/>
get around to playing again? I know that I will<br/>
always have an account so long as I have a valid c/c and<br/>
my cd codes, but will my characters still be there<br/>
if I have not played them in some time? I don&#39;t<br/>
think I would be too upset if I have to make new<br/>
characters &#39;cause it&#39;s always fun starting from scratch.<br/>
*grimaces* But if I have to, well then I guess I have to.<br/>
....hhhmmm reminds me of another question? What&#39;s a good<br/>
server to be on? I was on E&#39;ci with some friends (the<br/>
ones who twisted my arm to get me to play EQ in the<br/>
first place!) but they have stopped playing so I am<br/>
thinking of changing servers. Thanks for letting me ramble<br/>
a bit. The Raven</div>
