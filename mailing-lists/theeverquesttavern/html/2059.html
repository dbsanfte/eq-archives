<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-347897894">Hottest selling items. That depends on what you<br/>
mean. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And typically Tailored backpacks on<br/>
Drinal sell for 75 to 125 plat. I wouldn&#39;t pay more than<br/>
85 plat probably though. I don&#39;t even have that<br/>
kinda dough after spell shopping though (took me over<br/>
225 plat to buy almost all my 39 spells).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hot<br/>
items are usually things like Fungi Tunics, FBSS, Yaks<br/>
and Waks. (although I&#39;m not sure that Waks are really<br/>
what ppl call them. I just do).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For low level<br/>
loot. Yep. Bone chips are decent, and so are CB belts.<br/>
Used to sell a few and then go in and turn in the rest<br/>
of mine for the quest. The exp and the item you get<br/>
for that quest more than made up for the run from CB<br/>
to Kaladim and back again. Made a lot of low level<br/>
plat for spells that way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... I wasn&#39;t sure what to write here. I just typed in<br/>
some general info. Hope it helped or answered the<br/>
question. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatehue Prismatic</div>
