<b>Subject:</b> Tribunal Mage Guild <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864678413">I was just wondering on the status of the proposed mage guild on <br/>
the tribunal server.  I started a DE mage and was wondering if i was <br/>
wasting my time in playing him, as my main and all my alts are <br/>
currently on Rodcet Nife.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                                      Hoping for feedback,<br/>
                                       Magicide (Tribunal)</div>
