<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320223421">I remember when I first heard of everquest, it<br/>
was back in washington, (State) I was looking in the<br/>
comp. usa add paper, I saw something called &quot;Everquest&quot;<br/>
So I decided to check it out, when I got there I<br/>
though it was just another game, or chat, ya know, I&#39;m<br/>
crazy about chats, but I was wrong, I think I went to a<br/>
computer which told you about the programs and I selected<br/>
EverQuest, it showed me a mini movie and I immediately<br/>
wanted that, I started reading the Faq about it, I<br/>
didn&#39;t finish it of course, and in summer I was<br/>
mensioning EverQuest all the time, it was about august, so<br/>
my mom said to wait &#39;till christmas, I never talked<br/>
about it, I just kept on doing my thing, Oddworld, Grim<br/>
Fandango, Chat, etc. I started realizing its kinda close<br/>
(Few months away) &#39;till Christmas and I wrote on my<br/>
calender the days &#39;till christmas, aproximatly today its<br/>
88 day&#39;s &#39;till it, I wrote some wish lists, at the<br/>
top was EverQuest & a 3D card, and below were other<br/>
stuff I could live without (I can live without<br/>
everquest but what would I do??????????) I&#39;m a computer<br/>
geek, I love the computer, I try to stay on as long as<br/>
I can, ya know, last week I was sooooooooooo<br/>
restless, staying up &#39;till 11:00 at night, just bulding<br/>
stuff with legos, I&#39;ve already chosen which races I<br/>
probaly want to be (Halfling, DarkElf, HighElf) I know<br/>
you can have 8. And I&#39;ve chosen the names for them<br/>
(Petit, Dimness, Xyla) I even built little lego statues<br/>
of them, lol, so I really have gone completely mad<br/>
about everquest, Ever since it came out I&#39;ve wanted it,<br/>
I promised my mom & dad that I will pay for the<br/>
monthly fees (atleast the first one is FREE) which is<br/>
9.89 per month? which I get 20.00 a month from my<br/>
chores :) and so I&#39;m just sitting here... In front of my<br/>
computer, Programming, Chatting,<br/>
whatever.&lt;br&gt;:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--Destino88</div>
