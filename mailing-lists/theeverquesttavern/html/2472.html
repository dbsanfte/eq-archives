<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627761282">&quot;Good thing about Goons, they only leave the<br/>
compound at night. &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You sure about that? I could<br/>
have sworn I&#39;ve seen them around before that time.<br/>
Course I&#39;m guessing that someone might have pulled it<br/>
out of the compound in the day. Cause when it<br/>
happened the couple of times, I could have sworn for sure<br/>
they were shouting they were gonna give 2k plat to<br/>
whomever would go there and hand the mob a plat and get<br/>
away as long as they were under level 35 and a good<br/>
race. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.. I thought it was<br/>
a mean trick b/c they would only give the reward in<br/>
Copper but didn&#39;t mention that outright.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Course<br/>
it was an impossible task anyway.</div>
