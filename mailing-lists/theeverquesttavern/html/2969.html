<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394591682">Duels are really based on player skill. It&#39;s tough to say who would <br/>
win if two really good veterans go at it. A shaman can debuff, slow, <br/>
and completely cripple a Necro pet easy, while the Necro itself can <br/>
immediately begin fearing, DoTing the shaman or the pet. Plenty of <br/>
tactics here.<br/>

&gt; thats minus hp for you , plus hp for her<br/>
&gt; if she has done her research , i believe she can root too<br/>
