<b>Subject:</b> Gone too long: A reintroduction <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355094002">Holy Crap!&lt;br&gt;So I&#39;m thinking today, ya know, I<br/>
haven&#39;t visited this EQ club I joined waaayyyyyy back,<br/>
let&#39;s pop in and take a look. There&#39;s more than 600<br/>
members here! Awesome! Last time I was here I think there<br/>
were maybe 50. LOL&lt;br&gt;Anyway, a reintroduction is<br/>
probably in order.&lt;br&gt;I play on the Tunare server (left<br/>
Mith Marr more than a year ago to play w/ some RL<br/>
friends.) My main chars are:&lt;br&gt;Moradin - 32 Dwarven<br/>
Paladin&lt;br&gt;Semuanya - 22 Iksar Monk&lt;br&gt;Llolth - 20 Dark Elf Shadow<br/>
Knight and proud member of &lt;The<br/>
Sisterhood&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teidra - 17 Barbarian Warrior and also &lt;The<br/>
Sisterhood&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gruumsh - 14 Ogre Shaman and proud member of &lt;The<br/>
Reverends of Turmoil&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Re-Hiyas to all the old<br/>
members, and HELLO! to all the new. I look forward to<br/>
getting to know you all in game and on the board<br/>
here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timosan</div>
