<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157480371">I left EQ a While back, I am debating wether or<br/>
no&lt;br&gt;to return. (since I am stuck in B.F.E. I might since<br/>
I have no one eles to play 3e d&d wit.)&lt;br&gt;anywho,<br/>
it seems that the evergestapo have done &lt;br&gt;the<br/>
impossible.&lt;br&gt;1) no one and I mean NO ONE dares to sell any&lt;br&gt; eq<br/>
plat, items or characters.&lt;br&gt;2) searching the web for<br/>
cheat sites, results in&lt;br&gt;a day wasted pulling up dead<br/>
links (*and I mean DEAD!*).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the evergestapo have<br/>
it in for the cheaters out there, damn shame<br/>
is...&lt;br&gt;I am a cheater. I did buy extra platinum when &lt;br&gt;I<br/>
was playing and used it to aid newbies and &lt;br&gt;master<br/>
my craft skills. &lt;br&gt;yes, I am a perpitrator of the<br/>
greatest evil that the game has ever known.&lt;br&gt;I like to<br/>
give new rangers,bards,druids, 35 plat total in store<br/>
bought leather, a shield and a decent NON RUSTY<br/>
scimitar.&lt;br&gt;I am guilty,&lt;br&gt;I ask to be punished for my<br/>
crimes.&lt;br&gt;signed,&lt;br&gt;psyker</div>
