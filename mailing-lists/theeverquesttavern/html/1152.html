<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726769560">Wisdom and AC will be your two most important<br/>
statistics as a shaman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some different<br/>
theories on this, but as a shaman you&#39;ll later be casting<br/>
spells that have high aggro value - mobs will often<br/>
times beat on you a lot. You will want lots of AC for<br/>
this. Base agility raises your AC more than agility<br/>
raised later by spell buffs or item buffs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also,<br/>
wisdom is your spell casting power. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll<br/>
be able to put all 30 points into wisdom, but put a<br/>
lot in there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, you&#39;ll get<br/>
statistical buffs, so keeping your stats high will never be a<br/>
problem, as long as you have mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51<br/>
