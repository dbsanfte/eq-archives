<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940403072">Lesser Succor is also available in Surefall Glade of the merchant <br/>
Sallah. I guess they need to get a better inspiration for names. <br/>
Sure, an extra l might fool some folks, but I guess we can thank <br/>
Karana that she wasn&#39;t named Edalg Llaferus. Hmmm, I might want to <br/>
try that name. hehehehe<br/>

&gt; &gt; patch) be bought anywhere besides Luclin?  I only have the old <br/>

&gt; &gt; him get it for me.<br/>
