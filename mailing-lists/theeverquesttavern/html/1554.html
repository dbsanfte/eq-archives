<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574986633">My sub-characters have items above their means,<br/>
but my Cleric lived the hard life just like everyone<br/>
on their first character. Some of my Twink items<br/>
were gifts from other players and some were crafted by<br/>
my Cleric who had taken up and mastered several<br/>
trade skills. Every level I max their skills and most<br/>
zones they hunt, my cleric has done time in, so I know<br/>
what to expect. I give items out and craft items for<br/>
people. To me, it&#39;s a personal choice, if you don&#39;t want<br/>
to twink, that&#39;s fine. If you do, fine, what matters<br/>
more is how you play. Personally, I&#39;d rather see<br/>
someone wearing something they earned even through<br/>
another character then to hear the shouts from beggars.<br/>
Bottom Line.....it&#39;s your $10 you pay every month for<br/>
your account - you pay for your cable or ISP, play how<br/>
you want.</div>
