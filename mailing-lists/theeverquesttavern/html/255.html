<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692822610">I was recently told by my good friend Kaylin<br/>
Danmor that Green Splinted Armor no longer existed. I<br/>
don&#39;t mean to argue the point, but I want to make sure<br/>
because I always dreamed of marching around in a suit of<br/>
green plate in a Ranger fashion. If anyone knows<br/>
whether this rare armor exists at all or if it is simply<br/>
near impossible to find, please let me know. If Green<br/>
Splinted does not exist, then is there any other armor<br/>
that shows up as green plate that a ranger can<br/>
wear?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trellan Hawksight, Wood Elf Ranger of 20 seasons.</div>
