<div id="ygrps-yiv-973108888">Well it does not look like there is a tremendous<br/>
bunch of people here at this time either, but it does<br/>
look like the group is a bunch of well seasoned<br/>
Norrathians. I myself am not of a high level, but I have had<br/>
many characters in their teens. (though I keep getting<br/>
bored and wanna try a new class and eventually delete<br/>
them all). If anyone here wants to know some good PK<br/>
tactics...I am not a pker usually, but I know some good<br/>
pkers, and I have some excellent Rogue and Druid tactics<br/>
myself (I am from VZ)&lt;br&gt; Thankyou for the advice offer</div>
