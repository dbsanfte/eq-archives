<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832740765">WE MADE IT!!<br/>
<br/>
According to today&#39;s regulators and bureaucrats, those of us who were <br/>
kids in the 40&#39;s, 50&#39;s, 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s or  even the early 80&#39;s, probably  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have survived.<br/>
<br/>
Our baby cribs were covered with bright colored lead-based paint. And <br/>
we chewed on them.<br/>
<br/>
We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets, and <br/>
when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets. (Not to mention the risks <br/>
we took hitchhiking.)<br/>
<br/>
As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags.<br/>
<br/>
Riding in the back of a pickup truck on a warm day was always a <br/>
special treat.<br/>
<br/>
We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle. Horrors!<br/>
<br/>
We ate cupcakes, bread and butter, and drank soda pop with sugar in <br/>
it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside <br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle, and no <br/>
one actually died from this.<br/>
<br/>
We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then <br/>
rode down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After <br/>
running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we <br/>
were back when the streetlights came on.<br/>
<br/>
No one was able to reach us all day. No cell phones. Unthinkable! <br/>
<br/>
We did not have Play Station, Nintendo 64, X-Boxes, no video games at <br/>
all, no 99 channels on  cable, videotape movies, surround sound, <br/>
personal cell phones, personal computers, or Internet chat rooms.<br/>
<br/>
We had friends! We went outside and found them.<br/>
<br/>
We played dodge ball, and sometimes, the ball would really hurt.<br/>
<br/>
We fell out of trees, got cut and broke bones and teeth, and there <br/>
were no lawsuits from these accidents. They were accidents. No one <br/>
was to blame but us. Remember accidents?<br/>
<br/>
We had fights and punched each other and got black and blue and <br/>
learned to get over it, and all it took was an &quot;I&#39;m Sorry&quot; to make it <br/>
all better.<br/>
<br/>
We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and ate worms, and <br/>
although we were told it would happen, we did not put out very many <br/>
eyes, nor did the worms live inside us forever.<br/>
<br/>
We rode bikes or walked to a friend&#39;s home and knocked on the door, <br/>
or rang the bell or just walked in and talked to them.<br/>
<br/>
Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who <br/>
didn&#39;t had to learn to deal with disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
Some students weren&#39;t as smart as others, so they failed a grade and <br/>
were held back to repeat the same grade. Horrors! Tests were not <br/>
adjusted for any reason.<br/>
<br/>
Our actions were our own. Consequences were expected, no one to hide <br/>
behind.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. <br/>
They actually sided with the law. Imagine that!<br/>
<br/>
This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem <br/>
solvers and inventors, ever.<br/>
<br/>
The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. <br/>
We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned <br/>
how to deal with it all.<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re one of them. Congratulations!<br/>
<br/>
Please pass this on to others who have had the luck to grow up as <br/>
kids, before lawyers and government regulated our lives, for our own <br/>
good.<br/>

&quot;Before we can break free from what binds us we must first realize we <br/>
are locked up&quot;.<br/>
