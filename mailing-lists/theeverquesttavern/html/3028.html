<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542549414">Hello Smurfyc,<br/>
<br/>
 My name is Leo, better known as Qbano Boofmiester on<br/>
EQ&#39;s server Druzzil Ro. First start with EQ Gold<br/>
Edition it comes with all the expansions except Legacy<br/>
of the Ykesha. If your pc needs more ram do so prior<br/>
to starting eq. Its has a minimum of 256 mb ram, but<br/>
if you want all the options 512 or higher is more like<br/>
it, also a good video card is needed. Such as Nvidia<br/>
or ATI cards, with at least 32 mb of ram. Though you<br/>
can use EQ with dial-up. It will be extremely laggy. I<br/>
suggest using dsl or cable connections. And when you<br/>
choose a server,if you go with  the one Im on. I can<br/>
help you with the basics. And give you the basic<br/>
beginner&#39;s armor and weapons. Nothing fancy of course<br/>
but just something to get you started. Welcome to our<br/>
world. And I hope to be hearing from you soon. <br/>
