<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759469463">The /con guide really comes in handy. My friend<br/>
has that guide book, and it helps out alot in finding<br/>
good kills for good exp. While tarvelling around in<br/>
the pit in the Field of Bone on Kunark, I looked back<br/>
on the /con guide to help pick out those better of<br/>
the blue scalebone skeletons. Still I&#39;d rather take<br/>
the risk and fight white&#39;s or even yellow&#39;s. So far,<br/>
using the /con guide, I&#39;ve filled 3 bubbles in around 2<br/>
hours, which I&#39;d say isn&#39;t too shabby. I DID start a new<br/>
character and get him to level 9 in around a week.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of griffs. I started a Dark Elf a while back and<br/>
wanted to start my levelling in Freeport, and on my way<br/>
blocking the trail was a griffon. I couldn&#39;t go around,<br/>
since there were higher level orc&#39;s scouting the place,<br/>
so I just thought, what the hell, and darted<br/>
through. I guess them griff&#39;s like me because it just kept<br/>
hovering in that same spot and never spotted me.<br/>
Unfortunately, the guy behind me wasn&#39;t as<br/>
lucky....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xythe of the 9th Level&lt;br&gt;Iksar Shadow<br/>
