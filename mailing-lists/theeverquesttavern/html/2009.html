<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561935516">I think it depends, If your just starting out<br/>
then I would stay there in the local area. You can get<br/>
1-4 pretty quickly there outside killin bats & bees<br/>
at lvl 1-2 At three u might be able to kill the<br/>
wolves & the skellys & by 4 your takin on the orc pawns.<br/>
Once youve gotten there I would say try your hand at<br/>
the orc lift for some fast xp or go to BB & go for<br/>
the snakes & skunks.&lt;br&gt; The point is, there is<br/>
plenty to kill in your local area~ Im a lvl 8 almost 9 &<br/>
I still havent gone to another continent. Id say<br/>
its pretty safe around my lvl though, but Im not<br/>
taking n e chances till theres nothing left for me to<br/>
gain xp on in the local area&lt;br&gt; Hope I was some help~<br/>
should have added chapters after this novel</div>
