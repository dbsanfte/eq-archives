<div id="ygrps-yiv-490836214">Figured, I noticed those that posted stories and<br/>
I shall post an interesting story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is<br/>
not one about such grand ol&#39; things such as ye of the<br/>
large and grandeous cities might tell. There are no<br/>
dragons, or demons. No grand monsters, and no evils<br/>
slain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yea, this is a tale of laughter and embarrassment for<br/>
such as I. I, known as Fatedhue, Wood Elf Druid<br/>
resident of Kelethin. He of the 4th ranking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was<br/>
travelling through the forest stopping the foulness of<br/>
Tricksters and Pawns. I was also harvesting the natural<br/>
bounty of the forest when I passed a maiden most passing<br/>
fair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was something I oft wondered at and I told the<br/>
lady... &quot;Indeed, tis quite a wonder at the art of this<br/>
world that generates such beauty as that of the wood<br/>
elf female!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oddly enough, this said female<br/>
bedecked o&#39; her self in leather asked me, &quot;And of High<br/>
Elves?&quot; I answered her, &quot;Yea, laddie. High Elves are fair<br/>
but only passing fair compared to the beauty existant<br/>
in Wood Elves. For what can compare to beauty forged<br/>
in nature. High elves be of lofty buildings, where<br/>
we be of lofty arbols.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I passed on my way,<br/>
continuing in my chores for personal inroads-- as well as<br/>
assisting those of the Tunare Rangers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later that<br/>
night, faine did I pass said lady again, and I peered<br/>
more than passing glance this time. Alas my<br/>
embarrassment!!! I noted her more closely as HIGH elf... and not a<br/>
laddie of my fair arbols. She was a LADY of<br/>
Felwithe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I apologized to the lady for my comments. I<br/>
profusely apologized for my drool-- I&#39;d fallen from the<br/>
heights of Kelethin once too much. Tis&#39; indeed more<br/>
embarrassing to insult a laddie or lady, than to fall in<br/>
drunken stupor to the floor of Kelethin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yea,<br/>
indeed. That is my tale for those around. I am a humble<br/>
storyteller-- of no match for those Minstrels of Norath. I<br/>
thank all for listening to my humble tales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fare<br/>
all well,&lt;br&gt;FatedHue, Druid of the 4th, Resident of<br/>
Kelethin, He of Drinal.</div>
