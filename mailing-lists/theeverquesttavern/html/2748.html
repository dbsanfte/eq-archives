<div id="ygrps-yiv-5716513">Hello Fellow Norrathians,<br/>
<br/>
 I am a Barbarian Shaman, on the Druzzil Ro server in my 21st season. <br/>
Im currently looking to buy WIS gear for me. Ive started to use this <br/>
server as healers and casters only. Id like to buy wis gear that can <br/>
get me up to level 50 ish or so. Even though you arent on the server <br/>
Im on. The name and stats of the items that you own or have owned <br/>
plus the estimated value of said items, would prove very helpfull. If <br/>
thou art on my server, send me a tell, to the name of Odraneol. I <br/>
also have yet to apply a surname to myself. please help in my search. <br/>
and ill always pay it forward with the newbies on my server. Im <br/>
usually bound in Greater Faydark, and I hunt in Unrest. And will <br/>
continue to do so until, i ding 30 and get my pet. please remember <br/>
this, live long and prosper.     <br/>

&gt; Hail,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been at this stoopid game for close to 3 years. My crowning <br/>
&gt; achievement so far (150 days played, cause I love to &#39;smell the <br/>
&gt; flowers&#39;) is lvl 60 epiced shaman with complete spellbook<br/>
&gt; (no &#39;Ancient Scrolls&#39; yet) and 25 AA pts. Even after playing EQ for <br/>
&gt; this amount of time there is so much I am unfamiliar with, mostly <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; old world, feel like newbie often :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do however have humble knowledge of the Barbarian Shaman class, <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; continent of Antonica and many of the kunark and velious zones. I <br/>
&gt; hang out mostly in luclin zones atm. I belong to a smallish guild <br/>
(60 <br/>
&gt; members) that I have been in for 2 years (since early 30&#39;s) we are <br/>
&gt; just now approaching some of the higher end encounters.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know I will learn from you folks and hopefully be able to <br/>
&gt; contribute in some humble manner.<br/>
