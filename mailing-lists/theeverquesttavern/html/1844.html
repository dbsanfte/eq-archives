<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574100995">That&#39;s my biggest gripe about EQ so far. I don&#39;t<br/>
really care so much that Verant nerfs things<br/>
unnecessarily, touting that they gave players too much of an<br/>
advantage, as if they don&#39;t need it against NPCs that punch<br/>
for ungodly amounts, have infinite mana pools, can<br/>
cast 200+ dd spells in half a sec without being<br/>
interrupted by constant hits and movements... well, you get<br/>
the idea.&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t really care so much about the<br/>
ridiculous prices people want to demand for items that are<br/>
high level and only used to twink with. Things that<br/>
aren&#39;t necessary to develop a character as there are 60s<br/>
out there that have never had such items in their<br/>
young lives on through middle age.&lt;br&gt;No... my problem<br/>
that drives me from EQ mostly is the manners problem.<br/>
So many rude people, so many &quot;bastards&quot; out there.<br/>
They think &quot;Well, I can do whatever I want, it&#39;s just<br/>
a game, screw them if they don&#39;t like how I<br/>
behave.&quot; It&#39;s stupid. I mean, most of these people don&#39;t<br/>
understand that just because you pay to play doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
you must be an ass to others. *forgive my language,<br/>
but I feel strongly about this*&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t pay my<br/>
monthly fee to play just to come on and watch people<br/>
scream at each other over OOC, beg me for things in<br/>
tells, hail me repeatedly and inspect me without asking<br/>
*especially if I&#39;m fighting a mob!*, and get mad when I don&#39;t<br/>
sow them immediately when I&#39;m out of mana. People in<br/>
EQ... well, actually, people in the real world as well,<br/>
all need to remember what the things called manners<br/>
are. There is a total lack of respect for each other<br/>
running rampant in the world and it&#39;s all because of my<br/>
generation that grew up spoiled brats because of previous<br/>
generations giving us everything and reading things like Dr.<br/>
Spock and taking good advice overboard. C&#39;mon people...<br/>
just because everything has been given to a lot of us<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean we need to treat everyone around us like<br/>
total jerks because we&#39;re cocky about everything.&lt;br&gt;Do<br/>
I refuse to help someone that&#39;s been an ass to me?<br/>
No... I still help them out if I can. They don&#39;t walk<br/>
on me, I just refuse to be on their level and be a<br/>
jerk because I was given a bad turn. I still sow the<br/>
angry bastard. I still heal those that are dying,<br/>
whether they&#39;ve been annoying or not. If they&#39;re mature<br/>
individuals, they&#39;ll realize it was given freely and not<br/>
because they bitched and whined, but because a good<br/>
person was behind that pixel on their screen.&lt;br&gt;And<br/>
maybe eventually they&#39;ll get it through their head that<br/>
not everyone is a jerk like them and they&#39;ll start<br/>
doing others good turns.&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s stupid to think that,<br/>
I know... but hey... at least it makes me special<br/>
and different from everyone else. It doesn&#39;t mean I<br/>
have to talk to them. It doesn&#39;t mean I have to cater<br/>
to them. I give them the whatever anyway (being a<br/>
35th level shaman, you can give a lot), and then just<br/>
be on my way and forget they exist. Odds are, with<br/>
how much I move around, I&#39;ll never see them again<br/>
anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the fact remains... I&#39;m sick of the assholes. I<br/>
come on EQ to get away from people like that. And then<br/>
I run into more there? That&#39;s no fun. I usually<br/>
have OOC and Shout turned off... Auction is<br/>
perpetually off due to being sickened by prices in<br/>
general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Kalranis Darkholme&lt;br&gt;18th Cleric, Brell Serilis<br/>
