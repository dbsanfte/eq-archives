<div id="ygrps-yiv-903268663">I think what happened is that there was a site called &quot;Groups.com.&quot;  <br/>
That got eaten by Google, which then sold the groups to Yahoo, which <br/>
had &quot;clubs.&quot;  So now they&#39;re merging everything under Groups.  Maybe <br/>
they&#39;ll fix that little date-stamp problem they have every once in a <br/>
while.</div>
