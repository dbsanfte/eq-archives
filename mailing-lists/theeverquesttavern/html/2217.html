<div id="ygrps-yiv-754419656">OK, I got the Everquest and am thnking of a Half<br/>
Elf character, either a Druid, Ranger or Paladin.<br/>
Which would be the best starting city for each, or does<br/>
it make a difference? Also, I am looking for<br/>
feedback on different servers. I do not want PvP, so I<br/>
know which ones to not start with; someone on Bertox<br/>
(I think) was awfully nice to me, but does that mean<br/>
I would have to be a follower of the evil god it is<br/>
based on? And I understand that Fennin Ro was te first<br/>
&quot;role playing server, but I thought the whole EQ game<br/>
was roleplaying? I would not mind the servers where a<br/>
lot of German players play.Ionly know enough German<br/>
to get myself into (but not out of) trouble, but I<br/>
am certainly not intimidated by it. Any thoughts<br/>
would be appreciated.</div>
