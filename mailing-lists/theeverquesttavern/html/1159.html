<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492862801">To train your dodge, keep fighting. It maxxes out<br/>
at every level and doesn;t increase until you hit a<br/>
new level.&lt;br&gt;Suggestion. Make sure you put a point<br/>
in all of your skills. Easy to do. Start of with<br/>
1HB, 2HB, 2HS, 1HS, Dodge, Pierce, Offense, Defense,<br/>
etc etc. Make sure when you go to train at your<br/>
guildmaster to put one point in the skills you want. It is<br/>
really hard to train low level skills once you get<br/>
higher in levels. Do it now. Ask anyone in game about<br/>
putting a point in a skill and they will explain it to<br/>
you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pist&lt;br&gt;Warrior of the 29th Year.&lt;br&gt;Quellious/Norrath Foreign<br/>
