<b>Subject:</b> Re: Twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-651005846">I suspect I&#39;m going to regret this, given what<br/>
I&#39;ve said about twinking in earlier discussions here<br/>
and in other places. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recently re-activated<br/>
a character I created way back when I started, a<br/>
Wood-Elf Female Warrior (go ahead, snicker). Wanted to see<br/>
life from the front side of the MOb, since my Rogue is<br/>
always looking up its butt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I chose to do<br/>
was this: Since my Rogue occasionally works on<br/>
poisons, he needs lots of low-level items. Wasp venom<br/>
sacs, spider poison gland, pixie dust. So, instead of<br/>
outright twinking, I chose to have the two of them engage<br/>
in trade -- poison supplies for FS weapons,<br/>
basically. The Wood Elf also did a pottery-supply run, since<br/>
the medium bowl sketches I needed are not available<br/>
in Kaladim. The Rogue gave her a bunch of plat,<br/>
said, &quot;Keep the change,&quot; and sent her off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One<br/>
thing I did notice, however. I have a third character<br/>
in the area, a female Dwarf Paladin, that was also<br/>
created in my first week of playing. Have never done much<br/>
with her, and don&#39;t intend to, but since I have a LOT<br/>
of Small Scarab Breastplates laying around (I<br/>
literally have a backpack of them in the bank), I decided<br/>
to give her one of those and a FS mace, more or less<br/>
to hold on to. (Bank mule, I guess you call it.)<br/>
When I was moving her to the bank through the mine in<br/>
Kaladim, I ran across a Giant Rat. So, I figured what the<br/>
hey, and attacked it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It died in three swings,<br/>
and never touched me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My Rogue died fighting<br/>
these things by himself at 4th level, I think. Yow, now<br/>
I see why people twink. You&#39;re invincible. It&#39;s<br/>
like being uber without having all the levels.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, yes, I guess I&#39;ve twinked now. But I will always<br/>
try to do it in roleplay -- engaging in trade, for<br/>
example, or rendering other services. Right now, my Rogue<br/>
is in Cazic-Thule, for example, near my 4th level<br/>
Troll Shadow Knight. I&#39;m very encumbered after hunting,<br/>
so I&#39;m thinking of giving stuff to her to take into<br/>
Grobb to sell. That saves me a trip to Freeport, and<br/>
she can keep the silver and copper, for example.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(But why are all of the alts that I actually play<br/>
females? That&#39;s a different question.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
Kaladim&lt;br&gt;Rogue of 25 seasons&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uenlaenae&lt;br&gt;Warrioress of 7<br/>
Rains of Karana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nazbeku&lt;br&gt;Minion of Cazic-Thule<br/>
of the 4th Fear&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Khinusht&lt;br&gt;1st level Paladin<br/>
of Brell&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(aka, Kharlisht and his<br/>
women)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(And, yes, I am the king of long posts)</div>
