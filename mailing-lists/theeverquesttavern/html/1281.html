<div id="ygrps-yiv-716840490">Okay, I&#39;m sure some of you out there know of, or<br/>
have done this quest.. but I will post it for those<br/>
out there who don&#39;t. I haven&#39;t contributed much<br/>
thusfar, so I figured I might as well<br/>
start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Testament of Vanear&lt;br&gt;Secondary Slot Item&lt;br&gt;+10<br/>
WIS&lt;br&gt;+10 Mana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go to Moodoro Findharn in Qeynos<br/>
(he&#39;s in Crow&#39;s Tavern in North Qeynos)&lt;br&gt;Give him 2<br/>
gold. He should give you an empty testament of vanear.<br/>
This is good.&lt;br&gt;Give him 4 gold, he&#39;ll give you a<br/>
card (either a queen, king, jester, or something<br/>
else). If it is a jester, give it to him and receive a<br/>
page. If it is one of the other cards, destroy it and<br/>
give him another 4 gold until you get the jester. This<br/>
is half of the pages, place it in the testament and<br/>
hike it to highhold pass.&lt;br&gt;When you arrive in<br/>
highhold pass, find the tavern that is surrounded by<br/>
water, I forget the name.. sorry. Hop in the water,<br/>
there is a hole in the wall under a bridge, swim<br/>
through it. You should arrive in an area surrounded by<br/>
smugglers. They were apprehensive to my druid (at the time<br/>
lvl 24) and some conned red and some green, so be<br/>
safe and don&#39;t attack any of them. Travel farther into<br/>
the smugglers area and you&#39;ll come upon an area with<br/>
a pottery wheel and a kiln or oven. This is where<br/>
Dyllin Starshine (aka your target) spawns. He is<br/>
approximately an 8 hour spawn, so you either have to be lucky<br/>
or patient to get him. He conned green to me at lvl<br/>
24 and was easily dropped with about 200 points of<br/>
damage, perhaps less. Loot his body for a page and an<br/>
envelope. The page goes in the testament with the other<br/>
page, hit combine on the book and voila! The envelope<br/>
is part of another quest, but I am not sure what it<br/>
is.&lt;br&gt;I was up waiting on Dyllin until about 4 AM, but I<br/>
didn&#39;t start until midnight. So.. a night missed in exp<br/>
got me 10 wis.. very useful.&lt;br&gt;I highly advise this<br/>
quest for any cleric shaman or<br/>
druid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Druid of Spiritus<br/>
