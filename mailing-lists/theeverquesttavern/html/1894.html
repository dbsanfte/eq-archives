<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159806040">It is sad yes but unfortunately that is what we<br/>
live with in game and out. Best thing to do is to make<br/>
sure you check all that you buy before hand and to<br/>
make sure you have all the PP in the trade box before<br/>
you hit trade, and never trust one to give to another<br/>
unless you take into account the risk. It is called<br/>
living on the safe side. Sadly enough we dont live in a<br/>
completely honest world in game or out. Just have fun with<br/>
the best parts and take the bad ones as they<br/>
come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy hunting all.....;)</div>
