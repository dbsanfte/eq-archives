<div id="ygrps-yiv-663271717">Yipie! finally made lvl9 today with my main<br/>
character!&lt;br&gt;I did say i was going to introduce em all so here<br/>
is some background info on my first character on the<br/>
Bertoxxolous server (3 days 5 hours played)&lt;br&gt;Name:<br/>
Yargon&lt;br&gt;Race: Dark Elf&lt;br&gt;Class: Shadow Knight&lt;br&gt;Deity:<br/>
Innoruuk&lt;br&gt;Trade Skill(s): Tailoring, Smithing.&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m glad to<br/>
finally have my spells and pet! I love playing around<br/>
with pets ;-) Although SK pets are verry weak (con<br/>
green always) they are verry handy as an extra attack<br/>
or a ways of escape, as a MoB will go after the pet<br/>
instead of you...&lt;br&gt;So if ya see me on Berto give me a<br/>
hail!</div>
