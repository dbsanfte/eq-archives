<div id="ygrps-yiv-267729439">It really comes down to a question of what you<br/>
see your role in a group as. A bard will never do<br/>
alot of damage with just hand to hand, but if you&#39;re<br/>
in a group with a couple tanks, by all means put<br/>
away that sword and equip your drum and play away.<br/>
You&#39;re probably more valuable to the group as a sort of<br/>
caster, twisting chant of battle, chords of dissonance if<br/>
you can safely without pulling more mobs, and be<br/>
ready with the Hymn of Restoration if needed and Selo&#39;s<br/>
if your party has to make a break for it. You&#39;ll<br/>
want to try to keep both hand to hand and your chosen<br/>
weapon skill/skills maxed as much as you can, (not an<br/>
easy task as you level quickly for the early levels).<br/>
After the tanks put some damage on the mob, however,<br/>
you can step in and start swinging fists without<br/>
doing enough damage to taunt them off the tanks. Chords<br/>
of Dissonance seems to taunt them nicely though,<br/>
which could be good or bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some invaluable<br/>
information I&#39;ve found can be seen<br/>
