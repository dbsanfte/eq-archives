<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428415889">&quot;I would much rather deal with a twink over a<br/>
noobie beggar any day.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hmm, never thought about<br/>
it, but I guess I&#39;d agree. Twinks don&#39;t bug you for<br/>
stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for little gifts, like the FS swords, or<br/>
receiving items for a service, I have absolutely no problem<br/>
for that. And, like Xela&#39;s, my guild doesn&#39;t twink,<br/>
but we sell stuff for ludicrously low prices. I got a<br/>
runed circlet and a velium etched stone mace for 400pp.<br/>
What a deal! =D&lt;br&gt;Anyway, there probably is some<br/>
truth to the fact that I&#39;m jealous. Of course it&#39;s<br/>
true! Being a stupid half-elf, I always want more WIS.<br/>
And I can&#39;t afford anything, so I just look and<br/>
drool. And I&#39;m lately being a bit of a hippocrate, since<br/>
I just today found out my friend on the Prexus<br/>
server was cancelling her acount (40-something bard with<br/>
lots of stuff) and she said she&#39;d give me her stuff if<br/>
I made a char on Prexus. So I will. I want free<br/>
stuff; it&#39;s always good. (hehe.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry about<br/>
length; I&#39;ll be surprised if anyone reads this far<br/>
anyway. ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanissa Noryk of Norraths Keepers&lt;br&gt;35<br/>
