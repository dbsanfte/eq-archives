<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130368623">As far as your last characters... if you quit<br/>
more than 3 months ago, there is a good chance they&#39;ve<br/>
been wiped. SOE usually holds on to folks&#39; characters<br/>
for 3 months from when their last pay period was<br/>
ended. If it&#39;s been more than that, there&#39;s about a 3%<br/>
chance they&#39;ll still be there... sometimes SOE misses<br/>
some cleanup duties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as servers... I&#39;m<br/>
going to agree with Xela.&lt;br&gt;I enjoy playing on Xev,<br/>
usually. And Firiona Vie is a kick. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai<br/>
