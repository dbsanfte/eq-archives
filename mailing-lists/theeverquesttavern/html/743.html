<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116215900">Hey,&lt;br&gt;My smithing skill is 34 now. I have been<br/>
practicing making scalers, but I never get a scaler, I get a<br/>
file and a large container lid mold EVERY time I try<br/>
to make a scaler. Is this normal? And does anyone<br/>
know what else I could practice making besides armor,<br/>
I try and fail every time, smithing is expensive<br/>
