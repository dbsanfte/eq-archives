<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067256879">peeps are other players,twinks are people who are<br/>
in possesion of things that they&#39;re level is not<br/>
currently capable of having gotten on they&#39;re own as far as<br/>
class goes the ones you mentioned are all available in<br/>
the wood elf starting out in kelethin.one server is<br/>
pretty much the same as another with the exeption of the<br/>
pvp servers where players can kill each other and<br/>
loot some stuff from the kill.Myself i havent played<br/>
on pvp but intend to at some point,and as far as<br/>
characters you can have per server i think it&#39;s eight per so<br/>
you can almost have one of each class i really love<br/>
the hybrid classes ie ranger shadow knight paladin<br/>
cause they give you a little taste of two classes at<br/>
the same time&lt;br&gt;good luck with your start and hope<br/>
you run into people that will be helpful in your<br/>
journeys lot of nice people that play eq</div>
