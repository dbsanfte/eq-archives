<b>Subject:</b> Hurrieta&#39;s Tunic <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325997873">I was fishing(as usual), off of the boat dock in<br/>
Qeynos, when I overheard a conversation with a NPC<br/>
fisherman, fishing beside me. The NPC told this other guy to<br/>
dive in the water and bring him back his tackle box.<br/>
Just then 20 people jumped in the water at once.(I<br/>
guess they overheard it too.) Not wanting to feel left<br/>
out, I jumped in there too. Lucky me though, I found<br/>
the tackle box. I gave it to this NPC and he gave me<br/>
experience and Hurrieta&#39;s Tunic.&lt;br&gt;I tried equiping it, I<br/>
can&#39;t. I tried selling it, They won&#39;t give me anything<br/>
for it. It is totally useless to me.&lt;br&gt;Does anyone<br/>
know what class benefits from this, or do I give it to<br/>
another NPC somewhere. No-one I have talked to knows what<br/>
this thing even is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope someone can help me.</div>
