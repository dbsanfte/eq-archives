<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492053540">As far as armor-- it simply depends on how much<br/>
money you have. Of course you want to try to get<br/>
something better than Banded-- but can you afford<br/>
it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing I look at always is -- do I have enough<br/>
money to purchase all the spells I want to get in my<br/>
next circle of spells. If I have enough, then I will<br/>
go ahead and buy. If not... no dice.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, I&#39;m not a very experienced player for the levels<br/>
18 and above. However, I&#39;ve got at least 12<br/>
characters between level 4 and 16. (Probably a lot more).<br/>
And I&#39;ve grouped almost all my character&#39;s lives past<br/>
level 4. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So now with my level 22nd Druid, I<br/>
keep looking at EQ web sites for info on armor and<br/>
weapons. That&#39;d be my advice for you. Look and try to find<br/>
out what you&#39;re looking for and ask for price checks<br/>
on the item in your server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t have much<br/>
experience with Evil races unfortunately, but as far as<br/>
killing-- both Derv camps and Lavastorm will be cool places<br/>
to kill... HOWEVER-- Lavastorm is much less camped<br/>
and if you&#39;re looking for a group (and I always<br/>
am)... I prefer Derv camps. Easy to form a group up<br/>
there. Exp will be a lot smoother b/c of grouping.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re looking to solo though, Lavastorm is<br/>
perfect. I hate the Downtime from recovering from a fight<br/>
though. I did Lavastorm for a while and only got into two<br/>
groups. One was prearranged with friends ahead of time.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out... aka Fatedhue<br/>
Prismatic of the Drinal Server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS Another comment<br/>
about the Derv Camps. Dervs drop cutthroat rings. These<br/>
can be used in quests to improve faction I believe.<br/>
That might be a consideration. If you can kill<br/>
efficiently in a constant stream in a group at Lavastorm<br/>
though, I found loot to be great for level 12-15 range--<br/>
although by 15 my exp there wasn&#39;t that great. By level 15<br/>
I was in Oasis.</div>
