<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922064787">Iksars are very cool because they regen health<br/>
very fast, so soloing is easier. The drawback to<br/>
Iksars is that you are a hated race...so banking<br/>
anywhere but Kunark and Velious is incredibly<br/>
tough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find that iksars are kinda of a boring race when<br/>
young in that you don&#39;t see any other races fighting<br/>
along side of you. Once you approach level 16ish,<br/>
you&#39;ll fight in Lake of Ill Omen, and then you&#39;ll see<br/>
other races. Get used to staring at other lizards until<br/>
then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t worry about your first character...you probably<br/>
won&#39;t keep him/her after you&#39;ve gotten the jist of the<br/>
game. And READ, READ, READ out at eq.castersrealm.com.<br/>
That&#39;s a great resource.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CoJim, Druid of the 26th<br/>
