<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064904015">When talking about OverThere... beware of Goons,<br/>
aka Dragoons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They&#39;re roughly level 50 roaming<br/>
mobs in OT and many a party has been disbanded for<br/>
having them wander through and kill them one too many<br/>
times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Goon&#39;s are faster than wolf form and I believe<br/>
even or maybe faster than Greater Wolf form. With a<br/>
bard with an instrument-- might help you outrun one.<br/>
Might.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if you have a druid or ranger in your group when<br/>
you&#39;re in OT-- make sure they know to check Track every<br/>
so often. Otherwise... OT is an awesome place for<br/>
around 30. Before that LOIO is also awesome. Course<br/>
killing in Kunark all the time might get tiring. You<br/>
might want to try Velious at 30 instead of OT. Snow<br/>
Cougars should be good exp at 30 and you might get a good<br/>
earring. (cougar claw)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grin.&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
