<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560500144">I have successfully made it into the warrens on<br/>
several occasions. It sounds like you are either having<br/>
trouble with Habbib in the Paineel newbie zone, or you<br/>
are going too far into the Warrens. Habbib is a pain,<br/>
but you can outrun him most of the time, especially<br/>
if you have SoW. When I visit the warrens with my<br/>
druid, I usually kill Habbib and let his corpse lie<br/>
there to help out any non-heretic newbies trying to get<br/>
to the warrens. Note: the warrens is a lvl 6 or<br/>
above dungeon. I would advise waiting until about 7 or<br/>
8 so that you have no trouble with any of the<br/>
skeletons guarding the paineel zone. Other than that,<br/>
