<div id="ygrps-yiv-756343254">You don&#39;t HAVE to but if you don&#39;t it will start<br/>
becoming very expensive as you get higher lvls. As a<br/>
newbie, as long as you aren&#39;t *twinked*, then losing your<br/>
guild tunic isn&#39;t that important and you get more food<br/>
until lvl 5, I think its lvl 5. Actually alot of people<br/>
kill themselves whenever they run out of food so they<br/>
don&#39;t have to buy more. 8) Just keep you money in the<br/>
bank after you go sell your stuff if you think you may<br/>
not want to go get your corpse if you<br/>
die.&lt;br&gt;-Khalista&lt;br&gt;Cleric of Tunare</div>
