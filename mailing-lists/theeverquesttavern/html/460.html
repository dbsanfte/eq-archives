<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001153583">So far the only orcs i don&#39;t want to mess with<br/>
for now are the orc centurians... i did fine with<br/>
them when my sword was ok...i think i either sold it<br/>
by mistake or stood out in the rain too long (if<br/>
thats possible)...i&#39;m still doing the really stupid<br/>
sh*t like forgetting to shut off auto attack when i<br/>
aproach a merchant but am really good at locating my<br/>
corpse now ..lol. I saw a bandit attacked by someone<br/>
with diff color letters over their head and then he<br/>
yelled for help which i did&#39;nt help cause he started<br/>
it..also found alot of people will take my kills away from<br/>
me if they get the chance so now i don&#39;t hesitate<br/>
looting if i see a corpse lying on the ground with no one<br/>
around it. Also found that the long swords cost 15 p ...<br/>
i think i have 8 :(&lt;br&gt;and have no clue about<br/>
finding quests. Still getting use to the language<br/>
too...what do they mean by train to (where ever) alot of<br/>
people leaving to same town? Hope to run into some of<br/>
you someday... i&#39;m thinking about creating a new<br/>
charactor and calling her clueless. Bye for now.</div>
