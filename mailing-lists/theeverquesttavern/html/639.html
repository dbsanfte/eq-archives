<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875234305">My wiz is lvl 42 and i am referring to the class<br/>
balance system here!! I know how to play my wiz and am a<br/>
guild leader who has many characters! i have grped with<br/>
many characters who said i was the best roleplayer for<br/>
my class they have ever been with!! This<br/>
doesn&#39;tchange the facts! As the master of dd there we should<br/>
always do more damager than other classes.However, at<br/>
certain lvls other classes do more damage than us!! Play<br/>
the wizzy if ya like up to you this is to all the<br/>
nubies out there that want the truth!! Also chances are<br/>
you got the wizzy to the lvl before they nerfed the<br/>
hell out of the class!! Later!</div>
