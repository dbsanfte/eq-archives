<div id="ygrps-yiv-312842412">Hmm... As a lv 4 player, I had about... 2 plats<br/>
to my name. When I hit level 6 though, that&#39;s when I<br/>
got all the BIG money. Now I&#39;m in Rivervale and I<br/>
have currently 50 plats to my name. Would have more,<br/>
but 9th level spells are expensive fer a Druid... :O<br/>
..(specially when you buy every one...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; How did I make<br/>
all this money?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Hmm.. well, since I&#39;m a Druid<br/>
I gave heals at the Wall. I never asked for<br/>
donations, but people gave me money anyway. And also I sang<br/>
songs for them. That earned me even more<br/>
money....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ..And though I&#39;m a Druid, I must say, when you<br/>
get to a higher level kill some bears. High Quality<br/>
Bear Skins can be sold for 15PP sometimes<br/>
more...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ..But... Just work on killing all you can, and<br/>
save some money in the bank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And basically,<br/>
this didn&#39;t help much at all....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But ah.. read<br/>
the other&#39;s posts! They seem to know what they&#39;re<br/>
talking about! :) ? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; and I know this says I&#39;m<br/>
replying to someone else, but I was too lazy to go back<br/>
and type on another post....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; so.. For the<br/>
person worried about money: Don&#39;t sweat it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>
