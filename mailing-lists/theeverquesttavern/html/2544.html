<b>Subject:</b> Re: AC & Agility <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547966625">Keep the AC 6 bracers and lose the Serpentine. The bonuses are trivial <br/>
to your proc rate (unless they are tremendous bonuses) and it&#39;s not <br/>
worth losing the AC over. <br/>
<br/>
Agility measures how fast you can increase your defensive skills, and <br/>
adds a little AC. Being a Ranger you should have a pretty high AGI <br/>
score anyway. Again, the bonuses aren&#39;t worth the loss of AC.<br/>
<br/>
The only exception would be if you need to get a stat over a hump, <br/>
e.g. getting an attribute to over 75 or 100 or 200. Even then, it&#39;s a <br/>
hard argument to lose AC.<br/>

&gt; Okay folks, I just got two I think they were<br/>
&gt; serpentine bracers (AC 1 Dex +2?maybe 3, Agility +9) Well my<br/>
&gt; ranger has two bracers at the moment with 6ac a piece.<br/>
&gt; When I put on my new bracers I loose a lot of AC. I<br/>
&gt; want to know since agility means less hits and damage,<br/>
&gt; whether or not loosing this AC is a bad thing or will my<br/>
&gt; new agility help out more?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kinda confused.<br/>
&gt; Tried both ways against the same conned creature and it<br/>
&gt; seemed with new bracers i got hit more. Please help<br/>
&gt; out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mykeal&lt;br&gt;Ranger of the 17th season in worship of our <br/>
