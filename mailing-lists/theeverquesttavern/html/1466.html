<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288467911">Hey everyone! Awhile back, when I was hopelessly<br/>
addicted to Evercra--err Everquest, I began writing a<br/>
story based on one of my characters. Considering how<br/>
far I usually get with a story,or rather, how quickly<br/>
I stop writing before I get far at all, the story<br/>
took off and the ideas flowed! I had the whole story<br/>
planned out, but then I hit a writers block... how do I<br/>
keep writing when I don&#39;t know what to say? Well,<br/>
that&#39;s usually the way of it, I guess. With that, the<br/>
project died and I kept the story in my archives... until<br/>
recently. A few days ago I came across a website,<br/>
www.stories.com. The site is rather innovative and I quickly saw<br/>
potential in it for myself. So, yesterday (or was it the<br/>
day before?) I went ahead and posted 2 of my stories,<br/>
including the one linked<br/>
below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315">http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315&lt;/a">http://www.stories.com/main/interact.php?action=view&item_id=148315&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, my writers block on both stories is still in<br/>
place and I need some help.. Therefore I&#39;ve set up the<br/>
stories to be interactive.. Basicly an Interactive Story<br/>
is one where, at the end of each chapter, the reader<br/>
is given several options. As the story progresses,<br/>
the reader will eventually reach a choice that hasn&#39;t<br/>
been written yet. At this point, the reader is given<br/>
the opportunity to add to the story, further<br/>
developing the plot. I&#39;ve done this to see what people come<br/>
up with. New ideas might help break down my writers<br/>
block.. if it doesn&#39;t, then at least it&#39;ll be fun to<br/>
watch a story develop at the hands of whoever reads it!<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ll also post the first small section of the<br/>
story in just a moment. If you like what you read,<br/>
please go visit the Interactive Story version at the<br/>
link above and read the rest. Then, PLEASE rate it..<br/>
feedback is important and without a rating, I&#39;ll never<br/>
know what people think. Also, if your interested, feel<br/>
free to contribute to the story! I won&#39;t delete<br/>
anything at all that&#39;s written by someone who takes the<br/>
story seriously and has played enough EQ to know what<br/>
they&#39;re talkin about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darkmyst - A once great Dark<br/>
