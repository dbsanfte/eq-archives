<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-682747914">I don&#39;t think I am going to have it based off of<br/>
the origin of EQ. I&#39;m probably going to do something<br/>
describing the races, dieties, careers, and equipment. My<br/>
school has a SmartBoard that they project screens on<br/>
with a projector hooked up to a computer&#39;s video card.<br/>
I could possibly do the PowerPoint (PP)<br/>
presentation with this, but I&#39;ve never used PP. I have Office<br/>
2000 Premium, and I have PP, but I&#39;ve never used it.<br/>
The report should be at least 5 mins long, and I have<br/>
to make an outline as well. I&#39;ll try tinkering<br/>
around w/ PP, and see what I can do. If you can give me<br/>
any info, or help me out with a PP presentation,<br/>
reply or email me directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:safritz@...">safritz@...</a></div>
