<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335527149">Just thought I&#39;d like to share my favorite<br/>
hunting grounds, as well as hear from some others about<br/>
they places they frequest for XP and loot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
have discovered the joys of the Warrens. Besides being<br/>
relatively quiet, with rarely more than a half dozen people<br/>
there, you can safely hunt there, even solo, from about<br/>
level 7 to 30. Being a dungeon, you recieve an XP bonus<br/>
there as well. And the faction CAN NOT be beat. You<br/>
only lose faction with the kobolds themselves, while<br/>
gaining faction with both the Heretics and the good<br/>
Erudites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only that, but the loot tables there are off the<br/>
charts. A mid-teen character can easily make 150pp+ in a<br/>
day&#39;s worth of fighting there. Bronze weapons drop like<br/>
mad, so does cash. Better items when you reach around<br/>
20-25 drop off of the named mobs. Crown, Scepter,<br/>
Cloak, etc. of the Forlorn, lots of class-specific<br/>
items, and some pretty decent armor, both Cold Iron and<br/>
Soft Wicker, drop throughout the zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best<br/>
classes to bring in there are probably monks, shaman,<br/>
warriors, shadowknights, necros, or really any true<br/>
casters. Lots of INT items in there, as well as mana<br/>
boosting and WIS items. There are also quests in the<br/>
Warrens specifically for Heretics and Paladins from<br/>
Erudin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only downside of the zone is the random spawns of mobs<br/>
who are a bit TOO high for younger characters to<br/>
handle. Twice last night we had to zone because something<br/>
wandered up to us that was at least 5 levels higher and<br/>
resisted nearly all our spells. Other than that, not too<br/>
many problems. Even the pathing in there is pretty<br/>
predictable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and farmers/loot whores shouldn&#39;t bother going:<br/>
if you&#39;re too high level to get XP, or the creature<br/>
you killed was FAR too easy for your group, you don&#39;t<br/>
get to loot the rare drops that creature might<br/>
have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&#39;s hear YOUR fave place to hunt. What do you like<br/>
about it? Where&#39;s it at? Some tips for newcomers?</div>
