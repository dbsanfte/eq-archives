<b>Subject:</b> Escape From Aviak Island <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317666506">My friend Mordiki and I headed to Aviak Island<br/>
last night in the ocean of Tears. Mordiki is a Ranger,<br/>
I am an Enchanter, bot level 19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Short<br/>
description of the aviaks on the island:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starlings -<br/>
green, very easy for level 19&lt;br&gt;Turaco - green/blue,<br/>
fairly easy&lt;br&gt;Tanager - blue/even, ideal&lt;br&gt;Quezatol -<br/>
usually red, too difficult for just 2 people&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We<br/>
could actually have killed a Quezatol, but the danger<br/>
and resulting downtime were too great to warrant<br/>
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once there, we started pulling, but it was difficult<br/>
because another group of 4 players was grabbing all the<br/>
Turacos and Tanagers. Starlings were giving us crap loot<br/>
and no exp. And we refused to even try a Quezatol. We<br/>
had an escape plan in case we did pull a<br/>
Quezatol:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Mordiki informs me that doom and destruction is<br/>
incoming.&lt;br&gt;2) I levitate myself and wait for Mordiki.&lt;br&gt;3) I<br/>
levitate him while he&#39;s incoming.&lt;br&gt;4) We take off over<br/>
the ocean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, eventually it happened.<br/>
Mordiki pulled a Tanager and a Quezatol spawned in front<br/>
of him as he was pulling the Tanager back. So we<br/>
perfectly executed our brilliant plan and took off. Then I<br/>
switched views to look behind us, and discovered that the<br/>
damn birds were right behind us and standing up, not<br/>
swimming. It&#39;s as if they were running along the water.<br/>
This was bad. Then I realized that I had no clue what<br/>
direction we were heading or where the hell we were. This<br/>
was really bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mordiki tried casting Ensnare<br/>
on them and I tried Mezzing them, but you cannot<br/>
cast spells on a monster if it&#39;s in water and you&#39;re<br/>
not. We kept running. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Mordiki starts<br/>
getting attacked. I thought &quot;How did they catch up to<br/>
us?&quot;. I look around, and even though I&#39;m running, I&#39;m<br/>
not moving forward. We hit the zone border, an<br/>
invisible wall in the ocean. This has officially become a<br/>
nightmare. So let me recap:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have no idea where we<br/>
are in the ocean.&lt;br&gt;We cannot see land<br/>
anywhere.&lt;br&gt;We are being attacked by red birds.&lt;br&gt;We cannot<br/>
run.&lt;br&gt;I cannot cast spells on the birds.&lt;br&gt;Mordiki is at<br/>
2 bubbles of health.&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s raining. (couldn&#39;t see<br/>
crap)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I cast Rune on Mordiki to keep him alive, then the<br/>
birds decide I should die for that. I get pimp slapped<br/>
down to 2 bubbles. We break and run. We get separated.<br/>
I figure it cannot get any worse at this point.<br/>
Lord Nagafen could take a giant dump on me and it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t get any worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the Gods smile upon<br/>
me...I see land! (I&#39;m agnostic, but whatever) I scream<br/>
for Mordiki to track me. He says he has me and is on<br/>
the way. I reach land and prepare myself for our last<br/>
ditch effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see him running up with the<br/>
birds in close pursuit and I successfully Mez the<br/>
Quezatol! Then the Tanager that was with him comes running<br/>
over and starts bitching me. I quickly drop to one<br/>
bubble. I febbly try to cast a Mez between his hits. I<br/>
almost get one off but then he hits me...&quot;You continue<br/>
your casting.&quot;...&quot;A Tanager has been enthralled.&quot;<br/>
WOOHOO! I quickly sit down and memorize Memory blur. My<br/>
hope is that I can Blur them before they awake. I Blur<br/>
the Tanager first by accident. The recycle time on<br/>
Blur is WAY too long. The Tanager breaks mez and<br/>
begins to walk off. I get scared, because I mezzed the<br/>
Tanager SECOND and he&#39;s already broken free from it.<br/>
Memory Blur cycles. I cast. Quezatol break Mez and<br/>
rushed me. He is on top of me swinging. &quot;A Quezatol<br/>
blinks a few times.&quot; He strolls<br/>
off....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enchanters rule.</div>
