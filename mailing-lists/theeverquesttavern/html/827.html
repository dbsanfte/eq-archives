<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045878117">1) all servers are at one place (San Diego) so<br/>
should all be dependable as much as the next<br/>
one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) This is a though question that noby really can<br/>
answer. It comes down to what YOU like to play as.<br/>
However Start out your first character as a human<br/>
warrior. They are nightblidn wich really sucks but you<br/>
should see that character as a &quot;throwaway&quot; You will get<br/>
the hang of playing the game and interacting with the<br/>
game engine. Humans have the easiest newby area&#39;s and<br/>
least complicated cities, and warriors don&#39;t have to<br/>
worry about magic. So play one for a while till you<br/>
feel confident to start a real character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3)<br/>
It&#39;s a long time since i played the tutorial :) but<br/>
it&#39;s all in there play it a couple of times... it<br/>
helps!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Not really. As a newby there will be newby<br/>
hunting ground where you can spend until lvlv 5 getting<br/>
exp. you can also do some simple quests getting exp<br/>
but most involve killing stuff. In the newby areas<br/>
there are guards that will help you if you are in<br/>
trouble. But you are never &quot;safe&quot; trying to get<br/>
exp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) I play on a PII 266 with a voodoo2 card and 160<br/>
MB RAM. The RAM made a HUGE different while playing.<br/>
I hardly lag anymore because of my system. On<br/>
Kunard however i need to turn my clipping rate down a<br/>
lot to be able to smoothly play. (under f10 then<br/>
options, display)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck</div>
