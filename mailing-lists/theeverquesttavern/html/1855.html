<div id="ygrps-yiv-952733092">*cough cough... hack up a lung b/c of bronchitis<br/>
and getting my umbrella folded in 4 very un-natural<br/>
pieces by the storm... thus walking through the rain for<br/>
a bit*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This does however, make me call in<br/>
sick instead of trying to bear it out answering phones<br/>
while coughing... anyhoo...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My point in this<br/>
post (besides exuding pitiablness.. grin)... is to<br/>
say...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I am guilded with a person I&#39;m not much fond<br/>
of... I let my guild leaders and some guildmates know.<br/>
I also try to teach them when I end up grouped with<br/>
them. Doesn&#39;t happen often that I&#39;m grouped and it&#39;s a<br/>
bad series though-- we usually adjust to each other<br/>
fairly well. My guild leaders usually do a good job of<br/>
straightening out the members. We don&#39;t mind enthusiasm but we<br/>
try to make sure of patience, and consideration.<br/>
Which is actually a harder thing to do that you&#39;d<br/>
think. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.... perhaps I<br/>
shouldn&#39;t post when I&#39;m sick. I&#39;m too easily distracted,<br/>
and it&#39;s hard to tell if I&#39;m making<br/>
sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic, Druid on Drinal</div>
