<b>Subject:</b> Re: I am new - servers AND characters <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187378908">First off that dwarf paladin would be pretty<br/>
awesome. There aren&#39;t enough dwarven healers in the game,<br/>
they&#39;re really underrated and really good. Your first<br/>
character should be a warrior, again, so you can learn the<br/>
combat system. But after that a dwarf paladin would<br/>
rock.&lt;br&gt;Servers - the newer servers, such as Luclin and Lanys<br/>
T&#39;Vyl are full of newer characters, they generally have<br/>
less people on at any time. The number of people on a<br/>
server affects lag time, so if you&#39;re worried about lag<br/>
join a server with a few amount of people during peak<br/>
time (equivalent to primetime in TV land). But these<br/>
servers generally have younger characters with less<br/>
experience than others. The older servers - Fennin Ro and<br/>
Veeshan especially - tend to have the worst lag but the<br/>
most serious players. Pick whatever you want.<br/>
Personally I like Prexus - medium lag and medium level of<br/>
seriousness. But it&#39;s your choice.</div>
