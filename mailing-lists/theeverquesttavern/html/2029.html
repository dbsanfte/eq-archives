<div id="ygrps-yiv-68239541">At that level you&#39;re not gonna find very much<br/>
extremely good but here&#39;s an easy method for some cash and<br/>
exp that might work okay for a level<br/>
8.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skeletons should be easy enough for you. There&#39;s a lot of<br/>
quests out there for bone chips. Usually you get an item<br/>
and some coins and exp to boot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ex:<br/>
Felwithe&lt;br&gt;&quot;The cleric guildmaster, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf, will<br/>
reward you for killing skeletons and returning with<br/>
bonechips. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Return to him four bonechips (stacked<br/>
will work) for faction, money and an item, normally a<br/>
first level cleric spell. &quot; (from<br/>
Allakhazam&#39;s)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are similar for many zones. Felwithe is just one<br/>
I chose at random.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The exp is decent for<br/>
your level, it&#39;s not too hard, and you get stuff to<br/>
sell for even more coins. It&#39;s not gonna get you<br/>
stupifying amounts of cash but each 4 should net you a<br/>
couple of gold probably and Exp. (Just don&#39;t forget to<br/>
work on skills)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
