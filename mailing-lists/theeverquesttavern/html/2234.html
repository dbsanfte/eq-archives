<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655358888">sounds like you may be real new to this game, so<br/>
i will cover this in some detail. if you have any<br/>
questions afterwords, feel free to ask. the rusty swords<br/>
are rewards you get when you loot a corpse. when you<br/>
kill something, click on it and you will recieve any<br/>
money it has plus a box will pop up showing you what<br/>
the creature is carrying. click on any object and you<br/>
can transfer it to your inventory. if you right click<br/>
and hold it on an object, a box will pop up and show<br/>
the name and stats on the object you clicked on. not<br/>
all creatures have objects on them, some just have<br/>
money. so, do not be surprised if you have to kill and<br/>
loot from quite a few mobs. when you get all 4 swords,<br/>
take them back to the person who gave you the quest.<br/>
click on 1 sword and it will transfer it from your<br/>
inventory to your mouse arrow. move the sword until it<br/>
covers the picture of the person you want and click on<br/>
him. a box will appear with the sword in it plus<br/>
openings for 3 more objects. place the 3 remaining swords<br/>
in the empty spots. at the bottom of the box are<br/>
smaller boxes that say trade (i think) and<br/>
cancel.&lt;br&gt;click on trade and the 4 swords wil be given to the<br/>
person and you will recieve some exp. and usually a few<br/>
rewards. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;as far as finding your way around goes,<br/>
the best advice i can give is to go to eqatlas.com.<br/>
he has very good maps that you can print off for<br/>
free. i find his zone connection maps to be extremely<br/>
useful in finding you way around at first. good<br/>
luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;elryche&lt;br&gt;41 barbarian shaman</div>
