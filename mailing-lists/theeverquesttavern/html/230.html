<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905032921">Anyone who thinks a train in Blackburrow or<br/>
crushbone is hell you havent even felt the horror of<br/>
Cazic-Thule. Last night i was killed in 6 trains(only 3 of<br/>
them were made by my group....shhhhhh) anyway being in<br/>
one of those trains is like havin 4 or 5 ammbasador<br/>
D&#39;Vinns after you =) Over all i made about 1 and a half<br/>
bubbles of exp. I gave up after most of my group<br/>
left.&lt;br&gt;Oh well on a hapier subject i managed to get my<br/>
hands on a Staff of Writhing (del 33, dam 9, -9 cha,<br/>
and spell effect chaotic feedback wich will do about<br/>
50pts of damage as soon as i hit level 30) quite a<br/>
quality weapon. I now also have full Bronze armor wich i<br/>
think looks prety slick. Hehe i just had to tell my<br/>
progress. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor, 23rd League Standing,<br/>
