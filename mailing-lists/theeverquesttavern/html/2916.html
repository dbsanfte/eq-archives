<div id="ygrps-yiv-149917800">and with every expansion, there will be another privilege<br/>
<br/>
with PoP its not only the ability to get much better experience in the new zones after lvl 55 but, the plane of knowledge transport system allowing you to click a transport stone and book from PoK to just outside every major city in the game.<br/>
(much to the dismay of druids and wizards everywhere)  and of course the raid system that allows all persons in the raid to get exp but only works if you have the PoP expansion.  <br/>
<br/>
the bazaar is just part of luclin&#39;s privilege<br/>
so basically u get as much as u pay for in terms of expansion<br/>
<br/>
personally i think its worth it<br/>
they dont cost that much<br/>

  Sorry, but if you mean that they might &quot;listen&quot; create another Bazaar <br/>
  zone in Freeport - ain&#39;t gonna happen.  That&#39;s the &quot;hook&quot; to get you <br/>
  to buy Luclin, apart from the Nexus transit system.  Doubt they&#39;ll do <br/>
  anything to reduce sales of an expansion.<br/>
