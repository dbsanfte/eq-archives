<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606472704">Well what race are you? Qeynos Hills and East<br/>
Commonlands are nice areas for that level if you are around<br/>
either Qeynos or Freeport. If you&#39;re a wood elf, there<br/>
are some areas in Greater Faydark to hit, perhaps the<br/>
bandit camp near Kelethin. Don&#39;t know how tough these<br/>
bandits would be for your level, but from now on, you&#39;ll<br/>
want at least 1 partner, maybe a mage or tank class<br/>
(warrior, ranger, etc.). They take the damage and use melee<br/>
while you sit back, heal, and ensnare. Just don&#39;t do<br/>
either too much or too early, lest you want to get<br/>
beaten on. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Screenshots are available in your<br/>
C:&#92;Windows&#92;Program Files&#92;Everquest folder. They will be called<br/>
EQ000000, EQ000001, etc. They are bitmaps, around 1MB in<br/>
size each, so you&#39;ll want to save them as JPEGs if you<br/>
want to save any of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51st<br/>
