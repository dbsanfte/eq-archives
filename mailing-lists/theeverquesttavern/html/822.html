<b>Subject:</b> Ra Family at BlackBurrow <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-799767748">Last night, I was hanging out by the entrance to<br/>
BB, when all of a sudden, I am ambushed by a family<br/>
of named gnolls. The Ra Family. After being cast<br/>
upon and attacked by like 9 or so of them, I died. I<br/>
started /ooc-ing people to see if someone knew anything.<br/>
Apparently no-one had ever seen or heard of these guys<br/>
before. And they are tough. With about 10 other PC&#39;s<br/>
fighting them, one of which was a 51st level enchanter,<br/>
the Ra Family showed their strength. Everyone of the<br/>
PC&#39;s died. Even Mr. 51st level got smoked. It took me<br/>
about a half an hour to drag my corpse away from the<br/>
scene. It was a mess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does anyone have any info<br/>
on these rat-bast**ds? The front of BB used to a<br/>
nice hunting ground for those graduating newbies<br/>
around the Qeynos area. But I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going<br/>
back there for a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for any info you<br/>
can get for me.</div>
