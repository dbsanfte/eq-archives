<div id="ygrps-yiv-95182194">Anywhere you go it is always good to have an<br/>
ideal formation of balanced characters, especially in<br/>
dungeons. I would say at least 2 characters need to be<br/>
hardcore tanks, but 3 or even 4 will work. Warriors,<br/>
paladins, rangers, and shadow nights are usually the best<br/>
at tanking. Then you need some magic users. In my<br/>
experience the two necessary magic users are clerics and<br/>
shamen. Shamen have spirit of the wolf, which makes your<br/>
group able to escape from most any battle if needed,<br/>
plus their buffs are great. Clerics should buff and<br/>
heal the tanks ad nauseum. Enchanters work well too -<br/>
mesmerize lets you pick on the mobs one at a time. Wizards<br/>
are pure offense and can smoke mobs like no one else.<br/>
Magicians are nice - food when you run out is handy. Necros<br/>
are pretty tight too. Bards are underrated and can do<br/>
the jobs of many at once. Try to always be in a group<br/>
of 6, and perhaps befriend another group and watch<br/>
each other&#39;s backs. Get some experienced pullers,<br/>
don&#39;t get in over your head, and communicate. As far as<br/>
in Cazic itself, I&#39;ve never been, but any place<br/>
named after the God of Fear has to be horrific. Check<br/>
out Allakhazam&#39;s page,<br/>
&lt;a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com target=new&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com&lt;/a&gt; - he has all kinds of useful info. Hope this<br/>
helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Half-elf warrior of 12 seasons&lt;br&gt;Prexus</div>
