<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899788675">Phew what a time that was, i didnt get a chance<br/>
to be involved with the actual fight. BUT i did get<br/>
to battle the undead forces for about 15 min in<br/>
kithicor....that was until a gm showed up and took them away<br/>
because the loot was too good =( Yes the light side won<br/>
on our server. There were about 115 people in<br/>
kithicor woods fighting the undead in the aftermath...and<br/>
i have to say it was the funest camp i got involved<br/>
with. The undead even gave exp to me, kithicor was a<br/>
deadly place those nights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin, 43 Bard on the<br/>
