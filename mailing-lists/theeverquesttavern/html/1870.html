<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-479249204">So the true question is why don&#39;t we like twinks?<br/>
Is it because they have an unfair advantage in<br/>
leveling (high level buffs do the same thing)? Or is it<br/>
that they flaunt it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recently started an<br/>
Iksar monk. I made it through lvl 6 on my own, but then<br/>
a friend giving up EQ seriously twinked me. So, I&#39;m<br/>
flighting white/yellows instead of blues. I&#39;m leveling<br/>
quickly, I&#39;m already 12. I don&#39;t flaunt it, etc. But it<br/>
does get annoying the number of characters that<br/>
inspect me now. ;) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was also given a large<br/>
amount of plat, but I doubt I&#39;ll use any of it until the<br/>
mid-twenties. Monks don&#39;t have to buy spells...this is my first<br/>
non-caster...wow, does money add up quickly!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, twinks<br/>
that want to duel? That&#39;s just plain mean! And of<br/>
course, I don&#39;t think twinking is cool on PVP<br/>
servers...it really is an unfair advantage. I do think that<br/>
certain items shouldn&#39;t be wearable until a certain level<br/>
on those servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a self-reliant type game<br/>
goes, I&#39;d have to disagree. I think EQ was built with<br/>
this type of thing in mind. Buffing, healing,<br/>
twinking...it&#39;s all very similar to me. Cast a skin like diamond,<br/>
a regen, SOW, STR, a DS, and a Clarity (for a<br/>
newbie caster), on a low-level person and they can fight<br/>
yellows pretty easily. Granted, it&#39;s temporary, but when<br/>
I had Breeze/Clarity cast on me, I could usually<br/>
get one full bub of exp instead of 1 blue<br/>
bub!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CoJim, Druid of the 26th<br/>
