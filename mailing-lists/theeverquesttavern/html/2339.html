<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370040017">Not a dumb question. The only server I know of<br/>
that limits you to one character is the Firiona Vie<br/>
Roleplaying server. All other servers will allow you to<br/>
create up to 8 characters and you can do this on as many<br/>
servers as you want, but since you can only play one<br/>
character at a time I am not sure why you would make so<br/>
many. I have characters on 3 different servers, and 5<br/>
characters on the main server I use but I really only play 2<br/>
of the characters I made. Go crazy, make as many as<br/>
you want and you will eventually find a character and<br/>
server that you will stay on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanjien<br/>
