<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049779415">Iksar monks may have beter regan but Human monks<br/>
outdamage Iksar.&lt;br&gt;Human= more power less regan&lt;br&gt;Iksar =<br/>
less power more regan&lt;br&gt;Human monks start with duel<br/>
weild&lt;br&gt;With iksar if u ever want to travel places safely u we<br/>
need to do soooooooooooooo much faction work. Its a<br/>
waste of time Human monk is just as good as iksar. And<br/>
just the fact when kunark came out everyone had a<br/>
twink iksar monk running around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for necro<br/>
vs sk . Necro will not win every fight. If the sk<br/>
has his resist gear on its going to be very hard for<br/>
the necro to get spells to land. And if the necro can<br/>
not get dark on and the sk is close necro = dead<br/>
quick. And the sk pet is just to keep the necro pet off<br/>
the sk for a lil bit. Any class can beat anyother<br/>
class on any given day.</div>
