<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602242616">Does anyone know if a level 14 wizard could<br/>
complete this quest? Some players on E.Q. said it was an<br/>
enchanter only quest, but on Maximum EQ it says that it is<br/>
a wizard quest too. Would i have to raise my<br/>
faction with Oggok first? And if so, how would i do<br/>
that?&lt;br&gt;Any help is greatly appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talrasha<br/>
