<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048468621">If you keep getting killed and keep losing a<br/>
level, do this simple trick. After you ding, keep<br/>
killing the exact mobs that you were killing when you<br/>
levelled. That way, you are able to get some xp before you<br/>
die again. After about a full yellow bub of xp, then<br/>
move on to a new mob.&lt;br&gt;Hope thi shelps.</div>
