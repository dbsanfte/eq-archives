<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919824257">I found a coin in the fountain thing in front of<br/>
the warrior guild in Kalidim. I have seen other<br/>
people find them in other places. What are they for? And<br/>
if you know where some of them are I would like to<br/>
know. I assume it if for a quest. But I need to know<br/>
what one, and who to give them to.</div>
