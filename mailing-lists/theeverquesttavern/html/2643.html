&gt; can anyone tell me where to find the Gnoll Brewers in Black Burrow?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At this point, I think I&#39;ve seen almost the entire place ..but I only<br/>
&gt; vaguely remember seeing them in there the 1st trip (and I didn&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; where I was going at that time)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where do they spawn and/or who is the place holder?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good luck.  The Brewers are extremely hard to find.  I leveled my Ranger<br/>
there from 6-13 and only saw a handful of them.<br/>
<br/>
They are a rare spawn.  The one spot that I remember seeing a few is<br/>
crossing the bridge and staying to the left.  That small strip of land next<br/>
to the water (that leads to the underwater ladder that takes you to the<br/>
Elite and Commander Room areas) is where one will eventually pop.  Just keep<br/>
killing anything that spawn on that strip.<br/>
<br/>
The other spot is somewhere near the Elite ledge.<br/>
