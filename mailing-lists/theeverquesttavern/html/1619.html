<div id="ygrps-yiv-743297723">I&#39;d like to see a new thread with info on the<br/>
coming MAJOR events. On Lanys T&#39;Vyl, Firiona Vie has<br/>
already summoned Tunare to speak with her about the<br/>
future of Norrath. Cazic-Thule&#39;s avatar arrived and<br/>
banished the Mother of All, as well as corrupting both<br/>
Equestrielle and the entire Lesser Faydark. LFay is now a<br/>
menacing place, dark and deadly. Undead sprites, the<br/>
corrupted forms of the once noble Fairy, flit through the<br/>
woods and attack any whose light offends<br/>
them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rugen Payne, of Ordo Ursi Prismatus, has gathered<br/>
together the individuals who have the most knowledge and<br/>
ability to command, and appointed us as generals to<br/>
gather and command armies in defense of the good aligned<br/>
cities of Norrath. I have been appointed to the defense<br/>
of Kelethin, my home city. If you are from the Lanys<br/>
Server, and wish to participate in the coming events,<br/>
please go to htpp://lanys.com/index1.htm and read the<br/>
message boards, particularly under the Tavern heading.<br/>
The First Fist of Light, a guild on Druzzil Ro (I<br/>
believe...could be Drinal) has a LOT of info on their page. We<br/>
have links to it from the General section of the<br/>
Lanys.com message boards. This is a HUGE thread, nearly 40<br/>
pages in length, with a great amount of info. It may<br/>
take you HOURS to get through it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norrath is to<br/>
undergo some huge changes in the coming months...I hope<br/>
you all are prepared for the War that is to<br/>
come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral Stormfang&lt;br&gt;Ranger&lt;br&gt;Commander of the Knights<br/>
of Prophecy&lt;br&gt;General of Kelethin&lt;br&gt;Lanys T&#39;Vyl</div>
