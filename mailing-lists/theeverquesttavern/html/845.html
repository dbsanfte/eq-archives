<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608749123">Are you guys still playing EQ? hehe&lt;br&gt;As you<br/>
know, I had stopped playing for a while... however, I<br/>
came back. I now have a lvl 47 druid on the Lanys<br/>
T&#39;vyl server (no I didn&#39;t buy an account ;P ). I like<br/>
the server much better than Mith Marr because there<br/>
is much less guild rivalry and competition over phat<br/>
lewt. Let me know how you guys are doing! =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -<br/>
