<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945369815">When I first started playing I was having a lot<br/>
of trouble connecting. I would go link dead and then<br/>
not be able to get back on. I would also lose sound<br/>
and it wouldnt come back until i backed out<br/>
completely. If it wouldnt let me back on i had to back out,<br/>
disconnect from my isp, reconnect and then i could get back<br/>
on. I went to my local computer store and bought a<br/>
$40.00 sound blaster modem and never had a problem<br/>
again. I have since switched to cable modem, it rocks!!<br/>
Hope you solve the problem. I am on the Erollisi Marr<br/>
server, look me up sometime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanjien&lt;br&gt;lvl 19<br/>
