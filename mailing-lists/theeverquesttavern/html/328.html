<b>Subject:</b> Asheron&#39;s Call Beta stuff-EQ anyday! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-842594071">Well, I recently heard news of the Beta for the<br/>
upcoming new OMMRPG Asheron&#39;s Call going public via<br/>
Computer Games Magazine. I figured I would give it a peek<br/>
so I grabbed a copy (About $7) of the mag and tried<br/>
out AC. After an hour of updates, I finally got in.<br/>
Yes, I answered the Call, but I probably should have<br/>
hung up! =P Frankly, the game was quite crummy. Nasty<br/>
lag, bad graphics, unnerving interface, miserable chat<br/>
system, the works. I was amused with a few things I might<br/>
like to see in EQ such as millions of choices for<br/>
looks and no zone lines (Actually, there are zone lines<br/>
(Portals)to get into &quot;dungeons&quot;, but none throughout the main<br/>
world) Still, I would prefer EQ any day. Some might<br/>
enjoy it, but it isn&#39;t my cup of tea and I&#39;m sure many<br/>
others will stick to Norrath rather than pack their<br/>
bags, delete their characters, and move to<br/>
Dereth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just my thoughts =) I have just got done playing AC<br/>
for a little while and the boredom drove me to vent<br/>
some opinions! hehe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS I&#39;m aware that AC is<br/>
only in beta, but it is due to release in one month,<br/>
so there isn&#39;t much that will be changed now.</div>
