<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-223463084">Ok, I have ben reading these posts and I have a<br/>
few ideas to share. 1st of all, I believe twinkung is<br/>
one of those lame things in EQ, I mean c&#39;mon, I saw a<br/>
lvl 1 mage with 200 int!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s why I switched<br/>
to Sullon Zek, only one character per account, so no<br/>
twinking unless you own two seperate accounts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To<br/>
all those newbies who want to pay RL $ for EQ $, why<br/>
don&#39;t you try out the game first before you twink<br/>
yourself. I am a hard-core Role-player, so although I have<br/>
a 58 Mage, I will never twink another<br/>
character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And 1 more thing, to all of you Shaman just starting<br/>
out, you can get enough money for Totemic armor, I am<br/>
only lvl 18 on Sullon Zek, and I already have 2 pieces<br/>
of Totemic. Just work hard and keep those skills<br/>
maxed out and you will have a great time in<br/>
Everquest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this wasn&#39;t too long 8)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aniir (any<br/>
suggestions for a surname?)&lt;br&gt;Barbarian Shaman of the 18th<br/>
season&lt;br&gt;Sullon Zek&lt;br&gt;&quot;Thicket and Vale&quot;</div>
