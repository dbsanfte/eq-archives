<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822734516">&quot;Erudite/Necro&lt;br&gt; Erudite/Enchanter&lt;br&gt;<br/>

Knight&lt;br&gt; Human/Monk&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much debate here. Depends on<br/>
what you mean by good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erudite-- yeah. I can<br/>
accept those first although there&#39;s strong competition<br/>
with High Elven Enchanters. Erudite Necro sounds about<br/>
right to me. Can&#39;t think of better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Halfling<br/>
druid is good. Big debate with this one<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Dwarf/Rogue&quot; Off the top of my head I can think of two better.<br/>
Halfling rogue and Barbarian rogues both rock a lot more.<br/>
Halflings start off in a great killing area. Halflings get<br/>
good stats with the Dex. Barbarians can&#39;t be stunned<br/>
from the front and Barbs seem like a good choice. Then<br/>
there are those that argue that DE rogue is<br/>
best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And there&#39;s no real competition though for Monk. Has<br/>
to be Iskar monk. Despite the locational drawback,<br/>
the regen alone makes Iskar more worth while. Having<br/>
forage at char gen helps too in terms of -- money issues<br/>
are always a concern with monks. They can&#39;t carry<br/>
over 14 stones (unless you&#39;re a high level and then I<br/>
think max is what-- 20 stones at 60?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall,<br/>
human stats aren&#39;t as good as Iskar stats for the<br/>
primary monk stats. And then you can&#39;t see nearly as well<br/>
with Human monks. Not sure why human monk would make<br/>
the list except for the ability to go to placed<br/>
without being KOS. (which is important but not compared<br/>
to the others-- otherwise a Troll or Ogre Warrior<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be nearly as popular as they are<br/>
now.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
