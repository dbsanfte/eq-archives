<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-916582293">Suggestions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Stay under 15 pounds of<br/>
weight. The instant you hit 15 pounds.. get rid of<br/>
something or go sell. You lose your monk bonus AC. To give<br/>
ya an idea... some level 11 monk friend of mine<br/>
dropped 200+ AC points when he hit 15 lbs. (Something<br/>
like that)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Practice mend and Feign death<br/>
CONSTANTLY. You want to mend whenever it&#39;s available -- cause<br/>
before you master it.. it can cause you damage with crit<br/>
failures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feign death is important b/c it helps you with pulls...<br/>
monks often are given the role of puller and since they<br/>
do lotsa damage.. sometimes they need to feign death<br/>
just to get the mob back to the tank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also,<br/>
you&#39;ll want to practice Safe Fall. It&#39;s just too useful<br/>
in a variety of things. Running ragged from a pull<br/>
(SK aviaks come in mind-- monks with good safe fall<br/>
and feign rock as pullers).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) RP comes from<br/>
whatever you want to bring together as your monk. I play<br/>
very impish silly sorts with a sense of inner being.<br/>
That&#39;s why I always do something Elvish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
