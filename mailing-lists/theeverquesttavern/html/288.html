<div id="ygrps-yiv-19808881">Yeesh i am now cursing the way they did this,<br/>
first they force everyone lvl 45 and under out. Then<br/>
they make it much harder! so now all the high levels<br/>
are convinced that fear plane is too hard. That is<br/>
because there isnt enough people now to control the zone.<br/>
If they didnt have the lvl block so high i maybee<br/>
would have had a chance on some imbued plate *drools* I<br/>
hope they change this soon, or atleast fix kedge or<br/>
add some high 30s zones. Because those darn lvl 50s<br/>
are takin over all the good camp spots. I mean c&#39;mon<br/>
i hate hearing it when a druid says &quot;damn it! im<br/>
down to 3 haste sashes&quot; HOW FAIR IS THAT!? Oh well i<br/>
guess i can dream..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor, lvl 36,<br/>
