<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095707508">I am now a level 6 wizard and I am in GFay. I was<br/>
wondering where a good place for me to level up. I was in a<br/>
group of 6 and we went to CB and we tried to take on a<br/>
Lego. We didn&#39;t do very well. I am not getting much EXP<br/>
on orc hill either. Where should I go???</div>
