<div id="ygrps-yiv-56735848">A new video card may help. Something you might<br/>
want to try before spending 100-200 bucks on a new<br/>
card is increasing your computers virtual memory. I<br/>
bought a new computer and immediately upgraded it to 512<br/>
Ram. I still couldn&#39;t get on. I checked my virtual<br/>
memory and it was set very low. Typically, the virtual<br/>
memory&#39;s minimum level should be the amount of ram you<br/>
have, i.e. 320. The maximum should be set to twice<br/>
that. On Windows XP, you can change virtual memory by<br/>
selecting the system icon in the control panel...click on<br/>
the &quot;advanced&quot; tab. Under &quot;Performance&quot;, select<br/>
&quot;Settings.&quot; Choose &quot;Advanced&quot; Tab and change the vm from<br/>
there. Hope this helps!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tahksan - 17th Druid</div>
