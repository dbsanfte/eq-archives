<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946275889">Yes, eventually. For Rogues, however, Safe Fall<br/>
is capped at 94 skill or something. Still helps a<br/>
lot. I have jumped off of a Kelethin platform and<br/>
lived (forget how much damage I took). I also did a<br/>
flying leap off of the top deck on the big Kunark ship<br/>
for about 250 dam . . . Basically, Safe Fall reduces<br/>
the damage you would normally take. You can still<br/>
take damage, just not as much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saved my butt<br/>
from a Sand Giant once, too; I flew down a dune for<br/>
the zone, and made it. Realized later that I had<br/>
gotten some Safe Fall skill points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
