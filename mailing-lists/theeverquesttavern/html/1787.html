<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844449056">Some thoughts from a fellow Xev-ite who has died<br/>
many times in Unrest: I admit that ALL classes take<br/>
skill to master and know your role, though I favor the<br/>
casters, who i believe take more skill to be great at.<br/>
When you&#39;re a tank, please remember that YOU are the<br/>
one that decides when it&#39;s time to run-- casters have<br/>
no choice buy to fling thier noses in books in order<br/>
to be helpful, and don&#39;t always know what&#39;s going<br/>
on-- they SHOULD always be aware of your life bar,<br/>
though-- shame on the healer if he wasn&#39;t watching you<br/>
closely and didn&#39;t have enought wherewithall to target<br/>
you and heal. Many times, medding casters are out of<br/>
range, so they can&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; you being hit by the mobs,<br/>
and don&#39;t know if there&#39;s one or ten, unless you tell<br/>
them. Not saying this is what happened, but just<br/>
saying...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m with you on some points though-- I take my roles<br/>
seriously (main is druid, alt is mage), whether i&#39;m healer,<br/>
buffer, nuker, etc., and I hate being in groups with<br/>
people who don&#39;t understand thier specialty and master<br/>
it (ie. the tanking cleric, the Wizzie who<br/>
&quot;overnukes,&quot; so you have to waste heals on him and taunt off<br/>
him all the time, tanks who don&#39;t take on the<br/>
toughest mob or who fail to taunt off casters,<br/>
etc.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RR is a tough place, because most higher levels<br/>
train stuff through there when they get in trouble. A<br/>
werebat should not be a normal pull to the RR--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A<br/>
good group member is constructive and not negative--<br/>
remind the cleric, wizzie, or whoever what thier roll is<br/>
if they deviate (and if you know!). No caster class<br/>
should &quot;step in and take a hit&quot; for the tank. If the<br/>
tank needs that, the healer is not doing their job, or<br/>
the tank should be running to zone. (Exception-- I&#39;ve<br/>
done this a bunch as a druid--a well placed nuke will<br/>
agro and then I pray to Tunare that the cleric will<br/>
help and the tank will get back in line ASAP--if not,<br/>
i know when to run!!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sounds like your group<br/>
wasn&#39;t informed of the MA (Main Assist) theory of<br/>
fighting. If you are the MA, all should /assist you-- the<br/>
secondary tank should be ready to break off and taunt any<br/>
mob who agros on a caster. You should have a DS cast<br/>
on you, if available, and the healer should have you<br/>
targeted, unless someone else is in dire need. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last<br/>
thoughts-- if you had a mage, his/her pet could have taunted<br/>
the mob off you while you backed off. If you had a<br/>
druid, you&#39;d be SOW&#39;d, and the mob would be snared,<br/>
making it easy to get away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-- no matter how<br/>
mad you are at your casters, NEVER try to train the<br/>
mob on your own group to save yourself, like you did.<br/>
That is cowardly, and has gotten more than one tank on<br/>
Xev a bad reputation. Fight with honor and<br/>
compassion, and if your healer EVER heals a wizzard with 80h<br/>
again, get a new healer or a new group!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela<br/>
