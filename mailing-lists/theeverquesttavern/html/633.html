<div id="ygrps-yiv-889906080">Yes, groups like that suck royally. It really<br/>
sucks when you are semi-high level when people SHOULD<br/>
know there roll in the group. You designate a healer<br/>
and they waste precious mana nukeing or tanking,<br/>
nukers who waste nukes on greenies the tank can handle<br/>
=P all this results in a lot of wasted down time. If<br/>
you read my Cazic-Thule fighting reccomendations you<br/>
know that I only nuke once per lost tank bubble. Keeps<br/>
them from aggroing on me....most of the time. I also<br/>
use Screaming Terror on extras if I can get to them.<br/>
(mez spell) At level 33 my group had people who didn&#39;t<br/>
follow group proceedures ( a guy who wasn&#39;t the<br/>
desegnated puller pulling crap). I hear the tank say ZONE<br/>
(he was our evac caller) so I hit harmshield and ZOOM<br/>
out of the Tae room. I manage to zone, utterly oom<br/>
but with a full health bar, and the idiots in the<br/>
group yell at the tank and I for running (we lived they<br/>
didn&#39;t) sorry boys and girls but when the person we all<br/>
agree on to yell run actually assesses the situation<br/>
and knows we are going to die if we don&#39;t zone yells<br/>
run, then you better run! Hesitation will kill you AND<br/>
the tank who has to pause to save your ass while<br/>
telling you &quot;@(&*^@ I SAID ZONE!!!!&quot; Running isn&#39;t<br/>
fun....but better YOU die than me for your<br/>
stupidity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;well there is my rant =P~~~~~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next time your<br/>
friend pulls something you KNOW you can&#39;t take DON&#39;T hit<br/>
it! Tell him to run to the zone. If you don&#39;t touch<br/>
it, it won&#39;t aggro on you if you get out of the way.<br/>
It&#39;s no fun to watch a friend die but it&#39;s his own<br/>
fault.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aeday Femmefatel &lt;The Dark Lords&gt;&lt;br&gt;level 34<br/>
