<b>Subject:</b> Re: PLEASE Help, I keep getting booted a <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-719247073">Alright... 1st... define booted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Booted<br/>
from Server on EQ&lt;br&gt;2) Booted from ISP&lt;br&gt;3) Booted<br/>
from EQ Entirely&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it&#39;s Server, or EQ... you<br/>
might want to uninstall/reinstall EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOWEVER,<br/>
AOL 6.0 is notorious in most tech circles for being<br/>
really hard to hack out. I&#39;ve been told that sometimes--<br/>
if you get a tech that knows who&#39;s good at AOL-- you<br/>
can get them to registry hack for you. But the<br/>
problem is, trusting AOL for a registry<br/>
hack?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, did you delete AOL or did you uninstall AOL? It<br/>
does make a difference although AOL 6.0 almost makes<br/>
it a moot point-- as many registry entries as its<br/>
uninstall leaves behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is likely AOL<br/>
conflicting with Bellsouth if you&#39;re getting connection<br/>
boots. Also it could be possible Bellsouth has been set<br/>
to disconnect after 10 or 15 mins if you don&#39;t click<br/>
&quot;yes stay connected&quot;. There&#39;s the possibility that<br/>
that&#39;s coming up in the background and you can&#39;t see it<br/>
b/c of course EQ takes up everything and then you get<br/>
disconnected-- which of course punts you from EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope<br/>
some of this helps and you don&#39;t end up having to<br/>
Format, Reinstall. Course if you have WinME, just do a<br/>
system restore to before you had issues. ME has its<br/>
flaws but system restore rocks. ME allocates 400MBs to<br/>
System Restore and each restore table takes 3+kb AND you<br/>
can make up to 9 user restore points on any given day<br/>
(for a total of 10 in one day). Course it takes over<br/>
HDD&#39;s and puts itself in the boot sector, has a super<br/>
hidden io.sys that can&#39;t be deleted or even found in DOS<br/>
(try to derash it from a boot disk- gluck finding it--<br/>
can in versions up to Win2k though). It&#39;s hard to<br/>
crash completely though. If you know what you&#39;re doing,<br/>
you can deletely Hkey_Local registries and still fix<br/>
it without a format. Still, the fact that an<br/>
fdisk/format doesn&#39;t completely remove it from an HDD is a<br/>
bummer. (sorry. Have had to deal with the ups and downs<br/>
of ME for a while. Sigh/grin)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m<br/>
rambling. Gluck&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
