<b>Subject:</b> Re: [The EverQuest Tavern] New Guild Forming in Tribunal <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868478409">The Mageborn guild (unless the name is already taken)<br/>
is growing, but cannot be formed without YOUR help. <br/>
If you don&#39;t have a mage, it&#39;s okay, just start one. <br/>
We will be generally geared (at first) to low lvl<br/>
characters.  I am also working on developing a<br/>
charter.<br/>
<br/>
  We the Mageborn of Norrath hereby form this society<br/>
of elite, to bring power to the residents of Norrath. <br/>
Our great world has lived long enough under the thumb<br/>
of the Gods and Dragons of great infamy.  This era<br/>
shall be at an end.  Change shall rock this world to<br/>
its very fabric, and we shall form a new Norrath under<br/>
the guidance of the Mageborn senetors.<br/>
  1.  To be a member of the Mageborn one must be of<br/>
the class Mage.<br/>
  2.  Any policy of Mageborn may be ammended with a<br/>
3/4 senate vote.<br/>
  3.  Co-exist peacefully with the guilds of Norrath,<br/>
but afford them no special treatment, for no good deed<br/>
goes unrewarded.<br/>
  4.  To declare war upon a guild, a minimum of 10<br/>
members must be present and a 2/3 vote must be in<br/>
favor of these actions.<br/>
  5.  To become a member of the Mageborn Senate one<br/>
must be above the lvl of 20 and must be elected by a<br/>
popular vote.<br/>
  6.  In achieving this popular vote, one shall then<br/>
change his/her surname to Senator, that all may know<br/>
of this station.<br/>
  7.  Any complaints, made by the citizenry of<br/>
Norrath, shall be investigated, and any offender or<br/>
group therein shall be summarily court martialed by a<br/>
member of the senate and (a) warned (b) punished or<br/>
(c) removed from the guild.<br/>
<br/>
Well, its a work in progress, but so far its coming<br/>
along pretty well =P talk to you guys online  <br/>
<br/>
  Oh, PS the chat room will be named Mageborn and the<br/>
pass is dragonslayer, so if you see the chat room come<br/>
in and join.  Later all Psyko<br/>
  <br/>
