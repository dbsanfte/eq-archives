<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575951656">Twinking has never really bothered me, I try not<br/>
to be jealous of other folks goodies. If they feel<br/>
better by having better stuff, then I think they are<br/>
just compensating for inadequecy. If they use their<br/>
twinkings for the good of the group, then I am good with<br/>
it. I think that powerleveling is more disruptive<br/>
than twinking. When you get a level 20 warrior that<br/>
can&#39;t taunt, or a cleric that doesn&#39;t know about<br/>
certain beneficial spells (stun and fear come to mind) or<br/>
a bard that is still singing the level 1 song (or<br/>
better yet, never bought any), then you find yourself<br/>
getting killed because of idiocy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf</div>
