<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509797355">I&#39;ll add to the good comments already made-- I<br/>
always ask before I jump in-- UNLESS it&#39;s obvious that<br/>
the person needs help. (But even then, you may be<br/>
helping a Pally who had LoH and didn&#39;t want help!!). If<br/>
someone gives a train shout, it is more often a warning<br/>
AND a cry for help with the train. If someone doesn&#39;t<br/>
shout, they either are being rude to those about to get<br/>
trained (or...gasp!!.. doing it on purpose??), or are<br/>
pulliing the train to take it on (usually with a group<br/>
that&#39;s nearby). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s my question-- what zones<br/>
have the biggest or scariest or toughest trains?? At<br/>
lower levels, not much compares to BlackBurrow-- the<br/>
gnoll trains from below, to the zone, can be huge. I&#39;ve<br/>
been in Unrest for a few weeks now, and I&#39;ve not seen<br/>
more deadly trains. When you&#39;re camping in the Round<br/>
Room, and all of the sudden you see dozens of mobs and<br/>
realize that there are ghouls, darkbone skellys, drybone<br/>
skellys, barbed skellys, carrion ghouls, skeletal monks--<br/>
and then you notice a few dusty werebats, an animated<br/>
hand and a festering hag come in-- UGH!! time to run<br/>
to the zone and give tons of shouts!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am<br/>
bound in Dagnar&#39;s Caludron, just at the ent to Unrest.<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll log on, and there will be 20 or more<br/>
characters there, in various states of undress and health.<br/>
BIG train got pulled and nearly everyon in the zone<br/>
either died or had to zone out. If you go to Unrest,<br/>
make sure you know if someone is hunting for the<br/>
ghost, and make sure that they&#39;re competent. More times<br/>
than not, ghost groups seem to pull the entire house<br/>
out to the zone. I&#39;ve died in Unrest more than in any<br/>
other zone (including those early days in GFay and CB),<br/>
but it was worth it because of the friends I made<br/>
there and the adventures!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serrafina</div>
