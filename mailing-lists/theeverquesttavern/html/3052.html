By Julie Shields - WeNews correspondent<br/>
<br/>
(WOMENSENEWS)--Now is the perfect time to go back to the roots of <br/>
Father&#39;s Day in the United States and celebrate and support what is <br/>
called &quot;involved fatherhood.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Few know that Father&#39;s Day in this country arose out of a daughter&#39;s <br/>
desire to honor her father, a widowed single Dad who raised six <br/>
children--including a - newborn--on a Spokane, Wash., farm. Sonora <br/>
Smart Dodd, so the story goes, heard a Mother&#39;s Day sermon in 1909 <br/>
and wondered why fathers like hers were not similarly celebrated. In <br/>
1910, Dodd organized the first such celebration in Spokane on June <br/>
19, a date she chose because her father was born in June. Dodd <br/>
believed her father courageous and strong because he made sacrifices <br/>
and behaved selflessly while she and her siblings grew up.<br/>
<br/>
In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge advocated for a national father&#39;s <br/>
day to help establish better relations between fathers and children <br/>
and to remind fathers of their responsibilities. In 1966, Lyndon <br/>
Johnson proclaimed the third Sunday in June a national holiday, <br/>
making it official.<br/>
<br/>
This Father&#39;s Day, we should support fathers who have followed in the <br/>
footsteps of William Jackson Smart, Dodd&#39;s father. We sit on top of <br/>
what could be a watershed moment in fatherhood. All kinds of evidence <br/>
document a zeitgeist shift for modern fathers. The recession and <br/>
altered views about men, women and work bring us to a point where <br/>
real economic and family change can occur--and has occurred--quickly.<br/>
