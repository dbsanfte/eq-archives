<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616722596">I play a HE druid, and I love Kan to bits, except<br/>
for the fact that she has low wis. At 35, I&#39;m at 139<br/>
wis, which I think is pitiful. My equip is about<br/>
standard for a non-twinked lvl 35. I say, go for it! It<br/>
may be a tough first character to play, but once you<br/>
know what EQ is all about, more difficult race/class<br/>
combos are all about variety. For example, I have a wood<br/>
elf warrior who loves trade skills. But you can do<br/>
whatever you want. If you want a HE druid, make one! No<br/>
one can stop you, and if it is too hard, you can make<br/>
a new character and build on what you learned. Good<br/>
hunting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanissa Noryk of Norraths Keepers&lt;br&gt;(Half elf!) Druid of<br/>
Tunare for 35 Seasons&lt;br&gt;Rodcet Nife</div>
