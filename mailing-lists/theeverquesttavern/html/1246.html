<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542746135">Hi everyone,I&#39;m new(You&#39;ve probably heard this<br/>
480 times though)I&#39;m a level 9(extremely close to<br/>
10)High Elf,Cleric on Prexus.It feel I&#39;ve been killing<br/>
centurions and slavers for eternity,and I&#39;m level 9!I really<br/>
can&#39;t imagine how I could get to level 60 without<br/>
loosing my mind.Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t like Everquest though<br/>
cause it&#39;s the best game I&#39;ve ever played!Are any of<br/>
you on the highest level? I recently took a boat to<br/>
the East Commonlands cause orcs weren&#39;t giving me<br/>
enough exp on level 9. I still don&#39;t know my way around<br/>
that well but I know to look out for...whatare they<br/>
called...oh yeah Griffins.A group I was in got mauled by them<br/>
but I casted Divine Aura and ran like the wind! My<br/>
bro plays EQ too and he&#39;s a Level 27 Troll,Shadow<br/>
Knight on Cazic-Thule.Last I saw he&#39;s fightin&#39; treants.<br/>
Sorry fer speaking so much I&#39;m just pretty bored right<br/>
now.See ya!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dreevil&lt;br&gt;High Elf&lt;br&gt;Cleric,Level<br/>
9&lt;br&gt;Prexus</div>
