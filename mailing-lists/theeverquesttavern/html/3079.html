&gt; Hi all....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope you&#39;re all very well!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just brought a second-hand EverQuest game....couldn&#39;t wait to get<br/>
&gt; home and join the fun...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then it happened the Cd key number doesn&#39;t work! (aaaaa!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anybody know what I can do to make it work or does anybody know<br/>
&gt; of any numbers that do work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Find the person that you got the game from and get your money back.  They&#39;ve<br/>
scammed you.<br/>
<br/>
The CD Key is tied to the account that was created by the person that used<br/>
the game before you.  Once it&#39;s been used, it can&#39;t be used again.</div>
