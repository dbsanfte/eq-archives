<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046994496">had a litle fun tonight. I didn&#39;t like my Human<br/>
Necro that much, mainley because he was in Qeynos.. I<br/>
can live.. (well die most of the time) with all the<br/>
KOS you get but the city lacked appeal from the Necro<br/>
point of view. Let&#39;s face it crawling around sewers<br/>
just isn&#39;t my style. Also I just can&#39;t find a real<br/>
affinety with the Bertoxxulous deity making roleplay a big<br/>
no no. &lt;br&gt;So I decieded to delete the character and<br/>
create a new one, this time in Freeport following<br/>
Innoruuk... So far nothing to funny right? :) Well the first<br/>
thing I did was NOT going to look up my guild, but<br/>
going to Nektulos. I didn&#39;t encounter any bears or<br/>
skellies on my way thank Innoruuk, and made it al the way<br/>
to the city. Guards conned my Dubiosly.&lt;br&gt;So I<br/>
decieded to go inside and see How far I could go. To my<br/>
suprice i could go all the way to 3th gate. The only ones<br/>
not liking me where the Ghouls at the entrance of the<br/>
lodge of the dead. &lt;br&gt;So I had to make some money and<br/>
ask somebody to buy the spell Invis. VS Undead for<br/>
me... Which nobody wanted to do because I was Human...<br/>
(normally they never roleplay but if I need a favor they<br/>
suddendly ALL do). So i logged of and back on as my main<br/>
char. Yargon, DE SK. I asked around through the guild<br/>
channel this time and after A litle while got somebody to<br/>
help. I bought a cracked staff and the first lvl spells<br/>
put them in a backpack and had them given to My newby<br/>
Necro Nebulos. I also had secured a bind in the city in<br/>
the mean time.&lt;br&gt;And I must say it&#39;s been a blast..<br/>
I hardly have come around to some leveling because<br/>
I got to answer questions all the time... &quot;Taught<br/>
humans where KOS here?&quot;and stuff like that :)&lt;br&gt;Yup it<br/>
feels nice being a litle uniqe in the EQ world :P I<br/>
know most have nevert seen a naked lvl1 necro running<br/>
around in Nektulos before :P</div>
