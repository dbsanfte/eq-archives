<b>Subject:</b> Stats for a char <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585739952">Hmm..ok here&#39;s a question then? Since I know that<br/>
I will be playing within a month to two months I<br/>
need to have a char, just in case my others are wiped<br/>
out. So I am thinking Enchanter, Druid and yes the all<br/>
around basher Warrior. My question is this then. When<br/>
you start the char they ask you to put the points in,<br/>
so what is a good distrubition of these stats for<br/>
each char type listed here? Also for these char thypes<br/>
what are the better races? (I know for war the best is<br/>
Troll &#39;cause they get regen, but the faction sucks so I<br/>
might just go with Human.) Hmm..can&#39;t think of anything<br/>
else so I guess I&#39;ll go for now. *yawn* have to get up<br/>
early for work tomorrow. Night. The Raven</div>
