<div id="ygrps-yiv-307534536">Whoa, Jasmy, no freaking way! I can&#39;t believe<br/>
you&#39;re here. Too cool. Haven&#39;t seen you in a while - my<br/>
EQ time is erratic, what with college getting in the<br/>
way :). I just got to lv 12 tonight, hunted the gnoll<br/>
commander/elite gnoll room in BB with some capable if not greedy<br/>
friends. I got some rad equipment - I&#39;m in full banded<br/>
now. Also, this one really cool necromancer, Gixon,<br/>
who&#39;s probably at lv 50 by now, hooked me up. He gave<br/>
me a fine steel two-handed sword, which I&#39;m using<br/>
now. He also gave me a bronze helm and a Qeynos kite<br/>
shield and gave me about 100 pp, all for just some bone<br/>
chips. He is too cool. Anyway, long time no see -<br/>
perhaps we shall run into each other<br/>
again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Half-elf warrior of 12 seasons&lt;br&gt;Prexus</div>
