<div id="ygrps-yiv-198450238">Fanarian, when i read that u are a level 30 druid<br/>
and you still have leather armor my mouth fell wide<br/>
open. U at least have a Split paw vest don&#39;t u? Or<br/>
maybe a Lockjaw vest? I got all the spilt paw armor<br/>
before lvl 12, and i got a Lockjaw vest at lvl 14. My<br/>
druid as if of right now is lvl 16, 1/2 of a bbl to 17.<br/>
Maybe u consider these leather, but i don&#39;t. Also u<br/>
said that u have alot of Wis items. Tell me, what can<br/>
i get that is for 200pp or under for wis items. I<br/>
have goo ring and bracers. Also i traded a PBB(given<br/>
to me for free) for 2 bracers that were +10HP +10<br/>
manna each. was this a good deal, or did i get riped<br/>
off.</div>
