<div id="ygrps-yiv-553901863">LOL... every so often I do my various<br/>
posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First of all... human monk vs Iskar monk. Let me do<br/>
this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Human monk&#39;s advantage-- can travel in a lot of<br/>
areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskars are pretty limited on cities and banks.&lt;br&gt;1)<br/>
Iskars regen faster and usually deal a bit more damage<br/>
than humans&lt;br&gt;2) Iskars see a bit better and swim at<br/>
master levels starting out.&lt;br&gt;3) Iskar monks get forage<br/>
starting out.&lt;br&gt;4) Iskar monks start with dual wield. (I<br/>
forget if human monks do or not. But they sure<br/>
do.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alright, now Necro vs SK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given 2 mins prep time to<br/>
prep each other... necro wins every time. Now this all<br/>
is assuming PVP spells are memmed rather than Party<br/>
spells. Necro&#39;s have a bigger pet, can slow and dot, and<br/>
fear better. The SK has HT but that&#39;s not going to<br/>
save him if the necro fears, slows, and dots him well.<br/>
Plus necro&#39;s have a bunch of other utility spells.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now this all is assuming certain things. I&#39;m not a<br/>
PVP player so I could play a Necro (which is also a<br/>
class I don&#39;t like playing) and get smoked by an SK.<br/>
This is assuming equal levels of knowledge of PVP,<br/>
preparation, and levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Course, an SK with a lot of<br/>
pumices and other things might not lose... it&#39;s just<br/>
he&#39;ll have to be better at playing than the necro.<br/>
(Hey, if a Warrior can win 8 in a Tournament at a Con--<br/>
you know any class can win. Warriors are supposed--<br/>
supposed-- to be the worse pvp. And yes, PVP stinks to group<br/>
with in Non-pvp servers.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
