<div id="ygrps-yiv-687880709">Well, finally something interesting happened on<br/>
sleepy Drinal last night. I had this urge to visit<br/>
Lesser Faydark, so I zoned in . . . and found the body<br/>
of an Undead Sprite Horror. Asked the people<br/>
standing around if it was theirs -- yup, and they&#39;re<br/>
nasty. About 10 seconds later, another Undead Sprite<br/>
Horror shows up, and a Brownie as well. By the time I<br/>
collected my wits, it was LOADING, PLEASE WAIT . .<br/>
.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I got back to the zone entrance, someone else<br/>
(also waiting to do a corpse recovery) suggested it was<br/>
a GM event. I though it might have to do with the<br/>
coming war . . . The sky was red, and as I walked<br/>
through LFaydark, I saw MANY Undead Sprites, Sprite<br/>
Spooks, and Sprite Horrors. I love Sneak/Hide with<br/>
SoW.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Didn&#39;t find anything interesting, however, and the sky<br/>
cleared up at about 1:00 a.m. Pacific time or<br/>
thereabouts. Anyone have any idea what was going on? Is this<br/>
related to the war, or something else? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On another<br/>
note, will a 12th level character be able to do<br/>
anything other than hide in this war?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
