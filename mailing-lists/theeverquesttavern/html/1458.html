<div id="ygrps-yiv-846200982">South Karana and Hipass are both very good ideas<br/>
if you choose to stay on Anatonica. If you decide to<br/>
see what is in Kunark...you should be just fine in<br/>
Overthere. If you take the raft from Oasis to Timorous Deep,<br/>
it will take you to an island (Ogre Isle is what we<br/>
always called it.) You may need to camo up, but since<br/>
you are a druid, there&#39;s no problem there. Get off<br/>
the raft and go right...stay close to the rock wall,<br/>
but evade any ogres. You&#39;ll see the shore on the<br/>
other side of the rock...go to the dock area nearest to<br/>
the rock. A large boat will come here- I don&#39;t recall<br/>
the name, sorry. Get on the large boat and this will<br/>
zone you into Overthere. Turn your clip plane up so<br/>
you can see details far away. If you stand on the<br/>
left side of the boat, you will soon see a large wall<br/>
in the distance. Since Overthere is an evil outpost,<br/>
you will need to jump off the boat as you get closer<br/>
to the wall. DON&#39;T GO TO THE DOCK! You will die- if<br/>
you aren&#39;t evil that is. If your swimming is poor I<br/>
suggest bringing fish scales for enduring breath (but<br/>
it&#39;s really not a far swim.) Once you can see the<br/>
wall, swim to the edge of it...the left side as you<br/>
look at it from the boat. You will notice that it juts<br/>
out of the land...there is land on both sides. Ok,<br/>
this is important. On the right of the wall- nearest<br/>
the boat and dock....there is a hill, a small open<br/>
area. This is a bind point. It is the only place where<br/>
you can bind. Do so, it will make it a shorter trip<br/>
if you die. Kunark zones are quite large and there<br/>
is enough area to cover running without having to<br/>
ride the boat too for a CR. Now that you are bound,<br/>
swim to the other side of the wall. As a druid, there<br/>
is a lot of open space here...good kiting grounds.<br/>
But beware, there are areas with higher level Sarnaks<br/>
that will slap you silly. Check maps online that list<br/>
mobs and locs so that you can get a gist of the zone.<br/>
There is a large cliff there...Don&#39;t fall off as you&#39;re<br/>
trying to auto run and hold a converstion. That could be<br/>
very messy. Find the loc of the Warslik woods zone.<br/>
There is a huge statue near the zone that is a great<br/>
landmark and makes for a great pulling area. If you can<br/>
get a group together...this is a good spot and it is<br/>
near the zone in case things get hectic. For the way<br/>
home- for your ranger friend since he/she can&#39;t gate<br/>
and you are a ways from your group ports, bring a<br/>
stack of bat wings so that you have them handy for<br/>
levitate. Just head back to the bind area and wait til you<br/>
see the boat...get everyone that is heading home a<br/>
lev and it is MUCH easier to get on the boat. If you<br/>
have to swim it can be difficult to keep up with the<br/>
boat or figure out how to climb up the barrels to get<br/>
on. With lev, you just walk right on it. This time,<br/>
stay on the right side of the boat (away from the KOS<br/>
docks of course.) Sit and rest til you get to Ogre<br/>
island and just back track back to the other side of the<br/>
rock to where the raft comes (there is no marker, but<br/>
it is kinda by a palm tree.) Then that takes you<br/>
home to Oasis. Good luck and I hope this helps. I know<br/>
it wrote a lot, but I remember how nervous I was the<br/>
first time I made this trip and I was trying to get<br/>
instructions in game. It can be quite confusing and is a lot<br/>
to remember.</div>
