Caverns.  madd xp there  from 22 to 26.  i did that with <br/>
my Shaman who is now lvl 26. Now I gotta find a good <br/>
place for him to level up to at least  35<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I am back from a four month hiatus because of a move. Since I am back <br/>
&gt; with the game and I have yet to find my EQ books and that notes that <br/>
&gt; are sitll pack away somewhere, I am looking for a place to send my <br/>
&gt; lvl 22 Shammie Barb for a good hunt. My character right now is in E. <br/>
&gt; Commonlands. Any advice or suggestions would be helpful as I get back <br/>
&gt; into the game. Thanks for your help.<br/>
