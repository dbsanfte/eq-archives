<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170329992">You are absolutly right those new things you are seeing dropping <br/>
everywhere are for the Newbie Armor quest that almost every class <br/>
and every race has now (specially in Qeynos where you couldn&#39;t get <br/>
an armor quest and Surefall Glade).<br/>
The NPC that give instructions on how to make armor and what to <br/>
collect are right in your class guild, just remember most newbie <br/>
armors are class/race specific..So if you are a Wood Elf Druid  <br/>
don&#39;t expect to make and use the Halfling Drid Armor wich is <br/>
HLf/Druid only. Just my 2cp.<br/>

&gt; Ok so it&#39;s been quite a few many months since I was able to play <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; a regular basis. (How I did it with a regular phone connection <br/>
I&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; never know!) Anyway, now that I am playing I have noticed a LOT of <br/>
&gt; new stuff. My lvl 10 (now) Ench was playing in Black Burrow in the <br/>
&gt; wee hours this morning and I kept getting Ruined Gnoll Leather <br/>
stuff <br/>
&gt; (like gloves, wristbands etc...) Someone said that this is for a <br/>
&gt; Druid, Ranger quest? If this is does anyone know how it works? I <br/>
ask <br/>
&gt; czause I have a druid and I&#39;d like to get her some decent stuff <br/>
&gt; maybe. Anyway, thanks for the info if you have it. The Raven </span></blockquote></div>
