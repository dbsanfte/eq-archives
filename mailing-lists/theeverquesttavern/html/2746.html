<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752408091">Hail,<br/>
<br/>
I have been at this stoopid game for close to 3 years. My crowning <br/>
achievement so far (150 days played, cause I love to &#39;smell the <br/>
flowers&#39;) is lvl 60 epiced shaman with complete spellbook<br/>
(no &#39;Ancient Scrolls&#39; yet) and 25 AA pts. Even after playing EQ for <br/>
this amount of time there is so much I am unfamiliar with, mostly the <br/>
old world, feel like newbie often :)<br/>
<br/>
I do however have humble knowledge of the Barbarian Shaman class, the <br/>
continent of Antonica and many of the kunark and velious zones. I <br/>
hang out mostly in luclin zones atm. I belong to a smallish guild (60 <br/>
members) that I have been in for 2 years (since early 30&#39;s) we are <br/>
just now approaching some of the higher end encounters.<br/>
<br/>
I know I will learn from you folks and hopefully be able to <br/>
contribute in some humble manner.<br/>
