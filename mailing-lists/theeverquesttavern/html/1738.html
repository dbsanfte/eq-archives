<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718936048">Well, many times a tank will ignore a<br/>
caster/healer&#39;s frantic shouts if he&#39;s about to bring the<br/>
creature he&#39;s currently fighting down. I&#39;m not saying this<br/>
is right or wrong, but in many cases that is the way<br/>
they work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m curious, how big was your group,<br/>
and what other classes were there? If it was just you<br/>
and the tank, then you should have run for the hills<br/>
when he overpulled.</div>
