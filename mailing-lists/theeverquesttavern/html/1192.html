<div id="ygrps-yiv-350762092">Hello Everyone! I&#39;m glad to see this board is<br/>
still very active and popular. Everquest sure isn&#39;t in<br/>
its golden days anymore, but it still is addictive<br/>
and fun for us hardcore gamers. I haven&#39;t gotten my<br/>
hands on velious yet, but am looking forward to seeing<br/>
the icey wastes very soon. I&#39;ve given the board a new<br/>
look, and will most likely be changing it every season.<br/>
A main website for this will be up fairly soon, as<br/>
well as a fresh board, made with EZboard<br/>
(www.ezboard.com) I&#39;m looking for ideas, so don&#39;t hesitate to<br/>
post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;hmmm...i need to do some cleaning up in the images<br/>
section, although i will be keeping Athex_x&#39;s and<br/>
Gillerins images up. Those were originally taken during<br/>
EverQuest&#39;s beta testing period and are classic to me =) I&#39;m<br/>
looking for everquest artwork, and would love to see some<br/>
nice stuff. I&#39;m starting to work on a comic about my<br/>
character, Kaylin&#39;s life, so be on the look out for updates<br/>
on that, as well as samples in the pcictures<br/>
section. Anyway, I&#39;m getting random...so i&#39;ll see you all<br/>
in game!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor&lt;br&gt;55<br/>
