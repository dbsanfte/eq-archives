<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079104007">Hail all of Norrath,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I am serious about<br/>
RP as well as lvling equally I am a lvl 12 SK in<br/>
serch of others dedicated to srious rp ie designating<br/>
enemy and allied guilds locking a campsite ,with good<br/>
loot and expo for a day guild wars ecetera. I am on<br/>
Drinal and have played on other servers and I must say<br/>
fair ones I hate Drinal this is for the soloer. I have<br/>
been on others such as Tribunal and Bertoxx and have<br/>
found many who indulge deeply in the REAL rp aspect.Now<br/>
forgive me If I sound whiny but isnt this the purpose of<br/>
the game?&lt;br&gt;I seek to either join or create a guild<br/>
strting around lvl 12- 18. Guilds purpose is more of a<br/>
Chaotic Evil approach ie friends dear and enemies<br/>
dearer.So please if anyone has a slot in a solid rp Guild<br/>
that will help me to get both my lvl Hi and my chef<br/>
skills equally hi E me If not those of you equally<br/>
frustrated with a soso server of Drinal e me so that we may<br/>
start a legacy beyond beyond.</div>
