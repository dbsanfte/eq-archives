<div id="ygrps-yiv-320167861">Hola, Melefante.<br/>
<br/>
Think about going to Oasis too. Nice place. I spent most of my teens there. Never a shortage of people to group with and really large level span. Just watch out for the Spectors, SG&#39;s and Lockjaw :)<br/>

&gt;been. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1-9, or so - Greater Faydark/Crushbone, doing the orcs and Ranger <br/>
&gt;Newbie armor quests.  Why&#39;d you relocate to Qeynos, anyway?  Our <br/>
&gt;(Wood Elf) armor and weapon quests are all centered in GFay.  But now <br/>
&gt;that you&#39;re 12, they may not be worth doing.  <br/>
&gt;9-11 - Ocean of Tears, kiling Alluring Sirens.  Jump off the boat at <br/>
&gt;either set of islands between Butcherblock and Freeport. You&#39;ll see <br/>
&gt;the Sirens.  Watch out for the Goblins, too.<br/>
&gt;12-13 - Steamfont, collecting micro servers for the Trueshot quest <br/>
&gt;later on<br/>
&gt;14-current - Nybright sisters in Lesser Faydark.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After this I&#39;m headed to the Warrens, but am going to wait for Dual <br/>
&gt;Wield at 17.  Hate to get out there, then have to go someplace else <br/>
&gt;to train.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do have a very good weapon, which makes some of this a bit easier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this helps.<br/>
