<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-162175628">Hm, I think the whole gift area is kinda gray. I<br/>
don&#39;t consider it twinking per se, unless you&#39;re<br/>
getting a LOT. I got a BCP from a friend once, and some<br/>
guy I didn&#39;t know once gave me 300pp. Personally, I<br/>
feel that as long as the gifts are small and few<br/>
between, it&#39;s not twinking. However, if a friend is giving<br/>
you tons of stuff, I wouldn&#39;t like it. But I&#39;ve been<br/>
thinking lately, and I&#39;ll have to say, to each his own. I<br/>
don&#39;t like twinks, since they ruin the point of the<br/>
game for me. To me, you&#39;re supposed to be kinda<br/>
self-reliant, and work your own way up. Getting huge boosts<br/>
like that are detrimental, IMHO. But I&#39;ll never refuse<br/>
a gift. ;) What really annoys me is when you see a<br/>
lvl 4 warrior trying to sell a wurmslayer, which *I*<br/>
can&#39;t afford.&lt;br&gt;Kinda a long post, sorry, all.&lt;br&gt;Hey,<br/>
Calidiel, if you ever see me on, give me a /tell some time.<br/>
You&#39;ll probably catch up to me soon; maybe we can group<br/>
sometime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanissa Noryk of Norraths Keepers&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 35th<br/>
