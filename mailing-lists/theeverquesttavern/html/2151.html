<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575457579">Hi Everyone!! I just wanted to let you all know<br/>
that I&#39;ve created a club especially for the Evil<br/>
players on Sullon Zek. I noticed there wasn&#39;t one yet and<br/>
there&#39;s so much to talk about! So if you play on Sullon<br/>
Zek and happen to believe in an Evil God, check it<br/>
out at<br/>
&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/sullonzekevilalliance">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/sullonzekevilalliance</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/sullonzekevilalliance&lt;/a">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/sullonzekevilalliance&lt;/a</a>&gt; I&#39;m not trying to take members away from this<br/>
club. I like this club a lot and have so many<br/>
characters on different servers that I need some grounding,<br/>
so I always end up coming back here. ^_^ Well I hope<br/>
you all are having a great day! Keep on supporting<br/>
EQ!</div>
