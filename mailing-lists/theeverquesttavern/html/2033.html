<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-724722145">From time to time I have found that I got board<br/>
of eq. I found that I was hunting and killing and<br/>
being killed and getting no where. My main char that I<br/>
feel that I get no where with is my level 51 chanter<br/>
he has been 51 for like 5 or 6 months now. Its like<br/>
I hunt for 3 hours to get one blue exp bar and then<br/>
I die and lose that time. When I start to feel this<br/>
way I either play my alts or I just dont play<br/>
eq.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also about the friend thing I have this one friend who<br/>
can level his chars from level 1 to 20 in like one<br/>
week. I call him a power gamer because when he wants to<br/>
level he can. He out levles all my guys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also<br/>
when I used to play eq I couldnt wait to get on. Now I<br/>
dont have that feeling anymore I still play but not<br/>
nearly as much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for people leaving eq there<br/>
are some new games comming out DAoC for one. I know<br/>
when WoW comes out I might start playing that. But I<br/>
think I still might keep my eq account just to keep in<br/>
touch with friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien</div>
