<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268085391">Greetings, Scaled One . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funny you<br/>
should ask -- I&#39;ve just started a character on SZ. But<br/>
I&#39;m pretty much the opposite of you; I started a Good<br/>
(Human) Cleric. I suspect we&#39;d have to try to hurt each<br/>
other if we met in-game (although I&#39;d certainly offer a<br/>
truce to anyone from this club!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, yes, it<br/>
is much different. I haven&#39;t gotten to the<br/>
PvP-capable level yet, but that doesn&#39;t stop people from<br/>
trying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as I&#39;ve heard, for melees in PvP it&#39;s all<br/>
about getting Magic Resistance equipment. If you can<br/>
withstand a spell, you have a much better chance of getting<br/>
in close. Range weapons will help, if you can time<br/>
it to interrupt casting, too. But the big drawback<br/>
is that you don&#39;t have any form of Snare or Root,<br/>
which is what most PvP&#39;s start off with,<br/>
evidently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I applaud you for trying something hard. I&#39;ve<br/>
been told that Clerics are kind of useless for PvP,<br/>
since they have very little in the way of non-magical<br/>
offensive skills (see the MR note above). Their biggest<br/>
advantage is that they&#39;re hard to kill, because of their<br/>
healing abilities. Many times, folks just give up, as the<br/>
Cleric stands there and heals himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I intend<br/>
to be a necromancer-hunter. I figure that my<br/>
anti-undead spells would be good for that. We&#39;ll<br/>
see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leofric, Kharlisht&#39;s alter-ego on Sullon Zek</div>
