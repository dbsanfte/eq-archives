&gt;  But make sure a few times that the GM will be there.  They<br/>
&gt; dont keep records of this stuff so petition and make sure that the Gm<br/>
&gt; you are talking to can personally do the service.<br/>

done, as long as you petition early enough in advance (one week).  That<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that they will always be able to do a wedding, though.  If<br/>
there are a lot of petitions (and not many guides on), they aren&#39;t going to<br/>
stop just to do a wedding, even if it was scheduled.<br/>
