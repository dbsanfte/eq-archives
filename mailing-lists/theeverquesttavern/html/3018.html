&gt; Hello all, here is an everquest question. I have a<br/>
&gt; 46th level ranger and soon I will be hitting 50th<br/>
&gt; level and my alternet advancement ( I hope I got the<br/>
&gt; spelling right) will kick in, I&#39;m not sure how to<br/>
&gt; handle the points when I have the ability to add them,<br/>
&gt; I wanted too know if there is a site I can go to that<br/>
&gt; will let me know which ones I should use for a ranger.<br/>
<br/>

Anything you wanted to know (or ask) about being a Ranger.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, unless you hunt heavily in dungeons, it&#39;s probably best to forget about AA <br/>
points until 55, if not all the way to 60.  If you do hunt in dungeons a lot, <br/>
then getting 3 points in Run Speed is probably a wise investment.  I&#39;ve always <br/>
been of the belief that levels are greater than AA points.<br/>
<br/>
I waited until 60 to start AA&#39;s.  I did 8 AA points at 61 before I was flagged <br/>
for Tier 2 PoP Planes.  After getting flagged, I went straight to 65.  I&#39;m <br/>
happy to be finished leveling.  :)<br/>
