<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867967483">Yow, I hope you mean in EQ . . . but I suspect<br/>
not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I seem to be unable to stay away from this issue,<br/>
just wanted to point out that I agree, it&#39;s the 50th<br/>
level character twinking his 1st or 2nd level character<br/>
that&#39;s annoying. That&#39;s what started me on this whole<br/>
thing over on the Everlore Rogue board. It was just the<br/>
attitude of the guy that got under my skin -- &quot;How should<br/>
I twink my little rogey?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, now I know why<br/>
I can&#39;t stay away from this discussion -- I&#39;m away<br/>
from home this week and haven&#39;t played in FOUR DAYS.<br/>
I&#39;m jonesin&#39; something severe . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, but<br/>
one more thing, this on alts and mains. I have a<br/>
couple of alts, just a coupe of 2nd levels. But I&#39;m<br/>
actually thinking of giving up on them -- it seems it<br/>
would be more fun to experience everything Norrath has<br/>
to offer through the eyes of my main character. I<br/>
started a Dwarf Paladin, and it wasn&#39;t as fun to<br/>
&quot;discover&quot; Kaladim as it had been with my main character,<br/>
because I knew the place already. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This might just<br/>
be a matter of how deeply I identify with Dwarf<br/>
Rogues/Thieves (the class I always played in D&D). But no,<br/>
that&#39;s not odd or anything . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
Kaladim&lt;br&gt;11th season Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
