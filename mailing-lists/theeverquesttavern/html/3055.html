 <br/>
You Know You RP Too Much When...<br/>
You spend the weekends online.<br/>
<br/>
You finally break yourself from the computer to get a job...Just to buy<br/>
Anime and video games.<br/>
<br/>
You screw the working part and just leech off from your parents.<br/>
<br/>
...And you&#39;re 21 and still living in their house.<br/>
<br/>
You find yourself day-dreaming battles and epics.<br/>
<br/>
You constantly have an RP romance.<br/>
<br/>
Y0u c4n und3r574nd 7h15<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re a chronic user of showing symbols to relay emotions. [ :D ]<br/>
<br/>
You drool over an anime character&#39;s monstrously large eyes.<br/>
<br/>
You refer to reality as &quot;the outside.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Worse yet - you refer to it as the Matrix.<br/>
<br/>
You can only speak your mind using text.<br/>
<br/>
Your handwriting is complete shit.<br/>
<br/>
You can type 120 words per minute.<br/>
<br/>
...And you&#39;re lucky to even have 10% accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re a mage and have found yourself searching wiccan sites for cool &quot;real&quot;<br/>
spells to make you the shit inside of the chat.<br/>
<br/>
You pick on newbies and call them &quot;child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You squander your money on subbed anime tapes. Screw the need for food!<br/>
<br/>
You get by on the comfort that someday your online hottie and you will meet.<br/>
<br/>
You cry during GundamWing.<br/>
<br/>
After spending a weekend offline you come back and make a vow to never again<br/>
leave when you miss out on all the &quot;adventures.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You consider yourself to have a life.<br/>
<br/>
You look up to Goku as a role model.<br/>
<br/>
You look down on Vejita for being an ass, then inwardly remark about what an<br/>
ass he has.<br/>
<br/>
You can speak Japanese. And boast that quite loudly.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re a twelve year old girl and can not only write, speak and understand<br/>
Japanese, but you&#39;re also failing every course in school for spending so<br/>
much time and effort on memorization.<br/>
<br/>
You believe that the Sailor Scouts actually rule each of the planets and are<br/>
somehow the intricate masters to the universe.<br/>
<br/>
You probably can&#39;t use &quot;you&#39;re&quot; and &quot;they&#39;re&quot; correctly 9 times outta 10.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re heralded more as a somebody on the internet and inside of a chat than<br/>
you are inside of your own family.<br/>
<br/>
You create your own family.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re married at 12 to a Majin Vejita who&#39;s 18 and horny.<br/>
<br/>
You love him despite the fact he flirts openly with that Usagi and stares at<br/>
Faye.<br/>
<br/>
You draw yourself often.<br/>
<br/>
You create stories revolving around your character.<br/>
<br/>
....You post them up on the internet and expect everybody to give a damn.<br/>
<br/>
You have a permanent butt mark within the seat of your chair.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re either a chibi or dark and attempting to be mysterious. There is no<br/>
between.<br/>
<br/>
When taking real life matters and using side remarks inside of a dire<br/>
situation of a drama, you do eveything with a (( )) .<br/>
<br/>
You think that J-Pop music is the shit.<br/>
<br/>
You actually talk in the third person too much and use brackets to relay<br/>
what in the hell you&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
...You were teased for using &quot;you&quot; and &quot;me&quot; and jeered as not RPing right.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re so much of a pervert that you skip watching porno and instead stock<br/>
up on hentai.<br/>
<br/>
...And you&#39;re a female.<br/>
<br/>
You have more friends online than you do &quot;in real life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You vehemently stick up for an Anime / Video game love, and act like you<br/>
totally understand where he&#39;s coming from and all that jazz. <br/>

Caution! I halt for gnomes, elves, leprechans, unicorns, pixies, faeries,<br/>
dragons, and other mystical creatures that only I can see!<br/>

&quot;My mind not only wanders, it sometimes leaves completely.&quot;<br/>
