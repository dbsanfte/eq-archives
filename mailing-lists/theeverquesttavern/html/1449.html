<div id="ygrps-yiv-104513673">Work has banned Yahoo clubs so I now cannot<br/>
access this page from work now. *pout*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But at any<br/>
rate...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Wow... surprised it can be done. =) The moving<br/>
characters between accounts that is. Not too surprised if<br/>
they&#39;re on the same credit card though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Ring of<br/>
Combines/Dreadlands may be safe in the immediate vicinity BUT I&#39;ve<br/>
been told many many aggresive mobs hang around that<br/>
ring so you can&#39;t leave the safety of the ring for too<br/>
long... took me forever to find those 24 and 29th level<br/>
spells as well. I still have some to buy off the<br/>
Steamfont Druid vendor as well as Anti-poison/disease<br/>
spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic&lt;br&gt;Master<br/>
