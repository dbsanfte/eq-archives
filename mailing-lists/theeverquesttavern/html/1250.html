<b>Subject:</b> New mob in East Freeport? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-236939248">Hi all. I was on a corpse run from East Freeport<br/>
to Oasis this morning and took the sewer route. When<br/>
I jumped into the pool in the sewers in East<br/>
Freeport I was attacked by three Drowned Citizens! I have<br/>
never seen these guys before and I have traveled<br/>
through this area alot. Actually I have never seen any<br/>
mobs in the sewers of Freeport before. Of course there<br/>
are NPCs like at the evil guilds for instance. Anyway<br/>
does anybody know anything about this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They<br/>
give a really nasty disease that takes 2hp per tick<br/>
and lasts for over an hour RL time. Just to give an<br/>
idea how long it lasts I got rabies after haveing this<br/>
disease for 20 minutes or so and the rabies wore off<br/>
before the Drowned Citizen disease did. I finally asked<br/>
a shaman to cure me cause I was gettin tired of it.<br/>
On the bright side my bandageing skill is maxed now.<br/>
)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They where blue to me at 14 and I was naked so I just<br/>
ran so I dont know what they drop. They look just<br/>
like a Madman or Begger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway I forsee many<br/>
newbie corpses sitting at the bottom of the pool in East<br/>
Freeport Sewers in the future. Careful all<br/>
