<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093146776">Beggers are a giant pain..lol. there&#39;s nothing i<br/>
enjoy more then putting togeather newbie packs for<br/>
druids, warriors etc just a back pack full of misc items<br/>
they could use...i do find observing first helps other<br/>
wise you&#39;re constantly harrassed for more..i like to<br/>
pick the nice ones out that have a sense of compassion<br/>
and not greed, they are the ones who will pass the<br/>
items on when they outgrow them. Another thing that<br/>
irks me is the loudmouths that shout the first newbie<br/>
to do this or that gets what ever item that person<br/>
has to give away (not refering to shouts of no drop<br/>
items or items someone else has and is willing to let<br/>
others that need loot)...i don&#39;t consider ppl like that<br/>
generous i find them to be controling and narcistic ...the<br/>
ones that don&#39;t beg for items are the ones that will<br/>
hang back from taking handouts that require them to do<br/>
tricks for the benifactors amusement those are the ppl i<br/>
want to arm and clothe and have fighting next to<br/>
me..lol..i know they will be the ones more concerned with<br/>
helping kill the mob rather then on their knees looting<br/>
whilst someone else dies.&lt;br&gt; thats my two cp Happy<br/>
