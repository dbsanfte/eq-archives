<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709884627">Thanks for responding to my new to online gaming post<br/>
<br/>
I picked up the trilogy package, started this afternoon and 9 hours <br/>
later can see why is referred to as Evercrack.  Started as a wood elf <br/>
ranger.  2 questions:<br/>
1. On the main screen middle right is a green bar with a number, a <br/>
percentage, a second percentage, another number (always changing, <br/>
what is it ? I couldn&#39;t find it in the manual.<br/>
<br/>
2. Also any recommendations on sites/guide for a good EQ lingo <br/>
glossary.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again</div>
