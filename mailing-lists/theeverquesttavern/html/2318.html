<div id="ygrps-yiv-894168191">yeah, the subject was stupid, but it made me<br/>
laugh. Anyway, i have a question about everquest. I&#39;m<br/>
thinking about getting it, but my friend was telling me<br/>
that it costs money to play it one player. Is this<br/>
true? i don&#39;t see how it could be, but i&#39;m hoping<br/>
someone can shed some light on this for me. thanks.</div>
