saw them fighting ppl around the City guards. The<br/>
Guards weren&#39;t doing a thing to help or defend the<br/>

I&#39;d never seen them before either. But I&#39;ve also<br/>
never gone down into the Sewer system for Freeport. I<br/>
figured it was just like the Greater Spirit. Never seen<br/>
one till recently-- sooooo... =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman/<br/>
