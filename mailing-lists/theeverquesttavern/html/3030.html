&gt; I am going to be starting my EQ adventure, but am curious about what <br/>
&gt; I need to buy.  Should I buy the basic game and all the expansion <br/>
&gt; packs, or just the latest expansion pack?  Are the better expansion <br/>
&gt; packs than others?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess basicly the question I am asking is.....If you were starting <br/>
&gt; from scratch what would you buy?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unless you really have your heart set on playing a Vah Shir (the Cat <br/>
characters), then I would buy as little as possible, probably just the original <br/>
and the Kunark expansion.  That will end up giving you enough zones to try out <br/>
and almost all of the races to try out.<br/>
<br/>
There is no use putting down $50-60 (especially since half of what you would <br/>
end up buying you can&#39;t use for, at least, a few months anyway) on a game just <br/>
to find out that you don&#39;t really like it.  Buy the original and play for a <br/>
little while.  See if you like it.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that Planes of Power will give you starting out is quicker <br/>
travel (you have to be lvl 46 or above to actually move beyond the first zone <br/>
there).  You couldn&#39;t do anything with Scars of Velious at all since it was <br/>
created as a higher levle expansion (lvl 30 and above).<br/>
