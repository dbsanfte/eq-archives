<div id="ygrps-yiv-6864742">what server?<br/>
    I would vote Highpass myself also but I found the number of <br/>
people that can camp here at any time limited so I did KFC in South <br/>
Karana when HIghpass was full.   KFC can also be hard to get a group <br/>
at odd times of day.   the Plus is at 26 hit Splitpaw for great exp <br/>
until you can jump to Sol groups.<br/>
    I have also done Lake omen but found full groups stop at 24 and <br/>
FM groups will not pick you up until 28 so you would have to partner <br/>
with a tank for great exp in omen at that point.<br/>
    I did cleric and warrior though KFC and highpass and bard though <br/>
IllOmen.   As shaman getting regen at 24 it should not be as hard for <br/>
you to manage at that point.  It will depend on time of day and <br/>
waiting lists and server really.  <br/>
<br/>
was that a griffon or bard that just ran past? :)</div>
