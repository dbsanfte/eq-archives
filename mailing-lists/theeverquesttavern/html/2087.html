<b>Subject:</b> my view of iksars monks and necros! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-210805507">Well from what i seen and such i think a iksar<br/>
monk is just as good as the human one but maybe a<br/>
little weaker in areas but still the iksar is a force to<br/>
be reckoned with and curious question who would win<br/>
the duel against a necro and a shadow knight?Would it<br/>
be the necro since he has more spells to use!</div>
