<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037061457">Thanks, I&#39;d like to see that /con<br/>
guide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hide/Sneak - (I&#39;m also answering the post after this one<br/>
from subemc) -- I know about the /con-indifferent<br/>
thing; that&#39;s worked for me in Freeport, although I<br/>
think you have to be behind the MOB/merchant. Then<br/>
they&#39;ll sell to you. I tried it while Hidine/Sneaking in<br/>
front of them, and they still regarded me<br/>
apprehensively or dubiously, and wouldn&#39;t sell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the<br/>
thing about the Orcs is that I walked right past two of<br/>
them without them seeing me. After the stomped me, I<br/>
went back and looked at the events, and there was no<br/>
&quot;Auto-Attack On,&quot; so I don&#39;t think I hit that by mistake. It<br/>
just seems that suddenly they could see me for some<br/>
reason, so I wondered if it was the Oracle. I had no time<br/>
to hit /con -- I was about 5 feet away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m a<br/>
gutsy little guy sometimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
