<b>Subject:</b> Re: thinking about EQ -- Part 1 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475784528">No, no flames here for misguided souls (! - I<br/>
should talk, I&#39;ve never even looked at AC).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But<br/>
this should be a fun post to answer. First, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be surprised if they do give you a new key at<br/>
customer service; they can figure out if the old one has<br/>
been used, and if it hasn&#39;t, why not give you a new<br/>
one? They want people to play. Or, just get the $9.95<br/>
version for now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explain the game? Hm. Hard to<br/>
explain an irrational addiction that keeps you up every<br/>
night past your bedtime, and leads you to sites like<br/>
these during the day where you can daydream about it .<br/>
. . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s a question - what kind of player<br/>
are you? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Powergamer -- gotta have lotsa loot,<br/>
cool garb, big honkin&#39; weapons and of course, high<br/>
levels as quickly as possible so you can kill bigger and<br/>
badder stuff?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roleplayer -- the journey is the<br/>
thing, meeting people, exploring all the nooks and<br/>
crannies of a zone?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or somewhere in between? Again,<br/>
I don&#39;t know about AC, but that&#39;s the joy of EQ, as<br/>
it accomodates all players, even in the same group<br/>
sometimes. I&#39;m adventuring on the lizard-continent of<br/>
Kunark, now, and I find myself in groups with Iksar (the<br/>
playable lizard-man race). My character doesn&#39;t quite know<br/>
what to think of them, so I tell them as much when<br/>
grouping . . . Two nights ago, one told me to &quot;watch your<br/>
tongue, little one&quot; and kept making comments on the order<br/>
of &quot;You have to skin them; the hair is bad for the<br/>
digestion.&quot; OK, so I can&#39;t tell males and females apart yet .<br/>
. . The powergamers in the group just let us have<br/>
our fun, meanwhile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some tips: Don&#39;t<br/>
play a Player vs. Player (PvP) server to begin with;<br/>
you&#39;ll be very frustrated. A &quot;roleplaying&quot; server with a<br/>
slightly different ruleset will be launched later this<br/>
year, which looks interesting (but no PvP). And don&#39;t<br/>
turn in your Book of Discord, which allows you to go<br/>
PvP on a &quot;blue&quot; (non-PvP) server. You won&#39;t be able<br/>
to interact with anyone (cast or be cast on, for<br/>
example) unless they&#39;re also &quot;red.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Older servers<br/>
tend to be more crowded; my server (Drinal) used to be<br/>
a green, &quot;preferred&quot; server, but is now just a<br/>
regular one. More people=more competition for hunting<br/>
grounds, perhaps, but also more people around to help if<br/>
you need it, and to sell stuff, theoretically. One or<br/>
two servers are &quot;unofficial&quot; roleplay servers, but I<br/>
forget which. There&#39;s even one with a strong European<br/>
contingent.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Continued on next post . . . Yahoo! doesn&#39;t<br/>
like wordy posts!</div>
