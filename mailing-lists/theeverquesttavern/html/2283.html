<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100364469">Greetings, ertuio2000, fellow Drinalian (?)<br/>
--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have two characters I play regularly on Drinal,<br/>
and a third that I dabble with<br/>
occasionally:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht is a 27th level Dwarf Rogue, about one kill away<br/>
from 28. Undinged, so that kind of sucked. Currently<br/>
in Rivervale/Misty Thicket, looking for<br/>
Slaythe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nazbeku is an 11th level Troll Shadow Knight, currently<br/>
in South Ro. Haven&#39;t grouped much with her, and<br/>
faction is an issue, since I&#39;m not playing to get into<br/>
Freeport or anything. So, for now, staying close to home<br/>
-- Grobb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uenlaenae (I hate that name) is a<br/>
7th level Wood Elf Warrioress. Just wanted to see<br/>
what it was like from the other side of the MOb from<br/>
my Rogue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feel free to drop me a line if you<br/>
see any of these folks on line. Usually late at night<br/>
U.S. Pacific time. Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t had time<br/>
to do much grouping, so I&#39;ve been concentrating on<br/>
the SK. Yyou might catch me at a good time, though,<br/>
so give it a<br/>
shot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht/Nazbeku/Uenlaenae</div>
