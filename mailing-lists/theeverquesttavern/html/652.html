<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533136310">It really depends on what level you are and your<br/>
available funds. Flowing Black Robes (FBR) are very popular<br/>
and can be bought for a little over 200pp from<br/>
players. But those are found in Najena which is in East<br/>
Antonica. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it sounds like you&#39;re over in Fayder,<br/>
so you might want to try to buy a Robe of the Keeper<br/>
instead. They are dropped in Mistmoore which borders<br/>
Lesser Faydark. Players sell them for roughly 80pp,<br/>
which IMO is too much, but whatever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are<br/>
just some options available. These assume you are<br/>
between level 10 and 25. If you&#39;re above that, then you<br/>
probably already have a good robe. If you&#39;re below level<br/>
10, then I&#39;d just be happy with the robe you started<br/>
with if I were you. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter<br/>
