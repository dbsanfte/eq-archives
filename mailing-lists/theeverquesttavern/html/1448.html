<div id="ygrps-yiv-507416888">Some GMs will tell you it is not possible to move<br/>
a character from one account to another. They<br/>
generally as a rule do not do it. However, it can be done<br/>
and I think it is judged on a case by case basis.<br/>
When my husband and I got our second computer we got 2<br/>
accounts and moved one of our characters over to the other<br/>
account. As far as trying to sell characters...that could<br/>
be why they do not do this often. Both our accounts<br/>
use the same credit card information and we dealt<br/>
with a VERY nice GM, so it was a fairly easy process<br/>
for us to get the second account. BUT, a friend of<br/>
mine that very week was told that this could not be<br/>
done. So she started over. She was very distressed to<br/>
find out it was possible after she had already deleted<br/>
her character from the other account. Also, you will<br/>
have to buy your own version of EQ to install, as you<br/>
cannot use the same registration number for more than<br/>
one account. :( Good luck. I hope this<br/>
helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sadia Willowynde&lt;br&gt;High Elven Enchantress&lt;br&gt;Master<br/>
