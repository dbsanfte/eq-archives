<div id="ygrps-yiv-668330451">I have a 31 Iksar Shammy (Reptilious) and a 29<br/>
Wizzard (Wizzkid). They both have fine attributes. I like<br/>
the shammy because he can now heal for 300 per shot<br/>
and can have SOW whenever he wants. On the other<br/>
hand, I like the Wizzard for his pure offensive power<br/>
and his ability to gate to a lot of zones. He is a<br/>
deffinate plus in any group. However, if you decide to make<br/>
a wizzy be aware that you will probably have to<br/>
solo for most of your low levels. Good luck my friend<br/>
in whatever you<br/>
decide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reptilious/Wizzkid&lt;br&gt;Xegony Server</div>
