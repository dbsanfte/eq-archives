<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787618048">I don&#39;t think I can manage a 2 part post-- but<br/>
i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll try some time soon! Remember what<br/>
School House Rocky said-- &quot;Knowledge is Power!!&quot; I have<br/>
yet to play an Erudite or a human from Qeynos, so<br/>
those chars and their quests will actually be very new<br/>
for me, as would an Iksar (i&#39;ve only played around<br/>
with it a bit). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ is great at offering those<br/>
of us who have played a bit a &quot;born-again-newbie&quot;<br/>
option with the new expansions. Val-Shir?? It will be<br/>
all new if you want it to-- BUT... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the EQ<br/>
world experience will still be there, so you won&#39;t<br/>
freak out the first time a 2d spider joins in the fight<br/>
and hits you from behind. I remember jumping in my<br/>
seat, shouting out loud, and running around trying to<br/>
remember which way to my city zone (newbie gnome in<br/>
Steamfont). I didn&#39;t even leave Steamfont for 9 levels<br/>
because I was afraid to zone. I can still remember the<br/>
feeling when I first got on the boat to FP--- now I hate<br/>
taking any boat and pay to avoid it!!!! &lt;br&gt;You know how<br/>
to hit the F9 key to see what&#39;s going on, how to<br/>
stay safe in certain zones, how to get away from a bad<br/>
situation, basic fighting/flight stragegies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now<br/>
we&#39;ll have horses, and the whole world will be bright<br/>
and new. Next year we&#39;ll have mermen/mermaids and<br/>
we&#39;ll all be riding seahorses and learning underwater<br/>
fighting tactics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can&#39;t wait too see the first<br/>
lvl 2 Val-Shir bard in full lambent armor. I&#39;m saving<br/>
my /bird for that one!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>
