<div id="ygrps-yiv-543193278">Yep-- hit the &quot;-&quot; key to take them. Remember that you can hit F10 to <br/>
get full screen shot, and F9 first to change the angle to get more <br/>
diverse pics.  <br/>
<br/>
The are stored in your EQ file as EQ0000001, etc, or something like <br/>
that. They are saved in .BMP format, so I usually always make them <br/>
over into .jpg after I log off.  BMPs take up lots of space, <br/>
especially when you are &quot;camera happy&quot; and forget that you&#39;ve got <br/>
hundreds of SS (screenshots) hanging out there.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s the minus key by default if I remember correctly, and they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; saved in your game folder.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Question? I was just looking at some of the pics and I saw one <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; said screen shots. How do you do those and where are they saved <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; &gt; your comp? (I do remember them from when I did play I just never <br/>
&gt; took <br/>
&gt; &gt; any.) The Raven <br/>

&gt; &gt; P.S. Still waiting on word about housing....I think I&#39;ll go bug <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; &gt; Monday after Bio and Soc. At least I did give them a few days <br/>
before <br/>
&gt; &gt; I start to bug them! </span></blockquote></div>
