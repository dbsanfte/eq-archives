<b>Subject:</b> Question about Plat Guides. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-499449199">I do not want to pay for Plat Guides... I like playing the Game too <br/>
much.  However I wish I knew how to lvl faster and get Plat faster <br/>
since I can not play but about 1 time a week.<br/>
<br/>
I heard these guides do not tell you much.  However I have learned <br/>
how to use the Deathfist Belts to lvl up a new character real fast <br/>
found in EC.  What else do I not know?  Is there a website that can <br/>
teach me some of the secrets?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
