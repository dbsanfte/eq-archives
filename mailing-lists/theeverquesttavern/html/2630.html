<div id="ygrps-yiv-435318559">OK, glad that (sort of) got resolved for you.  And sorry that I <br/>
spaced and didn&#39;t come back right away to see what&#39;s up.  The sad <br/>
part is that you still might have trouble even with up-to-snuff <br/>
components.  In that case, definitely do a post to the tech board.</div>
