Windows. A lot of the time that will fix things. Remember you will <br/>
lose any screeensavers,etc...you have in your Windows files. And <br/>
anything you have saved on the desktop. Be sure and do your backups <br/>
and good luck...:&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Actually, depends. Installing Windows over itself can work but it <br/>
depends on what Windows version you&#39;ve got.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do it except as a last resort in Windows 98. Can&#39;t be 95 <br/>
or below cause EQ doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
XP and ME are better bets for install over itself but you have to <br/>
worry about like driver, system file stuff... etc. But supposedly <br/>
there&#39;s a lot fewer problems with that. I&#39;ve just never tried it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s all sorts of stuff you can do to try to pull the system back <br/>
up-- but most rely on being able to get into safe mode...<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s system restore, msconfig stuff, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also you can try the old scanreg /restore in dos trick but that&#39;s <br/>
harder to do in ME. I can&#39;t remember the exact trick. *pouts* It is <br/>
possible though I&#39;ve heard a lot say it no longer is in ME and XP. <br/>
*shrugs* I am not 100% positive for XP but know ME does have a way <br/>
for sure and am fairly sure though more along 65% type of sure...<br/>
<br/>
Oh well. Hope that helped.<br/>
