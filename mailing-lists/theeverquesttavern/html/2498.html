<div id="ygrps-yiv-787812797">I agree that SK spires is a great place to hunt<br/>
in mid 20s-- even at low 20s if you can get into a<br/>
good group. I started grouping there with my druid at<br/>
lvl 22, and was welcome for heals, Damage shileds and<br/>
SOW, as well as nukes (that got resisted a lot at that<br/>
level though). For a low 20s char-- the loot isn&#39;t bad.<br/>
You can get the scrolls for the gem inlaid guants,<br/>
get some FS weapons occasionally, get a dagger of<br/>
dropping, and SP armor (doesn&#39;t sell that well anymore,<br/>
except the gloves which still go for at least 15pp, at<br/>
least on Xev). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At upper 20s, you can find<br/>
adventurers willing to go inside PAW, where grouping in the<br/>
&quot;safe rooms&quot; are great xp, if not a bit boring. Don&#39;t<br/>
forget &quot;KFC&quot; (which we lovingly refer to as the aviak<br/>
town in SK). The aviaks are of varying levels, meaning<br/>
you can solo or group fight them for many levels.<br/>
They drop some quest items, so there&#39;s always people<br/>
ready to group on them. SK is a great place to kite if<br/>
you&#39;re a druid, and I would kite aviaks around when<br/>
soloing for great xp. You can also charm an elephant to<br/>
help you out-- I had great fun letting my elephant<br/>
pets beat down the little chickens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did do<br/>
Lake Rathe a few times, just at the gnoll/undead camp<br/>
on the other side of the SK zone, which was a great<br/>
camp, but not easy to get a group to go there (at least<br/>
in my experience). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After 27-- you can go the<br/>
boring route and head to FM and then to OT on Kunark. FM<br/>
is acutally a good place to group at the giant<br/>
fort-- some good loot can drop and giant killing is fun<br/>
for all. OLD WORLD spots for high 20s to 30s usually<br/>
means dungeons. Cazic Thule is great, but not easy<br/>
access. Rathe Mtns is almost within reach, and you might<br/>
be able to get a group of giant hunters there once<br/>
you hit 30. SK gnolls is your best bet. Unrest is<br/>
still viable, but you have to go after some mean mobs.<br/>
Mistmore is viable, but only at the ent area at high<br/>
20s/low 30s. Stonebrunt is good hunting, but it&#39;s way<br/>
over there, so bring your own group. If you&#39;re on<br/>
Kunark, don&#39;t forget about Warslik&#39;s Woods-- Forest giant<br/>
camp, gobbies and iksar, and not crowded at all.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(continued)...</div>
