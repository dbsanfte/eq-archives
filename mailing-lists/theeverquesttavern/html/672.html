<div id="ygrps-yiv-79603067">A bit of advice. If it&#39;s your first time playing<br/>
I recomend a warrior, just to get used to the<br/>
game.&lt;br&gt;Warriors are pretty much the simplest class, and probably<br/>
the easiest to play in the early levels.&lt;br&gt;After you<br/>
get more familiar with the game and how combat works,<br/>
you can switch to another class.&lt;br&gt;As for race,<br/>
Barbarians make good warriors, and their town&#39;s pretty<br/>
simple, but they&#39;re kind of hard to get started with as<br/>
far as their hunting grounds go. Unless you use the<br/>
right strategy, you&#39;ll die a lot before making level<br/>
2.&lt;br&gt;Freeport has 2 good starting areas, but the lag&#39;s<br/>
intolerable. So I recomend starting in Qeynos. The lag&#39;s not<br/>
too bad, and there&#39;s plenty of good hunting from<br/>
level 1-3.&lt;br&gt;Oh, and have your friend show you how to<br/>
hotkey your attacks.</div>
