<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007746163">You want soap opera, see the Los Angeles Times<br/>
from last week (Tuesday, 4/24, perhaps? Their site is<br/>
down right now, so I can&#39;t search.) (Heads are<br/>
rolling, I&#39;m sure). Anyway, they evidently sent someone to<br/>
the Fan Faire, and published an article on in-game<br/>
marriages -- one woman married someone in-game . . . but<br/>
she&#39;s married to a different person in RL (who doesn&#39;t<br/>
play EQ, I think). The guy says he&#39;s &quot;OK with it&quot; --<br/>
though it was weird at first, but the guy (in-game<br/>
husband) seems like a nice guy . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That would be the sound of my privates getting cut off<br/>
by my wife if I ever &quot;married&quot; someone in-game. I<br/>
think it&#39;s kind of strange, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m gonna have<br/>
to go to EC (is that East Commons?) and see what all<br/>
the fuss is about. I bought my Dwarven ring mail in<br/>
Kelethin, and that place seems like an auction zoo<br/>
sometimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;10th season Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
