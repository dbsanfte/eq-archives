<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728119611">Hmm, well I&#39;ve never heard of a fighter, but I&#39;m<br/>
guessing your human is a warrior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as for your<br/>
rogue (not a thief), he&#39;s in Rivervale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is<br/>
no secret to making money/leveling quickly, really.<br/>
It comes slowly at first, very slowly. Just worry<br/>
about getting good experience, getting what equipment<br/>
when you can, and learning how each class works in a<br/>
group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You must realize that this game takes a ton of time.<br/>
At this point in the game I have put in almost 40<br/>
full days. That&#39;s 880 hours to get to the point I am<br/>
at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, try not to rush to get money, loot, or levels.<br/>
Just go at your own pace and do your best to have<br/>
fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar</div>
