<div id="ygrps-yiv-235936469">I can understand wanting to keep OT faction, but<br/>
you do miss out on a ton of necro-friendly zones by<br/>
keeping it. HS is about the best zone for us. And KC is<br/>
nice too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once I got my OT gate hammer i<br/>
trashed OT faction. I can still use it as it is fairly<br/>
easy to gate there and not get aggrod by anything but<br/>
a green skeleton. Then ya just run outover the<br/>
water and feign death, quit out to clear aggro, and you<br/>
are good to go.</div>
