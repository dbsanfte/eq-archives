<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066261970">Hi all....<br/>
<br/>
Hope you&#39;re all very well!<br/>
<br/>
I just brought a second-hand EverQuest game....couldn&#39;t wait to get <br/>
home and join the fun...<br/>
<br/>
Then it happened the Cd key number doesn&#39;t work! (aaaaa!)<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know what I can do to make it work or does anybody know <br/>
of any numbers that do work?<br/>
<br/>
Please help...I&#39;ll do anything to get going....<br/>
<br/>
Yours faithfully,<br/>
<br/>
Scott.</div>
