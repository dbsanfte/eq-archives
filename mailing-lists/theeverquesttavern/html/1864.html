<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893457932">OK-- &quot;hm... I wanna buy 10kpp for $100, please<br/>
e-mail me.&quot; GRRRRR &quot;oooohhh... I wanna be an Uber Twink<br/>
Lvl 3 druid so I can be the scourge of GFay and be<br/>
the only 200WIS druid who /cons green to N00bs.&quot; I&#39;m<br/>
sorry, this kind of blatant twinking ruins the game for<br/>
me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Minor Rant-- I know that we all are assumed to like<br/>
RPGs and other computer games, but why are all these<br/>
Clubs hit with all the &quot;come try my new game&quot; &quot;come<br/>
beta test this hot new game&quot;? Don&#39;t they understand<br/>
that we&#39;re all addicted to EQ?? Giving up EQ to try<br/>
your new &quot;hot&quot; game would be like passing up driving a<br/>
Ferrari to ride shotgun in a Nova. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And why aren&#39;t<br/>
there any good mid level quests for Druids? Does<br/>
verrant think we really want a &quot;Wee Harvester&quot;? OMG-- i<br/>
can already summon my own food and drink (or forage<br/>
it), so why do I want to carry around a 2hb shovel???<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And why do Enchanters have to run all the way to HH<br/>
to get pet spells? The pets suck anyway, but I need<br/>
all the help i can get at lvl 8. So I have to go from<br/>
Gfay to HH??? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what&#39;s the deal with stop<br/>
lights?? There&#39;s too many of them in my town and they<br/>
always seem to turn red whenever I get close to<br/>
them!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And why does airplane food have to be so bad? Is it<br/>
so hard to figure out how to get decent food on an<br/>
airplane, heat it up and serve it so we can tell the<br/>
difference between chicken and fish???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what&#39;s the<br/>
deal with this itchy rash I&#39;ve got? Should I go see a<br/>
doctor, or just cover it with a band-aid and hope it goes<br/>
away!!!???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/Xela goes into a Berzerker rage&lt;br&gt;/Xela Calms down</div>
