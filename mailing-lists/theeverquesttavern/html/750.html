<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725983392">I myself have a problem with beggers. It&#39;s not<br/>
that i&#39;m mean or don&#39;t want to help, it&#39;s just once<br/>
you hit lvl 20 and get a last name BAM....you get<br/>
people begging you for plats and stuff. I have never<br/>
begged for anything. I have had things given to me<br/>
though, but never through begging and I gave my heartfelt<br/>
thanks afterward. I&#39;m now lvl 40 and am bombarded with<br/>
tells begging for stuff. I&#39;ve gone anon but that<br/>
doesn&#39;t help. People will con me then inspect me without<br/>
asking. I know then that the begging is about to<br/>
commence. This is a HUGE annoyance. The really runny part<br/>
is that I KNOW most of the young characters asking<br/>
me for have high lvl characters as that I play on<br/>
Xegony, the second oldest server. As a newbie, I had no<br/>
idea what I was doing and didn&#39;t even have a clue as<br/>
to what I COULD beg for. So if someone actually begs<br/>
for stuff I don&#39;t give. This isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t<br/>
help out. I pay well for bonechips, spider silks, and<br/>
sometimes snake eggs. This is to both our benifit. It also<br/>
makes them earn what i give. I muck prefer this to just<br/>
handing out plat. I once used my lvl 40 necro to camp<br/>
green gnolls for 3 hrs for a runed totem staff for a<br/>
lvl 9 necro that rescued my baby druid. I reward<br/>
niceness. She was very surprised at what her good deed<br/>
brought her. I gave her all the good gnoll drops and some<br/>
cash. I buff as much as I can in newbie zones while I&#39;m<br/>
there and heal or rescue those in trouble. I also save<br/>
some of my fine steel weapons I get as loot. I&#39;ll<br/>
raffle them off or give them to DE newbies I see helping<br/>
each other. I believe in doing my part to spreading<br/>
some of the benifits of my lvl 40, and I like giving<br/>
my evil guild a good name among the evil races.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I won&#39;t just give you 5pp, but I will give you the<br/>
oppertunity to earn it if you don&#39;t beg.......or annoy me<br/>
;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another thing that bugs me is when newbies try to gouge<br/>
me on bone chips. I realize it&#39;s a buyers market but<br/>
I announce what I&#39;m paying per stack then everyone<br/>
trys to make me pay more.EX I always annouce I&#39;m<br/>
paying 2pp per stack, this is fair market value on<br/>
Xegony. I actually give 4pp or 5pp per stack and ususally<br/>
a nifty item if the seller doesn&#39;t try to make me<br/>
pay more, however, if they gouge me I usually pay the<br/>
demand but never anything more. I try to make it more<br/>
worthwhile for the polite than the merchant hearted. This<br/>
isn&#39;t to say if you auction them for more I won&#39;t be<br/>
sweet, it&#39;s just a big pet peeve of mine being gouged<br/>
because of my lvl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe when I&#39;ve been 50 forever<br/>
I&#39;ll be nicer...but I doubt it. And at lvl 40 I&#39;m<br/>
pretty darn poor! I know people lvl 20 with more money<br/>
than I have =P Hopefully I&#39;ll fix this tonight when a<br/>
friend and i go kill hill giants. Splitting among a<br/>
group of 2 is much better than a group of 6 =) I hope I<br/>
rake it in.... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aeday Femmefatel&lt;br&gt;lvl 40 DE<br/>
