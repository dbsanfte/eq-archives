<div id="ygrps-yiv-797562158">Does anyone know if it is possible to move a<br/>
character from one account to another??? I was starting a<br/>
character on a friends account and they are getting ready<br/>
to move. I have bought a computer and am opening a<br/>
new account but i don&#39;t want to have to start all<br/>
over. Please help if you can. Thank You!!!</div>
