<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783133446">I dont know - maybe I&#39;m the only one to ever have<br/>
this problem but I never knew until recently that<br/>
there was a Gamma thingy that allows you to change your<br/>
brightness in game. I always thought that my Dark Elf should<br/>
be able to see alot better than my Erudite instead<br/>
of only alittle better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found out that my<br/>
Gamma setting was almost all the way to the bottom. Boy<br/>
what a difference it makes when you raise that up a<br/>
bit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also I played for almost a month before a<br/>
friend in the game enlightened me to the fact that there<br/>
is music. Like battle music and the music that comes<br/>
on when you come around certain things like the gate<br/>
at the Qeynos newbie area. My music thing was set<br/>
all the way down so I couldn&#39;t hear it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow<br/>
I just thought that I would post about that here<br/>
because if anybody out there doesnt know about these<br/>
things then your missin out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps<br/>
someone and isnt just a waste of everyones<br/>
time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Venture&lt;br&gt;21 necro&lt;br&gt;Saryrn</div>
