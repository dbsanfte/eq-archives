<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004503189">Welp.. again I find myself having not had time to<br/>
check the boards in a while. I couldn&#39;t even see how<br/>
far back I had to go to see what was new.<br/>
LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glad to see the boards are doing well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)<br/>
Blech. Yeah. Girls seem to get a lot. I assume this is<br/>
coming out of my discussion of my poor druid being asked<br/>
if he was about to be trashed-- from the level 35<br/>
female Elven character whose friends had given her<br/>
enough equip to have 198 wisdom. LOL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes. Women<br/>
get a lot of free things. Still will always play male<br/>
though. Otherwise, I couldn&#39;t entertain and tease<br/>
mercilessly those poor females. Especially the one&#39;s with<br/>
beards or trolls with the last name of Dancing. Grin.<br/>
Yes Gert and Kas. That would be you if you read these<br/>
boards. Grin. Probably not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Anyhoo, My<br/>
guildmates and EQ in general seems to be obsessed with<br/>
items. And yes, it can give you long term sustaining<br/>
power that will help you kite or clear out a ton of<br/>
monsters. But I&#39;ve noticed something else. Downtime, I have<br/>
a quicker turn around b/c I have less mana to med<br/>
up to. I&#39;ve never really kited, and always group for<br/>
everything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I sit and am FOM a lot more often than<br/>
my partymates. Which to me makes me wonder. If<br/>
usually the pullers are pulling when other casters are at<br/>
60 to 80, and I&#39;m at 100.. what&#39;s the point of<br/>
having that extra stuff as a caster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Admittedly,<br/>
as a mellee-type the boats completely different, but<br/>
I spend my money on spells and tradeskills. Never<br/>
have much for equipment. Have bought about 800pp in<br/>
equipment over the last year though. But compared to<br/>
tradeskills and spells combined... last level I spent 270<br/>
plat easy (lvl 39 spells rock though).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;dang,<br/>
sorry to go so long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out... be well<br/>
all&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic of the Drinal server&lt;br&gt;Officer in<br/>
Tribunal of the Antiquities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... had a<br/>
conversation-- only works once in group chat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asking<br/>
about loot distribution and who has what...<br/>
occasionally they ask, &quot;what does everyone have now?&quot; This<br/>
works best in CC when everyone&#39;s splitting equal stacks<br/>
of Crystalline silk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just answer them,<br/>
&quot;Potato&quot; or &quot;Vermouth&quot; or what not. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yes. I<br/>
am crazy.</div>
