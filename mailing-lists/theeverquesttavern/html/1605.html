<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678549410">1. You no longer lose XP at 5. This was patched a<br/>
good while ago, but I&#39;d be hard pressed to say exactly<br/>
when.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. This was in a more recent patch. Verant&#39;s<br/>
reasoning (and a sound one, amazingly) was that Delevelers<br/>
in PvP were ruining the game for new players. By<br/>
putting this in place, they effectively cancelled out the<br/>
only good side-effect of deleveling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.<br/>
According to Absor, on EQ&#39;s Developer&#39;s Corner (Check under<br/>
Feedback at www.everquest.com), you haven&#39;t been able to<br/>
buff/heal an NPC since Beta testing. I haven&#39;t been around<br/>
that long, so I can&#39;t confirm that. But I&#39;d assume an<br/>
employee of Verant, especially Absor, would<br/>
know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Well, it&#39;s entirely possible those Kodiaks were<br/>
on a different faction (Unkempt druids, maybe?). I<br/>
know that I have to be careful in Rathe Mountains as a<br/>
Ranger because the bears there are scowling at<br/>
me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral Stormfang&lt;br&gt;Commander of the Knights of<br/>
