<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914306333">That sounds strange. You could try to reinstall.<br/>
And I think when you run the patch progam that is the<br/>
exe file. Does it give you any messages when you try<br/>
to run or does it just stop? Did it say something<br/>
like you have to re-run that patch program? I will try<br/>
and help ya out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien</div>
