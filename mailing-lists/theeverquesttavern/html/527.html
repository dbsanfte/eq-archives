<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692920668">Last night on Karana I was playing my 29th lv<br/>
shaman and I wanted to get her to lv 30. I knew that if<br/>
I went to highkeep and faught the piclaws I would<br/>
get there quickly with little danger. But i decided<br/>
to look for bull elefants cause i needed a quest<br/>
item off of them and bupped into a creasure called<br/>
Tesch Gnolls. Got up to lv 30 in no time at all. I&#39;m<br/>
going back there again soon. BTW its located outside of<br/>
paw in NK.</div>
