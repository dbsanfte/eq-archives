<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692699560">There&#39;s all kinds of dyes out there, and the<br/>
armor&#39;s color is very much customizable. The stats are<br/>
taken from rubicite armor - the AC is pretty good, but<br/>
once you get past, oh, say, level 40, you&#39;ll need to<br/>
switch to better armor if you can wear it (Crafted,<br/>
Armor of Ro, etc.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is plate based, so only<br/>
warriors, paladins, shadowknights, clerics, and bards can<br/>
wear it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extract are extremely rare drops off<br/>
of certain mobs. Charcoal off of elementals in<br/>
Lavastorm/Steamfont, Essence of Sunlight off of Sand Giants, Russet<br/>
Oxide also off of elementals...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you have<br/>
the dye, either a shaman (alchemy) or a rogue (poison<br/>
making) can combine it to make a dye. With the dye, you<br/>
can tint player-made fine steel armor. Armors can be<br/>
single, double, or tripled dyed. Generally, single dyes<br/>
are darkest in shade whereas triple dyes are<br/>
lightest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be warned, this stuff can be a bit costly. On<br/>
Prexus, an undyed Fine Steel Breastplate runs around<br/>
300pp, with a dye adding maybe 100-200pp more, due to<br/>
time investments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will tell you this, it is<br/>
fun just running around visiting friends in a full<br/>
black suit of armor. Not many warriors get to wear jet<br/>
black armor. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar Alazeem&lt;br&gt;50th<br/>
