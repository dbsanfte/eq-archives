<b>Subject:</b> Raid On Kunark? Huh!? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-321333269">It is coming! The expansion for Everquest, Raid<br/>
on Kunark, will be out this March! I have been<br/>
waiting for sooooooooo long! I have tons of info on the<br/>
expansion, so if you are curious just ask me. It will have a<br/>
new continent in the south called Kunark. On that<br/>
continent and that continent alone there will be 20+ new<br/>
zones, better graphics, and new quests and items! They<br/>
have decided not to add to the original continents (or<br/>
at least not much)...so you won&#39;t be seing new parts<br/>
to your favorite areas. There will be a new<br/>
race...Ikthar, that will be big Dino/Lizzies...very cool<br/>
lookin&#39;...ask me any questions...I might just be able to<br/>
answer. =)</div>
