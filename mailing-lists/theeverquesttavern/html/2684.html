<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919780081">Welcome to our Online Guildhall.<br/>
<br/>
To Join the Dreamweavers you need to<br/>
<br/>
1. Read our Charter and make sure you meet our qualifications. <br/>
<br/>
2. Read our Rules, to see if you agree with them. <br/>
<br/>
3. Fill out our Online Application Form. This lets us know you are <br/>
interested and is required for all members to be added to our roster. <br/>
<br/>
4. Find some Dreamweavers in EverQuest and Chat/Group with them. They <br/>
will become your &#39;sponsors&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
5. Contact an Officer online for an Interview. Let us know you&#39;ve <br/>
applied and who you&#39;ve grouped and spoken with. <br/>
<br/>
After that we contact those Dreamweavers and ask how it went. <br/>
<br/>
Our decision is based on compatibility. If you would fit in with our <br/>
family you are invited. We do this to maintain guild harmony and <br/>
ensure our members continued happiness. <br/>
<br/>
May Tunare Guide Your Path, <br/>
