Seriously though it means that you all will be pretty muh sticking like glue<br/>
wherever you go and will always be there  to help out should one of you all<br/>
get into a spot of trouble.  Not to mention ya&#39;ll wil tend to share<br/>
rescources with each other  more than you would with others etc.<br/>
<br/>
My DE SK (when he was still an active char) got married to a Wood Elf Ranger<br/>
when we were both in our 30&#39;s and we had known each other in game since we<br/>
first grouped together at Orc Highway in Oasis. e wound up   going to<br/>
different places together to hunt  shared rescources  and managed to get<br/>
things one needed  from an area where another was KoS.   heck we even  wound<br/>
up talking to each other on the phone a lot .  heeh talk about high LD bills<br/>
She in Michigan and me here in Florida.  Unfortunatley when I wound up<br/>
having to take a sabbatical fomr EQ due to comp problems (i.e not being able<br/>
to get the cash up fast enough to get my comp to handle the Luclin<br/>
requirements) she wound up  EQ Marrying someone else and I didnt find out<br/>
about it until 2 days after the fact after she had left the guild we were in<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
But for the most part it is a nice little arrangement<br/>
