<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687797434">Hm. Almost seems like a better question is,<br/>
what&#39;s the _character&#39;s_ proper etiquette? I mean, if<br/>
they&#39;re training, they&#39;re hopefully doing it because<br/>
they&#39;re in trouble. They could be doing it to be a<br/>
jackass and/or for payback to someone who KS&#39;d them or<br/>
something . . . But I guess my related point is that if<br/>
it&#39;s a valid &quot;trouble&quot; train, then they should have<br/>
shouted, and you should feel free to jump in. After all,<br/>
you&#39;re only defending yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sometimes pull<br/>
trains on purpose - Butcherblock is great for this<br/>
because it has so many guards. Once, when I needed<br/>
something off one of the bandits I did this: With SoW on<br/>
me, I attacked the one I needed, got jumped by four<br/>
bandits, killed the target, then took off for the guards<br/>
to let them finish the job. I shouted out &quot;Bandit<br/>
train to Crossroads!&quot; and hightailed it. Someone tried<br/>
to help, but said he was too slow. No problem,<br/>
wasn&#39;t looking for help anyway, just trying to warn<br/>
folks on the road.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Another time I got jumped by<br/>
some goblins that I couldn&#39;t handle, so I ran (again<br/>
for Crossroads). Didn&#39;t quite have typing and running<br/>
down at the same time, but I did have a wide-angle<br/>
view on. Saw that a bunch of folks were fighting<br/>
Zarchoomi and/or Corflunk (big Ogres), so I detoured around<br/>
them. Figured they didn&#39;t need the extra grief.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I would jump in, because is someone is training,<br/>
they&#39;re hopefully in trouble, and if not, it&#39;s free<br/>
experience, if you can handle it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
