<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488897109">hi<br/>
i have a de sk too<br/>
she is one of my alts and i love playing her<br/>
the life tap series is wonderful because you can siphon life off your enemy and give it to your self in battle<br/>
you can also take some of their stats with other spells you get and you get an undead pet (make sure you keep bone chips on hand for the spell and keep a rusty you loot to give him)<br/>
the restrictions are difficult to manage but its not impossible to get around<br/>
i can now do business with merchants in east commons because i kill orcs there<br/>
there are some natural enemies that eq sets up for each race and class<br/>
halflings for some reason are yours<br/>
however i didn&#39;t kill the halflings in neriak to try and avoid agitating that faction issue<br/>
i did however find other halfings attacked me in east commons so watch out for them<br/>
when you get to the desert of north ro (next logical step from east commons) do not join groups at dervish camp 1 (closest to the fishing village) dorn b&#39; din is there and he is a de member of the indigo brother hood you do not want to take a faction hit against your own people and that means the indigo brotherhood<br/>
my de is fighting in the oasis of mar at the moment and in a few more lvls ill take her to highkeep in highpass hold, most of the guards there are corrupt so they dont worry about you.  there is however a few pious individuals (npc&#39;s) like the guy in the library who will attack you<br/>
the basement of highkeep are goblins and its a really good exp pump and you can bank there<br/>
when you get to upper 30&#39;s however you can take the boat to &quot;the over&quot; there in kunark (from the oaisis...well its a raft but it works) kunark has more communities on your side of the balance of norrath life (dark) so you can go to the outpost there and goodies cant<br/>
you also dont have to worry about the dragoon gards who patrol the over there hunting you down like other players do so you can be used as a goon spotter for others and they will appriciate that<br/>
there is also places like ferrott and zones surrounding the areas where darkies are born<br/>
the bazaar and shadowhaven (luclin) basically dont care but dont let this fool you other cities like sanctus seru in the dawn shrowd pieks also in luclin will kill you<br/>
also you will find other dark elves you might meet helpful<br/>
sympathy in suffering usually brings people together and most people i have found are good about warning you if you ask<br/>
just hit the ol slash and enter and you get a list of people in zone<br/>
do not go to cities or around them in greater faydark the elves there dont like you at all<br/>
my daughter has a de in her 50&#39;s and she can still only go there in disguise (enchanter)<br/>
an sk is also harder for a de because the game wouldn&#39;t let you be agnostic<br/>
you are a child of innurukk one of the most hated gods in all of norrath (being the god of hate i wonder why)<br/>
just have fun with it and give your self licensee for a little attitude...hehe it goes with the character<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps<br/>
this is only my experence so far ..others will have more <br/>

<br/>
  Okay, I&#39;ve been playing EQ for about a week now and my Dark Elf <br/>
  Shadowknight is level 9. And so far I like the character.<br/>
<br/>
  My question is exactly how restricted is it to play a Dark Elf when I <br/>
  reach upper levels. I know that they are not liked in some places in <br/>
  the game and guards kill you and stuff. But is it going to be so bad <br/>
  that I&#39;m totally restricted to a small area and its not gonna be fun <br/>
  eventually? I just don&#39;t want to get to level 30 or so and find out <br/>
  that I can&#39;t go behind the areas I&#39;m already exploring.<br/>
