<div id="ygrps-yiv-356278144">This may be the only thing I don&#39;t like about the<br/>
game because I too am under 18. They only accept<br/>
credit cards... not sure on who to pay cause I never<br/>
really paid much attention to my mom when she was asking<br/>
for the money... I was too busy playing EQ. I just<br/>
tossed her my waulet and told her to take what it costs<br/>
and went back to playing EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hehe if I<br/>
actually did that to my mom she would have whooped my<br/>
butt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On another note: Congo Rats Xela Orcbane... I too<br/>
took it uppon myself to rid the world of those low<br/>
life scum known as the Orcs... they beat me down many<br/>
times but my score is still better than theirs.</div>
