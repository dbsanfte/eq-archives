<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672170288">I sure haven&#39;t.. but then again I never expected<br/>
it to be on time. I life in the Netherlands and when<br/>
I ordered EQ last year it took UPS 2 friggen months<br/>
to get it here! And that was with their 50 dollar 7<br/>
days worldwide program! And they want me to pay extra<br/>
because I wasn&#39;t home when the UPS guy showed up! Needles<br/>
to say i won&#39;t pay them and they can take me to<br/>
court if they want to... Anyhow just wondering about<br/>
who the lucky ones are... here&#39;s the recent poll from<br/>
EQvaullt (at the moment I entered)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Players<br/>
Poll:&lt;br&gt;Will you be traveling to Kunark tomorrow?&lt;br&gt;Idon&#39;t<br/>
even have Kunark!;56.1%&lt;br&gt;Yes! Rabid Sand Giants<br/>
couldn&#39;t keep me away!;25.7%&lt;br&gt;No, it will be way too<br/>
crowded. I&#39;ll wait a bit.;18.1%</div>
