<div id="ygrps-yiv-112869437">I tried to transfer characters between accounts<br/>
and Verant said they couldn&#39;t do that due exactly to<br/>
the selling of characters thing, so when I started my<br/>
new account (couldn&#39;t get my wife off the other one<br/>
long enough to let me play) I had to start over with a<br/>
new character. Also it is true that the only way to<br/>
transfer a character to another server is when they split,<br/>
this is to maintain the balance of items and other<br/>
special equipment on the servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uinan<br/>
