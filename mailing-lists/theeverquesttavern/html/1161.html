<b>Subject:</b> Re: Harmony, clarity for druids? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-158241169">Found this in the backlogs and I noticed the<br/>
reply to this. I don&#39;t know if anyone clarified this<br/>
but... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Harmony, clarity for druids. This will<br/>
seem like a weird thing but yeah. It&#39;s not as good as<br/>
breeze. But it does give an edge. Not a great edge but in<br/>
terms of pure numbers and clock counting. I&#39;ve surfed<br/>
some websites and on various websites from<br/>
knowledgable ppl...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harmony is a crude breeze (but<br/>
again. From what I read... not anywhere near as good.<br/>
Just helps... worth the casting if you&#39;re near<br/>
oom).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
