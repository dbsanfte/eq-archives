<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233009379">This in in response to the post asking of the mage playing time.  <br/>
Since there has been little in the way of response for the guild, I <br/>
have been playing my chars on rodcet nife server.  Once there is a <br/>
following intrest and more ppl are involved I may find more time to <br/>
play the mage, however atm it is more benificial to me to play my <br/>
char on my server with friends i already know and love.  Seven more <br/>
responses and I&#39;ll have the time, but I do play between 11p-2a CST.  <br/>
If you need to contact me im probably on Rodcet Nife as &quot;Sebwin&quot; so <br/>
if its set to get started let me know.</div>
