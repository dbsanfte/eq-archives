<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233210062">LOL.. don&#39;t know. Hoping to play on Tues after<br/>
work -- though I am not sure on that. Will be<br/>
attempting to group with a friend that&#39;s a<br/>
Paly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh... and since I forgot SK, Paly, and<br/>
Clerics...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clerics. Good Clerics actually need to time their heals.<br/>
Healing is not easy. I notice Clerics healing too early<br/>
all the time. That can cause a groups death as easily<br/>
as a bad tank that doesn&#39;t pull the loner that peels<br/>
off to the healers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timing your healing makes<br/>
a difference. I know LOTS of Clerics and Healers<br/>
that don&#39;t know that if you heal-- you will never agro<br/>
a mob if the tank is under 1/2 life. Wait till he&#39;s<br/>
down 2 1/2 bubbles and you can heal without ever<br/>
agro&#39;ing. Or do what I do-- I cast almost a full circle&#39;s<br/>
heal under. That saves mana b/c my specialization is<br/>
Alteration over all and I can time my med cycles. Plus I can<br/>
heal when tank&#39;s only 2 bubbles down usually without<br/>
getting agro&#39;d.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SK. They&#39;ve got fear and can use<br/>
pets. Not great Tanks but okay. Best thing about SK&#39;s<br/>
is in tough fights-- HT. Not much else I can say<br/>
about SK&#39;s. They tank about as well as a Ranger, and do<br/>
less overall melee damage. However, their spells make<br/>
them a welcome addition. I know very little about SK&#39;s<br/>
other than that I don&#39;t have them in a group<br/>
often.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paly&#39;s. I love these guys too. Terrible tanks as I get<br/>
higher but the heals are a welcome sight to my poor<br/>
mana. Plus they can buff themselves so I don&#39;t have to<br/>
heal and they can STUN. Ever been in a Chain Stun<br/>
group? S&#39; cool. Especially a Chanter, Paly, Wizzie chain<br/>
stun group. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... sorry for<br/>
the rant on Clerics. Love them to death and their<br/>
Rezzes rock. But many clerics, don&#39;t seem to time their<br/>
heals well and I&#39;m constantly pulling off mobs from<br/>
clerics. Snare, dot, stun, beg. They end up begging to<br/>
kill me. LOL.</div>
