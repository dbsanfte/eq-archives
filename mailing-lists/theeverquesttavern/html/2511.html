<div id="ygrps-yiv-860733588">We have not had the &quot;what&#39;s the best server&quot;<br/>
question for awhile here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I now play almost<br/>
exclusively on Xev. Xev is one of the newest non-pvp, non<br/>
specialty (UK or role play perferred) servers. It is still<br/>
nearly a year and a half old, though, and is becoming<br/>
more like the other servers-- crowded at times, fights<br/>
for camp spots, lots of uber twinkage. BUT the<br/>
population still seems to be lower than most, and I still<br/>
group with a lot of new players when I play my alts.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I abondoned all other servers a year ago, with the<br/>
exception of:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sullon Zek-- still gotta get my PVP on<br/>
every once in a while. Yes, Ogre shammies can Kite.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firiona Vie-- Very fun server with a tight knit community<br/>
of mostly roll-players. Rule set is sometimes a<br/>
hindrance, but can also be fun-- nothing is No Drop, so lots<br/>
of good trading for stuff you wouldn&#39;t normally<br/>
find. Also, there next to no twinkage, because you can<br/>
only have 1 char-- so people marvel at me for being in<br/>
full banded-- haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your thoughts??</div>
