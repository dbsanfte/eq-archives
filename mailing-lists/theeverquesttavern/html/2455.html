<div id="ygrps-yiv-458035081">I think the great one was talking about the item<br/>
spaces on his char, not his bank. You don&#39;t want to walk<br/>
around with those giant satchels from the Bazzarr-- i<br/>
think they weight around 25 or more stones each!!!!<br/>
Those toolboxes can be bought in Thurgadin too-- at<br/>
least they were when I bought them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahhh....<br/>
the good old days. I forgot that I lost a lvl 5 char<br/>
in the Gfaydark-- never found him and just started<br/>
over by getting a new rusty scimitar and cloth<br/>
armor!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I started my Chanter, it was the first char I<br/>
took to CB in nearly a year. It was sooo funny,<br/>
because even on Xev (one of the newest regular servers,<br/>
though almost a year and a half old) I was finding a lot<br/>
of true newbies. OMG-- trying to explain /assist,<br/>
targeting, avoiding hits, pet control, nuking, the benefit<br/>
of the snare spell-- things we just take for<br/>
granted. I remember being teamed with 2 erudites in CB at<br/>
level 8-- these were their 1st chars-- How did they get<br/>
all the way to CB????? It was funny and sad because<br/>
one of them died later and was bound in Erudin.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have played a lot of classes up to the mid 20s,<br/>
and still find it amazing how many times players<br/>
don&#39;t know about the most beneficial spells/abilities.<br/>
Showing a rogue how to evade, and my favorite is<br/>
explaining Harmony to a druid. There is so much to this game<br/>
and so much to each class. Heck, I had to /bonk my RL<br/>
friend for not ever casting his stun spells as a Pally,<br/>
and he&#39;s level 40!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ok ok ok enough for<br/>
today&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>
