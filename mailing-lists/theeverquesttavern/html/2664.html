<b>Subject:</b> Disappearing characters <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-122467074">Greetings!<br/>
I was wondering if anyone was experiencing the disappearing character <br/>
phenomenon.<br/>
This is when another player character is right in front of you, then <br/>
all off a sudden they seemingly pop out of existance. Yet, they can <br/>
see your character, and soon they reappear. <br/>
I have seen one extreme case where the pc was blinking in and out. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t just myself who was experiencing this phenomena at the time, <br/>
but three other players were also having the same thing happen when <br/>
they attempted to see that one PC. <br/>
When it was reported to the bug screen, the GM had the audacity to <br/>
say that the character was Invisible. As my main is a level 47 druid, <br/>
I think I know when peeps are camo&#39;d or such. Not to mention it&#39;s <br/>
happened while I was grouped with my husband&#39;s character and was able <br/>
to turn around and look at his monitor...easy enough to speak to him <br/>
two feet away to KNOW he&#39;s not camo. <br/>
I was curious as to whether or not the experience is exclusive to <br/>
Quellious or if people on other servers have the same thing happen. <br/>
Believe me, this is not a good thing in certain situations. <br/>
Especially if you&#39;re not grouped and need to see the other person. <br/>
(i.e. trade).<br/>
Thanks<br/>
