<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240698990">Not really ignoring you. At least with me, it&#39;s<br/>
been too busy with life and actually... also EQ. I&#39;ve<br/>
only had an hour here and there each day to really<br/>
play-- not enough time for EXP really but eh. What can<br/>
one do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue of the Drinal<br/>
Server.&lt;br&gt;Master fisher, beggar, hugger of trees.&lt;br&gt;Average<br/>
fletcher, and brewer&lt;br&gt;Pathetic Tailor, and<br/>
Smith.&lt;br&gt;Speaker of many languages at awful,&lt;br&gt;but Dwarven and<br/>
Elder Dragoon at average&lt;br&gt;and Master of many skills<br/>
but Master&lt;br&gt;to none.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... just feeling<br/>
silly. So listing&lt;br&gt;far too many things. =)Forgive me.<br/>
I do things impetuously for the humor and sake of<br/>
the moment.</div>
