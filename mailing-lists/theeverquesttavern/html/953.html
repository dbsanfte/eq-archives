<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248364099">ok now here the thing. My Friend started an iskar<br/>
and got this kewl sword called a Shan &#39; Tok . 1 Hand<br/>
slashing and like a Dmg of 8. They are very abundant in<br/>
that town. Now i&#39;m a lvl 10 War In Qynos and Qynos<br/>
doesn&#39;t have the sword and niether does Erudin. The next<br/>
nearest town is OGGOK i will head there tomarrow night<br/>
unless anyone knows where i can buy this sword. It looks<br/>
like deer Antlers.</div>
