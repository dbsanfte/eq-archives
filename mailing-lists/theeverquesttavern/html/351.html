<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665883462">My teleport Prob is over. I&#39;m back on good ol&#39;<br/>
Antonica (even though I love Faydwer). I wish that that<br/>
tele &quot;Stonehenge&quot; place was a little closer to FP, in<br/>
a safer zone than West Commons. Maybe EC. Anywho,<br/>
I&#39;m kinda angry that Round Kick replaces Kick and<br/>
isn&#39;t seperate. I guess its more realistic this way<br/>
(how would you be able to kick then round kick in a<br/>
row but not kick twice?). I just was hoping to have<br/>
some cool combos going like in Fighting Games. Left,<br/>
Right, Low Kick, Slide, Uppercut, K.O.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That would<br/>
look so cool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks, I&#39;m gonna reinstall soon.</div>
