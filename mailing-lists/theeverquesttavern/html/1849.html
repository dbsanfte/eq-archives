<b>Subject:</b> Re: Hmm... Manners <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080207251">People with bad manners will always be around...I<br/>
chalk it up to poor parenting and/or being too<br/>
self-centered. I have found that by simply telling them of their<br/>
offense is enough to correct it...at least for the time<br/>
being. If not, then /ignore seems to do the trick<br/>
;-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally I love to help others...specially newbies.<br/>
Nothing makes me smile more than to convert the 10<br/>
Pristine Scarab Carapice&#39;s that I drug over from Unrest<br/>
into Scarab Breastplates then to /shout a free<br/>
giveaway to first 10 noobs to poke me. Then just sit back<br/>
and watch all the little people come-a-runnin :-) I<br/>
cant tell you how many times those people have done<br/>
nice things for me in return...out of the blue,<br/>
because they remembered my actions...be it healing me in<br/>
a time of need...giving me a nice piece of<br/>
equip...providing services...etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess my point is that<br/>
most people want to interact in a positive way and<br/>
have fun...just like we do. Many times they do not<br/>
realize that they are being rude or discourteous by their<br/>
action or inaction. So it is up to us to point it out to<br/>
them. If they continue their rudeness then there are<br/>
other things you can do...most obvious being..to ignore<br/>
and not deal with them in the future. In my own<br/>
defense...I never assume that a port or a SoW is free (unless<br/>
grouped) and always offer to pay. More times than not,<br/>
payment is refused and we go on our merry way, both<br/>
feeling good. With the other time...it was money well<br/>
spent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If any of you play on Bertoxx, send me a<br/>
tell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quynnelleon&lt;br&gt;Ranger of Tunare for 22 Seasons</div>
