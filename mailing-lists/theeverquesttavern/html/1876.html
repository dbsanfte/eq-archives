<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-828379764">I have only been playing for a year. I would not<br/>
feel guilty about consolidating my items and money to<br/>
one character. I quite often transfer funds and items<br/>
between them as it is. I see my characters as a group of<br/>
friends who give/loan stuff to each other. Now granted,<br/>
I&#39;m not a single digit level toon running around in<br/>
plane gear, but my bard does have 3 pieces of lambent<br/>
and she&#39;s just 21. &lt;br&gt;To me, minor twinking (fs<br/>
weapon, something not outrageous) is ok. Think of it as<br/>
friends looking out for each other. However, level 3<br/>
bards with full lambentor singing steel (I have seen<br/>
them!) running for their lives from orc pawns are<br/>
ridiculous. I&#39;ve had level 3 warriors with wurmslayers and<br/>
better gear than my 25th warrior asking me for stuff. I<br/>
had one guy trying to impress me with the fact that<br/>
he had spent 13k for a robe for his level 6 caster.<br/>
A fool and his money..... My rambling is now over.<br/>
Sorry for any stress it causes!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kei&lt;br&gt;Frehley,<br/>
