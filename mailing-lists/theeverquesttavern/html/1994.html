<div id="ygrps-yiv-216139611">&quot;When I said the account is stoped. I meant that<br/>
the person has stoped paying for the account.<br/>
&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;ll re-read the post, he states that it&#39;s an<br/>
inactive account without specifying what&#39;s<br/>
inactive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, he adds relevant info that makes me think that he<br/>
didn&#39;t pay during the period he mentions. He states that<br/>
Sony/Verant reserves the right to delete non-paying accounts<br/>
after 3 months. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m guessing that he means that<br/>
they often don&#39;t care or it&#39;s too much work to delete<br/>
when they don&#39;t have to and they leave chars on the<br/>
servers even up to a year or more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sounds<br/>
consistant with others that I&#39;ve talked to. Some get deleted<br/>
in a few months, but most tell me that 6 months or<br/>
more later... they&#39;ve still got<br/>
characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic (now even more late for<br/>
school.. .lol)</div>
