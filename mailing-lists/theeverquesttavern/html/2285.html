<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113103213">You have to remember that a large portion of the<br/>
time that is calculated for the download time comes<br/>
from the traffic on the download server. I myself was<br/>
getting times of 7 hours with a 28k connection (crappy<br/>
phone lines) However, I hit it at about 4 am cst and it<br/>
went through real quick.</div>
