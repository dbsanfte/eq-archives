<div id="ygrps-yiv-896391330">Boy, seems kind of slow around here, so here are<br/>
some questions for you all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other night I<br/>
was looking for some of the low-level bandits to kill<br/>
in Butcherblock Mountains. The named ones are too<br/>
tough for my 7th level Rogue, but Jeet won&#39;t tell me<br/>
about the Cleaner quest until I knock off a few<br/>
bandits, apparently. Anyway, as I snuck to the PegLeg&#39;s<br/>
camp, two druids in wolf form went racing past. Coming<br/>
to the camp, I see a scene of carnage -- all five<br/>
(?) Dwarf bandit leaders lying dead on the ground. I<br/>
looked around and didn&#39;t see anybody . . . so I started<br/>
looting. Picked up all their tongues, a Gnoll Splitpaw,<br/>
and a vial of dwarf blood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, here&#39;s a<br/>
question -- did I violate some etiquette by looting the<br/>
dead? I banked the tongues for later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, in<br/>
the last day -- since hitting 7th level, the wording<br/>
on my blue cons has changed. It used to say --<br/>
&quot;looks like you&#39;d have the upper hand,&quot; or something<br/>
like that. But last night, it says -- &quot;looks risky,<br/>
but you might win.&quot; Did this change in a patch? Or<br/>
are there two levels of blue cons?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to<br/>
all, and good hunting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
