<div id="ygrps-yiv-330940343">Sorry my message was so long, the basic thing is<br/>
that I can&#39;t connect to EQ and we think it is because<br/>
of the cable connection that we use. Our ISP is<br/>
RoadRunner, they are unwilling to help us find the problem,<br/>
but we think we know the problem. We cannot connect<br/>
to EQ using our cable modem but we hooked up our old<br/>
phone modem and d/led AOL and now we CAN get back on.<br/>
So it must be something having to do with the cable<br/>
connection. Other people using cable and ethernet are also<br/>
having problems. Now we have to wait for someone to<br/>
figure out what the problem is, which could take days or<br/>
weeks, because the RoadRunner tech people are not<br/>
willing to listen to us or the EQ people telling them<br/>
there is a problem. 8(&lt;br&gt;-Khalista&lt;br&gt;Cleric of Tunare</div>
