<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198838846">First of all, THANKS to the people who helped me<br/>
with my lag problem. The info you gave me worked and I<br/>
REALLY appreciate it!&lt;br&gt;And second, does anyone know<br/>
the price for heavy dragonhorn boots? AC17 agi+9<br/>
svm+5&lt;br&gt;Eqprices says they go for 12,200k and Allakhazam says<br/>
7,500 but... eh.. you know how the prices are online.<br/>
Almost never accurate. And I&#39;m attempting to sale some<br/>
on The Erollisi Marr server and some guy offered me<br/>
1.5k for them but I say someone selling boots that<br/>
aren&#39;t as good as these (have one less stat to all) for<br/>
2.5k&lt;br&gt;So I am stuck =( I&#39;m not sure what to do and I don&#39;t<br/>
want to make a mistake and sell them for too much or<br/>
too less. Any opinions would help me out a lot<br/>
