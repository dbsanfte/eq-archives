<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091651017">Oh yeah, the other bad part about the quest was<br/>
it took 2 enchanted plat bars. Had a friend with<br/>
high CHA buy the bars for 105pp a piece and got them<br/>
enchanted for free, but it was still very expensive as well<br/>
as time consuming, for not so great an item. Plus,<br/>
my poor little level 15 is now in MAJOR debt! LOL</div>
