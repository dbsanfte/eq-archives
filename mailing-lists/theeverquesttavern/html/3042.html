<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207264441">GL and welcome back to Ever Quest! This is the most addictive game I <br/>
personally have ever played. probably because in most games, you buy <br/>
it, play it, defeat it, and move onto the next game. With EQ there <br/>
are events, guildies, and chatting with people from all over the <br/>
world. I&#39;f your ever on &quot;Quellious&quot; feel free to send me a tell. I <br/>
tried other servers and was quickly bored with being a newbie in the <br/>
true sense of the word... LMAO. I hate having to start at the bottom, <br/>
scrape together pp for things because no way in __ I&#39;m begging or <br/>
asking for it, and than meeting new people that usually end up <br/>
quitting EQ or are more interested in hooking up in RL. <br/>
<br/>
If you need help with members to start a guild in the future let me <br/>
know and I&#39;ll create one, leave it there, so you have the amount <br/>
needed. The downside is web design, management, if members fight or <br/>
don&#39;t get long the childish games, and so on... but in the end it can <br/>
feel good to be running your own thing.<br/>

&gt; to buy a plane ticket home from chicago I have gone<br/>
&gt; without EQ for 5 months now, and in 2 months time I<br/>
&gt; will be returning to this wonderful realm under the<br/>
&gt; guise of a warrior.  And If I can pay off a friend of<br/>
&gt; mine IRL I will be starting with a full suit of cobalt<br/>
&gt; armor, so look for the newbie in cobalt on the<br/>

&gt; running again.   Sincerely, PsyKo<br/>
