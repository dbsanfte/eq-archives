<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-734490064">Well said Xela!&lt;br&gt; I myself try not to twink. My<br/>
druid&#39;s items have either been bought, traded or quested<br/>
for. People make fun of me for still using a screaming<br/>
mace at 23. I just upgraded to a cold iron (same delay<br/>
one more damage) and people laugh at that. No sow for<br/>
them I say ;) I may only have 126 wisdom on my<br/>
character, but I can take most things yellow or less down<br/>
usually without resorting to hand to hand, so why care<br/>
what my damage is?</div>
