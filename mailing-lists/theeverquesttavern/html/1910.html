<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842597054">&quot;Be warned, most of the people around here seem<br/>
to be Druids so expect to hear a lot about how great<br/>
Druids are. &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YES! Druids rule, lol.<br/>
=D&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I think you should try the iksar. I&#39;ve never<br/>
played one, but the monks look like they rule. My first<br/>
char was a cleric, and I was a *complete* newbie, so I<br/>
had no clue what I was doing. Luckily, I quickly made<br/>
a good friend (who is now uber, sheesh) and she<br/>
helped me out a LOT. Making friends helps a lot. I think<br/>
reading up on casters realm or something is a good idea,<br/>
but you won&#39;t really know what you like until you&#39;ve<br/>
spent time playing. I&#39;ve found I play healer classes<br/>
best, although I recently started a bard and love her,<br/>
as well.&lt;br&gt;Best wishes with your adventures in<br/>
Norrath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Kanissa Noryk, 35 druid of Norraths Keepers, Rodcet<br/>
Nife&lt;br&gt;~Catallus, the super-twinked bard of Prexus</div>
