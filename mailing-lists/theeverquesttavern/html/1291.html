<div id="ygrps-yiv-882325881">Good Wis Items to look for at low<br/>
levels:&lt;br&gt;Lizardskin Mantle 3wis 3int shoulders- drop from cazic thule<br/>
lizardmen, should be around 100pp, depends on<br/>
server&lt;br&gt;Savant&#39;s Cap 3wis 3int head-drops from reclusive ghoul<br/>
magus in Unrest, fairly regular spawn, but somewhat<br/>
difficult to kill due to his placement in the room, I have<br/>
held 3 of these at one time, gave one to a friend, and<br/>
sold the other for about 65pp if I remember<br/>
right.&lt;br&gt;Platinum Armbands are a good 5 wis, i think... look pretty<br/>
good too, not sure on price, upwards of 175pp each<br/>
though...&lt;br&gt;Best gloves are splitpaw, until you can get ahold of<br/>
some velious stuff, I&#39;ve been very impressed with some<br/>
of it&lt;br&gt;Blackened Iron Medallion is another 3 wis,<br/>
and should be fairly cheap&lt;br&gt;Look into a silver or<br/>
platinum ruby veil.. not really sure on price for each...<br/>
A friend bought a PRV for 500pp once, and another<br/>
spent 750pp..&lt;br&gt;A charred guardian shield is 9wis and<br/>
some AC, again not sure on pricing...&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t know if<br/>
I helped much, but it&#39;s a start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai<br/>
