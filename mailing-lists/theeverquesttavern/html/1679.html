<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438058681">Whatcha been doin&#39;, brother? You&#39;ve missed out on<br/>
what is commonly seen as one of the best starting<br/>
zones in Norrath, our very own Butcherblock Mountains!<br/>
There are at least four quests I can think of off the<br/>
top of my head that a fine young Pally like you could<br/>
do quite easily. Come home!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bone Chips --<br/>
talk to Gunlok Jure in your very own guild; turn in<br/>
bone chips in sets of four for exp and an<br/>
item&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aviak Chick Talons -- go through the door behind<br/>
Gunlok, and give four Aviak Chick talons (they drop off<br/>
of Krag Chicks) to Bumle Reminjar for exp and an<br/>
item&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rat Patrol -- Jeet, one of my guild masters who<br/>
stands next to the bank in Kaladim, will give you exp<br/>
and an item for every four Rat Pelts you turn in. The<br/>
Giant Rats spawn in the mine, on the bridge; if you&#39;re<br/>
lucky, you&#39;ll get the Cleaner VII, which drops metal<br/>
pieces that you can also turn in to Jeet if your faction<br/>
is high enough. Unfortunately, you get a Rogue-only<br/>
no-drop item.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While you&#39;re in the mines, talk to<br/>
Diggins of the Rogues&#39; guild: Diggins says he&#39;ll &quot;maybe<br/>
just maybe&quot; give you a Piercing weapon for 4 Runnyeye<br/>
Warbeads - I think they still drop off of Goblins in<br/>
Butcherblock, even though they&#39;re now Goblins of a different<br/>
clan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve never done this one, but Allakhazam<br/>
says:&lt;br&gt;&quot;Bring Nultal Malfoot in the cleric guild 4 skunk scent<br/>
glands for some experience, money, faction and usually a<br/>
cleric spell. The faction hits for this quest are:<br/>
+ClericsofUnderfoot, +KazonStormhammer, +MinersGuild249.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And<br/>
this is just in Kaladim North, and just a few that<br/>
looked appropriate for your level (if not class). Go<br/>
here for a full list of quests by zone (and send<br/>
Allakhazam some money using PayPal, if you can, it&#39;s a great<br/>
site):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/zlist.html">http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/zlist.html</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/zlist.html&lt;/a">http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/zlist.html&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or, if you&#39;re on the Drinal server, send me a tell<br/>
sometime and I&#39;ll show you around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>

backstabbing, corpse recovery, and Butcherblock Mountains guide<br/>
service</div>
