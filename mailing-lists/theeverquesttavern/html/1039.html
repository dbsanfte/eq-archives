<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565455076">Yes, you need to download the patch before you<br/>
can play the game. As to how long it takes, how fast<br/>
is your modem? My patch takes just seconds to<br/>
download but I am on a cable modem. My buddies takes<br/>
forever and he is on a phone line modem that gets as fast<br/>
as 34k. So depeneding on your modem speed will<br/>
depend on how long it takes to download the patches.</div>
