<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187134991">Here&#39;s my problem. All these people at work told<br/>
me I just _had_ to get EQ..that I would love it. So<br/>
I go out and buy the game almost wetting myself in<br/>
anticipation of playing. I read all the literature and do the<br/>
tutorial and sign up on Sony Station and then...I try to<br/>
connect. Guess what!? I can&#39;t!! I am about to die. So<br/>
maybe you kind folk can help me out. Here&#39;s the message<br/>
I get:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EverQuest file update failed. If the<br/>
problem persists, contact your network administrator or<br/>
internet service provider for<br/>
assistance.&lt;br&gt;(patch.everquest.com:7000TCP) &lt;br&gt;* ERROR *: Access is denied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am<br/>
running DSL. I have also gotten some other host addresses<br/>
from SS to try all of which have failed. Do you got<br/>
any help for an overzealous newbie?</div>
