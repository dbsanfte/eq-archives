<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003209544">well from what ive seen of shadowmen, they have 3<br/>
types. Necro is the one that is holding a book, Cleric<br/>
is icecream cone thingy, and warrior is pretty much<br/>
invis. they all carry shadowed weapons, some of wich are<br/>
no drop, others are...warrior only though. I dont<br/>
think anyone can use them even, since there is no spot<br/>
for race. Pets however can. These are also no rent,<br/>
so if you go ld or log off, they will be gone. I<br/>
have also seen 2 items on them: (Hand of shadow, 1<br/>
charge of grim aura)and(Mask of shadows, 1 charge of<br/>
shadow step) They range from lvl 20 to 25, they will not<br/>
go after you at higher lvls if you havent been<br/>
killing them. But if you kill enough they will attack no<br/>
matter how high you are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor-TA, 40th<br/>
