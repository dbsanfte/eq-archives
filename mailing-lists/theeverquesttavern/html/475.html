<div id="ygrps-yiv-625217349">I have a 16ht lvl WE Ranger, Aslen, and a 14th<br/>
Eur Wizard, both on Xegony. I play mostly Aslen in<br/>
the late evenings (EST).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It too has taken over<br/>
my life. I can&#39;t play in the day because I have a<br/>
family, but I lose a lot of sleep playing :).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
joined a guild early on and that has really helped<br/>
because Xegony is fairly mature and there&#39;s a high<br/>
percentage of high level characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have lots<br/>
of time, the new servers would be good for getting<br/>
items before they are camped too heavily. But I have<br/>
too many friends on Xegony and get their help when<br/>
needed for tps, quests, jewelry making, suggested<br/>
hunting grounds, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best advice I can give is<br/>
pick one server to concentrate on. Then you can build<br/>
good friendships for this kind of help and move stuff<br/>
between your characters. And if you ever want to sell<br/>
your account, it&#39;s much more valuable :).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have<br/>
fun and don&#39;t sacrifice to much of rl for a<br/>
GAME!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John</div>
