<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440891717">OK, it seems that Cazic Thule appeared in LFay<br/>
last night (6/10) on Drinal. I assume this is the same<br/>
thing that has happened on other servers -- Firionia<br/>
Vie comes along, invites four high-level folks to<br/>
help her summon Tunare, and then Cazic Thule appears<br/>
to try to crash the party. There are more details,<br/>
but that&#39;s the gist of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK, now I&#39;m all of<br/>
13th level . . . still looking for something to<br/>
do!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;13th season rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
