<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133734247">You could go with honor loot - people loot<br/>
whenever they think it is their turn. The only problem is<br/>
that casters spend less time meditating and more time<br/>
looting, plus nicer loots are luck-of-the-draw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
prefer master loot for most things. One person loots all<br/>
of the corpses and does a /split 0 0 0 0 (splits all<br/>
of the platinum, gold, silver, and copper pieces<br/>
looted from the mobs killed by the group) whenever<br/>
someone leaves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the nicer items, alpha loot<br/>
works pretty well. The names of the groupmates are<br/>
alphabetized. The group leader assigns a number to each person<br/>
and uses /random 1 x - x being the number of group<br/>
mates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I usually do my best to give preference to the<br/>
classes who can and will use a certain<br/>
item.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example - Gaelle, Shenjairo, Hittue, Autumn, Tristanie,<br/>
and myself are grouped up. A Sionachie&#39;s Partisan<br/>
drops. It&#39;s bard only. Since there are no bards in the<br/>
group, it&#39;s randomed among everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Autumn 1,<br/>
Gaelle 2, Hittue 3, Iskandar 4, Shenjairo 5, Tristanie<br/>
6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/random 1 6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**A magic die has been rolled by<br/>
Iskandar.&lt;br&gt;**It could be any number between 1 and 6, but this<br/>
time it was a 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hittue then gets the<br/>
Sionachie&#39;s Partisan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51 champion of<br/>
Prexus</div>
