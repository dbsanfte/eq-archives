<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253102274">Don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting the Iskar monks<br/>
do less damage than regular.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I know that<br/>
the reason I abandoned the monk I had was b/c the<br/>
money issue hurt badly. And yes, I was saying that that<br/>
was a drawback of all monks. There had been one point<br/>
where someone was asking about what classes and combos<br/>
were good to play. Sounded like a new player. Don&#39;t<br/>
play monk if you don&#39;t want to have to worry about<br/>
money as a newbie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yes, perm sight is<br/>
available. But you have to find the thing. I know that&#39;s an<br/>
item I haven&#39;t seen much of or even seen sold much.<br/>
Except for sometimes in NFP and already having monk cash<br/>
problems-- I couldn&#39;t afford to purchase it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back to<br/>
dual wield. Thanks. Didn&#39;t know humans also get dual<br/>
wield at level 1. But I know that at level 7 with<br/>
nothing more than fists and no special gloves, I was<br/>
doing a lot more damage than my human monk at the same<br/>
level. I can take out even cons with barely a scratch at<br/>
level 7. I went through level 1 to 5 with no equipment<br/>
as an Iskar monk and having never played in Calabis<br/>
in about 2 days, 3 1/2 hours of play. I knew FP and<br/>
my human monk did no where as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the<br/>
conditions where equally equiped monks. Which usually tips<br/>
the favor into Iskar monks. If damage is less for<br/>
Iskar, I haven&#39;t noticed it. My fists (again no weapons,<br/>
no special gloves) do about 1 to 17 per fist<br/>
(average 10) and every 4 or so attacks my other fist<br/>
lands. Sooooo....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless there&#39;s a huge<br/>
difference, I&#39;ve played human monk to level 9 with much<br/>
effort and played maybe at most 6 hours to get to level<br/>
7 monk iskar with no problems. Didn&#39;t even die but<br/>
twice as an Iskar monk and once from mend wound killing<br/>
me when it crit failed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.. keep in mind my level 39 druid has equipment so<br/>
lousy that 4 levels ago, someone asked if I was about<br/>
the delete the character so gave my items away. I<br/>
couldn&#39;t afford to do anything but give my monk 3<br/>
backpacks for his bank.</div>
