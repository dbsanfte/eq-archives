<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567684152">I would think that you might not be able to use<br/>
your old chars on a PS2, but the PS2 would probably<br/>
run faster sense it isn&#39;t running so many programs at<br/>
once (windows, ISP, etc.). I guess it is up to you.<br/>
Remember this though, with the PS2 you can get many other<br/>
games (renting) which you can&#39;t do with the PC,<br/>
usually.</div>
