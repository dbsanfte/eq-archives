<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-143085394">Glad to have you, and glad you will be able to<br/>
play EQ =) Regarding your question on the best<br/>
character to be, it is entirely up to you. There are more<br/>
than 60 race/class combinations that can all be very<br/>
interesting, useful, and fulfilling. In choosing your<br/>
character, consider things like whether you want a fighter,<br/>
a healer, or a caster, or a combination of these.<br/>
Also, choose whether you wish to be a good race or an<br/>
evil race. After deciding these, there are still many<br/>
other choices to choose from. Probably the best thing<br/>
to do if you cannot choose a single character you<br/>
like best is to try a few of them and then decide what<br/>
your favorite is(You have 8 character slots per<br/>
SERVER, meaning you can make more than a hundred<br/>
characters total over various servers ;) ). Keep in mind,<br/>
most classes are very similar at earlier levels, you<br/>
probably won&#39;t recognize the advantages of them for a few<br/>
levels. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;One other thing I wish to mention, don&#39;t<br/>
worry about the statistics and numbers, choose the race<br/>
you like the best despite the fact the stats may seem<br/>
all wrong for the class. Gnomes have the worst stats<br/>
for a cleric than any other race, but I still love<br/>
playing a gnome cleric and I&#39;m just as useful to a group<br/>
as a dwarf cleric =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have fun choosing your<br/>
character, it will effect the rest of your characters life<br/>
so make sure you enjoy it!</div>
