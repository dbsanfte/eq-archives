<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099601634">To check what kind of 3d video card you have<br/>
right click on my computer and go down to properties.<br/>
Then click on device manager, then double click on<br/>
display adapters it will tell you the video card you<br/>
have. I have a Compaq for a old computer and I think<br/>
your prob might be your video card. From what I have<br/>
seen compaq gives the worst cards with there computers<br/>
and you cant upgrade them. Or you can upgrade them<br/>
but not alot I still have a new TnT 2 card in the box<br/>
that would not go into my compaq. And your computer<br/>
can run Ultima Online fine because that game doesnt<br/>
require much to play. I used to play UO for a really<br/>
short time but never got into it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The group<br/>
thing is another person asking you to group with them.<br/>
To join the group click on main and then push follow<br/>
or you can hit disband which will reject the offer<br/>
to join the group. Also if you want to start a group<br/>
target the person you want in group and push<br/>
invite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this somewhat helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;omm</div>
