<b>Subject:</b> crazy lag <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-855786700">Yesturday i was playing on veeshan server and<br/>
there was insane amounts of lag, i got disconnected 2<br/>
times. the second time was in crushbone on trainer hill,<br/>
i was with a party too! i just hope someone is<br/>
there when i log back in cause the trainer conned red<br/>
to me and i was right next to the fire where he<br/>
spawns...and i just made level 7.</div>
