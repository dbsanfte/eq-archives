<div id="ygrps-yiv-993733496">&quot;Does anyone have any info on these<br/>
rat-bast**ds?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What you probably encountered was a group of GM&#39;s out<br/>
for fun...I once saw&#39;em show up as a family of named<br/>
Aviaks. They wreck havoc and shout things and basically<br/>
have a grand ole time for a while. Depending on how<br/>
freaked out you get about dying it can be a rather<br/>
amusing event...on the rare occassion it happens on<br/>
Povar...the upper levels that get wind of it will race over<br/>
for a chance to whack on a GM :)&lt;br&gt;In any case BB<br/>
should be as safe as it ever was now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yodwynn</div>
