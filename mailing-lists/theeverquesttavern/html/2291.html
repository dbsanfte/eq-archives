<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117426194">With my 56k modem it took us approximately 25<br/>
hours to download. That&#39;s with give or take 2 hours for<br/>
times we disconnected for phone use. &lt;br&gt;Personally,<br/>
though I love the game, I find it very unprofessional<br/>
and disrespective of those without high speed<br/>
connections. I paid for all the system requirements, the<br/>
expansion, etc.&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t have DSL nor the cable modem<br/>
available in my area. I was caught between a rock and hard<br/>
place where this patch was concerned.&lt;br&gt;Sad&lt;br&gt;Jessica</div>
