<div id="ygrps-yiv-244153824">Very interesting, Shooman, thanks. I just started<br/>
grouping in earnest once I got backstab, and I&#39;ve been in<br/>
Unrest for the last couple of levels. Nice thing there<br/>
is that it&#39;s small enough that you see the same<br/>
people regularly, so you can group with them and learn<br/>
their style. Or learn what you don&#39;t like about them.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s also a thread on groups on the Everlore Rogue<br/>
board. Not nearly so erudite (!) as your post, but fun.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me know if/when (I hope it&#39;s &quot;when&quot;) you get back<br/>
to Everquest. Would love to meet you in-game some<br/>
day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;15th season<br/>
