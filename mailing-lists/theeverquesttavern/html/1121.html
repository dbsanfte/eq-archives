<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015872738">DING!!!Level 7 in 1 minute(using CB belts,of<br/>
course)! You&#39;ve never truly felt the wrath of the orcs<br/>
until you see a train in CB.Example:I was bored so I<br/>
went to go kill a little orc pawn for amusement.As I&#39;m<br/>
bonking the bejesus out of him with my cracked staff he<br/>
runs to the slave camp part of crush bone and tells 2<br/>
legionaires(supposedly his parents)&quot;Mom,Dad!Dreevil was trying to take<br/>
my CB belt!&quot;I ran like hell from the con red<br/>
legionaires as the orc children(pawns)threw rocks and sticks<br/>
at me,&quot;It&#39;s the belt stealer,get im&#39;!&quot;&lt;br&gt;I ran up<br/>
some hills,to the entrance(by this time I had added<br/>
about 3 more orcs to the already 5 chasing me)and as I<br/>
ran by I caught a glimpse of Emperor Crush and his<br/>
royal guards with the bodies of almost everyone of the<br/>
zone on the floor.I run,jump through the zone...and<br/>
make it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Moral:Don&#39;t kill it if it&#39;s near<br/>
it&#39;s parents!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dreevil&lt;br&gt;High Elf&lt;br&gt;4th Level<br/>
