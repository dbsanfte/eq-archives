  Apologies if any of you all get this  more than once but I wanted to let you<br/>
  all know that I will be offline until approximately Thursday.  I have to<br/>
  move this weekend and won&#39;t have internet access until ATTBI/Comcast<br/>
  switches  over to the new abode.  This move is a bit  on short notice for me<br/>
  (i.e. I found out yesterday) and Luckily a fellow SCA member had an empty<br/>
  room.<br/>
