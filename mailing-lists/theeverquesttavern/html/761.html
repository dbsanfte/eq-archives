<b>Subject:</b> Kinool&#39;s Favor. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053002730">I was just wondering if anyone here knew about<br/>
the favor that Kinool Goldsinger asks you to do for<br/>
him? Kinool is the Enchanter&#39;s Guild Headman in<br/>
Felwithe. He asks you to do him a favor, and when you ask<br/>
him about it, he says&#39;&quot;Nevermind, I really should do<br/>
it myself.&quot; Does anyone have any info about it? I<br/>
couldn&#39;t find anything about it on AllaKhazam&#39;s site.<br/>
Thanks.</div>
