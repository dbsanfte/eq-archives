<div id="ygrps-yiv-176706187">Hi. I am doing a report/speech on EQ in school,<br/>
and I wondered if you guys could give me any advice<br/>
on it. The class it&#39;s for is seventh grade<br/>
Introduction to Public Speaking, and it is supposed to be an<br/>
informative speech. I need to create an outline, and put<br/>
ideas on notecards and give the speech in an<br/>
extemporaneous manner. I am also supposed to use visual aids. If<br/>
you have any good info, and/or ideas that will help<br/>
me out, they&#39;re greately appreciated. You can reply<br/>
to this message, I recieve the club messages by<br/>
email, or email me directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:safritz@...">safritz@...</a> Thanks a<br/>
bunch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andalite_14</div>
