<div id="ygrps-yiv-696887034">Well, this is freakin&#39; annoying.  There&#39;s evidently a limit on the <br/>
size of messages posted here, but they don&#39;t tell you that, and then <br/>
don&#39;t post the message if it&#39;s too large.  This is my third try to <br/>
post this, so let me break it up.  Heaven forbid we ask people to <br/>
read too much at once, hey?<br/>
<br/>
OK, let&#39;s see what we can do here.  First thing, if you haven&#39;t <br/>
already, you should visit the official EQ Tech Support page: go to <br/>
http://eqlive.station.sony.com, click on Technical Help on the left.<br/>
<br/>
First, your processor.  A Pentium II 200 MHz will not cut it, so that <br/>
would be the basic problem.  Your RAM should come in 64 or 32 MB <br/>
increments, so you probably have 128, 192, or 256 MB.  You could have <br/>
224, but that would be an odd amount; if it&#39;s cobbled together using <br/>
different kinds of RAM, that could also be a problem (but not one <br/>
that would prevent you from running EQ).<br/>
<br/>
At 256 MB of RAM, if you&#39;re running the Luclin expansion, you will <br/>
only be able to use about half the new models.  <br/>
<br/>
Win NT and Linux are different operating systems - you probably have <br/>
Windows 95, 98, or XP.  I hope you have Windows 98, because Windows <br/>
95 does not support DirectX 8.1, which you need to run the new <br/>
graphics engine.  That could be your basic problem, either that or <br/>
the processor.<br/>
<br/>
Required specs, from the Official Sony page:<br/>
<br/>
Windows┬« 98/2000/ME/XP  &lt;---- Need to check this.<br/>
Pentium┬« II 400Mhz or greater &lt;----------------<br/>
256 MB RAM <br/>
16 MB Direct3D compliant video card  &lt;--- Your card is fine.<br/>
DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card  &lt;------ ??<br/>
28.8k (or faster) Internet connection <br/>
4X speed CD-ROM <br/>
450 MB+ hard drive space  &lt;---- HD is OK, unless you&#39;ve already <br/>
filled it with stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Although technically below the minimum specs, players with 128 <br/>
MB of RAM will still be able to run Luclin by turning off the new <br/>
character models. <br/>
<br/>
Recommended Specs:<br/>
<br/>
Windows┬« 98/2000/ME/XP <br/>
Pentium┬« III or greater <br/>
512 MB RAM <br/>
32 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&L (i.e. ATI Radeon <br/>
or Nvidia GeForce 2 or greater) <br/>
DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card <br/>
56.6k (or faster) Internet connection <br/>
16X speed CD-ROM <br/>
1.5 GB+ hard drive space<br/>
<br/>
Note: DirectX 8.1 or greater is required for Windows 98 ,XP, ME, and <br/>
2k. <br/>
