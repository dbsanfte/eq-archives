<div id="ygrps-yiv-504384123">I don&#39;t think that you would have to worry about looking odd.  There <br/>
are plenty of newbies on even now.  I am going to start up again soon <br/>
myself from about a six month break.  I am lookinh forward to <br/>
starting from level one again that was half the fun o the game to me <br/>
working my way up in levels :o)  What server are you going to play <br/>
on?  I would recomend E&#39;c as I played that one when I was a total <br/>
newbie and found the people great and very helpfull.<br/>
