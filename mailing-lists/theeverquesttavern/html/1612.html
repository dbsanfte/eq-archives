<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782027909">Now.. as much against selling accounts as I am, I<br/>
will let that part of this slide. As for my major<br/>
concern, do you have any idea how many problems whoever<br/>
buys the 52 Paladin would have? Unless this person<br/>
happens to have a 52 or close paladin, he would die over<br/>
and over again... especially on a PvP server... I&#39;m<br/>
sorry, but I for one am going to pass on this (not like<br/>
I considered it) and I advise everyone else to do<br/>
the same. It creates a potentially dangerous<br/>
situation to the buyer, anyone the character knows, and<br/>
anyone who may group with said character.</div>
