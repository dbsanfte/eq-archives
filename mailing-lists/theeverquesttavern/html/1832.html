<div id="ygrps-yiv-603365646">It is so nice to have caught up to a lot of the<br/>
&quot;twinkers&quot; finally. At lvl 33, I have a bunch of items that<br/>
I worked hard for (including the Testament of<br/>
Vanear, which can&#39;t be used to twink!!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think<br/>
non-twinks work harder and become better players because<br/>
things aren&#39;t handed to them easily. Especially druids--<br/>
lower level twinked druids can melee anything up to a<br/>
certain level, and then they&#39;re screwed because they<br/>
haven&#39;t perfected druid strategyies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At lvl 16,<br/>
don&#39;t be discouraged. I think i was decked out in all<br/>
leather armor, with a piar of Derv Rings I go myself in<br/>
NRo, one +3WIS earring i was given, and a pair of SP<br/>
Hide Gloves I bought with all the money I had at the<br/>
time (17pp). Now that I have just about all the items<br/>
I think I&#39;ll need for awhile, WIS of 179 and about<br/>
1kpp in the bank (with all my lvl 34 spells already<br/>
bought), I look back and laugh at how tough it was!!! Your<br/>
time will come...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fight on!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
