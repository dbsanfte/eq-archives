<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883059689">...or better dying in Befallen is an<br/>
art...&lt;br&gt;Yep went into Befallen this night. We had a small<br/>
group and I never been there. I did read up a bit but I<br/>
trusted on the other players there and their judgement on<br/>
what to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We fought a couple of things and XP<br/>
seemed good until one guy got mauled outside of the room<br/>
where we were. He tells the party help so we rush<br/>
out... but the more we slaughtered the more got undead<br/>
joined the feast, I guess we had all the second floor on<br/>
us...&lt;br&gt;Xaiver my buddy went LD and died. Our cleric ran Paladin<br/>
died and then there where only two left. A Dark Elf<br/>
necro (Zole) and lil&#39;ol&#39;me. I had two bubs left and<br/>
knew I was going to die (3 zombies 4 greater skeletons<br/>
and a necro acolites pet) So Zole tells me run I&#39;ll<br/>
try to gate. I say I don&#39;t know the way I&#39;m going to<br/>
die you back of and gate. Which he did and seconds<br/>
later I died.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in Nektulos forrest as I&#39;m<br/>
still bound to my start point. So quickly memming my<br/>
spells, hopping to the bank to pick up my spare weapon.<br/>
And back to Befallen. Once there they sent the<br/>
Paladin, who in the mean time got his body back, up to<br/>
fetch me. We went down and yes, another train on us!<br/>
Paly forgot to get Invis vs undead when he came up. So<br/>
in no time 2 of us died again. Xaiver told me to get<br/>
my corpse first but I saw he was alone against a<br/>
mummy and a greater skeleton. He was down to two<br/>
bubbles of health and If he was going to die I would<br/>
stand no change alone so I started hacking. We got them<br/>
down in a nick of time and our cleric showed up just<br/>
at that time too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunatly we had a<br/>
repeat of the first little misshap just five minutes<br/>
later. Party got wiped out except for the cleric who ran<br/>
to safty and the necro who stayed till the last<br/>
posible moment and gated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So there I was in<br/>
Nektulos again. Without my spare weapon. Memming spells,<br/>
putting Invis VS Undead on and back to Befallen again.<br/>
Luckely I did not get jumped by a Young Kodiak and made<br/>
it back to Befallen in one piece... Only to be<br/>
abandoned by my party!!!!!&lt;br&gt;The cleric left the group,<br/>
the paladin simply said we&#39;ll i&#39;m of to Oasis and<br/>
they went! Only one loyal enough to help me and Xaiver<br/>
was Zole out necromancer. Again, this was my and also<br/>
Xaiver&#39;s first time there and these guys knew it. We tried<br/>
to get to our corpses. But when we got to mine first<br/>
and I tried to drag it as far away from anny undead<br/>
as I could, we got jumped. We expected it of course<br/>
but damn there were too many on us at once.... So I<br/>
died... Xaiver died... Zole died...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back again in<br/>
Nektulos.... Well in the end Zole logged on as his higher<br/>
level druid cleared out the place got me and Xaiver, we<br/>
looted our boddies and he ported us out. So in the end I<br/>
got as much XP going into Befallen as i got comming<br/>
out despite all the killing we did. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yargon<br/>
