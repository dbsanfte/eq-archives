<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902713302">Ok, I find this reply funny because I&#39;m a lvl 48<br/>
druid on Bristlebane and I just recently got my wisdom<br/>
up to 48. Granted, I spend most of my time fighting<br/>
and not questing as me much so I&#39;ve havent spent alot<br/>
of time trying to get my wisdom as high as it could<br/>
be. But I find it funny that yours is 179 at lvl 34<br/>
untwinked. Oh well. You will be able to quad kite easy at<br/>
that lvl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keleborne</div>
