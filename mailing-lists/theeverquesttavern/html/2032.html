<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235142236">I stopped playing EQ for 9 months. I really<br/>
didn&#39;t keep up with it other than checking message<br/>
boards from time to time. I have a 35 monk on quellious<br/>
and a 24 cleric on E&#39;ci. What you need to do is find<br/>
some groups in the karana not sure which one it is.<br/>
North i think. Get in a group outside paw at the spires<br/>
and kill gnoles. Awesome exp and loot and most of all<br/>
if your in a group you have a greater chance of<br/>
living and having fun.</div>
