<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046693855">Yesterday while heading out to Kedge for a guild<br/>
raid, I had an encounter with ... Bilge Farfathom! I<br/>
had targeted him, but he ran off somewhere before I<br/>
had a chance to cast a spell. Frantically I searched<br/>
the zone, hoping to pick up his tracks... After about<br/>
5 minutes of searching, I decided to enlist the<br/>
help of a few guildmates (who were near the Unrest<br/>
zone) to help. While running toward them, I picked up<br/>
Bilge on tracking!! I engaged him with a Drifting Death<br/>
spell, and 2 firestrikes later, I was the proud owner of<br/>
a PEARL KEDGE TOTEM! =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those who don&#39;t<br/>
know: Bilge is a very rare spawn in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron,<br/>
and the Pearl Kedge Totem is the very rare<br/>
drop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Kanadin Starchaser, humble druid of Tunare, lvl<br/>
