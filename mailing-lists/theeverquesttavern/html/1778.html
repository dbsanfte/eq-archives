<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764438477">Okay, listen up. This is a MAJOR RANT that<br/>
contains course language directed towards spell casters,<br/>
so if you&#39;re a spell caster and you get your<br/>
feelings hurt easily, don&#39;t keep reading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Listen up<br/>
you stupid sons of bitches who call yourselves &quot;Spell<br/>
Casters&quot; or &quot;Magic Users&quot;, END YOUR LIVES.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was<br/>
hunting in Unrest tonight in a group on Xev that was made<br/>
up of 4 spell casters and 2 tanks. I was one of<br/>
those tanks. Now, I know you spell casters have to sit<br/>
on your asses and look at your fucking books often<br/>
so you can regenerate your mana to cast your crap<br/>
spells that do little to nothing, but when your tank is<br/>
getting his ass beaten by a werebat STAND UP YOU STUPID<br/>
MORON. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&#39;re in the &quot;Round Room&quot; camping and the<br/>
other tank (being an idiot who was born to be a<br/>
spellcaster) pulls a ghoul (approx lvl 10) and a werebat<br/>
(approx lvl 20). So, what do the spell casters and the<br/>
moron tank do? They attack the ghoul and leave me with<br/>
the werebat! So I swear at them and the tank comes<br/>
and helps me out. We&#39;re both getting hit for about<br/>
50-70 hp a shot by this thing, so what do the spell<br/>
casters do? Shout &quot;OOM!&quot; and sit down. The werebat hits<br/>
the other tank for like 100 points and he dies.<br/>
Leaving me with 25% health. The healer starts to heal the<br/>
wizard (80% health) who was hurt during the attack with<br/>
the ghoul. I, trying to give the stupid spellcasters<br/>
a hint run behind them to try to get the werebat to<br/>
hit them. But he doesn&#39;t and knocks me unconcious<br/>
right next to them. They&#39;re all standing now, but don&#39;t<br/>
move in to take the hit so I can live, no they let the<br/>
werebat kill me. So I go back to Kaladim, and then I see<br/>
the group message &quot;Wow that werebat gave good<br/>
experience.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went absolutely fucking<br/>
nuts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LISTEN UP MORONS: I UNDERSTAND YOU DON&#39;T HAVE AS MUCH<br/>
HIT POINTS AS US, BUT IF YOUR TANK IS UNCONCIOUS ON<br/>
THE FLOOR, STEP FORWARD AND TAKE A DAMN HIT. I KNOW<br/>
YOUR BUSY STARING AT YOUR STUPID BOOK, BUT GET OFF<br/>
YOUR ASSES AND DO SOME DAMN WORK. ONE HIT ISN&#39;T GOING<br/>
TO KILL YOU, AND IT WOULD GIVE TIME FOR THE STUPID<br/>
HEALER TO GET A FUCKING CLUE AND HEAL ME. I KNOW IT<br/>
TAKES LIKE AN IQ OF 10 TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND MOST<br/>
SPELL CASTERS DONT HAVE THAT IQ, SO I&#39;LL SPELL IT OUT<br/>
FOR YOU.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T A K E A F U C K I N G H I T!&lt;br&gt;YOU<br/>
STUPID MORON!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m done ranting now and feel a lot<br/>
better.</div>
