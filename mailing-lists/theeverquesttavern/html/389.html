<div id="ygrps-yiv-507267255">Hmm...what do you mean by warrior-mage? One who<br/>
is proficient in both melee battle and spellcasting?<br/>
All the classes in Everquest are quite balanced to<br/>
some extent, and the closest things to warrior-mages<br/>
are hybrid classes (i.e. Paladin, Ranger,<br/>
Shadowknight). Paladins are a combo of a warrior and a cleric;<br/>
ranger is warrior/druid, and SK is warrior/necromancer.<br/>
Keep in mind that hybrids are at least 75% warrior.<br/>
Clerics and druids are considered to be &quot;priest&quot; types,<br/>
and the necro is a mage type. If you plan on<br/>
powerleveling your character through the early levels, the<br/>
shadowknight will be the mosty difficult, and the ranger will<br/>
be the easiest. Go Rangers!! woohoo =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -<br/>
