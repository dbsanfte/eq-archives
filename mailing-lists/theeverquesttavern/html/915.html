<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-123963497">Just had to share the news!! I just made lvl 8, I<br/>
am a dark elf enchanter, My lvl 8 and lvl 12 pet<br/>
spells are both in High Hold Keep, Last night, I went<br/>
and made it through the pass, and into the keep, and<br/>
got both spells, (and a few more to sell for money)<br/>
without dying! and if you are wondering why i am so<br/>
excited, it&#39;s because I&#39;m KOS and most of the de<br/>
enchanters that I know died many times.&lt;br&gt;Myystical</div>
