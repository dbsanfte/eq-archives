<div id="ygrps-yiv-870563554">Thanks for the help Sadia and everyone else!! I<br/>
hadn&#39;t thought about getting to OT through Oasis. I had<br/>
planned to make the boring boat trip back to BB, and<br/>
start from there to Firiona Vie. Good Advice!! My<br/>
ranger friend and I joined a group last night at the<br/>
Zone ent in Lake Rathe. made it 1/2 way to lvl 19 in<br/>
just 2 1/2 hours of constant battle. Between loot<br/>
splits, I made about 10pp, and also picked up the skull<br/>
that gives you +40 mana and +5 Mag resist. (i think --<br/>
can&#39;t remember it&#39;s name right now). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aviak<br/>
groups were in their low to mid 20s with no room for a<br/>
still lvl 18 druid and ranger. We soloed some yellow<br/>
aviaks on the plains of SK, but they hit pretty hard. We<br/>
had nearly taken down one yellow, when a red joined<br/>
in. UGH -- my first time in SK, and I was trying to<br/>
find the Lake Rathe zone!!!! Good think I had SOW, and<br/>
got a snare off. I waited at the zone to Rathe for my<br/>
freind, and then saw an ominous and foreboding message--<br/>
&quot;Your snare spell has worn off&quot; - TIME TO ZONE!!!!<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This club is pretty good - but i&#39;ve noticed a lot of<br/>
druids posting here. We have more/better tales than<br/>
bards these days!!! Pretty soon, Verant will have to<br/>
let us pick of a mandolin!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela (Orcbane or<br/>
BearFreind or Wolfsire-- can&#39;t decide yet -- hehe)&lt;br&gt;Druid<br/>

Tunare, on Xev</div>
