<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099997764">I&#39;ve never heard the term, but I would suspect<br/>
either (a) Druids, or (b) Wizards. Because either one<br/>
can take you to the far ends of Norrath with little<br/>
problem. Like the Druid who cast levitate, invis, and SoW<br/>
on us to take us safely through Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron.<br/>
Goblins? What Goblins? And this was at 14th level -- later<br/>
they can teleport between those Druid-Ring things.<br/>
Wizards, too. Don&#39;t both get Group Gate<br/>
eventually?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim, waiting for war&lt;br&gt;13th season<br/>
rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
