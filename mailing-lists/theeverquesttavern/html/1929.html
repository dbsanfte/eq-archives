<div id="ygrps-yiv-836062823">I think playing monks is really easy. You can<br/>
level like twice as fast as a caster cause you never<br/>
have to wait for mana. I have a level 22 human monk, I<br/>
never wanted to start a iksar one. I think there are to<br/>
many iksar monks out there. Plus most iksar monks are<br/>
twinks anyway. A few days ago I saw a level 17 monk with<br/>
a jade mace, cane of tranquil and a fungi robe.<br/>
They only real bad thing about human monks is there<br/>
night blind other than that there good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien</div>
