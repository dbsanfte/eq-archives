<b>Subject:</b> Re: Benefits/Downfalls of Monks? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-408575933">I&#39;ve discovered that with monks-- you just don&#39;t<br/>
earn enough money to properly venture forth. Carry<br/>
weight heavily penalizes you. I abandoned my monk for<br/>
later play when I can afford to say... &quot;No loot for me<br/>
plz&quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskar monk at level 7 and I was carrying<br/>
all the stuff I could b/c I&#39;m a poor boy.<br/>
Heh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway... you&#39;re right. It&#39;s a hard class to play to me b/c<br/>
of the money issues. But you hit often with a monk<br/>
and can mend (which has caused myself to die before<br/>
though... OUCH-- crit fails on mend STINK!).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway... every class has its ups and downs. I like<br/>
warriors vs Monks b/c Warriors can take hits... but monks<br/>
are nice damage. And they&#39;ve got a really nice AC<br/>
bonus for being under 14 stone. (not that I used that<br/>
really. Sigh... darned I&#39;m a poor character.<br/>
LOL)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out... aka FatedHue Druid of Drinal in his 22nd<br/>
Rank.</div>
