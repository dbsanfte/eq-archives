<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018956556">I think you should be okay starting up again in EQ.  On the Saryrn server<br/>
you will encounter some tweaking of alternates, but I found new players in<br/>
the newbie zones all the time.<br/>
<br/>
You will find helpful players running through and helping out at the oddest<br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
I have been out of the game for about 6 months, but working on justifying<br/>
the funds to get back into the game myself.<br/>
<br/>
Should you choose to start playing again and wind up on the Saryrn server,<br/>
give a shout out to the Ring of Shadows guild members if you need help or<br/>
are looking for group members.  They are a helpful guild and are not full of<br/>
high level characters too busy to take a night and help new players (even<br/>
old experienced players coming back into the game).  They are not an uber<br/>
guild, but have been established on the server since it was brought up from<br/>
the Veeshan split.<br/>
<br/>
I am rambling now, so I will stop and get back to work on justifying my<br/>
return....heh...heh...<br/>

Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I need some help on my next MPORPG purchase. I played EQ since Beta<br/>
and quit about 2 and half years ago (college took priority heh) and<br/>
now that I have secured a somewhat stable career, I&#39;m planning to hit<br/>
online RPGing again. Question is, being that EQ has been out for 5<br/>
years, is it too late to come back and start anew? Meaning am I going<br/>
to look ridiculous (prolly will regardless) being the only lvl 6 guy<br/>
on the server in cloth and using fine steel? Realistically, I&#39;m<br/>
assuming after all of these years a large percentage of the players<br/>
have either progressed to upper echelon in levels, or populated with<br/>
tweeked alternates. Should I be looking at another MPORPG like<br/>
Camelot (a bit more recent)? Suggestions are appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
Yager<br/>
