<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452342723">Hehe, on the Mithaniel Marr server, I was hunting<br/>
in BB and found a gnoll brewer, which was blue to<br/>
me. Hehe, I knew the story behind those rare-spawns<br/>
so a killed it! To my luck I found a BB cask on it,<br/>
which I still didn&#39;t know hoe to do the BBstout quest<br/>
yet. So...I figured I could find out later! The next<br/>
day someone said over the zone that he wanted to buy<br/>
the BBcask desparately! So I asked how much you<br/>
willing to pay? He said A WHOPPING 100PP (fairly good for<br/>
a lvl 13 bard hehe) So I said fine! Sold it! Got my<br/>
money! Then BOOM! I was rich! Also that same day I<br/>
recieved a Chitin Shield, a PGT, and elf-hide gloves, all<br/>
absolutely FREE! =) Oh my, what a day lol!</div>
