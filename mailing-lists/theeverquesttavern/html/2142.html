<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628164616">ok, here&#39;s what i&#39;ve tried since...i installed<br/>
the aol 7.0 (simply because someone in here said it<br/>
helped them) and i de-reinstalled the game, redownloaded<br/>
all the patches...and still nothing!!! ok, it gets<br/>
the patches (and that takes hours because my<br/>
connection is so-so) and as soon as i hit &quot;play online&quot; it<br/>
just doesn&#39;t do anything, no warning, message, the<br/>
game will not load. is it possible that i don&#39;t have<br/>
enough memory if i have a 4G HD? i mean, i have 2G&#39;s<br/>
left so that shouldn&#39;t matter right? man i am<br/>
stumped...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;anyone, any ideas?????</div>
