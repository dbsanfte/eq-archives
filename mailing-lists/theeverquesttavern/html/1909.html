<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037214493">If you go to www.castersrealm.com they have some<br/>
very good suggestions as to race/class. Follow the<br/>
link to the class, and then select the class creation<br/>
guide link. In this guide they also give you<br/>
suggestions on how to apply your bonus points to your base<br/>
stats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A friend of mine created an DE SK and didn&#39;t apply<br/>
anything to STR. At lvl 19, he ended up deleting and<br/>
restarting this character... If he had visited<br/>
&#39;www.castersrealm.com&#39; first, he would have gotten it right the first<br/>
time.</div>
