<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015041996">Druids and Wizards are commonly referred to as<br/>
&quot;taxis&quot; because of their teleport spells. Usually,<br/>
however, the term is applies to those Druids and wizzies<br/>
that spend a LOT of time teleporting for cash. 10pp a<br/>
seat, for most normal rings/spires, is about right. Hot<br/>
spots like the Dreadlands, Eastern Wastes, etc. cost<br/>
more because of the level needed to teleport there and<br/>
the difficulty once you&#39;ve arrived. NEVER try to TP<br/>
to Dreadlands until you&#39;re 35+. Even then you&#39;re<br/>
going to have some problems when you<br/>
arrive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral Stormfang</div>
