Witches school casts spell on Alps<br/>

KLAGENFURT, Austria (Reuters) - You won&#39;t learn how to fly a <br/>
broomstick or cast spells with the flick of a wand, but a potent dose <br/>
of grit and study will turn you into a witch, promises Europe&#39;s first <br/>
School of Witchcraft. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The school in the southern Austrian city of Klagenfurt might sound <br/>
hocus-pocus, but those looking to emulate fictional young wizard <br/>
Harry Potter (news - web sites) will be a mite disappointed: the <br/>
curriculum is downright scientific, and eye of newt is nowhere to be <br/>
seen. <br/>
<br/>
Headmaster Andreas Starchel, who prefers to be called by his druid <br/>
name Danaketh, said he established the school to demystify witchcraft <br/>
by explaining phenomena using scientific methods from physics, <br/>
chemistry, and biology. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everything that is taught and learned at our school can be proven <br/>
using natural scientific and psychological methods,&quot; he told Reuters <br/>
during a training session in the woods. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We teach everything needed to become a real witch in the historical <br/>
sense -- that is to have an all-encompassing knowledge of nature and <br/>
a highly developed sense of intuition. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Being a witch is not inborn. Anyone can learn to become one,&quot; he <br/>
added. <br/>
<br/>
Practitioners of witchcraft focus on the good in life and the spirit, <br/>
and reject any connection with the devil, Starchel said. <br/>
<br/>
Since their beliefs date back to ancient times well before the birth <br/>
of Jesus, witchcraft has no bond with the Christian embodiment of <br/>
evil. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Witchcraft has got absolutely nothing to do with the folklore image <br/>
of evil witches with green faces and warts on their nose. It&#39;s about <br/>
becoming a rounded person who lives in harmony with nature,&quot; said the <br/>
goatee-bearded druid. <br/>
<br/>
NO HOCUS-POCUS NOR HUNKUM BUNKUM <br/>
<br/>
The headmaster stressed that his school, established in 1998 for <br/>
wannabe witches and druids of 18 years and above, has no ties with <br/>
religious organisations nor follows any esoteric movement. <br/>
<br/>
The syllabus originally lasted three years but has now been revised <br/>
to a more flexible form to suit students&#39; busy time schedules. In a <br/>
sign of the times, it teaches courses over the Internet as most of <br/>
its students live outside Austria. <br/>
<br/>
A student graduates with a venefica or veneficus (from the Latin for <br/>
witch/druid) certificate after passing written exams in seven modules <br/>
and submitting a final thesis. <br/>
<br/>
The first module focuses on awakening intuition, specifically on how <br/>
to find sources of energy in nature and how to channel it. Other <br/>
modules are astronomy, astrology, botany, holistic healing and ritual <br/>
magic. <br/>
<br/>
Curriculum information on the school website www.hexen-schule.de <br/>
shows there are no modules like the Defence Against the Dark Arts <br/>
class which Harry Potter had to take in the Hogwarts School of <br/>
Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some wannabe witches and druids are turned off enrolling with us <br/>
when we tell them that our aim is to demystify witchcraft,&quot; said <br/>
Starchel, who is an information technology specialist by profession. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;People do approach us hoping to learn how to fly on a broomstick. <br/>
Then we have to disappoint them and explain that it&#39;s much more <br/>
important to let the spirit fly -- to be able to combine intellect <br/>
with the soul.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The school has received a huge fillip from the Harry Potter books by <br/>
J.K. Rowling (news - web sites) and television series such as Sabrina <br/>
the Teenage Witch. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We actually had kids phoning up asking whether they could ditch <br/>
their school and enrol with us,&quot; Starchel said. <br/>
<br/>
THE WITCHES OF KLAGENFURT <br/>
<br/>
Student witch Katharina, a bespectacled middle-aged librarian by day <br/>
who asked to be identified only by her witch name, said she was drawn <br/>
to the course because something was missing from her life. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was looking for direction. Christianity was too narrow for me and <br/>
didn&#39;t give me the answers I needed,&quot; she said after completing a <br/>
session of chakra meditation with Danaketh. <br/>
<br/>
Chakras are the seven key energy centres of the body according to <br/>
Indian medicine. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was a bit sceptical at first but what impressed me is that it&#39;s <br/>
not about belief or faith as in the church. The school offers <br/>
plausible explanations for phenomena based on fact -- there&#39;s no <br/>
hocus-pocus,&quot; Katharina said. <br/>
<br/>
Katharina, who travels from Salzburg in the northwest of the country <br/>
to attend the school&#39;s seminars, proudly shows off an array of <br/>
bottles, vials and flasks with home-brewed potions, elixirs and <br/>
fragrant creams with which she treats her friends. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;At first my friends and family ridiculed me for wanting to become a <br/>
witch. But now they come to me for one of my potions to soothe a <br/>
cough or whatever,&quot; she said. <br/>
<br/>
Like Katharina, aspiring witch Saltah embraced the craft three years <br/>
ago due to a thirst for knowledge. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It started off as curiosity about mushrooms and herbs, but then I <br/>
realised that I simply wanted answers to so many things I couldn&#39;t <br/>
comprehend and that this school could provide me with them,&quot; said <br/>
Saltah, who is in her mid-20s. <br/>
<br/>
Both women said the course was challenging intellectually as <br/>
witchcraft covered a swath of subjects. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just learning and completing the syllabus doesn&#39;t make you a witch. <br/>
You&#39;ve got to work at it day in day out,&quot; Saltah said. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s going to take me another 20 years before I can truly call <br/>
myself a witch,&quot; said Katharina, hunched over a toadstool. <br/>
