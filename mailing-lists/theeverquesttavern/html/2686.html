<b>Subject:</b> Question about all this new stuff... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238573169">Ok so it&#39;s been quite a few many months since I was able to play on <br/>
a regular basis. (How I did it with a regular phone connection I&#39;ll <br/>
never know!) Anyway, now that I am playing I have noticed a LOT of <br/>
new stuff. My lvl 10 (now) Ench was playing in Black Burrow in the <br/>
wee hours this morning and I kept getting Ruined Gnoll Leather stuff <br/>
(like gloves, wristbands etc...) Someone said that this is for a <br/>
Druid, Ranger quest? If this is does anyone know how it works? I ask <br/>
czause I have a druid and I&#39;d like to get her some decent stuff <br/>
maybe. Anyway, thanks for the info if you have it. The Raven</div>
