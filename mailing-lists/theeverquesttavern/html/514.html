<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718831575">Hiya Yodwynn, nice to meet you. I play 3<br/>
characters on Solusex Ro, ok can&#39;t spell it that well..hehe.<br/>
I have a lvl 25 Barbarian Warrior, lvl 19 Paladin<br/>
and a lvl 17 Bard. I&#39;ve been playing eq since it came<br/>
out so really my warrior should be much higher..but<br/>
alas RL took me away from the game for a bit. Talk<br/>
about eq withdrawal. I had it big time.. :) Ok just<br/>
wanted to say hiya and welcome.</div>
