<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062991077">Um, here are a few possibilities: <br/>
<br/>
1) Ask your guild (Dragon&#39;s Honor, I assume).  Do a /who GUILD all <br/>
and see where in the old world the other folks close to your level <br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
2) Go to www.eqatlas.com and click on the Hunting Guide by level.   <br/>
Will give you maps and the complete run-down on what to expect in a <br/>
zone.  <br/>
<br/>
3) Off the top of my head, Unrest, Befallen and Highpass Hold (not <br/>
High Keep) come to mind. EQAtlas also shows Lesser Faydark (I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t), Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron (also very tough, but on the way to <br/>
Unrest), and East Karana as appropriate for your level.  Plus many <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Kharlisht, lately more Leofric than anything<br/>
