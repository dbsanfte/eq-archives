<div id="ygrps-yiv-497565801">At lvl 6, Orc Hill and the surrounding area will<br/>
still give you good xp. Try the orcs that spawn near<br/>
the CB ent--they are a little higher level and the<br/>
nearby zone makes hunting safer. Also, while Legos may<br/>
be too tough for your level, there are other mobs in<br/>
CB that are good. Try heading over to the Slave<br/>
Tents (not the slaver pit by the castle). There are<br/>
fewer Legos there, and there are a wide range of Cents<br/>
and Slavers too choose from. You can get keys from<br/>
the slavers and set the slaves free for additional<br/>
XP. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond that-- you can head out to<br/>
Steamfont and team up with gnomes there-- though most of<br/>
the stuff you&#39;ll fight is wandering instead of at a<br/>
static camp (although there are 2 Kobold camps that you<br/>
should be able to take with a group). BB has lots of<br/>
different camps, though I didn&#39;t hunt there until at least<br/>
lvl 10 (at the chessboard), and later (at the bandit<br/>
camp and orc shrine). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have fun-- CB is a fun<br/>
and fast area. Many lower levels &quot;grow up&quot; there--<br/>
starting at the entrance areas, then to slave camp, then<br/>
to slave pits, then to castle front, then to Throne<br/>
Room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>
