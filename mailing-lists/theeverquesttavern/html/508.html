<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719806359">Overcrowding is&#39;nt the word at times..lol..i use<br/>
to get kinda P Oed when I HAD TO SHARE hee hee...i<br/>
learned a few things..sometimes it&#39;s helpful to have a<br/>
crowd to pick off the extras that are trying to kill<br/>
ya, gives you someone to talk to, and if your<br/>
desperate to be alone there&#39;s alot of areas for that i&#39;ve<br/>
died at several. I&#39;ve noticed the server problems too<br/>
but when you look at the massive amount of<br/>
information being transfered it&#39;s mind boggeling.&lt;br&gt;there<br/>
are some loud mouthed whiners you run into but that<br/>
can make it interesting if your bored and in the mood<br/>
for tweaking someone..they are generally the ones who<br/>
want you to not kill anything till they&#39;ve killed and<br/>
looted all and you may wait till they are offline to<br/>
kill, needless to say those are the ones i watch run<br/>
when they bite off more then they can chew.&lt;br&gt;Hey<br/>
guys i&#39;m a level 14 now and can take on legos as long<br/>
as they don&#39;t bring friends...i screwed up making my<br/>
warrior and gave her int. thinking i could cast spells<br/>
later DUH.. so now i have a weak but smart<br/>
one..lol.&lt;br&gt; see ya in Lanys Beechwoodgrey</div>
