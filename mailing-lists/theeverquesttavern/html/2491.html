<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036795082">There are 2 schools of thought regarding where to<br/>
go in your Late teens early Twenties. Here&#39;s what i<br/>
did (this is for a Barb Shaman) 15-18 Oasis, at 18 I<br/>
went to Lake Rathe and started on Aviaks and then<br/>
moved up to Gnolls i went from 18 to 24 here Very<br/>
Quickly, after 24 SK (its just outside) and got a spire<br/>
group. You can easliy go from 24 - 30 at the spires.<br/>
LOIO is a great zone and you can go all the way to 30<br/>
there, but i think that until 24 Lake Rathe is the<br/>
best..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nyk..&lt;br&gt;Knowledge is Power. Power Corrupts. Study Hard. Be Evil.</div>
