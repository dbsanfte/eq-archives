<div id="ygrps-yiv-664588628">As far as kiting goes-- Druids are the masters.<br/>
Sow, snare, DOTs, root and you can bring almost<br/>
anything down (that doesn&#39;t resist). BUT-- don&#39;t forget<br/>
that we can also fear kite, though only on animals--<br/>
this is VERY profitable in Everfrost against Mammoths.<br/>
AND we can charm animals too, so we can have helpful<br/>
pets for our kiting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who else can quad kite, i<br/>
ask you?? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-- Gods are not<br/>
mere mortals!!! They are the GODS!!! It just so<br/>
happens that, through magiks and divine interventions,<br/>
some chosen members can become heroes and even<br/>
powerful godlings themsleves!!! (/ooc over level 50)</div>
