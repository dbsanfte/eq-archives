<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045624340">I&#39;ve been foraging alot of these recently in the<br/>
karanas. They look like lambent stones and are lore/no<br/>
drop. Seems to be a pretty new thing, as people were<br/>
/ooc ing about finding these things the other<br/>
day.&lt;br&gt;Anyone know what they are for? I&#39;ve been saving them all<br/>
just in case they&#39;r for some new quests on the<br/>
expansion perhaps.&lt;br&gt;Thanks : )&lt;br&gt;Iridia</div>
