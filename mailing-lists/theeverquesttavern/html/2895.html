<div id="ygrps-yiv-857241967">I have reached 6th lvl on my own so far.  Not playing much as I am usually<br/>
on the Saryrn server as Gwolfe or an alternate.  Just as the Ring of Shadows<br/>
guild if I am online, they usually know how to find me....heh heh<br/>

<br/>
  This in in response to the post asking of the mage playing time.<br/>
  Since there has been little in the way of response for the guild, I<br/>
  have been playing my chars on rodcet nife server.  Once there is a<br/>
  following intrest and more ppl are involved I may find more time to<br/>
  play the mage, however atm it is more benificial to me to play my<br/>
  char on my server with friends i already know and love.  Seven more<br/>
  responses and I&#39;ll have the time, but I do play between 11p-2a CST.<br/>
  If you need to contact me im probably on Rodcet Nife as &quot;Sebwin&quot; so<br/>
  if its set to get started let me know.<br/>
