<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754646879">Hey -- I think this line &quot;PS... Int probably<br/>
isn&#39;t the highest priority for a Rogue. =) 10 points is<br/>
probably excessive. Not if you&#39;re doing for RP values<br/>
though. Heh.&quot; was meant for me, since I mentioned that I<br/>
was contemplating putting ten points on intelligence.<br/>
I&#39;ve had second thoughts, now, and I think I&#39;m just<br/>
going to put an extra ten on Strength, and 20 on<br/>
Agility, so I&#39;ll have 100 in each, as well as in<br/>
Dexterity. It will jus be a challenge to roleplay a stupid<br/>
dwarf.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But from your previous comment, I&#39;m still unsure of<br/>
what an &quot;exp mob&quot; is. Expert? Experience? You also<br/>
mentioned that &quot;hybrid classes used to drain experience<br/>
from a group.&quot; What&#39;s a hybrid class? The shadow-night<br/>
and paladin types, who get combat ability as well as<br/>
magic? Haven&#39;t seen anything about multi-classed<br/>
characters, as in D&D. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, let me vent -- I<br/>
STILL DON&#39;T HAVE THE GAME. Argh. !@#*%^& UPS -- can&#39;t<br/>
get their head out to deliver the package to where I<br/>
work. It&#39;s bad -- I&#39;m jonesing for a game I&#39;ve never<br/>
played. Just hope it lives up to my expectations.</div>
