<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224623352">Hi there, I think most of the good higher druid<br/>
weapons are 1hnd blunt and 1hnd slash, so you might want<br/>
to get one of those types of weapons to get your<br/>
skill up. My druid did use a runed totem staff from<br/>
about level 5 to level 12 and I recomend that as well<br/>
if you can get your hands on one : ) Its two hnd<br/>
blunt but does a nice bit of damage and the mana boost<br/>
is nice.</div>
