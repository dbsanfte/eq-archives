<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413040711">Yep. Afraid that&#39;s al it does. Sense magic tells<br/>
you what a magic item is, which was completely<br/>
useless after the beta testing because all items tell you<br/>
what they are when you right click on them anyway.<br/>
Verant has been promising to replace it with a more<br/>
useful spell for months, so they changed it to a spell<br/>
designed to do what you can do with a compass or a good<br/>
direction sense skill. Never mind the fact that you can<br/>
tell what direction you&#39;re facing by the way the<br/>
clouds are blowing. (Or so i&#39;ve read. I&#39;ve never<br/>
bothered testing it.)</div>
