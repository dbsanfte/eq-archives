<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817630683">That&#39;s partially correct. Dual wield gives you<br/>
the opportunity to wield another weapon in your<br/>
off-hand. Now, as your skill in dual wield rises, so will<br/>
the number of swings your off-hand will get. Also<br/>
factored into this is the delay of the weapon in your<br/>
off-hand; generally, the lower, the better, without<br/>
sacrificing too much power. If you have a weapon with a high<br/>
delay in your off-hand, don&#39;t expect to see many swings<br/>
with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, your damage caps will be removed<br/>
at level 20, and will also rise as you level after<br/>
this. You&#39;ll get a damage bonus only in your primary<br/>
hand, so take this into thought as<br/>
well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar</div>
