<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430854914">Iksar SK is a nice choice. I have a Dark Elf SK<br/>
and he rocks. As an Iksar I think you only have one<br/>
chioce as far as a diety. The only drawback is that you<br/>
are hated everywhere so banking could be a problem if<br/>
you decide to leave your island but it is not<br/>
impossible with a lot of faction work. Iksars also have a<br/>
higher natural regeneration rate which will save you a<br/>
lot of downtime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I say choose a class that<br/>
fits your playing style and personality. If you think<br/>
you are going to solo a lot I would recommend Necro,<br/>
SK (if you want to melee), Druid or Mage. They seem<br/>
to me to be the easiest solo classes. As far as race<br/>
goes, it is really a matter of preference. Race might<br/>
make a difference initially, but at high levels its<br/>
almost a non-issue. Chances are if you are like most of<br/>
us, you will try many combinations of races/classes<br/>
before you commit to one or two. Be warned, most of the<br/>
people around here seem to be Druids so expect to hear a<br/>
lot about how great Druids are.</div>
