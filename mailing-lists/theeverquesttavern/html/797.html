<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295561220">Yuck, last night was terrible. A few friends and<br/>
I, all around 20, were fighting the yard trash in<br/>
Mistmoore, mostly enemies around 22-24 or so, nothing we<br/>
couldn&#39;t handle. Well there are some higher level people<br/>
fighting in the castle itself, and they call a train. So<br/>
my party zones and after a few minutes we return.<br/>
I&#39;m the last of three people in, and I get charmed by<br/>
some mob, forgot what it was. So I&#39;m basically this<br/>
thing&#39;s pet. Somehow I end up from the courtyard to the<br/>
maid room, which is a huge jump in the level of mobs,<br/>
around 20 or so. Still charmed, I see a friend of mine,<br/>
a 48 rogue, and 3 of his friends fighting 3 mobs.<br/>
Well I start attacking them but I&#39;m luckily not<br/>
hitting them much because I&#39;m such a low level. They get<br/>
down to about 2 mobs or so and, for some reason, I&#39;m<br/>
charmed to hit a pet in there. I conned it before I hit<br/>
it, it was yellow to me. Anyway, whomever was<br/>
controlling me made me hit the pet, and about 10 mobs flooded<br/>
the room. I killed everyone in there, including<br/>
myself. I felt like caca. But, luckily, those other<br/>
people in there forgave me relatively quickly and even<br/>
got my corpse to me. Here&#39;s a tip for anyone in<br/>
Mistmoore - leave the pets alone. Their masters will<br/>
annihilate you if you touch them. They&#39;re usually non aggro,<br/>
and I don&#39;t know why I was charmed into hitting it in<br/>
the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Half elf warrior<br/>
