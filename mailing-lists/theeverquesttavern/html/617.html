<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925014044">Ack, that sucks. I had a similiar experience in<br/>
Befallen once. 4 Deaths, lost a level, and lost most of my<br/>
Woven armor. One of the worse nights ever in<br/>
EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the bad nights make you appreciate the good<br/>
nights that much more. Hard lessons to learn, but ones<br/>
that should be learned early nonetheless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A<br/>
little on Befallen, the undead denizens of this dungeon<br/>
count as undead, but also as normal monsters. For<br/>
example both Invisibility to Undead AND regular<br/>
Invisibility will hide you from the undead in<br/>
Befallen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>
