<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713735762">okay here&#39;s another question. my roommate shares<br/>
the game with me. he has a level 14 barbarian.however<br/>
he&#39;s wanting to get his own computer(well,he already<br/>
has one it just needs fixed).i was wondering would he<br/>
have to start a new chaacter,or can you move his<br/>
character to a new account if you ask a gm or something.<br/>
probably not,but i was just wondering.</div>
