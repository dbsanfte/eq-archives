<div id="ygrps-yiv-203572848">My thought on Everquest is that it is a game.  A game that i enjoy playing because it is a source of entertainment.  I enjoyed reading the books by JRR Tolkien and this game is based very closely on his literature if you have not noticed which i am sure everyone has. <br/>
I have been playing for about 3 months now.  The game experience is awesome. You get to help others and there is a goal involved unlike television. In my opinion it is a great game, i hope others pick it up, i got my 14 year old sister to play it and now her and all her friends play together on it, they have a blast yet she has the sense to keep up with her homework and is still on the honor roll so there goes that theory of it making kids unable to conduct themselves in school.  In accordance to the addiction side to it; it only will be your life IF you let it.  There is NOTHING hypnotic about it by any means. You either choose to play or you don&#39;t. Those who play it 24-7 do so because they choose to and those who play it once a week also do so b/c they choose to do so.<br/>
Also i have a question about your thesis hon, how are you going to use this to help you? by quoting us? are you asking help from any other groups? do you play the game? My thought for you is that if you want the total experience of Everquest you should go out to the store and purchase it and try it out for yourself, that will add some pages to yoru paper and accordign to what server you choose i KNOW those of us who are on that server would be very happy to help you learn and get started!! It is a great game, i hope your paper goes well ! if you need more help just ask!<br/>

for his son playing this game in the first place.  In<br/>
the opening game sequence in agreeing to the contract,<br/>
a person must be of lawful age or have the consent of<br/>
a parent or legal guardian.  Unless of course, his<br/>
father didn&#39;t know, then his son was pursuing illegal<br/>
activities. <br/>
<br/>
And, about his solution.  Sending his son to boarding<br/>
school.... LMAO  don&#39;t take the kid away from video<br/>
games, take video games away from the kid.  I mean<br/>
SERIOUSLY.  Any child that would not abide by the<br/>
house rules isn&#39;t too well raised anyway.. he says he<br/>
heard his son playing in the middle of the night... he<br/>
shoulda picked his kid up by the collar and beat the<br/>
ever lovin %^*$ out of him.... I gaurantee, he would<br/>
reconsider breaking the rules if he knew there would<br/>
be consiquences... obviously this kid had more<br/>
problems thanm just video games...<br/>
<br/>
  Don&#39;t even get me started about the suicidal punk on<br/>
48 hours either......   I hate to sound cold and<br/>
lacking in compassion, but quite frankly she asked for<br/>
the view of the players, she undoubtedly SAW 48 hours<br/>
in the first place, and it was most likely what<br/>
provoked the choice of senior thesis.<br/>

&gt; &gt; In my experience, anyone who would be so afflicted<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; the outcome of a game is not a terribly stable<br/>
&gt; person<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the first place.  Everquest has actually helped<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; save money for tuition, and has kept me out of<br/>
&gt; trouble<br/>
&gt; &gt; as well.  I sit at home and play EverQuest for a<br/>
&gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours every night.  With a starting cost of 9.95<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game, 12.95 a month for a pre-paid card (I<br/>
&gt; hate<br/>
&gt; &gt; credit cards), I get the first month free, 19.99 a<br/>
&gt; &gt; month in internet services (which I would have<br/>
&gt; anyway)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everquest is a subliminal addiction, just like<br/>
&gt; certain people setting <br/>
&gt; all things aside for football... on a much lesser<br/>
&gt; scale of course <br/>
&gt; because quite frank, there is absolutely no<br/>
&gt; redeeming value of <br/>
&gt; dedicating one&#39;s entire time and achieving something<br/>
&gt; in a video game <br/>
&gt; besides personal satisfaction (unless it&#39;s some<br/>
&gt; godawful tournament <br/>
&gt; which I can&#39;t ****ing stand). It all depends on the<br/>
&gt; individual. <br/>
&gt; Certain people can set rigid guidelines for<br/>
&gt; themselves (play for a <br/>
&gt; certain number of hours) and abide by them, and some<br/>
&gt; people can&#39;t. <br/>
