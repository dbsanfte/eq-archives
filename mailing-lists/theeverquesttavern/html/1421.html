<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-195855346">Many thanks, Xela. On the blue cons, lemme think<br/>
. . . they were goblins (warriors or just plain<br/>
ones), and before I think they conned white. So maybe<br/>
I&#39;m even with them or something, now that I went up<br/>
to a level. Unfortunately, you pull one of those<br/>
things, you pull three, apparently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tongues<br/>
are for a quest item that only the small sneaky ones<br/>
with beards can use . . . you get the Mining Pick, but<br/>
there&#39;s a fourth tongue that I have to get by offing a<br/>
traitorous Dwarf in Crushbone. That should be an<br/>
adventure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One other thing that I just thought of -- do Orc<br/>
Oracles see through a Rogue&#39;s Hide/Sneak? I was poking<br/>
around the stone column in Butcherblock, surrounded by<br/>
two Cents and an Oracle, when all of a sudden they<br/>
spied me and stomped me. I may have hit some key the<br/>
betrayed me, but I don&#39;t think so. Let&#39;s hear it for<br/>
/corpse!</div>
