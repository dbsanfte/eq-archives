You can start your epci at any lvl you choose, I was 60 before I <br/>
obtained my epic, I felt levels were more important.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few powerful guilds on my server, one of them worked on a <br/>
epic for a shaman twink, this clown achieved shaman epic at lvl 12, <br/>
by short circuiting some of the harder fights.  Made me real sad as I <br/>
worked very hard for mine. Most of the epic is no problem, the major <br/>
bottle neck is the tear that drops in fear, this held me up for aprox <br/>
6 months. <br/>
<br/>
The best link I have found for shaman specific questions about <br/>
anything pretty much is:<br/>
<br/>
www.eqshaman.com<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have been at this stoopid game for close to 3 years. My crowning<br/>

&gt; &gt; flowers&#39;) is lvl 60 epiced shaman with complete spellbook<br/>
&gt; &gt; (no &#39;Ancient Scrolls&#39; yet) and 25 AA pts. Even after playing EQ <br/>
