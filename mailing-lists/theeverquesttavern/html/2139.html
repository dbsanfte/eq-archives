<b>Subject:</b> Re: Different servers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134372689">From what I see on eq I dont think there are any<br/>
geographic areas. Most of the servers are based out of<br/>
verant in CA. The only server that I know that is not is<br/>
the new one that is based in the UK. So most servers<br/>
have alot of different people playing. I know on<br/>
bertox there is guilds that are just french. I also know<br/>
some people who play from the uk and norway. Hope this<br/>
helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien</div>
