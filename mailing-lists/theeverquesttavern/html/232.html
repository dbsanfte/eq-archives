<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-572967900">Just thought that I&#39;d let everybody know that I<br/>
have finally reached level 20! I did so last night<br/>
while hunting in Najena. Level 19 had quite a splendid<br/>
end with the slaying of BoneCracker, whom gave me the<br/>
last bit of experience to level! I have yet to receive<br/>
my last name, I should be able tonight, but I am<br/>
still quite a happy Elf =) I am now getting ready to<br/>
return to my beloved Kelethin to train in the precious<br/>
skill of Double Attack, do some damage in Crushbone,<br/>
and show off a bit! See you all in<br/>
