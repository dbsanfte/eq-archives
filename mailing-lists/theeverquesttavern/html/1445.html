<div id="ygrps-yiv-437509017">It is not possible to move a character from one<br/>
account to another. That means you&#39;ll have to start over.<br/>
Good news is that your friend can give you all the<br/>
stuff on your character. Sure some consider it<br/>
twinking, but you did earn it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only way to move<br/>
a char from one server to another is when the<br/>
server you are on splits. This just recently happened<br/>
with The Rathe. They had the /movelog open on two<br/>
different occassions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keiyuki</div>
