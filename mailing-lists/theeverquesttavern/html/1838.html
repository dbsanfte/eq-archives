<div id="ygrps-yiv-789219720">Totally untwinked. Like I&#39;ve said before, up<br/>
until about level 20, I basically had a full set of<br/>
leather armor and a few items that i&#39;d quested. (When i<br/>
found the Test. of Vanear quest, i realized that i<br/>
could start to increase my stats and not just do minor<br/>
quests and &quot;scout&quot; the lands, which I had been doing for<br/>
20 levels-- plus, druid quests are REALLY bad and<br/>
few and far between). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quested Testament, got<br/>
a prayer cloth of tunare from doing the first part<br/>
of the screaming mace quest, go a savant&#39;s cap in<br/>
unrest, got SP hid gloves in SK-- then saw how much more<br/>
mana I had. But it wasn&#39;t until the high 20s that I<br/>
started to get good stuff. Symbols of Tunare quests (took<br/>
forever!!) Hunting Mammys in EF got me tons of pp (for the<br/>
FIRST time), and i started grouping in Perma A LOT. Got<br/>
great XP and after a few weeks, got a cloak and<br/>
circlet. Ported over to Feerot and teamed in CT and Guk<br/>
till I got mantle and leggings (lost roll for<br/>
leggings, but bought them from winner at a great price).<br/>
Picked up some WIS rings and earrings along the way, and<br/>
after making money porting all over the world, I<br/>
finally hit Gfay-Mart with all the pp i&#39;d been collecting<br/>
and saving and made enough deals to get some great<br/>
gear and WIS up close to 180. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So-- first 20<br/>
levels were sent having fun, questing and exploring.<br/>
Started to pay attention to quests for WIS items, and<br/>
then from about 26-30 worked on collecting pp and<br/>
getting all the wis things i could. Bought up by lvl 32,<br/>
and headed out to Velius, ready to play with the big<br/>
boys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My point is, non-twinked druids have it<br/>
rough as far as GREAT items early on, but your time<br/>
will come. Most of the stuff I have I got from drops<br/>
and quests. (BTW-- Forrest Giants in WW are the way<br/>
to get your Loops--much easier than FM giants,<br/>
though the Loops seemed to be a more rare drop in WW).<br/>
Once druids get ports, it becomes much easier to get<br/>
xp, pp and items. But don&#39;t forget to keep your<br/>
fighting techniques up!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My only regrets-- I love<br/>
to group, and need to perfect my kiting skills.<br/>
Also, my trade skills are pretty sad-- but i chose not<br/>
to spend a lot of time/money practicing them. Now i<br/>
see that it&#39;s a fun way to spend<br/>
down-time!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>
