<b>Subject:</b> Hurrieta&#39;s Robe?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-522536550">I did the quest in which you retrieve the wooden<br/>
tackle box that Trumpy threw into the water and gave it<br/>
back to the fisherman who lost it. After doing so he<br/>
gave me some copper and a robe. I&#39;m a druid so I can&#39;t<br/>
wear the robe, but it&#39;s a no drop item. Usually that<br/>
means a quest. Does anyone know who Hurrieta is and<br/>
where she is located?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lilaciana&lt;br&gt;Lvl 10<br/>
