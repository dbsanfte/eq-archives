<b>Subject:</b> need help getting eq to run... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018129483">ok, i installed eq, updated the patch, and when i<br/>
hit &quot;Play Online&quot; my computer doesn&#39;t run the exe<br/>
file...what do you think this could be, can someone here help<br/>
me out? i dont have an account yet (b/c i can&#39;t log<br/>
on for one) and so i can&#39;t get tech support. i have<br/>
a 366 processor (sufficient but not great) and the<br/>
tutorial seems to run fine. i have an aol connection (for<br/>
now, hey it&#39;s free), and it&#39;s a LAN connection (56k)<br/>
so what the heck is the problem...someone please<br/>
help me. should i de-re install?</div>
