<div id="ygrps-yiv-740830975">I think one thing you are forgetting about<br/>
Engulfing Darkness is that you can still use F7 and F8 to<br/>
target the necro and his pet. Even if he is blinded the<br/>
pally could target and bash the skelly to pieces and<br/>
then target teh necro and turn on auto attack (If<br/>
necro is hitting pally, and pally is not hitting necro<br/>
pally is facing wrong dirction) and start casting his<br/>
spells. I am not saying the pally would win, but if the<br/>
necro wasn&#39;t careful an experianced pally could do<br/>
major harm. Of course the necro has Shadow Step up his<br/>
sleve in case things get nasty... as long as he rembers<br/>
not to burn out all his mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pirotes&lt;br&gt;DE<br/>
