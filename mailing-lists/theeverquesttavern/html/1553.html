<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027696225">I agree with Shooman that this is a good board--<br/>
good topics and helpful discussions without all the<br/>
flaming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t mind helping others-- i figured<br/>
that would be my role when I signed on as a druid. But<br/>
there are so many rude newbies, that assume that they<br/>
are entitled to buffs, coin, items-- that it just<br/>
gets to me sometimes. If i&#39;m at the bank in Kelethin<br/>
trading and talking to friends, and I get spammed with<br/>
&quot;Sow me Please?&quot; ten times, I&#39;ll often cast harmony on<br/>
the newbie, and say &quot;chill out and come see me in 5<br/>
mins.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just wait till I hit lvl 24 and get<br/>
wolfform-- no going /anon then. I took a screenshot one day<br/>
on Orc Hill where a druid in wolf from was<br/>
surrounded by about 15 newbies, all saying &quot;Can I get SOW??&quot;<br/>
So much spam, I had to leave the area due to the<br/>
lag!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If someone comes up to me and asks for<br/>
help, i&#39;ll usually help. If someone does a /who all<br/>
search, and give me a tell from across a zone asking for<br/>
a SOW, I think that ruins the roleplay aspect,<br/>
which I love. Sometimes I&#39;ll respond with &quot;if you can<br/>
find me and ask nicely, I&#39;ll consider it,&quot; or even<br/>
&quot;What are these pestering voices in my head? Mother<br/>
Tunare, deliver me from this madness!!&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will<br/>
not only give buffs, but items to those who see me<br/>
and roleplay the request for SOW. &quot;Oh wise student of<br/>
Mother Tunare&#39;s gifts, might you show me the ways of the<br/>
wolf?&quot; When this newbie walked away from me, he not only<br/>
learned of the ways of Tunare, but was fast, rock hard,<br/>
and floating off the ground. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had a Troll<br/>
say &quot;Heh, U not so Fast, shory one. U gimme da wolfie<br/>
feets and I race you fast!&quot; We made a wager, we raced<br/>
(of course I won, but I let him keep his wager), and<br/>
I gave him some additional buffs for this fun<br/>
request. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These were people who found me while<br/>
/anon-- which I will often go just to get away from the<br/>
madness. But they will find you, and ask you anyway-- and<br/>
I am happy to oblige most times. It&#39;s that tell<br/>
from across the zone-- &quot;Can you come to the dock to<br/>
give me sow???&quot; that I&#39;m getting away from. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My<br/>
2sp worth (Hey, I&#39;m lvl 20 now, that&#39;s<br/>
inflation).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
