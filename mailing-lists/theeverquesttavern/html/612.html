<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595734952">The guild can be found underneath the arena in<br/>
Qeynos. You go down there and will see some warriors down<br/>
there... if you look carefull you will see bones on the<br/>
ground making a kind of path it will lead you to a<br/>
secret passage through a wall. The scret passage is in<br/>
the one of the &quot;cells&quot; bring a lightsource though<br/>
because it is verry dark down there. Then you&#39;ll zone<br/>
into the sewers system of Qeynos don&#39;t take the first<br/>
left but go straight on you will allready see some<br/>
Shadow Knight and Necro NPC here at the end on the right<br/>
is a gate where all the evil guilds are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be<br/>
carefull in Qeynos though, there are people in the town<br/>
that will kill you on sight. I was killed by a monk<br/>
NPC and by a Half Elf at the docks...</div>
