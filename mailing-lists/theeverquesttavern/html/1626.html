<div id="ygrps-yiv-234869312">Your fears are well founded, young<br/>
dwarf.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lesser Faydark was corrupted by the touch of<br/>
Cazic-Thule. The darkness fell across that woodland right<br/>
after his banishment of the Mother of All and the<br/>
corruption of Equestrielle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be warned: far more<br/>
dangers besides the sprites and brownies now reside in<br/>
LFay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A rogue of your seasons could be of great<br/>
assistance in defending Kelethin. Speak with others in the<br/>
area. Crushbone, it is said, will invade. And they&#39;ll<br/>
need every able-bodied fighter they can<br/>
find.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral Stormfang&lt;br&gt;Knight Commander&lt;br&gt;General of<br/>
Kelethin&lt;br&gt;Lanys T`Vyl</div>
