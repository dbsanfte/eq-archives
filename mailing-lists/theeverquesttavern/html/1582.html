<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691788106">usually, it is the polite thing to ask if he<br/>
wants help. If he doesn&#39;t say anything, and begins to<br/>
drop below 40% health with a majority of the train<br/>
still on board, swing away. It may save his life, and<br/>
it will save anyone who is nearby that may have died<br/>
when he did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and now... I have a<br/>
confession:&lt;br&gt;I killed a man.&lt;br&gt;I wasted a cleric.&lt;br&gt;Flat out<br/>
leveled him down to the ground.&lt;br&gt;I can&#39;t stand it, I<br/>
have to get it off my chest.&lt;br&gt;He was sitting too<br/>
near the gypsies in North Karana when the enchanter<br/>
one charmed me and went beserk. I had no idea, no<br/>
control. All I knew was my screen said, &quot;You have slain<br/>
So-and-So&quot; I thought OMG I killed a player... I soon snapped<br/>
out of my charm and wasted the gypsy, then cried over<br/>
the young cleric I had wasted. I tried to find him a<br/>
resurrection in the zone. I apologized profusely, and offered<br/>
him all the platinum I had on me in hopes he would<br/>
forgive me. If my memory was better, I would apologize<br/>
again now, but alas, my memory kinda bites. He took it<br/>
pretty well, and we laughed about it a little later. But<br/>
my hands have felt the blood of a player, and I am<br/>
scarred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Cleric Hunter of Spiritus<br/>
