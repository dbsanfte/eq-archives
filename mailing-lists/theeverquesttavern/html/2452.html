<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006164717">SNIP Remember when a Backpack in every slot in<br/>
the bank seemed impossible? Now I&#39;m pondering<br/>
spending all my plat on tailored backpacks for every slot<br/>
that has a backpack on my Druid. LOL SNIP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do<br/>
NOT do that! There is an alternative! You used to be<br/>
able to get 10 slot sewing kits from Spoolie Gee in N<br/>
Ro but they made them no longer available to force<br/>
folks to use looms.&lt;br&gt; You can go to Velious and<br/>
purchase 10 slot tool boxes (hold giant (size) for less<br/>
than 2pp each. They are on a gnome near the dock. He&#39;s<br/>
in an igloo if I remember correctly.&lt;br&gt; You can<br/>
also go to Luclin (The Bazaar to be exact) and<br/>
purchase merchant bags (10 slot, 25weight (ouch) holds<br/>
giant) for less than 2 pp each also. And the merchant is<br/>
not more than a few feet from the bank that is<br/>
there!Now all 7 of my toons have 80 spaces in the bank! The<br/>
only problem is finding enough keepable stuff to fill<br/>
them!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye Cousteau&lt;br&gt;31 Aquanaut of Karana</div>
