<div id="ygrps-yiv-301800319">Waaah i want green plate. This ivy armor stuff<br/>
makes me look like a Christmas elf! I have the ivy<br/>
tunic and sleeves, and I&#39;m going to greaves now.<br/>
Problem is that the NPC that has a compenent needed for<br/>
the quest has a spawn rate of 75 minutes WITH<br/>
placeholders!!! This is INSANE!! I&#39;ve camped that spot for 30+<br/>
hours and seen only 2 quivers, but i didn&#39;t get them.<br/>
Huh...and these quests were supposed to get rid of camping<br/>
