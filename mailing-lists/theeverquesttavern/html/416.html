<div id="ygrps-yiv-964566289">Just like in real life,&lt;br&gt;in EverQuest there are<br/>
jerks and there are some good people.&lt;br&gt;I find people<br/>
rather boring and don&#39;t socialize much (I&#39;m sure others<br/>
see me the same way).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in EverQuest I have<br/>
made some good friends, I just wish I could play as<br/>
much as them so I could level as often to continue<br/>
grouping with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t often join other groups<br/>
anymore, and rather personally invite the type of people I<br/>
want around me into my own Groups. Without good<br/>
grouping in EverQuest, I would have given up on it long<br/>
ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of you may say I should get a life, I think I<br/>
found one, or more, in EverQuest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knave (Rogue),<br/>
