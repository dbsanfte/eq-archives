<b>Subject:</b> Re: Is it just me or has EQ gotten borin <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-314216332">I do love EQ still, I think. I&#39;ve been playing<br/>
for two years--or at least I had. I&#39;ve lately had<br/>
some absolutely TERRIBLE experiences with groups, and<br/>
have gone from almost 36 to almost losing 35. It got<br/>
so bad that I&#39;ve only logged on once in the past two<br/>
months. I do kinda miss it, but I just haven&#39;t had the<br/>
time lately, and then only in small installments<br/>
(because of school and whatnot) I&#39;ve been playing AO<br/>
instead, since one mission takes about half an hour<br/>
sometimes, whereas I need more time to group on EQ.&lt;br&gt;Most<br/>
of my friends from two years ago have quit, and my<br/>
only friends left are my guildmates. But as I haven&#39;t<br/>
been on lately, my only contact with EQ has been the<br/>
message boards. (I didn&#39;t even log for the wedding of two<br/>
of my guildies. I feel horrible about that.) I do<br/>
miss it. But I have found that I love AO as well. I<br/>
think if I had time I&#39;d play again, because I miss<br/>
having fun (and I want 36, dammit!) I don&#39;t think bad<br/>
groups are the norm--I hope. More and more, I feel like<br/>
EQ has become worse and worse--because of the<br/>
people. There are still lots of great people there, but I<br/>
seem to encounter more and more idiots lately: ie, the<br/>
group leader in OT, who, after we both died, sat<br/>
outside the zone for half an hour, bitching that he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t come back until he got a rez. I didn&#39;t even think<br/>
to ask for one, and I didn&#39;t mind. I expected to<br/>
make up my exp loss, but I never did, because he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t start hunting. Needless to say, that was my<br/>
latest bad experience. I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m encountering<br/>
more idiots anymore. In my first few months of play, I<br/>
met so many great people--my late friends. I have yet<br/>
to meet another great person online withing the past<br/>
six months. It&#39;s quite disappointing.&lt;br&gt;Enough<br/>
rambling. Suffice it to say that I feel EQ has been<br/>
degraded and overrun with incompetent fools. I really do<br/>
want to come back, though.&lt;br&gt;I wish you all more<br/>
fortune that I&#39;ve had lately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Kanissa Noryk of<br/>
