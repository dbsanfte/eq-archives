<div id="ygrps-yiv-962911006">no! I was on vacation and the dumb flight was<br/>
cancelled and I would have been there for the party but I<br/>
wasn&#39;t and now I hear Gilerrin is leaving?! I sure hope<br/>
that he figures something out! Well, if not, I want to<br/>
help him with all he has done for this site and all<br/>
that he has helped me with in Norrath. It was always<br/>
nice to have a friend of identical class/race and at a<br/>
higher level to give pointers and good deals to a fellow<br/>
Ranger and many others as well =) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAY IT AIN&#39;T<br/>
SO!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trellan Hawksight, Wood Elf Ranger of 20 seasons.</div>
