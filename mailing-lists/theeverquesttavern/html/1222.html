<div id="ygrps-yiv-959729914">In addition to this there is Eq client Colors<br/>
editor on the EQ stratics network.<br/>
Specifically:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/info/custom_colors.shtml">http://eq.stratics.com/content/info/custom_colors.shtml</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/info/custom_colors.shtml&lt;/a">http://eq.stratics.com/content/info/custom_colors.shtml&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s a decent one and you don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
cutting and pasting in the right place. Plus it lets you<br/>
look to see a little of what it might look like before<br/>
going into the game (from what I can<br/>
remember).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or if you&#39;re the type that likes to do things<br/>
manually... I go into the EQsupp that patched recently. Then<br/>
I look to see what the text color I want to update<br/>
is called. (They&#39;re all numbered). Then I pull up<br/>
Powerpoint or some other RGB enabled program. Then I adjust<br/>
the RGB numbers in that program till it&#39;s the color I<br/>
like. Then I plug those numbers into the RGB 3 code for<br/>
that channel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s a lot easier than I&#39;m<br/>
explaining it. But again, it&#39;s up to your preferences. Other<br/>
than a few settings changes the EQ color editor works<br/>
great. I&#39;ve never tried the Caster site... but sure that<br/>
works as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS That EQ<br/>
supp explains pretty well how to edit your<br/>
EQclient.ini. I&#39;ve tweaked these last two weeks my colors as<br/>
well as logging in with run turned on, etc.</div>
