<b>Subject:</b> A dilema <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772335488">Ok,  I am trying to decide which character to get<br/>
settled into.  I have a lvl 8 Monk with 209 NATURAL AC<br/>
and a h2h attack of 152.  I also have a Mage I am<br/>
working on it is also lvl 8.  With the mage, I can<br/>
help people in the future, by supplying newbies with<br/>
phantom plate armor, but with the monk, I have<br/>
carefully raised him with very high skill points, and<br/>
am able to take on lvl 10-12 equiv mobs.  The thought<br/>
of taking on dragons is very appealing.  <br/>
  Any help in deciding which one to go further with<br/>
would be much appreciated.  Catch y&#39;all online,<br/>
Marshun AKA Dragonkahn AKA Ustachlak ect... ect... ect..<br/>
