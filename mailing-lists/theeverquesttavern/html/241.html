<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-59474050">I agree as well. The quest that orders Rangers to<br/>
hunt down the pixieshas been formed because the pixies<br/>
are becoming dangerously mishievious and that they<br/>
have been trying to set Kelethin on fire. Since<br/>
Kelethin is the refuge and lifeblood of Wood Elves, I<br/>
believe it can be assumed that all Wood Elves dislike<br/>
Pixies and that their destruction would be<br/>
approved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trellan Hawksight, Wood Elf Ranger of 20 seasons</div>
