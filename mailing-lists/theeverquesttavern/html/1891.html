<div id="ygrps-yiv-612188715">I&#39;m so sorry to hear that, hun.. Just curious,<br/>
what server are you on? &lt;br&gt;I have had some encounters<br/>
with rude people like that too, but I refuse to let<br/>
anyone ruin my playing time. I&#39;m not going to blabber<br/>
on, I&#39;m tired, it would be ugly.Just remember the<br/>
world is round for a reason.. the guy will get whats<br/>
coming to him eventually.</div>
