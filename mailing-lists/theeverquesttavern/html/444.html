<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239882131">You probably won&#39;t be making much money for a<br/>
while, being only level 4. When you&#39;re a coule of levels<br/>
higher you can take on gnolls and trade their fangs for<br/>
moonstones, and then trade the moonstones for blackburrow<br/>
stout. You can get pretty good money and exp from doing<br/>
that. Check out the quests on everlore for the full<br/>
details, names etc. Around level 8 its a good idea to hop<br/>
on the boat and go to kerra isle. Everything gives<br/>
good exp and you can get some nice loot like giant<br/>
snake fangs and lightstones, you&#39;d need a magic weapon<br/>
to hit the wisps however. Theres a really nice quest<br/>
where you save up your greater lightstones and trade<br/>
them to a gypsy in Norht karana for a tome which you<br/>
can sell for about 8pp. Hope this helps you out a bit</div>
