<div id="ygrps-yiv-201501233">Sniffle...&lt;br&gt;::wipes away tears from the<br/>
scarring::&lt;br&gt;I have always had respect for clerics, just as I<br/>
have always had respect for all the classes. In the<br/>
case that you feel used, ask yourself these questions:<br/>
Am I in a group that communicates to me (i.e.<br/>
listening when I say I&#39;m OOM)? Do I get a fair split of the<br/>
loot? Am I doing my job, without having to worry about<br/>
my own personal safety?&lt;br&gt;These questions work for<br/>
all the classes. From monk to warrior to druid to<br/>
wizard, it depends on playing fair and communication. If<br/>
a group communicates well, you should have no<br/>
problem with being &quot;used&quot;. As for those who run up to you<br/>
for a heal (or SoW, or clarity, or whatever the<br/>
trouble might be), tell them to wait on you, and you&#39;ll<br/>
see what you can do. You may still be &quot;used&quot; but at<br/>
least you&#39;re not readily available.&lt;br&gt;My thoughts on<br/>
clerics:&lt;br&gt;Wonderful wonderful people.&lt;br&gt;Nothing like an experience<br/>
resurrection in a hell level, ever had that feeling?&lt;br&gt;Heal<br/>
and buff. That&#39;s what you do, and you do it well, so<br/>
stick to it!&lt;br&gt;And I really do sympathize with<br/>
clerics. As a druid, I have to. Just as I sympathize with<br/>
mages, wizards, shaman, and necromancers (to a limited<br/>
extent). Since I share some of the abilities and,<br/>
therefore, responsibilities of these classes, I share in<br/>
their plights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Rabid Cleric<br/>
