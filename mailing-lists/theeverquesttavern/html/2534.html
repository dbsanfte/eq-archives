<div id="ygrps-yiv-214921684">Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t played since the<br/>
expansion due to video problems with my Savage S3 video<br/>
card. Sony says they are working the problem and will<br/>
keep me updated, but, since I haven&#39;t heard from them<br/>
in 2 months I think my current video card is a lost<br/>
cause. In any case when I fork over the money for a new<br/>
video card you can find me on Xegony Server with the<br/>
following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Euradite Level 51 Wizard (Wizzkid)&lt;br&gt;Ishkar Level 35<br/>
Shamman (Reptilious)&lt;br&gt;Barbarian Level 18 Warrior<br/>
(Crimsonsword)&lt;br&gt;Gnome? Level 7 Chanter (Mindmold)&lt;br&gt;High Elf Level 6<br/>
Cleric (Eyeheal)&lt;br&gt;and last, and certainly<br/>
least....hehe&lt;br&gt;Elfish? Level 1 Ranger (Arrowmatic)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope to see<br/>
anyone around that is on Xegony.</div>
