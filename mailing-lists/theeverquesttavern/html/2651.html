<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912578752">Welcome to EQ. I hope your will is strong and you can resist <br/>
addiction. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; own pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other online players <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play occurs with whoever <br/>
&gt; is online at the time and am I not tied into a specific group/times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way EQ works is similar to any other on-line game (Counterstrike, <br/>
Unreal, Diablo). The difference is the world of EQ is always on-line. <br/>
That said, yes you will enter EQ with any other players that are on-<br/>
line at the time. At peak hours, there can be 2000+ players. The <br/>
world of EQ + 3 Expansion sets, is immense (larger than any known RPG <br/>
I am aware of).<br/>
<br/>
About how much time you put in to this game... it depends what you <br/>
want to get out of EQ. Do you want to play the game, or use it to <br/>
meet and interact with players? I&#39;ll tell you as you progress through <br/>
the game, it becomes HEAVILY level oriented. That means you MUST gain <br/>
levels to experience all EQ has to offer. Gaining experience is an <br/>
arduous process, especially early levels where it&#39;s sort of mundane, <br/>
and it does require dedication. You have to budget your time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join with? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you come off as a good guy, then it shouldn&#39;t be a problem. With <br/>
thousands of players on-line, there has to be a group. ;) The bigger <br/>
problem is really if there is any room to adventure in?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kharnak, etc) does it <br/>
&gt; matter which one I start with or are the later addons geared for <br/>
&gt; higher level characters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You must have original EQ to start and run the game. The expansion <br/>
packages add extra races for you to choose from and they are created <br/>
to function as low-level to high-level adventuring like the original <br/>
EQ. If you choose the default races, you can play original EQ and at <br/>
anytime you want buy and add on the expansions. If you want to play <br/>
the new races, you have to have both original and whatever expansion <br/>
needed for the new race.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the system requirements <br/>
&gt; but what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866, 128sdram, 32mb ddr <br/>
 </span></blockquote>nvidia <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; geforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or should I wait <br/>
&gt; till I upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two things to keep in mind with EQ... can your monitor handle the <br/>
massive frame-rate, and is your connection stable? With a 56K modem <br/>
you&#39;ll probably receive info from EQ servers slower so the whole EQ <br/>
game will look slower to you. In any case, EQ will run on your <br/>
computer.</div>
