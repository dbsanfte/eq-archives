<div id="ygrps-yiv-925660768">The problem with EverQUEST, is that there aren&#39;t<br/>
enough quests that can be done. Many quests are certain<br/>
race, class or faction only. Most classes have a few<br/>
newbie quests, maybe an intermediate quest, a highlevel<br/>
quest and an epic. Others have very few-- (where are<br/>
the wood-elf druid quests?? Start by collecting rust<br/>
weapons? ack-- do it once for fun, then that&#39;s it-- if you<br/>
wander to Felwithe you can get the Symbol of Tunare<br/>
quests from the cleric guild-- tough to complete, but<br/>
you get a cool, upgradable item for your adventures<br/>
into dangerous Lesser Faydark)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many quests that<br/>
exist are too painstaking to complete-- ie Anyone got a<br/>
Jaggedpine Cloak (or whatever it&#39;s called)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are<br/>
some great quests for high xp and loot for around<br/>
level 10-- CB belts and pads not only give great xp,<br/>
but you get loot to equip or sell, AND you can keep<br/>
farming belts and pads to sell for plat. Same is true for<br/>
the DF belts in EC/WC -- quests in Freeport give you<br/>
great xp and gold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choosing wisely your hunting<br/>
areas and being good at auctioning are keys to getting<br/>
plat (also some tradeskills, but I wont go into that<br/>
here). I&#39;m not sure about Pallys, but I would assume<br/>
that there must be somewhere you can go to fight<br/>
undead that drop FS weapons (sell to merchants for about<br/>
5pp and to players for about 10pp). Maybe Unrest.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giant camps in Kunark (Forrest in WW and Mountain in<br/>
FM) are good places to group-- you have a shot at the<br/>
Forrest Loops and Foreman&#39;s geat, plus most stuff that<br/>
drops off these giants (ie legchopper) sell for GREAT<br/>
plat at merchants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you go through life just<br/>
fighting and selling stuff to merchants, though, you will<br/>
not get rich quick. Unfortunately, it takes putting<br/>
in the auction time to get serious pp.</div>
