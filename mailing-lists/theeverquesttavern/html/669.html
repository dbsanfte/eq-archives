<div id="ygrps-yiv-670014476">I would be more than happy to help you by<br/>
providing helpful advice, insight, and referrences to links<br/>
via this message board. I do not know how much actual<br/>
physical help I could give you. Maybe a few plat or<br/>
something to get rolling. That&#39;s only if you play on my<br/>
server though (Brell).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for your comment on<br/>
people killing you, nobody can actually attack you<br/>
unless you play on one of the PvP servers, Rallos,<br/>
Vallon, or Tallon Zek. If you do decide to play on Rallos<br/>
Zek, let me know because I have an old level 12 guy<br/>
there that I do not use any more. You could have all<br/>
his stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since you have never played EQ<br/>
before, I would NOT suggest starting on one of the PvP<br/>
servers. They can be somewhat frustrating for<br/>
beginners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall I think you will enjoy the game. I know I have<br/>
played it non-stop for the last year :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever<br/>
your decisions may be, best of luck and good<br/>
hunting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>
