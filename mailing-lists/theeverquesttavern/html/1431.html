<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068449460">Yep. I&#39;ve made it to the Warrens numerous times.<br/>
I made certain to have camo on though. The one time<br/>
I didn&#39;t, WHAM! Two out of four piercing attacks by<br/>
the skeleton guard for 137 each. A friend of mine<br/>
kept getting whacked even with camo. It turns out she<br/>
was following the wall instead of charging straight<br/>
out. My druid hunted the Warrens from 15 - 19. Took me<br/>
a while to get Ye Auld Ball Peen<br/>
Hammer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keiyuki</div>
