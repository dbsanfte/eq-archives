<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121476999">Paladin would win. You&#39;d have to assume they have<br/>
similar equipment for the contest to be fair. A Paladin<br/>
with the Fiery Avenger wouldn&#39;t really be a fair<br/>
contest. You also said to assume same race, which means<br/>
they&#39;d be Human. (only race that can be both)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The<br/>
spells each of them gets would play a minor role I<br/>
think, unless the SK got an Engulfing Darkness line to<br/>
stick, then he could kite. The pet would be an annoyance<br/>
to the paladin as well, causing more interruptions<br/>
for the paladin than the SK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I think it<br/>
really boils down to the HT vs LH. HT can be resisted<br/>
sometimes, LH cannot. Also, LH heals WAY WAY more damage<br/>
than HT can deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, toe-to-tpe, the Paladin<br/>
would win. If the SK could keep the paladin at a<br/>
distance using Darkness, then his spells and constant pet<br/>
annoyance might put him ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But my money&#39;s on the<br/>
paladin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>
