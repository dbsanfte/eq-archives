<div id="ygrps-yiv-394282517">Sounds like a moden problem. That would happen to<br/>
me on a dial up-- when you lag, you seem to be able<br/>
to move just fine (others see you running in<br/>
circles, swimming in mid air, or popping in and out of<br/>
existance though), but can&#39;t interact at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If<br/>
you are in Greater Faydark-- get out and see if that<br/>
helps. Lag there on most servers is the worst-- if you<br/>
go to Lesser Fay, BB, Felwithe or CB and it&#39;s<br/>
better-- you know it&#39;s a lag problem which might be<br/>
related to modem speed/connection too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than<br/>
that-- -i&#39;m not sure----but you gotta fix it, because<br/>
tonight is Halloween and EQ events will be all over the<br/>
place!!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
