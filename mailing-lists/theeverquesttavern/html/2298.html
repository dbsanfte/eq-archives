<div id="ygrps-yiv-963479286">FYI on the SoL guide-- this is what I was sent<br/>
from Amazon re: my pre-order of the<br/>
guide:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*********************************************&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Greetings from Amazon.com!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have contacted the<br/>
publisher by phone concerning the status of our &lt;br&gt;order<br/>
for &quot;Everquest: Shadows of Luclin: Prima&#39;s Official<br/>
Strategy &lt;br&gt;Guide.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The representative that we<br/>
spoke with indicated that this book has not &lt;br&gt;been<br/>
published and is expected to be released December 18, 2001.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;Release dates tend to fluctuate, however, so there is a<br/>
chance that &lt;br&gt;this will change. If we receive<br/>
additional information about this, we &lt;br&gt;will let you<br/>
know.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;************************************&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So just has for it for X-mas Shoom--- and make sure<br/>
it&#39;s on the list of someone who is a last minute<br/>
shopper, as it may not hit the stores until just before<br/>
x-mas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
