<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052023628">I&#39;ve been killing orcs to build faction but so far it hasn&#39;t had an <br/>
effect. How many do I have to kill before merchants will sell to me? <br/>
Also that city with the stone walls, do the guards attack me on sight <br/>
there? I&#39;m afraid of trying to find out.<br/>
<br/>
So far I love the character there. )</div>
