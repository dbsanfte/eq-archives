<div id="ygrps-yiv-769621194">I have a Bag of the Sewn Eye which is 70% weight<br/>
reduction. Which basically means if I put something in the<br/>
bag that weighs 10 lbs, it would only weigh 3 lbs in<br/>
the bag. Great for weeklings like me (Wizard.) There<br/>
are better bags, but with everything that is truly<br/>
good you pay a hefty price for them. If I remember<br/>
correctly I paid about 300pp for mine.</div>
