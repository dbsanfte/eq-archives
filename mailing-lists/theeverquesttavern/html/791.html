<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-385185509">First thing I check daily is Everlore just to<br/>
catch all the latest news and to keep up to date. Also<br/>
because the posts from Gordon and Brad are on there so i<br/>
don&#39;t have to read the damned Flameplayboard.. erm oop<br/>
sorry ment Gameplay :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I further use Everlore<br/>
becuase of a couple of good guides they have on Trade<br/>
skills and on Quest, Yes you are right they can be<br/>
frustrating and confusing with people asking the same<br/>
questions over and over. But sometimes it&#39;s a nice read<br/>
too. (Fire pot &quot;quest&quot;)&lt;br&gt;I also use it before I buy<br/>
my new spell to check wath they do and what the best<br/>
(player submited tacticts are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maximumeq, Yes I<br/>
also use it to check for prices and because they have<br/>
everything crossreferred.. Making looking for class or race<br/>
specific armor/weapons a breeze.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQvault, Mainly<br/>
for if I want to read player fiction stories, and<br/>
view player submited art (used to draw a lot myself).<br/>
It also is the first site i go to if I can&#39;t log<br/>
into Everquest as it has a serverstatus list dead<br/>
smack on the front page, so i can see if the servers a<br/>
re down or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh and I&#39;d like to come here<br/>
ofcourse and babbel a bit about nothing of grave<br/>
importance :P</div>
