<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676257755">1) Discovered just how many ppl don&#39;t know how to<br/>
group on Drinal. It&#39;s like mad monkeys. I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
tired of the number of times I&#39;ve gotten ignored. It&#39;s<br/>
not that I don&#39;t try to teach. It&#39;s that ppl don&#39;t<br/>
listen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I remember the first time I ever<br/>
grouped. I was SUCH a scrub. But I listened to the ppl<br/>
that had experience. I remember having trouble<br/>
figuring out what drawing was. LOL. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday, I<br/>
typed my fingers raw trying to explain the concept of<br/>
&quot;drawing&quot; and &quot;giving our casters time to med&quot;. My fingers<br/>
are actually sore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I actually dropped out of<br/>
a party earning mad exp b/c things were too pell<br/>
mell. Don&#39;t get me wrong. Badly organized groups can<br/>
make lotsa exp. Just too dangerous, and chaotic.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Am I being too picky here? I might be losing<br/>
perspective b/c of playing this game too long. Don&#39;t have fun<br/>
in an unorganized group. Dying is okay as long as it<br/>
isn&#39;t stupid death. There&#39;s enough adrenaline even when<br/>
in a good group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) That being said-- any<br/>
tips on looting in groups? How can a group keep from<br/>
being bogged by loot details and stay well oiled?<br/>
Lately, I&#39;ve had trouble not sitting down and trying to<br/>
order a group when I join. I feel bossy when I do that.<br/>
Hopefully other&#39;s don&#39;t think I&#39;m being harsh or bad.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think I&#39;m going to set down the policy that if<br/>
I&#39;m lead in a group-- I&#39;ll always add new members<br/>
till I&#39;m full. I&#39;ve found that works well-- and<br/>
usually someone knows the choice places to sit in a zone.<br/>

I&#39;m a long winded man/wood elf/ Iskar. =)I was also<br/>
in a strange mood to rant a bit. Thanks for bearing<br/>
with me.</div>
