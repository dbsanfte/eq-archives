<div id="ygrps-yiv-174263361">Hey Sarah!!! What do you mean by &quot;start<br/>
completely over&quot;?? Getting rid of your main for good and<br/>
starting with a new class/race? Here is my advice for<br/>
that-- which i&#39;ve taken recently-- try something<br/>
challenging, ESPECIALLY if you like the roleplay aspect. I<br/>
joined a young Xev server and chose a wood-elf druid-- i<br/>
love the wood-elfs and I love druids, but had i known<br/>
that there would be SO MANY of us on my server-- i may<br/>
have gone a different way. I never saw many mages--<br/>
nor too many gnomes, so my next char was a sassy and<br/>
egotistical female gnome mage. She&#39;s fun to play. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If<br/>
i have time someday soon-- i&#39;ll probably try a tank<br/>
class. Seen any female Barb rouges around? hmmm... DE<br/>
warriors look cool, but maybe the challenge is in a gnome<br/>
warrior. Or an Erudite Necro-- how does he get to<br/>
Antonicus without getting killed?????? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roleplay is<br/>
indeed fun-- it&#39;s pretty easy to RP a woodelf druid in<br/>
the service of Tunare, though. Sometimes I play as a<br/>
fanatical devout worshiper, but when i drink too much, I<br/>
play a &quot;fallen angel&quot; who doubts his faith, and turns<br/>
into a surly and lecherous drunk. Preacher or sinner,<br/>
my social hotkeys in battle are pretty fun.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The Godless %T IS SNARED, and will find no salvation<br/>
in its meaningless death!!&quot; (when i&#39;m righteous and<br/>
snaring)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;You may feel better %T, but question why you serve an<br/>
uncaring God&quot; (when i&#39;m surly and healing)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;FEAR ME<br/>
%T, and run from a so-called protector of nature!!&quot;<br/>
(surly and Terrorizing Animal)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Come to my aid<br/>
%T, and bask in the glory of serving the Great Mother<br/>
of All&quot; (when charming animals)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talk to you<br/>
all soon!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 32d<br/>
