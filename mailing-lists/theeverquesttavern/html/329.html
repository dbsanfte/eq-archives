<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919812793">After the new zone was added, I decided to check<br/>
it out. I thought it was a very interesting and<br/>
creative idea. If you weren&#39;t aware, this zone is not for<br/>
hunting. On the contrary, it is actually a zone entirely<br/>
devoted to quest distribution. This zone gives quests for<br/>
necromancers, magicians, wizards, enchanters, bards, and<br/>
clerics. The zone looks really great with all sorts of<br/>
lava spouts and rivers all over (Be careful! Fall in<br/>
the lava and you might find yourself trapped while<br/>
you are burned to death!) Unfortunately, all of the<br/>
quests are sort of high. For example, each of the quests<br/>
for clerics that will give you a piece of cleric only<br/>
armor, requires 2 or 3 enchanted platinum bars!<br/>
Unenchanted bars cost about 125pp EACH! Oh well, guess it&#39;s<br/>
time to do some leveling, hehe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those of you<br/>
not listed among those sponsered inthe Temple, do not<br/>
despair! Monks are warriors already have their quests<br/>
(Sashes/headbands and crafted) Rangers can obtain their new armor<br/>
quests at the ranger guild in Kithicor, Shadowknights<br/>
get theirs in Mistmoore, Rogues get theirs in Cazic<br/>
Thule, and druids in the rathe mountains. Still don&#39;t<br/>
know about shamen and paladins....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s my<br/>
little update. Go check out the new Temple. It is pretty<br/>
cool =)</div>
