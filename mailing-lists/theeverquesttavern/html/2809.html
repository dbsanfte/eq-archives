<div id="ygrps-yiv-735670960">=) Thanks for the kind consideration  <br/>
PsyKo Judges you amiable--Looks like a reasonably safe<br/>
opponent.<br/>
<br/>
Most people don&#39;t realise as I already have in my<br/>
little time played, that you gain skill points through<br/>
combat, and the less skill points you have the less<br/>
powerful you are.  The red-con-killing twinks aren&#39;t<br/>
nearly as powerful as their homegrown cousins (us). <br/>
Which, is why I play my monk with no armor or weapons.<br/>
 Things are harder to kill, so I get more skill ups do<br/>
to extended combat.  <br/>
<br/>
I also like the thought of having a monk that uses no<br/>
armor or weapons because, when I die I don&#39;t have to<br/>
bother looting my corpse, which is a mojor problem for<br/>
a lot of low lvl chars.<br/>
<br/>
In ending, I would be interested in hearing some of<br/>
the knowledge of other monks on this message board.<br/>
<br/>
Go with peace,  Psyko<br/>

&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; about helping newbies with your mage, but they will<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; just fine without the extra help. I have a 43rd<br/>

&gt; Human Ranger (Grof Silversky) that I built from the<br/>
&gt; beginning with no t&#39;wicks, I hope someday to get<br/>
&gt; powerful enough to go after dragons, time will tell.<br/>
&gt; Good luck on your journey.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok,  I am trying to decide which character to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; settled into.  I have a lvl 8 Monk with 209<br/>
&gt; NATURAL<br/>
&gt; &gt; AC<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a h2h attack of 152.  I also have a Mage I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; working on it is also lvl 8.  With the mage, I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; help people in the future, by supplying newbies<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; phantom plate armor, but with the monk, I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; carefully raised him with very high skill points,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; am able to take on lvl 10-12 equiv mobs.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; of taking on dragons is very appealing.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Any help in deciding which one to go further<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be much appreciated.  Catch y&#39;all online,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Marshun AKA Dragonkahn AKA Ustachlak ect... ect...<br/>
&gt; &gt; ect..<br/>
