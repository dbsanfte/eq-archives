<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474749986">As a caster who has both played an enchanter and<br/>
a cleric, sometimes you die. &#92;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s a fact<br/>
of life. Even i have rants on here about tanks not<br/>
helping there healers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The big thing i never got<br/>
teasty with my words. Keep it clean for the children out<br/>
there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But i can see where your coming from.<br/>
That just happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fefe out</div>
