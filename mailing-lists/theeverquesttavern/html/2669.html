<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098333967">Well it&#39;s been a few and I thought I would post a quick line or two. <br/>
Wanna guess what I have to say? Yup you guessed it. I was approved <br/>
for a loan for school so now I can afford to either upgrade or buy a <br/>
whole new computer! Upgradeing would be cheaper, but buying a whole <br/>
new system would be easier. Plus I&#39;ll be able to get all the new toys <br/>
like a DVD player and larger hard drive. What do ya&#39;ll think? The <br/>
Raven    P.S. Oh yeah I have to wait till either the end of this <br/>
month or the middle of next month. *sigh* giving with one hand.....</div>
