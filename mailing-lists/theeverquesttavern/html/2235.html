<div id="ygrps-yiv-33042435">Welcome to the Game!! The best advice I can give<br/>
you is to go to the mall or department store (i went<br/>
to BestBuy) and purchase Primas guide to EQ Ruins of<br/>
Kunark. It will cost around $17 or so but is well worth<br/>
the money. I have been playing for over a year now<br/>
but still regularly refer to the guide for info. Also<br/>
it has a list of web sites you can use for more<br/>
indepth info such as quests. Good luck and Good hunting<br/>
