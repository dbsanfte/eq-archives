<div id="ygrps-yiv-354871090">Alright. His choice of wording wasn&#39;t<br/>
particularly grand. But please, this world is full of people<br/>
that hate and then people that hate people that hate.<br/>
Hatred is hatred and your reaction isn&#39;t helping. It&#39;s<br/>
making it worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calling someone a bigot for a<br/>
prejudice is to not understand the nature of prejudice. I&#39;m<br/>
not saying he&#39;s right, or your wrong. I&#39;m saying that<br/>
the labels are far too convenient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If someone<br/>
wants an alternative life style club, then they go<br/>
ahead and join that club instead of his<br/>
club.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prejudice doesn&#39;t mean evil. It means a bias towards<br/>
something (non-dictionary-- off the top of my<br/>
head).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This club is prejudice. We exclude people that have<br/>
nothing to do with Everquest and they are not supposed to<br/>
post to this list. If everyone started talking UO or<br/>
Anarchy Online, I might just stop checking the lists.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And before anyone argues that that isn&#39;t prejudice--<br/>
by legal symantics that is prejudice. As far as I<br/>
know that is. I was an apartment manager and a lawyer<br/>
told us in a training session that prejudice depends<br/>
on what you&#39;re prejudice against. The law classifies<br/>
our eviction of non-paying tenants as prejudice<br/>
against people that cannot pay rent. The law is on our<br/>
side there. But we cannot say, show prejudice against<br/>
non-firemen and give firemen preferencial treatment just<br/>
because we think that will make our building safer. That<br/>
is illegal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I probably should have waited for<br/>
the 24 hour rule. No responds to posts before then.<br/>
But I thought, eh... I&#39;m not really angry. I am<br/>
fustrated and afraid. But only because I see fear breeding<br/>
fear and anger breeding anger... and fustration<br/>
overwashing, tinting, tainting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m no knight, no<br/>
philosopher. I am shooman. I am Fatedhue Prismatic. Thanks for<br/>
reading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out... I am nothing-- for lack of something.</div>
