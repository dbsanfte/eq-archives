<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082989212">Lots of people have good things to say about the<br/>
new PVP team server-- though i&#39;m not sure how much<br/>
roleplaying there is. There are some servers that are more<br/>
Roleplay than others. I&#39;m on Xev-- there are TONS of<br/>
/shouts and stuff that are not roleplayed (ie. people<br/>
don&#39;t use /ooc as much as they should). We have a<br/>
pretty good server, i think-- after i got over my<br/>
&quot;experimenting&quot; with other servers, i chose to develop all my<br/>
chars. here. LOTS of large guilds oriented to helping<br/>
others-- Mystic Healers, Povar-Tarew Artisans, etc. and<br/>
us-- The Defenders of Mithril Hall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good and<br/>
Bad on all servers-- our guild only has a few<br/>
&quot;darkies&quot; in it, but we (like our namesakes) recognize that<br/>
those who were born evil can follow the path of light.<br/>
Lots of interaction between light and dark races on<br/>
Xev, generally though. Although my DE chanter alt<br/>
secretly changes form and infiltrates the goodly cities<br/>
all the time-- stealing gossip and information to use<br/>
in the growing tension-- especially between freeport<br/>
and Neriak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doncha just love this<br/>
game????&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
