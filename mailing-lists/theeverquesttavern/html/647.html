<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-910986079">Does anyone have any info on the viability of<br/>
bard hand-to-hand fighting. I know he isn&#39;t even close<br/>
to monk but I wonder if he can actually still hit<br/>
things in later levels. I would like to play my<br/>
instriments and do some noticable damage, but I cant tell<br/>
what it would be like at 20+. Also has anyone tryed<br/>
kiteing with throwing weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Questing for<br/>
knowledge&lt;br&gt; Bard 7th song</div>
