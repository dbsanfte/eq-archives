<b>Subject:</b> Re: TWINKING-- a discussion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930094731">My opinion on twinking is varied. On one hand I<br/>
agree with it. I have recieved and passed on many<br/>
items. But the key was that they were not too far out of<br/>
my reach. One of my chars was asked if he was a good<br/>
person, I said I think so. I was then given a minotaur<br/>
ribcage and a two handed lamentation blade. Way out of<br/>
the reach of a character who is only 5 minutes old. A<br/>
fine steel blade, more acceptable to me. The funniest<br/>
sight I have seen was a full lambent covered bard<br/>
running for his life from deathfist pawns. Turns out he<br/>
was level one. That&#39;s ridiculous. Makes me root for<br/>
the monsters so his corpse would decay before he<br/>
recovered his stuff. Now the level 50 two account person<br/>
twinking his low level by ksing and camp stealing, death<br/>
to him. If it&#39;s reasonable, I don&#39;t have a problem<br/>
with it. I&#39;ve given away many a &#39;low&#39; thing to new<br/>
folks. But what really irks me are the ones who come up<br/>
and demand stuff. You&#39;ve encountered them. No hail,<br/>
no nothing. Just a tell &#39;Gimme some plat&#39;.<br/>
Repeatedly. Along with gimme some equipment. I died and don&#39;t<br/>
have anything. If so, wht are you in full ringmail and<br/>
carrying a sword while talking to me?! IDIOTS!!!<br/>
ARRRGGGHHHH. And we don&#39;t find your &#39;hey baby you&#39;re cute&#39; and<br/>
worse messages arousing nor funny. It ruins the game<br/>
for some of us. Maybe the guys playing girls like it<br/>
but not I. It made me go and start a male character<br/>
to get away from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I seem to have gotten<br/>
off topic. Sorry. In summary: reasonable twink-ok,<br/>
unreasonable-bad&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keiyuki</div>
