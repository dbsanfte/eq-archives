<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901784770">I completely AGREE! If someone gave me (or I<br/>
bought) a 50th level cleric for example I wouldn&#39;t know<br/>
how to play it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a lot of things that<br/>
a person learns as they build up a character. My<br/>
main is a 30th ranger but if someone gave me a 50th<br/>
ranger I&#39;d still be in the same boat, I wouldn&#39;t know<br/>
how to properly play it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a lot of<br/>
player education that goes on in building at character<br/>
up. Twinking armor or weapons to a character that you<br/>
yourself built isn&#39;t as bad because you at least know that<br/>
character and using a weapon doesn&#39;t really take a lot<br/>
beyond target and auto attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just remember<br/>
everyone it is called EverQUEST. That means you quest for<br/>
things and thats all part of the fun. Twinking a few<br/>
things now and again is ok in my book but just don&#39;t<br/>
lose sight of the goal! That goal is NOT to get to<br/>
level 60 as fast as you can. Its the journey there<br/>
thats the fun part. Its the friends that you make along<br/>
the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also keep in mind that all those<br/>
things that are sold on either message boards, auctions,<br/>
or in EQ are attainable by nothing more than<br/>
QUESTing for them and it doesn&#39;t cost you anything but<br/>
your time and thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dinbien&lt;br&gt;30th<br/>
