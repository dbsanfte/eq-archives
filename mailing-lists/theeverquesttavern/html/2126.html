<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118556863">Thanks for the advice. I&#39;m now using a dagger of<br/>
dropping that i bought from a Barb rogue (I could speak to<br/>
him in Thieves Cant, or i would have missed this<br/>
great deal). With that, I could hunt wisps, and then<br/>
snuck my way to NK to turn in GLS at the gypsie camp--<br/>
ended up netting me about 50pp!!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So now I&#39;m<br/>
lvl 14 with dual wield maxxed out, but still working<br/>
on max for Backstab. Oh, btw-- pickpocket is maxxed<br/>
out too-- /grin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I brought a regular axe,<br/>
which is pretty decent-- 1HS 6/31. I&#39;d like the gnoll<br/>
hide just for the delay-- to keep up my 1HS, dual<br/>
wield, and double attack when i get it at 16. I also use<br/>
throwing knives-- I&#39;v had a couple of 17dmg crits, and<br/>
just think it&#39;s great for rollplaying. &quot;Rumble eyes<br/>
you coldly as he picks his teeth with a razor sharp<br/>
knife.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as armor-- now that i have cash, i&#39;m looking<br/>
for some banded. Bought a gorget for 4pp (5ac, so I<br/>
thought that was a good deal). The rest is leather and<br/>
patchwork, as it&#39;s tough to find stuff at my level on this<br/>
new server. What i did do though is get that Freeport<br/>
Militia Tunic-- 9AC +3Dex-- which is pretty nice. It&#39;s<br/>
red and i get inspected a lot-- plus I&#39;m amiable with<br/>
the militia, who seem follow my life tenents.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That BP from Kaladim sounds good, but I don&#39;t much<br/>
like dwarves, and stay as far away from gnomes as<br/>
possible-- they give us short races a bad name, plus what&#39;s<br/>
the deal with thier lack of hair???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dragoon<br/>
Dirk is next on my list. I hear that D&#39;Vinn&#39;s evil<br/>
cousin D&#39;ornn (or something like that) hangs out at a<br/>
dervish camp in NRo and carries a Dirk as well. I don&#39;t<br/>
like sand much, but i&#39;m planning on making a trip<br/>
there soon anyway to see if a can trick some large<br/>
burly types into helping me get it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The life of<br/>
a rogue is the way for me. EQ is all new now!!<br/>
