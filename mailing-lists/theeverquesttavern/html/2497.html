<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656746128">With my experience, the only thing you need to<br/>
consider with a video card is the MB. I have a 32MB video<br/>
card (whatever kind Dell puts in) and I still have<br/>
SOME problems with it on occassions. The laptop I just<br/>
ordered has a 64MB card in it, so should be fine. I guess<br/>
the performance just depends on the options you<br/>
select, such as what races you have active and such. Hope<br/>
this helps somewhat.</div>
