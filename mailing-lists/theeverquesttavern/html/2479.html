<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677530202">One caviat to this message--- Some Drachnids can<br/>
Root you, AND some can cast a poison DOT (others have<br/>
to hit you to effect the poison DOT). If you are low<br/>
level and either of these things happen, you&#39;re in big<br/>
trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said-- I&#39;m in your same position-- as a<br/>
druid who has made those runs many times. If you can<br/>
Lev-- i suggest you do it in DL-- i can get past<br/>
Karnors in the air, such that nothing even has a chance<br/>
of agroing. Cake-- then you just have to dodge<br/>
Drachnids while going through the hills and trees finding<br/>
the cave enterence that leads to FV. Again---<br/>
remember that once in FV, you have to bypass drachnids to<br/>
get to the FV outpost or LOIO. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OH-- and there<br/>
seems to be a lvl 50+ quest mob Necro who rarely roams<br/>
around the run from FV outpost to LOIO and can see<br/>
invis-- didn&#39;t know about him until he killed my rogue<br/>
who was doing the run and was in the WRONG place at<br/>
the WRONG time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>
