<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539424415">Interesting story. Once our guild made an<br/>
ill-fortuned raid into Najena. We went to the jail and started<br/>
fighting when the pasty mage there charmed me and next<br/>
thing I knew I was attacking my whole guild, killed<br/>
them all! Then I just stood there until charm wore off<br/>
and ran quickly around the corner and hid. It worked<br/>
and I didn&#39;t die but my guild wasn&#39;t too pleased with<br/>
me! Oh well, you win a few and lose a<br/>
few!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uinan D&#39;Mortuus &lt;Blood of Mortuus&gt;&lt;br&gt;23rd season<br/>
