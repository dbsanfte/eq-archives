&gt; Has anyone here done this quest?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve killed a bunch of Rabid Wolves and I haven&#39;t gotten a single <br/>
&gt; Rabid Wolf Hide.  I always get Diseased Wolf Pelts. When I try to <br/>
&gt; combine one of the pelts with the other stuff for the cap it says I <br/>
&gt; cannot combine them in an object of that type :( <br/>
&gt; Do Rabid Wolves actually drop Rabid Wolf Hides in Qeynos Hills? If <br/>
&gt; they do, do they do it on the Quellious server? </span></blockquote></div>
