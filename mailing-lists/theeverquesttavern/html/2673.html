<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167721862">Well guys. It&#39;s finally here. The day I get back into the game. I am <br/>
picking up my new computer on Wednesday and I am getting Roadrunner <br/>
on Friday. So if my luck holds I should be back in the game Friday <br/>
night. Probably late Friday night as I will have to load the game and <br/>
download everything, but it will still be good to get into the game. <br/>
