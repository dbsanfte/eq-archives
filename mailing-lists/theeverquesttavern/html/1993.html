<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660551939">Get what ya want... but Xbox<br/>
outdated?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nah... it&#39;s a better machine than many PC&#39;s out there,<br/>
with better hardware, and video functions. In general<br/>
that is. And it&#39;s specifically all devoted for gaming.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen Xbox graphics for things like Soul Calibur<br/>
2, and a few other RPGs and been sorely tempted to<br/>
get one but no $$$ available unfortunately and I<br/>
don&#39;t spend what I don&#39;t have yet (unless it&#39;s an<br/>
emergency )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gamecube has one game that I look at to<br/>
make me wonder if Mario, and Metroid aren&#39;t going to<br/>
make a come back. That game is Rogue Squadron. Star<br/>
Wars is aways big but the nice user interface coupled<br/>
with the graphics and immensity of the game promises<br/>
well. If the other games are anything<br/>
close...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out (late for classes again... lol)</div>
