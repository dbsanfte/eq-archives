<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958856687">1) Roleplay vs Anonymous. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roleplay is to<br/>
allow you to roleplay and I believe with that command<br/>
you can tweak what items you want to show-- but I am<br/>
not sure on how to do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do know that<br/>
Anonymous will not even allow your guild to track you while<br/>
Roleplay does. It allows me to be shown on my guild&#39;s<br/>
whois and still not be found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was constantly<br/>
get harrassed for SoWs and gates. I put myself on<br/>
anonymous or role play and for a while-- unfortunately, ppl<br/>
knew I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;no&quot; usually to a quick sow-- or<br/>
if not in a group-- to gate. So I go roleplay. For<br/>
the most part-- it works out well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t<br/>
know how you avoid it. I get hit up pretty hard<br/>
usually for sows. Gates not as much so I don&#39;t mind as<br/>
much-- although I went to anony once I got gates b/c I<br/>
already couldn&#39;t stand all the buffs I had to<br/>
do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue of Drinal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... I love<br/>
emotes you can do when grouping. &quot;Calls down lightning<br/>
to strike his enemies&quot;. &quot;Teases all the girls into<br/>
hitting him black and blue&quot;... etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ can be a<br/>
lot of fun. I&#39;m so glad these boards in this club<br/>
aren&#39;t filled with all the hate and anger and<br/>
fustrations I see on other boards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shoomie out</div>
