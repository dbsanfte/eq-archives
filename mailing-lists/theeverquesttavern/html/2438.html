<div id="ygrps-yiv-41628037">&quot;Hmm no one walks up and gives me anything :(<br/>
&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hrmm... it can depends somewhat on servers. The older<br/>
servers have more people giving stuff away. I hate to say<br/>
it... but the High End game on Drinal is<br/>
ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I started November of 2000 and I still don&#39;t have a<br/>
high end character-- so I can&#39;t be 100%<br/>
sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I&#39;ve been told that about 40% of Drinal is 50+ or<br/>
has a character 50+. From what I can tell from the<br/>
consensus of people-- that&#39;s probably close to<br/>
truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So maybe that&#39;s why this server gives women more<br/>
items. LOL. Don&#39;t feel too bad. Course also you might be<br/>
playing a Troll, Iskar or Ogre female. It&#39;s kinda hard<br/>
sometimes to tell that they&#39;re female when people are<br/>
giving things away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>
Prismatic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... this is not to say that I know the mentality for<br/>
certain of those that give away items to women that ask<br/>
for them or just stand there looking lost.<br/>
=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I give away stuff to all just being myself. heh.<br/>
