<div id="ygrps-yiv-230483843">..Hehe, well, Teppie is a traveler.. In one<br/>
weekend, I went from Freeport, into Ro, Oasis, back to<br/>
Freeport, then Ocean of Tears, to Butcherblock, Kaladim,<br/>
Greater Fay, Felwithe, Lesser Fay, Kelethin, Ak&#39;Anon,<br/>
then back through to Butcherblock, to OOT, to<br/>
Freeport, through the commons, Nektulos Forest, Lavastorm,<br/>
to Karanas, to Qeynos Hills, and finally,<br/>
Qeynos..and then went on a mini-trip to Kerra Isle..but found<br/>
it quite dull and went back to Qeynos. Ah well,<br/>
though it&#39;s probably no big deal to most of you, this is<br/>
the most traveling Teppeny, I, have done. &lt;br&gt; Now, I<br/>
only used 1 teleport: from Lava to North Karanas.<br/>
Other than that, tis been by boat and RUNNING... and I<br/>
mean, RUNNING... (Ever see a Hobbit with SoW though?<br/>
Hee-hee...)&lt;br&gt; Anyway, now to the story: Well, after finally<br/>
reaching 17, that&#39;s when I went to Qeynos...and lost my<br/>
level. You see, me and my friend Xhiris (aka &#39;The Looney<br/>
Wizzie&#39;) were experimenting with that Eye of Zomm<br/>
spell..Actually, he made them, I hated them and whacked at<br/>
one--AND KILLED IT! Well, we decided to play a little game<br/>
of baseball... Twas fun for a bit, and then I<br/>
decided to try a spell.. We were under the docks in South<br/>
Qeynos, when I hit the hotkey 6 by mistake. I meant to<br/>
hit 5. 5 was Ignite, 6 was an Area Effect spell.<br/>
Well... apparently we had been way to close to the<br/>
guards..next thing I know, WHAM! ...You have been slain by<br/>
Lieutenat (I can&#39;t spell) What&#39;s-his-name. Ooops.. YOU have<br/>
lost a level! ...Hehe, luckily my bind point was<br/>
nearby..&lt;br&gt; The moral of this sory: NEVER let a tipsy hobbit<br/>
play baseball&lt;br&gt; ~Teppeny&lt;br&gt; Halfling Druid of the<br/>
16th (grr..I WANT MY LEVEL!)&lt;br&gt; Souls of Peace&lt;br&gt;<br/>
