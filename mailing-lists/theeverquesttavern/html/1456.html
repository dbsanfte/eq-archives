<div id="ygrps-yiv-559852515">Oh.. no... my friend wasn&#39;t trying to dupe me. No<br/>
one tries to take a practical joke out to a 45 min<br/>
plus argument where I was telling him... look, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t care about the other stuff you&#39;re saying-- but<br/>
there&#39;s no level 65&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found myself for 45 mins<br/>
going... &quot;No... I don&#39;t just think that I&#39;m always right.<br/>
No... I&#39;m not saying no on the level 65 b/c I refuse to<br/>
admit there might be a way to advance like that/crack<br/>
in my &#39;precious Everquest&#39;. Are you sure it was<br/>
Everquest? No don&#39;t kill me for asking!&quot; etc etc<br/>
etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Needless to say... it was a long long drive to take the<br/>
guy 1hr 1/2 out of my way to take him<br/>
home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
