<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-310640392">Well its me again, that faithful dark elf healer.<br/>
A couple of days ago i was hunting in dalnir. A<br/>
great lvling place for a lvl 26. And my puller pulled a<br/>
trian. Thats ok but what they didn&#39;t do is help<br/>
me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For those that don&#39;t know when a cleric heals the<br/>
tank all the free npcs are agroed by the heal and im<br/>
attacked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I died from this 3 times before i<br/>
disbanded the group and made another one. I&#39;m just venting<br/>
steam. I&#39;m tired of tanks not helping out there clerics.<br/>
we can&#39;t cast when attacked. so i don&#39;t see why a<br/>
tank would not drop what he was doing and save his<br/>
clerics behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I knwo what you thinking there<br/>
ane also clerics that try to tank and don&#39;t heal.<br/>
i&#39;ve grouped with these and always try to help them.<br/>
Teach them how to be a good ckeric. if they don&#39;t learn<br/>
they leave the party. My ranger knows too well about<br/>
healers that don&#39;t heal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I know i sound harsh<br/>
but yes I am venting. well this<br/>
is&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fefelafuw signing off.</div>
