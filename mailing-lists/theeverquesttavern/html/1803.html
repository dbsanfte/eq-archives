<div id="ygrps-yiv-951075767">Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s just jealous because he wasted<br/>
all that time playing a boring necro, and missed out<br/>
on the fun of being a druid. I know it&#39;s tough to<br/>
admit you&#39;re wrong, but just do it! Start your druid<br/>
char today and correct the errors of your past!! Want<br/>
a challenge?? Start a 1/2 elf druid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You<br/>
know, playing around with all those undead all the time<br/>
can give you a sour disposition too. I&#39;ve even seen<br/>
it from the pallys--who are generally good people,<br/>
if not a bit overzealous. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A little off<br/>
topic-- Necros are supposed to be really powerful, ok. I<br/>
RARELY see any on my server (xev), and have only grouped<br/>
with necros on a handful of occassions. (I group about<br/>
98% of the time-- i&#39;m a social druid who&#39;s NOT a<br/>
kiting fanatic). Where are they all?? Are the out<br/>
soloing, defiling graves (haha Kroq), or hanging out with<br/>
the undead? I&#39;ve always wanted to know this-- do the<br/>
ghouls, skellys, etc /con amiably to necros?? that would<br/>
be funny! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tunare&#39;s children grow in her<br/>
light and bless Norrath, while those unworthy of her<br/>
glory wither and die in the shadows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela<br/>
