<div id="ygrps-yiv-795880413">Alright, it took a lot of effort but finally got<br/>
a copy of Scars of Velious. Now I&#39;m only a level 7<br/>
monk and have no chance of going there any time soon<br/>
BUT...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love the new customize options. Now all I have to<br/>
do is redo my colors again. Trying to find a color<br/>
for text that works in Full Screen and the small<br/>
screen modes. Being able to get to inventory in Full<br/>
Screen ROCKS. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone else&#39;s opinions? To me the<br/>
customization options in and of themselves pay for the<br/>
expansion. But that&#39;s just me. Wish they did something<br/>
similar for the Spellcaster&#39;s mem. But I&#39;m sure they<br/>
didn&#39;t so the spell casters would still be unable to see<br/>
when memming new spells or what not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman,<br/>
