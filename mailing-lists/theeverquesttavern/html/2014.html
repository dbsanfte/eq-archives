<div id="ygrps-yiv-434124592">The Taskmaster is near the slave pits right<br/>
beside the Castle. You&#39;ll need a group to get him<br/>
because there are a lot of Legionaires around there and<br/>
they can be tough (especially for someone with very<br/>
few Hit Points). So when you get into Crushbone shout<br/>
that you are looking for a group or ask if you can<br/>
loot the Brass Earring from a group that is hunting<br/>
there. Just remember, don&#39;t go alone!! Around and inside<br/>
the castle is very dangerous for someone under level<br/>
12. It&#39;s very easy to get trained (ran over by lots<br/>
of orcs) in Crushbone. I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t have any<br/>
trouble getting a group, as enchanters are very helpful.<br/>
^_^ Good Luck!!</div>
