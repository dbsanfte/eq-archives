<b>Subject:</b> Ok I&#39;m new here, but I hoped that I&#39;d be <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408965580">able to find out what to do. See, I bought a<br/>
friend&#39;s EQ: Ruins of K. and I really don&#39;t know what to<br/>
do with it. &lt;br&gt;Since he was shipped out (military)<br/>
he didn&#39;t tell me much about it. Guess he took it<br/>
for granted that I&#39;d know all about it. &lt;br&gt;Well, I<br/>
installed it and then found out I couldn&#39;t use it cause I<br/>
don&#39;t have his information to access the<br/>
account!&lt;br&gt;From what I figure he didn&#39;t use it much either. But<br/>
how do I go about getting connected and all<br/>
that?&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m hoping to find out more about EQ here, so I won&#39;t<br/>
feel so blasted lost when I finally try it<br/>
out.&lt;br&gt;SO...any helpful suggestions?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady DM</div>
