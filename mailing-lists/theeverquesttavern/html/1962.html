<div id="ygrps-yiv-571257365">Well said. I don&#39;t agree with your arguement, but<br/>
it is well thought out. I think the problem is the<br/>
choices of his exclusivity. If he want a MI dating club,<br/>
fine, but then call it that. Not the<br/>
&quot;EverquestDatingClub&quot;, because it&#39;s not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps<br/>
MISingleStraightEverquestDatingClub is what he&#39;s really going for? I&#39;m not interested<br/>
in that kind of club...so I would have just skipped<br/>
right over that invite. That&#39;s an annoyance I can live<br/>
with...just like getting dieting e-mail and snail-mail, when<br/>
I&#39;m actually trying to gain weight! ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, no<br/>
bad feelings...let&#39;s all just get<br/>
along!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jim&lt;br&gt;CoJim, Woodelf Druid, 26th level, Prexus<br/>
