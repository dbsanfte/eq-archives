<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-547946951">well We did say that they&#39;d both use an equil<br/>
weapon so that clears that problem. But what ya mean<br/>
there aren&#39;t any SK weapons? I can think off 3 off of<br/>
my head; Reaper of the Dead (wich I weild myself),<br/>
Grobb Cleaver and Dark Reaver. and there ae several<br/>
more. None of those hower is a close mach to the fine<br/>
weapons that Paladins get. But we can only hope the new<br/>
weapons in the expansion are going to be better... But in<br/>
the main time... if anyone has a spare Dark Reaver<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to take it of yer hands :)</div>
