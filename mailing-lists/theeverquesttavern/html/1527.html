<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-871511681">&quot;In the beginning, there was loot. &lt;br&gt;And it was<br/>
good.&lt;br&gt;Then there was phat lewt twinkies.&lt;br&gt;And it pissed me<br/>
the hell off.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;:laughes hysterically and rolls<br/>
on the ground!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the input. Like I<br/>
said, maybe when I&#39;ve gone through the &quot;rites of<br/>
passage,&quot; i&#39;ll have a different view on twinking. Right<br/>
now, though, I&#39;m my lvl 20 druid is scratching his<br/>
head and saying &quot;runed mithril bracers&quot;? Man, can i<br/>
get those at my level?? haha!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW-- I have an<br/>
alt (lvl 18 mage)in unrest who has been killed quite<br/>
quickly by that dusty werebat. I hate Unrest trains.<br/>
