<div id="ygrps-yiv-786028674">Greeting fellow Norrathians. I am Guide Deamer<br/>
from the Quellious server.... Due to illegal actions<br/>
upon myself, I am under investigation by Verant. This<br/>
has caused me great distress because I have been<br/>
accused of many things that I did not do. I am under<br/>
investigation for only 3 months, and then they will decide if<br/>
my actions were bad enough to boot me from the<br/>
program... Here&#39;s my deal to you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	You may send me<br/>
your Station Name and Password to my email address,<br/>
along with the server you are playing on, and I will<br/>
give all your characters what I see fit. If you like,<br/>
you may include an exact list of what you want put on<br/>
this character...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	Now, I know this may sound<br/>
too good to be true, but Verant has really pissed me<br/>
off this time, and I will be booted in 3 months<br/>
anyway... You don&#39;t have much time to waste... Please Email<br/>
me at this address, and I will accomplish what I&#39;ve<br/>
always wanted to do... Get back at Verant, along with<br/>
you, getting the best things in the game for free...<br/>
Doesn&#39;t matter much to me, but if you want to be uber,<br/>
follow my directions,,,, It&#39;ll be done within the<br/>
night.... Being, and having a GM character, I can switch<br/>
from server to server, so this can apply to<br/>
EVERYONE...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for you support in my<br/>
endeavour....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asst. Guide Akiambo of the quellious<br/>
Server...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Quellious_GM_Deamer@...">Quellious_GM_Deamer@...</a></div>
