<div id="ygrps-yiv-531433685">Hide is also useful for enchanters to break their<br/>
charm spells without having to invis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some notes<br/>
about Hide for those that get it as a racial ability.<br/>
Your skill never improves from level one. You will<br/>
often fail with it. You will never be able to see<br/>
yourself when you Hide, even when you fail. But a good way<br/>
to tell if it worked is to target an agressive mob,<br/>
then Hide. Then /con the mob. If it now /cons<br/>
indifferent, the Hide worked, otherwise it failed.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This does not apply to all Kunark mobs, since some<br/>
/cons there are screwed up and many monsters will /con<br/>
agro to you even though you&#39;re invis, and some of them<br/>
aren&#39;t agro at all. Brutes in Warslik&#39;s Woods for<br/>
example. They /con agro, but aren&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this<br/>
helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar Mirraghost&lt;br&gt;30 DE Enchanter</div>
