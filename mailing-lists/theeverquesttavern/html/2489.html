<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710515658">I agree with the post for the most part except<br/>
for one addition. I&#39;d say you probably want to level<br/>
12 and 13 through the NRO area using derv groups.<br/>
They drop some +2 dex rings than sometimes can sell<br/>
for a plat piece and make for a good low level ring<br/>
to wear. Plus they&#39;re good experience and make for<br/>
interesting group experience. It&#39;s a good place to meet<br/>
people before moving on to a much more hectic and faster<br/>
paced Oasis zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
