<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-708439957">There is one taxi that does work. It&#39;s the only<br/>
one that I know that works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bard singing speed<br/>
song with a drum. They run you faster than SOW and<br/>
that&#39;s how a friend of mine got his bard some quick<br/>
plat. Running from FP to the Druid ring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s<br/>
not much plat but it&#39;s a bit. The only non-gate way<br/>
to taxi that I know ppl will still pay for. And<br/>
you&#39;re not going to find a whole lot of ppl that will<br/>
but enough that it&#39;s worth while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
