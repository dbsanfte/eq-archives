<br/>
 my name is leo. im a network engineer, who has become<br/>
addicted to eq like the rest of us. also about your<br/>
issue with the scars of veloius? is the cd a new cd?<br/>
or is it an old disc and your installing the software<br/>
onto a new pc? or is the pc an older model? which<br/>
operating system are you using to begin with? ie.<br/>
which version of windows are you running? what<br/>
processor? and how much ram do u have? now please<br/>
reply to me and ill see what i can do about helping<br/>
you. as for if your missing a cab file from your<br/>
windows registry. then you need to get an antivirus<br/>
program such as norton 2003 or mc affee, i have norton<br/>
and i live by it, its the best. if you dont i suggest<br/>
you download the freeware from www.symantec.com . and<br/>
look for the norton 2003 free download, and check your<br/>
pc for any viruses. after you do so i suggest that you<br/>
run the windows update, just go to the start button<br/>
after your logged online, and scroll up to the<br/>
shortcut of windows update, follow the instructions<br/>
and download all of the available updates, this brings<br/>
your pc up to standards, if your on dial-up this is a<br/>
head ache, let me fore warn you, after every update<br/>
you will be prompted to restart your pc, whice you<br/>
must do before you can continue. if your on dsl or<br/>
cable the downloads are fairly fast. hence do these<br/>
things and contact me or the eq tech support if the<br/>
problems continue to persist. have a nice day.<br/>
