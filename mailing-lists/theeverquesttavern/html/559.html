<b>Subject:</b> Will trade powerleveling on Karana <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376998042">Hi, I have a level 30 Barb Shaman on Karana. I<br/>
have other characters I&#39;d like to get to 20 or so. If<br/>
you have a higher level character maybe we could swap<br/>
leveling sessions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contact me or email me if that<br/>
would interest you. Also I am in Pacific timezone and<br/>
play in the evening about 3 days a week. I&#39;m not<br/>
really a big fan of powerleveling, but my time is a<br/>
consideration. My Shaman has about 30 days played, so I&#39;ve paid<br/>
my dues, so to speak.</div>
