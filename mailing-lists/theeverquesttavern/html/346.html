<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807889760">If you can teleport, I would appreciate some help<br/>
over in Greater Fay. The reason I asked about the<br/>
install thing is because I lag really bad in some places<br/>
(like the Butcherblok Docks) and I just sit there<br/>
loading. I can never move nor camp. Eventually I am forced<br/>
to manually shut down. One time, I was lagging at<br/>
the docks and was killed by an aqua goblin. If I had<br/>
tried to get my stuff, I would have froze again. It<br/>
wasn&#39;t a big deal (thanks to my &quot;monk&quot;iness), but a good<br/>
friend helped me out and looted for me (thanks<br/>
Minamas!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, I am needing to learn some moves I am<br/>
overdue on. If anyone can teleport me to Freeport I would<br/>
be very gratefull.</div>
