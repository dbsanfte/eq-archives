<div id="ygrps-yiv-383242001">I was just wondering, how many leave there<br/>
&#39;status&#39; normal? You know, /who tells level class name<br/>
guild. I use /role with my warrior and get constantly<br/>
asked for heals, buffs, sows. I guess a wood elf<br/>
warrior is kind of rare. My druid stays fully<br/>
identifiable. /who tells you all about him. And yet, believe it<br/>
or not, I rarely am asked to sow or buff/heal<br/>
people. I also find it amusing of the number of people<br/>
who /shout need sow plz constantly but never check to<br/>
see who can do it. They just expect someone to be<br/>
able/willing to do so at their command. And some of them don&#39;t<br/>
have any patience. I don&#39;t keep sow memmed. I have<br/>
wolf form. Who need spirit when you can be one? You<br/>
tell them just a sec while I mem it, they say NM and<br/>
run off. :P to them. If you&#39;re on the Rathe and I&#39;m<br/>
around, send me a tell that you saw me on this board and<br/>
I&#39;ll sow you if you&#39;re close by.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye<br/>
