<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480913135">If you have ever played a wizard class you would<br/>
know what we are talking about!! If you have he isn&#39;t<br/>
to high lvl!! If you don&#39;tr think that hands down<br/>
this is the hardest class to lvland play (besides<br/>
maybe rogue) then you had better play the game a little<br/>
more!!!</div>
