<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-430059676">Holy Crud, Bev. Did you sign up for a feature or anything like that?<br/>
Have you asked for an itemized statement for what they say you owe?<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
No wonder Ebay makes to much money. I list &quot;ONE&quot; item for sell <br/>
thinking the price they say it is $15 and change and I get a bill for <br/>
(&quot;Non-Payment of $132.86 Balance on your eBay account&quot;). These people <br/>
go ripping other people off. I will never use their service again and <br/>
I would hope other people don&#39;t end up in my situation! Sorry for <br/>
venting but this is complete BS.<br/>
