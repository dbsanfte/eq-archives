Lake Rathe is actually a part of Antonica.  From the sounds of it  the<br/>
gnolls you are talking about are near the South Karana zone.  I don&#39;t<br/>
remember when Bards get the Equivalent of sow  nor do I remember when they<br/>
get Invis song.  But if you can find someone who can float you so you don&#39;t<br/>
have to wear yourself out on swimming form the Arena, Invis and sow you  or<br/>
even accompany you  then that would be the best route for you to go.<br/>
Suggestion as well if you want to hunt in Qeynos get someone to bind you  at<br/>
the Gates of the City of Qeynos so if you die again you don&#39;t have to worry<br/>
about the gnolls any more<br/>

&gt; Hail, And well me John.  You say you have a vast<br/>
&gt; knowledge of Kunark?? well, maybe you can help me.  I<br/>
&gt; have a lvl 9 half-elf bard and he is stuck respawning<br/>
&gt; in the arena, both surrounding zones are empty, but,<br/>
&gt; whenever I try to leave Rathetear Lake I always meet<br/>
&gt; up with some gnoll shamans and get slaughtered....<br/>
&gt; One might ask how in all the worlds I got a lvl 9 bard<br/>
&gt; safely to The Arena,  Lets just say I abused SoW a<br/>
&gt; little, I was spawning in Qeynos, and was trying to<br/>
&gt; reach Freeport, and got lost somewhere in the<br/>
&gt; middle... Any assistance in theis matter would be<br/>
&gt; greatly appreciated,<br/>
&gt;      Stauchnad Tier Ss&#39;Faleen<br/>
&gt;      Lowly Bard with big dreams.<br/>
