<div id="ygrps-yiv-838356256">There&#39;s also the fact that they can heal a bubble<br/>
every few minutes. MUCH less downtime than a warrior<br/>
when going solo. Besides, it&#39;s just fun to watch them<br/>
fight.&lt;br&gt;On the &quot;Well rounded&quot; stats though, i&#39;ve never had<br/>
problems with them. As spellcasters they may not get quite<br/>
as much mana as, for example, Erudites or High<br/>
Elves, but they can take hits better. And no finger<br/>
waggler can hide behind a tank forever. And as warriors<br/>
they may not do the raw damage ogres do, but they<br/>
learn skills, including combat skills easier, get<br/>
better prices, etc.&lt;br&gt;That, and some people just want<br/>
to ROLE-PLAY a human. Or an Ogre. Or a wizzie. Or<br/>
anything else.&lt;br&gt;This is a role-playing game after all,<br/>
people. One that&#39;s a lot more interactive than most<br/>
computer R.P.G&#39;s. So find a class/race you want to<br/>
role-play, and have fun with it. ^-^</div>
