<div id="ygrps-yiv-897694440">That&#39;s so funny. I&#39;ve been playing since late<br/>
2000, and I still don&#39;t have a char over lvl 50. (I<br/>
changed my main so many times, and have enough levels in<br/>
alts to have 5 lvl 60 chars at least). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still<br/>
remember, though, my first days playing. I did the tutorial<br/>
(does it even exist still?), created a char. that I<br/>
thought would be cool, taking into account<br/>
roleplay-ability (which is non-existant on most servers). It took<br/>
me nearly 1/2 hour to get my gnome magician picked<br/>
out with the stats, face, name and religeon that I<br/>
wanted. Then I played the game. Then I /camp and tried<br/>
the tutorial again!!! hahahaha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I chose the Xev<br/>
server, because it was very new at the time. I was still<br/>
afraid to group until lv 9, because I still didn&#39;t know<br/>
everything to do. I actually bought a tailoring book and<br/>
began to make my own clothes out of necessity. There<br/>
were very few people in Steamfont who gave away<br/>
things. I was afraid to leave Steamfont until level 10,<br/>
and only then because I got a quest that told me of<br/>
this strange place where orcs were (Crushbone). I had<br/>
no idea what the /assist key was, I had no idea how<br/>
to make macros, I didn&#39;t know the value of anything<br/>
and just banked all my cash once I got a full set of<br/>
cloth armor or the occassional odd drop that a mage<br/>
could use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s so funny to thing back to that.<br/>
At level 14 I realized that I could take a boat to<br/>
other places, and went to Antonicus for the first time.<br/>
(this was after some problems in OOT, because I got off<br/>
the boat at the docks thinking I was in Freeport). I<br/>
never made it to the Commonlands, because I only found<br/>
the zone to SRo once I got off the boat. (I think I<br/>
only went to Freeport initially to do a quest). I died<br/>
many times in SRo and then Oasis. I eventually got to<br/>
lvl 20, and learned about the focus items. Most<br/>
everything I did was based on word of mouth, because I had<br/>
not found any of the web sites yet. I went back to<br/>
OOT because someone told me that you could get all<br/>
kinds of Giant Toes there. It was true, but the mobs<br/>
were WAY red-- so I bought them from druids kiting<br/>
Gornit and Cyclopses. Toes sell to merchant for less<br/>
than a plat, but I bought them for 10pp each (much to<br/>
the joy of the druids, and to my chagrin when I found<br/>
out that the toes were worthless to them anyway).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I then spent time in Najena (boy, hard to get a<br/>
group there), trying to get shovels and brooms and<br/>
torches. Got one, and then someone told me it was easier<br/>
to find them in Cazic Thule. So off I went and spen<br/>
to lvl 23 in CT. I finally realized that INT was<br/>
important to a mage, and that my stats were all messed up.<br/>
Time to start over... Of all my alts that have come<br/>
and gone, that one is still in my lineup (though I<br/>
haven&#39;t played the mage for almost a year). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just<br/>
funny to look back and realize that we were all noobs.<br/>
I thought AOE spells were the best things on<br/>
Norrath!! I looked for stackable only loot so I didn&#39;t have<br/>
to sell so soon after filling up my one back and<br/>
remaining slots. LOL</div>
