<div id="ygrps-yiv-868883848">Hello to all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I have a Druid that is lvl<br/>
18 and would like ideas of places to visit to get<br/>
more exp and money since ive heard that my next spells<br/>
r going to be expensive and from lvl 24 and up will<br/>
become more expensive. Im currently in Oasis and<br/>
sometimes visit Najena with my guild, I heard that Lake<br/>
Rathe is a very cool place to be and Cazic Thule but Im<br/>
not so sure about the later. &lt;br&gt;Well thanks in<br/>
advance for any info u may give me and may Tunare protect<br/>
you all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyrianie, Druid of the Fourth Circle</div>
