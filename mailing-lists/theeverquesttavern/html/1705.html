<b>Subject:</b> Re: Seperate CCs? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-899424559">I have two computers, and a separate EQ account<br/>
for each of them. Used the same CC no problem, but I<br/>
had to get a second game, it was the easiest option<br/>
for a separate computer as I saw it.(I got the new<br/>
$10 classic pack, just the original Norrath world, no<br/>
Kunark or Velious on that one.) &lt;br&gt;If you only have the<br/>
one computer, but want to have a second account on<br/>
that, you don&#39;t need to go out and buy another copy of<br/>
the game, but you WILL need to call customer service<br/>
and purchase a new CD-Key for the second account. A<br/>
friend of mine did this, and I can&#39;t remember exactly<br/>
how much it cost, but it was about the same price as<br/>
a new game w/ the expansions, maybe a tiny bit<br/>
less.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Short answer: one credit card regardless, One CD Key<br/>
for EACH account (and that you get either by buying a<br/>
new copy of the game or calling Verant Customer<br/>
Service.</div>
