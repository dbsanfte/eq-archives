<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-968957918">Can anyone tell me how to make or where to find the instructions on <br/>
how to make it so I can dye my armor?  If any of you are on Eci&#39; look <br/>
up either Tunais or Shatteredreams they are the ones whose armor I <br/>
want to dye if you have the agents I would be willing to buy them <br/>
from you.  My e-mail is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:whisper1423@...">whisper1423@...</a> if you want to let me <br/>
know when you will be on so I can get them from you.  &#92;<br/>

Thanks <br/>
