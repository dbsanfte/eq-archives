<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187819613">The best advice I could give you is to go to<br/>
EQATLAS (&lt;a href=http://www.eqatlas.com target=new&gt;http://www.eqatlas.com&lt;/a&gt;) and start printing the<br/>
maps there. They are probably the best maps of Norrath<br/>
around, and the grids on them allow you to figure out<br/>
your /loc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been to<br/>
OT, but I do remember it&#39;s a little tricky to get to.<br/>
Sow yourself, camo, levitate and head north. There a<br/>
somewhat hidden valley that leads to OT from FM.</div>
