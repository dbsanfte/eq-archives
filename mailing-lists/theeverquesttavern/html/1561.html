<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368237370">OK, but I&#39;m still unclear on this. I died twice<br/>
last night at level 11 . . . but from what I could<br/>
tell, I think I only lost the blue bar of experience,<br/>
not the orange. Is that how it works? Or am I really<br/>
10th level now, and just haven&#39;t noticed. Yeah, that<br/>
would really stink . . . !&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
