<div id="ygrps-yiv-507609657">If I had meant my statement to be insulting, I<br/>
would have added &quot;moron&quot; or &quot;nitwit&quot; at the end. Again,<br/>
believe it or not, some people do not read their manuals<br/>
- laziness, lack of time, extra challenge, whatever<br/>
reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From your post, you said, &quot;You said as though she was<br/>
stupid or something...&quot; How do you know what I meant?<br/>
It&#39;s text. Different conclusions can be drawn from it.<br/>
It&#39;s not like you can hear the tone in my voice<br/>
because there is no voice. Don&#39;t tell me what I meant by<br/>
my own statements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I offended you, I am<br/>
sorry. I was meaning to help, despite the opinions of a<br/>
few nosy people.</div>
