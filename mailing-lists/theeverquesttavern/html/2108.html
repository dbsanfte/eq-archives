<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299242900">Need a bit more info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First thing of<br/>
course, is waiting a few hours as well as restarting the<br/>
computer. If it still does it, is there any programs being<br/>
run while you&#39;re running EQ? If so, make sure all<br/>
programs have been shut down other than EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also,<br/>
have you tried to uninstall, reinstall? That might<br/>
help. Another thing to look for are changes to the<br/>
computer between when it was working correctly and when it<br/>
was acting up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those are the basics that clear<br/>
up about 75% of all problems similar to those you&#39;re<br/>
describing. (When uninstalling/reinstalling-- you might want<br/>
to backup the eqclient.ini file)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
