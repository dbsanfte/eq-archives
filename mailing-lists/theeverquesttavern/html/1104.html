<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-507732313">Holy crap. I can see this coming. First<br/>
Ebay...now full character creation/outfitting for RL<br/>
money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t you guys get it? Money has no place in EQ. Get a<br/>
job like the other 99% of us have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
understand if you feel you need to Ebay your character to<br/>
finally quit, or if you are in financial plight. But when<br/>
you make money on it over and over, it&#39;s just wrong,<br/>
in my opinion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar Alazeem&lt;br&gt;Warrior of<br/>
