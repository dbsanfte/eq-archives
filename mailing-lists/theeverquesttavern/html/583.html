<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028639932">get a new account and stop playing this char so<br/>
you can start fresh....you can even transfer the<br/>
equipment really easy, and dont worry level 10 is nothing<br/>
to worry about...and yes you are violating the thing<br/>
you click agree to when you share an account, if i<br/>
had to get a new account at my lvl i would get a<br/>
friend to power lvl my char...sometimes you can even<br/>
delete the char and create a new one with the same name<br/>
immediately, if you got attatched to the name&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;okie i<br/>
have babbled enough,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elif &lt;br&gt;level 31 ranger<br/>
