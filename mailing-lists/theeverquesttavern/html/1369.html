<div id="ygrps-yiv-543823609">1) Server: There&#39;s a list of servers. So it&#39;s<br/>
easy to tell which one you&#39;re on. You can have up to 8<br/>
character per server. I have characters on Drinal and<br/>
Veeshan and I can&#39;t honestly remember what other servers.<br/>
LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for PK.. there are PK only servers, as well as<br/>
team PK servers that are dependant on your race.<br/>
There&#39;s also regular servers in which you choose to be PK<br/>
or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Agility and Dex are pretty much<br/>
resolved as the stats of choice for Rogues. They dodge and<br/>
attack faster with those two stats as well as backstab<br/>
better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, all the stats are good. Even<br/>
Charisma to a certain degree. I recommend going to sites<br/>
like Everlore.com or &lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.stomped.com/">http://eq.stomped.com/</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.stomped.com/&lt;/a">http://eq.stomped.com/&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look up<br/>
some info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Up to you. For example, I spend<br/>
my skill points on Languages, some trade skills that<br/>
are expensive to practice like Jewelry and Pottery,<br/>
and skills at later levels for my guild that can be<br/>
learned only by spending at least one point first.<br/>
Overall... up to you though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Clans or guilds are<br/>
great. A lot of ppl join them and they help you get<br/>
items and find people to group with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being<br/>
said, I haven&#39;t joined one yet myself as I&#39;m looking<br/>
for the guild that I think will fit my personality<br/>
best. Guilds also should, IMHO be the group that you<br/>
have FUN with. People you like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) have fun..<br/>
