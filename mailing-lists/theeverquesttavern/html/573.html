<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539250570">I&#39;m new here and I have a question for the<br/>
experts in the group...is there a way to transfer a<br/>
character from one account to another? I started my<br/>
character on my son&#39;s account (not expecting to get<br/>
hooked...just thought it would be for a day or two and then I<br/>
would delete...little did I know LOL!!!!) I have spent<br/>
a lot of time and effort to develop my character<br/>
and would hate to have to delete her and start over<br/>
when I get my own account.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks in advance<br/>
for your help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jasmy &lt;br&gt;Level 10 (almost<br/>
