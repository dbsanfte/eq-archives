<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447358664">Hi to the EQ group, I am known as Surrea Devine (druid) on Nameless <br/>
server. Also, have a chanter on there i just started by Etherea.. I <br/>
started playing 7 months ago, and i really enjoy it. I am 35, single <br/>
mom of 4 boys, go to college, and work top of that. But i am still <br/>
drawn or compelled to the life of EQ. LOL! An addiction maybe? I <br/>
would like to get to know other peeps in the land of EQ. Maybe a <br/>
soulmate on there too.. If you want to know more about me just <br/>
message me online messenger. Let&#39;s get this game kicking!!! Shari..</div>
