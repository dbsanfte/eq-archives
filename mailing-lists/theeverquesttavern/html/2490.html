<div id="ygrps-yiv-507667288">Hrmm.. that&#39;s the error I got when I had DirectX<br/>
8.0 instead of 8.1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assuming you&#39;re using<br/>
Windows-- go to start-&gt;Run-&gt;type in<br/>
dxdiag&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After you click okay... make sure it says under DirectX<br/>
version 8.1 (4.08.01.0881)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;you might have a<br/>
slightly different build but for the most part.. those<br/>
numbers should almost match up perfect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If those<br/>
work, then go onto the next few pages and run all the<br/>
DX tests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you pass all of those... check<br/>
the EQ website. I know they had some problems with<br/>
some AMD chipsets and some video cards but most of<br/>
that&#39;s listed in the FAQ/Troubleshooting stuff on the EQ<br/>
website.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that doesn&#39;t help, call their tech support. They<br/>
might be able to come up with something for you. I know<br/>
a lot of people have that error msg. If you&#39;ve got<br/>
Win95-- I don&#39;t think you can play any more<br/>
BTW.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
