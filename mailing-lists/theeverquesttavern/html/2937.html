<b>Subject:</b> A question for you all <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145115889">This may sound kind of dumb but I used to play EQ and stopped for a <br/>
long while.  I don&#39;t have my discs anymore I was wondering if I could <br/>
install the whole game from Shadows of Luclin or do I need to buy the <br/>
triology pac along with Luclin.  I am trying to save some money and <br/>
maybee get buy with only having to buy one pac.  Any help you all may <br/>
have would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
