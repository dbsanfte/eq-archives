<b>Subject:</b> Gaining 20! ..and losing it... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006772693">Well, a couple days ago I made 20.... And I&#39;m<br/>
going to share a little story with you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ..I had<br/>
just gotten level 20, and decided to take a trip to<br/>
Erudin. Well, I got there and was looking through the<br/>
jewels, trying to select a perfect wedding ring. (for my<br/>
fiance, who needs strength) Eventually, I chose one and<br/>
sent a /tell to my higher level Enchanter friend who<br/>
is skilled in Jewelcraft! Well, he said he&#39;d meet me<br/>
in WC, so I tellyed there ( I LOVE being a Druid!)<br/>
And had JUST given him the stone for the ring<br/>
when...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A Dragoon guy of some sort showed up, and killed<br/>
me right then and there. All the higher levels who<br/>
were around me seemed to be laughing... Hehe..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>
..And so, I lost level 20, was sent BACK to Erudin,<br/>
then tellyed back to WC, got my corpse and the new<br/>
rings. My fiance felt somewhat guilty about the whole<br/>
thing..BUT.. Hehe, twas my own fault for not using INVIS when<br/>
I got into WC. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Happy ending though! The<br/>
ring is PERFECT, I regained level 20, and..Well, me<br/>
an&#39; my fiance are STILL trying to set a wedding date<br/>
and place...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Well, just a little story!<br/>
:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; See you in Norrath!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ~Teppeny<br/>
