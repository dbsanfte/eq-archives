<div id="ygrps-yiv-312803652">Ouch, i had a bad experience with the use of<br/>
auto-follow. I was leading my groupmate through the South<br/>
deasert of Ro, when i see him go down a steeper hill and<br/>
take just enough to kill him...&lt;br&gt;The next thing on<br/>
my screen is a message that says &quot;You have slain<br/>
*****!&quot;(i wont say the name) &quot;your faction with most humans<br/>
has gone down!&quot; My mouth drops 10 feet irl, i rushed<br/>
back to freeport to the Ikthars armor to check the<br/>
price on plate. AGH what do you mean 300pp for a plate<br/>
bracer?!?!?! i bought it for 266. So i sat around for 2 days<br/>
untill a GM actually got to me. After checking for about<br/>
15 min, The GM told me that there was no way for him<br/>
or me to change my faction back, and just saying he<br/>
would log it as a bug! So basically i put 15 points<br/>
into my starting charisma for nothing. I think thats<br/>
badly designed because a group member could be<br/>
auto-following you without you knowing it. Sure the follower<br/>
gets a message saying the y might fall in pits, but<br/>
they dont loose any exp! In my opinion the real danger<br/>
is to the leader, if you have a weak member and<br/>
unsteady factions this could ruin you character. I felt i<br/>
had to warn as many people as possible aobut this.<br/>
Have any ideas on helping my faction or have opinions<br/>
on the subject please post a message.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin<br/>
