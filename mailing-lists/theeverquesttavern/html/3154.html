I knew things could only get so bad before they started to look up... <br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I go in for the drug testing portion, than orientation for <br/>
the job I am getting. Thankfully I follow rules, laws, and try to do <br/>
my best in life so no worries! The teacher/parent meeting let me know <br/>
my son was above his class. He&#39;s at the level now in the first of <br/>
three trimesters that he should be by the end of the year. Today he <br/>
brought home another award, I&#39;m sure he has all 4 &quot;As&quot; so I&#39;ll owe <br/>
him $20, and he&#39;s behaving very well. With his award he gets his <br/>
picture taken and put on a local restaurants wall as well as a free <br/>
dinner.  <br/>
<br/>
I make it a point to frame and hang Vincent&#39;s awards and achievements <br/>
so he&#39;s driven to do his best and aime high in life. At the same time <br/>
the few times he does see his dad it helps to keep his self-esteem <br/>
high when his father does something to lower it. <br/>
<br/>
We are one step closer to our family goals!! We want to buy a 4 <br/>
bedroom house. My fianc├⌐ will have his own computer room, privacy, <br/>
and can do basically what he wants with his space. Vincent was <br/>
promised a dog when we get a house and I hope he keeps up with <br/>
cleaning up after it, feeding it, and making sure it has water. I on <br/>
the other hand only care about having a big kitchen with a center <br/>
island. Plus, we still have to think about our goals to get married, <br/>
the dress will probably be the highest price tag. The photographer, <br/>
video, church, flowers, his tuxedo, my son&#39;s little tuxedo, and <br/>
plenty food.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t Quit <br/>
<br/>
When things go wrong and they sometimes will, <br/>
When the road you&#39;re trudging seems all uphill, <br/>
When funds are low and debts are high, <br/>
And you want to smile but only sigh, <br/>
When care is pressing you down a bit, <br/>
Rest if you must, but don&#39;t you quit. <br/>
<br/>
Life is strange with its twists and turns, <br/>
As every one of us sometimes learns, <br/>
And many a failure turns about, <br/>
When he might have won had he stuck it out, <br/>
Don&#39;t give up though the pace seems slow, <br/>
You may succeed with another blow. <br/>
<br/>
Success is failure turned inside out, <br/>
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt, <br/>
And you can never tell how close you are, <br/>
It seems so near when it seems so far; <br/>
So stick to the fight when hardest hit, <br/>
It&#39;s when things go wrong that you must not quit.<br/>
