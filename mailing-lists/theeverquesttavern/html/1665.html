<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343696970">Hmm.... Rangers can churn out some damage... but<br/>
then so can wizards. Both are pretty fun to play, so<br/>
it really just matches what you want. I&#39;ve seen a<br/>
mid-40s ranger burn through the Temple of Cazic Thule<br/>
without breaking a sweat, but then I&#39;ve seen a close to<br/>
50 wizard nuke the hell out of anything that moves,<br/>
from large rats to hill giants.&lt;br&gt;Me personally I<br/>
would choose a ranger over a wizard, but then I never<br/>
really got into the pure caster classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai<br/>
