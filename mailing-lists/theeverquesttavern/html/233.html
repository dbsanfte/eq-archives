<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120578421">Sheesh...lvl 30 really sucks. It&#39;s 3 lvls<br/>
combined into one, plus 25% more exp since i&#39;m a ranger<br/>
(hybrid class). I&#39;ve spent quite a few nights going solo<br/>
against lizard sentinels, defenders, and protectors in<br/>
Cazic and i&#39;m only halfway to 31. =(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW for<br/>
those of you who haven&#39;t noticed, i don&#39;t have any<br/>
screenshots posted on this site yet. This is because it took<br/>
to long to upload the pics. But they&#39;ll be up very<br/>
soon since i just discovered that they were Bitmaps!!<br/>
i tried to upload 2MB pics lol! Some of the pics<br/>
are pretty cool - some are battles vs giants and<br/>
cyclops, and some are just plain funny. Hope you enjoy<br/>
them!</div>
