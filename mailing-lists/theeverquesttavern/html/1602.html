<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019104441">&quot;Lonely cleric&quot;? What game are YOU playing? Most<br/>
clerics will find a group regardless as to WHERE they go.<br/>
A good cleric will enable a group to fight things<br/>
on average 3 or 4 levels higher than they were<br/>
fighting previously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just make sure your cleric<br/>
knows their job, and isn&#39;t tossing nukes out there in<br/>
battle when it&#39;s unnecessary. That kind of cleric will<br/>
get you killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And clerics kick ass in PvP.<br/>
Flash of Light, Stun, all those neat little 1st level<br/>
spells can be deadly in PvP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral<br/>
