<b>Subject:</b> Lag Question? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050580528">Ok, here&#39;s the deal . . . I have 320mb ram, which<br/>
should be more than enough to run EQ. I do have SoL but<br/>
have been installing and uninstalling it to see if I<br/>
can fix my problem which, btw, does not help. I also<br/>
have a cable modem so I KNOW I have a fast connection!<br/>
But even though I have enough memory and a good<br/>
internet connection I am STILL extremely laggy. It takes<br/>
me forever to zone and I can hardly move in the<br/>
game. SoL apparently has nothing to do with it since it<br/>
is the same whether it&#39;s installed or uninstalled.<br/>
But I DO have a pretty crappy video card. So, I was<br/>
wondering if that was the problem,and if I got a better and<br/>
new video card if it would help make EQ run faster?<br/>
On a diff computer it had a better video card, a<br/>
little slower of a connection, and just about the same<br/>
memory and it only took me 13 seconds to log into the<br/>
game! And it took no time to zone either. So does<br/>
anyone think that if I get a little more memory, say<br/>
516mb ram, and a better video card, that it will run<br/>
faster? Any info would be great! Seeing that I am getting<br/>
more frustrated every minute! Nothing seems to work<br/>
for me =(</div>
