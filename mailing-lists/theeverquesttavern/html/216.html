<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141317625">I had the scare of my life! Errr... maybe not<br/>
that drastic....&lt;br&gt;I was fishing in North Qeynos over<br/>
by Crow&#39;s when I fell in and forgot how to swim.<br/>
Before I could drown, I shut off my puter. I thought I<br/>
had drowned and was cursing myself on having to start<br/>
from Surefall Glades with no armor or weapons or my<br/>
beloved brew. But when I played the game yesterday, I<br/>
started out with a full bar of air in the bottom of the<br/>
pond! I had read the book guide after I had shut down<br/>
the puter yesterday, and so I know knew how to swim.<br/>
I swam to top and got out! :) :) :) The only<br/>
problems I had to face after that was that I had no drink,<br/>
and the stupid thing was lagging. So I&#39;m in Sneed&#39;s<br/>
right now TRYING to make a purchase.</div>
