<b>Subject:</b> Cleric Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243850459">I am a lvl 38 cleric on the Tallen Zek server and<br/>
was wondering about quests that i can do to get<br/>
wisdom gear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hear a lot about Low guk, but<br/>
only been ther ounce. Not much was found. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So<br/>
if anyone has heard of amy quest items that i can go<br/>
for don&#39;t be afraid to drop a line. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One other<br/>
thing. I have a awsome weapon. All the quests i have<br/>
found are for weapons. Armor would be the<br/>
best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thankyou Fefelafuw Pez&lt;br&gt;Cleric 38&lt;br&gt;Tallen Zek</div>
