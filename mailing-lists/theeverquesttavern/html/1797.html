<div id="ygrps-yiv-382938214">At level 39 here is my top 5 list for creating<br/>
aggro upon myself. By keeping the mob taunted upon<br/>
myself, I allow the tanks to backstab/attack from the<br/>
back while I jog around in a circle and the nukers can<br/>
nuke from afar in peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Damage shield (of<br/>
Spikes) - but not needed with this tactic&lt;br&gt;4. Snare (as<br/>
you said easily taunted off by tanks)&lt;br&gt;3. Immolate<br/>
(mobs don&#39;t like fire, especially that clinging<br/>
type)&lt;br&gt;2. Firestrike (again, mobs and fire don&#39;t mix)&lt;br&gt;1.<br/>
Fury of Air (Nuke him and he&#39;ll run at you, no matter<br/>
what else is going on.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This allows for a<br/>
carrot-on-a-stick sort of group attacking... only costs me a snare,<br/>
immolate, and one fury and the tanks/other nukers can have<br/>
a hey-day with the mob as I run around waving my<br/>
wolfformed tail at him in relative safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai<br/>
