<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651738773">i was just wondering if any good armor was<br/>
available to wizards outside of quests. like a robe or<br/>
somethin? i still have the same green crap i got in the<br/>
beggining. &lt;br&gt;also, what would you say about the lesser<br/>
faydarks difficulty? is it a place that a party is<br/>
important?</div>
