<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774396346">y&#39;know, I don&#39;t care if he makes a buck or two...<br/>
but there are other places to post such things. I<br/>
merely put a logical reason why no one should buy them.<br/>
The dangers of someone not knowing how to survive in<br/>
a level 52 PvP environment is tremendous.&lt;br&gt;On a<br/>
side note: Why put so much time into something and<br/>
then just give it up?&lt;br&gt;And to anyone considering it:<br/>
for your own safety... ask for a detailed list of<br/>
every item the characters have, what factions may have<br/>
been severly hampered (i.e. did he kill a bunch of<br/>
dwarfs making Thurgadin off limits?), if you have an<br/>
account ask to inspect the individual characters. Be<br/>
thourough. Be a smart buyer (like buying accounts<br/>
qualifies...)&lt;br&gt;And on another side note: I am ashamed of you! Both<br/>
the buyer and the seller. Playing a paladin, knight<br/>
of honor indeed.. pfff.... &lt;br&gt;And if someone is<br/>
trying to tell me that it won&#39;t happen, it probably will<br/>
and I know it... but I feel that is my duty to<br/>
withhold the honor and the integrity of EQ and Norrath<br/>
itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf</div>
