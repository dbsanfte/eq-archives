<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320251768">All this makes me just not want to be a Druid! I<br/>
often just walk up to folks and say hello, but the<br/>
begging for SoWs or other stuff has jaded them so much<br/>
that they often say, &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m not a Druid.&quot; Fine, I<br/>
was just trying to say hello. I rarely ask for SoW<br/>
(although I love to have it when hiding/sneaking), but for<br/>
the rare occasions when I do, I&#39;ve actually hotkeyed<br/>
a social RP request. &quot;I am on a mission from my<br/>
guild masters . . . Would you be so kind as to bestow<br/>
Spirit of Wolf on me, if you could?&quot; It comes out as a<br/>
couple of lines, but that&#39;s OK. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two funny things<br/>
happened in the last couple of days, sort of germane to<br/>
this discussion. Last night, I died in Crushbone and<br/>
had to run back all nekkid. I got a bit twisted<br/>
around, and had to ask directions. Watched politely (and<br/>
not hidden) as some big Barb killed a centurion, then<br/>
said, &quot;Excuse me, which direction is the entrance to<br/>
Crushbone?&quot; And he walked away to go kill some more stuff.<br/>
Hmph. I wandered around a bit more, getting my bearings<br/>
. . . and came across him fighting three or four<br/>
centurions. And for all his nice shiny armor (a major<br/>
twink,perhaps?!), they stomped this Barb into the ground. I was<br/>
hiding/sneaking, and it was sort of fun to watch. Felt like adding<br/>
a comment like &quot;Be polite next time and you might<br/>
get some help!&quot;, but I refrained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this one<br/>
from two nights ago is better . . . even though it&#39;s a<br/>
long story. Whenever I go to Kelethin, when I see a<br/>
fellow Dwarf I tend to stop and say hello. I kind of<br/>
dislike the place (very high platforms, and it&#39;s very<br/>
confusing), and it&#39;s nice to see a friendly face. So I saw a<br/>
Dwarf and said hello, and we got to talking. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
noticed a Wood Elf nearby with the same surname, and<br/>
asked if that was his partner. He said yes, they had<br/>
met while adventuring, etc. She SoWed me and they<br/>
cast a couple of other buffs on me. I told him he was<br/>
a lucky Dwarf . . . &quot;She has a sister, you know!&quot; I<br/>
demurred, saying I wouldn&#39;t want to impose the life of a<br/>
Rogue on anyone (and besides, my real-life wife would<br/>
have a cow). So the Wood Elf Druid mentioned the name<br/>
of her sister . . . and I realized I had adventured<br/>
with her! We hooked up once in Butcherblock to kill a<br/>
Fire Drake, and she later suggested we meet the next<br/>
day. She had some scarab armor she wanted to give me.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The server had died the next night, however, so we<br/>
never got together again. Her sister then said, &quot;Wait<br/>
here, she asked me to give you something if I ever met<br/>
you.&quot; So she ran to the bank and came back with a some<br/>
Scarab boots and a Splitpaw Belt -- both were marked<br/>
improvements over what I had on. It was great -- meeting<br/>
someone in character, having a conversation, getting some<br/>
buffs and some items just for being in the moment.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s what makes this game great.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course,<br/>
then the newbie who had been bugging me all night for<br/>
items or gold showed up, asking me to show her (a him,<br/>
really) who to give the bard letters to. Said s/he had a<br/>
20-something level warrior on another server . . . and here<br/>
s/he is, begging for items as a first-level HE<br/>
magician. Couldn&#39;t even get the dang letter from the bard<br/>
in Felwithe -- I had to tell her to answer with the<br/>
words in brackets!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s what makes the game<br/>
not so fun sometimes, although it was good to help<br/>
someone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gee, maybe I should do some work today . . .<br/>
