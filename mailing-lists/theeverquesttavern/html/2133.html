<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961607347">I am using Windows ME and when I updated to 7.0,<br/>
EQ went nuts and was lagging all of the time. When I<br/>
went back to 6.0 (unistalled 7.0 only), EQ was fine. I<br/>
agree that AOL sucks and I am only using it until I can<br/>
afford to get DSL. What compant do you think I should<br/>
use?</div>
