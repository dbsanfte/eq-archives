<div id="ygrps-yiv-673771452">Okay, here&#39;s the deal with pets:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your pet<br/>
gets a fraction of the xp if and ONLY if they make the<br/>
killing blow. You&#39;ll see a lot of higher-end necros and<br/>
mages dismiss their pets when a mob gets low on health<br/>
or starts the &quot;frantic escape&quot; mode. This is to<br/>
ensure that they get full XP for the mob.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This<br/>
really isn&#39;t something to worry about at lower levels.<br/>
I&#39;m playing a mage on Lanys. Last night I, with two<br/>
other mages and a Necro, all using pets, laid waste to<br/>
the Warrens for a good two hours and gained about 3<br/>
bubs of XP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of which, I&#39;m going to<br/>
start a new thread in just a moment about hunting<br/>
spots...</div>
