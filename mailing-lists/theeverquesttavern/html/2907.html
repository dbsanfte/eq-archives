&gt; The good news is that the skeletal excavator&#39;s you have to kill to <br/>
&gt; get the foreman to pop are found on the first floor. They are not <br/>
&gt; behind any doors, so it&#39;s just a good ol&#39; find &#39;em and whack &#39;em <br/>
&gt; event. When the foreman pops, he does a zone wide saying and <br/>
appears <br/>
&gt; towards the back on the first level, between the two skulls in the <br/>
&gt; wall. Kill him and Sir A will spawn in the same spot. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Befallen is decent. I still visit it with my 28 war once in a <br/>
while. <br/>
&gt; On the way to the 2nd level, that is when you will find much more <br/>
&gt; sks, necros, and mummies. They will swarm you. But since this quest <br/>
&gt; can be done with out going down there or through any doors, you <br/>
&gt; should be fine. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi to all. Cahlia here, 19th season wood elf druid, who is trying <br/>
&gt; &gt; desperately to level to 20 and claim my surname heheh! Oy I hate <br/>
&gt; &gt; taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyhow, I was looking up a quest yesterday and found one I am <br/>
&gt; &gt; interested in. Starts in Felwithe talking to the high elf who <br/>
&gt; stands <br/>
&gt; &gt; by the water and tells you he is troubled by his son&#39;s <br/>
&gt; disappearance, <br/>
&gt; &gt; please talk to someone else. I found that if you go to Befallen <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; kill a skeletal foreman, it will spawn Sir (something or other <br/>
&gt; starts <br/>
&gt; &gt; with an A). I got the directions, etc. He gives you a token you <br/>
&gt; take <br/>
&gt; &gt; back and give to the high elf and he gives you his daughter&#39;s <br/>
&gt; token. <br/>
&gt; &gt; A pretty cool amulet with 3AC, +3wis, +3int, +3 cha, +3Sta, and <br/>
+3 <br/>
&gt; &gt; agi I do believe. Anyhow....here&#39;s my question...can I make it in <br/>
&gt; &gt; Befallen at level 20 ok? I&#39;m scared from what I read to attempt <br/>
it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Apparently everything aggros terribly. EQAtlas says level 7-25+ <br/>
&gt; mobs, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but since they are all necros and thermagists, the damages are <br/>
much <br/>
&gt; &gt; worse than they con. I HATE dying, and I&#39;m too chicken to attempt <br/>
&gt; &gt; without some feedback. Any suggestions or stories?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
