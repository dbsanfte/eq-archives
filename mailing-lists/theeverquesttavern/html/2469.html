<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142030229">Good thing about Goons, they only leave the<br/>
compound at night. Also, if you are a &quot;dark race&quot; (iksar<br/>
not included), they will not bother you (ie. if you<br/>
can shop/bank at the OT outpost, you&#39;ll be ok). One<br/>
of the Goons&#39; last name is the same as that Bard<br/>
speed song, so you KNOW he&#39;s fast. Also, they make<br/>
rounds on the road at night, leaving the outpost,<br/>
travelling on the road, and then back-- IF they are not<br/>
agrod by pulling PCs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someday I&#39;ll get a group<br/>
together and go kill one for revenge.</div>
