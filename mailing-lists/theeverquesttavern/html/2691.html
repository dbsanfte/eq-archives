just past high hold<br/>
they have a goblin problem in the basement<br/>
you get and exp bonus<br/>
in my early 20&#39;s i wiped out 3 lvls in one night once<br/>
went there at 20, stayed till 34<br/>
ther is a bank<br/>
 bind there or the courtyard (better for those with gate for emergency evac )and shout for group<br/>
watch out for trains up into the keep<br/>
most of the guards there are corrupt so they wont help you much or will be slow<br/>
the ones in the courtyard just at the zone will though<br/>
<br/>
good luck<br/>

  Subject: [The EverQuest Tavern] Shammie Barb needs help<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I am back from a four month hiatus because of a move. Since I am back <br/>
  with the game and I have yet to find my EQ books and that notes that <br/>
  are sitll pack away somewhere, I am looking for a place to send my <br/>
  lvl 22 Shammie Barb for a good hunt. My character right now is in E. <br/>
  Commonlands. Any advice or suggestions would be helpful as I get back <br/>
  into the game. Thanks for your help.<br/>
