<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594305717">Well one of the things, rather two I have are the Howling Harpoon ( wis +5<br/>
mana+10 damage 14 (I think) delay 25 effect stun (Combat proc at lvl 40))<br/>
and Slime coated harpoon (wis +5 mana +10 Damage 10 or 12 delay 24) are good<br/>
to have both at least on the saryn server go for 100 to 200 pp apiece and<br/>
can go into either the Primary or Range slots.  I forget the rest of the<br/>
Mana/Wis enhance stuff I have I remember the harpoons mainly cause a friend<br/>
of mine had them and I got went to the bazaar and both were on sale there<br/>
and only had enough to get one or the other at 100pp apiece wound up buying<br/>
the Howling and some high level shammy with his epic  just out and out gave<br/>
me the slime coated saying I looked like I needed it more than he did.<br/>
<br/>
I also was told last night that the Cultural armor for Shammy have some nice<br/>
wis stats on it as well..  And I found this out last night<br/>

&gt; Hello Fellow Norrathians,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I am a Barbarian Shaman, on the Druzzil Ro server in my 21st season.<br/>
&gt; Im currently looking to buy WIS gear for me. Ive started to use this<br/>
&gt; server as healers and casters only. Id like to buy wis gear that can<br/>
&gt; get me up to level 50 ish or so. Even though you arent on the server<br/>
&gt; Im on. The name and stats of the items that you own or have owned<br/>
&gt; plus the estimated value of said items, would prove very helpfull. If<br/>
&gt; thou art on my server, send me a tell, to the name of Odraneol. I<br/>
&gt; also have yet to apply a surname to myself. please help in my search.<br/>
&gt; and ill always pay it forward with the newbies on my server. Im<br/>
&gt; usually bound in Greater Faydark, and I hunt in Unrest. And will<br/>
&gt; continue to do so until, i ding 30 and get my pet. please remember<br/>
&gt; this, live long and prosper.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
