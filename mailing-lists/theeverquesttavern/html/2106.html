<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125639450">Alright, your flaw here is saying that &quot;SK with<br/>
super high resist gear&quot;. That means he&#39;s got good equip<br/>
without assuming the same of the Necro. If the necro is<br/>
well equipped he can negate that factor. You&#39;d be<br/>
surprised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep in mind a necro is versatile. He can be a mana<br/>
battery, a nuker, and even a tank. If you read about that<br/>
new belt that gives casters haste, you will find a<br/>
necro detailing how he tanks... and the healers save a<br/>
lot of mana b/c of his tanking. His spells mob manage<br/>
and saves mana for clerics, and nukers. Necros are<br/>
the masters of party mana management in higher levels<br/>
(excluding mana regen that is). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s some weird<br/>
combo of his spells, his 3 life taps cycling, an FBSS<br/>
and some other stuff. I&#39;m not even sure he uses his<br/>
skel. And if you&#39;ve ever had a druid or shaman in a<br/>
group with a necro that knows what his doing, have them<br/>
Regen or Chloro the necro. Let&#39;s just say it helps a<br/>
lot. Chloro is like Clarity 2 to a Necro. =)I won&#39;t<br/>
play one and know little about Necros other than the<br/>
fact that I do research so I know what I group with...<br/>
but... Many necros never group. It&#39;s not that they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t make good groups, but they can solo yellows from<br/>
early on all the way to like 50+. Druids that are well<br/>
set can Octakite, but they can&#39;t dispatch a yellow as<br/>
easily as a Necro can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS...<br/>
also didn&#39;t say that an SK couldn&#39;t win on any given<br/>
day. But it&#39;d have to be a good SK, and very well<br/>
equipped as well as know how to take down a Necro. It&#39;s a<br/>
very specific knowledge. Different classes take<br/>
different methods to take down. It&#39;s not just a matter of<br/>
high resistances. It&#39;s knowing when to pumice, how to<br/>
target using all hotkeys when nothing shows up on the<br/>
screen and how to break fear or what to do when feared.<br/>
Etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree that skill and items you have<br/>
play a large part of it. I even mentioned the Warrior<br/>
streak and winner of that last EQ PVP competition. But<br/>
typically, there&#39;s an expectation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
