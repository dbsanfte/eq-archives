<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113727616">I forgot to add that I have to admit that people<br/>
here have been awfully nice to me amd los of people<br/>
are willing to hep. I did see some messages in red<br/>
last night on Veeshan somebody was yelling at a<br/>
newbie. When I am on UO (and I still have a lot to learn<br/>
there myself, yet) I try to help newbies.&lt;br&gt; The EQ<br/>
message boards, at leat on Yahoo, seem to be more active<br/>
than the UO ones.Only 1 UO one seems to be real<br/>
active.</div>
