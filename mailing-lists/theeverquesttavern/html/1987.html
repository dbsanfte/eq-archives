<div id="ygrps-yiv-446859605">CAN PS2 GET VELIUS AND LUCLIN??? That would be my<br/>
first question. Also, just go to Best Buy (or a related<br/>
retailer) and get a $500.00 computer on credit-- pay per<br/>
month, along with your EQ payment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as<br/>
what other games PS2 has, does that really matter?<br/>
Does anyone spend more than 10 minutes per week<br/>
playing anything other than EQ? My home computer is<br/>
basically an EQ machine-- with some minor other functions<br/>
like e-mail, internet, word processing, photo logs,<br/>
etc.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAA&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ps, PS2, X-box, gamecube??? I&#39;m done with my mario<br/>
bro.s/frogger days-- time to play a real game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xelz</div>
