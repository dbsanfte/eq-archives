<div id="ygrps-yiv-951862007">Thanks, it does. And yes, I am having fun, and I<br/>
just realized that I think we&#39;re on the same server. I<br/>
chose Drinal, for no apparent reason, although I think<br/>
I recognized it from various posts and discussions.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s a fun one -- someone learned that I was new and<br/>
gave me some stuff. One item was a pouch; when I click<br/>
on it for a description, it says &quot;Spirit Pouch.&quot; I<br/>
ran into the giver a bit later and asked her what it<br/>
is, and said she&#39;d never heard of a Spirit Pouch . .<br/>
. I thought about giving it back in case it&#39;s<br/>
something really cool, but I _am_ a rogue, you know. Had<br/>
she been a dwarf . . . Anyway, any hints on what this<br/>
is?</div>
