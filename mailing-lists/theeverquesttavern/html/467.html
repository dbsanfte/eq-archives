<b>Subject:</b> Hello everyone <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-498030462">Well, I&#39;m bored (University dorms don&#39;t open &#39;til<br/>
the 17th and I&#39;m stuck here at home with nothing to<br/>
do)...so I decided to burn a bit of time playing EQ. I<br/>
hope i won&#39;t get addicted again hehe ;) . Currently,<br/>
I&#39;m on the Lanys T&#39;vyl server as either Kanadin, lvl<br/>
6 druid or Tendail, lvl 3 necro.&lt;br&gt;Regarding ivy<br/>
legs - i don&#39;t know how much they cost, but if i still<br/>
had mine, i would sell them for at least 4k pp. It<br/>
took me well over 60 hours of gameplay to obtain them<br/>
(including 50 hours of camping greens in the OOT waiting for<br/>
Wiltin $%^%$% Windwalker to spawn).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Gilerrin<br/>
Galewind, retired ranger of the 42nd rank, Mith Marr<br/>
server&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;rudebeggar shouts, &quot;Someone gimme some money so I can buy my<br/>
spells!&quot;&lt;br&gt;You shout, &quot;It&#39;s beggars like you who have ruined<br/>
your own server, you&#39;ll not ruin mine!&quot;</div>
