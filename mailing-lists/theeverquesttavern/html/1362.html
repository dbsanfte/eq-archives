<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-382582003">Yeah i wanted to know your opinions about us<br/>
Shamans. I am a lv5 Barbarian Shaman on the Quellios<br/>
server. I think he kicks but since he has decent STR and<br/>
fairly good WIS. If u r a newbie Barbarian whatever, i<br/>
have numerous good quest i could give u that kick ass<br/>
:). Also who is a wizard? i am thinking about<br/>
starting one. &lt;br&gt;Tarelan lv5 Barbarian Shaman&lt;br&gt;Quellios<br/>
server&lt;br&gt;P.S. If u see me, give me a tell:) maybe we could<br/>
