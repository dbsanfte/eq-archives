<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271357378">Hi all. Newbie here. I have been out of the EQ<br/>
loop for a few months now due to school and work. I<br/>
was trying to play earlier today and I noticed that<br/>
DX 8.1 is now required. I downloaded this and my<br/>
comp said something about 3d? What is this and what is<br/>
the price range I am looking at? The Raven</div>
