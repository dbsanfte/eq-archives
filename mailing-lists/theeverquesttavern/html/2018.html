<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157217989">Interesting question. ^_^ Everything in EverQuest<br/>
that can be equiped is male and female. There are no<br/>
female or male only items. It keeps it fair I guess. It<br/>
would be cool if there were things that only women<br/>
could wear. It would make sense that only a woman could<br/>
wear a dress or frilly robe (well unless the guys<br/>
really wanted to wear it). Hehe. So no worries. Anything<br/>
your race and class can wear, you can wear.</div>
