<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-876325422">Thanks to all for your comments to my intelligent<br/>
thief question. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subemcs -- you&#39;re right; I<br/>
think I must have been misreading that part. The exact<br/>
quote (from Allakhazam&#39;s page): &quot;The higher value of<br/>
intelligence or wisdom is used to determine how quickly you<br/>
will learn most of your skills.&quot; I read that as level.<br/>
Oakenwulf&#39;s comment then makes more sense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shooman --<br/>
Don&#39;t worry, I can be lots more verbose than that . . .<br/>
but I&#39;m not sure I follow all of what you&#39;re saying,<br/>
simply because I haven&#39;t played the game yet. What&#39;s an<br/>
&quot;exp mob&quot;? Expert? Experience? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, maybe I<br/>
won&#39;t throw a lot of points on intelligence. Maybe ten,<br/>
just to get to 70, so I&#39;m only a bit dumber than your<br/>
average human. Anyway, thanks again.</div>
