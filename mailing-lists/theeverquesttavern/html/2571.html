<div id="ygrps-yiv-473381480">Must be your computer/graphics card. I&#39;ve never heard of that <br/>
happening and have never experienced it. Since Vah Shir don&#39;t seem to <br/>
be affected at all, must be the way your computer is processing the <br/>
new char models. Try turning them all off and see what that does, or <br/>
if they&#39;re off, turn them on and see what happens.  <br/>
<br/>
You cannot turn Vah Shir models off with Luclin (there&#39;s no other <br/>
model), so if that one&#39;s working and all others are not, must be <br/>
something there...<br/>
<br/>
You should take some screenshots of &quot;headless&quot; chars so we can see... <br/>
sounds interesting!</div>
