<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921476440">You may have seen this posted elsewhere-- i&#39;m<br/>
copying it for posting here. Lots of info-- i&#39;m not sure<br/>
the source, but PLEASE post if you can confirm/deny<br/>
any of this OR<br/>
more!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------------------------&lt;br&gt;General Notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Dwarch is serving as War<br/>
Leader; Zathrax is serving as Scout Master&lt;br&gt;2. The<br/>
first battle will be faught during &quot;The Festival&quot; (8<br/>
days after Bertoxx is summoned to NK)&lt;br&gt;3. The war<br/>
will be faught over a long period of time (weeks<br/>
perhaps), and will involve several fronts.&lt;br&gt;4. All &quot;good&quot;<br/>
cities on Antonica will be involved (Qeynos, Halas,<br/>
Rivervale, Freeport, Kaladim, Felwithe/Kelethin,<br/>
Ak&#39;anon)&lt;br&gt;5. Many Gods will be involved, including Rallos Zek,<br/>
Tunare, Bertox, Innoruuk, and others.&lt;br&gt;6. Zones will<br/>
behave differently. Be VERY cautious what spells you may<br/>
rely upon.&lt;br&gt;7. Mobs that are normally<br/>
level-restricted (Vox, Naggy) will not be for this event.&lt;br&gt;8.<br/>
There is a strong chance that both bridges and boats<br/>
will be down for portions of the war.&lt;br&gt;9. The safety<br/>
zones will be Surefall Glade, Arena, Lower Kaladim, and<br/>
Velious.&lt;br&gt;10. Bertox will have an army of &quot;planar<br/>
beings.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Planes of Karana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Bertox will be<br/>
summoned to NK&lt;br&gt;2. Gate and teleportation spells will<br/>
either (a) not work or (b) have a HIGH failure/fizzle<br/>
rate. I&#39;d be willing to bet this is spells&lt;br&gt;cast IN<br/>
The&lt;br&gt;zones, not spells teleporting you TO the zones.&lt;br&gt;3.<br/>
Ressurection will only be possible within these zones via res<br/>
stick&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Qeynos&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Generals for the defense of Qeynos include Shakar<br/>
and Wamsutta.&lt;br&gt;2. Trakanon and Bertox himself will<br/>
be assaulting the city.&lt;br&gt;3. Bertox will assault<br/>
the city after the &quot;Festival&quot; mentioned above.&lt;br&gt;4.<br/>
Antonious Bayle will lead an army to confront Bertox in<br/>
WK.&lt;br&gt;5. Kane Bayle will show up with half the bloodsabre<br/>
army in an effort to kill Antonious.&lt;br&gt;6. If Kane and<br/>
his army are killed, it will be discovered he in a<br/>
imposter and the real Kane will appear in Qeynos along<br/>
with&lt;br&gt;enough Bloodsabres to take the city over.&lt;br&gt;7.<br/>
Blackburrow Gnolls will aid Bertox.&lt;br&gt;8. Bertox is<br/>
un-killable until he hits Qeynos<br/>
Hills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Halas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Expect a visit from Lady Vox.&lt;br&gt;2. The Tribunal<br/>
will close Halas during the war (what this means I<br/>
dunnoe)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rivervale&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Expect a visit from Lord Nagafen.&lt;br&gt;2. An undead<br/>
army from Kithicor will assault Rivervale when<br/>
Innoruuk appears in Freeport.&lt;br&gt;3. The assault can only<br/>
be stopped by killing the necromancers in Kithicor<br/>
who are raising the zombies.&lt;br&gt;4. Legion of the<br/>
Little Folk will be defending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Freeport&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.<br/>
A Teir&#39;dal army will be assaulting the city from<br/>
Nektulos.&lt;br&gt;2. Innoruuk will attack the city armed with Lanys&#39;<br/>
Guardian Staff (more info?), a Dark Elf army, and the<br/>
Militia will join him.&lt;br&gt;3. Expect a visit from Lord<br/>
Nagafen if he is not routed in<br/>
Rivervale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaladim&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Lower Kaladim will be a safe zone.&lt;br&gt;2. Will be<br/>
assaulted by a level 15-30 Dark Elf army (with a few 50s<br/>
thrown in)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kelethin/Felwithe/GFay&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. The<br/>
Ring of Scale will aid in defending this area. If you<br/>
do NOT have good Ring faction, it is suggested you<br/>
get your butt&lt;br&gt;into Mistmore NOW or avoid this area<br/>
during the war.&lt;br&gt;2. Claws of Veeshan will be<br/>
assaulting this area (wyverns and drakes from CS, level<br/>
40-52). EVERYONE will be KOS to Claws&lt;br&gt;in Gfay,<br/>
regardless of your usual faction reading.&lt;br&gt;3. Orcs (level<br/>
10-50) will be assaulting from Crushbone</div>
