<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046656512">Handouts huh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well I too have died<br/>
innumerous times and lost my corpse. Nobody ever gave me<br/>
s**t!! You&#39;re supposed to work for your stuff. I have a<br/>
monk running around without his guild tunic. These<br/>
things happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, as long as people are being<br/>
generous, I have this monk on the Karana server, anyone who<br/>
wants to give me Wu&#39;s Fighting Gloves, or netted or<br/>
mesh armor, give a tell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck with your<br/>
handouts, pal. That&#39;s what the beg skill is for.</div>
