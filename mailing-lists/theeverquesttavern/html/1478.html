<b>Subject:</b> DING-- Wecome to Level 20!!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610881321">Hey all-- I made it to 20 last night, and finally<br/>
became Xela Orcbane. Ever since my first death at the<br/>
hands of a lowly Faydark Orc Pawn, I have taken up the<br/>
cause of the Faydark elves and worked at the<br/>
erradication of all orcs from Norrath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ihave a few<br/>
more things to do in Antonicus, then back home to<br/>
Kelethin, and finally I&#39;ll be off to Kunark. I&#39;ll probably<br/>
be at lvl 21 by the time I get there. BTW-- i picked<br/>
up a sweet Shiny Brass Halbeard from a named Orc in<br/>
HP. Anyone got a price on it?? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for newbie<br/>
questions -- who doesn&#39;t agree that the $10.00 isn&#39;t worth<br/>
it? With a new expansion with a new race and class<br/>
coming out by the end of the year-- man-- this game<br/>
rocks! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 20th<br/>
season&lt;br&gt;Xev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/auction WTT Home brewed ale for a tale of courage and<br/>
adventure-- send tell please!!!</div>
