<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108165080">1) Please not flame each other over personal<br/>
beliefs. Everyone sees things over certain<br/>
perspectives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) The post Storm posted was simply saying-- don&#39;t<br/>
throw stones... Hope I put that tactfully. Sorry if I<br/>
didn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) And the other things is-- Storm wasn&#39;t saying<br/>
that selling accounts isn&#39;t illegal. However, you can<br/>
and ppl do pay other characters to PL. That&#39;s not<br/>
selling an item or an account and in no way violates your<br/>
user agreement terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) I totally agree with<br/>
Oakenwulf-- accounts bought and accounts PL&#39;d have ppl that<br/>
don&#39;t really work well in groups and can make it really<br/>
rough at times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Don&#39;t believe Storm&#39;s<br/>
comments were directed toward Oak...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... again... hope I phrased that<br/>
tactfully.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic</div>
