<div id="ygrps-yiv-169757384">(I know.. I know. I&#39;ve been busy! Heh. Miss<br/>
me?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) More than just the tank&#39;s responsiblity to get<br/>
adds off healer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Many situations. Ex. Was<br/>
the guy fighting a large creature? Giants and other<br/>
large creatures cannot be mezzed. Also, there were two<br/>
pulls to the cleric. Chanter needs help with two adds.<br/>
At least buy the chanter some time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) 2<br/>
tanks? One definately should have peeled off. Secondary<br/>
tank always peels and gets what goes off to the<br/>
cleric&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Also clerics... quit healing so quickly. Unless<br/>
the mobs are hitting very quickly and the life bar<br/>
goes down too fast-- wait till tank is just a bit<br/>
above half life. By the time the spell hits, he&#39;ll be<br/>
below. Mobs almost never agro for a heal that&#39;s to<br/>
someone below half life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now granted it may take a<br/>
while for the timing...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Heck, in a group, if<br/>
I&#39;m awake enough to think-- I go and snare the peeled<br/>
mobs... then kite them around or zone them until my group<br/>
can finish off the primary one. Usually, we can take<br/>
care of adds no problem after that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Druids-- I<br/>
haven&#39;t wanted to taunt in a while but here&#39;s something<br/>
that almost never fails to make them agro to me rather<br/>
than tanks. If I do this whole combo, it&#39;ll take the<br/>
tank 2 mins with me just standing there to taunt them<br/>
off me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First snare, then dot, then stun, then<br/>
beg. Yes that&#39;s right ... beg. Often times, I&#39;ve had<br/>
that be the turning point. I&#39;m way on top usually if I<br/>
do that. =)Course, I&#39;m also autoattacking and have<br/>
almost maxed attack in every weapon class a druid<br/>
has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6) Errr... there&#39;s a LOT of ways to deal with adds.<br/>
Mezz, kite, fear, root works really well if the others<br/>
don&#39;t, Wizard area affect snare and area affect bomb<br/>
works well too, Pets work really well, multiple tanks<br/>
for multiple mobs if they peel to healer,<br/>
etc&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could go on forever on this topic as I almost<br/>
specialize in groups. I know most of what other classes can<br/>
do in groups for cool combos-- except for Shadow<br/>
Knight. I only know-- pet, fear, harm touch, dots. I know<br/>
they&#39;ve got a LOT more to them than that-- I just don&#39;t<br/>
know it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>
