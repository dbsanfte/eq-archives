<div id="ygrps-yiv-329246922">Hi! I was wondering if any of you Dark Elves use<br/>
the hiding ability to be rid of annoying players? I<br/>
would use it all the time when some one wanted to duel<br/>
me so they could laugh at my loss.All you gotta do<br/>
is run like the dickens,hide behind something and<br/>
don`t move!It`s hilarious when you see them asking<br/>
people if they saw you anywhere when your in the<br/>
room!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vanelen&lt;br&gt;Level 7 Dark Elf&lt;br&gt;Warrior</div>
