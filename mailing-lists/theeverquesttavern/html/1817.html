<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467248049">Tough situation-- here are my thoughts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.<br/>
Yours is a lesson to EVERYONE travelling through the<br/>
Kithicur forrest at night-- DON&#39;T!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Have you<br/>
thought of checking out which servers might have more<br/>
people on during the times you play?? If I&#39;m in PST and<br/>
play normally from 2-5 am, a server that&#39;s mostly<br/>
American (PST-EST) may not be as good for me as one that&#39;s<br/>
mainly European--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. You should be able to get<br/>
back up to decent armor/items/weapon fairly easily.<br/>
Non-twinked, my druid char didn&#39;t have THAT great stuff at lvl<br/>
14-- in fact, most of my cash went to spells, and at<br/>
least you don&#39;t loose THOSE when you die. If you like<br/>
the char, it&#39;s hard to give it up. I&#39;m not sure how<br/>
good Shammys are at soloing as you go up in levels.<br/>
Never had one, and don&#39;t see too many on my server, in<br/>
fact out of 80 chars in my guild, there are only 3<br/>
shammys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. As for great solo artists-- I&#39;ve heard<br/>
that NO warriors solo well after a certain level. My<br/>
experience for solo-ing is as follows: Necros are great,<br/>
especially in undead areas, Druids are increadible, BUT not<br/>
until you become a kite and port master, high teens--<br/>
you can port to good hunting locations instead of<br/>
running/boating. My mage is a surprisingly good soloist-- pets are<br/>
very handy once you learn to master using them in<br/>
conjuction with spells. Pallys are ok soloists, though only<br/>
in undead situations. The best soloist i know is a<br/>
Troll SK-- he seems to STILL be able to solo evens and<br/>
some yellows (with HT) at lvl 33. High melee stats,<br/>
natural regen, spells and pet. Evil race?? makes it more<br/>
fun to roleplay. Only real problem my friend has is<br/>
that he can&#39;t bank in most places-- BUT-- there are<br/>
still a few unique merchants he can sell to-- he can<br/>
bank in Runnyeye, and his STR is soooo high that he<br/>
can carry TONS of plat around for a long time. He was<br/>
discouraged at first, but found how many places in<br/>
S.Antonicus (close to his home) he could hunt, and then he<br/>
headed out to OT where all evil races are welcome and no<br/>
good guards are around at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just some<br/>
thoughts-- good luck!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
