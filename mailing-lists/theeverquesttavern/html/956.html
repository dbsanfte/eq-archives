<div id="ygrps-yiv-15137105">If you&#39;re level 4 i wouldnt even attempt to get<br/>
to Qeynos yet, you have to go through some nasty<br/>
zones. 10th level guy should be okey though.&lt;br&gt;North Ro<br/>
is a really good place to fight and level, you can<br/>
go from about 4 to level 14 there, than head over to<br/>
oasis to fight in orc camps. And you won&#39;t have to<br/>
leave the safety of Freeport&lt;br&gt;: )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;iridia 33<br/>
