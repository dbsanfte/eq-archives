<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677300253">Hey Kharl-- you&#39;re the master Rogue now aren&#39;t<br/>
ya? On opening day in FV server, I started a Halfman<br/>
rogue and my EQ world is forever changed. Never had a<br/>
melee before--AND FV is a great forum for roleplayers<br/>
and TRUE EQ players (ie. non-twinks). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, how<br/>
about a little advice, my brother in shadows? At lvl 12<br/>
i&#39;m sporting some mixed patchwork and Leather armor<br/>
and scored a few good weapons/items-- 2 Derv rings, a<br/>
Giant Snake fang, AND a dagger of dropping (which<br/>
doesn&#39;t proc yet). My 1HS weapon is a tarnished LS-- all<br/>
i can afford at this time, but i&#39;m hoping to get a<br/>
Fine Steel one if i can find anyone who is selling as<br/>
speaks Halfling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assume that money is tight in<br/>
FV, and high end items are not readily available (i&#39;m<br/>
the envy of Rivervale with my Dagger of Dropping)--<br/>
what does a rogue of mid teens need to be sucessful?<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armor will be the toughie-- i&#39;ve heard that banded is<br/>
the next step, but not a lot of people making it<br/>
right now, and i&#39;m down to about 2pp. (BUT-- with my<br/>
DOD I can now hunt wisps and start collecting their<br/>
illuminating stones!!!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as 1HS weapons, the only<br/>
word i&#39;ve gotten while sneaking around the Fool&#39;s Gold<br/>
is that the gnolls have crafted a Lariat that is<br/>
quick and can stun. Also, there is a menacing gnoll in<br/>
the Human are of High Pass who carries a magical<br/>
Tomahawk. These may either take quite some travelling<br/>
and/or more strength and cunning that I alone posses to<br/>
get them, but would it be worth it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just<br/>
rambling on... as the wee folk are known to<br/>
do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rumble&lt;br&gt;Discordant cutpurse of the 12th station&lt;br&gt;Dishwaser of<br/>
Fool&#39;s Gold&lt;br&gt;FV</div>
