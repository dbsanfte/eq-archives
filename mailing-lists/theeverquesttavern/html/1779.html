<div id="ygrps-yiv-652457059">Ah, Lovely language. Must have never died before?<br/>
If that&#39;s the case, you must have had good casters<br/>
to kill the critter quickly before it killed you.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;First off, sounds like none of you had a plan for that<br/>
situation (read: asking for it), and second, why you tanks<br/>
thought that you should split up your critters and kill<br/>
them quicker is beyond me.&lt;br&gt;Hey, you know what<br/>
happens when someone runs up and attacks a critter that<br/>
is whacking an unconcious tank? The critter kills<br/>
the tank, and THEN turns to kill you. NO ONE COULD<br/>
HAVE PULLED THE BAT OFF OF YOU! Short of killing it<br/>
outright.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How long have you been playing??</div>
