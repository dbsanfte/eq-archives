<div id="ygrps-yiv-816746701">HI there,&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m a druid on Quellious.&lt;br&gt;I found<br/>
that getting as many +wis items as possible early on<br/>
is quite helpful. Primarily I went to each area that<br/>
contains alot of skellies or creatures with weapons.<br/>
Saving items and selling. I kill only greens at this<br/>
point as it&#39;s the easiest to collect the weaps. Another<br/>
thing, I do this early early in the morning, usually<br/>
there isn&#39;t any other person in the area I am hunting,<br/>
so as to not take the kills away from the levels the<br/>
mobs are blue to. when I gain a couple hundred pp I go<br/>
to the EC auction at a busy point of the day and<br/>
auction for +wis items, stating my buying level. It&#39;s<br/>
amazing the number of people who are carrying around<br/>
items that they don&#39;t need or just don&#39;t want to have<br/>
as weight. I&#39;ve gotten some incredibly good deals<br/>
because people don&#39;t want to carry the item any more.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;Any way, what I guess I am trying to say is that<br/>
rather than concentrating on leveling at first I<br/>
concentrate on getting the necessary equipment for my<br/>
character. It is something that pays off. My level 21 druid<br/>
has a 164 wis now. Makes medding sheer heck, but<br/>
still worth it. &lt;br&gt;*grin* Jessica</div>
