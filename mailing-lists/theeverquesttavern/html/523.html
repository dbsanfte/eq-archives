<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183378247">Hiya Zigg, nice to meet you. Interesting question<br/>
you ask..do I consider you a murderer and plunderer.<br/>
Nah, not at all. If you prefer pvp over nonpvp that is<br/>
how you enjoy playing, and that is what the pvp<br/>
servers are for. I have made one pvp on Vallon Zek, but<br/>
she&#39;s still lvl 1 as I don&#39;t know the rules for pvp and<br/>
wanna check them out before I get to involved..hehe. Oh<br/>
I agree 100& on feeding your addiction..I get<br/>
withdrawal when I am unable to play.</div>
