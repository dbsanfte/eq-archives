<b>Subject:</b> Re: Where to hunt at 20 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-977641089">Hey there-- first off, you must post your<br/>
server!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK-- lots to do at lvl 20. Unrest is certainly a good<br/>
option, especially for pallys and clerics, though<br/>
warriors, chanters and druids/shammys (for sow mostly) are<br/>
welcome. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizzie is one of the only classes I have<br/>
not played AT all (i think wizzie, monk and SK are<br/>
only ones, and only a little as warrior and bard), so<br/>
I can&#39;t help you as far as solo spots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As<br/>
for Groups--- If your server has an active population<br/>
in Stonebrunt, that is a good place (usually a low<br/>
pop area, especially now with Luclin). Is anyone sure<br/>
on the population of Luclin zones?? Some are getting<br/>
more and more popular, and a wizzie may be a great<br/>
addition, expecially since there are no pure caster classes<br/>
in the Vah Shir kingdom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK-- here&#39;s what<br/>
you want. Get on the boat and head to Kunark-- LOIO<br/>
is the ultimate place to hunt from 20-26 and even<br/>
beyond. It is also /ooc /shout spam zone, so be prepared.<br/>
I was there just last night to get my rogue from<br/>
lvl 19 to lvl 20-- which i did easily-- on Xev. There<br/>
were about 80 people in the zone and groups galore.<br/>
Sometimes the standard &quot;20 rogue LFG&quot; doesn&#39;t work, and you<br/>
need to head to the action places -- Mills, Sarny<br/>
Fort, Gobbie Mines, etc. and see if there&#39;s room for<br/>
you. The action is fast, and unless a group is paying<br/>
close attention, they will not see your shouts. Plus,<br/>
some of us turn off the /ooc and /shout so that the<br/>
spam doesn&#39;t keep us from seeing the important battle<br/>
spam. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other places for pick up groups-- HIgh<br/>
Pass is still viable for you at lvl 20, find an orc<br/>
group near the Kith zone. Later you can go fight in<br/>
gobbie groups in High Keep. Oasis is still an option--<br/>
lots of groups there fighting orcs and the different<br/>
variety of crocs/caimen. You may be able to find groups<br/>
in South Karana or in Lake Rathe (the gnoll/undead<br/>
camp at the SK line). Aviak groups are somewhat common<br/>
in SK, and then you can graduate to Gnolls at the<br/>
spires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With my druid, I joined spires groups<br/>
early and all the gnolls were red to me. This is ok for<br/>
some classes-- i was still valuable as a buffer,<br/>
healer, part time mellee, damage shielding, and some<br/>
nuking. Wizzies have it tough though, as the reds will<br/>
resist your nukes, and make you basically ineffective. I<br/>
found this was true with my mage, but at least I had a<br/>
pet that could attack and I could case a good damage<br/>
shield. Chanters can Tash and still get spells off---<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are lots of other places, but depending on your<br/>
server, they may not be well populated. If you&#39;re looking<br/>
for easy teaming, you can get from 20-35 in Kunark in<br/>
the Lake of ill omen, Frontier Mountains and The<br/>
Overthere. Problem-- you have to take the stupid boat and<br/>
will have to leave eventually because the FV dock area<br/>
does not have all the spells and items you&#39;ll need to<br/>
keep going from 20-35. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus, you&#39;ll want to go<br/>
to other places-- dungeons and such-- for the fun of<br/>
it. Best fun I had is going to a popular zone and<br/>
send shouts to people that you want to go exploring<br/>
another, less popular zone--- you&#39;ll be surprised at the<br/>
resonse. That&#39;s how I got a group together in EC the first<br/>
time I went to Najena. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok--- NOW i&#39;m done...<br/>
hehe</div>
