<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278790309">/em dons his Trollish Shaman garb&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah...<br/>
youze bad ifn youze a barbie... Here &#39;tis in<br/>
plainspeak: Trollies good, barbies bad. Ogres otay. Dwarfies<br/>
good wit&#39; froglok jellies. Silly elfies too stringy<br/>
too be good. Gnomey persons make good snack. Halfings<br/>
too fuzzie. Me don&#39; know nuttin bout anyting in<br/>
Paineeeel, but ifn youze whackin dere enemies, dey like<br/>
youze. Now den...&lt;br&gt;Me jus&#39; need, er... no... youze<br/>
guys is gonna give me sum idees for name O dis troll<br/>
&#39;ere...&lt;br&gt;Me tinkin&#39; Grek sound good... er maybe Uzbek.. den<br/>
you guys could call me Stan.. hehehe....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/em<br/>
brushes off the Troll&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hehehe.. that&#39;s fun! Now to<br/>
translate: If you&#39;ve been hunting in the Warrens, you&#39;ve<br/>
killed kobolds. Ever notice the faction hits when you<br/>
kill one? The Heretics are one of the raises, that may<br/>
be why you are not kill-on-sight in Paineel. As for<br/>
the other part, I&#39;ve been wanting to create a Troll<br/>
Shaman, so I can put all that totemic armor I&#39;ve never<br/>
been able to sell to some use. I need a name, I have a<br/>
feeling Grek is taken.. I think I&#39;ve seen it before, but<br/>
I may be able to get Uzbek (and if you don&#39;t get<br/>
the Stan part, it&#39;s from the country Uzbekistan<br/>
(sp?)). Would be fun having a Troll named Stan, I<br/>
think.&lt;br&gt;Any other suggestions for Troll names?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai<br/>
