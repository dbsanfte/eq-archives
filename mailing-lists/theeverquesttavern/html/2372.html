<div id="ygrps-yiv-63028397">Hi low level bard (6) looking for a group to<br/>
travel from Keleithin (sp?) through the butcherblock<br/>
mountains to deliver a message in Freeport. I can sing us<br/>
fast across distance using a song that I have just<br/>
scribed. I have accidently found myself in Butcherblock,<br/>
and there are some low level monsters, but I have not<br/>
made it to the Dwarven City which has access to the<br/>
water. Also, I was hoping to do some fishing!!! Let me<br/>
know, I may stay for a while, level up and get some<br/>
crushbone belts before I travel. Also, I owe these orcs a<br/>
few casualties so I will be around. /tell Daevyd if I<br/>
am on if you are interested. Thanks all.</div>
