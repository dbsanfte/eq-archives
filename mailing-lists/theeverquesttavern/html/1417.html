norrath when i gave it to someone i though i could trust<br/>
with, but that person hasnt&lt;br&gt; replyed to any emails<br/>
lately. well at the time, a few months ago he was a lvl<br/>
20 wiz. and i want someone to find him and tell<br/>
me&lt;br&gt; what hes up to and how hes doing. he may be 30&quot;s<br/>
or even more. his name is Danorn and i dont remember<br/>
what i gave him for a&lt;br&gt; last name. if some of you<br/>
