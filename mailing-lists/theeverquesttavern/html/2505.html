<div id="ygrps-yiv-950162221">Oh sure. 54... easiest thing for me to tell you<br/>
is to look for people around that level and go group<br/>
with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t know to be perfectly honest<br/>
all the things they do but on Drinal, I know a lot of<br/>
50+ people or those getting up there. I know that<br/>
some like KC, and Velk&#39;s is a very popular place.<br/>
Cobalt Shrine seems popular for its non-named dragons as<br/>
well (b/c named ones give faction hits).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those<br/>
are all interesting places. Ppl in my guild that are<br/>
50+ I believe are Kala, Arso, Waubau, Bubila, Barrio<br/>
and a few others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also have this tendency<br/>
for our Enchanters to rise far and above the speed<br/>
that any other class goes up. So even though our<br/>
chanters are now 43-- if they are like Valayna and<br/>
Andarvi, they shall rise up about a level every few days<br/>
till they hit 50 in about two or three<br/>
months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just some general tips for the Necro on Drinal server.<br/>
Plus check out UGOD (United Guilds of Drinal). I would<br/>
also highly suggest visiting guild websites and posts.<br/>
Always good suggestions there. I go to my guild&#39;s boards<br/>
at<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/btribunal58632">http://pub73.ezboard.com/btribunal58632</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/btribunal58632&lt;/a">http://pub73.ezboard.com/btribunal58632&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Soulbonded (one of 4 Guilds in the Drinal<br/>
Alliance):&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/bsoulbonded71563">http://pub28.ezboard.com/bsoulbonded71563</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/bsoulbonded71563&lt;/a">http://pub28.ezboard.com/bsoulbonded71563&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would also highly suggest checking with your<br/>
guild. Whenever I get stumped about Exp or go into a<br/>
slump-- usually Guild or friends on my whois list are the<br/>
first to pull me out of hard spots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don&#39;t<br/>
have a guild, then I would highly suggest getting one.<br/>
I love my own guild, Tribunal of Antiquity. So I<br/>
have to suggest my own. Problem is-- we no longer have<br/>
anyone one as high as 54+ as they left to more uber<br/>
guilds. We&#39;re a good family group though. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of<br/>
them are in Guardians of the Keep so they must be<br/>
pretty decent. I would also highly recommend Soulbonded<br/>
as their guild leader rocks and their boards are<br/>
good and decent number are around 54+ so you could get<br/>
good groups easily. Probably do a few Kael raids and<br/>
PoH etc raids with them or the Drinal Alliance. All<br/>
the Drinal Alliance ppl have really good reps. White<br/>
Wind, Silver Hawks, Soul Bonded, Phoenix<br/>
Order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic of the Drinal server</div>
