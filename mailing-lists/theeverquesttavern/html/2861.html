<div id="ygrps-yiv-65674759">Actually, i am also having problems signing in. It keeps telling me that it cannot establish a connection with the server. I have found that if i try logging on around 6 in the evening, i can get on with little problem, but any other time it is jammed.<br/>
Best of luck ,           Melefanter 19 Ranger/Tribunal<br/>

yesterday with no problem. However, when I went to sign in, it just <br/>
hung. And I was not able to alt tab out of it, so I had to hard power <br/>
my system down. This problem repeated itself everytime I logged in <br/>
until I remembered to check my firewall. Once I cleared eq for <br/>
access, I was able to get in with no problem.<br/>
  However, the nasty eq disconnect me for no reason happened within <br/>
15 minutes of being in game. Had to reboot. Got back in with no <br/>
problems and played smoothly for 2 hours before I camped out.<br/>
