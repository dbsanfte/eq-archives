disapoint i did forget to use enter and was promptly put in<br/>
the prone position...except this time i had forgotten<br/>
to put money in the bank for food if such an event<br/>
occured (told myself i was&#39;nt going to forget the enter<br/>
key **rolling my eyes***) so luckily i had a sword in<br/>
the bank...warriors are weird like that. Had to kill<br/>
me some orcs and take their allowance then off to BB<br/>
and the ocean trip...then i was diconnected at the<br/>
end of the trip...logged back on in time to see us<br/>
leaving freeport so had to jump and swim back to<br/>
port....got my body found the bards guild delivered the mail<br/>
to the right bard and got a nice thankyou and that<br/>
was it no gold or exp!!! Lol i can imagine what it&#39;s<br/>
