<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727770569">Hello everyone! How has it been going? Well I have some awesome news <br/>
after all. I managed to get my loan and I&#39;ll be picking up my new <br/>
computer sometime next week. Pretty great huh? Well I am also <br/>
thinking that I will have to upgrade to Roadrunner instead of plain <br/>
ISP. (Faster connection and all that) So my friends keep your fingers <br/>
crossed that I can be back in the game in two weeks at the latest. <br/>
