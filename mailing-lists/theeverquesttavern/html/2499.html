<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804855540">As for the original question-- lvl 9 druid should<br/>
not have a problem getting a group-- you&#39;re powerful<br/>
with new spells, and are at the point where you&#39;re an<br/>
equal melee, nuker and healer, with some other great<br/>
spells too. If you want to group, go to CrushBone. You<br/>
can still fight at Orc Hill or at the CB ent in Gfay,<br/>
then go inside and get into groups. Over the course of<br/>
several days, you&#39;ll find that CB is it&#39;s own EQ<br/>
community within a community, and many of the people I<br/>
grouped with in CB have become gamelong friends.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advantages-- you can bind anywhere in the Gfay zone, so get a<br/>
bind at the orc lift, or better yet, at the zone to<br/>
CB. You&#39;re close to your guild for training and<br/>
spells, and close to merchants and the bank. People are<br/>
always giving buffs and free stuff out in the GFay zone,<br/>
you just have to put up with annoying Ubers with MAD<br/>
/auction. You will be looting CB belts and Lego pads, which<br/>
are a great source of either 1) XP (turn them into<br/>
Canloe in the Kaladim warrior&#39;s guild), or 2) Cash<br/>
(people buy CB belts for 1-2pp and Lego pads for 2-3pp<br/>
usually). You can work on the quests to get the Prayer<br/>
Cloth, which is a WIS shoulder Item. You can save poor<br/>
elven slaves and gain xp at the same time, by killing<br/>
Slavers and getting keys. You can kill annoying little<br/>
shorties like Rondo Dunfire and that little gnome in the<br/>
pit (what&#39;s his name again??). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But most of<br/>
all-- once you hit Level 14, you will have it made with<br/>
2 vital spells-- Bind Affinity (allows you to<br/>
control your destiny) and SOW. With these spells, your<br/>
damage shield, your STR buff, your heals and nukes, AND<br/>
MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BEST DRUID SPELL OF THEM ALL---<br/>
HARMONY (please master this spell and use it at orc<br/>
camps, derv camps, and in all situations where you want<br/>
to single pull), you should have no problem finding<br/>
groups... as for soloing... well, that&#39;s another<br/>
post...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of all the chars I&#39;ve had, my current favorites<br/>
are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of 40<br/>
levels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rumbl&lt;br&gt;Rogue of 23 levels</div>
