<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-925821844">Hi! I just joined this club - Not really sure how<br/>
things work here but thought I would give it a shot.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
I havent been able to play EQ since<br/>
August...SOB...because of work but I have been able to look at the<br/>
internet from time to time - going to everlore an such to<br/>
try to curb my withdrawels. Its been tuff:)- Imagine<br/>
not being able to play EQ for 3 months. heh&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Anyway - I sappose I am still pretty much of a newbie. I<br/>
have alot to learn and when I found this club thought<br/>
that it would be helpful and that I might make some<br/>
new friends too. Cool&lt;br&gt; I will be able to play<br/>
again in December - I think (hope). I have been playing<br/>
on Saryrn.&lt;br&gt; I do have a question. I have been<br/>
thinkin of making an Ogre Shaman and was wondering if I<br/>
should put all 30 points into wisdom or some into<br/>
agility also.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thank you much&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Venture<br/>
T`Asp &lt;br&gt; Necro of the 20th season on Saryrn</div>
