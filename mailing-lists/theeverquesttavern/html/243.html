<b>Subject:</b> A Night in Solusek (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-326627885">When I heard that a guildmate needed my services<br/>
in the infernal dungeon of Soluseks&#39;s Eye, I rushed<br/>
from Cazic Thule to meet him. There, we took on some<br/>
stuff and were about to kill a rare spawn when we ran<br/>
into 3 infernal goblin wizards...My group (I - a lvl<br/>
31 ranger, a lvl 33 druid, and a lvl 35 bard) were<br/>
utterly slaughtered. I walk back from Freeport (not that<br/>
far away from Sol) and get my corpse. Then, we get<br/>
ambushed by another horde of goblins - easier ones but<br/>
they were numerous, and we were forced to zone into<br/>
Nagafen&#39;s Lair. Just as we zoned into Nagafen&#39;s Lair, a<br/>
train of greater kobolds hit us. Greater kobolds are<br/>
about lvl 33-35 and double attack for 70 damage. My 2<br/>
teammates zoned back into SolA. Why didn&#39;t I zone? Because<br/>
the zone barrier had turned into OPEN SPACE - and it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t let me zone!!! So there I was, stuck in the zone<br/>
getting killed by 2 kobolds...When our group finally<br/>
regained composure (and picked up 3 more people to make a<br/>
full group), we returned to SolB to get my corpse and<br/>
to hunt greater kobs. When i zoned into SolB i<br/>
couldn&#39;t find my corpse!! It had fallen thru the world,<br/>
and i couldn&#39;t summon it. So...i spent about an hour<br/>
fighting kob, naked with a FS 2hander (borrowed from<br/>
groupmate). I petitioned a GM but none were online at the<br/>
time... Well i eventually got sick of it and logged off..</div>
