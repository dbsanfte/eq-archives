<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346730537">5) Enough of tanks, casters. The Function keys<br/>
are your friends. F8 to target nearest mob but the<br/>
best is party buttons. I always hit the key for the<br/>
tank and then hit my assist hotkey. Actually, everyone<br/>
should assist the tank. Even other tanks.. but having<br/>
two tanks allows one to peel off an taunt off healers<br/>
and other casters.&lt;br&gt;So everyone may not go after<br/>
the same mob if it&#39;s to pull off casters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6)<br/>
No mention was made of the casters composition.<br/>
Therefore it&#39;s a lot harder to say what ya&#39;ll &quot;should have<br/>
done&quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, every group makes mistakes. It&#39;s<br/>
learning from them that helps. Whenever a group member<br/>
dies or I die... I ask what I could have done.<br/>
Sometimes, I can&#39;t think of a thing... but eh<br/>
well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like a few nights ago-- breaking up the spawn in the<br/>
CC. I had 4 blues on me and my group of two monks, a<br/>
paly and a mage were busy with their own two mobs. We<br/>
had just killed the Queen and gotten pounced when we<br/>
went to clear out the room. I kited around but didn&#39;t<br/>
have snare memmed and rooted two but two blues on a<br/>
druid equates death. Especially when one broke root.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, my group finished off the others easily after I&#39;d<br/>
dragged them apart and made them easy pickings. Point<br/>
is-- sometimes you die without making a mistake. When<br/>
ya&#39;ll end up facing something big-- it<br/>
happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn&#39;t do anything wrong. If I hadn&#39;t rooted and<br/>
run around with 4 blues-- my party couldn&#39;t have<br/>
handled 6 blues (we thought there were 3 but dang the<br/>
stupid river had three velium crawlers-- or whatever<br/>
those swimmers are called-- hiding in the river. Soon<br/>
as we crossed the river-- wham!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My party<br/>
also didn&#39;t do anything wrong. They performed<br/>
admirably... and I wouldn&#39;t have gotten so many agro&#39;s if I<br/>
wasn&#39;t the only healer and healing my tanks as they went<br/>
low. But by doing that-- my tanks survived to wipe out<br/>
the room and kill the mobs one at a time as they<br/>
chased me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I almost even made it. Shortly after I<br/>
died, I heard them apologize that I&#39;d died and that the<br/>
camp was clear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7) sorry this was so long.<br/>
Again, ppl die. Lotsa roles to group. Etc.<br/>
