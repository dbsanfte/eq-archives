<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187885320">Okay all, I have set it up.  Go to the link below and join if you want<br/>
to be part of this new group :-)  Tonight, I will sign on and create a<br/>
character (had other things going on last night).  At some point (maybe<br/>
this weekend?) we can get the people needed to create a guild and get<br/>
that done...  Though, for now, if you are interested in being a part of<br/>
this, why don&#39;t we move discussion to the new group, as to not peeve off<br/>
people on this list that aren&#39;t interested *laughs*<br/>
