&gt; Well it seems that my dreams of actually playinf EQ again may <br/>
happen <br/>
&gt; a lot sooner than I had expected! I finally got the money I was <br/>
&gt; waiting for so I put my deposit down for the on-campus apartments. <br/>
It <br/>
&gt; seems that there may be an opening by the end of this month if I <br/>
want <br/>
&gt; it. (Yah like that&#39;s a question to ask me! Do I want it?! Yup you <br/>
&gt; betcha!) So keep your fingers crossed that I can actually move on <br/>
&gt; campus by the end of this month cause if I do...well...I&#39;ll be <br/>
&gt; playing by the middle of next month. *sigh* the last few weeks are <br/>
&gt; the hardest to wait for! The Raven </span></blockquote></div>
