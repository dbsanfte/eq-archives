<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085863409">I&#39;ve never heard anything about sharing exp with<br/>
a pet, but I have noticed a slower advancement with<br/>
my mage and my necro than with my other characters,<br/>
but that could be due to their races (Iksar and<br/>
Gnome, two fairly slow advancers anyway). I will try an<br/>
experiment, killing 10 mobs of the same level without pet,<br/>
and then 10 with pet and see if difference in<br/>
experience gained is there, I will report back with<br/>
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kroq Coldscale&lt;br&gt;Brood of Kotiz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gnorm<br/>
