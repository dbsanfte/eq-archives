Everquest is compatible with all versions of Windows (with the <br/>
exception of 3.11 maybe). It never changes. However, it&#39;s <br/>
incompatible with certain video cards if you have XP installed. <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s an old CD, then it&#39;s probably scratched or dirty (which can <br/>
stop a file from transfering) and you may need to buffer it. Try to <br/>
get your hands of a friend&#39;s copy of Velious if possible and copy the <br/>
file from there. Have you tried canceling the download, and then re-<br/>
loading it over? Have you tried cleaning the CD Drive and CD? <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to be some network engineer for that. :)<br/>
