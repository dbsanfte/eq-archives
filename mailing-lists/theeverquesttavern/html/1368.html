<b>Subject:</b> Taking the plunge - starting EQ tomorrow <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-867456951">Hail, fellow adventurers. The software&#39;s on its<br/>
way, and I should be ready to start playing EQ<br/>
tomorrow evening (3/13). I come from an AD&D (actually<br/>
original D&D, but who&#39;s counting) background, and for my<br/>
first character, I&#39;ve decided to play what I know best<br/>
-- a dwarf rogue (although I&#39;ll always think<br/>
&quot;thief&quot;). Anyway, a couple of questions before I get too<br/>
far: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. How do I tell what server I&#39;m on? Can<br/>
I change that (I assume not), or is it based on<br/>
your location/IP address? Are some servers better than<br/>
others? Do all the PK people play on the same<br/>
server?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Any suggestions on how best to set up my<br/>
character? Add points to Agility? Dexterity? Strength?<br/>
Intelligence -- ?! (I sort of dislike the idea that dwarves in<br/>
this world are dumb.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. One guide suggested<br/>
using skill points only for the &quot;craft skills&quot; -- my<br/>
thieving skills, in other words. Another suggested<br/>
throwing a point each at piercing and another weapon<br/>
skill. Any ideas?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Clans -- do most people join<br/>
one, or maybe wait until later in their<br/>
career?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Anything else? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks in advance.</div>
