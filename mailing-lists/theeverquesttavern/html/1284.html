<div id="ygrps-yiv-215318046">One thing to keep on mind is there is more to the<br/>
game than just level, level, level. It is called<br/>
everQUEST ya know. :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But honestly things are<br/>
pretty tough and can be boring until you get into your<br/>
mid to late 20s. At least it was for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m a<br/>
ranger 30th level on bristlebane and most of the quests<br/>
that can be done as a ranger can&#39;t even be started<br/>
until just now. :-) As a matter of fact I just<br/>
completed my first quest for the short sword of morin and<br/>
even then I had help from fellow guildmembers to<br/>
do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find it hard to do quests legit because you need<br/>
a group and most groups force you to roll for quest<br/>
items so if I get a group together to quest for<br/>
something I need I still may not end up with it even if we<br/>
complete it! Its a bummer sometimes! :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish<br/>
they would do more single character<br/>
quests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dinbien&lt;br&gt;30th Ranger&lt;br&gt;Bristlebane</div>
