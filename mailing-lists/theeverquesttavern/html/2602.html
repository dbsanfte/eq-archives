&gt; There&#39;s such a huge difference between playing a game like FF and a<br/>
&gt; game like EQ. There area differenct reasonas to get &quot;addicted,&quot; that<br/>
&gt; is, to want to play and play and play. The rewards system gets you<br/>
&gt; hooked-- it&#39;s not about &quot;beating&quot; the game, because that really can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be done. It&#39;s about that next level, those next skills or spells, the<br/>
&gt; next item, the next 10 or 100 or 1k or 10k plat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People have done crazier things than 7 hours of EQ play-- especially<br/>
&gt; when it comes to camping and raids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>7 hours is nothing, especially when raiding.  That&#39;s a pretty easy figure to<br/>
hit on an average Planes raid.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever done over 12 hours,<br/>
but I&#39;m not a Cleric and never had to do the Ragefire camp.<br/>
