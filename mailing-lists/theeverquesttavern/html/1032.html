<div id="ygrps-yiv-438823207">Well I just bought a Voodoo 3 3000 AGP, which<br/>
uses Glide. EverQuest has a Glide mode that has very<br/>
nice graphics and runs very smoothly, i&#39;ve had zero<br/>
problems with my voodoo and EQ seems to like it, so I<br/>
myself would recomment the Voodoo5 (lucky you that you<br/>
can afford it)</div>
