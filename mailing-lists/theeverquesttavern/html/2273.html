<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447671785">yes the prima&#39;s guide is good but for the best<br/>
info I would go to eqcastersrealm.com it gives you<br/>
character creation guides, playing stratigies, spell lists<br/>
and where to get them, armor lists, a few zone maps<br/>
and much more. For zone maps try eqatlas.com by far<br/>
the best place to print out maps. But the best thing<br/>
about these websites is that they are FREE!! =) Good<br/>
luck man and if you are on the Rodcet Nife server give<br/>
me a tell and I&#39;ll be glad to help you out in anyway<br/>
I can. my character is Toemas =)</div>
