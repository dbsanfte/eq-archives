<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990969442">You can learn any skill by just fighting. I<br/>
learned this around level 6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dodge is an avoidance<br/>
defensive skill. Therefore, it will automatically rise when<br/>
it is praticed in battle. Dodge goes off randomly -<br/>
it basically means you will avoid more attacks with<br/>
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are certain checks when a mob attacks<br/>
you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-The mob can hit you.&lt;br&gt;-The mob can just miss you on<br/>
his own.&lt;br&gt;-The mob can hit you, but you use your<br/>
Defense to avoid it or you Dodge/Block/Riposte. Block is<br/>
a form of Dodge that can block magical attacks, and<br/>
Riposte is like Dodging an attack and counterattacking<br/>
once at the same time. However, your Riposte can miss<br/>
or can be Riposted as well. Riposte can avoid<br/>
attacks from any direction, but for you to counterattack,<br/>
you must be facing the mob you Riposted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It<br/>
sounds confusing, but it makes more sense if you read it<br/>
over several times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, any time a mob<br/>
swings at you, your defensive skills are practiced. They<br/>
don&#39;t always go up when they are successful - my<br/>
Defense has been raised even when I&#39;ve been hit by<br/>
mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With any combat skill you learn as you level, you must<br/>
put one point in it. Just one. Your guildmaster<br/>
teaches you the basics. Then, while you practice it<br/>
during combat, the skill will go up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must warn<br/>
you that these raise very slowly, so don&#39;t expect<br/>
them to raise extremely quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, you<br/>
don&#39;t have to keep spending your points in your combat<br/>
skills. Just practice them (automatically attacking with<br/>
your fists will raise the skill points of Hand to<br/>
Hand, for instance).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for your weapons<br/>
question...it depends on certain factors. Weapons will be quite<br/>
heavy. 2 Jade Maces weigh 4.2 stones together, and<br/>
that&#39;s one of the lighter of the uber weapon<br/>
combinations. It&#39;s whether or not you can make the room for<br/>
them with light gear and weight reducing bags (or if<br/>
you&#39;re willing to take the AC hit) that determines<br/>
whether you should use them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have a good<br/>
tank in your group, the mobs shouldn&#39;t be hitting you<br/>
anyway, but rather your tank, so the AC loss wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
a big factor in this case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, as you<br/>
raise in level, you&#39;ll go on raids. These will most<br/>
likely start around level 40-45 or so with Fire Giants<br/>
in Sol B. As a monk, unless you are pulling (which<br/>
you probably will be :), you can swap out AC gear for<br/>
damage gear, provided there are good tanks taking most<br/>
of the damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or you could just get the epic<br/>
monk weapon. :) With the effect of the Celestial<br/>
Fists, you have two 9/16 weapons as your fists with<br/>
little weight. However this is a very difficult and<br/>
lengthy quest, level 50+.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC is important, but not<br/>
in all cases. Day to day, yes, it&#39;s important. But<br/>
sometimes you can modify your gear for the situation. You<br/>
will learn how to work with this as you gain levels<br/>
and equipment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51 champion of<br/>
