<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-691933420">Just letting you all know that you probably won&#39;t<br/>
see me because I have decided to leave EQ. I think<br/>
the game is fantastic and it is probably my favorite<br/>
game of all time. Meeting all sorts of people and<br/>
adventuring together is fantastic, but I just feel the game<br/>
takes up far too much time. You can&#39;t really get on for<br/>
15 minutes for a short session, you have to play for<br/>
hours at a time to succeed. Also, if you want to take a<br/>
break from the game, you fall far behind your friends<br/>
and can&#39;t hunt with them anymore. So, I&#39;ve decided to<br/>
move on and do some other things in my life ;) Don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong, I think the game is great and I wish<br/>
everyone in Norrath a fond farewell and good<br/>
luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trellan Hawksight, retired ranger of Tunare.</div>
