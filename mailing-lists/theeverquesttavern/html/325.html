<div id="ygrps-yiv-537745592">You must retrieve your corpse because all of your<br/>
equipment remains on it if you die. If you are to slow the<br/>
corpse will decay (At level 5 you get about a week to<br/>
recover it, no biggie.) It is one of the most boring and<br/>
frustrating parts of the game, but it is more realistc<br/>
=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emotes that have animations are wave, cheer, cry, frown<br/>
(Just like cry), and rude gesture (Everybody&#39;s favorite<br/>
LOL). I believe that is all there is now, but<br/>
supposedly 20+ new ones will be coming eventually.</div>
