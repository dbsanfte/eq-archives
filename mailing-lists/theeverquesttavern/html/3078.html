<div id="ygrps-yiv-286624073">The cd key is tied to the account name and password. A subscription <br/>
card or credit card won&#39;t help you get past this hurdle. If you knew <br/>
the person who sold the software, you could ask them for the name and <br/>
password. But it&#39;s doubtful you would get it and even more risky as <br/>
their information is registered as the owner of the account. Your <br/>
best bet would be to either buy the 9.99 cheapy basic EQ to get a <br/>
fresh cd key or find the new jumbo pack which contains most of the <br/>
expansions along with the basic eq game. It is supposed to retail for <br/>
29.99.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; member, but as far as I know the CD key is only for<br/>
&gt; the free month, and if it is second hand, that means<br/>
&gt; someone has already used up da free month,  go buy<br/>
&gt; yourself a subscription card or use a credit card and<br/>
&gt; that should fix the problem...  but, I might be wrong,<br/>
&gt; if anyone else knows and good tricks post  em... like<br/>
&gt; I said I could be wrong<br/>
