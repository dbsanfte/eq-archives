<b>Subject:</b> Looking for Tribunal players <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328358417">Hi everyone! I&#39;m looking for fellow Tribunal<br/>
players to chat with. I have 7 characters on the server<br/>
so you may know one of them. ^_^ I&#39;m especially<br/>
interested in talking with girls that play girl characters.<br/>
I am a girl that plays a girl and I get rather<br/>
upset when I find out the girl I&#39;ve been chatting to<br/>
for a week is a guy! *sighs* Oh well that&#39;s what I<br/>
get for playing a mostly boys game. Anyway I look<br/>
forward to hearing from all of you! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zinfandel<br/>
