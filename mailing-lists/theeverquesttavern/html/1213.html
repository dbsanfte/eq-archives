<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126309137">When I first bought the game I had the same<br/>
problem, what I noticed though was that all of the files<br/>
downloading were separate and even if it timed out at any<br/>
time, if 1 file was downloaded then you would need to<br/>
do it again. My advice would be to watch the<br/>
download, when one file has finished (you will know because<br/>
it will start downloading a file with a different<br/>
name) click on cancel and then start again. Takes some<br/>
time but it gets there in the end, never had any<br/>
troubles since as the size of the files are now so much<br/>
smaller</div>
