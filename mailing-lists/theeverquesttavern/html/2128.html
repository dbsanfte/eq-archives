<div id="ygrps-yiv-426614740">If someone gives you an item, it&#39;s a gift...&#39;nuff<br/>
said. There are quite a few genuinely good players out<br/>
there who remember how hard it was to start out and<br/>
therefore give things to non-twinked noobs. I like to give<br/>
stuff away unless I&#39;m desperate for plat...I hate<br/>
trying to sell stuff. For example, most of the bronze<br/>
armor I get in Sol B and the velium weapons I get in<br/>
velious I don&#39;t even bother selling, I plant the stuff on<br/>
rats and snakes and stuff in WFP. (Hmmm...how could a<br/>
snake wear a bronze breastplate?) I figure it&#39;s a nice<br/>
surprise for a noob. Also just about every time I go to<br/>
Freeport I buy a couple backpacks and hand them out to<br/>
non-twinks. Remember what a pain it was to only have a few<br/>
inventory slots for those rat whiskers and snake<br/>
eggs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will admit, all my characters are twinks. My boss<br/>
bought my first character almost a full set of banded.<br/>
When I created my bard I passed that on to her as well<br/>
as the whopping 30pp my warrior had on her BUT I<br/>
didn&#39;t wear the banded till lvl 5, i just got her full<br/>
leather cuz I felt banded was too much of an unfair<br/>
advantage. I&#39;ve lightened up since. That banded eventually<br/>
went to my shadow knight and then when she upgraded it<br/>
went on the rats and snakes in WFP. :o) Now that my<br/>
bard is much higher in level she can afford nicer<br/>
stuff for my alts and sure it makes life easier on<br/>
them. But I didn&#39;t start out at lvl 1 with a full suit<br/>
of FP. And sure, sometimes it irritates me a bit to<br/>
see a lvl 9 bard in full lambent (or singing steel!)<br/>
when I had to work so damn hard to get mine...but it&#39;s<br/>
a game and you&#39;re supposed to have fun. I had fun<br/>
doing the lambent quests...but if a person would rather<br/>
buy their quest armor because that is what it takes<br/>
to have fun...then more power to &#39;em. To each their<br/>
own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funnily enough, DAoC has made me some serious plat.<br/>
Several friends have quit EQ to play it and have given me<br/>
their stuff. The stuff I got from them is what I used<br/>
to twink my other characters and whatever they<br/>
couldn&#39;t use I sold or often just gave away. But some of<br/>
the better stuff I sold and now have 2kpp in the<br/>
bank...the most I have ever had at one time. (That probably<br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like much to some of you but it&#39;s quite a<br/>
bit to me). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottom line is, if ya wanna<br/>
twink, go for it. If you don&#39;t, don&#39;t. You&#39;re PAYING for<br/>
the game so you have the right to enjoy it whether it<br/>
be as a twink or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Mystii Shadowsoul&lt;br&gt;<br/>
