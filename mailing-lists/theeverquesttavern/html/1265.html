<div id="ygrps-yiv-6281761">The account, which Im kinda sorry to say, was<br/>
sold. I got 1500 and a lvl 45 cleric account for it on<br/>
the same server. I think it was a bit of a crappy<br/>
deal, but I got what I wanted and I didnt have to quit<br/>
cold turkey. The cleric account, which I lvled up to<br/>
about 47.5, is still active, and hasnt been touched<br/>
since late Nov last year. I plan on trying to sell him,<br/>
for really cheap, cuz Im completely broke right now<br/>
=/&lt;br&gt;Im hoping to get like 250, which I think is low for<br/>
a character of this lvl, fully equiped, even w/<br/>
some donals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;lates&lt;br&gt;bob d</div>
