<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596430690">&quot;. When I went to log in my comp said that I<br/>
needed to download DirectX8 so I did and did everything<br/>
that I was prompted to do; however, when I went to<br/>
play it said &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It says to DL DirectX8.. but<br/>
what it really is supposed to say (and I thought they<br/>
fixed it)... was that you need DirectX8.1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again,<br/>
go to Start-&gt; Run . Type in DXDIAG. Look to see<br/>
if you&#39;ve got 8.1. If you don&#39;t, there&#39;s your<br/>
problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I posted more detailed instructions a few posts<br/>
back if you get lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>
