<b>Subject:</b> Good day to you my friends... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377599085">Fellow adventurers...I am Garedon 2nd season<br/>
elven ranger on the Nameless server. I am new to the<br/>
world of Norrath and was inquiring if anyone would be<br/>
able to give me any advice to prolonge my survival.<br/>
Currently I am fighting in Kelethin but my bane are orc<br/>
pawns that will attack me unprovoked. Is this normal or<br/>
have I done something to anger them. I hope to fight<br/>
beside each and every one of you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Garedon&lt;br&gt;&quot;The<br/>
forest lives in the elf, just as the elf lives in the<br/>
forest.&quot;</div>
