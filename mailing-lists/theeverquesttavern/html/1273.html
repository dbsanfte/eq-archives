<div id="ygrps-yiv-853699028">All for everyone&#39;s enjoyment.. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I<br/>
have a sad tale to tell. One evening I was hunting<br/>
wooly mammoths in Everfrost plains. I was doing nicely<br/>
with one, until one of its buddies decided to help<br/>
out. So I ran, being the smart druid I am. I scraped<br/>
the mammoths off at Bandl McMarrin, he&#39;s such a great<br/>
guy. And I started to sit down to meditate near him.<br/>
Oops.. I hit the &#39;snare&#39; button, and guess who my target<br/>
is.. So I run back across the EF plains to zone at<br/>
Permafrost. Normally the ice giants don&#39;t pay any attention<br/>
to me, but being the night before a Vox raid, they<br/>
were all upset over being hunted. One respawned right<br/>
as I ran by, and then he proceeded to decimate me<br/>
with dual 114 punches, a 25 bash and stun, and another<br/>
set of punches. Ouch. Too bad Bandl hadn&#39;t been there<br/>
for that fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Druid of<br/>
