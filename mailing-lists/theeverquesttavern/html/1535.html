<b>Subject:</b> Re: Do you WANT to be a twink?(long one) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-558178238">Bit of a Rant... apologies for length--last<br/>
one:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually, you make a lot of sense and that&#39;s pretty cool. I<br/>
feel similarly to my Druid. Scraping every penny,<br/>
putting everything together. I just don&#39;t really want to<br/>
go through that again. I like role playing with my<br/>
Druid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s got a heart and a character to it. But in another<br/>
sense, I want to be able to enjoy my Bard. Watch him<br/>
grow up as if a child of the Druid. Develop and grow<br/>
without the pains and struggles from<br/>
before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Course, part of the reason why I couldn&#39;t condemn all<br/>
twinking and likewise-- though I wouldn&#39;t condemn anyone<br/>
that doesn&#39;t like twinking-- is b/c it could be done<br/>
right and done wrong. But more importantly, is how many<br/>
times a twinked character&#39;s just given me stuff I&#39;ve<br/>
needed in a group b/c he didn&#39;t need it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another<br/>
reason, is that twinked characters often make a lot of<br/>
difference in a group. I play almost exclusively by<br/>
grouping. I&#39;ve developed a knack for grouping b/c I group<br/>
from level 4 or 5 up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What annoys me is ppl<br/>
that buy accounts or twink and rely on soloing b/c<br/>
they&#39;re twink. They don&#39;t have many skills maxed, and<br/>
they don&#39;t know what to do in a group. Those twinks,<br/>
PL&#39;ers, and account buyers-- I could do without. They<br/>
don&#39;t even listen to you when you teach them how to<br/>
play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My bard&#39;s died more than 15 of my other character&#39;s<br/>
combined. It&#39;s hard playing a bard and getting down the<br/>
steps you need to do. Twisting and knowing what spells<br/>
to play when is harder for me than even Enchanters<br/>
seem. But I&#39;m getting better and better b/c I learned<br/>
early. My bard&#39;s level 9. When he hits level 16, I<br/>
suspect most of my skills will be maxed and I won&#39;t hurt<br/>
my party-- but help it if I do twink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine what it&#39;d be like if someone didn&#39;t put the pain<br/>
and the effort into figuring out the bard. EI...<br/>
never play Selo&#39;s Accelerando during a fight. Turn it<br/>
off before you get near your group if on CR, etc.<br/>
(Selo&#39;s will agro every last mob onto you).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I plan<br/>
on putting hard work and sweat and imagination into<br/>
every character I have. B/c of that, I won&#39;t worry if I<br/>
give them the occasional hand-me-down. A dead bard<br/>
does no group member any good. LOL. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out (last post on this subject as well. And kudo&#39;s to<br/>
ya Kharlisht cause you do make a lot of sense. Glad<br/>
you posted your opinion-- though it doesn&#39;t change<br/>
mine. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic of<br/>
Drinal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... oh.. and I do hate beggars too. But as a Druid,<br/>
you end up biting the bullet and dealing a lot. Only<br/>
time I say no are &lt;br&gt;1) I&#39;m oom&lt;br&gt;2) In a group and<br/>
my group needs my mana more than joe smith over<br/>
there...&lt;br&gt;3) The guy&#39;s back for his 3rd round of buffs/heals.<br/>
Enough already. Quit coming back to me or tracking me<br/>
down just for free buffs/heals. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re<br/>
expecting me to heal ya constantly so you can level-- quit<br/>
taking on yellows solo and group already. (This last one<br/>
is a sour point with me. Those types usually also<br/>
train to me as well. Ugggg...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=)</div>
