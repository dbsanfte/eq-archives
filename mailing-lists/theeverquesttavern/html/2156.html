<div id="ygrps-yiv-758908336">The range on most servers for SoM is 100pp to<br/>
200pp. 200pp is common on Xev, but you can hold out--<br/>
higher levels who get better will dump them for 100pp.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lots of great robes for chanters. Runed circlet for<br/>
the head (I upgraded from Savant&#39;s camp) is decent<br/>
for mid levels. I use a Walrus tooth that i bought,<br/>
which has a nice STR buff for carryig all my loot. You<br/>
need to make or buy jewlry-- lots of INT and CHA<br/>
jewelry out there for the fingers, wrists, ears, neck and<br/>
face. None of that boorish armor for me, i want to look<br/>
good... mezmerizing and enchanting!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For 150pp you<br/>
could buy some good chanter items-- quest the stien and<br/>
keep the pp!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mandir&lt;br&gt;Convincer of the 17th<br/>
