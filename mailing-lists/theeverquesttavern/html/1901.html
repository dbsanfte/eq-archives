<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092607434">The number 1 fastest way to quickley level is by<br/>
having a high level friend(druid works best) pl you. But<br/>
if you cant get anyone to pl you then you have to<br/>
hunt stuff thats good exp. If I knew what level you<br/>
were I could tell ya were to hunt. You will get more<br/>
exp if you solo rather than grouping. But soloing =<br/>
more down time. You should try to kill more<br/>
white/yellow cons and less blue cons.</div>
