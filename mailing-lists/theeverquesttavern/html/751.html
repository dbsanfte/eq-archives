<div id="ygrps-yiv-648741414">totally with you on this one... i have been<br/>
begged to more times I care to remember. I do roleplay<br/>
50% of the time so sometimes i do give stuff or a<br/>
litle money, but only when playing a cleric, enchanter<br/>
or mage. I refuse to give anything while playing a<br/>
dark elf... &quot;A proud Teir&#39;Dall does not need to beg..&quot;<br/>
I do howerver go out of my way to help newbies esp.<br/>
those who are really new. (100 corpses in the area is a<br/>
tip off). i help them getting items or doing quests<br/>
or telling them about it. Or I show them where to<br/>
hunt in Nektulos. i once given 10 tiny daggers to a<br/>
lvl 1 enchanter in Qeynos. The where the last I had<br/>
and I was on my way to Odus anyhow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However<br/>
most anoying are those who beg... then when you say<br/>
you don&#39;t give then anything keep asking why not? and<br/>
finally shout through the area that you&#39;re a<br/>
jerk...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;just my two copper...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(haven&#39;t played for 3<br/>
weeks!!! aaargh I&#39;m going mad! stupid SIMS.. sooooo<br/>
adictive)</div>
