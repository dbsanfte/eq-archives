<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265621171">Yep, there are plenty of rude folks out<br/>
there...in real life, so why would the game be any<br/>
different? ;) However, in general, I&#39;ve found the game to be<br/>
very rewarding and fun. I do think there should be<br/>
some limit on how many OOC&#39;s, SHOUTS, and AUCTIONS one<br/>
can send per hour. Of course my favorite is the<br/>
guy/gal begging for a SOW or a CLARITY, there are like 3<br/>
people in the zone, none of which are DRUIDS or<br/>
ENCHANTERS! Hello.../who is our friend! =) I normally will<br/>
send ONE OOC for Breeze or Clarity, and ALWAYS donate.<br/>
If I don&#39;t get any response, I send a polite tell to<br/>
a high level for Clarity...just one. If I don&#39;t get<br/>
a response, I simply try the next zone.<br/>
