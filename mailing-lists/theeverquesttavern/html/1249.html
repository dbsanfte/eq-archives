<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368026247">Now personally, I don&#39;t know which way I stand on<br/>
this particular issue but as far as I know-- it&#39;s not<br/>
because of Auctioning off characters and items online<br/>
that has evoked this policy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s b/c of two<br/>
fold reasons. 1) It&#39;d be something that could cause<br/>
GM&#39;s endless work. A lot of ppl want to move servers<br/>
every month and it&#39;d generate a LOT of extra work. I<br/>
would hazard to guess there&#39;s at least a couple hundred<br/>
people a month. 2) There would be characters that would<br/>
jump from one server to another to twink friends. Ever<br/>
hear of anyone complain about such and such a Power<br/>
guild ruining a new server? Usually this is the heart<br/>
of the argument.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to say, there are<br/>
probably even more reasons why this policy is in place. I<br/>
agree that it is sometimes unfair-- dependent on RL<br/>
situations. However, it&#39;s not totally unfair. There are<br/>
reasons behind it. And again, as I understand it-- it has<br/>
nothing to do with said, &quot;Illegal activitites&quot;. It&#39;s an<br/>
attempt to protect the other players that could be<br/>
adversely affected by the addition of a &quot;Power&quot; character.<br/>
Particularly if seen as an addition to a &quot;Power Guild&quot;.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only recommendation I have is to try to appeal<br/>
for an exception. Gluck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FatedHue/shooman<br/>
out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... Personal note. I have no troubles with that.<br/>
Guilds are nice b/c ya&#39;ll are friends. Power Guilds are<br/>
nice b/c I group a lot and get benefits from them<br/>
constantly. But I know a lot of friends whome hate it b/c<br/>
there are guilds that just help twink. This creates<br/>
characters that don&#39;t learn how to actually play the game,<br/>
how to group properly, and ends up in a lot of<br/>
deaths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t mind twinking if you know your character.<br/>
But learn what to do when and how to group. Make sure<br/>
your skills are up. Many examples where characters<br/>
hadn&#39;t grouped and didn&#39;t know the benefits of taunt. Or<br/>
how many times have characters not known to attack<br/>
the mezzed Enchanters pet. Learn from others of your<br/>
class. Learn root vs snare. Etc. LEARN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry.<br/>
Personal fustrations getting out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
