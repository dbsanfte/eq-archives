  &quot;City with the stone walls . . . &quot;  I assume you mean in Greater Fay? <br/>
  That would be Kelethin.  Yes, they&#39;ll skin you alive even more <br/>
  quickly than the Wood Elves.  So will the Dwarves of Kaladim, if <br/>
  that&#39;s the place you&#39;re thinking of (but the entrance to Kaladim is <br/>
  in the next zone over, Butcherblock Mountains).<br/>
<br/>
  My advice is just to be a Dark Elf SK and kill everything in sight, <br/>
  except your own people and maybe Ogre and Trolls.  Relish your evil, <br/>
  revel in it.  You can always create an alt someday and go exploring <br/>
  the good zones you&#39;ve never gotten to see.<br/>

  &gt; Also that city with the stone walls, do the guards attack me on <br/>

  &gt; there? I&#39;m afraid of trying to find out.<br/>
