<div id="ygrps-yiv-800951675">Hello members, I am doing a research paper on video game addictions <br/>
and I was hoping you could help me with some feedback. What I am <br/>
looking for is the craziest things you ever did that can be directly <br/>
related to this game. I can tell you I have never played this game, <br/>
but I have a few friends that did, and some of the things they say <br/>
they did was call out from work sick, and play the game seven hours <br/>
in one setting! These are the things I am looking for and my friend <br/>
suggested that if they did it, then there are countless others out <br/>
there that have done even more. I am also looking into how you got <br/>
hooked on playing this game. Did someone lend you a copy? Play it <br/>
over a friend&#39;s house? Also, please note that I am not bashing <br/>
anybody here - I am a video game addict myself. I admit I love to <br/>
play them, and spent countless days playing Final Fantasy into the <br/>
early hours of the morning. I hope you guys and girls can help me <br/>
out. Thanks again!</div>
