<div id="ygrps-yiv-825590493">Ok here are a few things that may or may not<br/>
help~ I remeber tryimg to talk a freind through set up<br/>
not to long ago & he had this exact problem. After<br/>
going through everything step by step we found out that<br/>
he never checked a perferred method of payment.<br/>
Sounds funny but he said after downloading & doing his<br/>
account/logon info it shot him back to the start menu~ so he<br/>
kept hit play everquest & nothing. Wish I were in from<br/>
of my home pc to help but Im unfortunatly at work.<br/>
Email me if u like & I will try to further help u<br/>
out!&lt;br&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:billy.scott@...">billy.scott@...</a></div>
