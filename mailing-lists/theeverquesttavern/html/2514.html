<div id="ygrps-yiv-200274059">Actually, the 3 month thing is how long they<br/>
guarantee you they will hold on to your character info, but<br/>
as far as I know there have been no character wipes<br/>
except for those of really low lvls. I know of people<br/>
being away from game for up to 9 months and their<br/>
characters still be available.</div>
