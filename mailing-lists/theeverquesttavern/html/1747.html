<b>Subject:</b> Re: thinking about EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-228902210">Greetings &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I too played AC (and UO too)<br/>
until I discovered EQ. It is no contest imho - EQ blows<br/>
them both away. I find EQ alot more realistic - took<br/>
me awhile to figure out how to make some decent<br/>
coin. Not like AC where money was falling everywhere.<br/>
Time and patience and I think you will have alot of<br/>
fun EQ. The only thing I miss in AC is the tuning<br/>
stones - here you need to find a caster to bind.</div>
