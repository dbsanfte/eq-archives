<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509453494">I LOVE ramblings... here&#39;s a little from<br/>
me....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You did not mention really the Pallys or SKs. I love<br/>
grouping with Pallys. The tank well, great against undead,<br/>
but most importantly they have Lay on Hands (which<br/>
has saved my life more than once) AND can heal<br/>
themselves after battles (which lowers downtime and saves<br/>
the healer&#39;s mana). SKs are nice because they tank<br/>
well AND can summon a pet. (one of my chars is a mage,<br/>
and I know full well the value of a good pet. The pet<br/>
can tank when you need a break, the pet can taunt so<br/>
you can run if needed, and that extra damage can mean<br/>
the difference in a tough battle). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I assume<br/>
you didn&#39;t mention Clerics because that&#39;s a<br/>
no-brainer. They&#39;re great and welcome at any time.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT--if a cleric isn&#39;t available, a druid will serve as a<br/>
healer in a pinch. I&#39;ve been in groups as a druid where<br/>
i am the primary healer. Then, the next day, i&#39;ll<br/>
be a nuker, or even one of the tanks. Druids are my<br/>
fav class because you aren&#39;t typcast -- Clerics are<br/>
healers, Pallys are tanks, Shammys are buffer/debuffers,<br/>
Wizzies are Nukers, etc. . We are the best solo artists,<br/>
and we are the jack of all trades in a group. In an<br/>
outdoor group especially, we make the best pullers.<br/>
(Track, find a great mob, snare and DOT it, and lead it<br/>
by a chain back to your group)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone has<br/>
something to say about the best classes at higher levels.<br/>
EVERY class has benefits and burdens. What YOU like<br/>
about the game will probably determine which class you<br/>
like at a higher level. Unfortunately, many people I<br/>
know pick a race/class combo that sounds fun, gets<br/>
caught up in leveling that character up, then gets stuck<br/>
in a HELL level and realizes that they really don&#39;t<br/>
like playing that char anymore. I LOVE the mage class.<br/>
Many higher levels complain about the limitations and<br/>
abilities of the mage at higher levels. I love the fact<br/>
that, at least in the mid 20s, I can solo AND group<br/>
very effectively. What will it be like at lvl 40? I&#39;m<br/>
not sure. But i think i&#39;ll still be happy if &#39;ole<br/>
Jobabaner is by my side and I&#39;m slamming baddies with my<br/>
potent nukes. Oh, yeah-- don&#39;t i also get the malaise<br/>
line of spells too?? WOOT!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My mains are a mage<br/>
and a druid. Neither are melee classes (although I<br/>
sometimes will tank with my druid). I love the complexity<br/>
of choosing what spell will be effective in what<br/>
situation, given my mana limitations. BUT-- I sometimes wish<br/>
i could tank. Mayhap i&#39;ll creat a<br/>
warrior/monk/pally/sk soon??? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rambling on and on and on and on<br/>
and on and on....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
