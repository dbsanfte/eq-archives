<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238046838">Ok well Raven - I alos remembered last night i want to know what Memory Chips you have! This is a trick you need at least 2 128 SDRAM Memory cards so it has enough emory and 200MHz to run everquest is WAY under the minimum requirement. Pen 2 processor shoulod be enough. I suggest you get Windows ME and to find out exatcly how many MHz you have re-boot your computer the screen that shows up first wll so somewhere at the top or near it 200MHz or whatever amount you have. Before buying anything i would like to know a lot of things about your computer because I had the same problem bro! I fixed it not with a Vid Card and your Vid card should work cuz myne is also a piece of junk. The problem was the memory and I had no clue. 200MHz if it&#39;s true it is no wonder you can&#39;t run EQ. E-Mail it to me.! - Ziward <br/>
