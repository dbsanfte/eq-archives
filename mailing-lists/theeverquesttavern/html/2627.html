<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306798245">Well I contacted EQ support with all of my info and they said that <br/>
they do not support some of the systems that I have. Sooo, I guess <br/>
this means that I have to upgrade. Oh well. I know where I can get a <br/>
decent computer for my old one as they buy old systems. I am also <br/>
keeping my hard drive so I don&#39;t have to back-up and reinstall <br/>
everything. I have a friend that is going to give me a ride to work <br/>
tonight and we are going to stop at the comp shop to check it out. <br/>
I&#39;ll let ya&#39;ll know how that goes and how soon I can be playing again <br/>
ok? The Raven  P.S. Ya I did have a few programs running when I did <br/>
the dxdiag. I think there were like 6? 8?</div>
