<b>Subject:</b> Leveling for Human Druid @ 9 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-105050110">Hello,&lt;br&gt;Everyone was so helpful for the lvl 20,<br/>
could some one help me. I am a human druid lvl 9 and am<br/>
wondering where to go, without getting my buns toasted.<br/>
Currently I am in the Kaladim area and am soloing. Right<br/>
now no-one wants to group or lvl with me, which is<br/>
okay, I am still new and my magic isn&#39;t that powerful<br/>
yet. Where in Norath or on the moon may I go to have<br/>
some fun and adventure without getting killed every 5<br/>
minutes?&lt;br&gt;Appreciate in advance all the help I can get.&lt;br&gt;Cat</div>
