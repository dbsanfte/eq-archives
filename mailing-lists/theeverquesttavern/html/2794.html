<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889511822">point taken<br/>
<br/>
so it wouldn&#39;t qualify as scientific method<br/>
i agree<br/>
and i agree that its misleading for the school to qualify it as a scientific study sense witchcraft, consisting mostly of ritual seems (imho)mainly esoteric in nature.  i would also note that this type of school is nothing new so their claim of novelty would false also.<br/>
<br/>
i do believe (imo) that religion is not required to practice witchcraft. altough it might possibly be like having a ham sandwitch with out mayo (just not as entertaining)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
on morality<br/>
i apologize for my quick and unqualified note there<br/>
of course there is morality in dogma, and ethics as well, although its important to note that the agenda behind dogma is not solely for this purpose<br/>
lessons in morality and ethics can be found in works of undisputed fiction as well. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thank you for being so thoughtful in your reply<br/>
<br/>
so....what does that little announcment have to do with everquest anyway?<br/>

  Ok, this is good... Nothing like a bit of intelligent<br/>
  debate.  I was incorrect in my beginning analogy, My<br/>
  main beef was with the claims the school made as to<br/>
  following &quot;scientific method&quot; and turning around and<br/>
  handing out certification in astrology.  Oh, PS just<br/>
  because something is widely practiced does not deem it<br/>
  &quot;science&quot;.  Science is the study of that which may be<br/>
  measured, catalogued, REPRODUCED, and not subject to<br/>
  change.  1+1 will always be 2 ect.  And, I was stating<br/>
  an OPINION not a fact.  I made no claims to<br/>
  omnipotence. I am a student of world religions not a<br/>
  professor =P<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks for giving me something to write about tho.<br/>

  &gt; untrue<br/>
  &gt; witchcraft is a practice not a religion<br/>
  &gt; it has been found in various forms in all relgions<br/>
  &gt; so it is a science then<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; and there is morality with out religion<br/>
  &gt; dogma is not morality<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   In my opinion (key phrase) witchcraft without<br/>
  &gt;   religious backing is like morality without<br/>
  &gt; religious<br/>
  &gt;   backing.  Without any provocation or compelling<br/>
  &gt; force<br/>
  &gt;   behind it, it is little more than science and<br/>
  &gt; should<br/>
  &gt;   not be labled &quot;witchcraft&quot;.  And, on another note,<br/>
  &gt;   certification in astrology, other than a<br/>
  &gt; historical<br/>
  &gt;   study CANNOT be deemed scientific without results<br/>
  &gt;   which may be CONSISTANTLY reproduced.  Use the<br/>
  &gt; same<br/>
  &gt;   formula and you will get the same results every<br/>
  &gt; time. <br/>
  &gt;   Let it be known, I try to offend no one, and my<br/>
  &gt;   statements are mearly speculation.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;     Psyko =P peace out<br/>

  &gt;   &gt; Witches school casts spell on Alps<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Tue Oct 8,10:23 PM ET<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; By Julia Ferguson <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; KLAGENFURT, Austria (Reuters) - You won&#39;t learn<br/>
  &gt; how<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; to fly a <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; broomstick or cast spells with the flick of a<br/>
  &gt; wand,<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; but a potent dose <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; of grit and study will turn you into a witch,<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; promises Europe&#39;s first <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; School of Witchcraft. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; The school in the southern Austrian city of<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Klagenfurt might sound <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; hocus-pocus, but those looking to emulate<br/>
  &gt; fictional<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; young wizard <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Harry Potter (news - web sites) will be a mite<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; disappointed: the <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; curriculum is downright scientific, and eye of<br/>
  &gt; newt<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; is nowhere to be <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; seen. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Headmaster Andreas Starchel, who prefers to be<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; called by his druid <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; name Danaketh, said he established the school to<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; demystify witchcraft <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; by explaining phenomena using scientific methods<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; from physics, <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; chemistry, and biology. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &quot;Everything that is taught and learned at our<br/>
  &gt; school<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; can be proven <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; using natural scientific and psychological<br/>
  &gt; methods,&quot;<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; he told Reuters <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; during a training session in the woods. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &quot;We teach everything needed to become a real<br/>
  &gt; witch<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; in the historical <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; sense -- that is to have an all-encompassing<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; knowledge of nature and <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; a highly developed sense of intuition. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &quot;Being a witch is not inborn. Anyone can learn<br/>
  &gt; to<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; become one,&quot; he <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; added. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Practitioners of witchcraft focus on the good in<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; life and the spirit, <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; and reject any connection with the devil,<br/>
  &gt; Starchel<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; said. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Since their beliefs date back to ancient times<br/>
  &gt; well<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; before the birth <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; of Jesus, witchcraft has no bond with the<br/>
  &gt; Christian<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; embodiment of <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; evil. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &quot;Witchcraft has got absolutely nothing to do<br/>
  &gt; with<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; the folklore image <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; of evil witches with green faces and warts on<br/>
  &gt; their<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; nose. It&#39;s about <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; becoming a rounded person who lives in harmony<br/>
  &gt; with<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; nature,&quot; said the <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; goatee-bearded druid. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; NO HOCUS-POCUS NOR HUNKUM BUNKUM <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; The headmaster stressed that his school,<br/>
  &gt; established<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; in 1998 for <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; wannabe witches and druids of 18 years and<br/>
  &gt; above,<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; has no ties with <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; religious organisations nor follows any esoteric<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; movement. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; The syllabus originally lasted three years but<br/>
  &gt; has<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; now been revised <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; to a more flexible form to suit students&#39; busy<br/>
  &gt; time<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; schedules. In a <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; sign of the times, it teaches courses over the<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Internet as most of <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; its students live outside Austria. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; A student graduates with a venefica or veneficus<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; (from the Latin for <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; witch/druid) certificate after passing written<br/>
  &gt; exams<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; in seven modules <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; and submitting a final thesis. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; The first module focuses on awakening intuition,<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; specifically on how <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; to find sources of energy in nature and how to<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; channel it. Other <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; modules are astronomy, astrology, botany,<br/>
  &gt; holistic<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; healing and ritual <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; magic. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Curriculum information on the school website<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; www.hexen-schule.de <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; shows there are no modules like the Defence<br/>
  &gt; Against<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; the Dark Arts <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; class which Harry Potter had to take in the<br/>
  &gt; Hogwarts<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; School of <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &quot;Some wannabe witches and druids are turned off<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; enrolling with us <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; when we tell them that our aim is to demystify<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; witchcraft,&quot; said <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Starchel, who is an information technology<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; specialist by profession. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &quot;People do approach us hoping to learn how to<br/>
  &gt; fly on<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; a broomstick. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Then we have to disappoint them and explain that<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; it&#39;s much more <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; important to let the spirit fly -- to be able to<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; combine intellect <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; with the soul.&quot; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; The school has received a huge fillip from the<br/>
  &gt; Harry<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Potter books by <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; J.K. Rowling (news - web sites) and television<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; series such as Sabrina <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; the Teenage Witch. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &quot;We actually had kids phoning up asking whether<br/>
  &gt; they<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; could ditch <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; their school and enrol with us,&quot; Starchel said. <br/>
