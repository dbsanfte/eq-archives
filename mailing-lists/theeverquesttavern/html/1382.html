<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593282644">Well, I actually do think that intelligence is<br/>
important for a rogue, but that&#39;s another story. . . Neat<br/>
backstory for your character; maybe add something about<br/>
searching for your father to convince him of the error of<br/>
his ways, so your mother could return from the plane<br/>
of Air (if one returns from such places; remember,<br/>
I&#39;ve very new here!)? Or, he has discovered your<br/>
existence, and you&#39;re on the run from him? I&#39;m always<br/>
looking for reasons why people go adventuring. Keep us<br/>
posted.</div>
