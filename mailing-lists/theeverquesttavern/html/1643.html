<b>Subject:</b> Where does all that plat come from? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274763610">Greetings! My main character is a paladin of the<br/>
12th season. Both arms and armor need improvement, yet<br/>
the costs of both are heavy. While running through<br/>
EC, I hear prices in the thousands, but I have barely<br/>
a hundred plat after all this time. Where do people<br/>
get all that plat? Are there places I should be going<br/>
that I haven&#39;t been? Any advice would be much<br/>
appreciated. Fair Journeys!&lt;br&gt;(Written on behalf of Naeani,<br/>
