<div id="ygrps-yiv-339164362">E3: Ultima Online 2 becomes Origin &lt;br&gt;Origin<br/>
previewed an early version of the sequel to Ultima Online<br/>
behind closed doors at E3. It is hugely different to its<br/>
predecessor, as you will see &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some confusion at first.<br/>
Since Electronic Arts is publishing all products under<br/>
its own name, and since Ultima Online 2 is so very<br/>
different from the original UO there has been a name<br/>
change. The game is now called Ultima Worlds Online:<br/>
Origin.&lt;br&gt;The first very obvious difference from UO is that<br/>
Origin is entirely 3D. The characters that inhabit the<br/>
terrific 3D worlds are inspired by Todd McFarlane, creator<br/>
of Spawn, and feature a range of fantastic looking<br/>
creatures in addition to stylish and sexy humanoid<br/>
characters. Just like with the original UO, it&#39;s possible to<br/>
dress your character how you like, and train them in<br/>
the skills you find most entertaining and<br/>
cool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To keep things safe for beginners, and as a new<br/>
approach to appeal to the UO pros out there, Origin<br/>
incorporates two continents. One is for character development<br/>
and socialising alone, there are no Player Killers<br/>
here - it&#39;s not allowed. When you feel good and ready<br/>
to go into battle, if this is your style of play,<br/>
you can venture into the other continent and reap<br/>
your rewards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Origin will ship sometime next<br/>
year, but no date has been set. It&#39;s looking great, but<br/>
it could be UO players will prefer to continue with<br/>
what they already know and love. This sequel is mostly<br/>
for a new breed of online adventurers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; So<br/>
what you guys n galls think? EQ beater? Should Verant<br/>
ruch to it to make EQ2? Is there life after EQ? Am I a<br/>
rambling baboon?</div>
