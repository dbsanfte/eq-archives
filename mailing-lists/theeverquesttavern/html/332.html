<div id="ygrps-yiv-116646000">Workin on Quests.&lt;br&gt;as far as ive seen the<br/>
quests are very high lvl, i can barely solo most of the<br/>
stuff involved with the lambent (bard armor) infact i<br/>
needed a a friend or a small group to do it. I have<br/>
collected 18 of the 21 items for all the quests, and i am<br/>
only missing the boots and bp (wich there are only<br/>
about 5 lambent bps on the server so far) and spent<br/>
more than 1000pp on jems. I am almost done with it, if<br/>
i can only get a group together to help me in<br/>
mistmoore....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor, 42 Bard, Mintrel of Norrath on the<br/>
Mithaniel Marr server&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;p.s. i think the shaman quests<br/>
are in lake rathe (green plate) yes rangers...shamans<br/>
get the green stuff before you do =P hehehehe</div>
