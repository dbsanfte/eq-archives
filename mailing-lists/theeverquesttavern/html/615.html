<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428847203">Another thing is that you will likely perpetually<br/>
oom (out of mana) and medding during some of the<br/>
fighting. You MUST med bacause your mana is vital to the<br/>
group, stand up, DoT if needed or nuke, sit back down<br/>
and med. It&#39;s hard to keep track of a pet when<br/>
medding. I just really prefer going petless in cazic.</div>
