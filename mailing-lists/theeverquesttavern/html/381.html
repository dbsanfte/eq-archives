<div id="ygrps-yiv-124494204">IMO Ranger is a good class to start to learn,<br/>
easy to track kills and dangers, forage for food, and<br/>
learn to use spells at level 9, not to mention a<br/>
reasonable fighter. A good class to learn EQ<br/>
with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selecting a race that can see in the dark helps too, but<br/>
beetle eyes are good enough anyway, which you will<br/>
probably be able to get from beetle kills at<br/>
lvl3/4.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once again IMO, if you want a good time playing, even<br/>
though the class has its problems (worse than most<br/>
others), the Rogue is the best for<br/>
Roleplaying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knave, level 10 Rogue&lt;br&gt;The Tribunal</div>
