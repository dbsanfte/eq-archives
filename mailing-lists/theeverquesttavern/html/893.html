<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-205345918">I just joined this club. I&#39;m pretty new to<br/>
Everquest. My main character is a level 3 mage with all the<br/>
level 1 spells. I also have a level 2 necro but I cant<br/>
get to my guild hall cuase the hallway there is too<br/>
dark... my necro is on the PvP-teams server and if any<br/>
other fellow necro could help me on that server, your<br/>
help would be greatly appreciated. And i could also<br/>
use some cash for some spells. Well, I&#39;ll be a<br/>
regular member here. SEE YA!!!! over and out.</div>
