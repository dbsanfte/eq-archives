<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-149915210">I finally made lvl 31. I was lvl 29 5 X and lvl<br/>
30 3 X. I hate dieing when I don&#39;t have a safety<br/>
bubble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now I&#39;ve been fighting in Cazic-Thule. Very rough<br/>
place, lots and lots of trains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone else did<br/>
Cazic? If so got any advise? I&#39;ve discovered that tanks<br/>
seem to do much better in dungens than casters. So I<br/>
try to get in a group with at least 2 meat shields<br/>
=). Been camping Tea and aschion (sp)and I still get<br/>
lost in the maze!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thats all the news I have for<br/>
now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Aeday Femmefatel &lt;The Dark Lords&gt;&lt;br&gt;lvl 31 DE<br/>
