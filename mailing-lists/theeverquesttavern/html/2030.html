<div id="ygrps-yiv-128458211">At level 8-- if you&#39;re still in/near Gfay, here&#39;s<br/>
a good way to make some money on established<br/>
servers (ie. NOT FV server).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kill BATS-- sell<br/>
stacks of bat wings to druids, chanters, etc who can<br/>
cast Lev spell. Higher level chars will pay 5pp for a<br/>
stack of batwings (that&#39;s what I pay, at<br/>
least).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kill Skellys-- sell stacks of bonechips to necros and<br/>
SKs. Not sure how much they sell for, but I&#39;d assume<br/>
it&#39;s close to the bat wing price. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunt Skellys<br/>
in any Faydwer zone. Even if the skellys don&#39;t give<br/>
xp anymore (ie. decayed), kill any that you see<br/>
holding a staff or shield. Cracked staffs sell to<br/>
merchants for 1pp, which is good for your level-- i think<br/>
shields sell for about the same too. Dwarf skellys in BB<br/>
are higher level and may still give xp. Regular<br/>
skellys may be too high for you just yet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HUNT<br/>
ORCS!! Go fight orcs on orc hill, near the CB zone, or<br/>
in CB. The drop lots of stuff you can sell, so make<br/>
sure you have extra bags. Auction off all CB belts and<br/>
pads. Belts can be sold for 1 or 2pp each, pads for<br/>
2-4pp each, depending on server, time of day and<br/>
market. I had a twinked guy buy 5 pads from me for 5pp<br/>
each. I lvled my chanter up in CB from lvl 9 to 12 and<br/>
made lots of money off the mobs there-- not many<br/>
chanters there, so explain to your groups how they can<br/>
best use you. (Also, I actually turned in the belts<br/>
and pads for the quest, and still made some money by<br/>
selling the misc. items you get for the quest).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you hit your low teens, the best bet is to do one<br/>
of the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NRo/SRo-- Derv camps--<br/>
dervs give ok xp and often carry rings, gems, misc.<br/>
items and BRONZE WEAPONS, which sell for plats.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Befallen-- It keeps changing back and forth, but if the DEs<br/>
are there-- it&#39;s good loot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WC-- derv camp<br/>
and orc camp there, but the key here is to hunt<br/>
wisps, bears and spiders. Stack of spider silk sell for<br/>
a lot in Ecomm. Killing bears could result in HQ<br/>
bear pelts, which sell for 20pp easily on XEV (or you<br/>
could use them to make Backpacks to sell for 70pp or<br/>
more). Wisps sometimes drop GLS, which you can auction<br/>
for about 6-7pp, OR turn in for a quest to the<br/>
gypsies in SRO (if you are evil--or have DE illusion), or<br/>
in NK (if good). You get xp for turning in each GLS,<br/>
and you get a concordance of research, which you can<br/>
sell back for 9pp!! As a chanter, the best bet is to<br/>
kill wisps all day long, fill up bags of GLS and LS,<br/>
head to SRO, use illusion DE (when you get it) and<br/>
make tons of cash. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OH-- people say that OOT<br/>
(ocean of tears) is GREAT xp and loot, but i haven&#39;t<br/>
hunted there much except gargoyles and cyclopses at<br/>
higher levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela/Mandir</div>
