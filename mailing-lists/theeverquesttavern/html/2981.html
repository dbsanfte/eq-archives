<br/>
My name is Robert Marks, and I&#39;m the author of the EverQuest Companion, <br/>
a book due out in August from Osborne/McGraw-Hill.  The EverQuest <br/>
Companion, rather than being a hint book, is about the history of the <br/>
game, the community around it, and the issues that have come up.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;ve created a Yahoo group called &quot;The EverQuest Companion&quot; (and <br/>
yes, it took me this long to get around to advertising it...I was busy <br/>
rushing through book chapters at the time), and, with things settling <br/>
down and another three chapters still to put into rough draft, I now <br/>
have time to actually send updates to it.  If anybody is interested in <br/>
keeping track of the book, or just talking about MMORPGs in general, <br/>
please, join!  Now that I have time to make it work, I&#39;m hoping it will <br/>
be a friendly place.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s hoping to see some people there...<br/>
<br/>
Best regards to all,<br/>

&quot;The battle is terrible and now joined by all.<br/>
Count Roland is no laggard;<br/>
He strikes with his spear, while the shaft still lasts.<br/>
With fifteen blows he has broken and destroyed it;<br/>
He draws forth Durendal, his fine, naked sword,<br/>
And spurs on his horse to strike at Chernubles.&quot;<br/>
