<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827240121">I was just thinking about the number of<br/>
engagement rings out there, and was wondering about people&#39;s<br/>
opinion on romance in EQ. I don&#39;t know about how many<br/>
broken homes there are involved, but I do know of EQ<br/>
couples who were &quot;married&quot; in the game, while having<br/>
spouses in real life. There is, of course, quite a bit of<br/>
flirting in the game....but is it ever a problem? What do<br/>
you guys (and gals) think?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blackwaite&lt;br&gt;17<br/>
