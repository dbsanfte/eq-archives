<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426333757">Hello,&lt;br&gt;In your younger years, did you do any<br/>
quests? I am a lvl 8 human druid, and I got her pretty<br/>
decked out in leather with a velium warhammer and a<br/>
qeynos kite shield and most of my spells bought for when<br/>
I hit lvl 9. I love doing quests, besides hacking<br/>
and slashing everything I see--minus bears and wolves<br/>
of course!! Go to all everquest sites you can find<br/>
with your search engine and look up quests, for either<br/>
the zone, race, etc. That is how I have done things<br/>
to make plat. I know it may sound trivial especially<br/>
to a lvl 26 pally now, but hey each their own ;-)</div>
