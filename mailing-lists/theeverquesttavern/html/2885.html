<b>Subject:</b> Re: [The EverQuest Tavern] New Guild Forming in Tribunal <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-416717176">Well it took me a little bit, but I have started a mage char for this <br/>
guild. She just got started so she&#39;s still lvl 1. (lol I haven&#39;t even <br/>
killed anything yet.) I have never played a mage before. How much <br/>
harder is it to play then an enchanter?<br/>
<br/>
Also I&#39;m sorry for not posting lately. I&#39;ve had some major tests in <br/>
Bio and Psych. I&#39;ve also managed to break my hand again so it&#39;s in a <br/>
cast. The bad part is the cast goes past my elbow so it&#39;s kinda hard <br/>
to use a mouse right now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be able to play more during the Quarter Break. I&#39;ll also be able <br/>
to play a bit more next quarter since my schedule won&#39;t be so <br/>
horrible and the classes will be easier.<br/>
