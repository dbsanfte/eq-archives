<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051996609">Well I entered EQ today and create 3 characters,<br/>
one of which is a WE Druid named Legludar.He is in<br/>
Greater Faydark, whereever that is. He gave his note to<br/>
the Heartwood Master who told him to prove his<br/>
loyalty by bringing him a rusty short sword, a rusty<br/>
longsword, a rusty bastard sword and a rusty broad sword.<br/>
Where do I get these things (he wants to destroy them<br/>
and reward me) and where is Greater Faydark? Iam on<br/>
Bertoxxolus.</div>
