<div id="ygrps-yiv-339771885">Well, I can&#39;t help with a GG, but I know about<br/>
reinstalling EQ. Your characters will not be deleted because<br/>
all of your characters are on the server to stop<br/>
people from hacking the characters from their<br/>
harddrives. If you reinstall EQ nothing will happen to your<br/>
characeters =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. Just as proof, you can play your<br/>
characters on another persons computer and since they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have your files, it proves that such files do not<br/>
exist on your hard drive, only on the server.</div>
