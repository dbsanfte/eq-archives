<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-386425315">OK - here is a guide to the messages you get when<br/>
you /con - not including the faction message (ie.<br/>
&quot;looks at you amiably/warmly/dubiously, threateningly&quot;<br/>
etc.).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Creatures that /con even to you - &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When<br/>
you are Lvls 1-12 -- &quot;Looks like an even<br/>
fight&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you are Lvls 13-14 -- &quot;Looks kind of risky - you<br/>
might win&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you are Lvls 15-24 -- &quot;He<br/>
appears to be quite formidable&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BLUE<br/>
/Cons&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You = lvl 1-12 (Mob = 1-3 lvls lower) -- &quot;Looks like<br/>
you would have the upper hand&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You = lvl 13-14<br/>
(Mob = 1-3 lvls lower) -- &quot;Looks kind of risky, but<br/>
you might win&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You = lvl 13-14 (Mob = 4-5 lvls<br/>
lower) -- &quot;Looks like you would have the upper<br/>
hand&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You = lvl 15-24 (Mob = 1-2 lvls lower) -- &quot;Looks kind<br/>
of dangerous&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You = lvl 15-24 (Mob = 3 lvls<br/>
lower) -- &quot;Looks quite risky&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You = lvl 15-24<br/>
(Mob = 4 lvls lower) -- &quot;Looks quite risky, but might<br/>
be worth a try&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You = lvl 15-24 (Mob = 5 lvls<br/>
lower) -- &quot;You would probably win this fight--it&#39;s not<br/>
certain though&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GREEN /Cons&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You = lvl 1-12<br/>
(Mob = 4 lvls or more lower) -- &quot;Looks like a<br/>
reasonably safe opponent&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You = lvl 13-24 (Mob = 6<br/>
lvls or more lower) -- &quot;Looks like a reasoanbly safe<br/>
opponent&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn&#39;t put the messages for above lvl 24, but can<br/>
if requests are made. The guide is good, especially<br/>
at lvls 13 and up, as it lets you know which BLUES<br/>
will give you more experience. You get more the closer<br/>
to your level they are. Also, remember (as i&#39;m sure<br/>
you&#39;ve all found) that just because a Mob or mobs are<br/>
green, doesn&#39;t mean they wont attack you on site--<br/>
especially if they hate you OR you are sitting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope<br/>
this helps -- &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 17th<br/>
