<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030158981">Yup. But I did all of my adventuring until my<br/>
early 20s on Faydwer (the continent with Faydark on<br/>
it), so I never got bound anywhere until I went to<br/>
Kunark at something like level 21. Nothing on Faydark is<br/>
so far away that you have to get bound, IMO.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and someone asked about the legal ramifications<br/>
of running a dating club . . . The possible<br/>
ramifications are that if someone gets assaulted, killed, etc.,<br/>
then in some cases the person running the club might<br/>
get blamed (read: sued) for not running background<br/>
checks on everyone who joins and letting in psychos.<br/>
