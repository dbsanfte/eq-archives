<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319434377">Depends, try different casters guilds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One<br/>
tough thing is to be a bard. Bards have it slightly<br/>
rough b/c their spells are scattered. Level 1 to 7 (I<br/>
believe) are all at both guilds. But once you get to 8<br/>
(again I believe), they have to run around. Spells are<br/>
scattered in Kelethin Bard Guild and FP Bard<br/>
Guild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did it the easy way-- sorta cheat. LOL. I gated<br/>
Fatedhue to Butcher and ran him to Kelethin. Then gated<br/>
and traded it to my bard in WC. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I<br/>
digress, Spell casters can usually bind to most places but<br/>
sometimes no. Sometimes some ppl can bind you to a place<br/>
but you can&#39;t yourself. But those are few and far<br/>
between (Believe Karn&#39;s Tower and Skyshrine are examples<br/>
of both).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the times, if you can cast<br/>
bind, you can bind to anyplace, and if you can&#39;t--<br/>
you&#39;ve got to bind in a zone that is classified as a<br/>
&quot;city&quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, a GREAT site for spells<br/>
is&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/&lt;/a">http://eq.castersrealm.com/&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.. heh... dang, messing with posts<br/>
rather than getting ready for work. Blech/grin</div>
