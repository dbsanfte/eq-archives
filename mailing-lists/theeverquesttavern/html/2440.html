<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707240112">Fairly hard quest and you&#39;re not going to want to<br/>
do it as a druid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jboots are essentially<br/>
permenant SoW affect. Now if you&#39;re worried about your sow<br/>
dropping at wrong times-- then you might want to do the<br/>
quest. It&#39;s a lot of work-- I&#39;d look it up and<br/>
see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as a druid, I sincerely doubt you&#39;d want to.<br/>
Melee&#39;rs desire it greatly though.. heheh. Forget, there&#39;s<br/>
also a Tboot or something like that. A purchased item<br/>
that I believe is an upgrade to jboots. I wish I could<br/>
remember exactly what it was. Anyone want to jump in here<br/>
and remind me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
