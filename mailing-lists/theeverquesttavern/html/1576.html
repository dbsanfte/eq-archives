<div id="ygrps-yiv-834967111">I know a guy who just sold two characters. One<br/>
was at the level cap and the other was only a few<br/>
levels away from it. He got $1500.00 for them on E-bay.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;Friggen nuts man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m new to EQ, it seems<br/>
to me that unless you go through the newbie stuff<br/>
yourself, then you have no connection to the character. So<br/>
it means nothing. What&#39;s the point?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zen.</div>
