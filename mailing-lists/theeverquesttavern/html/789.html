<b>Subject:</b> Which sites I use for what. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-644216774">I was interested to know which sites people use<br/>
for what purposes. Here is how and why I personally<br/>
use each<br/>
one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.castersrealm.com&lt;br&gt;Spells, jewelery, research, patch info, hot forum topics.<br/>
I use this site a lot because I&#39;m an enchanter.<br/>
Also, the webmaster always posts summarized responses<br/>
from Abashi (Gordon) on various hot forum<br/>
topics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.eqmaps.com&lt;br&gt;Weapon stats, maps, NPC mob info, and more. I use this<br/>
site all the time. This is #2 on my list only because<br/>
they don&#39;t have spell info, which I need. I personally<br/>
believe this site has the absolute best layout, search<br/>
features, cross-referrencing, and updates. Amazing<br/>
site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;eq.stratics.com&lt;br&gt;The only thing I really use this site for anymore is<br/>
the &quot;Class Referrence&quot; page which lists the skills<br/>
for each class. Other than that, I never really visit<br/>
anymore. I am not that interested in weddings, new guilds,<br/>
trade bazaars, and the other various community issues<br/>
that seem to constitute the bulk of this site&#39;s<br/>
news.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.maximumeq.com&lt;br&gt;Price refference. It might not be very accurate, but<br/>
many times it can give you a rough estimate. I also<br/>
like how the weapon/armor listings are listed from<br/>
worse to best. You can sort the item searches on EQMaps<br/>
various ways also, but sometimes Maximum EQ is just a<br/>
quicker way of doing<br/>
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.brellserilis.net&lt;br&gt;I only use the forums here. But these forums are<br/>
specifically for Brell, my server. Many great discussions can<br/>
be found here regarding plain/dragon raids, big<br/>
guild matters, etc. I encourage everyone to find the<br/>
&quot;self-declared official&quot; board for their server and check it<br/>
out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;everquest.allakhazam.com&lt;br&gt;Quests. I like this site for quests because all the info<br/>
is edited and placed by the webmaster. So all of it<br/>
is either confirmed, or open disclaimed as a<br/>
possible rumor. But if I can&#39;t find it<br/>
here...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.everlore.com&lt;br&gt;...I go here. I know some people that think this is<br/>
the best EQ site around. I think it&#39;s definately<br/>
good, but I prefer to go to various sites that<br/>
specialize in certain things. The Quest section on Everlore<br/>
is quite expansive and up-to-date. Players<br/>
contribute driectly to the info. But I find it more<br/>
difficult to actually find the info I&#39;m looking for here.<br/>
Half of the posts in the quest section are questions<br/>
about (not answers to) some quest. And some answers<br/>
that you do find have a contradicting post from<br/>
another player on the same page. Kinda<br/>
confusing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eq&#39;Lizer - gameznet.com/eq/&lt;br&gt;I stopped going here after<br/>
EQmaps got rolling. But every now and then you&#39;ll hear<br/>
of some high level item that EQmaps hasn&#39;t added to<br/>
their database yet. Then I&#39;ll check here. The guy who<br/>
maintains this site is a level 50 SK (I<br/>
believe).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also check out various class-specific sites when<br/>
I have a question regarding them. www.eqforge.com<br/>
is a great resource for Rangers, Shaman, and Shadow<br/>
Kinghts. In particular, the Shaman&#39;s Crucible (under<br/>
eqforge.com) has the only good Alchemy section I know<br/>
of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m interested in hearing your thoughts. What sites<br/>
do you use for<br/>
what?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>
