<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090542145">If you&#39;ve never played the game before, Warrior<br/>
is a decent choice. Race doesn&#39;t really matter.<br/>
Warriors are fairly straight-forward to play. Once you get<br/>
the hang of the menus, combat, the chat channels,<br/>
etc. you may want to change classes. If you want to<br/>
experiment with a casting class you could try a Druid or<br/>
Necro. They both have a wide variety of spells. Playing<br/>
them up to level 5 should give you an idea of what you<br/>
like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After playing these, ask yourself:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do I want to<br/>
be offensive or defensive?&lt;br&gt;Do I plan on soloing<br/>
(playing alone) a lot or grouping mostly?&lt;br&gt;Do I prefer<br/>
to cast spells, melee, or some<br/>
combination?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you get used to the game mechanics and can answer<br/>
those questions, come back and ask us what class suits<br/>
you best...if you haven&#39;t already found one you like<br/>
:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar<br/>
