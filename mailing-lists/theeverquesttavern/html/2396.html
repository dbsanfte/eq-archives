<div id="ygrps-yiv-729633927">You should have the best stuff you can get . . .<br/>
Questions like this are unanswerable, since it&#39;s a<br/>
freeform, roleplaying game. Sure, someone&#39;s going to look<br/>
at your stuff and say you should be better equipped<br/>
(like last night in front of Kaladim), but it&#39;s really<br/>
hard to say. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Better off not worrying about it<br/>
and just enjoying the game. Or you could go to<br/>
www.eqprices.com and see what (inflated) prices are like. Then see<br/>
if you think you could afford<br/>
anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht&lt;br&gt;28 Dwarf Rogue</div>
