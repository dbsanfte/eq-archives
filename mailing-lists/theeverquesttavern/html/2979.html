computer and see if the error comes up. If it doesn&#39;t, go ahead and <br/>
copy the file you need from there onto a CD or something and then re-<br/>
copy over to your main system. I had a problem similar when <br/>
installing Wizardry 8. One of the sound.cab files couldn&#39;t install on <br/>
one of my boxes, so I installed the game on another machine and <br/>
bingo, it worked. That means there&#39;s a problem with my CD drive (I <br/>
never bothered fixing it because it only appeared to effect Wizardry <br/>
only and not the other games). It&#39;s probably a driver issue.<br/>
