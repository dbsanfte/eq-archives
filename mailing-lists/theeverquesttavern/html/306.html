<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414648877">As I might have told you before, I don&#39;t have<br/>
everquest, I hope I&#39;ll get it for X-mas, which is like, 92<br/>
DAYS AWAY!!!! And I am so restless and I spend alot of<br/>
time on either reading everquest faq, surfing eq<br/>
sites, or chatting on graphics chat, nothing on my<br/>
computer is any longer entertaining--well, maybe<br/>
sometimes-- but all I have is Grim Fandango, Oddworld, Monkey<br/>
Island, and some other stuff, which I bearly ever do,<br/>
since I&#39;ve had MI for a while and I&#39;ve beaten Grim<br/>
Fandango, I mainly surf the net now or program my simple<br/>
web-pages And/or computer games on VB, I would probally<br/>
spend hours looking at all the pictures in the eq site,<br/>
this club, and dromaster&#39;s eq club, I need something<br/>
new to do while I&#39;m waiting 92 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks, I<br/>
just had to say that,&lt;br&gt;for something to<br/>
do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--Destino88</div>
