<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013456703">In Neriak, in the second zone (can&#39;t remember<br/>
what it&#39;s called, but where the caster&#39;s guild is),<br/>
there is a merchant who sells most, if not all of the<br/>
patterns i think. I think it&#39;s the only place to buy<br/>
patterns in all of Neriak, unless there is a merchant in<br/>
the first zone who does also. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I may be wrong,<br/>
as it&#39;s been some time since i&#39;ve been back to<br/>
Neriak. In fact, I&#39;ve made so many light race friends<br/>
that I&#39;m sure there is a bounty on my head there. Oh<br/>
well... I&#39;m mostly into trickery and tomfollery, not<br/>
evil. I guess I should just stay in Halfling form, as<br/>
that fits my personality a bit better than this dark<br/>
skin I was born with...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mandir&lt;br&gt;DE, ELF, DWF,<br/>
