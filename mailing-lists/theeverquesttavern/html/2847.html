<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491475142">Well, <br/>
Today is patch day. Which means EVERYONE will be trying to connect so <br/>
they can hit the new mobs before everyone else and get the phat l3wt. <br/>
<br/>
You might want to try later in the day. I usually have no problem at <br/>
night on patch day.<br/>
