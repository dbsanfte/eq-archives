<div id="ygrps-yiv-888009478">Sooner or later these tanks will catch<br/>
on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Badtank tells the group, &quot;Why the hell am I dead? Where<br/>
was the cleric?&quot;&lt;br&gt;Cleric tells the group, &quot;Because<br/>
I was dead you ass.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Badtank tells the group,<br/>
&quot;That is it! I&#39;m sick of clerics trying to<br/>
tank!&quot;&lt;br&gt;Cleric tells the group, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have to tank if you<br/>
had taunted the aggros off me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Badtank tells the<br/>
group, &quot;Taunting is the ranger&#39;s job!&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ranger tells<br/>
the group, &quot;I was busy trying to taunt the mobs off<br/>
the druid who had gotten jumped first because of the<br/>
heals to you Badtank.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Druid tells the group,<br/>
&quot;Didn&#39;t work too well. That&#39;s when you stopped getting<br/>
healed Badtank.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Badtank tells the group, &quot;That&#39;s it!<br/>
From now on I&#39;m solo!&quot;&lt;br&gt;Badtank has left the<br/>
group.&lt;br&gt;Monk tells the group, &quot;Um guys.... I&#39;m laying here in<br/>
the middle of Karnor&#39;s and there&#39;s a lot of baddies<br/>
licking their lips.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Monk tells the group, &quot;... and I<br/>
feel a sneeze coming on.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hehehe.....</div>
