<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-61471623">Hello, I am a lvl 9 (2 bubbs from 10) Bard wood<br/>
elf. I am having a hard time finding a place on<br/>
Faydwer. CB is nothing but 2 kills than I have to run,<br/>
ButcherBlock mountains are no good to me because I don&#39;t get<br/>
good exp &#39;cept goblin camps and they are camped when I<br/>
am there. I like to single but sometimes I well<br/>
party. Where is a good place?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winolian&lt;br&gt;Bard on<br/>
