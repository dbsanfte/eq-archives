<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188280929">I&#39;ve hear rumors of Chanters doing this quest at<br/>
lvl 5-- are you trying to buy a SoM?? Just quest it!<br/>
(maybe it&#39;s not as easy as it sounds)-- my chanter on<br/>
Xev doesn&#39;t have one yet-- lvl 17. I can&#39;t believe<br/>
how much chanters rock!! I&#39;m actually still soloing<br/>
evens at lvl 17, but groups are the best ONCE you teach<br/>
people how to work with chanters. There must not be too<br/>
many of us on Xev, because NO ONE knows the group<br/>
dynamic when a chanter is about-- um... NO AOE<br/>
please!!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok-- that is all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the<br/>
36th Season&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mandir (nameless)&lt;br&gt;Chanter of the<br/>
17th illusion</div>
