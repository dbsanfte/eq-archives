<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572540200">The good thing about the goons, is they dont get<br/>
near the part of OT that has the mobs for levels<br/>
14-22. They only walk along the paths from the outpost<br/>
to the SF and FM zone areas, they never get near the<br/>
mudpit or newbie areas unless someone just pulls them<br/>
all the way there.</div>
