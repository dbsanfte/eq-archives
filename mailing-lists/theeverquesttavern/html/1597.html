<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537476092">Me and my friend Matt are making a free on-line<br/>
game like Everquest except not as graphical but it&#39;s<br/>
pretty darn good for a game thats not going to cost you<br/>
anything, anyways we need your help if you could come to<br/>
the club below and post in the club what you want and<br/>
don&#39;t want in this type of game then we will be able to<br/>
make the game as pleasing to the player as<br/>
possible...Or if you just want to drop by to get some details<br/>
about the game your more than welcome too<br/>
