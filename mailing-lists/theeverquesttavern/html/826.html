<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875228241">Hey Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not too fussy about<br/>
dying, which is what I did. My problem is that 9 times<br/>
out of 10, I get disconnected everytime I zone. Until<br/>
I get it fixed, dying worries me because It<br/>
sometimes takes me more than an hour to get to W.Karana<br/>
from Qeynos. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those guys wouldn&#39;t even let me<br/>
get my corpse without ambushing me. I barely drug my<br/>
corspe away with half a bubble of life<br/>
left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Needless to say, BB IS quiter since that night.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the info.</div>
