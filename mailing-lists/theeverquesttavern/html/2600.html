<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414183093">There&#39;s such a huge difference between playing a game like FF and a <br/>
game like EQ. There area differenct reasonas to get &quot;addicted,&quot; that <br/>
is, to want to play and play and play. The rewards system gets you <br/>
hooked-- it&#39;s not about &quot;beating&quot; the game, because that really can&#39;t <br/>
be done. It&#39;s about that next level, those next skills or spells, the <br/>
next item, the next 10 or 100 or 1k or 10k plat. <br/>
<br/>
People have done crazier things than 7 hours of EQ play-- especially <br/>
when it comes to camping and raids. There are 12-24 hours of straight <br/>
play easily. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find people to ditch work, school, <br/>
family events, dates, etc to play. People who play for long periods <br/>
of time are all around. Check with the club/group EverquestAnnonymous <br/>
(if it&#39;s still around). There used to be some posts there all the <br/>
time about what addicted people did for EQ.  <br/>
<br/>
I know people who load the game at work and play during lunch, <br/>
breaks, and after work hourse before going home to play.  I wonder if <br/>
anyone is sneaking vid cards into school computers to play there-- <br/>
hehe.</div>
