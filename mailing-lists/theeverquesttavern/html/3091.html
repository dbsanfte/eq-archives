 <br/>
I guess I&#39;m the loner. I&#39;m on Drinal & Luclin.<br/>
 <br/>
My main is a 41 druid named Charai accompanied by a warrior named Athynna, bard named Jovvi, monk named Whyyte Lhyyte(hehehe), pally named Minniey & a chanter named Tymthyn Jhntr (sound it out - think Monte Python).<br/>
 <br/>
Anyone got suggestions for zones for the druid. Currently camping ruins in Dreadlands, but it is getting slow going xp wise (though cash loot is rather profitable)<br/>
 <br/>
Also, need some ideas for wisdom gear. Charai was 1st character & I made some serious errors setting her up. So looking for some nice mana & wisdom gear. Especially since I am starting on my epic soon  ;)<br/>
