<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277776859">Let me just put this quote from a board msg...<br/>
&quot;&lt;br&gt;From what I can tell this does absolutly nothing. I<br/>
think the game designers put this in the game so people<br/>
would post messages on message boards asking what it<br/>
does, and then laugh at the wild and kooky answers<br/>
given in replies.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find this to be fairly apt<br/>
so far. It probably does do SOMETHING... but<br/>
whatever it is-- it&#39;s hard to figure out and how to do it.<br/>
There&#39;s references to possible Smithing recipes as Forges<br/>
got increased in slots a while back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s<br/>
also references to quests and something called a<br/>
Gemcutter&#39;s bag that gets created when you combine the<br/>
Gemcutter in someway (some say by itself in a toolbox-- but<br/>
I have no way of verifying this-- many things are<br/>
just speculations).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you find out anything...<br/>
plz post it and let us know. I&#39;ve spent several hours<br/>
and still finding nothing on this. Many references.<br/>
Ah well... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out... FatedHue of the<br/>
Drinal Server.</div>
