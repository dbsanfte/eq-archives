<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343072222">Hail, friends! I will be soon be leaving the<br/>
world we call Norrath =( . I would like to thank all of<br/>
you for a GREAT time. Special thanks to all Black<br/>
Moon members, and extra special gratitude to<br/>
Greyhound, Torbrashal, Hunnyb, Qalar, Fareb, and my other<br/>
close EQ buddies. In case you were wondering why i am<br/>
leaving, my funding has been cut. I have a job but i don&#39;t<br/>
have a credit card, and if i am not mistaken, that is<br/>
the only way to pay for your account. Well, keep<br/>
having fun and remember me =`) *sniff sniff*&lt;br&gt; -<br/>
