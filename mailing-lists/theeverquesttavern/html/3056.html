<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-888808274">DUe to the frequent changes sony/varent has induced into this game <br/>
such as revamping some perfectly fine zones and make them harder than <br/>
orginaly, and swiping c3 and even c2 from our collective grasp, my <br/>
famley members who play this game will be writing sony and they will <br/>
shortly and most likely <br/>
be quiting this game, which in effect may lead to my defection as <br/>
well due to the incressing dificulty of this so call &quot;class balancing&quot;<br/>
now mind you this is total horse shit on sonys part, and they are <br/>
taking all the fun and adventur out of this game by making every <br/>
thing totaly impossible and un reachable, now i know not every one <br/>
feels like this but not every one is a druid who with out c3 can <br/>
cast no more that 3 spells with out haveing to sit for 20 minets and <br/>
meddititing for example<br/>
<br/>
What im asking my fellow everquest players and there friends is for <br/>
there suport in the effort we are trying to get sony to see, that <br/>
they are systematicly desimating a game that once was fun and <br/>
enjoyable. Once this letter is writin i will have it in <br/>
the forums  with sonys email which we have directed these coments.<br/>
We would appriciate the suport of our fellow gamers and friends if <br/>
they too would also after that time email sony and the like with <br/>
their concers and grips- please once this is posted consider our <br/>
request as some one has to fight back again the few who decide they <br/>
need to nerf our spells, our strengh and our fun in this game <br/>
<br/>
I am asking for the suport of fellow games in showing there <br/>
displesure for the changes that are taking place with this game and <br/>
im hoping to fight back against the evil that is the everquest <br/>
managemnt. <br/>
thank you for taking your time to read this</div>
