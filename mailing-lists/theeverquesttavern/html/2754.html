<div id="ygrps-yiv-111016813">Someone else cast Sow on me so I got in without any<br/>
trouble...  Swimming wasn&#39;t a problem for me bc I<br/>
spend 14 hros a day on everquest 7hrs at work and take<br/>
20 min naps every 3 hours... My brain don&#39;t work so<br/>
good anymore.. I got out though, someone was kind<br/>
enough to help me to get out by distracting the 20+<br/>
gnolls blocking the only exit.. And as far as binding,<br/>
I was bound to Qeynos, then I did the stupid and bound<br/>
myself at the skeleton in the Arena.. LOL  I love<br/>
being a nOOb later..<br/>

&gt; Lake Rathe is actually a part of Antonica.  From the<br/>
&gt; sounds of it  the<br/>
&gt; gnolls you are talking about are near the South<br/>
&gt; Karana zone.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; remember when Bards get the Equivalent of sow  nor<br/>
&gt; do I remember when they<br/>
&gt; get Invis song.  But if you can find someone who can<br/>
&gt; float you so you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to wear yourself out on swimming form the<br/>
&gt; Arena, Invis and sow you  or<br/>
&gt; even accompany you  then that would be the best<br/>
&gt; route for you to go.<br/>
&gt; Suggestion as well if you want to hunt in Qeynos get<br/>
&gt; someone to bind you  at<br/>
&gt; the Gates of the City of Qeynos so if you die again<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t have to worry<br/>
&gt; about the gnolls any more<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hail, And well me John.  You say you have a vast<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowledge of Kunark?? well, maybe you can help me.<br/>
&gt;  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a lvl 9 half-elf bard and he is stuck<br/>
&gt; respawning<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the arena, both surrounding zones are empty,<br/>
&gt; but,<br/>
&gt; &gt; whenever I try to leave Rathetear Lake I always<br/>
&gt; meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; up with some gnoll shamans and get slaughtered....<br/>
&gt; &gt; One might ask how in all the worlds I got a lvl 9<br/>
&gt; bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; safely to The Arena,  Lets just say I abused SoW a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little, I was spawning in Qeynos, and was trying<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; reach Freeport, and got lost somewhere in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; middle... Any assistance in theis matter would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; greatly appreciated,<br/>
