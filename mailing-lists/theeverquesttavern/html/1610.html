<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245983379">We&#39;re all missing the bigger question--- Why did<br/>
you STOP PLAYING????? hahahaha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re<br/>
getting the acount key message, that means that either<br/>
YOU or someone else has already registered under that<br/>
code. If YOU have played before, that means you already<br/>
have entered that account key, and you can still<br/>
access it (IF YOU HAVE CONTINUED TO PAY) if you remember<br/>
your station name and password. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: IF you<br/>
stopped paying and let your account lapse-- YOU CAN NO<br/>
LONGER USE THIS ACCOUNT KEY. Unless it has been changed,<br/>
Verant&#39;s policy is that a lapsed account cannot be<br/>
reactivated and the account key becomes invalid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At<br/>
least, that&#39;s what i&#39;ve read. There was a big warning<br/>
not to let your account lapse or you would loose that<br/>
account for good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
