<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595372528">Cool. I&#39;ve never had any animals help me except<br/>
for charm spells... which I don&#39;t really<br/>
use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OH! I did find out something really cool though. From<br/>
a fairly reliable source... someone&#39;s told me that<br/>
he&#39;s killed a LOT of woodland bears and wolves. AND<br/>
he&#39;s still Amiable. At least on the Veeshan server--<br/>
there is no bear and wolf faction. Weird. I didn&#39;t<br/>
think that was all a myth-- b/c I thought I remembered<br/>
Kodiaks agroing to my character...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But either they<br/>
changed it... or I remember incorrectly. Cause I have it<br/>
worded from a recent Veeshan druid... that it doesn&#39;t<br/>
hurt him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
