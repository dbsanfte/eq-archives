<div id="ygrps-yiv-922741760">Right. The UK one is the only one that is<br/>
geographic, I think. I know Rodcet Nife has a French<br/>
population and a Swedish population, as well. If you are<br/>
looking for one in your area, just start playing on a<br/>
server that is full near peak time. Chances are, there<br/>
will be people from your area. Best of luck in<br/>
