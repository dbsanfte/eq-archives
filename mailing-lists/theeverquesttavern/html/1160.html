<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596992418">About putting a point in all skills. Not to be<br/>
dissentious, but ... when you get to a higher level, putting<br/>
one point into an skill gets you more starting level<br/>
in that skill. EI... once you hit level 10-- the 1st<br/>
point you put in a skill starts you at either 5 or 10.<br/>
(Correct me if I&#39;m wrong). So if it&#39;s a skill you don&#39;t<br/>
use much, I find it better to wait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For<br/>
example, if I&#39;m not going to use say, jewelry making till<br/>
I hit level 30 or I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever use a<br/>
piercing weapon... I might wait till level 30 and then<br/>
pump a point in it when I&#39;ve got a worthy weapon of<br/>
that type to use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That way I&#39;m making most<br/>
effective use of my points and if I REALLY need to say --<br/>
pump a sudden 20 points in a skill I&#39;ve discovered is<br/>
far too low-- I won&#39;t hurt myself with wasted<br/>
points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman, Monk (6th)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... just presenting<br/>
alternatives. And of course, anytime you get a new skill, put a<br/>
point in it. Unless of course it&#39;s the rogue&#39;s<br/>
detect/sense trap. Heh. Then just wait for the expansion,<br/>
zone, and prac it. I just read the guide and it sounds<br/>
like you autogain ability to use it just by zoning.<br/>
Even if you&#39;ve never put a point in it. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS.<br/>
Trying to wade through all the prev messages on this<br/>
board. Up to like 723, and I&#39;ve watched Trellan get to<br/>
level 47, leave, come back again, fade for a while and<br/>
reannounce himself. I almost feel like I know the person.<br/>
