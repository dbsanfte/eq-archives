<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-75682248">Not bad, Xela -- 558 words to my 438! But, I<br/>
think you still have to compete with my July 19th<br/>
two-part post, and Shooman is also a contender for the<br/>
long-post crown . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, on the topic at hand.<br/>
There&#39;s a lot to be said for the argument that<br/>
_knowledge_ is twinking. I can no longer start a Dwarf or<br/>
Wood Elf without knowing exactly where to go, who to<br/>
talk to and get quests from. I long for the true<br/>
newbie days, when you really had no idea what was going<br/>
on, what was around the next corner. That, more than<br/>
boredom, would be what drives players to a new game such<br/>
as DAoC, I think. I probably won&#39;t move, however, as<br/>
I like EQ a lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, what&#39;s a little FS or<br/>
bronze between friends? On top of that is the twinking<br/>
handouts given you by other players. My characters traded<br/>
between them, giving the warrioress a Fine Steel 2H Sword<br/>
. . . this was after some guy walked out of the<br/>
bank, said, &quot;Can you use this?&quot; and gave me a Velium<br/>
Short Sword. Yow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, my attitude toward at<br/>
least mild twinking has evidently changed. But if any<br/>
of you ever catch me with a second level warrior in<br/>
full bronze (which I&#39;ve seen), feel free to /rude me<br/>
and hound me for hypocrisy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht, who has<br/>
way too much time on his hands at work</div>
