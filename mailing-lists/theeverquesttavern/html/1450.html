<div id="ygrps-yiv-884741248">A friend of mine recently seemed positive about<br/>
the following statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that while at<br/>
some game shop in Minesota, he saw someone get changed<br/>
over from like Cleric to Necro (he wasn&#39;t sure about<br/>
beginning class).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That the guy was sat in some sorta<br/>
limbo where he gained exp b/c he had a GM<br/>
friend...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that the guy was level 65, and that the GM was<br/>
named Thor or something similar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I don&#39;t<br/>
really know what to think about the Exp limbo or the<br/>
class changes. I suspect that that has to be possible<br/>
for some bug cures or something...<br/>
BUT...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no level 65 is there??? No one that anyone<br/>
knows that can get higher than 60 right? I don&#39;t know<br/>
if my friend was completely wacko there.. but eh<br/>
well. Just thought I&#39;d check and see what the general<br/>
community thought of this matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>

really picked up lately. =)</div>
