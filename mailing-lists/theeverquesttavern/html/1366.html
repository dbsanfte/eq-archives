<b>Subject:</b> Thinking about which-- grouping <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-346028557">Thinking about which-- are there any in<br/>
Characters on the Drinal server that know dungeons well? I<br/>
know very little about dungeons and have been killing<br/>
at the Aviaks. Loot there is good but looking for<br/>
good items and exp that drop in dungeons now.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m a level 23 druid that gets most play in on Tues<br/>
and Thurs about 4 or 5 pm to 10pm at night. That&#39;s<br/>
CST since I&#39;m in Texas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... CST.. Chapter Story Teller. There&#39;s my LARPer<br/>
side popping out again. Grin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>
Prismatic, Drinal Server of the 23rd-- looking forward to<br/>
level 24 spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS... sorry EQrogue. Would<br/>
love to group with the backstabbing vixen female<br/>
rogues that are around. =) But yes... on Drinal. =/<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPPS EQ and flirting. Evilly addicting. I had a poor<br/>
girl asking me if I were a female or a man once<br/>
though. I play a male wood elf. Sadly enough, I was<br/>
flattered. Usually ppl just ask me if I&#39;m gay. LOL. My<br/>
answer to them is -- what wood elf isn&#39;t of the merriest<br/>
of spirit when prowling through the forest<br/>
prismatic???</div>
