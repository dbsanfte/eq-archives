<div id="ygrps-yiv-754442130">well guys, been reading about the<br/>
upgrade...sounds like a pain..but fun... my boyfriend and i<br/>
decided to delete eq from the computer and pay more<br/>
attention to our relationship. now he&#39;s beggin me to put it<br/>
back, but i just know what it does to us:) anyways...my<br/>
computer wouldn&#39;t work for the expansion anyhow. how many<br/>
of you are playing w/the new upgraded systems?<br/>
eventually we will buy a new pc w/the requirements and go<br/>
full fledged eq again...till then it&#39;s ok to give it a<br/>
rest :) update me , comments,<br/>
anything!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks,&lt;br&gt;Catriana, Dyanora, Tulieni...whatever</div>
