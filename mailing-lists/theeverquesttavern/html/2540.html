<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057392276">Very good points Xela. I was going on the<br/>
assumtion that the choices were &quot;more damage&quot; or &quot;more AC<br/>
and Agility&quot; with both choices being more or less a<br/>
mutually exclusive thing. =) Warriors tend to complain<br/>
that they don&#39;t do enough damage. Know that was true<br/>
of palys and warriors before(haven&#39;t heard it since<br/>
they upgraded damge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agility is an often<br/>
ignored stat. The dex in the bracers are way worth the AC<br/>
loss though unless you&#39;re soloing. You&#39;ll do a bit<br/>
more damage, be better with the bow and proc damage.<br/>
(I say you&#39;ll do more damage b/c you&#39;ll swing a<br/>
little faster.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind slipping at the moment but<br/>
believe you said you were Ranger right? So bow kiting is<br/>
probably a concern. (Course I know plenty of rangers that<br/>
don&#39;t do it. Don&#39;t see why not. A well timed snare/bow<br/>
pull can get off 3 to 5 shots before you even get back<br/>
to the group)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
