<div id="ygrps-yiv-738913689">Hrmmm... well straight melee&#39;s usually have more<br/>
money than casters or hybrids. This is because we have<br/>
to worry about spells. Those cost plat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
used to have money problems too. After I got gate, it<br/>
helped greatly with money. I&#39;d got to velious or<br/>
dreadlands or FV. Good gate places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another thing I<br/>
used to do was the CB belt quest. That&#39;s good for<br/>
faction, Exp, AND some coins. It also gives you and item.<br/>
I decked my Druid in leather that way and sold<br/>
extras for a few gold each. Not too bad. You can also<br/>
sell CB belts for a plat a piece. But the faction and<br/>
exp always made me turn in the belts. Too valuable in<br/>
too many ways to sell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh... but sell your DF<br/>
belts. Reason I say that is cause it gives you terrible<br/>
faction hits. Those that don&#39;t care about faction-- well<br/>
that&#39;s okay I suppose. I sell DF belts for about 2 to 4<br/>
plat each though and to me-- that&#39;s a lot more<br/>
important than killing my faction that I&#39;d have to work to<br/>
regain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s just my 2 cents on CB versus DF<br/>
belts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS...<br/>
CB=crushbone, DF=deathfist.&lt;br&gt;Both are bands of Orcs in EQ</div>
