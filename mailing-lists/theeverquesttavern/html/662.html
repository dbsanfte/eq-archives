<div id="ygrps-yiv-898117220">I&#39;ve had some problem with people getting in my<br/>
face after I get back from turning in my necklaces<br/>
from the Nybright sister quest. They start shouting<br/>
Kill stealer when I take a sister every now and then<br/>
from this newly arrived group. I don&#39;t think that<br/>
anyone should assume they own anything just because they<br/>
happen to be there when no one else is. I know it all<br/>
depends on the situation, and that might should make<br/>
right in certain situation. Some lone player shouldn&#39;t<br/>
assume that he can get into rotation for a rare spawn<br/>
with a whole group. I personally don&#39;t think the GMs<br/>
should get involve, if 2 powerfull groups can&#39;t find a<br/>
working relationship and share items then they should<br/>
just compete for it, it&#39;s more realistic than bringing<br/>
the game masters into it, it totally disrupts the<br/>
whole roleplaying atmosphere. I think its a good rule<br/>
but it should be enforced rarely.</div>
