<b>Subject:</b> Re: SK&#39;s of Pallies? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-110748163">Another reply mentioned that the discussion was<br/>
Paladin vs SK, not vs Necro. I&#39;d have to agree with the<br/>
Paladin&#39;s poor odds against a Necro :(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Even if he<br/>
is blinded the pally could target...&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The SK<br/>
would be the one blinded, not the Paladin. Paladin&#39;s<br/>
get Flash of Light. Engulfing Darkness sounds like it<br/>
should blind you (darkness ya know?) but it&#39;s just a DOT<br/>
that slows movement also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow, I think the<br/>
assumption was that the SK would use Darkness + Shadow Step<br/>
to keep his distance. Then he could use his<br/>
supperior offensive spells to his advantage. The pet would<br/>
be a constant annoyance to the paladin. If the<br/>
Paladin takes a few moments to kill the pet, the SK is<br/>
given free reign to cast spells, HT, or even summon<br/>
another pet right when the other dies :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I<br/>
keep wondering how possible it is for a SK to actually<br/>
KILL a paladin using only his weak necro spells and a<br/>
weak pet. The SK would have to get the Paladin down to<br/>
about 2 bubbles and get a quick HT in before the<br/>
Paladin used his LOH. I don&#39;t think it be that easy to do<br/>
3 bubbles worth of damage to a HP buffed paladin<br/>
using low level necro spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The paladin has<br/>
two options, either keep trying to close the distance<br/>
to the SK (a bad move IMO), or go spell for spell.<br/>
If I were the paladin, I&#39;d probably try to kill the<br/>
pet while constantly Flashing the SK. After the pet<br/>
was dead, I&#39;d just heal myself (and keep flashing)<br/>
until the SK basically ran out of mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think<br/>
most people agree that if you take away both their<br/>
spells (and the pet), that a paladin would defeat a SK<br/>
in pure Melee becuase of his pre-fight HP and AC<br/>
buffs, and because LOH is better than HT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These<br/>
are just my opinions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll restate the<br/>
assumptions of the duel for those just joining this<br/>
thread:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Both Human with same (or similar) equipment. No<br/>
Ghoulbanes :)&lt;br&gt;2) Both roughly level 30 (I kinda assumed<br/>
this, maybe I&#39;m wrong)&lt;br&gt;3) The duel is to the<br/>
death.&lt;br&gt;4) It&#39;s planned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#4 means both players let<br/>
each other fully buff/summon and med before the battle<br/>
begins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should also be noted that no special items are<br/>
being considered. Egg Pumices kinda throw this argument<br/>
out of whack :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on<br/>
