<div id="ygrps-yiv-432997447">hrmm.. well.. depends on your style of play. If<br/>
you solo, or if you group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would say that<br/>
the suggestions of the others are good. I killed<br/>
*thinks back hard* on Orc hill I believe. In the<br/>
Faydarks, someone I believe mentioned that bandit camps. I<br/>
agree. Those are some good exp and they have the<br/>
necklace quests too. The Nybright sisters are good but you<br/>
might need some help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn&#39;t move into CB<br/>
until 10 to 12 I believe. Then I went to Derv camps in<br/>
North Ro. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re looking to solo, probably<br/>
beetles in Butcherblock are the way to go. They&#39;re<br/>
generally easy enough to isolate and aren&#39;t as tough as<br/>
basilisks. 8 might be a little low for a Wizzie to do<br/>
beetles though. Good for melees or better yet-- groups.<br/>
Had a bard friend that loved them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatehue<br/>

Antiquities-- growing&lt;br&gt;stronger every day. =)</div>
