 yeah I know it is yet another EQ web site but I&#39;ve been working on this off<br/>
and on for quite sometime now and I wanted some feed back on what I have<br/>
done so far.  I already know that the commentary page is screwed up atm.<br/>
I&#39;m still trying to work out the bugs on it.  The page entire site is still<br/>
on its infant stages  but  I would appreciate any feedback via this email<br/>
addy that you can give me<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>
<br/>
