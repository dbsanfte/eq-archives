<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289349817">I have advise for dungun fighting and not just in<br/>
cazic, although I&#39;ve had the most experience in the<br/>
dungen of Cazic. &lt;br&gt;** Casters never stay in a group<br/>
without at least 2 tanks!!!!!!! Cazic is a big time train<br/>
zone and you WILL be jumped so you need one tank<br/>
killing a monster and the other killing and TAUNTING the<br/>
others off you. I prefer Trolls or Ogres simply because<br/>
of the sheer number of Hp they have and I love when<br/>
they rollplay =) Obviously if you have a troll or ogre<br/>
tank they should do the taunting.&lt;br&gt;**Always have an(<br/>
/assist mr.X ) hotkey button. Make sure the rest of the<br/>
group does as well. Pick the one tank who kills one<br/>
thing at a time and not the one taunting. &lt;br&gt;**Use the<br/>
assist button and make sure everyone else is too! In<br/>
Cazic you HAVE to have everyone killing the same<br/>
monster to get them out of the way. VERY important. If 2<br/>
gators a Fanatic and a Sent. attack always have everyone<br/>
killing the same beast, in this senerio kill the fanatic<br/>
first or it will heal the rest. then move to the gators<br/>
then the Sent. or what ever just make sure you are all<br/>
working on the same beast. The taunting tanks will have<br/>
to keep the rest of the creatures carroled but he<br/>
will also keep mainly killing the Fanatic. &lt;br&gt;**My<br/>
dream group would have a troll/ogre warrior doing the<br/>
taunting, a troll/ogre killing and pulling, a cleric<br/>
healing, a shaman buffing, SoWing, and shrinking the<br/>
tanks, a mage/ench/wizzy nuking, and myslf a DE Necro.<br/>
The trolls/ogres can give the rest of the group time<br/>
to evac if things go bad and still have the Hp to<br/>
survive and run. (Not really a tip but a good idea of the<br/>
kind of group to look for) &lt;br&gt;**Casters here is a<br/>
good rule of thumb about nuking in a dungen when you<br/>
have tanks in the group. Don&#39;t nuke very often. Learn<br/>
when to nuke and when NOT to nuke/DoT. If your tanks<br/>
are killing it without losing a lot of HP DON&#39;T waste<br/>
your mana! Save it. You might start feeling a little<br/>
useless but don&#39;t. There will come a time when you are<br/>
VERY mobbed and your spells are needed, save your mana<br/>
until you need it. If you just start blasting away you<br/>
won&#39;t be able to blast when you need to. Another<br/>
consequence is that you might aggro the beast on you. Things<br/>
in dungens hit HARD and can kill you quick if the<br/>
tanks can&#39;t taunt them off you. Stupid nuking really<br/>
p.o.&#39;s and endangers the rest of the group. When I first<br/>
started in Cazic I died A LOT and it was mainly because<br/>
of my nuking stupidly. A good rule of thumb is to<br/>
nuke a beast ONE time per loss of ONE tank&#39;s bubble of<br/>
health. AND if you are the group healer then make SURE<br/>
you save you mana for HEALING! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cont.</div>
