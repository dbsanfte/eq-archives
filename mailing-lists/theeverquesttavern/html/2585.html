<div id="ygrps-yiv-943211152">I did CB to 18 myself to my shame but then i moved to highpass off <br/>
kith forest to 21 its great exp but seems to be only camped from 10am <br/>
to 1am and MUST be a group then i moved to the highpass keep.   ON <br/>
another toon I moved at 18 from highpass to South Karana to hunt at <br/>
KFC or avaik huts this is a 18 to 26 area or hunt gnolls in lake <br/>
rath.  on the solo side try East karana animals by the xorbb or <br/>
wodden bridge side.  also on solo side is Lava storm and Najena.  if <br/>
you dont have expansions do the oasis-highpass-highkeep-splitpaw-SOl <br/>
A-GUk-hole to mid 50s<br/>
 <br/>
hope this helps .... Bard of Povar<br/>
