<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006197520">well, post 45 you should contact your nearest<br/>
guild wizard for in depth information. And like<br/>
Stormfang said, have a damned good raiding party to go<br/>
along with you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pre 45ers wanting to go to the<br/>
plane of Hate: See the friendly guards in Nektulos and<br/>
I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be more than happy to send you to<br/>
their father. LOL.... not really, I&#39;m kidding. It&#39;s<br/>
