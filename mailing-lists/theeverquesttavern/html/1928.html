<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494773402">Once again, my lump sum of stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) sorry<br/>
to hear. Yeah. Lotsa meanies and unintentional<br/>
meanies and teenagers (not meant in a derogatory way--<br/>
but they tend to believe they are invulnerable, are<br/>
often hyperactive to get started and forget to listen<br/>
to long time players.. etc. But I&#39;ve met a lot of<br/>
GOOD teenage players under 16 even.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However,<br/>
for every 10 mean acts, there are often 5 good acts.<br/>
A simple buff, a kind retort, etc. =) It&#39;s<br/>
definately a mixed game. It&#39;s not a perfect game by any<br/>
means, but definately fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Iskar monk. Great.<br/>
However, new players shouldn&#39;t play monk. Plain and<br/>
simply-- fustration on weight cap. Many ppl don&#39;t realize<br/>
that they have a weight cap for an AC bonus. If over<br/>
14 stones-- you start suffering. Which makes looting<br/>
a pain. Also, monks are hard to play. Many monks<br/>
and warriors I meet have an immortal complex.<br/>
Especially, iskar monks with a good safe fall and feign<br/>
death. However, in a group-- that can hurt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m<br/>
not saying don&#39;t start with Iskar monks. They rock.<br/>
Just prepare for a little bit of being poor Plat wise<br/>
for a while, and lotsa hard work, and making sure you<br/>
practice mend, feign, and safe fall. =) Sadly, you will<br/>
need to find some light blunt weapons b/c hand to hand<br/>
is better for you at first but later on-- monks have<br/>
some awesome 1h blunts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Yeah, yeah. I love<br/>
my druid. But I appreciate all classes. Grin. I just<br/>
like playing druid, bard and warrior best. I can find<br/>
a party role for any class. And unlike a lot of<br/>
ppl, I find I love to group with any class as long as<br/>
it&#39;s a balanced party (aka I won&#39;t take another druid<br/>
if I&#39;ve got 2 druids in the group already and no<br/>
melee, etc). Ppl that say necro&#39;s are useless in a<br/>
group-- haven&#39;t worked enough with necros.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There<br/>
might be a bias towards playing a druid for me, but<br/>
that&#39;s b/c I like being a jack of all trades in a group.<br/>
I do nothing well, but can usually find a niche. I<br/>
hate soloing but acknowledge a druid&#39;s ability to<br/>
quad, and up to octa kite (don&#39;t ask. Had a friend<br/>
watch it and he told me about it. Most I&#39;ve seen is 6.<br/>
I&#39;d heard ppl brag about octa kiting. Before I had a<br/>
friend see it, I thought they were lying. But someone<br/>
was Octakiting Cougars. Lotsa ppl on Drinal<br/>
complained that day. LOL. I don&#39;t think the guy was able to<br/>
do it long b/c that&#39;s against the rules.<br/>
Technically, so is quad kiting.).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) That&#39;s enough for<br/>
now. Too long a post already anyway. Grin. Be well<br/>
all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatehue Prismatic, Drinal server Druid&lt;br&gt;Member of<br/>
