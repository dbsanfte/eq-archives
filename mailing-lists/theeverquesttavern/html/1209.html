<div id="ygrps-yiv-18314769">Actually, I figured out what happened b/c I<br/>
placed a call to Verant. I didn&#39;t think I would get<br/>
through but I was busy doing stuff near the phone anyway<br/>
and so figured I&#39;d try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During my install,<br/>
everything went in except the Vpatch. This must happen quite<br/>
a bit b/c they just e-mailed me the vpatch program.<br/>
I ran it, and afterwards, it put the button on my<br/>
EQ main executable file. They seemed to know exactly<br/>
what was going on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And since then, I also have<br/>
not lagged or dl&#39;d from Drinal (although that&#39;s only<br/>
2 hours I&#39;ve been able to play since then).<br/>
Hopefully the patches fixed disconnect and lag issues for<br/>
me as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if anyone is missing that<br/>
button-- one thing they did say was not to reinstall-- get<br/>
the vpatch program and save it to the EQ directory.<br/>
Run the vpatch and everything will be<br/>
alright.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman/FatedHue</div>
