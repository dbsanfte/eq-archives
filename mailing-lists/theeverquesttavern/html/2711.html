<div id="ygrps-yiv-619050695">First things first, you are playing a Shadow Knight, and if you <br/>
haven&#39;t already figured it out, you are what is called a &quot;hybred&quot; <br/>
class.  You are a cross between a Warrior and a Necromancer.  At lvl <br/>
9, you get spells.  You can ask someone in the game if you need help <br/>
with that, just go to your guild in Neraik and buy them.  (should <br/>
only cost about a plat or two at that lvl)  Dark Elfs are hated my <br/>
ALL races except troll, Ogre, and Vah Shir (someone correct me if I <br/>
am wrong with any of this BTW).  You can bring up your faction (how <br/>
the NPCs in other cities like you, or don&#39;t like you) by killing most <br/>
monsters around the area.  For example, if you wanted to go to the <br/>
cities of Kalidim, Felwithe, or Kelethin (all on Faydwer) you would <br/>
need to go to the zone Clan Crushbone and kill orcs which would give <br/>
you positive faction with some citizens of that city.  If you can get <br/>
your faction up enough with the guards that you can enter the city <br/>
you can try to do quests that are given by other citizens for <br/>
factions with merchants, guards, etc. One more thing, IF you decide <br/>
to go to CB (crushbone) and fight to get your faction up, <br/>
BEWARE!!!!!  They lower your faction with Indigo Brotherhood, which, <br/>
to my understanding, is a BIG part of Dark Elf faction and if you <br/>
kill to many you wont be able to get into your own city to do quests, <br/>
train, or anything else.  Hope this helps.<br/>
