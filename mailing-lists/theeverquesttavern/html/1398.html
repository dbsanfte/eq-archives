<div id="ygrps-yiv-954514742">I&#39;ve also just recently started, and found that<br/>
some of the guides really help (www.everlore.com;<br/>
everquest.allakhazam.com also has some good stuff, and ZDNet&#39;s GameSpot<br/>
has two very helpful guides:<br/>
&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/">http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/&lt;/a">http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/&lt;/a</a>&gt;). In some cases, you&#39;ll have no idea what they&#39;re<br/>
talking about, but eventually it will make<br/>
sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember -- &quot;con&quot; everything. Target something by clicking<br/>
on it (or hit F8 to target the nearest &quot;MoB&quot;<br/>
(monster)), and then hit /c, or the Consider button. You&#39;ll<br/>
get a color-coded response; this is what Gamespot<br/>
says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-If something cons white/black and gives the message:<br/>
&quot;Looks like an even fight,&quot; it&#39;s of the same level as<br/>
you and may be a fair fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-If something<br/>
cons blue and gives the message: &quot;Looks like you would<br/>
have the upper hand,&quot; it&#39;s a level or two lower than<br/>
you, and you&#39;ll stand a good chance of<br/>
winning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-If something cons yellow and gives the message:<br/>
&quot;Looks like quite a gamble,&quot; it&#39;s a level or two higher<br/>
than you, and you probably wouldn&#39;t beat it in a<br/>
straight fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-If something cons green and gives<br/>
the message: &quot;You would probably win this fight,&quot;<br/>
it&#39;s three or more levels lower than you, and you&#39;d<br/>
probably win easily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-If something cons red and<br/>
gives the message: &quot;What would you like your tombstone<br/>
to say,&quot; it&#39;s three or more levels higher than you,<br/>
and you&#39;d probably lose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK, that&#39;s the first<br/>
thing. Beyond that, count on the kindness of strangers .<br/>
. . including the guards, of course, but also<br/>
fellow players. Most are pretty helpful, I&#39;ve found.<br/>
Need a guide around Kelethin&#39;s annoying platforms?<br/>
Just ask, and someone is likely to come around. And<br/>
don&#39;t get frustrated, dying is OK, at least until level<br/>
5. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoy, and good<br/>
hunting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht, late of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;3rd season Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal<br/>
