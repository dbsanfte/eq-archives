<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915892947">I quit EQ about 2 months ago and I think it was<br/>
one of the best decisions I have ever made. I was a<br/>
complete addict, I played atlest 9 hours a day, even<br/>
school nights, I let it take over my life. I was able to<br/>
get a paladin to lvl 55, win roll on CoF, win roll on<br/>
granite face grinder, and many other high end items. I<br/>
also got a cleric to 47, and started him on collecting<br/>
gear from hate. Overall, I put in too much time into<br/>
something that doesnt give back. I could have been working<br/>
out, studying, working, anything, but no, I was<br/>
sitting on my computer playing EQ.&lt;br&gt;Dont get me wrong,<br/>
everquest is the most fun and most involved game I have<br/>
ever played in my life, but not without a cost<br/>
=/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone whos life was a little like mine, and you are<br/>
thinking of quiting, I highly suggest it. You will go out<br/>
more, and have more fun in general. I used to get<br/>
stressed like crazy, like while raiding naggy or PoF, and<br/>
the server would go down. I about pulled my hair out<br/>
and broke down over a game =/ Pretty pathetic. Now I<br/>
just keep in touch with all of the friends I made, and<br/>
do the things I used to do when i was &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;by the way, my name is bob =)&lt;br&gt;im a new member<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;gotta head out, have a great day&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;bob d</div>
