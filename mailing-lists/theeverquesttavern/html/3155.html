  I knew things could only get so bad before they started to look up...<br/>
<br/>
  Tomorrow I go in for the drug testing portion, than orientation for<br/>
  the job I am getting. Thankfully I follow rules, laws, and try to do<br/>
  my best in life so no worries! The teacher/parent meeting let me know<br/>
  my son was above his class. He&#39;s at the level now in the first of<br/>
  three trimesters that he should be by the end of the year. Today he<br/>
  brought home another award, I&#39;m sure he has all 4 &quot;As&quot; so I&#39;ll owe<br/>
  him $20, and he&#39;s behaving very well. With his award he gets his<br/>
  picture taken and put on a local restaurants wall as well as a free<br/>
  dinner.<br/>
<br/>
  I make it a point to frame and hang Vincent&#39;s awards and achievements<br/>
  so he&#39;s driven to do his best and aime high in life. At the same time<br/>
  the few times he does see his dad it helps to keep his self-esteem<br/>
  high when his father does something to lower it.<br/>
<br/>
  We are one step closer to our family goals!! We want to buy a 4<br/>
  bedroom house. My fianc├⌐ will have his own computer room, privacy,<br/>
  and can do basically what he wants with his space. Vincent was<br/>
  promised a dog when we get a house and I hope he keeps up with<br/>
  cleaning up after it, feeding it, and making sure it has water. I on<br/>
  the other hand only care about having a big kitchen with a center<br/>
  island. Plus, we still have to think about our goals to get married,<br/>
  the dress will probably be the highest price tag. The photographer,<br/>
  video, church, flowers, his tuxedo, my son&#39;s little tuxedo, and<br/>
  plenty food.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Don&#39;t Quit<br/>
<br/>
  When things go wrong and they sometimes will,<br/>
  When the road you&#39;re trudging seems all uphill,<br/>
  When funds are low and debts are high,<br/>
  And you want to smile but only sigh,<br/>
  When care is pressing you down a bit,<br/>
  Rest if you must, but don&#39;t you quit.<br/>
<br/>
  Life is strange with its twists and turns,<br/>
  As every one of us sometimes learns,<br/>
  And many a failure turns about,<br/>
  When he might have won had he stuck it out,<br/>
  Don&#39;t give up though the pace seems slow,<br/>
  You may succeed with another blow.<br/>
<br/>
  Success is failure turned inside out,<br/>
  The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br/>
  And you can never tell how close you are,<br/>
  It seems so near when it seems so far;<br/>
  So stick to the fight when hardest hit,<br/>
  It&#39;s when things go wrong that you must not quit.<br/>
