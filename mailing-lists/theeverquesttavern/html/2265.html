<div id="ygrps-yiv-286599035">I wouldn&#39;t worry - they probably haven&#39;t deleted<br/>
your characters yet. By all accounts, that&#39;s the rule,<br/>
but they rarely actually do it; it&#39;s there to reserve<br/>
themselves the right to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But don&#39;t blame me if<br/>
your characters are gone when you resubscribe . .<br/>
.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if they are gone, you&#39;re going to have to start<br/>
from scratch. Can&#39;t get characters created at what<br/>
level you were at -- how could they confirm that, if<br/>
your characters have been deleted? &quot;Yeah, I was, um,<br/>
60th level. That&#39;s it, yeah.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
