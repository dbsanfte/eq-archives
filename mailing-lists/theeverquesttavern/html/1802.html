<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108865953">Yeah! Preach it brother! Druids suck arse!&lt;br&gt;But<br/>
then that coming from a necro played by a 13 year old<br/>
kid doesn&#39;t really make me think much of necros (or<br/>
13 year old males with a DragonballZ fetish, for<br/>

elsewise I might believe that one of the classes were no<br/>
good. &lt;shrugs&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Chief<br/>
