<div id="ygrps-yiv-822685278">hey that&#39;s because we Dark Elfs look better :) oh<br/>
and ogres are just sooo cuddly :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another<br/>
thing though... Why o why can&#39;t Half Elfs wear small<br/>
armour???? High Elfs CAN and they are as big as humans, when<br/>
Half Elves are SMALLER!! this has been bugging me<br/>
eversince I started playing... :) weird if you ask me...</div>
