<div id="ygrps-yiv-718164174">Ok, I have been playing EQ for about a year, and I feel that I have a <br/>
pretty good grasp on what is going on.  I have a 32 wizard, a 27 <br/>
warrior, 21 monk, 16 cleric, and 10 shaman (probably 11 by the time <br/>
you guys respond to this).  I just have a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
1.  When casting a spell, the spell type (evocation for nukes, <br/>
Conjuratoin for summoning, etc.) effects weather you fizzle or not, <br/>
for the most part and chanelling effects if your spell is inturpted <br/>
or resited, to a point.  Right?<br/>
<br/>
2.  I know there are a lot of really good INT gear out there.  But <br/>
what is some good shaman gear?  I have gone to bazaar and bought him <br/>
a Spine Chill Spear (10:28 3agi 6wis 10svcold, i think) and a 3wis <br/>
ring, but what else could I get him.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Where can I go with my wizard?  the level 32 one.  I got board of <br/>
HK and I am floating around now just wondering where to go.  I am <br/>
just porting and getting money atm, but i want to get to level 34 and <br/>
39 to get the rest of my port spells.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
