<div id="ygrps-yiv-576134293">Hehe . . . Yeah, I&#39;m not gonna re-type all that.<br/>
Just gives me something to do at work<br/>
sometimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we can continue the discussion, this time be<br/>
answering Shooman&#39;s post on groups. As I said, I&#39;ve been on<br/>
Kunark in Lake of Ill Omen -- Kunark is the first<br/>
expansion, right? Then Velious? (I would buy the expansions<br/>
if you plan on playing anything longer than two or<br/>
three months. You&#39;ll end up wanting to do stuff with<br/>
colors of text, windows, etc., and Velious allows that.<br/>
And then you&#39;ll be wanting to go see Lizards, so<br/>
you&#39;ll need Kunark. Not that you couldn&#39;t spend your<br/>
entire life on Antonica, Faydwer and Odus, the original<br/>
continents.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, groups. Groups are a (sometimes) fun fact of life<br/>
in EQ. Usually you have a tank (warrior, monk,<br/>
rogue) or two -- real tanks with armor (warriors) work<br/>
best, but Rangers and/or Paladins will do. Then you&#39;ll<br/>
want a healer -- Cleric, Druid, or Shaman. And some<br/>
casters -- a Wizard, Mage, Necro or Enchanter. Chanters<br/>
rock. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My tank lately has been a 26 level<br/>
Paladin. Last night we had no healers, just offense: the<br/>
paladin, me, a ranger, a necromancer and a Wizard.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it was fun -- we were fighting in the goblin<br/>
caves in LOIO, where I&#39;d died the night before, and<br/>
only once did I really feel we were in slight trouble.<br/>
The Necro&#39;s pet and the the wizard tended to take<br/>
care of adds, so that worked well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;3) 2<br/>
tanks? One definately should have peeled &lt;br&gt;&gt;off.<br/>
Secondary tank always peels and gets what &lt;br&gt;&gt;goes off<br/>
to the cleric&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve found that rogues are good<br/>
for this - since we&#39;re behind the MoB you&#39;re<br/>
fighting, it&#39;s often pretty easy for me to see adds or<br/>
MoB&#39;s that attack the casters. Backstab works fairly as<br/>
a taunt . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;6) Errr... there&#39;s a LOT<br/>
of ways to deal with &lt;br&gt;&gt;adds. Mezz, kite, fear,<br/>
root works really well&lt;br&gt;&gt;if the others don&#39;t,<br/>
Wizard area affect snare &lt;br&gt;&gt;and area affect bomb<br/>
works well too, Pets work &lt;br&gt;&gt;really well, multiple<br/>
tanks for multiple mobs &lt;br&gt;&gt;if they peel to healer,<br/>
etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I came to love the Necro&#39;s pet. Let it fight the<br/>
add and take one for the team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yes, we do<br/>
miss you, Shooman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
