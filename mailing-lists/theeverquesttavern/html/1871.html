<div id="ygrps-yiv-376166652">I&#39;ve never really liked twinks, but never though<br/>
to ask &quot;why?&quot; After thinking about it, they don&#39;t<br/>
make me as mad as before. Why twink? If it&#39;s to get<br/>
through the &quot;low&quot; levels and get to the high levels<br/>
quicker, then go for it. I won&#39;t, because I like to enjoy<br/>
each level. And if you twink and go, I probably won&#39;t<br/>
have to experience you for very long anyway. If it&#39;s<br/>
to run around Crushbone and shout, lvl 8 druid with<br/>
200WIS LFG, then just stay home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To me, MAJOR<br/>
twinking is like cheating. It&#39;s like cheat codes in some<br/>
games, or reading the back of the book. Getting<br/>
something that someone else doesn&#39;t have to make you better<br/>
than the rest. If you don&#39;t have the patience or<br/>
ability to do it yourself, the regular way, then I don&#39;t<br/>
have time for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT-- here are a few things<br/>
I don&#39;t mind: If you twink to get to lvl 20 because<br/>
all your friends are higher level and you want to<br/>
group with them--what&#39;s the harm? You hurt yourself<br/>
because you don&#39;t enjoy the lower levels and you probably<br/>
don&#39;t have enough experience to be a great player if<br/>
you rushed through the levels. Also, minor twinks are<br/>
just part of EQ society-- get a piece of<br/>
armor/weapon/item for being a good person, no harm in that. At lvl<br/>
10, I was given a velium mace from a guy who had gone<br/>
to Velius for the first time-- not a great weapon,<br/>
though better than what i had. It was cool. I was still<br/>
in mostly leather armore (with some tattered still,<br/>
i think). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an aside-- my guild does not<br/>
Twink our members. We will offer high end items at<br/>
discound rates, but will not equip lower level members<br/>
with all the best stuff-- and our members like it that<br/>
way. I remember getting an item that cost about 800pp<br/>
from a guildmate-- i had only about 500pp in the bank<br/>
total, and i handed over every last pp in the bank for<br/>
the item. Took me awhile to recover from that, but I<br/>
had the item and had paid a price for it. Twinking?<br/>
maybe-- harmful? I don&#39;t think so. I could have farmed<br/>
Mammoth tusks for a week to get the actualy money, but<br/>
instead I was out helping guildmembers and others, and<br/>
leaving the mammys for others (who can get good xp for<br/>
them) to hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/rambling off&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
