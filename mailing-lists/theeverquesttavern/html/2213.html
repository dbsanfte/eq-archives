<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953719072">Reminds me of my start in EQ. I spent the better<br/>
part of the first night trying to get a name through<br/>
the the approval process. In my frustration, I made a<br/>
female character and tried. I got the name approved on<br/>
the first try. I was just elated to get into the game<br/>
that I didn&#39;t care what I was. As for gifts, she<br/>
didn&#39;t get any. Didn&#39;t matter to me either. Later on,<br/>
she was given some nice items that were good into her<br/>
low teens. A friend said that I was only given those<br/>
items because I was playing a female. So I bet him that<br/>
he was wrong.&lt;br&gt;I went and created a male half elf<br/>
warrior in Freeport. Within 5 minutes of appearing in the<br/>
city, I was approached and asked if I was a good<br/>
person. I said yes. I was then given a minotaur bp and a<br/>
2handed sword (either lammy or langsaxe, can&#39;t remember<br/>
which). I did not beg nor ask for anything. I considered<br/>
myself lucky. My friend was p.o&#39;d though. hehe&lt;br&gt;As for<br/>
me, if I have extra and feel like it, and haven&#39;t<br/>
been hounded for stuff, I do give things away.<br/>
Sometimes I ask for minor things in return, like a<br/>
spiderling silk or bat wing. &lt;br&gt;My warrior who has mainly<br/>
war only stuff or no drop, is always hit for items. I<br/>
had to ask one guy (7th level dwarf cleric in<br/>
Rivervale) what part of warrior only did he not<br/>
understand?&lt;br&gt;Bottom line (for me) Beg and ye shall get naught. Be<br/>
kind and I may loosen my bank doors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye<br/>
