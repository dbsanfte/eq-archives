&gt; &gt; Witches school casts spell on Alps<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Tue Oct 8,10:23 PM ET<br/>
&gt; &gt; By Julia Ferguson <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; KLAGENFURT, Austria (Reuters) - You won&#39;t learn<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; to fly a <br/>
&gt; &gt; broomstick or cast spells with the flick of a<br/>
&gt; wand,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but a potent dose <br/>
&gt; &gt; of grit and study will turn you into a witch,<br/>
&gt; &gt; promises Europe&#39;s first <br/>
&gt; &gt; School of Witchcraft. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The school in the southern Austrian city of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Klagenfurt might sound <br/>
&gt; &gt; hocus-pocus, but those looking to emulate<br/>
&gt; fictional<br/>
&gt; &gt; young wizard <br/>
&gt; &gt; Harry Potter (news - web sites) will be a mite<br/>
&gt; &gt; disappointed: the <br/>
&gt; &gt; curriculum is downright scientific, and eye of<br/>
&gt; newt<br/>
&gt; &gt; is nowhere to be <br/>
&gt; &gt; seen. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Headmaster Andreas Starchel, who prefers to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; called by his druid <br/>
&gt; &gt; name Danaketh, said he established the school to<br/>
&gt; &gt; demystify witchcraft <br/>
&gt; &gt; by explaining phenomena using scientific methods<br/>
&gt; &gt; from physics, <br/>
&gt; &gt; chemistry, and biology. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Everything that is taught and learned at our<br/>
&gt; school<br/>
&gt; &gt; can be proven <br/>
&gt; &gt; using natural scientific and psychological<br/>
&gt; methods,&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; he told Reuters <br/>
&gt; &gt; during a training session in the woods. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;We teach everything needed to become a real witch<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the historical <br/>
&gt; &gt; sense -- that is to have an all-encompassing<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowledge of nature and <br/>
&gt; &gt; a highly developed sense of intuition. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Being a witch is not inborn. Anyone can learn to<br/>
&gt; &gt; become one,&quot; he <br/>
&gt; &gt; added. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Practitioners of witchcraft focus on the good in<br/>
&gt; &gt; life and the spirit, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and reject any connection with the devil, Starchel<br/>
&gt; &gt; said. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Since their beliefs date back to ancient times<br/>
&gt; well<br/>
&gt; &gt; before the birth <br/>
&gt; &gt; of Jesus, witchcraft has no bond with the<br/>
&gt; Christian<br/>
&gt; &gt; embodiment of <br/>
&gt; &gt; evil. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Witchcraft has got absolutely nothing to do with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the folklore image <br/>
&gt; &gt; of evil witches with green faces and warts on<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; nose. It&#39;s about <br/>
&gt; &gt; becoming a rounded person who lives in harmony<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; nature,&quot; said the <br/>
&gt; &gt; goatee-bearded druid. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; NO HOCUS-POCUS NOR HUNKUM BUNKUM <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The headmaster stressed that his school,<br/>
&gt; established<br/>
&gt; &gt; in 1998 for <br/>
&gt; &gt; wannabe witches and druids of 18 years and above,<br/>
&gt; &gt; has no ties with <br/>
&gt; &gt; religious organisations nor follows any esoteric<br/>
&gt; &gt; movement. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The syllabus originally lasted three years but has<br/>
&gt; &gt; now been revised <br/>
&gt; &gt; to a more flexible form to suit students&#39; busy<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; schedules. In a <br/>
&gt; &gt; sign of the times, it teaches courses over the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Internet as most of <br/>
&gt; &gt; its students live outside Austria. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; A student graduates with a venefica or veneficus<br/>
&gt; &gt; (from the Latin for <br/>
&gt; &gt; witch/druid) certificate after passing written<br/>
&gt; exams<br/>
&gt; &gt; in seven modules <br/>
&gt; &gt; and submitting a final thesis. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The first module focuses on awakening intuition,<br/>
&gt; &gt; specifically on how <br/>
&gt; &gt; to find sources of energy in nature and how to<br/>
&gt; &gt; channel it. Other <br/>
&gt; &gt; modules are astronomy, astrology, botany, holistic<br/>
&gt; &gt; healing and ritual <br/>
&gt; &gt; magic. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Curriculum information on the school website<br/>
&gt; &gt; www.hexen-schule.de <br/>
&gt; &gt; shows there are no modules like the Defence<br/>
&gt; Against<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Dark Arts <br/>
&gt; &gt; class which Harry Potter had to take in the<br/>
&gt; Hogwarts<br/>
&gt; &gt; School of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Some wannabe witches and druids are turned off<br/>
&gt; &gt; enrolling with us <br/>
&gt; &gt; when we tell them that our aim is to demystify<br/>
&gt; &gt; witchcraft,&quot; said <br/>
&gt; &gt; Starchel, who is an information technology<br/>
&gt; &gt; specialist by profession. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;People do approach us hoping to learn how to fly<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; a broomstick. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Then we have to disappoint them and explain that<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s much more <br/>
&gt; &gt; important to let the spirit fly -- to be able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; combine intellect <br/>
&gt; &gt; with the soul.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The school has received a huge fillip from the<br/>
&gt; Harry<br/>
&gt; &gt; Potter books by <br/>
&gt; &gt; J.K. Rowling (news - web sites) and television<br/>
&gt; &gt; series such as Sabrina <br/>
&gt; &gt; the Teenage Witch. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;We actually had kids phoning up asking whether<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; could ditch <br/>
&gt; &gt; their school and enrol with us,&quot; Starchel said. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; THE WITCHES OF KLAGENFURT <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Student witch Katharina, a bespectacled<br/>
&gt; middle-aged<br/>
&gt; &gt; librarian by day <br/>
&gt; &gt; who asked to be identified only by her witch name,<br/>
&gt; &gt; said she was drawn <br/>
&gt; &gt; to the course because something was missing from<br/>
&gt; her<br/>
&gt; &gt; life. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;I was looking for direction. Christianity was too<br/>
&gt; &gt; narrow for me and <br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t give me the answers I needed,&quot; she said<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; completing a <br/>
&gt; &gt; session of chakra meditation with Danaketh. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Chakras are the seven key energy centres of the<br/>
&gt; body<br/>
&gt; &gt; according to <br/>
&gt; &gt; Indian medicine. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;I was a bit sceptical at first but what impressed<br/>
&gt; &gt; me is that it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; not about belief or faith as in the church. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; school offers <br/>
&gt; &gt; plausible explanations for phenomena based on fact<br/>
&gt; &gt; -- there&#39;s no <br/>
&gt; &gt; hocus-pocus,&quot; Katharina said. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Katharina, who travels from Salzburg in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; northwest of the country <br/>
&gt; &gt; to attend the school&#39;s seminars, proudly shows off<br/>
&gt; &gt; an array of <br/>
&gt; &gt; bottles, vials and flasks with home-brewed<br/>
&gt; potions,<br/>
&gt; &gt; elixirs and <br/>
&gt; &gt; fragrant creams with which she treats her friends.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;At first my friends and family ridiculed me for<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanting to become a <br/>
&gt; &gt; witch. But now they come to me for one of my<br/>
&gt; potions<br/>
&gt; &gt; to soothe a <br/>
&gt; &gt; cough or whatever,&quot; she said. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Like Katharina, aspiring witch Saltah embraced the<br/>
&gt; &gt; craft three years <br/>
&gt; &gt; ago due to a thirst for knowledge. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;It started off as curiosity about mushrooms and<br/>
&gt; &gt; herbs, but then I <br/>
&gt; &gt; realised that I simply wanted answers to so many<br/>
&gt; &gt; things I couldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; comprehend and that this school could provide me<br/>
&gt; &gt; with them,&quot; said <br/>
&gt; &gt; Saltah, who is in her mid-20s. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Both women said the course was challenging<br/>
&gt; &gt; intellectually as <br/>
&gt; &gt; witchcraft covered a swath of subjects. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Just learning and completing the syllabus doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; make you a witch. <br/>
&gt; &gt; You&#39;ve got to work at it day in day out,&quot; Saltah<br/>
&gt; &gt; said. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s going to take me another 20 years before I<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; truly call <br/>
&gt; &gt; myself a witch,&quot; said Katharina, hunched over a<br/>
&gt; &gt; toadstool. <br/>
