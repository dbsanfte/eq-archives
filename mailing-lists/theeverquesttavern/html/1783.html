<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103903515">Listen very closely:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a fellow melee<br/>
class, I can understand, if just a bit, where you&#39;re<br/>
coming from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you&#39;re a bit inexperienced in<br/>
EQ, which is quite obvious with your<br/>
&quot;rant.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you are THAT low on life, the best thing you can<br/>
hope for is that your healer gets a spell off.<br/>
Because, like it or not, the mob is aggro&#39;d on you<br/>
COMPLETELY. No matter what anyone else does, short of a mem<br/>
blur, it&#39;s not going to stop attacking you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As<br/>
to the caster medding through combat: give me a<br/>
break. That&#39;s what casters do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;d like to know<br/>
what server you play on, and what your character&#39;s<br/>
name is. That way, I can avoid a piss-poor player who<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand how to play the game.</div>
