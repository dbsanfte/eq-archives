<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459614664">try to get a screaming mace or a fine steel mace.<br/>
the fs mace will run you about 4-5pp. do not pay more<br/>
than that since vendors buy them from players around<br/>
3-4pp. the screaming mace will cost you quite a bit more<br/>
and may be out of your reach for quite awhile unless<br/>
you are twinked. the really good one handed blunts<br/>
start at around 1k pp. you might give some thought to<br/>
changing over to a piercing weapon though. our epic is a<br/>
very nice spear, the spear of fate.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;personally, i wouldn&#39;t spend much money on anything that<br/>
doesn&#39;t give you a wisdom bonous. in a few more levels<br/>
you will be doing far more damage with your spells<br/>
than with weapons. my shaman is currently a level 35<br/>
and can cast a 253 pts direct damage spell 9 times<br/>
before running out of mana. her slime coated spear only<br/>
does 22 pts for one hit. once you get root you will<br/>
not need the club as much. the only time i enter<br/>
combat any more is just to practice my combat skills or<br/>
until i can re-root. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;elryche</div>
