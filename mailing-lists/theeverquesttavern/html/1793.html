<div id="ygrps-yiv-320554716">Death is such a fundamental part of EQ life-- i<br/>
think that goes double for Unrest. My record is 4<br/>
deaths in on session there. I played a foolhearty mage,<br/>
and would constantly send my earth pet into battle<br/>
with each mob of a train-- having it taunt and<br/>
temporarily root so that my party could get away. Many times<br/>
this worked, and everyone would make it to the zone<br/>
with my pet valiantly fighting 3 or 4 mobs outside of<br/>
the RR, while we all fled to safety--sometimes<br/>
regrouping at the CY or zone to see if we could pull off a<br/>
victory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many more times, though, my pet would die<br/>
suddenly while i was still &quot;puppeting&quot; it (using back off<br/>
and attack commands to keep all mobs engaged on the<br/>
pet), and all mobs would agro on me. Once this happens<br/>
i would either 1) get luck and be able to flee to<br/>
the zone, 2) get swarmed and die quickly because my<br/>
little gnome mage body can&#39;t take that abuse, 3) get<br/>
ghoul rooted and try desperately to gate away--usually<br/>
in vain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve since gotten much better at<br/>
the &quot;Mage evac&quot; rountine-- have once kept 6 Lizards<br/>
agrod on my pet while my party fled the TR in CT. Few<br/>
necros and mages i&#39;ve met have mastered this tactic, as<br/>
it is not easy--but if you don&#39;t have SOW or another<br/>
way to create saftey when in danger-- the sacrificial<br/>
bet works great. I&#39;m not sure if a necro could do it<br/>
was well as the mage with an earth pet, though--<br/>
earth pet can take a lot of damage and it&#39;s combo of<br/>
taunting and rooting helps a lot--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK-- long story<br/>
over-- points are: 1. we all die-- hopefully we learn<br/>
from it and get better, 2. Unrest is a cruel mistress,<br/>
3. why does everyone from upstairs have to train<br/>
down through the RR?? I always made a point of going<br/>
through the front door so as to not mess up the RR and<br/>
Porch groups-- sure it&#39;s a bigger train, but if you&#39;re<br/>
going to train, might as well make the MOST of it!! 4.<br/>
Don&#39;t death beetles suck? I was so happy when I could<br/>
finally fight safely inside the mansion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have a<br/>
good playing weekend-- going to hit 32 this weekend<br/>
AND up my tailoring and smithing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
