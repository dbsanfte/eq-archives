<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412695319">There is very, very few GOOD monks out there.<br/>
Guess most I have seen start trains then Feign death.<br/>
When it looks like it might that is might get bad they<br/>
Feign death or end up using Feign death during the<br/>
whole fight. arg! guess you either like certain monks<br/>
or you hate them just like clerics. Ones who know<br/>
how to play & those that don&#39;t. (hehe it&#39;s funny to<br/>
see a male monk practicing w/shirt off acting like<br/>
he&#39;s Jackie Chan).</div>
