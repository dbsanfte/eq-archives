<div id="ygrps-yiv-235023019">Finally -- got the software, created my character<br/>
. . . and promptly died. It has to be a record of<br/>
some sort -- I think I lasted about 15 minutes before<br/>
dropping into a pool of water and drowning. Very<br/>
embarassing; someone told me later that you can&#39;t get out of<br/>
water while walking, only while running. Another good<br/>
reason to keep the RUN button on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s the<br/>
thing -- before I died, I had not had a chance to give<br/>
my guildmaster my introduction. Went searching for<br/>
my body, but /corpse said I have no corpses in this<br/>
zone (North or South Kaladim, since I have only a<br/>
vague idea of where I was when I drowned). Is this one<br/>
of those things that disappear if you die before you<br/>
use it? I still have the Book of Discord.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But<br/>
when I finally found the guild, I had my five points<br/>
for skill training, so it looks like I got something<br/>
out of the deal. A bit confusing, however; when I<br/>
tried to get a guild task, they didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
recognize me as a guild member. Hm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Very strange<br/>
things happen in this world. A gnome dodged in front of<br/>
me, turned, and cast a spell. (In Kaladim, on the<br/>
Drinal server.) I didn&#39;t really notice at first, and<br/>
then later it occurred to me that it was a &quot;courage&quot;<br/>
spell. Didn&#39;t get to use it, however. Was he just<br/>
burning a spell to make room for another?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One<br/>
Veranndas, perhaps a human rogue, was exceedingly kind and<br/>
generous, and I wish to say nice words on his behalf. He<br/>
learned of my plight, directed me to the guild, and then<br/>
gave me many items -- cape, wrist bracers, a face mask<br/>
-- before telling me to look him up when I reached<br/>
the 4th level. Very neat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, just before<br/>
making camp, a dwarf (cleric, perhaps) ran in front of<br/>
me and also started to spell-cast. Before I could<br/>
react -- poof! he was gone, I assume via teleportation.<br/>
I felt like he did it in front of me just so<br/>
someone could watch the pretty lights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Very<br/>
interesting world. Be back for more tonight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht<br/>
