<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198611727">Fellow adventurers....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I finally have made<br/>
it to my 4th season. I did not think i would make<br/>
it...due to double teamed be orc pawns...but today i made<br/>
it and i took on three of them 1 with a axe...i took<br/>
out two of them while another guy got the third. Hope<br/>
to see you in the woods. Farewell.....for<br/>
now!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Garedon&lt;br&gt;&quot;The forest lives in the elf, just as the elf lives in<br/>
the forest.&quot;</div>
