&gt; Question? I was just looking at some of the pics and I saw one that <br/>
&gt; said screen shots. How do you do those and where are they saved on <br/>
&gt; your comp? (I do remember them from when I did play I just never <br/>
took <br/>
&gt; any.) The Raven <br/>

&gt; P.S. Still waiting on word about housing....I think I&#39;ll go bug them <br/>
&gt; Monday after Bio and Soc. At least I did give them a few days before <br/>
&gt; I start to bug them! </span></blockquote></div>
