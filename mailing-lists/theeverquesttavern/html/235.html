<div id="ygrps-yiv-855025710">A little of this, a little of that =) You can<br/>
pretty much discuss or announce any interesting stuff<br/>
about EQ here and try to strike up a conversation with<br/>
other citizens of Norrath. Also, if you post up a<br/>
question about the game you will get some answers from<br/>
people, so it can be very useful. Basically, it is just a<br/>
place to gather some people with an interest in<br/>
EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trellan Hawksight, Wood Elf Ranger of 20 seasons</div>
