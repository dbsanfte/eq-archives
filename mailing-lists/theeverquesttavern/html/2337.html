<div id="ygrps-yiv-807554837">Yep. I would have to say there&#39;s something fishy<br/>
here too. Verant has specifically said that they&#39;re<br/>
not asking for passwords. And regardless of being<br/>
angry at Verant... most of their GM&#39;s don&#39;t have that<br/>
kind of power. There are a few GM&#39;s that can swing<br/>
that kind of thing-- but as I understand it... most<br/>
can&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And worse yet... once they have your password, they<br/>
have your account. They change your password and it&#39;s<br/>
essentially their account from then on. So even if it is<br/>
legit, I wouldn&#39;t risk it cause they could change my<br/>
password at anytime if I gave them my station name and<br/>
password.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatehue Prismatic&lt;br&gt;Catza Baby White<br/>
