Police Search For Daughter Of Teen Found Dead<br/>
<br/>
KENNEDALE, Texas, 12:29 p.m. CDT August 23, 2003 - Kennedale police held a<br/>
news conference Saturday at 10 a.m. to reveal more about the death of a<br/>
16-year-old girl. <br/>
 <br/>
18-month-old, Crystal Alisha. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Police turned their focus to the victim&#39;s daughter. They believe the<br/>
18-month-old girl was with her mother when her mother was last seen alive. <br/>
&quot;Even the family members that we contacted don&#39;t have any idea where she<br/>
might be,&quot; said Kennedale Police Chief Jim Rutledge. &quot;She was last seen in<br/>
Dallas with her mother in the early part of August. Investigators have been<br/>
working in that area of Dallas trying to locate the little girl, and now we<br/>
re asking the public for assistance.&quot; <br/>
Police found 16-year-old Christina Robletto of Dallas in the trunk of a<br/>
burgundy Mercury Grand Marquis on Tuesday. Now, they are trying to locate<br/>
the victim&#39;s 18-month-old daughter, Crystal Alisha. <br/>
The Police Department held the news conference to release a picture and<br/>
information about Crystal. <br/>
Rutledge said no family members are suspects at this time. <br/>
Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Crystal should call<br/>
authorities at (817) 478-5416.<br/>
