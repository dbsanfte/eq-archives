<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804637863">Not really : ) you&#39;ll probably be pretty poor for<br/>
a while, though if I were you i&#39;d go to kerra isle<br/>
and kill wisps. You can use the lightstones in a<br/>
great quest (yeah i know a quest : ) in north<br/>
karana.&lt;br&gt;if you give a greater lightstone to myrsilla at the<br/>
gypsy camp she&#39;ll give you a concordance of research<br/>
worth around 8 or 9 pp&lt;br&gt;If you give her a regular<br/>
lightstone you get another book which is worth a bit less,<br/>
but you do get exp for handing all of these things in<br/>
: )&lt;br&gt;at level 14 I made over 100pp and half a<br/>
level just by saving these stones up hehe&lt;br&gt;you do<br/>
need a magic weapon to fight wisps though,<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;theres also some quest in qeynos where you hand in a<br/>
gnoll fang to the captain of the guard and you get exp<br/>
and a moonstone, you can then trade the moonstone for<br/>
blackburrow stout at one of the inns, (i forget the guys<br/>
name, you&#39;ll have to look it up) but you can sell that<br/>
for a bit i think&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;hehe hope this helps a lil :<br/>
