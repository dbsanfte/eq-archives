Hey, I understand the Senior Thesis problem, so here<br/>
is a website with a great article talking about how 48<br/>
Hours trashed EQ.<br/>

In my experience, anyone who would be so afflicted by<br/>
the outcome of a game is not a terribly stable person<br/>
in the first place.  Everquest has actually helped me<br/>
save money for tuition, and has kept me out of trouble<br/>
as well.  I sit at home and play EverQuest for a few<br/>
hours every night.  With a starting cost of 9.95 for<br/>
the game, 12.95 a month for a pre-paid card (I hate<br/>
credit cards), I get the first month free, 19.99 a<br/>
month in internet services (which I would have anyway)<br/>
<br/>
Lets figure roughly how much I spend in a 4 month<br/>
period  79.96 internet  9.95 for the game and 38.85<br/>
for the card.  128.74  total spending on the game in a<br/>
4 month period.  <br/>
<br/>
   And, a little comparison.  7.50 movie ticket 5.00<br/>
small popcorn (highway robbery [the cost of movie<br/>
popcorn should be regulated =P ]) 12.50 x 5 nights a<br/>
week 62.50 a week.  Or for the more conservative (such<br/>
as myself) 5.95 for a new paperback book (I go through<br/>
about 4 of these a week when im not playing online). <br/>
5.95 x 4 23.80 per week.  The only way I could see<br/>
overcoming the savings seen here is to go to the<br/>
library.  The one in my town kinda sux so I don&#39;t very<br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
   On the other hand, It cuts you off from anything<br/>
social or deemed <br/>
<br/>
