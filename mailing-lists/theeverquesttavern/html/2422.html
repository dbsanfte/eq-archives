<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030345924">Hmm... Old world hunting eh? Good stuff...<br/>
sometimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try Crushbone, Blackburrow, or even the Warrens for a<br/>
while. For the mid-teens head to Oasis (although<br/>
lavastorm is good if you have a magic weapon, especially<br/>
for mages and druids anti-summon spells). Around 20,<br/>
southern Karana or Lake Rathe, or Everfrost (mammoths are<br/>
great cash). Around 30, you can start looking for<br/>
groups in Rathe Mtns, Soldunga, or even the Stonebrunt<br/>
Mtns. Around 40, just about anywhere is fair game,<br/>
though Nagafen&#39;s Lair is good, or Lower Guk has some<br/>
nice stuff in it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t forget Mistmoore<br/>
somewhere between 28/29 and 40 or so, pick up some<br/>
Mistmoore granite for Armor of Ro quests for your<br/>
paladin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adventure around, there&#39;s always stuff to kill.&lt;br&gt;I left<br/>
out the whole area around Highpass/Kithicor/the<br/>
gorge/runnyeye... all of it good stuff...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good<br/>
luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Tunare&#39;s Chosen of Karana&lt;br&gt;Chief<br/>
