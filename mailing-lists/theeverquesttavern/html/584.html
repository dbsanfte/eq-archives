<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584437211">hehe $400 ! wow that is just insane thank god i<br/>
have friends who can help for free. any ways the lower<br/>
levels are the best, good exp level fast, no exp lost<br/>
when dieing. and why pay some one to play your account<br/>
for you? you dont even get to enjoy the power<br/>
leveling yourself. but hey what ever floats your<br/>
boat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;is there anyone here from the veeshan server?? i<br/>
heard its like hell on that server,...so i created a<br/>
test char and the message of the day was &quot;every zone<br/>
and plane is open to all players please respect<br/>
others right to play ...if they meet the level<br/>
requirement&quot; what was that about?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elif :o)</div>
