<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-245377365">i know what you mean. i quite often pass out fine<br/>
steel weapons and free buffs to level 1 through 7 when<br/>
ever i go back to halas. i do not consider this<br/>
twinking or power leveling, more of a helping hand. some<br/>
one had done this to me when i first started to play<br/>
and i have never forgotten it. recently i had a level<br/>
5 shaman came up to me for buffs. i thought it look<br/>
like he had some nice stuff so i took a look. he had<br/>
better stuff than my 35 shaman. i explain to him that i<br/>
only help low levels that really needed it. he got<br/>
real mad and start shouting about what he thought of<br/>
me. he was so abusive that several other players<br/>
ended up petitioning. on the other hand, i had one low<br/>
level tell me to wait around for a little bit after<br/>
helping him. he brought on his level 56 and gave me a +8<br/>
wis and str veil. i do not consider that twinking,<br/>
more of a reward for doing good deeds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;elryche</div>
