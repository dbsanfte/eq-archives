<b>Subject:</b> Re: TWINKING-- a discussion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-91160961">I am a lev 21 Wiz, and I have only been playing<br/>
for about 2 months now. I havce come across many ppl<br/>
who were obviusly TWINKED. I have seen ppl that look<br/>
like they could take on DVinn solo, and yet I see them<br/>
running from an orc cent. I check their lev on the WHO<br/>
comand and find out that they are a lev &quot;2&quot;.<br/>
Unfortunatly I am bound by my honer not to let someone die if<br/>
I can help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I myself have receeved sertain<br/>
items at low lev like a Gossimer robe was given to me<br/>
at lev 5 or 6 when I was looking for a group by the<br/>
Cb cave next to the zone. Aparently a nice Wiz of<br/>
high lev had seen me fight to help another even know<br/>
that I too had to run and zone and took pitty on me. I<br/>
have also receeved things from good friends, I am not<br/>
sure how far off my lev theey are or if they are but,<br/>
I have mad a pact to do my best to get the money I<br/>
need for the things I get the hard way. I would not<br/>
even quest the CB belts so that I could sell them to<br/>
get the things that I would be able to use<br/>
later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as for the sex talk, well I have had my fill of<br/>
that as well. The stupid things ppl say when they get<br/>
bored or they just want to get a rise out of ppl is<br/>
outraguse. i was in Crushbone one time listing to an idiout<br/>
start to talk about how the orcs must be gay because<br/>
they have never seen a female orc. Needless to say he<br/>
got a lot of messages to shut up and let ppl play in<br/>
peace, but he alsop got just what he wanted which was<br/>
for ppl to lagh and to give him attention. I my self<br/>
just told him that they were &quot;A&quot; sexual and to stop<br/>
posting stupid stuff. He did not stop till a GM happened<br/>
to be in CB and cought him on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the<br/>
ladies, it has been my experiance that there are some<br/>
that feed into it insted of saying sometyhing to make<br/>
them stop. So in thoughs cases I realy do not feel<br/>
sorry for the. On the other hand if you are ever messed<br/>
with in game play like that an dthey will not stop, my<br/>
sugestion is to petition ASAP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for your<br/>
time--Remnoq Lev 21 Wiz High Elf.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ps. Sorry that I took<br/>
up so much room but I had a lot to say about this.</div>
