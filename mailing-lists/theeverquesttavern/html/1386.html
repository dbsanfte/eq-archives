<div id="ygrps-yiv-260304151">1) I&#39;m always running unless in a tight space. I<br/>
have the set run option in my eqclient.ini file set to<br/>
true. I walk only to tightrope on<br/>
catwalk--etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Before you die... try to /loc. /loc command gives<br/>
you your location. North makes the first number go<br/>
negative, south positive. East negative second number, West<br/>
positive. Easy as that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) There&#39;s a guild note you<br/>
want to give to your guild master for some exp and a<br/>
new player freebie item. Unfortunately, it probably<br/>
was lost with your corpse. However, if someone gave<br/>
you all that equipment... it&#39;s too much of a loss to<br/>
delete and start all over again. LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Right<br/>
clicking and holding over an icon will tell you what it&#39;s<br/>
for. Magic cast on you usually is a buff aka stat<br/>
increaser. Look at your stats and green stats have been<br/>
magically increased.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone probably was being nice<br/>
and giving you a buff to help a new player.<br/>
