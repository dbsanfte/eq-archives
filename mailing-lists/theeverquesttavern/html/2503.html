<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088198347">A few things:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) The Lake Rathe<br/>
gnolls/undead right next to the SK zone line-- ahh. Brings back<br/>
memories. A few friends and I used to own that place.<br/>
LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s an easy spot to kill at actually with a good<br/>
group. Usually when Aviaks get over camped, that&#39;s where<br/>
we&#39;d head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best part about it is it drops a<br/>
few low level magical weapons. Definately, you can<br/>
get lots better but my druid appreciated the dropped<br/>
staff there. Or is my memory just fuzzy. There&#39;s also a<br/>
gnoll in SK that runs around with a magic staff that<br/>
gives like +5 mana too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) SK and the Arena.<br/>
Get acquainted with those areas. Arena is a PVP zone.<br/>
The reason you want to know that zone is cause it is<br/>
considered a &quot;city&quot;. Melee people can bind in there and it&#39;s<br/>
just a short swim to Arena from SK zone/Lake Rathe<br/>
zone line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That way if something goes wrong,<br/>
ya&#39;ll don&#39;t have to wait ages for your melee to get<br/>
back. It&#39;s also a good way to build up swimming which<br/>
is good to have in certain zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) &quot;You can<br/>
kill annoying little shorties like Rondo Dunfire and<br/>
that little gnome in the pit (what&#39;s his name<br/>
again??).&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dunfire is okay. I don&#39;t mind killing him<br/>
b/c he only gives you bad faction with Rogues and a<br/>
few other people. I forget exactly. But Rhelog (sp?)<br/>
the gnome guy. I can&#39;t believe I forget his name<br/>
cause he&#39;s so annoying-- hate him, would love to kill<br/>
him--but don&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? Cause I&#39;m afraid of the<br/>
negative gnome faction he gives out. I could be wrong or<br/>
they might have changed it. But two years ago, he gave<br/>
out some nasty Gnome City faction. I haven&#39;t been<br/>
there in forever but Steamfont is a gate I use from<br/>
time to time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Course if you&#39;re one of the many<br/>
that love to kill Gnome guards cause they&#39;re decent<br/>
exp and loot at that level... then don&#39;t worry.<br/>
Forget what levels those guards are since I never attack<br/>
poor innocent guards protecting cities. (well other<br/>
than say Centaurs or stuff that don&#39;t seem to<br/>
acknowledge my killing off their members. ROFL. If they don&#39;t<br/>
care, why should I?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
