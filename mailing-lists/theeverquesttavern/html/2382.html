<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986758453">Sorry, not on Quellious . . . but wanted to point<br/>
out that if you&#39;re in Butcherblock, you&#39;re in the<br/>
same zone as the docks with the boats to Freeport. No<br/>
need to go into the Dwarf city (Kaladim), although<br/>
it&#39;s an awful nice place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Depending where<br/>
you&#39;re at in Butcherblock, to find the docks: If you&#39;ve<br/>
just zoned in from Kelethin/Greater Faydark, take the<br/>
road in front of you. You&#39;ll pass between some huts<br/>
with no guards, then come to one with three armored<br/>
Dwarves around or inside of it. Turn right -- this is<br/>
commonly known as the crossroads. Then just follow this<br/>
all the way north, and you&#39;ll come to Kaladim,<br/>
passing two or three more huts with guards. Either go<br/>
into Kaladim, or keep running on the path past<br/>
Kaladim, and you&#39;ll eventually come to the docks.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just watch for the Aqua Goblins coming out of the<br/>
water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht&lt;br&gt;Rogue of 27-odd seasons&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
