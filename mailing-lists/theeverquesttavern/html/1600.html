<div id="ygrps-yiv-491540830">Hoo boy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen quite<br/>
this much false info flung around in quite a while.<br/>
I&#39;ll see what I can do to repair it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. You do<br/>
not begin to lose XP until 6th level. As it is, you<br/>
can&#39;t drop below 6th level. That would mean XP loss in<br/>
the 5th level, which is impossible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Skills<br/>
are only &quot;lost&quot; if you drop more than two levels. For<br/>
instance, someone &quot;delevels&quot; (attacks a high level mob over<br/>
and over, dying over and over, and losing XP over and<br/>
over until they drop in level) from 54 to 26. Their<br/>
skills drop until they using them at the max of 28th<br/>
level. However, when that person regains 27, their skill<br/>
automatically jumps to the max of 29. This will continue until<br/>
they&#39;ve regained the level they originally<br/>
lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Healing, buffing, or otherwise casting beneficial<br/>
spells on ANY mobs does NOT work. Healing a wolf while<br/>
some newbie is fighting it might scare them off, but<br/>
in reality it isn&#39;t doing anything at all. This was<br/>
put into place to prevent both XP kills and to keep<br/>
high level characters from buffing out Orc Pawns and<br/>
watching them murder newbies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. There are RUMORS<br/>
of hidden faction when killing bears or wolves, but<br/>
they are just that. Rumors. I&#39;ve killed hundreds of<br/>
bears AND wolves, as a ranger, and my faction with<br/>
Jaggedpine Treefolk and such hasn&#39;t changed a<br/>
bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this clears a few things up for you<br/>
all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral Stormfang&lt;br&gt;Captain of the Knights of<br/>
