Did you already choose a server, class, race etc.??<br/>
<br/>
Just curious-- I&#39;m one of those that took a little bit of playing and <br/>
creating new chars. before I found my &quot;main.&quot;  Not has bad as some <br/>
who&#39;ve played 20 chars to lvl 7.  In fact, my highest char is stuck <br/>
at lv 40 because I found that I love the rogue class and am devoting <br/>
all my time to this &quot;alt.&quot;  He&#39;s lvl 31 already. Never thought i&#39;d <br/>
live a dwarf, but Rumbl is pretty kewl.  His beard was a nice red <br/>
color until he went to Unrest-- Undead affected him severely, and now <br/>
his beard is white.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck getting in game!!<br/>
