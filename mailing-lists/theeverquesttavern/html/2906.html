<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869925496">The good news is that the skeletal excavator&#39;s you have to kill to <br/>
get the foreman to pop are found on the first floor. They are not <br/>
behind any doors, so it&#39;s just a good ol&#39; find &#39;em and whack &#39;em <br/>
event. When the foreman pops, he does a zone wide saying and appears <br/>
towards the back on the first level, between the two skulls in the <br/>
wall. Kill him and Sir A will spawn in the same spot. <br/>
<br/>
Befallen is decent. I still visit it with my 28 war once in a while. <br/>
On the way to the 2nd level, that is when you will find much more <br/>
sks, necros, and mummies. They will swarm you. But since this quest <br/>
can be done with out going down there or through any doors, you <br/>
should be fine. <br/>
