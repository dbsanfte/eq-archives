<div id="ygrps-yiv-611978435">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I need some help on my next MPORPG purchase. I played EQ since Beta <br/>
and quit about 2 and half years ago (college took priority heh) and <br/>
now that I have secured a somewhat stable career, I&#39;m planning to hit <br/>
online RPGing again. Question is, being that EQ has been out for 5 <br/>
years, is it too late to come back and start anew? Meaning am I going <br/>
to look ridiculous (prolly will regardless) being the only lvl 6 guy <br/>
on the server in cloth and using fine steel? Realistically, I&#39;m <br/>
assuming after all of these years a large percentage of the players <br/>
have either progressed to upper echelon in levels, or populated with <br/>
tweeked alternates. Should I be looking at another MPORPG like <br/>
Camelot (a bit more recent)? Suggestions are appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
