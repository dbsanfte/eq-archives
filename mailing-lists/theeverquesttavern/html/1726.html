<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497083681">Warrens is way far away from my neck of the woods<br/>
(Faydwer). I&#39;ve been living in Unrest for the last six<br/>
levels or so. Very fun place, but takes some getting<br/>
used to. Notorious trains, weird pathing, mainly<br/>
undead. Been getting a lot of FS and bronze weaps, lots<br/>
of runes for various casters&#39; spells. Also, if<br/>
you&#39;re a rogue, you can get lots of supplies for<br/>
poison-making -- zombie skins for vials, grave mold, Amanita<br/>
Phalloids, Dark Bone Marrow for the poisons themselves. And<br/>
the only source for a mortar and pestle in Faydwer is<br/>
(sort of) on the way, on the island in the lake in<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But again -- you must have a<br/>
group (and a good one) after about level 15. You&#39;ll be<br/>
able to solo the hedge, for example, but that gets<br/>
kind of old and slow after a while. Get someone who<br/>
knows what they&#39;re doing, and you&#39;ll get a level every<br/>
two days. Enjoyed it much more than<br/>
Crushbone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, there&#39;s no place like home for a bit of<br/>
variety. Lots of things to kill in Butcherblock Mountains,<br/>
and lots of guards and helpful PC&#39;s to help out if<br/>
you get in trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
