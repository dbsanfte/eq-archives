<b>Subject:</b> Hello fellow EQ visionaires <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-272567207">I&#39;m currently level 7 and very much a newbie.<br/>
Even after 7 levels I&#39;m learning something everytime I<br/>
turn around. I&#39;m currently located on the Bertox<br/>
server as Lilaciana and hoping to meet others in the<br/>
Greater Fay zone in which I can group up with or find a<br/>
guild that would except me. Looking forward to making<br/>
new friends here and learning more and more about the<br/>
game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank You&lt;br&gt;Lilac&#39;</div>
