<div id="ygrps-yiv-249875647">I found out about EQ one day when I was bored and<br/>
looked at a site with upcoming games. After a few<br/>
screenshots and the FAQ I was totally hooked and began<br/>
getting all of my friends obsessed too, hehe. I went nuts<br/>
waiting for it and then I was so happy when the game<br/>
itself was out a day early (Granted I couldn&#39;t play util<br/>
the next day...) So I sat and played the Tutorial<br/>
about 30 times and soon enough I finally got to play!<br/>
Of course, that&#39;s when the server prblems were and I<br/>
could only get a good hour in before they all went<br/>
down, but that&#39;s a whole otehr story. =)</div>
