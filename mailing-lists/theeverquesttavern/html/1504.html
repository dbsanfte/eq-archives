<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050568359">Actually, I don&#39;t think we dissagree at all. I am<br/>
also a teacher and a professional consultant who gives<br/>
presentations for a living. My point was not to use too many,<br/>
not that they shouldn&#39;t be used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea of<br/>
having a &quot;unique&quot; visual aid is a good one, just don&#39;t<br/>
spend all your five minutes trying to pull everyone&#39;s<br/>
attention away from your hand-outs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You want the<br/>
audience to listen to you, not focus on something you gave<br/>
them. Whatever visual aids you use, they should not<br/>
distract the audience from what you are saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The<br/>
wonderful thing about opinions is that pretty much everyone<br/>
has one. It was a great idea to solicit ideas on a<br/>
message board. You will probably learn as much from that<br/>
as from giving the presentation! RELAX, HAVE FUN and<br/>
GOOD LUCK! ;-)</div>
