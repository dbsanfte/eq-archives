<b>Subject:</b> EQ was down <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975214039">Have you seen the new changes to the zones last night??? Two servers <br/>
were still down and the GMs in chat were saying the lost all <br/>
characters, but, everything was fixed! <br/>
<br/>
I think it is an attempt to get people to re-visit the zones we <br/>
already have, and, give updates to people who don&#39;t buy the <br/>
expansions as well. Traps were added where they weren&#39;t before, some <br/>
mobs were given more AC and hitpoints, I think it is mainly for the <br/>
upcomming expansion (we both ordered ours). <br/>
<br/>
HAPPY HUNTING... and check out the quests, for those who are EXP <br/>
geared the quests have been updated and new ones added for those of <br/>
you who cruz other servers starting over again to make EQ fun again <br/>
(like I do). Starting over on a new server reminds you of what a TRUE <br/>
NEWBIE is... LMAO!<br/>
