<div id="ygrps-yiv-401200592">Hey all. I was just writing to let you know that<br/>
I have started a message board RPG called Final<br/>
Mystic (I know name is corny) I need a lot of members,<br/>
and we will start doing stories and the like. The<br/>
website is &lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/finalmystic">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/finalmystic</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/finalmystic&lt;/a">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/finalmystic&lt;/a</a>&gt; . So,<br/>
if you could, would you please go there and at least<br/>
think about joining, if not joining. If you do join,<br/>
plaese try and get other people. Thank you for your<br/>
cooperation.</div>
