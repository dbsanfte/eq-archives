<b>Subject:</b> Re: Question for highbies about dual wie <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579420063">As far as I can tell, the primary weapon goes off<br/>
on it&#39;s own, and the delay on the secondary weapon<br/>
helps determine how often you get an additional shot<br/>
with it. From my experience, it seems the primary<br/>
weapon always goes off first, followed by a chance for<br/>
double attack, then a chance for dual wield. &lt;br&gt;I think<br/>
that&#39;s how it goes anyway.</div>
