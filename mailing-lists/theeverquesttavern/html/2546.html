<div id="ygrps-yiv-413557244">Well it seems that my dreams of actually playinf EQ again may happen <br/>
a lot sooner than I had expected! I finally got the money I was <br/>
waiting for so I put my deposit down for the on-campus apartments. It <br/>
seems that there may be an opening by the end of this month if I want <br/>
it. (Yah like that&#39;s a question to ask me! Do I want it?! Yup you <br/>
betcha!) So keep your fingers crossed that I can actually move on <br/>
campus by the end of this month cause if I do...well...I&#39;ll be <br/>
playing by the middle of next month. *sigh* the last few weeks are <br/>
the hardest to wait for! The Raven</div>
