<div id="ygrps-yiv-198757066">WOOHOO!!! I finally got it! it took me about 2<br/>
weeks of constant camping, but it was worth it! As soon<br/>
as i got into the Assasin group he spawned and, and<br/>
had the mask. Since i was the only one not to have it<br/>
already in the group...I got it! The Stats on the mask<br/>
are Cha +14 magic +7, only bard/rogue can wear. BUT<br/>
when you right click on the mask it turns you into a<br/>
dark elf! Well im very happy. Just had to let you guys<br/>
know&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin 36th Brad, (somtimes dark elf) Minstrel of<br/>
Norrath on the Mithaniel Marr server&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ps sorry, i<br/>
