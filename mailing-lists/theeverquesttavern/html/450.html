<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260553703">ok my char Elif grew up in qeynos....the best way<br/>
to make money is to save everylittle crappy thing<br/>
that you loot...hunt down those decaying skeletons<br/>
with staffs...they are cracked staffs and sell for<br/>
about a plat&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;by lvl 8 i had moved my way into<br/>
blackburrow...at the middle of that lvl i had 40 pp to my<br/>
name&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;then i got to the lvl where willowisps are white and<br/>
blue to me....i got many lightstones and greater<br/>
lightstones (do the quest with them later when you can make<br/>
it through the karanas...good money)&lt;br&gt;and then i<br/>
just kept selling my loot everything i got. &lt;br&gt;when<br/>
you get up to his lvl kill gnasher furgut...and get<br/>
the medal of merit...+5<br/>
charisma&lt;br&gt;(quest)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and now im at lvl 26....in the last 2 days i made<br/>
234pp....:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;tip of the day : dont beg higher lvls for<br/>
stuff.....usually they will give you equipment if you just be nice<br/>
and maybe ask for a buff.. i know i do.....i dunno if<br/>
i left anything out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;oh and give bone chips<br/>
to lashun novashine...see how much exp you get 2 at<br/>
a time he will heal you ..no money but might be a<br/>
great way to lvl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;well im done<br/>
rambling&lt;br&gt;elif serabaar lvl 26 ranger cazic-thule<br/>
