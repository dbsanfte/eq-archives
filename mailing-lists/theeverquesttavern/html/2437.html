<div id="ygrps-yiv-70924349">Quests are long and entailed usually BUT they&#39;re<br/>
designed to try to get people to explore-- get a little<br/>
extra exp and some interesting items along the way.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, the Dwarves of Brell in my guild all<br/>
went and got themselves that item that you can right<br/>
click on and summon Ale (or some alcoholic beverage.<br/>
LOL)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
