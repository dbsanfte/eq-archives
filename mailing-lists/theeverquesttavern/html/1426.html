<div id="ygrps-yiv-720643640">OK -- a follow-up to my own post on this. Ran<br/>
across this on at Allakhazam (everquest.allakhazam.ocm)<br/>
in the Rogue strategy discussion. Someone got popped<br/>
by an Orc Legionnaire while hiding and recuperating<br/>
from a Griffin attack: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;LOL well First of all<br/>
u could have horrible fraction with ORCS. And<br/>
secondly aren&#39;t legionnaires RED to you. Hiding from<br/>
higher lvls isnt as successful as from things that con<br/>
BLUE and GREEN. Keep this in mind. The Griffin<br/>
probabaly would have killed u too if he got up close. If u<br/>
hunt ORC u pretty much have bad faction with them so<br/>
the orcs anywhere are aggro to u. Even orcs with<br/>
names. If it looks like an orc it hates<br/>
you!!!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That makes much more sense - but jeez, why don&#39;t they<br/>
tell you this at the guild hall?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
Kaladim&lt;br&gt;7th season Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
