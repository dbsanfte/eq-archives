<div id="ygrps-yiv-235381382">I figured out the PST, but at about midnight, people were <br/>
yelling &quot;GET OFF AT 12 Am PST&quot; and that really confused me.<br/>
<br/>
The faces are moved to the left side of the head, or down onto the <br/>
body of the character, not really sure if it is a bug or what, and it <br/>
even has the everquest staff confused so far. The only players that <br/>
have their faces still intact are the new cat creature things.<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that the texture is gone off of every animated thing, <br/>
but like water ex... It wasnt like that the last time I played EQ. <br/>
But, it still works and that is what matters.<br/>

&gt; No one has a face??? That&#39;s awfully odd. Not sure what might be at <br/>
&gt; issue there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as lingo, there&#39;s not much new I don&#39;t think except for two <br/>
&gt; acronyms. For some reason there&#39;s a new love for acronyms.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PST is no longer Pacific Standard Time. It&#39;s Please Send Tell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; LFG is looking for group. Which makes sense and is also a tag <br/>
command <br/>
&gt; you can use anyway. Course I think LFG may have first occurred on <br/>
&gt; servers about 8 months ago so you may already know that one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a lot of new Beastlord stuff and content, but that&#39;ll be <br/>
fun <br/>
&gt; for you to explore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Only really unobvious one is the command /tgb. This toggles on and <br/>
&gt; off Targetgroupbuff command which is the command to be able to cast <br/>
&gt; group buff spells on other groups.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS.. there&#39;s probably a LOT more but these are the most common off <br/>
&gt; the top of my head. Course I&#39;m druid so kinda biased. =) </span></blockquote></div>
