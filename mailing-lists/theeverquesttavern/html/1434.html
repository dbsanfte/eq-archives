<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650018263">The /con guide is burried in the players guide<br/>
for Kunark expansion (the one you buy seperately, not<br/>
the little thing that comes with the game). If you<br/>
don&#39;t have it, i recommend it. It has pretty good city<br/>
maps, race/class information, spell lists for each<br/>
caster at each level, skill info., a list of emotes (try<br/>
/boggle), and lots of other helpful info. I got it as a<br/>
gift to entice me to play the game. I read it for a<br/>
week, and was foaming at the mouth to get the game<br/>
afterwards. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the /con guide - - they seem to<br/>
hold true for me, but it&#39;s been awhile since the book<br/>
came out, so it may be a little different. From recent<br/>
experience though, the blue /con info seems true, and i am<br/>
getting more XP on the &quot;high blues&quot; based on the /con<br/>
message. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. -- I hide from Griffs very often in<br/>
NK, and they fly right over me (as I tremble and<br/>
sweat!!!). In fact, last night I hid when I saw GrimFeather<br/>
coming - and he went right by my, then attacked my<br/>
partner who failed to heed my warnings. As a lvl 17<br/>
ranger, he took 3 hits and then hit the ground. Grim<br/>
continued on to kill the 2 guards on the hill, and then few<br/>
right by me again. Maybe I have good GrimFeather<br/>
faction because I refrain from killing Griffs??? I don&#39;t<br/>
know and don&#39;t care, as long as he doesn&#39;t pick at my<br/>
entrails. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;17th season Druid&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>
