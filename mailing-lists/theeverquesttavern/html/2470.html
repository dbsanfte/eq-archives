<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664957498">I assume you are a good race, and trying to get<br/>
to LOIO from the FV compound. Here&#39;s the scoop--<br/>
Once you leave the compound and head north-west,<br/>
you&#39;ll get to that water fall. Above the waterfall<br/>
you&#39;ll be following the river all the way to the zone.<br/>
Drachnids infest the area, with an occasional gobbie or<br/>
leech. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOST drachnids cannot see invis or rogue<br/>
hide/sneak. But some can--- i have not figured out what<br/>
determines this (ie. level of mob, or type of drachnid--<br/>
though i&#39;m pretty sure that I have /con all different<br/>
types of Drachnids as indiff at one point or another).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s the best way to do it-- head to the waterfall.<br/>
Make sure you have SOW on and invis/camo up-- then<br/>
bolt for it. You can either just run as fast as you<br/>
can and hope that if you DO agro something, you&#39;ll<br/>
make it to the zone in time, or you can move slowly<br/>
and /con everything from a distance. The only problem<br/>
with this is that Drachnids have a nasty habit of just<br/>
poping out of thin air. I have died once on the way to<br/>
LOIO using either of these techniques. One time I<br/>
agrod a Drach and got poisoned while running to zone--<br/>
nearly died, but madly bound wounds till poison wore<br/>
off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dreadlands is not a nice place for<br/>
someone under lvl 35ish. I did this run several times<br/>
with my druid because I didn&#39;t want to boat to Kunark,<br/>
and it freaked me out everytime. Best way to do this<br/>
if you&#39;re foolish enough to try is to get SOW and<br/>
Levitate-- if you run from the snow capped mountains and<br/>
head 1) east toward Karnor&#39;s or 2) North-East to the<br/>
northern wall, you will probably not agro anything from<br/>
your height in the sky. If you do, you can get help<br/>
from the groups at Karnor&#39;s or the surrounding ruins.<br/>
If you headed north, you can zone to BW or FM.<br/>
That&#39;s the easy part, now you need to make your way<br/>
either to the FM zone and then dodge giants to the LOIO<br/>
zone, or you have to get to the FV zone and STILL run<br/>
the guantlet from FV to LOIO. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most things in<br/>
DL see through invis-- including giants (same ones<br/>
as in FM). I think more Drachnids in DL see through<br/>
invis, and they are mostly higher levels that those in<br/>
FV. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My god, I should wrap this up now...<br/>
hehe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck-- the dangerous run is there because the<br/>
rewards of xp in LOIO are soo good. On Xev LOIO is full<br/>
of /shout /ooc spam-- it seems more like a chat room<br/>
at times than a game, but you get to know a lot of<br/>
players there, and if you&#39;re smart, you&#39;ll /friend so you<br/>
can hook up at higher levels for better adventures!!</div>
