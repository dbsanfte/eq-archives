<b>Subject:</b> General advice for soloing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-470684415">Greetings all!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I purchased everquest with<br/>
the knowledge that I would have to solo most of the<br/>
time due to odd playing hours, family, yadda yadda<br/>
etc. etc. I decided on a Barb Shaman because I thought<br/>
they seemed like they could go it alone pretty well.<br/>
Recently strange and unforseen events have made me rethink<br/>
my decision and I am looking for some advice from my<br/>
fellow players (see sob story below)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was once a<br/>
non-twinked lvl 15 Shaman until I had a run in with an angry<br/>
Undead Reaver on my way up to Highhold Pass. Anyway,<br/>
during the fight, I was somehow knocked over the edge<br/>
and fell to my untimely demise. When I returned, I<br/>
was unable to locate my corpse. I found a friendly<br/>
Bard to help me locate, but still no good. I<br/>
petitioned for help and got no response (suprise, suprise).<br/>
Well to make a long story short I am now a naked lvl<br/>
14 Barbarian Shaman with 30pp in the bank and a<br/>
choice to make.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My question is should I continue<br/>
with the Shaman or maybe start anew with a different<br/>
class that might be easier to solo?</div>
