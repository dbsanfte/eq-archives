<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612742272">You sell them to merchants or other players. Depending on your <br/>
charisma score, race and faction, you can get a platinum for them. <br/>
For instance, if you&#39;re a wodd elf, odds are Linadian in West FP <br/>
will give you better prices than anyone else. Don&#39;t sell to Boomba <br/>
the Big unless you have to, he will rip you off, he gives around <br/>
half what the others give. The same is tru for the merchant at the <br/>
top of the orc lift in Kelethin and the merchant right outside of <br/>
Befallen.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree with the post for the most part except<br/>
&gt; &gt; for one addition. I&#39;d say you probably want to level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 12 and 13 through the NRO area using derv groups.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They drop some +2 dex rings than sometimes can sell<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a plat piece and make for a good low level ring<br/>
&gt; &gt; to wear. Plus they&#39;re good experience and make for<br/>
&gt; &gt; interesting group experience. It&#39;s a good place to meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; people before moving on to a much more hectic and faster<br/>
&gt; &gt; paced Oasis zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out </span></blockquote></div>
