Yes, the other replier is correct. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can<br/>
cast see invis and you should be able to see yourself.<br/>
Also cast see invis on other members of your party<br/>
before you invis the party. It&#39;s a good idea to cast it<br/>
on yourself first so that you know when either is<br/>
fading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Animals can usually not see through invis. Undead always.<br/>
High level NPC&#39;s or NPC&#39;s that cast see invis on<br/>
themselves will see you (sometimes it&#39;s a percent<br/>
chance).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a spell called Invis to Undead though that<br/>
some casters get. Those work against Undead only. I<br/>
don&#39;t know if it stacks with normal invis. Camo<br/>
(druid/ranger version of invis) does not work indoors. Neither<br/>
unfortunately, does SOW. (Lucky bards... lol. I love those ppl.<br/>
They cover my behind-- which is darned<br/>
ugly).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best thing to do is invis yourself and ALWAY con<br/>
something before you get too close if you&#39;ve never been<br/>
invis around it before. You know your invis works if<br/>
they state that they&#39;re indifferent to you. Sometimes,<br/>
I con just to be safe against something dangerous<br/>
b/c I have had times for some reason, that the invis<br/>
worked once but not the second time through an area with<br/>
the same mob (but only while my div was really low.<br/>
It&#39;s in the 55 or so range now and hasn&#39;t been<br/>
inconsistant for a while though).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry to be so long<br/>
winded. Hope this helped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>
