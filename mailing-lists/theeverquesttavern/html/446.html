<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642061775">Ahh...I know what you can do for great<br/>
Experience. First off go hunt in BlackBurrow and kill gnolls<br/>
on the top level. Make sure to collect all the gnoll<br/>
fangs you can find. They are No drop, but bring them<br/>
back to the warrior guild in Qeynos give them to the<br/>
Guard captain guy on the little ledge overlooking the<br/>
arena in there. He will give you great exp for those<br/>
levels, very good faction adjustments, and moonstones for<br/>
every fang you give him. The exp is really great<br/>
though, i was able to gain half a level just with about 6<br/>
gnoll fangs at level 3. So at Level 4 you should still<br/>
get great exp. In the end you can sell the moonstones<br/>
to the merchant for 1.8 silver a piece, which is<br/>
pretty good cash.</div>
