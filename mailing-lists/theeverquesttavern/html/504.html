<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168956917">I was in BB recently with 3 mates - 2 rangers and<br/>
a warrior. We agreed to take on a gnoll commander<br/>
and to make sure no one died, right? So we thump the<br/>
comm enough to where he runs. The others were getting<br/>
pounded, so I taunted him and received much damage.<br/>
Anyway, he ran away, and when he did we ran into 3 gnolls<br/>
who decided to kill me. Everyone else lived but me.<br/>
No one taunted to help, no one healed me. Very lame.<br/>
Those of you out there with healing spells - use them!<br/>
We warriors are strong, but not powerful enough to<br/>
fight death and need the assistance of healing spells<br/>
frequently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Half-Elf warrior of 9 seasons&lt;br&gt;Prexus</div>
