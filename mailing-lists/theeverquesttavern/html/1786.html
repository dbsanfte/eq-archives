<div id="ygrps-yiv-248765227">Totally understand your gripe. Sounds like you<br/>
were in a bad group, with bad spell casters, but I&#39;ve<br/>
not heard their side of the story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s never<br/>
more frustrating for a spell caster than running out<br/>
of mana, telling the party that you are out of mana<br/>
(OOM!), and they still pull. Also, you should have had<br/>
SOW on you...run in circle while your casters MED to<br/>
avoid getting hit. A caster CAN NOT get that MOB off of<br/>
you without a spell...when a caster hits for 12-20<br/>
points of damage, the MOBS in unrest won&#39;t get<br/>
distracted from Aggroing on a tank who&#39;s done 200 pts of<br/>
damage on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, ensure that you are buffed<br/>
before every pull...including SOW. If your casters are<br/>
OOM, don&#39;t pull...in fact, if they are below 50% mana<br/>
(50m), don&#39;t pull!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now why the healer healed the<br/>
80% health wizard...I can only guess he/she was<br/>
either a friend, or had the wrong target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melee<br/>
class and caster class group well together. The rely<br/>
totally on each other. If one side fails, the other<br/>
suffers...it sucks, but it&#39;s reality. Simply don&#39;t group with<br/>
those casters any longer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a druid, I&#39;ve had<br/>
problems with both types in a group, but I can GATE, HEAL,<br/>
and SOW myself out of trouble - even if the group is<br/>
bad! But, as an enchanter, I am totally dependant on<br/>
the group to know their roles and know them well.<br/>
Healers must HEAL before looting, Tanks/Pullers must<br/>
guard while medding, etc. During battle, I mes the<br/>
adds, I debuff the mobs and buff the tank. It&#39;s a<br/>
simple game with incredibly COMPLEX role-playing that<br/>
needs to happen in groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For every story you<br/>
can share about bad casters, I can share about bad<br/>
tanks/pullers. Learn from mistakes, give constructive critisism<br/>
to the group, if they listen, GREAT, you&#39;re group<br/>
will improve. If not, DISBAND, and find some good<br/>
casters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CoJim, Druid of the 24th season.</div>
