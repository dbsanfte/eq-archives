<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909327666">I&#39;ll look up the /con issue for you. When you get<br/>
to higher levels, it makes more of a difference,<br/>
because certain blues and greens (&quot;high greens&quot;) will<br/>
cause you problems, when you might think they&#39;re easy<br/>
kills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The named dwarf is CB (Rondo Dunfire, I<br/>
beleive)is around all the time. HAHA-- i remember the first<br/>
time i saw him- I thought he was a PC helping me take<br/>
on a tough Cent. Then I realized that this little<br/>
fellow was punching me!!! He is now KOS for me whenever<br/>
I&#39;m in CB, and I always leave the tongue and give a<br/>
/shout for people who may be searching for it. (travel<br/>
to CB, you may get lucky and pick it up without<br/>
harm). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for hide/sneak - anyone know this<br/>
answer for sure? I&#39;d like to know, because a (a wood<br/>
elf) have had some probs with getting caught while<br/>
hiding. I have heard that if you /con a mob while hiding,<br/>
that you get a different message (ie. he looks at your<br/>
indifferently instead of threateningly). I need to try this.<br/>
BTW - those orcs and oracles in BB, near the bandit<br/>
camp, are usually a LOT tougher than the ones in CB.<br/>
After I was done raiding CB, I would still occassionly<br/>
camp that evil shrine for good XP. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head to<br/>
Kelethin and visit my people!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;Druid of<br/>
