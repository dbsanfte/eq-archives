<b>Subject:</b> Twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-288383600">I think twinking between two game friends is<br/>
fine, real life is ok. Self from a lvl 50 to a lvl 5 is<br/>
just wrong. I twink a little, I&#39;m lvl 14 twinking a<br/>
lvl 7. &lt;br&gt;I have no problem with twinking except<br/>
that, if the items are WAY TOO high, it ruins the game.<br/>
I t makes the game pointless, so I have a rule that<br/>
I can be no more than ten levels above my char that<br/>
I twink. My Bard btw, is thriving, and doing fine<br/>
with full bronze because I&#39;m good at what I do with my<br/>
druid. But I think that you should not see bards with<br/>
full lambent at lvl 2. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, because I<br/>
mainly play newbies, I have respect to newbies, and<br/>
frequently give gifts from my rich char. He&#39;s rich because I<br/>
delete about three chars a month and each usually makes<br/>
about thirty platinum. So far I have played twenty<br/>
three characters. some on PVP, others on non PVP, still<br/>
others on PVP teams. I don&#39;t mind being a newbie, I hate<br/>
auctioning though, so I give my newbie&#39;s change from stuff<br/>
to true-blue newbies, and twink it instead.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m the kinda person that decides to delete their<br/>
char once twinked at lvl 20. So then I give all my<br/>
armor to someone else. I kept this up for a year. Just<br/>
now decided I should get my act together and make one<br/>
main character. So I deleted and gave away everything<br/>
and started from scratch on a druid. Decided that on<br/>
my way I would twink a bard. But I have earned a lot<br/>
of my stuff the hard way. And I am very generous.<br/>
I&#39;ve given away several thousand platinum worth of<br/>
stuff, and always SOW for free. I bind anyone and<br/>
everyone, and sometimes Plvl people just &#39;cause they seem<br/>
friendly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can never speak for twinkers though,<br/>
because I have subjected myself to rules, and know I&#39;m an<br/>
oddball. I&#39;m also odd in Real Life. When everyone else was<br/>
bullied into giving up their lunch, I spiked mine. When<br/>
everyone else was tired after wrestling practice I ran<br/>
stairs with backpacks on. When everyone else wastes time<br/>
on lockers, I carry everything else with. When<br/>
everyone is annoyed I work twice as hard, and vice versa<br/>
because I don&#39;t care for pushy people. I&#39;m wierd like<br/>
that, but I don&#39;t mind, &#39;cause in about seven years<br/>
since the bully-lunch incident, no body has messed with<br/>
me. Except recently, but I&#39;m brawling wiht them on<br/>
Friday. 8-) &#39;gonna kick his ass.</div>
