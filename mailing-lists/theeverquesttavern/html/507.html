<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375925525">There&#39;s a few dozen class and race combinations,<br/>
faction ratings depending on your class, race and<br/>
religeon that can be improved or worsened, and hundreds of<br/>
different items and spells. It&#39;s a level based game with a<br/>
wide variety of skills, including combat and trade<br/>
skills. You can use some of the skills to create your own<br/>
items for sale or personal use. You can also exchange<br/>
most items with other players. You can either play<br/>
solo, or with up to 5 other players. If you group with<br/>
others you split the experience automatically, and share<br/>
the faction hits and bennies. There&#39;s also an option<br/>
to split loot automatically.&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s a very big,<br/>
highly detailed campaign world with hundreds of npc&#39;s,<br/>
many of which give you quests to go on. And has<br/>
challenges for levels as low as 1 to as high as 50,<br/>
depending on the area you&#39;re in. Also in my opinion it&#39;s<br/>
graphics aren&#39;t anything to sneeze at.&lt;br&gt;I recommend a<br/>
warrior at first, just to get used to the game.</div>
