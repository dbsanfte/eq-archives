<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176240117">Hello all, yes I&#39;ve been around. Checking the<br/>
boards from time to time. EQ so far has been pretty<br/>
good, I&#39;m wining lottos like crazy in the game. (lotto<br/>
is: When an item is found the group randoms the item<br/>
between the people who are in for the item. /ran 1 6) Ive<br/>
pulled off some amazing luck. In one day I aquired a<br/>
Cloak of Shadows (AC12 +12dex +10poison Wt0.0-not more<br/>
than 15 of these on the entire server) and a Short<br/>
Sword of the Ykesha (Damage8 Delay24 Wt4.5 and casts<br/>
&quot;Ykesha&quot; randomly for 75 damage on the monster you are<br/>
fighting) But just letting you all know whats going on in<br/>
Kaylin World over here. See you all in EQ!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin<br/>
