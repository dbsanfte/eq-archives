Rondo Dunfire&#39;s Tongue, however, is one of four needed for a Dwarf <br/>
Rogue-only quest.  Well, you can do it if you&#39;re not a Dwarf Rogue, <br/>
but you won&#39;t be able to use the item you get.  The other tongues are <br/>
from three other Dwarf bandits, all in Butcherblock Mountains.  <br/>
Barma, Crytil and Keldyn are the other three Dwarf Bandits.  Turn in <br/>
their tongues to Diggins in Kaladim (but not Qued&#39;s or anyone <br/>
else&#39;s!), and you get a Parrying Pick (AC 7, Dwarf Rogue only).  It&#39;s <br/>
really useful only until you get Dual Wield at level 13 (?), at which <br/>
point you&#39;ll want two weapons anyway.<br/>
