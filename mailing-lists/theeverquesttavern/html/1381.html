<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546215743">Okay guys, now that we&#39;ve established that<br/>
intelligence isn&#39;t terribly important for a rogue on to<br/>
something new!&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m not sure on a lot of monk abilities,<br/>
and not really sure how to play one but I do have a<br/>
start.&lt;br&gt;I started a human monk named Roen on Xev back in<br/>
the day, and I&#39;ve recently picked him back up. He&#39;s<br/>
about level 6 and I&#39;ve decided to make him an<br/>
exclusively role-playing character (since my druid is pretty<br/>
much just me with magic). He&#39;s agnostic (&#39;cause he<br/>
doesn&#39;t believe in any of that namby-pamby deity<br/>
nonsense, and only in the power of the human body). I do<br/>
not believe in using weapons on a monk, and so he<br/>
does not carry any. He&#39;s been doing fairly well, and<br/>
I&#39;ve been pretty lucky so far. By collecting batwings<br/>
and bone chips, he was able to save up enough for a<br/>
leather tunic, pants and sleeves, and cloth everything<br/>
else. Not too terribly bad. I&#39;ve been working on his<br/>
story for role-play purposes. Here goes with what I<br/>
have thus far:&lt;br&gt; &quot;I was born the son of a wizard and<br/>
a corrupted paladin. My mother believed in some<br/>
deity she called Solusek Ro, while my father (before he<br/>
was turned) was a devout follower of Mithaniel Marr.<br/>
My father was tormented by the death of his brother,<br/>
and finding no solace (sp?) in the Light he turned to<br/>
the embrace of hatred incarnate. Needless to say, he<br/>
turned against his guild, his friends, and his wife. She<br/>
ran for her life to Qeynos, under the protection of<br/>
Antonius Bayle. It was there that she discovered that she<br/>
was bearing me. I was raised in the company of magic<br/>
users of all sorts, but I found myself lacking the<br/>
ability. I also was inept at any form of weaponry. I had<br/>
failed to be like either of my parents. After much<br/>
sadness on my mother&#39;s part, she learned that my now evil<br/>
father was searching for her. She left me in the care of<br/>
the local monks and departed for the plane of air,<br/>
where she remains as far as I know. &lt;br&gt; The monks<br/>
taught me of a peaceful life of meditation, but also<br/>
warned me of the dangers of my father. If he ever<br/>
learned I existed, no doubt he would come after me. I was<br/>
taught in the ways of the monk&#39;s martial arts, and I<br/>
learned them well. Sometimes they would try to explain it<br/>
to me in the way of the &quot;Peaceful one,&quot; but I would<br/>
not listen. If there were greater powers, then my<br/>
family would not be separated and hating each other. I<br/>
can not accept the idea of any greater power, only<br/>
the power of an individual.&lt;br&gt;I advanced quickly in<br/>
my studies and I soon learned that not only could I<br/>
defeat my fellow monk students, but also those training<br/>
in the warrior and mage schools. I then decided that<br/>
no weapon, nor magic, nor unearthly being could<br/>
defeat a perfectly tuned human being. I soon left in<br/>
search of bettering myself, leaving behind the city of<br/>
my birth. I visit cities only when I must for<br/>
provisions, but I prefer to deal with individual merchants in<br/>
the Qeynos Hills or Plains of Karana. I have nothing<br/>
to say to civilization, for it would not<br/>
listen.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that&#39;s about all I have. Any suggestions?</div>
