Now, in Windows, go to Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools, and <br/>
open up System Information.  That will tell you some of the basic <br/>
info we need, like RAM and Windows version.  Won&#39;t tell you your <br/>
processor speed, unfortunately.  If you don&#39;t have System <br/>
Information, you probably have Windows 95 and will need to update to <br/>
Windows 98, XP, or 2000.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, here&#39;s the info from that page on Direct X:<br/>
<br/>
DirectX 8.1 or Higher Required <br/>
<br/>
&quot;With the release of EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, we require <br/>
DirectX 8.1 or higher. This is true not only for those purchasing <br/>
Shadows of Luclin, but for everyone playing EverQuest. All details <br/>
regarding this change can be found here: <br/>

<br/>
To determine what version of DirectX is currently installed on your <br/>
system:<br/>
<br/>
1. Click the Start menu. <br/>
2. Use the Run.. command.. <br/>
3. In the Open field, type &quot;DXDIAG&quot; then click OK. This will launch <br/>
the DirectX diagnostics tool. <br/>
Your version of DirectX will be listed at the bottom of the System <br/>
Information area. For example, version 7.0a is listed as &quot;DirectX 7.0 <br/>
(4.07.00.0716)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Please do the following prior to playing EverQuest. It is very <br/>
important that your drivers are installed in the order indicated to <br/>
avoid potential problems:<br/>
<br/>
4. Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?">https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?</a><br/>
ReleaseID=27741and install the latest DirectX drivers for your <br/>
operating system. <br/>
5. Go to the website for your 3D accelerator. There are a number of <br/>
different manufacturers, and it is preferred that you visit the <br/>
website for the manufacturer of your card. At your option, you can go <br/>
to the chipset manufacturer site. Most will be able to use either <br/>
www.3dfx.com (for Voodoo cards), www.atitech.com (for ATI cards) or <br/>
www.nvidia.com (for TNT/GeForce cards). Download and install the <br/>
latest drivers appropriate for your card and operating system. See <br/>
our Video FAQ <br/>

roubleshooting.jsp) for more details. <br/>
6. Go to the website for your sound card manufacturer and do the <br/>
same. If you do not know what brand of sound card you have, you can <br/>
right-click on &quot;My Computer&quot;, select &quot;properties&quot;, click on &quot;Device <br/>
Manager&quot;, and open the &quot;Sound, Video, and Game Controllers&quot; section. <br/>
Your sound card will be listed there. If you use a SBLive sound card, <br/>
you can run &quot;LiveUpdate&quot; from the Windows Control Panel off of your <br/>
start menu. View our Sound FAQ <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/audio_video/general_audio_t">http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/audio_video/general_audio_t</a><br/>
roubleshooting.jsp) for driver locations and more details. <br/>
If you experience any problems, please do the following:<br/>
<br/>
7. Run DXDIAG.EXE from your Start menu (click start, run, then <br/>
type &quot;dxdiag&quot;) <br/>
8. Click the &quot;Save all Information&quot; button at the bottom of the <br/>
program window. <br/>
9. Save the file as &quot;dxdiag.txt&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Email that file to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqtech@...">eqtech@...</a> along with a complete <br/>
description of your problem, the &quot;dbg.txt&quot; file from your EverQuest <br/>
directory, the text from any error messages that are presented, and <br/>
if you are willing to assist our test department over the phone, a <br/>
phone number where you can be reached.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
