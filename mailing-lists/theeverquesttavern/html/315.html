<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-417468458">Hail all. I really need to get in contact with<br/>
someone who is using cable, namely RoadRunner, or<br/>
ethernet (I am sorry if I spelled it wrong) to connect to<br/>
EQ. Here is my problem...&lt;br&gt;Sometime Monday<br/>
afternoon, 9-27, we started having probelms logging into EQ,<br/>
we could log into the patch-server but when you type<br/>
your password in a message would come up &quot;could not<br/>
connect with... Try again later&quot; like EQ was down. Well<br/>
at this point I figured it could be down, after all<br/>
they were having some problems last week. However, on<br/>
Tuesday afternoon, after the patch was reported complete,<br/>
we tried logging in and we did log into the<br/>
patch-server and d/led the patch but when we got to the<br/>
password screen we got the same annoying &quot;try again later&quot;<br/>
message. At this point I figured something was wrong so I<br/>
called EQ&#39;s tech support line... I was on the phone with<br/>
them for at least an hour that night, and I must say<br/>
they were very helpful. We ran tests and tried<br/>
everything he could think of... he even logged onto my<br/>
account and had no problems. So we decided it must be my<br/>
ISP. I called RoadRunner and told them what the EQ guy<br/>
told me, and he said &quot;if you can connect to the<br/>
internet its not our problem&quot;, which I have a problem with<br/>
because they are my ISP I am paying them to connect me to<br/>
things, any things, that have anything to do with the<br/>
internet or being online. So after I was told to go away I<br/>
called EQ back, he tried a few more things but we still<br/>
couldn&#39;t come up with anything... by this time we are<br/>
REALLY having EQ-withdraw... I wrote to you all about<br/>
this yesterday, hee hee. To try to prove, mostly to<br/>
ourselves that it was RoadRunner or some connection through<br/>
RoadRunner, we installed AOL onto our computer and we were<br/>
able to connect to our account on EQ with NO problems,<br/>
but unfortunatly we don&#39;t have an AOL account and<br/>
don&#39;t want to pay for 2 ISPs. Anyway, we spent most of<br/>
yesterday, Wed, on the phone bouncing from EQ to RoadRunner<br/>
and even to Gateway (they made our computer) because<br/>
RoadRunner told us they may have something to do with it,<br/>
they didn&#39;t have a clue what we were talking about,<br/>
and still nothing! Noone has any clue what is going<br/>
on, we are &quot;the only ones having this problem&quot;.<br/>
AAARRRGGGGG!&lt;br&gt;I went to the EQ website yesterday and looked at<br/>
the message boards under Tech Help, and... whats<br/>
this... other people are having problems connecting after<br/>
the last patch? Well at least now we know its not<br/>
just us... and everyone having the problem seems to be<br/>
connecting via cable or ethernet, we have cable. We called<br/>
EQ back and they say they have started getting more<br/>
complaints similar to ours and alot of people in our area,<br/>
FL, connecting through RoadRunner are having the same<br/>
problem too and RoadRunner won&#39;t respond to EQ&#39;s calls<br/>
about these people&#39;s connection. We called RoadRunner,<br/>
again, they say they &quot;have no idea what we are talking<br/>
about&quot; and now someone is going to call us in the next<br/>
couple of days to let us know what they find out.<br/>
Needless to say I am very aggrevated with RoadRunner for<br/>
completely ignoring us but very pleased with EQ tech help<br/>
for at least trying to help. Anyway, what I need is<br/>
to talk to someone using cable, RoadRunner, or<br/>
ethernet so I can see if anyone else is having this<br/>
problem... or people with phone connection, if you are<br/>
having problems too. I need to know when it started<br/>
happening, your aprox location(like FL, USA) and who your<br/>
ISP is. Please repond or e-mail me if you have had<br/>
any similar problems, even if they have been fixed.<br/>
We are taking this into our own hands since we can&#39;t<br/>
get help. Any information would be<br/>
useful.&lt;br&gt;P.S.&lt;br&gt;If you have a question, since I rambled my way<br/>
through this post, please ask I will respond back, after<br/>
all I have nothing else to do with no EQ,<br/>
lol.&lt;br&gt;Thanks alot,&lt;br&gt;Khalista&lt;br&gt;Cleric of Tunare</div>
