<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195647066">Hi all, I just joined the club while taking a<br/>
(brief) break from playing EQ. I got 65 characters in all<br/>
over 9 servers (one on the test server).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll<br/>
try to introduce them over time... ;-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Playing<br/>
with so many characters has some major drawbacks<br/>
though... My highest character is still only lvl8 and you<br/>
never get to group with the same people more then<br/>
once..</div>
