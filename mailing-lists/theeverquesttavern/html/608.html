<b>Subject:</b> 19th in Cazic Thule <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-470269686">I just got level 19 last night in Cazic Thule<br/>
myself. I&#39;d say 19 is generally too low to be there, but<br/>
the circumstances allowed it. There were 2 high level<br/>
groups in the front area pulling things. They didn&#39;t<br/>
mind if we helped is disposing of the &quot;trash&quot; as they<br/>
called it, Warders, Defenders, and those low level<br/>
casters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was in a full group. Myself (Enchanter 18),<br/>
Shadow Knight 18, Ranger 20, Shaman 20, and 2 Wizards<br/>
both 20. A few of the things we were pulling were red<br/>
to me. So instead of watching my spells get<br/>
resisted, I would help in other ways. I&#39;d of course Tashan<br/>
the Mob (unresistable). Then I&#39;d usually Quickness<br/>
the tanks and Mez any extras. Shaman was on Heal<br/>
duty, as his DOTs weren&#39;t really necessary with 2<br/>
wizards in the group :) Memory Blur came in handy for me<br/>
many times also. One of the Wizards wasn&#39;t too good at<br/>
timing his burn and got frenzied on a lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We had<br/>
to zone a couple of times, but with SoW it wasn&#39;t<br/>
bad. I ended up getting 19th level there. Then the<br/>
high level groups started thinning out and the<br/>
remainders were pulling stuff they couldn&#39;t quite handle,<br/>
which was exceedingly dangerous for us. So we decided<br/>
to split.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, a very good night. But in<br/>
general, I&#39;d say Cazic Thule is not intended for people<br/>
below level 20 :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good hunting to you<br/>
all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>
