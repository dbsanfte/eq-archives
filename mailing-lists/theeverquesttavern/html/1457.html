<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468296040">I think two level 19&#39;s could make it.. .cause<br/>
you&#39;re druid... so therefore if you go .. you take<br/>
Butcherblock to Firona Vie and then keep killing at Lake of<br/>
Ill Omens...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s plenty to kill it&#39;s just<br/>
it will be dangerous to run all the way to LoiO. And<br/>
you will be a mite underpowered. I&#39;ve seen ppl around<br/>
level 19 yelling for groups all the time there<br/>
though... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as the SK suggestion... that&#39;s<br/>
what I did... I killed a bit in Highpass and SK at<br/>
aviak city for a good long while before I headed to<br/>
Kunark. That&#39;s actually a pretty good time all the way<br/>
from 18 to 23. At which time, I grabbed my ring spells<br/>
and headed to Kunark. I have my bind point in FV.<br/>
