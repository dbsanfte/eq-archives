<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-397144633">Ive been hunting in BB for since I hit LVL 8. The<br/>
other day someone shouted: PWRLVLED 3LVLs n 20 minutes!<br/>
I hailed him & asked him to give up the secret~No<br/>
secret, just something Ive never done for XPz&lt;br&gt;<br/>
BONECHIPS~I normally sale to NECS for desent PP but, turned<br/>
in a stack to Gunlok Jure in the paladin&#39;s guild in<br/>
Kalidem (4 at a time) & went from 8-9 with a stack! Damn<br/>
good xpz! Supposely u can do this all the way up to<br/>
60??? If you got the time try it! It is possible that<br/>
players with low faction will not get anything by giving<br/>
him bone chips.&lt;br&gt; Another really good XP boost is<br/>
the Orc Runners BP/Sealed letters-go tto the Pally<br/>
guild in Felwithe (downstairs_ generl somebody?)</div>
