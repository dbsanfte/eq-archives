<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358044298">I heartedly agree with you concerning knowing the<br/>
game. Many of my friends who started out about the same<br/>
time as me have gone way up in level (high 30&#39;s and<br/>
40&#39;s) while I just hit 27. They may be real good at<br/>
grouping and killing and getting tons of money and<br/>
experience, they know very little about the quests, npcs and<br/>
lay of the land. I , on the other hand, have found<br/>
many quests they did not know about (faydark ringmail<br/>
for instance) and can navigate through many of the<br/>
zones almost blindfolded. &lt;br&gt; I had to laugh when one<br/>
of them (name removed to protect her 35th cleric&#39;s<br/>
pride) did not know how to get to Kaladim from the druid<br/>
ring and then needed to be shown where the bank was.<br/>
&lt;br&gt; As for wisdom, don&#39;t let it worry you. Your game<br/>
play can always be adapted to match your mana pool. As<br/>
for myself, I am a halfling druid who started with<br/>
115 wisdom. Now, after many purchases, exchanges and<br/>
quests I have a wisdom of 168. If you want an extra<br/>
wisdom point, just go buy some paladin pickles from<br/>
Boomba the Big in Freeport. It&#39;s amazing what some<br/>
people will trade for stat enhancing food and even<br/>
alcohol. ;)&lt;br&gt; As for me, fish scales are always needed.<br/>
I am bravely exploring all the underwater regions<br/>
of Norrath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye Cousteau&lt;br&gt;The Wolf of<br/>
