<div id="ygrps-yiv-789662488">Well, 15, almost 16 WE Ranger here, so let me tell you where I&#39;ve <br/>
been. <br/>
<br/>
1-9, or so - Greater Faydark/Crushbone, doing the orcs and Ranger <br/>
Newbie armor quests.  Why&#39;d you relocate to Qeynos, anyway?  Our <br/>
(Wood Elf) armor and weapon quests are all centered in GFay.  But now <br/>
that you&#39;re 12, they may not be worth doing.  <br/>
9-11 - Ocean of Tears, kiling Alluring Sirens.  Jump off the boat at <br/>
either set of islands between Butcherblock and Freeport. You&#39;ll see <br/>
the Sirens.  Watch out for the Goblins, too.<br/>
12-13 - Steamfont, collecting micro servers for the Trueshot quest <br/>
later on<br/>
14-current - Nybright sisters in Lesser Faydark.  <br/>
<br/>
After this I&#39;m headed to the Warrens, but am going to wait for Dual <br/>
Wield at 17.  Hate to get out there, then have to go someplace else <br/>
to train.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a very good weapon, which makes some of this a bit easier.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.</div>
