<div id="ygrps-yiv-493463761">Well, I give you my thanks for the info. I shall<br/>
have to try this server. I think an enchanteris a good<br/>
char, but what is a good race for that type? I played<br/>
on E&#39;ci because that is the server my friends (in<br/>
RL) were on. E&#39;ci was ok except for the major<br/>
overcrowding. And the fact that I managed to always be in a<br/>
group with a whacked char or two. I did try another<br/>
server for about a month but that was right about the<br/>
time I started school. I live with the grandparents<br/>
and they were always harping about how much time I<br/>
spent on the comp, so I had to quit playing. Now if<br/>
Uncle Sam will just send me my check, (*peers up to<br/>
Heaven in praying posture*) I can use that for a deposit<br/>
and live on campus. (Gotta LOVE a school with<br/>
apartment complexes on campus!) Hopefully if all goes well<br/>
I will be back in the game within a month to a<br/>
month and a half. (*rolls dice and closes eyes before<br/>
they land*)Thanks. The Raven</div>
