<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551321579">Hey everyone!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just started playing EQ<br/>
again, and I thought I would seek out a club on Yahoo!<br/>
for the hell of it. I play on two servers<br/>
currently:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lanys Ty&#39;vyl&lt;br&gt;&quot;Hyuri&quot;&lt;br&gt;Lvl 7 Troll<br/>
Shadowknight&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rallos Zek&lt;br&gt;&quot;Kraimar&quot;&lt;br&gt;Lvl 5 Halfling<br/>
Cleric&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I started my halfling three days ago, and I am<br/>
putting most of my time into him. I just hit lvl 5<br/>
today.. lots of new spells ;) Anyway, I am looking for<br/>
groups to adventure with on either server Saturday and<br/>
Sunday nights, around 8PM-12PM EST. If interested, check<br/>
my profile for email address. My Cleric on Rallos is<br/>
pretty good for his level... I am hitting for 20 points<br/>
at a time, which is pretty damn good for a shrimp at<br/>
5th lvl :) I also have decent equipment, and all my<br/>
lvl one spells, and most of my lvl<br/>
five.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, I want to know everyone&#39;s thoughts on PK. I like<br/>
playing on Rallos because it adds an edge of danger to<br/>
the game. Yet when I get tired of watching my back<br/>
all the time I head to Lanys. Ironically enough, my<br/>
Troll on Lanys has died seven or eight times... while<br/>
my Halfling has yet to die even once, and on a pk<br/>
server to boot. Do you all like the current pk rules?<br/>
When I first started, players could be looted for<br/>
money and ANY item. Now it&#39;s limited to carried items,<br/>
worn items, and money. I&#39;m not complaining too much,<br/>
but it seems to neuter pk&#39;ing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope to see<br/>
some of you on EQ soon,&lt;br&gt;Sandwalker</div>
