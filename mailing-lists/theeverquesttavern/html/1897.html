<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-524695048">The Drinal Guild many have waited for. We are the<br/>
League of Misfits, &quot;new souls&quot; of Drinal, breathing new<br/>
life into that &quot;misfit&quot; of Norrath. A guild that<br/>
understands that some of us have family & jobs and need<br/>
overall &quot;ying and yang&quot; for the game and real life in<br/>
general. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becoming a citizen of Norrath can be a<br/>
difficult task. There are many guilds that will insist you<br/>
pull up a chair, grab that 6-pack of Jolt cola and<br/>
toss 8 hrs away for the good of the Raid. The League<br/>
is not that guild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The League is a guild that<br/>
understands and game is still a game, period. The League is a<br/>
guild for that &quot;special&quot; player that just wants to<br/>
play, kill stuff and gain exp....after you figure out<br/>
what that spell is..... Sure, we may plan a raid? But<br/>
it will be a sight uphold!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An exclusive guild<br/>
on Drinal that gives you a &quot;second chance&quot; to prove<br/>
your worth in the world of Norrath. We have a 100%<br/>
tolerance policy, you screw up...you try again. Its just a<br/>
game and we all understand that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Help us help<br/>
you. The League of Misfits exists for you. Give us a<br/>
tell in game, you know who you are.....experience not<br/>
required.</div>
