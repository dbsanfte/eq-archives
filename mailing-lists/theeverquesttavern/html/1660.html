<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355178026">In addition to Stormfang&#39;s comments, some<br/>
classes/races are easier to roleplay for lack of a better word.<br/>
One of the best clerics I have ever met was indeed a<br/>
roleplayer, or at least she seemed so to me. Druid<br/>
roleplayers, on the other hand, are incredibly few and far<br/>
between. With all my characters I try desperately to<br/>
roleplay to my best, but some are just easier/more fun to<br/>
roleplay. For instance, I have a monk who I roleplay as a<br/>
mute. He doesn&#39;t speak, except to his guild superiors<br/>
(for training and quest purposes) to everyone else he<br/>
either shows his intentions through emotions (emotes) or<br/>
/e scribbles on a scrap of parchment &quot;(whatever<br/>
needs to be said)&quot; and passes it to (whoever he is<br/>
conversing with). It takes a little bit longer to have a<br/>
conversation, but it&#39;s different. In groups however, he is in<br/>
tune to the immediate mental powers of those around<br/>
him (hence groupspeak) and he tends to speak in very<br/>
eloquent thoughts. So... you&#39;ll never see a /shout from<br/>
Roen. /OOC with train! perhaps, or even an /auc ooc:<br/>
WTB such-and-such.&lt;br&gt;I like roleplaying my troll<br/>
warrior, simply because instead of just taunting like so<br/>
many warriors do, he insults the target. Something to<br/>
the effect of &quot;Hey %T! You mudder is a hairy<br/>
halfing!&quot; Hehehe... Halflings are his favorite snack, and<br/>
he&#39;ll tell you so. Hehe.&lt;br&gt;Anyways, there&#39;s no real<br/>
point in any of that, but in a world filled with shouts<br/>
of &quot;Dr00d Newbie wants Phat Lewts!&quot; or other such<br/>
garbage, it is difficult to maintain IC all the time.<br/>
Having a guild of RPers does help, and I&#39;ve been meaning<br/>
to get Roen into one. Hehe... Roen the<br/>
mental-intuned, mute monk. Agnostic monk at that. None of that<br/>
silly god stuff, or magic, or weapons to worry about.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;On Xev there is a RP guild named &quot;Covenant of Lore&quot;<br/>
I believe it is.... I know I&#39;ve heard of one on<br/>
Mithaniel Marr server, but I&#39;ve yet to run into a guild of<br/>
RPers on Karana. About time someone started<br/>
one!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;&quot;My mother was an elf, dad.. well..<br/>
he was a hippie, my sister&#39;s a tree and my brother&#39;s<br/>
a wolf. I&#39;m always out of mana, I eat stuff off the<br/>
ground and I&#39;ve foraged grubs for the past hour and a<br/>
half.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roen&lt;br&gt;:glares coldly at a gnoll commander&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gamek<br/>
Frogsmasher&lt;br&gt;&quot;Hey Cain Darkmoore! You mudder is a hairy halfing!&quot;</div>
