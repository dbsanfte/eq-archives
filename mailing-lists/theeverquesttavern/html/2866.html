&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my experience, anyone who would be so afflicted by<br/>
&gt; the outcome of a game is not a terribly stable person<br/>
&gt; in the first place.  Everquest has actually helped me<br/>
&gt; save money for tuition, and has kept me out of trouble<br/>
&gt; as well.  I sit at home and play EverQuest for a few<br/>
&gt; hours every night.  With a starting cost of 9.95 for<br/>
&gt; the game, 12.95 a month for a pre-paid card (I hate<br/>
&gt; credit cards), I get the first month free, 19.99 a<br/>
&gt; month in internet services (which I would have anyway)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everquest is a subliminal addiction, just like certain people setting <br/>
all things aside for football... on a much lesser scale of course <br/>
because quite frank, there is absolutely no redeeming value of <br/>
dedicating one&#39;s entire time and achieving something in a video game <br/>
besides personal satisfaction (unless it&#39;s some godawful tournament <br/>
which I can&#39;t ****ing stand). It all depends on the individual. <br/>
Certain people can set rigid guidelines for themselves (play for a <br/>
certain number of hours) and abide by them, and some people can&#39;t. <br/>
