<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572361595">considering we all work or shool or something maybe a sunday afternoon or evening.. or saturday, but if you have a free evening or something. Everyone write down a day they can do this and we will pick the best for all of us.<br/>

would be kind of hard I suppose.<br/>

&gt;HMMMMMMMMMM................ maybe we can all make a new char and pick one <br/>
&gt;particular server for everone to meet at and group with. I think that would <br/>
&gt;be really neat. We could meet one day a week on these characters, that way <br/>
&gt;we can play our others too. I know some of you already have 5 characters. <br/>
&gt;But you can delete to make a new character. I have done that to move to <br/>
&gt;different server. Now i only have 2 charcaters, so ie easy for me to go to <br/>
&gt;different server to make a new character. I thought this would be a neat <br/>
&gt;idea, kinda like a club thing.... Well, let me know you guys what you think <br/>
&gt;and we can decide if we would like to try this.      Surreal<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmmi would say first to go to www.eqdruids.com if you dont already<br/>
&gt;know about it. It is a terrific druid only site. In the messages<br/>
&gt;boards they have sticky post about where to hunt at your general lvl.<br/>
&gt;Not for sure but at 41 i think i was quadding snow cougers in ice<br/>
&gt;clad or maybe the specs in oasis. After them i went to timoruos deep<br/>
&gt;and started quadding spirocs. That took me to all the way to 51 xp<br/>
&gt;slows down at about 50 51 on the spirocs but i know can take you to<br/>
&gt;52 as i am about to ding it there. Or you can start trying the<br/>
&gt;raptors in that same zone also. I havent tried them yet but read that<br/>
&gt;it can be done. If you want to make some money and xp head to cobalt<br/>
&gt;scar and quad the wyverns. Save the pelts and sell them in bazaar and<br/>
&gt;sell the gems to vendors for about 40plat. This is a bit more<br/>
&gt;dangerous and harder as there is always people there farming. Unless<br/>
&gt;you have killed alot of giants in velious and raised your claws of<br/>
&gt;veeshan<br/>
&gt;faction you will be kos to the drakes there and they cast on you for<br/>
&gt;like 300 dam. Do not pull the named wyvern he cannot be slowed or<br/>
&gt;snared. As far as the wis items i just went to bazaar and filled in<br/>
&gt;the filters one of them you can pick wis and all wis items will come<br/>
&gt;up then just shop away. It will be slow quadding till you get your<br/>
&gt;new aoe spell lightnig blast and lvl 45 when you can get kei then its<br/>
&gt;smooth sailing to 51. Oh there is a good quest wis book you can hold<br/>
&gt;in your off hand adss like 10 wis and somethin other would be easy to<br/>
&gt;obtain at you lvl. Sorry but i forgot the name of it next time im on<br/>
&gt;ill check but can prolly find it on the druid site.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I guess I&#39;m the loner. I&#39;m on Drinal & Luclin.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My main is a 41 druid named Charai accompanied by a warrior named<br/>
&gt;Athynna, bard named Jovvi, monk named Whyyte Lhyyte(hehehe), pally<br/>
&gt;named Minniey & a chanter named Tymthyn Jhntr (sound it out - think<br/>
&gt;Monte Python).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone got suggestions for zones for the druid. Currently camping<br/>
&gt;ruins in Dreadlands, but it is getting slow going xp wise (though<br/>
&gt;cash loot is rather profitable)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, need some ideas for wisdom gear. Charai was 1st character & I<br/>
&gt;made some serious errors setting her up. So looking for some nice<br/>
&gt;mana & wisdom gear. Especially since I am starting on my epic soon  ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Laters<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sue<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just me<br/>
&gt; &gt; No cute, sappy quotes<br/>
&gt; &gt; No wise words of wisdom<br/>
