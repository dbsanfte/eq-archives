<b>Subject:</b> Beginner notes on Rallos Zek <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-97237328">I played a Cleric on Rallos Zek up to 12th level.<br/>
I do not know everything there is to know about<br/>
PvP, but I can offer some advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get the spell<br/>
Flash of Light and have it memorized at all times in<br/>
potential PK areas. Put it on a Hot Key. If someone flashes<br/>
you, you can still hit the Hot Key and flash them<br/>
back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Always try to keep your target box empty. Hit the ESC<br/>
key often as a habit. This will allow you to<br/>
auto-target anybody trying to blast you with a spell. Then<br/>
you can Flash them without having to spin around (or<br/>
look up) to find them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep Divine Aura<br/>
memorized. You should probably be doing this even on the<br/>
regular servers. It will give you a valuable 10 seconds<br/>
of immunity to zone, bag your stuff, or<br/>
whatever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take your valuables off during long medding sessions.<br/>
The items that act as &quot;Kill Me Please&quot; signs are<br/>
Chest, Legs, Arms and Head. Boots and Gloves are fairly<br/>
generic and do not attract a lot of attention. You could<br/>
wear the best belt, earings, rings, mask, gorget, and<br/>
cloak in the game...and nobody would know since they<br/>
usually do not show up on your character model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If<br/>
someone inspects you, target them, back up, get rdy to<br/>
fight, run, or die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bank often. Losing items to a<br/>
PK is the worst part, but no sense losing a lot of<br/>
money as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep your health above what you<br/>
usually would on a normal server while medding. For<br/>
example, if you have 3 bubble of health and only one<br/>
bubble of mana you&#39;d usually just sit down to med. On a<br/>
PvP server, I&#39;d spend that last bubble of mana to<br/>
raise my health to 4 bubbles if possible. Nobody has to<br/>
know you&#39;re OOM. But they can clearly see your health<br/>
status.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talk to people. They will often tell you if there is a<br/>
naked mage (the plague of PvP) in the area. Steer clear<br/>
of that area. If you&#39;ve been told so-and-so is a PK<br/>
and then you see him and he says it was a lie, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t believe him. Better to be paranoid than<br/>
dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you see your friend getting rocked by someone and<br/>
cannot help them (he and the PK are both way above or<br/>
below you in level) try to loot your friend&#39;s corpse<br/>
the INSTANT he dies. You can then give your friend<br/>
whatever item you took back, and prevent the PK from<br/>
getting anything. I&#39;m not sure if this works anymore on<br/>
Rallos, but it did when I played there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spell<br/>
Stun is very nice. If you can time it correctly, you<br/>
can begin casting it the same time as a wizard starts<br/>
his casting. Stun will usually cast faster, and break<br/>
their concentration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are some things I<br/>
learned during my time on Rallos. I hope the<br/>
help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell (because I got tired of being paranoid<br/>
:)</div>
