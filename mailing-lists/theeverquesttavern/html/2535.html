<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746437953">I really wouldn&#39;t worry to much about stats,<br/>
location of starting point. Sure you may get a pretty lost<br/>
at first, but you will find your way around<br/>
eventually and it is always a good idea to have as maybe<br/>
places known to you. As for stats theres lots of stat<br/>
buffing stuff out there, as well as lots of buffing<br/>
spells. Faction however is something I would take in<br/>
consideration, depending however if you like being the &quot;outlaw<br/>
type&quot; hehe. I think the most important thing you should<br/>
look for is unique chararistics in a player. A warrior<br/>
who can safe fall(Vah Shir), or warrior who can<br/>
hide/forage for food(wood elf), which could come in handy I&#39;m<br/>
sure, ah HG!!! /hide... =) A shammy, necro who has the<br/>
ability to regen as well as xtra Ac(Iksar) Unfortunatly I<br/>
don&#39;t speak from experiance, these are just ideas of<br/>
mine. I myself started with the typical Barb shammy<br/>
good character I think, but I wish I would have chosen<br/>
something a little &quot;different&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just my opionon....<br/>
