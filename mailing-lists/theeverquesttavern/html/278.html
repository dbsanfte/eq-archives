<b>Subject:</b> My first piece of Rubicite armor... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881789518">Well, I&#39;m lvl 34 now, and i FINALLY have some<br/>
rubi...I won a helm last nite in Cazic =) It&#39;s wt3.5 and<br/>
AC12. Quite nice, although it does look crappy on me<br/>
(IMO). Fashionwise, Gilerrin is a wreck: he wears a<br/>
shiny red helm, has a grey and green tunic, pants, and<br/>
leggings, and black boot. Oh, and he also has shiny metal<br/>
bracers.&lt;br&gt;Oh well i&#39;m sure you&#39;re all sick of my blabbering..</div>
