<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749073733">OK - in the first place, why do they only release<br/>
shots of Gnomes? The ugliest critters on the face of<br/>
Norrath, and that&#39;s all they can show?! (j/k for all you<br/>
Gnomes out there -- they are cousins of my favorite<br/>
race, Dwarves, after all).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go here to see new<br/>
Luclin screenshots, about 40 of<br/>
&#39;em:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/filters/products/screenindex/0,11104,477597,00.html">http://gamespot.com/gamespot/filters/products/screenindex/0,11104,477597,00.html</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/filters/products/screenindex/0,11104,477597,00.html&lt;/a">http://gamespot.com/gamespot/filters/products/screenindex/0,11104,477597,00.html&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I decided that what it is about the new character<br/>
models is not that they look cartoonish, but that they<br/>
look like claymation. I looked at one and thought --<br/>
&quot;Hey, that guy was in Chicken Run!&quot; This could be a<br/>
calculated move on their part -- if you&#39;re ever going to do<br/>
a movie, why not have the characters look like they<br/>
do in the game?! Just a (conspiratorial) thought. I<br/>
am a Rogue, you know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
