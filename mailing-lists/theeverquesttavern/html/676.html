<div id="ygrps-yiv-557257481">If you want to dabble in spellcasting a Paladin<br/>
would help ease you into it. They&#39;re less complicated<br/>
magic wise than pure spellcasters, and they have the<br/>
muscle to keep you alive while you&#39;re dabbling with your<br/>
spells.&lt;br&gt;Paladins are mostly warriors until you reach level 9, so<br/>
you could get familiar with combat before you start<br/>
dabbling in magic too.</div>
