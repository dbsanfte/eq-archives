<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990642208">Thanks for the tips, there were a few I didn&#39;t<br/>
know. And I do have Flash of Light and Divine Aura<br/>
memorized, both great spells. I just got gate but it uses up<br/>
three quarters of my mana. I have pk&#39;ed there, but only<br/>
in self defense and the Flash of Light spell helps<br/>
quite a bit, except for the short duration. Now that<br/>
root isn&#39;t as effective in pvp Clerics have been<br/>
slightly weakened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, most of my best items are<br/>
in the bank. I have a Bronze Breastplate but I dare<br/>
not wear it at my level. I&#39;m waiting for more HP&#39;s<br/>
and better spells. I figured I could gate out of<br/>
trouble, but the casting time at my level is way too high.<br/>
Could I theoretically use Divine Aura for<br/>
Invulnerability, then Gate to escape? Can I still be hit while<br/>
invulnerable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the help!&lt;br&gt;Sandwalker</div>
