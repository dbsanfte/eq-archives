<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082045351">IMHO, you shouldn&#39;t lay down the plat to buy an<br/>
Executioner&#39;s Axe. The last time I saw them, they cost around<br/>
1kpp (probably dropped a bit since then).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For<br/>
less than that, you could get a Runic Carver - 18/37,<br/>
2hs. Almost the exact same damage to delay ratio, plus<br/>
you will get more swings in. More swings = more aggro<br/>
= good warrior. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or, if a sword is not to<br/>
your liking, you could pick up a Mithril Staff -<br/>
28/45, 2hb. Again, better than the Mithril Staff in<br/>
every way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The haste proc on the Executioner&#39;s<br/>
Axe seems to be more annoying than anything. Not only<br/>
is the proc infrequent, it does overwrite enchanter<br/>
haste and lasts only 10 seconds. It&#39;s not really enough<br/>
to make a difference you&#39;ll notice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could<br/>
either the Carver or the Staff for under 1kpp, if not<br/>
substantially less. I&#39;ve seen Carvers for sale around 500pp, so<br/>
that might be something to shoot<br/>
for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51 champion of Prexus</div>
