<div id="ygrps-yiv-999895566">I was just thinking of starting up EQ aagin so I<br/>
thought I would just lurk and read. But this caught my<br/>
eye. I have been playing UO since February on AOL and<br/>
had to set up a separate ISP just to play it (I<br/>
prefer the AOL email and quiting that was out of the<br/>
question).AOL 5.0 knocked me off line;at least it was a clean<br/>
knock off.AOL 6.0 locked up!But the other night I<br/>
downloaded the new AOL 7.0.I am using it with windows 98SE<br/>
with no problems. I am now cancelling the second<br/>
ISP.AOL 7.0 is working great for me.</div>
