<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348634976">Ok, first thing I want to say is that I have not<br/>
played a monk so I am certainly not an expert, but I<br/>
still think that I can help with some of your questions<br/>
because I have grouped with monks and have some friends<br/>
who play them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -Hand to hand vs. using<br/>
weapons? Monks are hand to hand fighters - perhaps you may<br/>
develope a weapon skill for the fun of it but you will be<br/>
more affective going hand to hand. You can get a pair<br/>
of magical gloves such as Netted gloves and you will<br/>
be able to hit creatures that can only be hit by<br/>
magic (like wisps). Netted gloves are pretty easy to<br/>
get-go to everlore.com to get info on them. Anytime I<br/>
have ever grouped with monks they have never used<br/>
weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Is Round Kick better than Tiger Claw? I cant<br/>
really help you there, sorry. I would say to develope<br/>
them both-keep both skills maxed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; How much<br/>
weight? I believe the amount of weight you can carry<br/>
without penalty is 14 pounds (one reason you probably<br/>
dont want to use a weapon). Monks have natural AC that<br/>
will suffer if you are carrying too much weight. I<br/>
dont know if it affects your attacks or not. Remember<br/>
that coins have weight and will encumber you if you<br/>
are carrying alot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Well, I hope this helps -<br/>
Happy hunting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Venture T`Asp&lt;br&gt; 20 Necro &lt;br&gt;<br/>
