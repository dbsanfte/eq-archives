<b>Subject:</b> Re: Will trade powerleveling on Karana <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-507567643">I myself do not do the power-leveling thing. It&#39;s<br/>
my friend that does it for money. As far as I know<br/>
he only does it on the Brell server because that&#39;s<br/>
where his level 50 Druid is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He gets the account<br/>
info. He gives the login to another friend of his. That<br/>
guy logs on as the level 1 guy. My original friend<br/>
logs on as his level 50 Druid and procedes to<br/>
power-level the new account. When finished, he gets<br/>
paid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>
