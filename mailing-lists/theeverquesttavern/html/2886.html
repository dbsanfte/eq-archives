&gt; Well it took me a little bit, but I have started a mage char for <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; guild. She just got started so she&#39;s still lvl 1. (lol I haven&#39;t <br/>
even <br/>
&gt; killed anything yet.) I have never played a mage before. How much <br/>
&gt; harder is it to play then an enchanter?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also I&#39;m sorry for not posting lately. I&#39;ve had some major tests in <br/>
&gt; Bio and Psych. I&#39;ve also managed to break my hand again so it&#39;s in <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; cast. The bad part is the cast goes past my elbow so it&#39;s kinda <br/>
hard <br/>
&gt; to use a mouse right now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll be able to play more during the Quarter Break. I&#39;ll also be <br/>
able <br/>
&gt; to play a bit more next quarter since my schedule won&#39;t be so <br/>
&gt; horrible and the classes will be easier.<br/>
