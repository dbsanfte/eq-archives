<div id="ygrps-yiv-298347427">Greetings,<br/>
I am a lvl 12, almost 13 Ranger/woodelf who is in need of guidance to <br/>
where i can up my lvls.  I have been residing in North Quynos and am <br/>
getting bored with the scenery.  I have a good weapon but it isn&#39;t <br/>
hitting for as many points as i would like, typical story huh?<br/>
I am confusted about the quests, how do you learn about them?<br/>
I went through one for a sword, but when i finished and got my prize <br/>
it was only for human rangers and high elf rangers, i was <br/>
devistated!!!  All that work and no show for it.<br/>
Anways, any help/hints/ideas would be greatly appriciated!!!<br/>
