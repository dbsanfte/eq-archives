<div id="ygrps-yiv-920198573">Yeah ok i see where you&#39;re coming from but bottom<br/>
lin is if you aren&#39;t happy with your class play a<br/>
class you do like... play a mage if you think there<br/>
better (no I&#39;m not meaning you personal, more to ALL the<br/>
people who say &quot;my class sucks&quot;) My favorit class is the<br/>
SK and I wanted to play an SK before I got the game<br/>
because that is the class closest to what I played in<br/>
other rpgs (spellsword in Daggerfall). I find enjoyment<br/>
in my class although I don&#39;t really like to be only<br/>
pure evil and liked to have some more and better dd<br/>
spells. But that is just what I ment everybody is always<br/>
whining. If you don&#39;t like it stop doing it. Guess it is<br/>
just how I view it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once again My wiz is very<br/>
low in level and I don&#39;t really like my wiz that<br/>
much. So.... I prob won&#39;t play him past level 10.<br/>
instead I play my mage and enchanter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Same thing<br/>
kind of aplies to my warriors boring at times. But<br/>
also makes it simple to play concentrating on one<br/>
thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See you in<br/>
Norath.&lt;br&gt;Alrix,&lt;br&gt;Catai,&lt;br&gt;Garrus,&lt;br&gt;Sarumann,&lt;br&gt;Tharkas,&lt;br&gt;Wieckser,&lt;br&gt;Yargon,&lt;br&gt;Yondar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;on Berto</div>
