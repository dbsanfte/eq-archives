<div id="ygrps-yiv-107255304">hi   <br/>
  ive been on this list for months now,  <br/>
  but have only commented a few times and dont think i ever introduced my self.  my apologies   <br/>
<br/>
  ive been playing eq sense last february and have a lvl 54 druid on the xev server.  <br/>
<br/>
  im currently a member of the Ancient Fellowship guild and have a lvl 40 shadow knight, a level 13 chanter, a lvl 13 beast lord, lvl 8 rogue, and a lvl 7 shaman who is now my bazaar mule.  <br/>
<br/>
  i have never played on another server but have wondered about them.  <br/>
  part of the reason i stayed on xev is because i dont know anyone on other servers.  <br/>
<br/>
  i know there is at lease one server that strongly encourages roll play but have never tried it, and iver heard rumors of servers that are adult only.    <br/>
<br/>
  i was wondering if anyone wanted to coment on what they knew about the different servers.    <br/>
<br/>
  peace  <br/>
<br/>
