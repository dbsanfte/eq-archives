<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122851176">Not sure-- any recent patches that might have<br/>
nerfed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although one thing that I do, and I doubt anyone else<br/>
does--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I stick with lower level spells almost always. Even<br/>
if they resist, your spells don&#39;t cost as much mana<br/>
anyway and you fizzle less. It may not be the best way<br/>
but spells are designed to be costly to use when you<br/>
first get them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only level 24 spell I use<br/>
consistantly right now is Wolf form and my rings. I have them<br/>
in case I need them but they&#39;re too mana intensive<br/>
and fizzle more. Wolf form is worth it if you&#39;re<br/>
about to stick and camp for a long time. Improves AC,<br/>
Attack, Damage, AND gives you speed faster than SOW<br/>
provided you don&#39;t zone AND lasts 1 1/2 hours or<br/>
so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, maybe you got lucky and now the spells are being<br/>
resisted more due to regular luck. Or maybe you&#39;ve been<br/>
nerfed in some way and don&#39;t know it. Final suggestion<br/>
is try another zone. Some zones have had mobs get<br/>
upgraded. Perhaps that&#39;s the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS Sorry I&#39;m always so long winded. Hope this helps.<br/>
