<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136814360">Befallen is a good zone for a toon of your level, stay<br/>
close to the zone when fighting and you should be<br/>
alright. as you raise in level work your way in and<br/>
bring havoc to the creatures that lurk in the compound<br/>
stay away from the well of the Damned because the fall<br/>
would either kill you or make you vunerable to the<br/>
25th level shadowknights on the 2nd level, above all<br/>
try to group for better protection. I&#39;m a firm<br/>
believer that you should know all you can about a zone<br/>
before comitting yourself to venturing in it. Buy the<br/>
Everquest Atlas (The Maps of Myrist) and you will have<br/>
a good map of both levels.<br/>

&gt; heheh! Oy I hate <br/>
&gt; taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, I was looking up a quest yesterday and found<br/>
&gt; one I am <br/>
&gt; interested in. Starts in Felwithe talking to the<br/>
&gt; high elf who stands <br/>
&gt; by the water and tells you he is troubled by his<br/>
&gt; son&#39;s disappearance, <br/>
&gt; please talk to someone else. I found that if you go<br/>
&gt; to Befallen and <br/>
&gt; kill a skeletal foreman, it will spawn Sir<br/>
&gt; (something or other starts <br/>
&gt; with an A). I got the directions, etc. He gives you<br/>
&gt; a token you take <br/>
&gt; back and give to the high elf and he gives you his<br/>
&gt; daughter&#39;s token. <br/>
&gt; A pretty cool amulet with 3AC, +3wis, +3int, +3 cha,<br/>
&gt; +3Sta, and +3 <br/>
&gt; agi I do believe. Anyhow....here&#39;s my question...can<br/>
&gt; I make it in <br/>
&gt; Befallen at level 20 ok? I&#39;m scared from what I read<br/>
&gt; to attempt it. <br/>
&gt; Apparently everything aggros terribly. EQAtlas says<br/>
&gt; level 7-25+ mobs, <br/>
&gt; but since they are all necros and thermagists, the<br/>
&gt; damages are much <br/>
&gt; worse than they con. I HATE dying, and I&#39;m too<br/>
&gt; chicken to attempt <br/>
&gt; without some feedback. Any suggestions or stories?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
