<div id="ygrps-yiv-942252956">As a seminar lecturer and former English major, I<br/>
must point out the punctuation and grammar errors in<br/>
the &quot;ex school teacher&#39;s&quot; post. HEHE -- just kidding.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I loved the post!! When talking about loot, though,<br/>
can you bring in &quot;dwarf parts,&quot; &quot;elven blood,&quot;<br/>
&quot;bandit tongue,&quot; or some of the other unique and<br/>
interesting loot items?? How about two slices of bread with<br/>
raw liver in between for a &quot;floglock burger&quot;?<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the consensus is to not overpower what you<br/>
are trying to get across with visual aids, but to<br/>
allow the aids to enhance what your presentation is<br/>
about. If the crowd walks away saying, &quot;Wow! What cool<br/>
pictures!&quot; but not remebering the content of your<br/>
presentation, was it a sucess? (I guess it was if the purpose<br/>
was to show cool pictures). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We live in a<br/>
sound bite world. Many EQ players actually get away<br/>
with that. Many are avid readers and thinkers, and<br/>
have a slightly longer attention span than the common<br/>
mall rat or channel surfer. (I base this on those of<br/>
us who have been on 8 hour camps-- which brings up<br/>
an interesting point - what do you do during long<br/>
camps? Talk to others, practice skills, watch TV, read a<br/>
book?) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The point is, though, that the average<br/>
audience needs &quot;sound bites&quot; and visual aids to help them<br/>
understand and retain a &quot;lecture.&quot; BUT, most people are<br/>
easily distracted and too much visual will usually dwarf<br/>
the content. (See... some of you saw the word &quot;dwarf&quot;<br/>
and immediately lost what I was saying, your mind<br/>
drifing to EQ-- hehe). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My 2cp<br/>
worth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-- Sure, use Barbie for the High Elf Female model,<br/>
but what about us lithe and limber wood elves?? I<br/>
guess you could just use a rock for a dwarf model, eh?</div>
