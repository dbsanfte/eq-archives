<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212581311">Hail, And well me John.  You say you have a vast<br/>
knowledge of Kunark?? well, maybe you can help me.  I<br/>
have a lvl 9 half-elf bard and he is stuck respawning<br/>
in the arena, both surrounding zones are empty, but,<br/>
whenever I try to leave Rathetear Lake I always meet<br/>
up with some gnoll shamans and get slaughtered.... <br/>
One might ask how in all the worlds I got a lvl 9 bard<br/>
safely to The Arena,  Lets just say I abused SoW a<br/>
little, I was spawning in Qeynos, and was trying to<br/>
reach Freeport, and got lost somewhere in the<br/>
middle... Any assistance in theis matter would be<br/>
greatly appreciated,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been at this stoopid game for close to 3<br/>
&gt; years. My crowning <br/>
&gt; achievement so far (150 days played, cause I love to<br/>
&gt; &#39;smell the <br/>
&gt; flowers&#39;) is lvl 60 epiced shaman with complete<br/>
&gt; spellbook<br/>
&gt; (no &#39;Ancient Scrolls&#39; yet) and 25 AA pts. Even after<br/>
&gt; playing EQ for <br/>
&gt; this amount of time there is so much I am unfamiliar<br/>
&gt; with, mostly the <br/>
&gt; old world, feel like newbie often :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do however have humble knowledge of the Barbarian<br/>
&gt; Shaman class, the <br/>
&gt; continent of Antonica and many of the kunark and<br/>
&gt; velious zones. I <br/>
&gt; hang out mostly in luclin zones atm. I belong to a<br/>
&gt; smallish guild (60 <br/>
&gt; members) that I have been in for 2 years (since<br/>
&gt; early 30&#39;s) we are <br/>
&gt; just now approaching some of the higher end<br/>
&gt; encounters.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know I will learn from you folks and hopefully be<br/>
&gt; able to <br/>
&gt; contribute in some humble manner.<br/>
