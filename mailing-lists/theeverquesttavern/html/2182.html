Burned out lighstones!!! name yer price!!!&quot;&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey,<br/>
Xela - just noticed your Rogue&#39;s tagline . . . You&#39;ll<br/>
be happy to know that when you get your poison skill<br/>
up very high, BOLS are an ingredient in a poison<br/>
(forget what it&#39;s called, perhaps visionistic pain;<br/>
sounds like blindness, perhaps?). Unfortunately, you<br/>
would need to carry around the mortar and pestle, plus<br/>
the other ingredients (sealed vial, larent<br/>
suspension, and 2 coyote tails), because the BOLS will poof<br/>
when you camp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have way too much time on my<br/>
hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht, languishing around 28th level</div>
