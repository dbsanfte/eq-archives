<div id="ygrps-yiv-77999828">Hmmmm... some good points, but what about this<br/>
argument. &quot;YOUR twinking ruins MY game, that I pay for&quot; I&#39;m<br/>
not making that argument, but I&#39;ve heard it said. The<br/>
point is, though, now those who don&#39;t like twinks can<br/>
go to other, newer servers-- ie. Sullon and Firiona,<br/>
where there is the TLC and only one char for that<br/>
server. Sure, there will always be those who get multiple<br/>
accounts so they can twink, but it will be less. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
know it&#39;s not ALL twinks, and probably not even a<br/>
large percentage, but I&#39;ve had problems with obvious<br/>
twinks farming, camp stealing, kill stealing, and other<br/>
things. Same or slightly leveled uber twinks can run in<br/>
and solo things that my hard found group is going<br/>
after. /rude on them!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW-- Firiona Vie is a<br/>
must try for those who like to play natural (ie. no<br/>
twinking). Each special weapon/armor piece is sacred AND you<br/>
don&#39;t skip by the great (and underutilized) quests in<br/>
many of the zones in favor of PLing and and spending<br/>
the hundreds of plat that a lvl 10 char would<br/>
normally not have. My level 14 rogue is very proud of his<br/>
mismatched collection of leather armor, 2 pieces of banded,<br/>
and the Freeport Militia Tunic!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are<br/>
right-- to each there own. That doesn&#39;t mean I have to<br/>
like it!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 36th<br/>
