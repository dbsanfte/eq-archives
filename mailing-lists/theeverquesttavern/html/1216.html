<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700452886">I recently was in EC and i had been tryin so hard<br/>
to get my stuff from cazic for my darkforge armor so<br/>
i took a break. Sitting there i saw an auction for<br/>
an SK only helm &quot;Sentient Helm&quot; 14ac 7int 10mana 5<br/>
SvM, so i asked what is the price on the helm, he said<br/>
300pp my jaw drooped. How could it sell that low, I<br/>
thought, then i snapped out of it and bought the dern<br/>
thing. Well i have learned there is a whole suit of this<br/>
&quot;Sentient Armor.&quot; It drops some whenre in velious but<br/>
where? If any one knows plz post or send me an email<br/>
this is BETTER than DF armor. I highly recomend it.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thx all &lt;br&gt;Cireno De&#39;Tenebrae&lt;br&gt;Loyal Knight of<br/>
