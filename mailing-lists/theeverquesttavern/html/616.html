<b>Subject:</b> Today was a fun day... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-751562445">I went LD last night in BB. I logged back on<br/>
today and was jumped by 2 commanders, 2 elites, and a<br/>
shaman. Almost made it out - I died at snake pit. I<br/>
recovered my corpse easily and went out into the hills. I<br/>
had not fought Tovax yet and he conned blue, so I<br/>
jumped him. I took his HP down about halfway, and he<br/>
only hit me for a bubble, then he made me run away<br/>
with a necro spell. I found him again, and he started<br/>
wailing on me. I fought hard but he was too tough. I ran<br/>
to the guards - I was really close to the tower, but<br/>
the bastard backstabbed me. Died twice. After all<br/>
this, I decided to hunt some easy dread corpses at the<br/>
ruins. Instead, Varsoon was there. I ran away. I came<br/>
back later, and he was Varsoon the Undying. Him and<br/>
his pet had lunch of me, despite my best efforts. So<br/>
three deaths in 12 hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Half-elf<br/>
