<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846202384">Well, the new quests have been a topic of much<br/>
debate as of late. What are your opinions, experiences,<br/>
and rants about the new quests? I recently gained the<br/>
Boots of the Reliant with a level 15 cleric. It was<br/>
broing as hell waiting for the items to spawn, and the<br/>
item isn&#39;t that great (Stats of plate with +1 AC and<br/>
+6 against poison) However, it did feel pretty good<br/>
to do it all on my own, with an lower leel character<br/>
too! Also, the armor is golden plate and looks very<br/>
cool ;) So, the wuest and items themselves (For<br/>
clerics, most other classes don&#39;t have it quite so bad)<br/>
were dissapointing, but the satisfaction and looks<br/>
were good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let everyone know your opinions!</div>
