<div id="ygrps-yiv-695668116">Kernel32 is a pain. I have had that happen to me...it is a Windows thing not an EQ thing. Try re-installing Windows over your current Windows. A lot of the time that will fix things. Remember you will lose any screeensavers,etc...you have in your Windows files. And anything you have saved on the desktop. Be sure and do your backups and good luck...:&gt;<br/>
