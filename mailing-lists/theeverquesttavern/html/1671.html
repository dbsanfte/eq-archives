<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623804551">First, check with the Hearwood master in your<br/>
guild-- he will give you the rusty weapons quest. Not a<br/>
great quest, but it&#39;s the only one you&#39;ll get from him.<br/>
I would go to the ranger&#39;s guild to get the quests<br/>
they offer, and maybe even the warrior and rogues<br/>
guild, if they&#39;ll give you the quests (I can&#39;t remember<br/>
if they do, but I got XP from teaming with some<br/>
rogues and warriors who completed those quests with me<br/>
in the group). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is sad that there are not<br/>
many lower level quests for wood-elf druids. Once you<br/>
start ridding the Faydark of the vile orcs (which<br/>
should be your calling in life, if I can preach the word<br/>
of Tunare here...) you will start to find Crushbone<br/>
Belts (and later CB pads once you venture into CB<br/>
itself). The belts are VERY valuable at lower levels, for<br/>
you can travel to Kaladim to show the warriors there<br/>
that you too are in opposition to the evil orcs. Give<br/>
the appropriate dwarf proof that you have vanquished<br/>
4 orcs (by giving him 4 belts) and you will be<br/>
rewarded richly in experience and by an item that you can<br/>
either use, or sell for profit (druid spells don&#39;t come<br/>
cheap!!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, check with the High-Elf cleric&#39;s<br/>
guild. At early levels, most of these snooty clerics<br/>
won&#39;t have much to do with you, BUT remember that both<br/>
of you serve the great will of Tunare. You will get<br/>
a quest to hunt down the evil undead in Faydark<br/>
(decaying skeletons) and bring back 4 sets of bone chips.<br/>
After that, you will be give a much more difficult<br/>
quest involving the rancorous ghasts of the Lesser<br/>
Faydark. Good questng indeed, and not many of Tunare&#39;s<br/>
druids know of this union with the Clerics of<br/>
Felwithe!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Hunting to you!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of<br/>
