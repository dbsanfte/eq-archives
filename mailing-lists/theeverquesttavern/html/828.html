<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987182534">Graphics Settings in Kunark&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am running<br/>
on a P2-266 Machine, w/128M RAM, 16M TNT Video<br/>
Card(running Detonator Drivers with suggested EQ settings),<br/>
Sound Blaster Live Value Sound Card, (2) Hard Drives<br/>
with Program installed on C: and Swap File on D:<br/>
(fixed at 300M), 56K connection (normally connected at<br/>
50.6K).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I am in the old world, I typically have<br/>
everything turned up to full (except Gamma Correction, which<br/>
I run full left all the time), 1024x768<br/>
resolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I enter Kunark, I do the following:&lt;br&gt;-Turn down<br/>
sky to Single Layer (I like the sky, if you don&#39;t<br/>
care, turn this off).&lt;br&gt;-Particle Density - OFF&lt;br&gt;-PC<br/>
Names - OFF&lt;br&gt;-NPC Names - OFF&lt;br&gt;-Video Mode -<br/>
800x600 (Was running 640x480 and moved it up a notch and<br/>
noticed no real significant slow down).&lt;br&gt;-Screens Same<br/>
Resolution - ON&lt;br&gt;-Level of Detail - OFF&lt;br&gt;-Mip Map - OFF<br/>
(I don&#39;t run Glide, it&#39;s always off).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While<br/>
moving around, you can manually adjust the clipping<br/>
plane using the SHIFT - and SHIFT + keys next to the<br/>
BACKSPACE key. This is a change they introduced months ago,<br/>
but almost everyone has forgotten about it. It works<br/>
great. When you are standing around, crank it up to look<br/>
around. During a fight, pull it back. I do this when I<br/>
pull for a group. I turn it up so I can see the mobs,<br/>
I move around until I am in position. I shoot the<br/>
mob, and as I am running back, I pull back the<br/>
clipping plane to about half what I had it, and continue<br/>
to tap it down as I close in on the group, until its<br/>
almost off when I get to the group. Then I adjust it up<br/>
and down during the fight to keep an eye on what is<br/>
going on around me. Takes some getting used to, adding<br/>
these keystrokes into your game play. But as you can<br/>
see, Kunark is meant to thwart the current play style.</div>
