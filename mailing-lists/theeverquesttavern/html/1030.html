<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327151814">Well a guildmate of mine recently purchased a<br/>
Voodoo 5 5000 with 64 MB of VRAM. He runs full<br/>
resolution with all features turned on/maxed with no lag<br/>
whatsoever. EQ runs more smoothly on Voodoo cards because<br/>
they are Glide compliant. Prophet II cards run on<br/>
NVidia GTS Geforce technology. Their drivers are known<br/>
to be quite good, and most people like the full<br/>
screen anti aliasing they offer (smooths out<br/>
pixels/polygons/rough edges on graphics), but EQ tends to run better on<br/>
Voodoo cards. So really it&#39;s either way, whichever you<br/>
prefer and are willing to buy.</div>
