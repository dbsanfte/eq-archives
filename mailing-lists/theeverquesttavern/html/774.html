<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945971325">Ok, after talking with a SK friend of mine to<br/>
some extent I&#39;m going to have to revise my position on<br/>
the Paladin vs SK issue. It depends on a lot of<br/>
things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are we discussing a PvP server, or a<br/>
pre-meditated (planned) duel on the regular servers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If<br/>
we talking about a Duel, then is it an agreed<br/>
&quot;duel-to-the-death&quot; or is escape an option?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I played on Rallos<br/>
for about 12 levels, but I won&#39;t pretend to know all<br/>
the intricacies of amushing, and other PvP issues. So<br/>
I&#39;ll only talk about the dueling issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If<br/>
escape is an option, then I doubt the SK could actually<br/>
kill the Paladin before he could escape. But this<br/>
scenario doesn&#39;t even make sense. Did the Paladin not know<br/>
about Shadow Step? If so, then I don&#39;t think he was<br/>
prepared, which negates the previous assumptions (that the<br/>
duel was pre-planned).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that brings us to the<br/>
last scenario. Pre-planned duel to the<br/>
death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spells and special abilities will decide it,<br/>
since we have to assume the melee ability of each will<br/>
be equal. (both human with same stats and equipment)<br/>
I&#39;ll assume level 30 for this discussion. I kinda just<br/>
grabbed this level out of thin air. Maybe it&#39;d change at<br/>
later levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow, at level 30 here are the<br/>
notable dueling spells for each<br/>
class:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paladin&lt;br&gt;Symbol of Transal - +73HP, pre-duel (0 mana)&lt;br&gt;Spirit<br/>
Armor - +14AC, pre-duel (0 mana)&lt;br&gt;Center - +6AC<br/>
+85HP, pre-duel (0 mana)&lt;br&gt;Endure Poison - +25 vs<br/>
Poison, pre-duel (0 mana)&lt;br&gt;Healing - 100HP, 60<br/>
mana&lt;br&gt;Stun - Stuns target, 35 mana&lt;br&gt;Root - you know, 30<br/>
mana&lt;br&gt;Yaulp - +6AC +10STR, 5 mana&lt;br&gt;Flash of Light - blinds<br/>
target, 12 mana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...ack, I gotta go. Real life work<br/>
calls. I&#39;ll try finishing this post later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shadow<br/>
Step is a major issue, but I believ Flash of Light<br/>
could be too. It turns into a mental game. The Paladin<br/>
is slowed (engulfing darkness), the SK is rooted<br/>
(and pet) and blind. Does the paladin attempt to close<br/>
the distance on the SK or med and heal? Does the the<br/>
SK use hot keys to cast spells on the paladin or<br/>
shadow step until blindness wares off?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;d like<br/>
to hear your comments. I&#39;ll check back<br/>
later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>
