<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033135196">I&#39;m not sure exactly what all the original message said, but by far....there is NO PLACE in all of Norrath that even comes close to the xp you get in Paludal from level 17-24.  You can easily make a level an hour there with a good group and no matter what server, there are always groups open in Paludal. =)  Once you hit 24 - 29 is up for grabs....never found any one place better than the other xp-wise.  At 29 head to Velious and get to Crystal Caverns.  Get to the &quot;town&quot; inside the caverns and you can either get with a group or solo relatively easily here (if solo&#39;ing, stay close to town and know when to run!)  I solo&#39;d for 3 levels there as a Cleric! =)  I have an enchanter friend that stayed from 29 all the way to 42!! LOL  I would leave around 36-39 and head to Sol B...you can stay in Sol B until high 40&#39;s if you want.  =)  Also, being a Ranger....you can go to the Dreadlands and Root/Dot Yeti&#39;s very very safely if you need to solo...not much loot, but very good xp for levels 38-45.  Those seem to be the absolute best xp places for their respective levels.  Good luck!! =)<br/>
