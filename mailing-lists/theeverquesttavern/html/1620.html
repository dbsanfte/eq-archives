<div id="ygrps-yiv-568616897">Huh? I live mainly on the sleepy Drinal server,<br/>
where there has been little hint of all these<br/>
high-powered goings on. I&#39;ve heard a few things, mainly from<br/>
Everlore, but didn&#39;t think it had anything to do with<br/>
Norrath in general. I did buy one of those news scrolls<br/>
from the new NPC&#39;s that popped up everywhere about a<br/>
week ago -- do those have anything to do with all of<br/>
this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gotta get my Dwarf a magic weapon, I<br/>
guess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;12th season rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
