<b>Subject:</b> SK&#39;s of Pallies? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749194044">I was wondering, at level 50, who would win, a<br/>
Shadow Knight or a Paladin? I know SK&#39;s have harm touch,<br/>
but Pallies have Lay Hands. I was just wondering in<br/>
anyone actually knew which would win(assuming that both<br/>
char&#39;s were of the same race)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Withsedes</div>
