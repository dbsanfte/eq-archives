<b>Subject:</b> Staff Segment quest Highkeep <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819667665">Has anyone got any info on this quest? The first<br/>
segment comes as loot from the named bandit in E Karana,<br/>
along with HK 401 key. When this key is turned in in<br/>
Highkeep, you receive the second segment. I have looked<br/>
everywhere and talked to quite a few people, and nobody can<br/>
seem to get the staff assembled. The most rampant<br/>
rumor is that it is a Battle Staff (ugh).</div>
