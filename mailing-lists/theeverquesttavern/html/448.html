<div id="ygrps-yiv-567648577">Kyrianie! So nice to see you posting.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Congratulations again on level. I hope you got it back.<br/>
;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lake Rathe is an oustanding place to hunt...I stayed<br/>
there from 20-25, in group and solo. From there,<br/>
consider the Keep in HighPass Hold before moving on to<br/>
Cazic. You can fight in the Keep from 23-35, and then<br/>
start checking Cazic at about 25+. Cazic is good<br/>
hunting, but you can&#39;t beat the Keep for experience. Of<br/>
course, having food, merchants, and a bank right upstairs<br/>
makes it all the more appealing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send me a tell<br/>
in game if you&#39;re inclined. I&#39;d like to hear from<br/>
you again. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May Tunare guide your way and<br/>
bless you always.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Murial Mayere&lt;br&gt;Druid of<br/>
Kelethin</div>
