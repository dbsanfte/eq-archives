<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672911158">So I just got EQ a week ago and i am completly<br/>
addicted. So Monday night I was going through some serious<br/>
EQ joneses but got through by thinking about how I<br/>
will be able to play on Tuesday and things will be<br/>
better then before...WRONG!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First it took me an<br/>
hour to patch and get on last night (That&#39;s with a DSL<br/>
connection!) then once I get in there, every time I click on<br/>
any menu my screen shakes like crazy, making it<br/>
almost imposible to read. Then when I click on done to<br/>
go back to the combat menu...I loose the entire menu<br/>
around the view display! I am so mad! I just hope EQ<br/>
gets all the bugs worked out of it and soon! Otherwise<br/>
I am switching to dark ages of Camelot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CJ</div>
