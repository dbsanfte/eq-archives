<div id="ygrps-yiv-281422600">I, too, play on Drinal -- I think because I came<br/>
here before I started to play, and the name then<br/>
looked familiar when I had to choose a server. I am but<br/>
a lowly Rogue who doesn&#39;t even know how to backstab<br/>
yet, and I spend a lot of time in Butcherblock. Say<br/>
hello if you see that I&#39;m online. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
Kaladim&lt;br&gt;8th season Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
