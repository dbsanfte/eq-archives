<div id="ygrps-yiv-562610997">Verant made some classes that are easier to play<br/>
and level but can be a little monotenous and some<br/>
classes that are hard to solo with or level but have<br/>
little perks that make them interesting. Ofcoase some<br/>
classes seem like there both at first but end up pretty<br/>
straight forward later. Most people will end up playing<br/>
more than one character any way which is the beauty of<br/>
this game because it gives a totally different<br/>
experience for the same situation. We all know theres only<br/>
so many different ways you can kill a MOB and I<br/>
think verants done a good job of fleshing that out.</div>
