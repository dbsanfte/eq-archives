<div id="ygrps-yiv-99591532">Creating aggro for me? NO problem:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.<br/>
Snare. The beasties hate it.&lt;br&gt;2. Flame Lick. They hate<br/>
that just as bad. For some reason Flame Lick creates<br/>
more hate than just about any other dot until you get<br/>
into the 40&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;3. Taunt. Lots of it. All the<br/>
time.&lt;br&gt;4. Journeyman&#39;s Walking Stick. Procs Tashani, which<br/>
creates a HUGE amount of aggro. Really pisses &#39;em<br/>
off.&lt;br&gt;5. Don&#39;t stop hittin&#39; &#39;em!!&lt;br&gt;6. Taking damage. As<br/>
a ranger, I&#39;m going to get hit alot. Not as much as<br/>
most, because my AC is pretty damned high, but still<br/>
more than a warrior, pally, or SK of my level. Taking<br/>
damage from a creature creates hate. The lower you are<br/>
on life, the more likely they&#39;re going to continue<br/>
whaling on you until you&#39;re dead.&lt;br&gt;7. DS. I always<br/>
throw a damage shield up on myself before a tough<br/>
fight. My barbcoat + thistleshield does 8 damage each<br/>
time they hit me. Doesn&#39;t sound like much, but it adds<br/>
up. The mob hits me 20 times in a fight? That&#39;s 160<br/>
points of damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s about it. Rangers are<br/>
VERY good at creating and keeping aggro. You just have<br/>
to time your casting and taunts right, and you have<br/>
to have a group that understands how to manage their<br/>
own aggro.</div>
