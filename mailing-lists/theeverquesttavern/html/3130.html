<b>Subject:</b> Leaving Private Guild Channel Help <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-571132607">I need to know what the command is to Permantly leave a Private Guild <br/>
Channel. I have tried /leaveall but when I log back in the channel is <br/>
there again. Nothing I have tried in game from GM has worked. I can&#39;t <br/>
even speak to NPCs because everything I say goes directly into the <br/>
channel because I Auto Joined this channel. I can speak /ooc but that <br/>
is it. There has to be some kind of command for this other than going <br/>
into my EQ comp files. Anyone have any GOOD Guild URLs with this type <br/>
of info?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Mari</div>
