<div id="ygrps-yiv-962373782">I use Roleplay all the time. I guess as a Rogue,<br/>
no one ever really wants anything from me, so I<br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s an issue of not wanting to help<br/>
people. I just think of it as more appropriate -- in real<br/>
life, people don&#39;t walk around with profession-tags to<br/>
announce what they do for a living, so in EQ I prefer to<br/>
let people guess. When I pop up out of nowhere, of<br/>
course, that&#39;s usually a clue, as is the puny little<br/>
dagger (Giant Snake Fang) I use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
