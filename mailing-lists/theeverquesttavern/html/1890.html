<div id="ygrps-yiv-936092059">Maybe not appropriate here, but it sickens me...I<br/>
have been playing EQ since release, and I am very<br/>
discouraged with the change of the attitudes of most people<br/>
that play now. To make it short...A guy/friend of mine<br/>
in my guild for about 8 months wanted to borrow my<br/>
Talon&#39;s Bracer, cuz i wasn&#39;t really playing my ranger at<br/>
the time, i said sure, just want it back sometime in<br/>
the near future. Well, a few months later I asked for<br/>
it back, he said np, come to KC...I said i cannot i<br/>
have to log, will get it tomorrow, he said np. WELL!!!<br/>
he never logged on for 3 days, and when he did, he<br/>
left my guild and stole my F&#39;n bracer! Maybe a bit<br/>
stupid on my part, but 2 years ago, I would have been<br/>
hard pressed to find someone to pull that shit!<br/>
sigh.....not to mention 40 attempts yesterday on my account<br/>
being hacked! WTF. okay lol i will calm down now =)</div>
