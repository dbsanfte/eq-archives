<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548961041">1) Yep... based on exp at the time and percentage<br/>
based as far as I remember. So the higher in a level<br/>
you are.. .the more exp you lose. Eep!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2)<br/>
Animals... as a druid, I don&#39;t believe you lose exp.<br/>
However, usually you lose faction. Eventually, bears and<br/>
wolves that are normally amiable to you will probably go<br/>
up to you and bite ya. LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now there really<br/>
aren&#39;t that many animals that are amiable to you<br/>
anyway.. BUT... I do it b/c I don&#39;t like to kill bears and<br/>
wolves that are a druid&#39;s friend. Grin. Why kill things<br/>
that have good faction to ya?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Animal faction is<br/>
rough though. I&#39;ve never noticed a msg about Animal<br/>
faction decreasing... but gradually.. they start to hate<br/>
ya bad!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic</div>
