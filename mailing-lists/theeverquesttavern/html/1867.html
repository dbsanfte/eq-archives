<b>Subject:</b> Twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949342687">I think some twinking is ok. Not huge leaps like<br/>
the 200 int caster some talk about. I am talking<br/>
minor twinks...like starting a new character with maybe<br/>
10pp. You know, enough to buy basic equipment right<br/>
from the start. First level spells for instance..maybe<br/>
basic armor and weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just recently started<br/>
playing EQ so no self twinking yet. However, I have been<br/>
given items and money from high level characters...is<br/>
this considered twinking? Someone doing something nice<br/>
just because they could? I am not sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
really don&#39;t know if i would twink myself..the game is<br/>
just too darn fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calidiel Shapeshyfter 20th<br/>
