<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-523378413">Kelethin eh? Well first of all id save up for a<br/>
fine steel weapon, maybe a fine steel scimitar or long<br/>
sword. They usually sell for around 3-5pp not too bad<br/>
for a pretty good weapon. If not that go for a forged<br/>
weapon which can be made by player s with skill in<br/>
Blacksmithing. Thats all i could think of for now, i hope it<br/>
helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Drentok, Gemchopper of 31 seasons&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-Dont be<br/>
afraid to hunt orcs with your rusty weapon, you will do<br/>
fine, they aren&#39;t that tough. ;)</div>
