<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023048415">No increase in my lag, but I have had an increase in how often eq <br/>
disconnects me. It went from maybe once a month to almost every time <br/>
I log in. Usually after the first disconnect my connection stays <br/>
solid for the rest of the evening. <br/>
<br/>
I have had it stick my courser in the upper left corner at the <br/>
character select screen now. Never had that happen until the patch. <br/>
Hopefully today&#39;s patch fixes some of this.<br/>

&gt; Anyone having or had this problem? </span></blockquote></div>
