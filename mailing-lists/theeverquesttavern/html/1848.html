<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933283277">I totally agree. I&#39;m not in everquest yet, but I<br/>
will be soon. You&#39;re right, people can get pretty assy<br/>
and pretty rude. It reflects their rl personality<br/>
(Even though it&#39;s much more fun to make up a diff one<br/>
than your real one)and they do really need to remember<br/>
common courtesy. Those of you who don&#39;t have the<br/>
strategy guide (I have the Ruins of Kunark), then you<br/>
should buy it and read it. In the one I have it says<br/>
&quot;EverQuest is too big to let someone spoil your day&quot;(or<br/>
somehting like that). It&#39;s under the ettiquet. Still, next<br/>
time try telling them that some rude person is<br/>
beginning to be a huge pain in the posterior. If they don&#39;t<br/>
quit, well, then tell them to pull that tree branch<br/>
that got caught in their ass when they were in<br/>
Kelethin and get over it. And I must say, good day to you<br/>
all!&lt;br&gt;Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ^_^`</div>
