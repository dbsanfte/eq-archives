<div id="ygrps-yiv-95506396">Things are slow here -- thanks for picking them<br/>
up!! Re: etiguette-- If the corpses were there long<br/>
enough for you to be able to loot them without someone<br/>
coming back, i&#39;d say you didn&#39;t &lt;br&gt;&quot;steal&quot; anything.<br/>
Especially with the tongues - I loved beating on those dwarf<br/>
bandits, but I was a wood-elf druid and didn&#39;t know<br/>
how/where to turn in the tongues, so I always just left<br/>
them there for someone else who could use them.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are different messages on yellows, blues and<br/>
greens, depending on how &quot;blue&quot; (etc.) they are. There is<br/>
a rating system in the Kunark Guidebook that<br/>
explains this (ie. one of the messages means that the MOB<br/>
is 1-2 lvls lower than you, while the other message<br/>
means 3-4 lvls lower than you, or something like that).<br/>
If you&#39;re still curious on that, or no one else can<br/>
post specifics, i&#39;ll check out the book and post what<br/>
i find.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Hunting-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;17th<br/>
season Druid&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>
