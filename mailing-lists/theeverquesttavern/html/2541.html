<b>Subject:</b> Ok question on comp specs? :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193734178">It seems that my questions are not getting less,<br/>
but rather more frequent in nature. Ok, I was<br/>
watching my comp when it was booting up. How much more mem<br/>
will I need to acuire if it says that it has 98304K?<br/>
I&#39;m pretty certain that I have a pentium 2 as my<br/>
friend bought that for me (and the pen 3 was just out so<br/>
it was all I could afford). I know that video and<br/>
sound cards are a must and they have already been<br/>
discussed so no need to open that can of worms. :) Well I<br/>
think that I have exhausted my brain&#39;s staying power<br/>
for the night (Need more coffee!) so I will say &#39;A<br/>
merry night to you. Catcha later.&#39; The Raven</div>
