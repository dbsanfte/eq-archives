I have a 32 Barb Shammy and I am wondering when can I start my Epic? And<br/>
aside from hunting the HG in RM where can I go to get good xp and cash so I<br/>
can finance my Alchemy materials as well as save up for spells and such?<br/>
Also what are the Ancient Scrolls? and when can they be gone after?<br/>

&gt; Hail,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been at this stoopid game for close to 3 years. My crowning<br/>
&gt; achievement so far (150 days played, cause I love to &#39;smell the<br/>
&gt; flowers&#39;) is lvl 60 epiced shaman with complete spellbook<br/>
&gt; (no &#39;Ancient Scrolls&#39; yet) and 25 AA pts. Even after playing EQ for<br/>
&gt; this amount of time there is so much I am unfamiliar with, mostly the<br/>
&gt; old world, feel like newbie often :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do however have humble knowledge of the Barbarian Shaman class, the<br/>
&gt; continent of Antonica and many of the kunark and velious zones. I<br/>
&gt; hang out mostly in luclin zones atm. I belong to a smallish guild (60<br/>
&gt; members) that I have been in for 2 years (since early 30&#39;s) we are<br/>
&gt; just now approaching some of the higher end encounters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know I will learn from you folks and hopefully be able to<br/>
&gt; contribute in some humble manner.<br/>
