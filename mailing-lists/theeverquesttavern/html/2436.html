<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578829996">They upgraded the system requirements. Take a<br/>
look at the various sources cause I don&#39;t know exactly<br/>
what the new requirements are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also depends<br/>
on what you have enabled in terms of textures. I<br/>
have most of my SoL textures turned off b/c I have<br/>
only a 500mhtz computer with a Voodoo3 and 196 memory.<br/>
Runs okay though. =)So long as I do that. You might<br/>
try calling their tech support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
