<br/>
Sure you can. However, you probably want to take a friend or two with to cover your back. <br/>
I would offer my services, and actually have a character on your server, but I don&#39;t think my 9th lvl Dwarven Cleric would be of much help for you on your quest. If you&#39;d like, I have some friends on that server who maybe able to help. I&#39;ll check it out for you. Ok?<br/>

&gt;taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyhow, I was looking up a quest yesterday and found one I am <br/>
&gt;interested in. Starts in Felwithe talking to the high elf who stands <br/>
&gt;by the water and tells you he is troubled by his son&#39;s disappearance, <br/>
&gt;please talk to someone else. I found that if you go to Befallen and <br/>
&gt;kill a skeletal foreman, it will spawn Sir (something or other starts <br/>
&gt;with an A). I got the directions, etc. He gives you a token you take <br/>
&gt;back and give to the high elf and he gives you his daughter&#39;s token. <br/>
&gt;A pretty cool amulet with 3AC, +3wis, +3int, +3 cha, +3Sta, and +3 <br/>
&gt;agi I do believe. Anyhow....here&#39;s my question...can I make it in <br/>
&gt;Befallen at level 20 ok? I&#39;m scared from what I read to attempt it. <br/>
&gt;Apparently everything aggros terribly. EQAtlas says level 7-25+ mobs, <br/>
&gt;but since they are all necros and thermagists, the damages are much <br/>
&gt;worse than they con. I HATE dying, and I&#39;m too chicken to attempt <br/>
&gt;without some feedback. Any suggestions or stories?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks!<br/>
