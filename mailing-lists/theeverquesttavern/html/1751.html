<div id="ygrps-yiv-772300811">Kharl-- the tutorial is part of the game load--<br/>
you should try it, as it&#39;s pretty fun and funny. I<br/>
bet it took you awhile to figure out the game<br/>
mechanics w/o the tutorial-- even WITH doing it twice, i<br/>
still took some time before i got the hang of all the<br/>
different commands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You actually thought you were<br/>
only going to play for a month?? I wanted to get onto<br/>
EQ for about 6months before i did (had to get a new<br/>
computer to play it). I realized back then (and more so<br/>
after day one of playing) that it would be a commitment<br/>
of several years-- hahaha). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>
