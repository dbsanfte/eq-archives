<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048747727">As a follower of &quot;The Craft,&quot; I wanted to inform you that witchcraft <br/>
IS a religion...in a way. The pagan religion of Wicca is often <br/>
referred to as The Craft or Witchcraft. Many of the findings of <br/>
witchcraft in other religions have been borrowed from Wicca. Such as <br/>
the traditional Easter celebrations. Easter is derived from Eostra, <br/>
which is the Wiccan celebration that falls around the time of <br/>
Easter. Wiccans would paint eggs to celebrate the fertility of the <br/>
goddess. Christmas also borrows traditions from Wicca&#39;s Yule, which <br/>
falls at the end of December. Even the common appearance of Satan <br/>
was pulled from Wicca. When Christianity came to be, christians <br/>
portrayed Satan as a demonic creature with horns. This was done to <br/>
try to bastardize Wicca, because one of the gods worshipped in the <br/>
religion had horns. Of course, this varies from practitioner to <br/>
practitioner, as Wicca is a &quot;free-form&quot; religion with not many <br/>
things set in stone.<br/>
