<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417853600">Yes. You can lose levels. Once you get above 6th<br/>
if I remeber correctly. You only can lose a level if<br/>
you lose enough experience to lower your experience<br/>
bar below the current level minimum. You lose<br/>
experience when you die. So don&#39;t die! Also, just because<br/>
you leveled, don&#39;t change your hunting area right<br/>
away. Get yourself a cushion of experience. How much?<br/>
Depends on your level. Currently, I am a 24 warrior and<br/>
if/when I die, I will lose three blue bubbles of<br/>
experience. I have yet to notice a loss of stats/skills from<br/>
losing a level (went from 19 to 20 and back way too many<br/>
times) but your skills will not advance to the maximum<br/>
of the higher level until you regain it. I.e. one<br/>
hand slash is at 121 out of 125 (level x 5<br/>
+5)(24x5+5). I am barely 24, I die. The experience loss is<br/>
enough to take me back to 23. My skill stays 116 even<br/>
though it is above the max for that level (23x5+5=120).<br/>
It will not go up any until I regain the level which<br/>
increases the cap. &lt;br&gt; The guards will not know that you<br/>
killed that particular person. If you had any faction<br/>
adjustments from the kill (freeport militia goes down,<br/>
knights of truth goes up, unseen hands goes down, etc)<br/>
then those groups like or hate you just a little more.<br/>
Always pay attention to faction. /c when in doubt! I was<br/>
kos in ButcherBlock alll because I worshipped Rallos<br/>
Zek. Now I&#39;m amiable!&lt;br&gt; As for the epic, you need to<br/>
be very experienced. Say 50 ish. Ask the npc&#39;s in<br/>
the game. You&#39;ll never know what you&#39;ll find<br/>
out!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keiyuki</div>
