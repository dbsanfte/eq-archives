<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047376080">Admittedly there are a LOT of places you could<br/>
kill but the best depend on where you are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most<br/>
commonly people kill around entrance to Crushbone or<br/>
inside CB around 7,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or they go to East Commons<br/>
and kill animals and insects or camp orcs there at<br/>
level 7.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EC is safer in terms of a place to<br/>
kill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re 7, I&#39;d recommend a full decent group or<br/>
someone higher level to watch your back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I take a<br/>
few of my guildmates in CB when they&#39;re lower levels<br/>
and PL them in there. TOO many players now a days<br/>
play in so many other places that CB trains are almost<br/>
a nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Used to be CB was overcrowded.<br/>
Now it&#39;s sparce and you have to be very careful.<br/>
People playing in CB these days seem too pell mell.<br/>
Lotsa people that I try to train but never<br/>
learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When your only healing in the group is two rangers--<br/>
and your enchanter of level 7 says, &quot;Stay put-- our<br/>
two tanks are at less than 3 bubs of health.&quot;<br/>
followed by &quot;40&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Used to be USUALLY when I said it<br/>
in CB. People realized I meant I had 40 mana, and<br/>
there&#39;s no real healing-- stay put before<br/>
pulling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now a days, for some reason, I see my two tanks run<br/>
off and pull. Not once. Not twice. But three<br/>
times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First time was a Leg, second was 3 slavers, third was 2<br/>
legs and a slaver. Then I have everyone hold up on CB<br/>
safe ledge... I see a train run by and the guy sees a<br/>
group on the ledge and actually turns into me and runs<br/>
off as it kills me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alright, I hate that I<br/>
rant about this BUT...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHY??? Do I sound pushy<br/>
when I tell my group firmly &quot;stay put&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Come<br/>
on. I might be a newbie essentially still, but I&#39;ve<br/>
also learned a lot about grouping and used to kill in<br/>
CB forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>
Prismatic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... yes. I know. Sigh. Sorry. I gotta learn to stop<br/>
ranting at times.</div>
