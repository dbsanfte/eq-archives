<b>Subject:</b> Shammie Barb needs help <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952491842">I am back from a four month hiatus because of a move. Since I am back <br/>
with the game and I have yet to find my EQ books and that notes that <br/>
are sitll pack away somewhere, I am looking for a place to send my <br/>
lvl 22 Shammie Barb for a good hunt. My character right now is in E. <br/>
Commonlands. Any advice or suggestions would be helpful as I get back <br/>
into the game. Thanks for your help.<br/>
