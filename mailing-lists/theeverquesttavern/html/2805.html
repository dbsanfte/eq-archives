To:  The Salisbury Post, North Carolina <br/>
We, the undersigned, are outraged at the refusal of a request to list <br/>
a Pagan/Wiccan Study Group - Magickal Moon in the Salisbury Post, <br/>
which is located in Salisbury, North Carolina. The reason given for <br/>
the request by the FAITH Copy Editor was both ignorant and <br/>
discriminatory. &quot;The Salisbury Post FAITH section is for people who <br/>
believe in God&quot; and &quot;this is not the image that The Post wants to <br/>
portray.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The Salisbury Post&#39;s mission statement says in part: <br/>
&quot;We are a marketing and customer driven company whose mission is to <br/>
inform, educate and entertain. We strive to mirror the unique <br/>
communities we serve and offer responsible public forum.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We fail to see how denying a Pagan/Wiccan study group an equal space <br/>
with other congregations fulfills this mission statement. The <br/>
decision was made with personal prejudices and not handled with a <br/>
professional demeanor. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless of whether or not Paganism is The Salisbury Post&#39;s <br/>
religion, it is our religion. The Federal Government recognizes <br/>
Paganism/Wicca, as an official religion. Military Courts of Justice <br/>
in the U.S. have also found Wicca to be a valid religion, deserving <br/>
of protection under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In <br/>
the case United States v. Phillips, (42 M.J. 346) in 1995) the <br/>
concurring opinion by Judge Wiss stated: &quot;First, Wicca is a socially <br/>
recognized religion. It is acknowledged as such by the Army. <br/>
See `Dept. of the Army (DA) Pamphlet 165-13-1, Religious Requirements <br/>
and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains&#39; <br/>
(April 1980), revising A Pamphlet 165-13, `Religious Requirements and <br/>
Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains&#39; <br/>
(April 1978). Further, it is acknowledged as such in courts of law.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Pagans and Wiccans are a part of your community. We are your <br/>
neighbors, your coworkers, your children&#39;s teachers; we are <br/>
professionals, but most importantly we are your readers - your <br/>
customers! As engraved on your building and imprinted on the <br/>
Opinion/Editorial page of the paper &quot;The truth shall make you free&quot;; <br/>
misconceptions about pagans, and being denied access to public forum <br/>
makes it all the more difficult for the truth to make any of us free. <br/>
<br/>
Due to the fact that this request was handled in an unprofessional <br/>
manner and with personal bigotry, we, the undersigned, as well as <br/>
members of our family and friends, who are both of the Christian and <br/>
Pagan faith will not support The Salisbury Post. We will no longer be <br/>
a part of your readership until this matter is reconciled with a <br/>
formal apology and the list is made public in The Salisbury Post. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are not evil. We don&#39;t harm or seduce people. We are not <br/>
dangerous. We are ordinary people like you. We have families, jobs, <br/>
hopes, and dreams. We are not a cult. This religion is not a joke. We <br/>
are not what you think we are from looking at T.V. We are real. We <br/>
laugh, we cry. We are serious. We have a sense of humor. You don&#39;t <br/>
have to be afraid of us. We don&#39;t want to convert you. And please <br/>
don&#39;t try to convert us. Just give us the same right we give you--to <br/>
live in peace. We are much more similar to you than you think.&quot; - <br/>
Margot Adler <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   In my opinion (key phrase) witchcraft without<br/>
&gt;   religious backing is like morality without religious<br/>
&gt;   backing.  Without any provocation or compelling force<br/>
&gt;   behind it, it is little more than science and should<br/>
&gt;   not be labled &quot;witchcraft&quot;.  And, on another note,<br/>
&gt;   certification in astrology, other than a historical<br/>
&gt;   study CANNOT be deemed scientific without results<br/>
&gt;   which may be CONSISTANTLY reproduced.  Use the same<br/>
&gt;   formula and you will get the same results every time. <br/>
&gt;   Let it be known, I try to offend no one, and my<br/>
&gt;   statements are mearly speculation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Psyko =P peace out<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Tue Oct 8,10:23 PM ET<br/>
&gt;   &gt; By Julia Ferguson <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; KLAGENFURT, Austria (Reuters) - You won&#39;t learn how<br/>
&gt;   &gt; to fly a <br/>
&gt;   &gt; broomstick or cast spells with the flick of a wand,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; but a potent dose <br/>
&gt;   &gt; of grit and study will turn you into a witch,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; promises Europe&#39;s first <br/>
&gt;   &gt; School of Witchcraft. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; The school in the southern Austrian city of<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Klagenfurt might sound <br/>
&gt;   &gt; hocus-pocus, but those looking to emulate fictional<br/>
&gt;   &gt; young wizard <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Harry Potter (news - web sites) will be a mite<br/>
&gt;   &gt; disappointed: the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; curriculum is downright scientific, and eye of newt<br/>
&gt;   &gt; is nowhere to be <br/>
&gt;   &gt; seen. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Headmaster Andreas Starchel, who prefers to be<br/>
&gt;   &gt; called by his druid <br/>
&gt;   &gt; name Danaketh, said he established the school to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; demystify witchcraft <br/>
&gt;   &gt; by explaining phenomena using scientific methods<br/>
&gt;   &gt; from physics, <br/>
&gt;   &gt; chemistry, and biology. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;Everything that is taught and learned at our school<br/>
&gt;   &gt; can be proven <br/>
&gt;   &gt; using natural scientific and psychological methods,&quot;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; he told Reuters <br/>
&gt;   &gt; during a training session in the woods. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;We teach everything needed to become a real witch<br/>
&gt;   &gt; in the historical <br/>
&gt;   &gt; sense -- that is to have an all-encompassing<br/>
&gt;   &gt; knowledge of nature and <br/>
&gt;   &gt; a highly developed sense of intuition. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;Being a witch is not inborn. Anyone can learn to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; become one,&quot; he <br/>
&gt;   &gt; added. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Practitioners of witchcraft focus on the good in<br/>
&gt;   &gt; life and the spirit, <br/>
&gt;   &gt; and reject any connection with the devil, Starchel<br/>
&gt;   &gt; said. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Since their beliefs date back to ancient times well<br/>
&gt;   &gt; before the birth <br/>
&gt;   &gt; of Jesus, witchcraft has no bond with the Christian<br/>
&gt;   &gt; embodiment of <br/>
&gt;   &gt; evil. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;Witchcraft has got absolutely nothing to do with<br/>
&gt;   &gt; the folklore image <br/>
&gt;   &gt; of evil witches with green faces and warts on their<br/>
&gt;   &gt; nose. It&#39;s about <br/>
&gt;   &gt; becoming a rounded person who lives in harmony with<br/>
&gt;   &gt; nature,&quot; said the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; goatee-bearded druid. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; NO HOCUS-POCUS NOR HUNKUM BUNKUM <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; The headmaster stressed that his school, established<br/>
&gt;   &gt; in 1998 for <br/>
&gt;   &gt; wannabe witches and druids of 18 years and above,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; has no ties with <br/>
&gt;   &gt; religious organisations nor follows any esoteric<br/>
&gt;   &gt; movement. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; The syllabus originally lasted three years but has<br/>
&gt;   &gt; now been revised <br/>
&gt;   &gt; to a more flexible form to suit students&#39; busy time<br/>
&gt;   &gt; schedules. In a <br/>
&gt;   &gt; sign of the times, it teaches courses over the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Internet as most of <br/>
&gt;   &gt; its students live outside Austria. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; A student graduates with a venefica or veneficus<br/>
&gt;   &gt; (from the Latin for <br/>
&gt;   &gt; witch/druid) certificate after passing written exams<br/>
&gt;   &gt; in seven modules <br/>
&gt;   &gt; and submitting a final thesis. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; The first module focuses on awakening intuition,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; specifically on how <br/>
&gt;   &gt; to find sources of energy in nature and how to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; channel it. Other <br/>
&gt;   &gt; modules are astronomy, astrology, botany, holistic<br/>
&gt;   &gt; healing and ritual <br/>
&gt;   &gt; magic. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Curriculum information on the school website<br/>
&gt;   &gt; www.hexen-schule.de <br/>
&gt;   &gt; shows there are no modules like the Defence Against<br/>
&gt;   &gt; the Dark Arts <br/>
&gt;   &gt; class which Harry Potter had to take in the Hogwarts<br/>
&gt;   &gt; School of <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;Some wannabe witches and druids are turned off<br/>
&gt;   &gt; enrolling with us <br/>
&gt;   &gt; when we tell them that our aim is to demystify<br/>
&gt;   &gt; witchcraft,&quot; said <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Starchel, who is an information technology<br/>
&gt;   &gt; specialist by profession. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;People do approach us hoping to learn how to fly on<br/>
&gt;   &gt; a broomstick. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Then we have to disappoint them and explain that<br/>
&gt;   &gt; it&#39;s much more <br/>
&gt;   &gt; important to let the spirit fly -- to be able to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; combine intellect <br/>
&gt;   &gt; with the soul.&quot; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; The school has received a huge fillip from the Harry<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Potter books by <br/>
&gt;   &gt; J.K. Rowling (news - web sites) and television<br/>
&gt;   &gt; series such as Sabrina <br/>
&gt;   &gt; the Teenage Witch. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;We actually had kids phoning up asking whether they<br/>
&gt;   &gt; could ditch <br/>
&gt;   &gt; their school and enrol with us,&quot; Starchel said. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; THE WITCHES OF KLAGENFURT <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Student witch Katharina, a bespectacled middle-aged<br/>
&gt;   &gt; librarian by day <br/>
&gt;   &gt; who asked to be identified only by her witch name,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; said she was drawn <br/>
&gt;   &gt; to the course because something was missing from her<br/>
&gt;   &gt; life. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;I was looking for direction. Christianity was too<br/>
&gt;   &gt; narrow for me and <br/>
&gt;   &gt; didn&#39;t give me the answers I needed,&quot; she said after<br/>
&gt;   &gt; completing a <br/>
&gt;   &gt; session of chakra meditation with Danaketh. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Chakras are the seven key energy centres of the body<br/>
&gt;   &gt; according to <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Indian medicine. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;I was a bit sceptical at first but what impressed<br/>
&gt;   &gt; me is that it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;   &gt; not about belief or faith as in the church. The<br/>
&gt;   &gt; school offers <br/>
&gt;   &gt; plausible explanations for phenomena based on fact<br/>
&gt;   &gt; -- there&#39;s no <br/>
&gt;   &gt; hocus-pocus,&quot; Katharina said. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Katharina, who travels from Salzburg in the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; northwest of the country <br/>
&gt;   &gt; to attend the school&#39;s seminars, proudly shows off<br/>
&gt;   &gt; an array of <br/>
&gt;   &gt; bottles, vials and flasks with home-brewed potions,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; elixirs and <br/>
&gt;   &gt; fragrant creams with which she treats her friends. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;At first my friends and family ridiculed me for<br/>
&gt;   &gt; wanting to become a <br/>
&gt;   &gt; witch. But now they come to me for one of my potions<br/>
&gt;   &gt; to soothe a <br/>
&gt;   &gt; cough or whatever,&quot; she said. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Like Katharina, aspiring witch Saltah embraced the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; craft three years <br/>
&gt;   &gt; ago due to a thirst for knowledge. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;It started off as curiosity about mushrooms and<br/>
&gt;   &gt; herbs, but then I <br/>
&gt;   &gt; realised that I simply wanted answers to so many<br/>
&gt;   &gt; things I couldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;   &gt; comprehend and that this school could provide me<br/>
&gt;   &gt; with them,&quot; said <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Saltah, who is in her mid-20s. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Both women said the course was challenging<br/>
&gt;   &gt; intellectually as <br/>
&gt;   &gt; witchcraft covered a swath of subjects. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;Just learning and completing the syllabus doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   &gt; make you a witch. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; You&#39;ve got to work at it day in day out,&quot; Saltah<br/>
&gt;   &gt; said. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;It&#39;s going to take me another 20 years before I can<br/>
&gt;   &gt; truly call <br/>
&gt;   &gt; myself a witch,&quot; said Katharina, hunched over a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; toadstool. <br/>
