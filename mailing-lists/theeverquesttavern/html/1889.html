<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753954721">Well, I&#39;m breaking my own heart here, but my<br/>
friend who is cancelling her account gave me all of her<br/>
stuff . . . almost full lambent, singing steel boots,<br/>
eight different weapons and instruments(including a<br/>
yak, blade of firey lamentations, mistmoore drums,<br/>
lute of the gypsy princess, etc . . .), and her 300pp<br/>
left over. All I could say at the time was &quot;Damn!&quot; I<br/>
seriously have never had so much stuff before . . . and<br/>
now, I have to learn how to play a bard. (Never played<br/>
one past lvl 7.) I really can&#39;t solo that well,<br/>
unless I find her 51 shammie friend who buffs me up when<br/>
he&#39;s on. Then . . . well, then I&#39;m killing red mobs<br/>
for as long as talisman lasts. :) And I have never<br/>
had so many people ask to inspect me! Wow . . .<br/>
although I imagine a 5 bard running around in lambent with<br/>
MM drums kinda invites that. I will say that I love<br/>
having all the stuff, and I hope she doesn&#39;t unfreeze<br/>
her account any time soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for knowledge<br/>
being twinking, I never thought about that, but it&#39;s<br/>
definately true. I can start almost anywhere (especially<br/>
Qeynos or Kelethin/Felwithe) and know the best possible<br/>
way to level. But I always help my newer friends out<br/>
with info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Kanissa, 35 druid, Rodcet<br/>
