<div id="ygrps-yiv-142310688">Understandably. It&#39;s actually dependant on your<br/>
philosophy and ethics. There&#39;s always portions of one&#39;s<br/>
philosophy that&#39;s hard to adhere to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve had times<br/>
when I was tempted not to turn in that wallet, or gold<br/>
chain, take the easy way out, or stop caring at my<br/>
job...etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far, so good. Course, everyone&#39;s ideas of ethics<br/>
is different and I&#39;ve been called a sap more than<br/>
once. =) Gluck with holding to yours. Cause every<br/>
little thing is another little thing and little things<br/>
add up. =) And I admire ethics a lot-- even when I<br/>
can&#39;t agree with the ethics. heh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
