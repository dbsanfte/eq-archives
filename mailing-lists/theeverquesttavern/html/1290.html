<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979444441">The smugglers will attack you when you hit<br/>
Dyllin, if any smugs are near him, just use the failsafe<br/>
harmony on em. Note: there are some wandering smugs that<br/>
were red to me at 24, watch out for them, and if you<br/>
get in a spot you don&#39;t like, run up the hill to the<br/>
left of where Dyllin spawns, it exits directly in<br/>
front of some guards at high keep. Dyllin is not a<br/>
spellcaster and hits for less than 20 per hit, easily.</div>
