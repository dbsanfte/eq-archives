<div id="ygrps-yiv-99424901">I _think_ so - that&#39;s what I heard on Everlore or something. But not <br/>
while I was in the zone.  There, I just heard references to a named <br/>
Snow Orc or something.  <br/>
<br/>
Heck, I was a first-level shaman and kind of distracted in RL at the <br/>
time, so I wasn&#39;t really paying attention.  But what I saw was fun -- <br/>
Ice Giants and Iceboned Skels in the tunnel to Halas.<br/>
