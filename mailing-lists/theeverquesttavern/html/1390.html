<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068041786">Dear Noob (friendly term not derogatory) big<br/>
words for trollie heheh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway: spirit pouch can<br/>
be summoned by a shaman like me...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;good news:<br/>
things in it don&#39;t weigh as much as when they are in say<br/>
a backpack&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;bad news: which I am sure you<br/>
know by now, is that if you go linkdead, your computer<br/>
crashes or you camp and log out, everything in the spirit<br/>
pouch including the pouch is gone for good, just like<br/>
summoned food or water...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take care brush your<br/>
hair&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grumph, trollie shammie&lt;br&gt;21st lvl &lt;br&gt;Vazaelle<br/>
server&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I usually donate summoned stuff too if I&#39;m gonna<br/>
log and it&#39;ll be lost anyway...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;have fun and<br/>
barsh a few on the head hehe</div>
