<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635894204">I am getting tired of some of the groups i ve<br/>
been in recently. i guess it wasnt so bad before<br/>
because i could solo well and there arent that many<br/>
creatures u hunt in groups that take a lot of<br/>
thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well now i have started grouping and it seems in<br/>
finding more people who were either power leveled or<br/>
leveled by quests(i.e. DF belts in FP and Bone Chips in<br/>
Kaladim). Yes this is a great thought for getting through<br/>
the earlier lvls but.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reasons why this is<br/>
bad:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1: If it is ur first char. then you really dont<br/>
learn how to play him. Youn need to learn how to<br/>
survive and learn your limits of what you can and cant<br/>
do.(also if its you ve never played the class before id<br/>
also recomend playing Vs pwr lvling)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2: I was<br/>
grouped with a guy at the treants, i pull and go in and<br/>
all i see is fizzle, fizzle, fizzle, fizzle.......<br/>
50%of his mana burned in fizzles before he got the<br/>
spell off and put alot more of a burden on me. The<br/>
players ive seen so far that have lvld this way, you can<br/>
tell. They suck at thier skills(unless theve taken out<br/>
ALOT of time just to work on them)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess all<br/>
im saying is at later lvls you dont want to put<br/>
other players at risk cause of lack of experience. Yes<br/>
sure everyone hates being a newbie and wants to get<br/>
out of that stage ASAP but it is there for a reason:<br/>
to help you learn your char. and how to play<br/>
them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am only level 25 but i got thier by my self and i<br/>
feel that is an accomplishment. I am just trying to<br/>
inform people of the consiquences of the &quot;easy way.&quot; I<br/>
hope that as i reach the later levels that i will see<br/>
this less and less. I m trying to bitch but their will<br/>
probaly be a lot of u who read this that will take it<br/>
like that but oh well. Email me with<br/>
comments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cireno De&#39;Tenebrae&lt;br&gt;House<br/>

time when u get to where u want to be to make sure ur<br/>
skills are up to par. If not for ur sake then for the<br/>
sake of others)</div>
