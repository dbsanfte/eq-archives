<b>Subject:</b> DING!!  Welcome to Level 16 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-185168294">Hey all - I play on Xev server (anyone else??)<br/>
and am new to these yahoo clubs. I&#39;d love to meet up<br/>
with anyone who plays on Xev for some fun. I have 2<br/>
chars - Xela is a lvl 16 wood elf druid, and Serrafina<br/>
is a lvl 16 gnome mage. Serra is a member of the<br/>
Defenders of Mithril Hall, but Xela has not found a home<br/>
yet, and is looking for a guild to match his love of<br/>
nature and worship of Mother Tunare. Please let me know<br/>
if you have info on the Xev guilds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m also<br/>
looking for some good druid gear (there HAS to be<br/>
something better than leather for my level), so please let<br/>
me know what you think I should be searching for, if<br/>
you&#39;ve been here before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, i&#39;ve done a lot<br/>
of research lately on tinkering and spell research<br/>
for my gnome. Let me know if you have questions, or<br/>
advice - as i&#39;m ready to jump in!! (actually, i think<br/>
i&#39;ll wait till lvl 19 to start w/ research).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go with Tunare!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela (soon to be Xela<br/>
Orcbane)of Xev&lt;br&gt;16th season wood elf<br/>
druid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serrafina of Xev&lt;br&gt;16th season gnome mage</div>
