<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-475991822">I&#39;ve noticed some of the msgs for that guide<br/>
don&#39;t mix for me either. However, I thought it was just<br/>
my bad memory hitting. I thought I&#39;ve seen blue cons<br/>
that said &quot;quite formidable&quot;. They&#39;ve probably changed<br/>
a few things that guides haven&#39;t updated. But for<br/>
the most part--- that con guide&#39;s pretty good. I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen it anywhere online though. Where does it<br/>
come from?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, hide/sneak is supposed to work<br/>
like camo/invis. And as far as I can tell-- animals<br/>
can see through the hide/sneak/camo/invis sometimes<br/>
for some reason. It&#39;s almost as if they aren&#39;t as<br/>
affected b/c of smell. I haven&#39;t noticed the affect as my<br/>
level and skill in div went up though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep in<br/>
mind that I only count Bears, and Lions in this mix.<br/>
Griffs and other mytical animals I don&#39;t really count.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and yes. Con really helps. And as always, I<br/>
recommend-- go out to places that you like to kill, find a<br/>
group. If possible, get the group to lead ya to the next<br/>
best spot to group and kill. Then you will find the<br/>
next spot to go to find groups -- which will then get<br/>
you more groups to lead to new spots.<br/>

I love&lt;br&gt;29th. I may have spent 175 plat and not<br/>
even come close to getting all my spells of the<br/>
29th... but oooooh. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... yep. I&#39;m crazy about<br/>
groups. I&#39;ll advertise them whenever possible.</div>
