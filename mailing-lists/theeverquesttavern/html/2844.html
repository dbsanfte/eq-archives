<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542068940">Ever since that last patch, I&#39;ve been having seriously bad lag <br/>
happening, where as before I had no lag, except for in the Bazaar. <br/>
Now it doesn&#39;t matter where I&#39;m at, it lags. This is unusual seeing <br/>
as how I&#39;ve been playing since July with no lag.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone having or had this problem?</div>
