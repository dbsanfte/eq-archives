<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056093393">Here is just my personal opinion on why nobody<br/>
should be complaining about how &quot;their class is<br/>
weak&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People choose classes based on what they THINK the class<br/>
will be like. Sometimes their perception of what a<br/>
&quot;Wizard&quot; or &quot;Monk&quot; is varies quite a bit from what Verant<br/>
thinks. Then at some point these people realize that<br/>
their class does not live up to what they thought it<br/>
should be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, at this point, most people will<br/>
switch classes. Some people &quot;stick it out&quot; in the hopes<br/>
that their class will somehow get better at higher<br/>
levels or that Verant will change the class to meet that<br/>
player&#39;s expectations. I have no remorse for those people.<br/>
Playing a character you do not like is foolish. The<br/>
instant you figured out you didn&#39;t like your character<br/>
you should have switched. I played a Cleric to 14 and<br/>
a Monk to 12 before finding my favorite class<br/>
(Enchanter). Did I think the Cleric or Monk classes were weak?<br/>
Hell no. I just wasn&#39;t having the playing experience<br/>
that I thought I would, and came to the conclusion to<br/>
switch characters. I had fun up until the end with those<br/>
characters, so most of my time with them wasn&#39;t really<br/>
wasted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most common post I see on the various forums goes<br/>
something like this: (very simplified)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Verant said<br/>
[class] are the masters of [whatever] and they aren&#39;t!<br/>
[Other class] is way better at at it than we are! I&#39;m<br/>
level [insert high level] so I know what I&#39;m talking<br/>
about!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My question is this: Did you finally come to this<br/>
brilliant conclusion only AFTER reaching level 50???? It<br/>
took you 50 levels to realize you think your class<br/>
&quot;sucks&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, I&#39;m being excessive with the level 50 example,<br/>
but I hope you get my point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another<br/>
possibility:&lt;br&gt;So you started playing a Rogue let&#39;s say. You get to<br/>
a certain point and it becomes clear that being a<br/>
Rogue is not what you had in mind....but there are no<br/>
other classes that appeal to you out there. Then I<br/>
think you are stuck. Your only options are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)<br/>
Change your perceptions of Rogues (unlikely)&lt;br&gt;2) Learn<br/>
to live with the differences in your vision versus<br/>
Verant&#39;s vision.&lt;br&gt;3) Play another game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of<br/>
these people try #2 and can never fully accept the<br/>
differences in vision. They eventually get pissed and either<br/>
quit or start filling the boards with their heated<br/>
posts to vent their rage. I feel sorry for these<br/>
people, and I hope they eventually find whatever it is<br/>
they are looking for in a game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last<br/>
possible scenario I can think of is nerfs. If you started<br/>
a Necro and enjoyed it all the way to 50 then some<br/>
new patch came along with what you think is a<br/>
horrible detriment to your class...well that sucks. I can<br/>
feel your pain. My only suggestion then would be to<br/>
post some intelligent requests on why the change<br/>
should be revoked or some possible reparations that<br/>
could be made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope this is read by people<br/>
with an open mind. If even one person out there gains<br/>
any insight from this post then I feel it was worth<br/>
the potential flames.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good journey to you<br/>
all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>
