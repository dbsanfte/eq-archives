<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977728853">Uh... yeah, what JS and Boggs said too. (I just<br/>
saw your posts, guys-- good advice). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.--<br/>
Remember to imagine your audience in thier underwear,<br/>
(until your audience is over 18, then you can imagine<br/>
them naked). This never works for me, though, as I get<br/>
too distracted to go forward with the<br/>
presentation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.P.S.-- If you prepared written materials, please post<br/>
them on this board. If you do it early enough, i&#39;m<br/>
sure you&#39;ll get some helpful (hopefully)<br/>
reviews/suggestions and tons of support, that will help you with<br/>
editing the work. (Life is much like EQ-- if you&#39;re first<br/>
effort is not your best, don&#39;t give up. That first<br/>
careless lighting only did 34dmg? Hmmm... Hit the mob<br/>
again, or maybe take a different approach with a DOT and<br/>
some melee). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
