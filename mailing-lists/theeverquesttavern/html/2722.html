That would be Kelethin.  Yes, they&#39;ll skin you alive even more <br/>
quickly than the Wood Elves.  So will the Dwarves of Kaladim, if <br/>
that&#39;s the place you&#39;re thinking of (but the entrance to Kaladim is <br/>
in the next zone over, Butcherblock Mountains).<br/>
<br/>
My advice is just to be a Dark Elf SK and kill everything in sight, <br/>
except your own people and maybe Ogre and Trolls.  Relish your evil, <br/>
revel in it.  You can always create an alt someday and go exploring <br/>
the good zones you&#39;ve never gotten to see.<br/>
