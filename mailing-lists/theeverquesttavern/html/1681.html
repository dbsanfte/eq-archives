<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652231679">If you&#39;re talking CD Codes (on your everquest CD)<br/>
NO. You HAVE to buy another game to open another<br/>
account. You don&#39;t, however, have to buy another game if<br/>
you want one account on two computers. Say one on<br/>
your summer home&#39;s computer and one on your winter<br/>
home&#39;s. (Wishful thinking, right?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re<br/>
talking Credit Cards, then YES, you can use one Credit<br/>
Card to open two (or more) accounts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does that<br/>
help?</div>
