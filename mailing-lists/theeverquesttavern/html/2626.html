 </span></blockquote>Were you running any programs when you did this?  62% system resources is a<br/>
bit low.  One thing I would suggest is to close as many of the programs in<br/>
your system tray (the area next to the clock with all of those icons) as you<br/>
can.  You can gain a little bit of processing power back on your PC if you<br/>
close those programs.<br/>
