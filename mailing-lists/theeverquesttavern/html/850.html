<div id="ygrps-yiv-543536215">Toreis examines the room from Outside, obeying<br/>
the wishes of the gods of this realm and not stepping<br/>
inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A smile graces her not quite corporal form as she<br/>
examines the many worthy people who quest about their<br/>
lives below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;If only they knew&#39; she thinks to<br/>
herself -- &#39;Their world is important, but is only an echo<br/>
of the Wyrld, and the next age approaches. Once<br/>
again Darkness will rise.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She reaches out her<br/>
hand and swipes it across the globe, causing all who<br/>
are atuned, all who are heroes and heroines, to feel<br/>
her touch, and to know of the other Wyrld, the Wyrld<br/>
that needs<br/>
them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Wyrldscape&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=http://wyrldscape.com target=new&gt;http://wyrldscape.com&lt;/a&gt;</div>
