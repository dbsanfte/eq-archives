<b>Subject:</b> Re: New Guild Forming in Tribunal <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051313605">I happened to be browsing while downloading the current patch and was <br/>
excited to find this board.  The idea for this guild greatly intrests <br/>
me, and in anticipation I have taken the liberty of creating a mage <br/>
on the tribunal server.  I hope to be a part of the guild.  If you <br/>
would like to contact me please send e-mail to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nitecollector@...">nitecollector@...</a>.</div>
