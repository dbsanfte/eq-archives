<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673954437">Yep... Stun and bash and taunt. Gooooo<br/>
Paly!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things turn too rough... LOH. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... thinking about stuns.. one of the most<br/>
interesting groups I&#39;ve ever been in and worked really well<br/>
in OT was &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3 Druids, 1 shaman, 1 wizard, 1<br/>
Chanter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Druids used wolf form to pull. Then we&#39;d sit up around<br/>
the mob... pull it around until it lost agro b/c the<br/>
other&#39;s were nuking and stunning it to all get<br/>
out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With three druids to snare and all three of us were<br/>
using stun. Plus the chanter was using his ultra low<br/>
mana stun (bad thing was it put him in melee range<br/>
BUT)...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it was constantly stunned... agro was almost<br/>
exclusively to Druids in wolf form so we pullers didn&#39;t even<br/>
use much mana and had Clarity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the<br/>
wizard was stunning too. And it was slowed and snared.<br/>
Poor monsters. Do you go after the madly nuking<br/>
wizzie? Or the shaman with uber spell damage? Or the<br/>
snaring, nuking, dotting, stunning, healing<br/>
druids?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS.. you know? My post script was longer than my post.</div>
