<div id="ygrps-yiv-901622855">Planes of Power is a very valuable asset for a<br/>
starting character.  I never had it and will be<br/>
starting EQ again in the next few months, but Before<br/>
PoP came out you had to pay massive amounts of<br/>
platinum to get teleported anywhere.  With a lot of<br/>
the newbie quest armor you also have to get rare<br/>
pieces which will be easier to handle if you can get<br/>
to cities across the map without having to cross<br/>
through the lvl 30+ areas to get there.  When I was a<br/>
newbie I tried to cross the continent and got stuck in<br/>
the Arena at lvl 9 and was bound (don&#39;t ask) there and<br/>
couldn&#39;t get out...  It was pure luck after 6 hours<br/>
someone walked into the lake area..  Well Good Luck,<br/>
but if your still not sure just stick with the<br/>
original til you get your levels up.<br/>
