<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244085669">I decided that it was time to start a guild for<br/>
all those that wanted to be part of one but never<br/>
really had a chance. Well here it is. I would like you<br/>
to think of this as your on-line virtual family.<br/>
It&#39;s open to all, and we only have some rules, but<br/>
that is necessary in order to keep some type of order.<br/>
I wanted to create a better on-line experiance,<br/>
where we all help each other in the ultimate goal,<br/>
being the liberators of Norrath. Come and Check out our<br/>
page at<br/>
