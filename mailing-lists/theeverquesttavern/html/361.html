<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168909337">It was an event where the GMs took all the NPC&#39;s<br/>
out of Qeynos Hills and replaced them with Undead.<br/>
And all kinds of undead at that. Even Undead,<br/>
characters that are usually imposible to find. It was not a<br/>
good place for a newbie character to be since all the<br/>
undead were powerfull enough to kill you in one or two<br/>
hits.</div>
