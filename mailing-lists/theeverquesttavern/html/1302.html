<div id="ygrps-yiv-554712202">Here&#39;s another Qeynos/Halas area quest dealing<br/>
with gnolls. I&#39;m not sure it works, but it&#39;s been<br/>
bouncing around Everlore a little bit lately. &lt;br&gt;We all<br/>
know the &quot;patches of gnoll fur&quot; that we get from<br/>
killing gnolls (from pups to elites), right? Well... find<br/>
yourself a large sewing kit, put 4 of em, (not stacked, as<br/>
with any trade skill) and hit combine. If what I&#39;ve<br/>
heard works, you should get some sort of shoulder armor<br/>
(has some save v. cold on it, I think). Take this to<br/>
someone in the Halas rogue guild, and you can exchange it<br/>
for xp, faction with barbs, and a barbarian rogue<br/>
weapon, which I think could be sold for a little bit. I&#39;m<br/>
not especially sure on any of this, but gnoll patches<br/>
are incredibly easy to come across in blackburrow. I<br/>
will investigate this quest a bit and report back<br/>
soon. I hope it works, because I could use some good<br/>
faction with those crazy barbarians.. heh...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai<br/>
