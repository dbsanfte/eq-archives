<div id="ygrps-yiv-267107909">Try being a Rogue. The only time I can&#39;t get the<br/>
MoB off of me after I backstab a few times is when<br/>
it&#39;s on a caster (usually the healer). Yes, the MoB is<br/>
going to kill you before it turns around to deal with<br/>
the others. And it sounds like you had some good<br/>
casters if they took care of a werebat after you were<br/>
dead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the real key here is - the<br/>
/assist command! If you&#39;re the main tank, they should all<br/>
be assisting you. And if the other tank was the<br/>
main, he or she should have a much clearer idea of what<br/>
the main threat to the group is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel your<br/>
pain - I died three times in the last two days,<br/>
starting from ONE KILL&#39;&#39;s worth of exp to ding 23. And<br/>
this was in Unrest, too. Skeletal Monks hit hard . . .<br/>
And always remember to bind.</div>
