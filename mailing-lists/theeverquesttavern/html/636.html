<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043738023">Oh dear... there is always one isn&#39;t<br/>
there?&lt;br&gt;Have been reading the gameplay forums at everquest msg<br/>
boards?&lt;br&gt;Wizzies who say they suck simply don&#39;t get it. Now I<br/>
don&#39;t have a wiz hicgh enough in level bet let me tell<br/>
you this. Several classes are never ment to be solo<br/>
classes. Good examples are rouges, Clerics at higer levels<br/>
and wizzies. I grouped with a wiz that called himself<br/>
a Microwave. And I knew he was going to be crap.<br/>
And I was proving right, Wizzies do a lot more then<br/>
just nuke the holy crap out of a critter. The art of<br/>
playing a Wiz is to group and to group well...&lt;br&gt;Know<br/>
when to nuke and when not to. A lot of Wizzies say I<br/>
suck.. because I always die and tanks can&#39;t taunt things<br/>
of me in time. Well time those nukes. A tank can&#39;t<br/>
taunt something of you if you just nuked the crap out<br/>
of a critter for 200 points every turn while the<br/>
tank only deal 26 or so. A good wiz in a gri=oup rocks<br/>
and can save more lives by nuking on time then a<br/>
cleric with full mana can! If you think any class you<br/>
play sucks... it is just because you aren&#39;t playing it<br/>
the way you should.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explore the depths of your<br/>
character and know when to do what. Good luck and hope you<br/>
will still learn to like your Mircowave.... ;-)</div>
