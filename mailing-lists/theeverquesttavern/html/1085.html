<b>Subject:</b> $49.95 a month!! YEAH RIGHT! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-121441207">I love that little question they asked me when I<br/>
logged on last week. Would you be willing to pay<br/>
$49.95/month for &quot;Premium Customer Service&quot; and a &quot;population<br/>
Cap&quot; on your server?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What a F-ing joke! If<br/>
anyone pressed the yes button when asked this...they<br/>
need to get examined by a shrink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the<br/>
shitty ass customer service present at Verant today (I<br/>
know firsthand, it is terrible), how does Verant hope<br/>
to convince me that they even know what &quot;Premium<br/>
Customer Service&quot; means???!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To them &quot;Premium&quot; is<br/>
most likely what other &quot;Reputable&quot; companies would<br/>
consider &quot;Bare Minimum Service&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$49.95 a<br/>
month??!!! What a bunch of greedy ass bastards (excuse my<br/>
French). Let&#39;s look at some numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are<br/>
currently over 100,000 ACTIVE SUBSCRIBERS at Verant. This<br/>
number is VERY conservative, im sure the actual figure<br/>
is much higher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will work with 100,000 for<br/>
ease of use.&lt;br&gt;Each of these people pay an average of<br/>
$8.95/month to play everquest. That comes to $895,000 PER<br/>
MONTH...every single month!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That comes to $10,740,000<br/>
per YEAR!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the greedy asses want to kick<br/>
it to $49.95/month on a voluntary basis. Let us<br/>
again seek to predict the future and say that a mere<br/>
10% of active subscribers fall for this pathetic<br/>
ploy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That would mean 10,000 (conservatively) people would<br/>
agree to pay the $49.95/month which comes to $410,000<br/>
MORE COMING IN EACH MONTH. Note: I deducted the<br/>
$89,500 these 10,000 are already paying from the original<br/>
figure of $499,500.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This would mean Verant would<br/>
bring in an additional $4,920,000/ per year....for<br/>
doing absolutely NOTHING that they should not already<br/>
be doing!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rally together people.....Do not<br/>
EVER agree to do this, when it is offered in the<br/>
future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think about it, it makes NO sense. IF you agree with me<br/>
on this issue...can I get a HELL<br/>
YEAH?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MrHappy</div>
