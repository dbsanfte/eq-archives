<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225679548">The servers are only named after the gods there<br/>
not based on them. I play on bertox and all my chars<br/>
are not evil only the ones I wanted to be evil. Eq is<br/>
spose to be roleplaying but most people just play the<br/>
game and dont roleplay. Servers are not based on<br/>
countries most servers have a mixture of alot of different<br/>
people. When I started on eq I picked eq casue it was the<br/>
first one on my list and I mostly play on<br/>
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien</div>
