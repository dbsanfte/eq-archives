To:  The Salisbury Post, North Carolina <br/>
We, the undersigned, are outraged at the refusal of a request to list <br/>
a Pagan/Wiccan Study Group - Magickal Moon in the Salisbury Post, <br/>
which is located in Salisbury, North Carolina. The reason given for <br/>
the request by the FAITH Copy Editor was both ignorant and <br/>
discriminatory. &quot;The Salisbury Post FAITH section is for people who <br/>
believe in God&quot; and &quot;this is not the image that The Post wants to <br/>
portray.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The Salisbury Post&#39;s mission statement says in part: <br/>
&quot;We are a marketing and customer driven company whose mission is to <br/>
inform, educate and entertain. We strive to mirror the unique <br/>
communities we serve and offer responsible public forum.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We fail to see how denying a Pagan/Wiccan study group an equal space <br/>
with other congregations fulfills this mission statement. The <br/>
decision was made with personal prejudices and not handled with a <br/>
professional demeanor. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless of whether or not Paganism is The Salisbury Post&#39;s <br/>
religion, it is our religion. The Federal Government recognizes <br/>
Paganism/Wicca, as an official religion. Military Courts of Justice <br/>
in the U.S. have also found Wicca to be a valid religion, deserving <br/>
of protection under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In <br/>
the case United States v. Phillips, (42 M.J. 346) in 1995) the <br/>
concurring opinion by Judge Wiss stated: &quot;First, Wicca is a socially <br/>
recognized religion. It is acknowledged as such by the Army. <br/>
See `Dept. of the Army (DA) Pamphlet 165-13-1, Religious Requirements <br/>
and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains&#39; <br/>
(April 1980), revising A Pamphlet 165-13, `Religious Requirements and <br/>
Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains&#39; <br/>
(April 1978). Further, it is acknowledged as such in courts of law.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Pagans and Wiccans are a part of your community. We are your <br/>
neighbors, your coworkers, your children&#39;s teachers; we are <br/>
professionals, but most importantly we are your readers - your <br/>
customers! As engraved on your building and imprinted on the <br/>
Opinion/Editorial page of the paper &quot;The truth shall make you free&quot;; <br/>
misconceptions about pagans, and being denied access to public forum <br/>
makes it all the more difficult for the truth to make any of us free. <br/>
<br/>
Due to the fact that this request was handled in an unprofessional <br/>
manner and with personal bigotry, we, the undersigned, as well as <br/>
members of our family and friends, who are both of the Christian and <br/>
Pagan faith will not support The Salisbury Post. We will no longer be <br/>
a part of your readership until this matter is reconciled with a <br/>
formal apology and the list is made public in The Salisbury Post. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are not evil. We don&#39;t harm or seduce people. We are not <br/>
dangerous. We are ordinary people like you. We have families, jobs, <br/>
hopes, and dreams. We are not a cult. This religion is not a joke. We <br/>
are not what you think we are from looking at T.V. We are real. We <br/>
laugh, we cry. We are serious. We have a sense of humor. You don&#39;t <br/>
have to be afraid of us. We don&#39;t want to convert you. And please <br/>
don&#39;t try to convert us. Just give us the same right we give you--to <br/>
live in peace. We are much more similar to you than you think.&quot; - <br/>
Margot Adler <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
The Undersigned <br/>
