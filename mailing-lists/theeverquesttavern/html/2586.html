Veeshan is about as big as Norrath itself, and there is no way they <br/>
can implement a dragon of that size in the game, unless it&#39;s some <br/>
other mob with the Veeshan name tagged on it, like Innoruuk&#39;s Agent. <br/>
Besides, the dragon will always remain up in the Plane of the Sky, <br/>
although unreachable by any player.</div>
