<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219114036">Hello fellow evercrack addicts I play a 30th lvl<br/>
bard on TZ by the name of Brohman Barrhopper. I play<br/>
at odd hours of the day becase I am shift worker in<br/>
the army here in md. I have played on a variety of<br/>
servers since last april and I just was wondering what<br/>
the consesnus is here, do those of you on blue<br/>
servers all consider us murderers and plunderers like<br/>
verant does? And if you play on TZ gimme a tell(I also<br/>
play a SK named darkenn)I would love to chat. Take<br/>
care and feed your addiction....it is good for you.</div>
