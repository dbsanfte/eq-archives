<div id="ygrps-yiv-114282778">LOL. I just loaded in my new mem chip so now I have 230MB. Cool huh? <br/>
The only problem is I also bought a new vid card (This one is AGP) <br/>
and I can&#39;t seem to get it to work. *sigh* I might have to wait until <br/>
I move on campus next week and a friend can take a crack at it. <br/>
Anyway. Since all of this is happening I am hopefully going to be <br/>
able to log in as soon as I get a phone line, maybe by this next <br/>
weekend? I would like to thank everyone here for the help ya&#39;ll have <br/>
given me so I could get back into the game. And I&#39;d like to thank in <br/>
advance for any other questions that I WILL have. LOL The Raven</div>
