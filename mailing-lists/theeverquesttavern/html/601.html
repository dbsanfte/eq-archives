<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264848008">&quot;NO DROP&quot; means that you cannot get rid of that<br/>
item by giving/exchanging it with someone else, either<br/>
a player character or a nonplayer character. You<br/>
also cannot drop the item; i.e. click on the item,<br/>
then click on the area of the screen that shows the EQ<br/>
world. If the item is a dagger, then a dagger should<br/>
appear on the ground near where you were standing when<br/>
you dropped it. No drop is used to avoid twinking,<br/>
when a higher level character gives his items to a low<br/>
level character of his. If a magician loots a powerful<br/>
warrior-only sword, he may create a warrior so he can use the<br/>
sword. But if it&#39;s no drop, all the magician can do is<br/>
hold on to the sword, put it in a bank, or destroy<br/>
it.&lt;br&gt;&quot;LORE ITEM&quot; means that your character will only get one<br/>
copy of that particular item in his EQ lifetime. Take<br/>
for example the Bloodfire, an extremely powerful<br/>
warrior-only sword. It&#39;s 1 handed, so a warrior could use 2 of<br/>
these with dual wield and become very powerful. But if<br/>
the sword is lore, then the warrior can have but one<br/>
of these. Does this help? Sorry so<br/>
long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Half-elf warrior of 12 seasons&lt;br&gt;Prexus</div>
