<div id="ygrps-yiv-346850199">Hiya..very good directions indeed..looks like I<br/>
am not the only one that goes to Highpass along the<br/>
shore..as it is safer. The bandit camp you mention is right<br/>
at the first house or barn that you come to after<br/>
passing the stonebridge..just move up and away from the<br/>
shore..till you pass the barn. If you look down you can see<br/>
the bandits down below.</div>
