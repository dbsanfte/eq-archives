<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041433435">The only real way to level up is to fight in the<br/>
&quot;newbie&quot; zone. This is the area just outside of Felwithe.<br/>
Includes mostly bats and wasps. Just stay close to the<br/>
city and run to the guards if you get in trouble. They<br/>
will usually kill whats chasing you.&lt;br&gt;When u get to<br/>
around level 5 or so you can start asking others your<br/>
level to group up with you.</div>
