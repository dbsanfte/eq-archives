a surname yet (pre-20 or by choice). However, you will if changes <br/>
need to be made.<br/>

After that it&#39;s entirely up to the player how their wedding unfolds. <br/>
I did mine eons ago when I was around level 13 I believe. It was a <br/>
personal wedding, bride, myself, closest friends and a GM (who was <br/>
also a good friend) at Qeynos (we were fighting around their for XP <br/>
at the time). Two years later we renewed our vows at a neutral zone, <br/>
Lake Rathe with the entire guild and drunk members proceeded to <br/>
destroy each other at the Arena afterwards for sh**s and giggles :)</div>
