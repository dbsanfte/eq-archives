<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465899699">So you blame a single tank? Where was the chanter<br/>
to mez the mobs? Or the other tank. Usually in my<br/>
full groups it tends to be the following: Warrior,<br/>
Ranger (or another warrior), Rogue or Paladin (possibly<br/>
a monk), Cleric, Enchanter, and a Druid (me!). It<br/>
is the chanter&#39;s job to control extra mobs via<br/>
Mez... if the chanter is being attacked, then it falls<br/>
to the ranger to taunt it off the chanter (works<br/>
well due to a high damage output by the ranger along<br/>
with taunt). This strategy tends to work quite well,<br/>
and has turned many uncontrollable (normally) trains<br/>
into a good bit of fun and experience. And the reason<br/>
for the druid? Heals for the cleric/chanter/rogue and<br/>
of course Wolf form for<br/>
everyone!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Awooooooo!!!!!&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Wolfing people since level 39!</div>
