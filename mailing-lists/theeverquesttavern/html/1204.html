<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008240885">Personally, I prefer the auto-split on, and one<br/>
person gets all the loot. When finished, go to town, and<br/>
whoever has best faction sells the loot, and everything<br/>
gets split evenly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other way we split loot<br/>
is by turns... after a kill everyone takes turns<br/>
looting. If someone gets something you want, you buy it<br/>
from them. Often, in my regular group, if you ask for<br/>
something they will simply give it to you. It&#39;s a good idea<br/>
to offer to pay for it anyway. Polite, ya&#39; know?</div>
