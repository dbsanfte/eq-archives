<div id="ygrps-yiv-172165312">anyone in here on veeshan? thats where i am.&lt;br&gt;i<br/>
have a lev 16 wizard named Talrasha and i just started<br/>
my second character named Vahleck. he is a rogue<br/>
woodelf. &lt;br&gt;I am kind of disappointed. i thought playing<br/>
a wizard would always be cool, but lately i just<br/>
don&#39;t like him anymore. i can barely kill things blue<br/>
to me and i spend hours looking for a group when i<br/>
log on. hopefully the rogue will be better.</div>
