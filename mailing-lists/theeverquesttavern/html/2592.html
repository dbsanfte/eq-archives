<b>Subject:</b> Re: Question about Plat Guides and Derv Rings <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209791296">For the most part, Plat guides and PL guides are not worth it unless <br/>
you are really new to the game and can&#39;t find web sites (most of <br/>
which, like Allakhazam&#39;s has all this info, you just have to find <br/>
it).  <br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine got one, thinking it would give him all these <br/>
secrets, but it didn&#39;t. In fact, some of the info. was outdated and <br/>
just plain wrong.  Best bet is to check out EQAtlas or Allakhazam&#39;s-- <br/>
check out the zones you&#39;re in or near, look up the quests and check <br/>
out the comments made about them-- sometimes you might have to post a <br/>
request for info-- ie, Is this a good xp quest? For what levels?. <br/>
Other than that, come to places like this, and just test out quests <br/>
in the game. It doesn&#39;t take much time to &quot;hail&quot; NPCs in cities.  <br/>
<br/>
Now the good stuff-- DF quests (both of them) are great quests, and <br/>
they give different faction depending on what type you want. I hear <br/>
tht the one in NFP (pally guild?) is better xp, but the one in the <br/>
with the Captain of the guard is really good, with decent coin for <br/>
under lvl 15.  This is a similar quest to the Crushbone belt/pad <br/>
quest that comes from Kaladim. Great quest all the way to about lvl <br/>
14 as far as loot, faction and xp. And later you can /auction belts <br/>
and pads for some good plat.  <br/>
<br/>
Best bet for xp these days is to hit any dungeon with an xp bonus <br/>
(see Eqatlas, but most dungeons now have some kind of bonus). If you <br/>
are a solo class, go for it, but note that dungeons are indoors, so <br/>
druids are limited. Either bring some friends or look for a pickup <br/>
group. <br/>
<br/>
My rogue is now nearly lvl 30 after a month of off and on playing. <br/>
Started in BB mountains, went to CB and did the belt/pad quests to <br/>
early teens. Went to EC/WC to do orc and derv camps. Went to Oasis to <br/>
do orcs to high teens. Then went to High Pass to do orcs to 20. Then <br/>
to LOIO to do Sarnaks to 24, then to SK/Paw (xp bonus) to 28, then to <br/>
SOLA (xp bonus) to 30, and now in OT and Dalnir (xp bonus). I&#39;m not a <br/>
solo class, so I looked for good grouping places (LOIO and Oasis) to <br/>
get my skills up.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW-- DERV RING QUEST-- in WC you will have to turn in 4 orc pawn <br/>
picks to one of the toll booth guards- make sure to have good faction <br/>
with him (ie turn in DF belts to his captain in WFP). He will then <br/>
give you the ring quest-- He gives a backpack to fill with 8 rings <br/>
and combine. Give it back to him and he gives you a coin. Take it to <br/>
the FP guard house and find a smith there (can&#39;t remember his name), <br/>
turn it in and get a Freeport Militia Tunic (9ac and +3dex i think). <br/>
You&#39;ll get tons of FP faction for this and some xp too. The tunic is <br/>
not great, but I was running TONS of people through this quest on FV <br/>
when it first opened up-- a GREAT BP on that server.</div>
