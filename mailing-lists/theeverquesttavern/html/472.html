<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416333095">Met up with my first war lord which was enough to<br/>
make me reconsider my sanity in not grouping... i had<br/>
help but still would of been nice to have someone heal<br/>
me up...waiting is such a bore. I found that it&#39;s<br/>
also foolish to log off for a few minutes when you run<br/>
the risk of not getting back in. I still have&#39;nt<br/>
found a quest yet but have&#39;nt really been looking hard<br/>
...do they pay well?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Beechwoodgrey Lany&#39;s<br/>
