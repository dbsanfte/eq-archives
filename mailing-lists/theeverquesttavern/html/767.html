<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456294403">my money is on the SK though... I think both can<br/>
win depending on tactics used. The pet as an extra<br/>
attack is indeed very nice but what about the combo<br/>
engulfing dakness/fear?! Also HT will not be resisted. HT<br/>
only resists against a red con and even then you might<br/>
get it to stick (they changed it to this several<br/>
patches ago) Like I said both can win, but what I&#39;ve<br/>
heard of duels all around me... SK will win 60 to 70%<br/>
of the time... (Go dark ones go!)</div>
