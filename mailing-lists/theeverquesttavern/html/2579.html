<div id="ygrps-yiv-675791370">I know I asked this a while ago and it sparked a big conversation, <br/>
but I am higher lvl now and I don&#39;t know where to go.  I am almost <br/>
lvl 18 and I am still in TR (Throne Room in CB).  I am not getting <br/>
good experience except from crush who still cons yellow.  Where <br/>
should I hunt.  I only have the original and it gets me angry when <br/>
everyone tells me to go to the Lake of ILL Omen in Kunark.  Where can <br/>
I go that is still in the old world?<br/>
