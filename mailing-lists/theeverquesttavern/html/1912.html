<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098179589">Hmm... as far as druids go... My first character<br/>
ever was a druid, a half-elven one at that. I didn&#39;t<br/>
know what I was doing and I believe his base wisdom is<br/>
93 or so... abysmal for a druid. &lt;shrugs&gt; But<br/>
I liked the guy gosh darn it. He is the only druid<br/>
I have ever made though. There&#39;s enough druids in<br/>
this world, I think. We get stuck with some of the<br/>
worst stigma in the realm of Norrath. One druid&#39;s bad<br/>
actions reflect in the eyes of warriors and other classes<br/>
upon a hundred other druids. (actually, I do have<br/>
another druid, by the same name on a server which split<br/>
off from Karana, just so I could still chat<br/>
occassionally with friends. I think he got level 2 and has been<br/>
that way.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as Iksar go, it is possible<br/>
to not be as hated as some would have you think. I<br/>
have seen Iksar monks in Qeynos and Iksar<br/>
shadowknights in North Qeynos and Kelethin. It&#39;s all about<br/>
faction. Iksar make one of the best necromancer races in<br/>
the game, at level 10 my necro Kroq can regenerate<br/>
mana twice as fast as any other caster his age (save<br/>
for other Iksarian necros) and still gain HP (due to<br/>
the accelerated regeneration). Makes for easy<br/>
soloing, and even better grouping. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Remember-<br/>
Everquest is a group oriented game. At some point in your<br/>
Norrathian life, you will be in a group. Start young, when<br/>
mistakes do not matter quite as much. There are far too<br/>
many 40th level folks running around, grouping for the<br/>
first time, leads to terrible terrible instances.<br/>
Ick...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Note: It is a game. Never act like it is life, I&#39;ve<br/>
seen too many people get pissed that they missed their<br/>
spawn or lost an item and then just up and quit the<br/>
game. It is there for you to have fun with it, if you<br/>
aren&#39;t having fun, then you aren&#39;t doing it<br/>
right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to Norrath, and may the gods smile upon you,<br/>
whichever god you happen to follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai<br/>
