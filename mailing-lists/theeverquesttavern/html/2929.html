  &gt; i went to about 33 on my druid in highkeep too<br/>
  &gt; i suggest you try the overthere and the fronteer mountians in kunark<br/>
  &gt; you will have to take the big ship(the maidens voyage) from butcher <br/>
  block to faronia vie then run to the lake of ill omen and then to <br/>
  fronteer mountians then to the overthere<br/>
  &gt; or get a druid or wiz port to the dreadlands and run from there<br/>
  &gt; (the dreadlands is like a 45 to 50+ zone though so do be careful)<br/>
  &gt; you will need to review maps of course<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; if however you are of an evil race<br/>
  &gt; you can take the bloated belly barge from the oasis of mar to an <br/>
  island and then walk accross some rocks to a ogre outpost and take a <br/>
  broken ship to the overthere outpost<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; if you evil do go to faronia vie<br/>
  &gt; if you are good do not go to the overthere outpost<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; or<br/>
  &gt; if you like luclin you can still get some exp in marus  seru<br/>
  &gt; and you can get groups dawnshroud pieks<br/>
  &gt; a quick run from the nexus through neitherbain lare to ether one<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; for many races though the wolves are a problem in dawnshroud<br/>
  &gt; my wood elf druid seem to be amiable to most wolves but most other <br/>
  races are kos to them<br/>
  &gt; (i think they dont mind vah shir much ether)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; im almost done with my epic (excited)<br/>
  &gt; we go for the dragon this saturday<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; i think i have never talked on here much<br/>
  &gt; but i do read it<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; gratz on 34<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   Hello all. It&#39;s been a bit of time since I last posted. Sorry for <br/>
  &gt;   that. Between school and works (yes that&#39;s three jobs in that <br/>
  works) <br/>
  &gt;   I have been a very busy person. But I have managed to squeeze in <br/>
  &gt;   some precious EQ time, so I am happy. Now my question is this. I <br/>
  am <br/>
  &gt;   presently lvl 32. I am a tick and a half away from 33 so in my <br/>
  mind <br/>
  &gt;   that&#39;s close enough to 34 for me. (LOL Math was never my best <br/>
  &gt;   subject as you can tell.) Anyway. I am currently in High Keep <br/>
  &gt;   getting my lvl&#39;s and as soon as I get 34 I am so out of there. <br/>
  The <br/>
  &gt;   only problem is...where? I have considered Sol A, but I don&#39;t <br/>
  know <br/>
  &gt;   if I want to go there if it is crowded or if it is empty. (What <br/>
  with <br/>
  &gt;   all the expansions and all.) So where to go at lvl 34 for an <br/>
  &gt;   Enchanter? Any suggestions?<br/>
