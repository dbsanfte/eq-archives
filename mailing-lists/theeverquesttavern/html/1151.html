<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589547951">Yes, eventually, weapons are better for monks. At<br/>
level 60, a Human monk&#39;s fists are rated at<br/>
14dmg/26dly, while an Iksar monk&#39;s fists are rated at<br/>
14dmg/28dly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some very nice weapons for monks in Kunark -<br/>
Jade Mace (1hb, 9/18), Runed Fighter&#39;s Staff (2hb,<br/>
19/20), and Tranquil Staff (2hb, 29/30, procs<br/>
irresistable stun), to name a few.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must warn you that<br/>
these weapons are extremely rare and valuable. I would<br/>
venture to say that you will not receive either of these<br/>
before level 45, and even then, many post-50 monks do<br/>
not have any of the aforementioned<br/>
weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may want to get some cheap 1hb and 2hb weapons to<br/>
train your skills. Fight extremely low blues - the<br/>
lowest ones you can find - to train your points, or if<br/>
you see someone soloing, ask if you can train on the<br/>
mobs they are fighting. Just don&#39;t outdamage them, and<br/>
Feign Death if you get in trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of<br/>
which, keep Feign Death up. It will be your most useful<br/>
skill - as a monk, you will be expected, at later<br/>
levels, to pull the majority of mobs. FD is a great trick<br/>
for this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tiger Claw vs. Round Kick -<br/>
whichever one is learned at a later level is better. I am<br/>
not sure which one is better, off the top of my head,<br/>
but whichever one you get later is better. You will<br/>
get one more attack like this, which is a<br/>
kicking-type of attack. It&#39;s quite nice - Thunderous Kicks can<br/>
top 200 damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the cap for monks is<br/>
14, that is, if you carry more than 15 stones worth<br/>
of equipment, you will suffer a huge AC loss. You<br/>
will want to avoid this at all costs. Test it out for<br/>
yourself, see what weight drops you down. Also, at higher<br/>
levels, you will be able to carry more without weight<br/>
loss, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get past 20 or 30 weight<br/>
allowance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51 champion of Prexus</div>
