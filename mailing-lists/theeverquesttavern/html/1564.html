<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479714923">I have also heard rumors that the lvl of the mob<br/>
that killed you may have something to do with the XP<br/>
loss (ie. You are EXPECTED to get killed by Reds, so<br/>
the xp loss is less, but if a green kills you, you<br/>
loose more). Don&#39;t know if this is true, but I have a<br/>
friend who was trying to measure this at mid way between<br/>
lvl 20. (Grimfeather in NK--red-- killed him a few<br/>
times, and then D&#39;Vinn in CB--green-- killed him a few<br/>
times. He thought he lost more XP getting killed by<br/>
D&#39;Vinn). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the issue of animals-- i don&#39;t harm<br/>
bears or wolves, but I have never heard of loosing xp<br/>
for killing any particular mob. Bears and wolves love<br/>
me, and with the latest patch, I can&#39;t wait till they<br/>
&quot;regard me as an ally.&quot; Sometimes I&#39;ll heal a wolf that&#39;s<br/>
in battle, causing a lowbie to have to flee. (don&#39;t<br/>
worry, I warn them ahead of time, and tell them that if<br/>
they zone and come back having learned not to harm<br/>
Tunare&#39;s guardsmen, I will give them buffs and coin). I<br/>
wonder if this helps my &quot;wolf faction.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have you<br/>
ever been in a battle and had a wandering bear join in<br/>
to help you?? Only happened a few times for me, and<br/>
it was GREAT! No need to charm it--hehe.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW-- why do bears and wolves love me, but any feline<br/>
withint 1/2 a zone RUNS over to bite me!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
