<div id="ygrps-yiv-788148200">I am going to be starting my EQ adventure, but am curious about what <br/>
I need to buy.  Should I buy the basic game and all the expansion <br/>
packs, or just the latest expansion pack?  Are the better expansion <br/>
packs than others?<br/>
<br/>
I guess basicly the question I am asking is.....If you were starting <br/>
from scratch what would you buy?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
