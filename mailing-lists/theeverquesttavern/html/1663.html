<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479175180">We druid roleplayers might be few but we do<br/>
exist. Of course it&#39;s worse when you&#39;re a halfling druid<br/>
roleplayer. &lt;br&gt;I have a lot of emotes that I use. Some are<br/>
very comedic. Such is my outlook of life. (in game at<br/>
least) It got worse when I got wolf form. It also helps<br/>
if you put a little story on your bio so people can<br/>
read it when they inspect you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye<br/>
