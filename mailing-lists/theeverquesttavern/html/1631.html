<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651989192">This must be a big Drinal gathering place . . .<br/>
bigger than Everlore, where NO ONE responded to my post<br/>
about the goings-on in LFAydark. I have two characters<br/>
on Drinal, but I really only play the rogue. Funny<br/>
thing is, someone here by the name of Layline said in<br/>
an earlier post that he is on Drinal -- I was<br/>
looking back at some screenshots, and saw their corpse!<br/>
So, guess we&#39;ve already run into each other, Layline<br/>
