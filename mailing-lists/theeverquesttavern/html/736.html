<div id="ygrps-yiv-357705904">Unfortunately the only thing you can do when you<br/>
have divine aura on is RUN! Yuo cannot cast spells or<br/>
fight anyone, but the fact that nobody can hurt you<br/>
more than makes up for that. One thing to look out<br/>
for, though. For some insane reason you still can be<br/>
STUNNED when you have divine aura, and that will slow<br/>
down your escape. Just be careful and you should be<br/>
able to get the heck out of there in time though ;)</div>
