<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318587236">At only 5 mins long -- I wouldn&#39;t go overboard<br/>
with visuals (print out some glossys of screenshots),<br/>
so you can get more content into the &quot;report.&quot; An<br/>
interesting take would be to discuss how people rollplay<br/>
on-line-- how they use the mask of EQ to make themselves<br/>
out to be something other or better than they are in<br/>
real life. Many people take to heart the &quot;roll play&quot;<br/>
angle. Some people (that i know personally) are more<br/>
social in EQ than they are in real life. Many people who<br/>
are social in RL have problems getting into groups in<br/>
EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll bet we all remeber those players we gouped with<br/>
that roll played well, or chatted with us during camps<br/>
more than those that just<br/>
attacked/rested/attacked/rested. I&#39;ve seen the same kind of reports (actually<br/>
lectures) given on the social aspect of chat rooms on-line<br/>
and the change in communication in the computer age.<br/>
In the seventies and early 80&#39;s -- there were a sect<br/>
of D&Ders that got together, and many would travel<br/>
to conventions once a year or so to meet others with<br/>
similar interests. Communication was a bit part of that<br/>
genre. Now we can have the same kind of experience, but<br/>
don&#39;t have to leave our homes. And I think it&#39;s great<br/>
that no matter my age, race, sex, lifestyle, career,<br/>
etc. I am equal to other players of my level. If i&#39;m a<br/>
30y.o. business professional playing a level 10 char, I<br/>
Kneel in reverence and humility when a lvl 25 char<br/>
buffs/heals/helps me and gives me advice on a certain mob or zone.<br/>
Turns out that the other player may be a 16 y.o. girl<br/>
from Finland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My only advice-- don&#39;t bring up<br/>
the fact that most of the female characters have<br/>
great racks. Yes, it&#39;s true and you must admit that you<br/>
have a secret screenshot collections of the &quot;Best<br/>
Breasts in Norrath&quot; --oh, it really is ONLY me??-- but<br/>
your teacher probably wont appreciate that as a power<br/>
point demonstraction. (Although I will, so feel free to<br/>
e-mail it to me!!!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela laughs so hard he<br/>
