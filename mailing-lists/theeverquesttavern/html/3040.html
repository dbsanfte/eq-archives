<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351182842">I have to agree that the last expansion was more than worth the extra <br/>
money. Most have a hard time making money to than spend 1/2 on going <br/>
here and there for whatever reasons (guild raids, to lvl, to farm for <br/>
more pp, etc.)... I still think my favorite aspect is changing the <br/>
hair, eyes, and colors... My woodelf and necro look damn good if you <br/>
ask me. Now, on top of being a chick playing females characters I can <br/>
get more into the roleplaying aspect since I know what I look like!! <br/>

&gt; PoP came out you had to pay massive amounts of<br/>
&gt; platinum to get teleported anywhere.  With a lot of<br/>
&gt; the newbie quest armor you also have to get rare<br/>
&gt; pieces which will be easier to handle if you can get<br/>
&gt; to cities across the map without having to cross<br/>
&gt; through the lvl 30+ areas to get there.  When I was a<br/>
&gt; newbie I tried to cross the continent and got stuck in<br/>
&gt; the Arena at lvl 9 and was bound (don&#39;t ask) there and<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t get out...  It was pure luck after 6 hours<br/>
&gt; someone walked into the lake area..  Well Good Luck,<br/>
&gt; but if your still not sure just stick with the<br/>
&gt; original til you get your levels up.<br/>
