<div id="ygrps-yiv-246085751">There are 4 choices for race when you want to be<br/>
a Shadowknight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Human-All around decent<br/>
stats, but nothing spectacular. Humans have no night<br/>
vision so you will need a lightsource (At 22 they gain a<br/>
spell tht gives nightvision. Humans are not the most<br/>
imposing, but they do have more choices on where to travel<br/>
because they are not as hated as the &quot;evil&quot; races (Troll,<br/>
ogre, Dark Elf) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dark Elf-A classic race choice<br/>
for a shadowknight is an evil race, such as the Dark<br/>
Elves. Dark Elves are weak, so the heavy armor of a<br/>
shadowknight might bog them down, but quick and good at<br/>
hitting and not being hit. Also, they have a very high<br/>
intelligence if you want your shadowknight to be especially<br/>
proficient in spellcasting. Dark Elves have ultravision, the<br/>
best vision in the game, but are going to be hated by<br/>
EVERYONE except ogres, trolls, and ofcourse Dark<br/>
Elves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Troll-Good at smashing things, basically. Very low<br/>
intelligence, but extremely powerful in combat. They have<br/>
plenty of strength to carry the heaviest equipment and<br/>
stamina to stick it through a fight. They get good night<br/>
vision, a stunning attack, and most importantly,<br/>
regeneration. Regeneration allows a troll to regain hitpoints<br/>
TWICE as fast as other races. However, trolls will be<br/>
hated by everyone so don&#39;t plan on visiting many cities<br/>
any time soon. Basically, trolls are strong, tough,<br/>
and horrendously stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ogres-Pretty much the<br/>
same as a troll. Some minor differences are they get<br/>
better night vision, better all around stats, but not<br/>
regeneration. They are hated like trolls, tough like trolls,<br/>
strong like trolls, and only the slightest bit smarter<br/>
than trolls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So here are your choices.<br/>
Basically, what it all comes down to is choose the type of<br/>
character you want to roleplay. Do you want and mysterious<br/>
and intelligent shadowknight who is quick and agile,<br/>
bringing terror on their foes? Dark Elf. Or, do you want a<br/>
hulking brute with no knowledge of subtlety and<br/>
preffering straight combat over their still useful spells?<br/>
Troll or Ogre. Just choose what you think would be mroe<br/>
fun, and then don&#39;t worry about stats. All characters<br/>
even out stat-wise in one way or another, so don&#39;t<br/>
worry about it =)</div>
