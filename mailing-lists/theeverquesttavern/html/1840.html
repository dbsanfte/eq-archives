<div id="ygrps-yiv-785507439">Yes, Cojim, ports are a great way to make money.<br/>
I lately spent most of mine working on my trade<br/>
skills and finally buying a wisdom deity. I know I can<br/>
make it back quickly . . . on a good day, I can make<br/>
close to 100pp in less than an hour, especially if you<br/>
port people from Kunark.&lt;br&gt;My rant (ah, there&#39;s<br/>
always a catch!) is that lots of people decide they<br/>
don&#39;t need to pay me. I can&#39;t tell you how many people<br/>
I&#39;ve gone out of my way to port lately who have not<br/>
given me a single cp for my trouble. Where have<br/>
everyone&#39;s manners gone? For all you people out there who do<br/>
pay, I&#39;m sorry you have to listen, but everyone else,<br/>
show some respect! Druids and wizards who port you are<br/>
under no obligation to do so! It&#39;s a favor they are<br/>
doing for you--*especially* if they have to come to<br/>
you. I really hate to do it, but it&#39;s gotten so bad<br/>
lately that I write down names of people who are rude or<br/>
won&#39;t pay, and refuse to port them. I also have decided<br/>
to ask for money before we leave, since my modem is<br/>
also slow, and people zone much faster than I do; they<br/>
can be on their way and not wait for me. As one of my<br/>
guildies wisely put is, &quot;You don&#39;t buy your plane tickets<br/>
after your flight.&quot;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m done being irate now. I<br/>
apologize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanissa Noryk of Norraths Keepers&lt;br&gt;Serving Tunare for<br/>
