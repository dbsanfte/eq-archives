<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098045473">Its probly no big deal to most of you, but<br/>
something neat happened to me today when I was searching<br/>
the LesserFaydark up and down for that giant wasp<br/>
Crooksting. After spending hours looking for the wasp, I run<br/>
into another rare spawn named Equestrielle. A unicorn.<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that this unicorn is level 50, and if you<br/>
kill her you are KOS with the Kelethin guards. Two of<br/>
the highest level characters in Lfay at the time, 35<br/>
and 31, had the unicorn con red to them. Does anyone<br/>
know if it drops anything good? I took a screenshot<br/>
and put it under this clubs photos. It is in EQ<br/>
Screenshots. Good hunting to you all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talrasha&lt;br&gt;Level<br/>
