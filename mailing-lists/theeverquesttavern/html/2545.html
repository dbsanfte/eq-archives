<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-118634134">I guess it depends how long you intend to play for. If I had my choice <br/>
over again, I would put everything into STA, regardless of class. <br/>
There are plenty of items out there that will boost a myriad of your <br/>
stats.<br/>
<br/>
And, there are really no races that are superior over the other in <br/>
their classes. Equipment really make or break a class. For starters <br/>
though, the best race with overall stats IMO would be:<br/>
<br/>
Enchanter - Erudite<br/>
Druid - Halfling<br/>
Warrior - Troll<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>

&gt; Hmm..ok here&#39;s a question then? Since I know that<br/>
&gt; I will be playing within a month to two months I<br/>
&gt; need to have a char, just in case my others are wiped<br/>
&gt; out. So I am thinking Enchanter, Druid and yes the all<br/>
&gt; around basher Warrior. My question is this then. When<br/>
&gt; you start the char they ask you to put the points in,<br/>
&gt; so what is a good distrubition of these stats for<br/>
&gt; each char type listed here? Also for these char thypes<br/>
&gt; what are the better races? (I know for war the best is<br/>
&gt; Troll &#39;cause they get regen, but the faction sucks so I<br/>
&gt; might just go with Human.) Hmm..can&#39;t think of anything<br/>
&gt; else so I guess I&#39;ll go for now. *yawn* have to get up<br/>
&gt; early for work tomorrow. Night. The Raven </span></blockquote></div>
