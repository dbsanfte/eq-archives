<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052644015">I have a Halfling Druid on the Mithaniel Marr<br/>
server who is in the area of Rivervale. He is in need of<br/>
armor that is good for a Druid, he already has a<br/>
snakeskin tunic, but needs other stuff. He has some money,<br/>
like around 5pp or so. If you have any spare armor for<br/>
a Druid that you would like to sell, send me a<br/>
message, his name is Gaddwin. thanks! =)</div>
