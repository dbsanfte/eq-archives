<b>Subject:</b> PLEASE Help, I keep getting booted after <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104432697">I keep getting booted after playing for about<br/>
5-10 minutes. I have upgraded everything, ran all<br/>
patches, disabled sound. But nothing works. This has been<br/>
going for 3 days now, ever since the new Velious<br/>
patches. I also added AOL 6.0, but I DO NOT ACCESS the net<br/>
through AOL, I use Bellsouth to get online. I did not<br/>
have these problems before AOL 6.0 or the new patches.<br/>
I have deleted AOL 6.0 from myu comp. Any<br/>
suggestions? &lt;br&gt;BTW, I have a compaq 7470, vodoo3 video, amd<br/>
allegro ess sound.&lt;br&gt;Thanks all</div>
