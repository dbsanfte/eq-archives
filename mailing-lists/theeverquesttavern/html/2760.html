<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057280756">I have heard about a quest that is given by a centuar, in the same <br/>
hut as the crafter armor guys, that you have to take a bag of bread <br/>
loafs to an Innkeeper in Kelethin.  I went to SK and tried to find <br/>
him, I went to the centuar camp and found the crafted armor guys, but <br/>
this other guy was no where to be found.  Has anyone ever heard <br/>
of/done this quest?  Was it removed? Did it ever exist?</div>
