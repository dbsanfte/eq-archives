<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709123401">Hiya, Ok Highkeep is the city in Highhold pass.<br/>
Ok I will tell you that Highhold is a dangerous<br/>
place for a lvl 10 warrior, and that maybe you should<br/>
check butcherblock instead..good exp and loot there,<br/>
but watch out for those trains. If you decide to go I<br/>
will be happy to give you directions, just let me<br/>
know.</div>
