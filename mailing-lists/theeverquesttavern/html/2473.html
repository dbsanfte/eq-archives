<b>Subject:</b> FV to LOIO and the DL run to FV <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-199681270">Alright... here&#39;s the low down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I spent 20<br/>
to 30 as my druid in LOIO and I&#39;ve made the trip<br/>
from FV to LOIO a couple hundred times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And<br/>
since I got the gate to DL I&#39;ve made the run to FV<br/>
about 30 times and to the area outside KC about 50<br/>
times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FV to LOIO is easy. If you&#39;ve got sow and<br/>
invis/camo-- all you have to do is run to water fall and<br/>
follow river to zone. Ignore everything. Nothing&#39;s<br/>
faster than sow there. You&#39;ll make it to zone easy. Most<br/>
things can&#39;t see invis there except for two things. An<br/>
occasional Drogvar (sp?). Stop... go around it. Those are<br/>
mean and might stun you. You&#39;re faster than it with<br/>
sow.. but why take the chance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spiders near as I<br/>
can figure it... can only see you if the Caster<br/>
spider happens to cast See invis on itself or a friend.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t happen often but does happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the run<br/>
from DL to FV is tricky. There&#39;s a couple of ways to<br/>
do it but the easiest is SoW and Invis/Camo. Don&#39;t<br/>
Camo yourself till you get to the tunnel from the<br/>
gladed area to the ice area. Before you enter the<br/>
tunnel... cast camo. By the time you reach the other side--<br/>
it&#39;ll either have dropped or it won&#39;t and you should be<br/>
able to make it all the way to FV without it<br/>
dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot of people prefer to use levitate here but I<br/>
never bother with it. I just sow and camo and run for<br/>
loc 300, -5500. That&#39;s the tunnel into FV. When you<br/>
go on the mountain... have a gate ready in case you<br/>
mess up.. nothing&#39;s faster than you with sow... run<br/>
and count out 1, one thousand, 2, one thousand...<br/>
etc. All the way to 10, one thousand. Stop, spin right<br/>
(to do the fast cast technique-- allows the server to<br/>
know you&#39;ve stopped a second earlier than it might if<br/>
you didn&#39;t spin), and then cast gate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as<br/>
long as you avoid Drovars, Giants, Spiders-- you&#39;ll be<br/>
okay. They&#39;re far enough between and easy enough to see<br/>
that I&#39;ve never had to gate out but once in about 50<br/>
tries. Once Camo dropped too soon and I ran from KC to<br/>
FV zone with 4 mobs on my tail BUT... like I said--<br/>
nothing in DL can catch you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve had Paly and SK<br/>
friends do this run from DL to FV with just sow and<br/>
levitate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.. my comments in no way regard<br/>
Gore. If you&#39;re foolish enough to try wolf form through<br/>
DL OR you attack Gore, my advice will not help you.<br/>
LOL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS... oh and sorry this is so long. But I thought I<br/>
might as well say as an experienced Druid.<br/>
