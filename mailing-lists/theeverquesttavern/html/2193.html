<div id="ygrps-yiv-242749265">I play because I enjoy reading Fantasy genre<br/>
books. Magic, lore, dragons, etc have always interested<br/>
me. Playing EverQuest allows me to interact in a game<br/>
with thousands of other people who share at least one<br/>
common interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve made many friends ingame<br/>
and regardless of distance and limited interaction<br/>
with them in a game environment, I have become close<br/>
with some of them. I suppose it could be seen as a<br/>
step up from the Pen Pal relationships of older<br/>
days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know couples who play, and use the game as a<br/>
place to escape together in something they both<br/>
enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People all over the world play this game and almost<br/>
never worry about race, religion, disabilities,<br/>
illnesses, sexual preference, etc. If you like games and<br/>
enjoy the Sci-Fi or Fantasy realms, you may like<br/>
EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And God help you if you do, cause it can be<br/>
addicting. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Synthe Hateblade&lt;br&gt;Mythic<br/>
