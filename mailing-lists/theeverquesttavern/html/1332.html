<b>Subject:</b> Re: Benefits/Downfalls of Monks? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-500544729">As with all (and yes ALL) classes, monks have<br/>
their drawbacks. Monks, by nature, are not a worldly<br/>
class. Therefore, they do not wear much armor or carry<br/>
anything with them deemed unnecessary. Monks lose a<br/>
defensive bonus if their weight ever exceeds 14, so pack<br/>
light. All good monk armor weighs next to nothing. A<br/>
good idea would be to get woven or netted armor from<br/>
Frogloks, or at least the gloves. Magic gloves count as<br/>
magic weapons with hand-to-hand. While monkeys can use<br/>
blunt weapons, a true monk finds his strength in his<br/>
own body. Monks are also the masters of feigning<br/>
death, which can save the whole group. For listing<br/>
purposes, here are the benefits of a monk:&lt;br&gt;Damage, lots<br/>
of it, and fast as a naked barbarian in<br/>
Everfrost&lt;br&gt;Really excellent looking abilities like the roundhouse<br/>
kick.&lt;br&gt;Feign death, you will find a place in groups very<br/>
easily with this skill&lt;br&gt;Mend wounds-monk only, full<br/>
heal (at least I think it&#39;s full heal)&lt;br&gt;Safe fall-<br/>
again excellent for pullers&lt;br&gt;Never have to worry<br/>
about money, there are very few things you will ever<br/>
really need after cured silk or better armor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now<br/>
for the downfalls:&lt;br&gt;Remember that last statement?<br/>
You&#39;ll really never have the money for anything. Monks<br/>
are probably the poorest class on average. Take your<br/>
loot in plat or gems only. You have to watch for that<br/>
over 14 stoneweight penalty.&lt;br&gt;No armor means more<br/>
damage taken, if you don&#39;t dodge that is&lt;br&gt;Until you<br/>
get feign death, there is not a terrible lot of call<br/>
for monks&lt;br&gt;There are very few monks in the world of<br/>
Norrath, means that you will have to find information from<br/>
outside sources (everlore, allakazam (sp?), etc..) unlike<br/>
druids, where there is one always around the<br/>
corner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember that monks are not tanks, they have no taunt<br/>
skill and cannot take the damage like a tanker.<br/>
Personally I have found my monk to be one of my most<br/>
enjoyable characters to play, simply because I don&#39;t have<br/>
to worry about earning enough cash to by that magic<br/>
weapon or expensive armor. All I need is a good pair of<br/>
gloves and some bandages. (I know some will disagree<br/>
with my anti-weapon for monks stance, but then I don&#39;t<br/>
have anything wrong with a bo stick or other such<br/>
things. I just like the Jackie Chan style action. When<br/>
you rip a gnoll commander&#39;s head off with your fist,<br/>
it just feels better than with a big<br/>
stick.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Druid of Karana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roen&lt;br&gt;Monk<br/>
