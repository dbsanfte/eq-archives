<div id="ygrps-yiv-887384801">Yow, haven&#39;t been here for a while, I guess.<br/>
Didn&#39;t realize someone had asked _me_ something . . .<br/>
I&#39;m flattered to know you think of me as the &quot;master&quot;<br/>
Rogue. I think some very oober Rogues and Blackguards<br/>
might take issue with that, but then, they&#39;d have to<br/>
see me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know how much<br/>
meaningful advice I can give you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armor? I love my<br/>
Small Scarab Breastplate (AC14, +1STR, +1STA, -1CHA or<br/>
DEX, I think, +10HP, HLF, DWF, GNM only). You&#39;re just<br/>
about at the level where you can go to Unrest and score<br/>
a Pristine Giant Carapace. I went when I was 13 or<br/>
14, I think. Very scary, but I solo&#39;ed lots of stuff<br/>
in the Hedge. Then I&#39;d come out and fish in the<br/>
pools while healing (while Hidden, of course). You can<br/>
supposedly find Pristines off of the Giant Scarab Beetles in<br/>
Butcherblock and other places, but I only ever saw one in<br/>
Unrest, off of the Death Beetles. Take the Pristine and<br/>
23 gp to Vacto Molunel in South Kaladim, and he&#39;ll<br/>
give you a SSB. He&#39;ll also make a set of boots and a<br/>
help for you, if you ask nicely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, the<br/>
Gnoll Lariat does proc a stun, but I think it&#39;s only 3<br/>
DAM, 16 Delay (maybe lower?). I used a Tailored Whip<br/>
(7/33) for long time in the off-hand. The Polished<br/>
Granite Tomahawk (PGT) is 6/26, and procs a Berserker<br/>
Strength, which apparently makes you immune from damage for<br/>
a short time. From what I gather, it will proc for<br/>
you at 10th level. Also adds some STR (+15, but takes<br/>
away AGI (-3?)) for the duration of the proc (which is<br/>
random, of course). I think you&#39;d be happy with either of<br/>
these in your off-hand when you get Dual wield (at<br/>
14?). You wno&#39;t be able to solo Grinnix Mucktail, yet<br/>
(the named Gnoll that drops the Tomahawk) - he&#39;s a MOb<br/>
in the mid-20s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weaps? Hey, I used a Giant<br/>
Snake Fang up until I bought a Walrus Tooth for 35pp (I<br/>
suspect you won&#39;t find one of those for a while),<br/>
somewhere in my mid-teens. Just keep your piercing up, of<br/>
course; I like all weapon styles, so I even keep up my<br/>
1HB. Use a Velium War Hammer for that -- again,<br/>
though, you won&#39;t be seeing those anytime soon. A Fine<br/>
Steel mace will be very nice -- anything heavier, and<br/>
you won&#39;t get in enough swings to live long enough to<br/>
increase your skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, I also like Throwing<br/>
as a skill. Sure, it&#39;s expensive and has limited<br/>
range, but getting in a 15 point Critical Strike, or a<br/>
30 point Deadly, is neat. Evidently, you can<br/>
eventually blacksmith throwing javelins, which have a range<br/>
similar to bows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and start collecting poison<br/>
supplies. Unrest is great for this -- collect stacks of<br/>
Zombie skins, and Grave Molds. Skins are used for making<br/>
vials (you&#39;ll need Pottery skill). Two grave molds and<br/>
a suspension make a nice little low-level<br/>
poison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nah, we don&#39;t like to rambnle or<br/>
anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;Rogue of 28 seasons&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
