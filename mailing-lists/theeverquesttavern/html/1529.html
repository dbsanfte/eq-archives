<b>Subject:</b> Re: TWINKING-- a discussion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009113223">Man.. it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve read the<br/>
boards. I wanted to contribute more on this twinking<br/>
discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most significant thing I want to add is<br/>
this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twinking is a double edged sword-- like most things in<br/>
life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twinking can be done for good or evil. Well or very badly.<br/>
I can&#39;t wait till I don&#39;t have to worry about not<br/>
having enough money for spells, and only 124 wis.<br/>
=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Course, I&#39;ve had friends tell me I should just start<br/>
making backpacks and sets of cured silks. Just not<br/>
enough time to hunt down materials. =)&lt;br&gt;I already know<br/>
I will twink my secondary characters at some point.<br/>
I don&#39;t plan on hurting anyone by doing so or even<br/>
giving them anything super rare. But stuff easily<br/>
accessible once I get to level 45+ with my druid... etc.<br/>
Course-- that&#39;s another 15 levels. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
