<div id="ygrps-yiv-142510067">==============================================&lt;br&gt;Twinstar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Synopsis: Twinstar, a kind hearted Dark Elf, has just<br/>
learned that if she doesn&#39;t leave her home in Neriak<br/>
immediately and travel the world in search for answers to<br/>
questions she doesn&#39;t hasn&#39;t formed, she&#39;ll bring an end to<br/>
the Norrath forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excerpt from Chapter 1:<br/>
The<br/>
Gypsy&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twinstar sat alone, aside from her loyal skeletal pet<br/>
standing guard, in the grass at the base of a dark and<br/>
dreary hill in an already dark and dreary forest. Her<br/>
eyes were filled with fear and confusion and she had a<br/>
headache from thinking too much. In her hands, she fumbled<br/>
slowly with a large precious stone, red in color.<br/>
Perhaps it was a ruby, but she wasn∩┐╜t sure; she was just<br/>
trying to distract herself from why she was really here.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a distance she could see the backside of an<br/>
ancient and long-since ruined temple, cursed to be<br/>
forever haunted by the undead. Such a temple, so close to<br/>
the entrance to her home city, proved convenient<br/>
training grounds for the warriors and mages of her people,<br/>
the Dark Elves of Norrath. On this side of the<br/>
temple, however, was nothing of any importance or<br/>
consequence, so Twinstar knew this was a place she could be<br/>
alone. And today she needed her privacy more than ever.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do you think she was serious?&quot; Came a familiar and<br/>
friendly voice. She glanced up at the source of the voice,<br/>
her pet. In her mind, she could see his lips moving<br/>
as the words had formed, but he had no lips. She<br/>
laughed a little at the thought, but her mood stifled it<br/>
quickly. He was merely a summoned pet, no different from<br/>
any other. Except that he could talk and he was a<br/>
fully sentient being, capable of making his own<br/>
decisions; not a mindless drone like every other pet<br/>
Twinstar had ever heard of. Why he was so different was<br/>
still a mystery to both of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a few<br/>
moments, she returned her gaze returned to the stone in<br/>
her hands. &quot;I... I don∩┐╜t know, Dolan,&quot; she responded<br/>
distantly. Her voice was weak and quiet, strained by the<br/>
weight on her shoulders. Her whole body felt the weight.<br/>
She sat there for several moments in silence before<br/>
she continued. &quot;I wish I could just shrug this off--I<br/>
would have shrugged it off... but she knew about you.<br/>
How can I explain that away?∩┐╜ Dolan stood there in<br/>
silence, staring off into space as though he were the<br/>
witless pet he was supposed to be. He knew as well as she<br/>
did how important it was that they keep his<br/>
uniqueness a secret. Most Dark Elves were suspicious and<br/>
superstitious folk; if anyone found out, the consequences could<br/>
be disastrous. Twinstar had every right to be<br/>
concerned for that reason alone. If they couldn∩┐╜t explain<br/>
that, then everything else the Gypsy had told them<br/>
would hold an undeniable credibility and it was that<br/>
point that brought them here today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;There has<br/>
to be plenty of reasonable explanations. Maybe she<br/>
just figured it out? We couldn∩┐╜t have expected to keep<br/>
this secret forever,&quot; he said finally. It was a weak<br/>
argument, he knew, but it was all he could offer.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;But she said your name, Dolan, remember? Maybe she<br/>
figured it out, but then how could she have known your<br/>
name?&quot; Twinstar was becoming more and more sure that<br/>
there was no way the Gypsy could have known that much.<br/>
They∩┐╜d spent the last few years guarding this secret<br/>
fiercely. She∩┐╜d told only one person and he∩┐╜d never betray<br/>
her, she was sure of it. There wasn∩┐╜t any way she<br/>
could explain this away. Her mood tipped even further<br/>
down, now. &quot;I think we∩┐╜re in much deeper than either of<br/>
us realize.&quot;<br/>
