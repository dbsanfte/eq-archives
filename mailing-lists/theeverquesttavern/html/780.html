<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312877005">Another thing to consider is the weapons each<br/>
combatant uses. If the paladin is swinging around a<br/>
Ghoulbane (highly unlikely at level 30 but still worth<br/>
pondering) then the pet is negligible. SK pets are half the<br/>
levels of their masters. That means the paladin has to<br/>
deal with a level 15 mob. Should go down pretty<br/>
easily. To my knowledge, there is no &quot;anti-paladin&quot;<br/>
weapon out there. Advantage holy knight.&lt;br&gt; Armor is<br/>
pretty balanced; both Ro and Darkforge are pretty equal.<br/>
I don&#39;t think either will have Umbral or Valorium,<br/>
but even then, they&#39;re fairly equal.&lt;br&gt; Harm touch<br/>
will take off 301 damage, Lay on Hands heals for 750.<br/>
The paladin could take a considerable amount of<br/>
damage and harm touch and negate the damage. Again, this<br/>
favors the paladin.&lt;br&gt; But, necro-based spells are<br/>
wicked. Last night I ran into Meldrath, gnome necro,<br/>
leader of the minos in steamfont. He had boil blood,<br/>
bonds of death, engulfing darkness, and fear on me.<br/>
Needless to say I was his female dog. I made it out only<br/>
because of some sick paladin buffs and the same paladin<br/>
who saved me. I&#39;m pretty scared of necros right now,<br/>
but that paladin whooped up on Meldrath last<br/>
night.&lt;br&gt; It really comes down to the player. SKs and<br/>
pallys are pretty equal in a straight up duel. But<br/>
knowing the background of most SKs, they would love for<br/>
nothing more but to lace into you with all their spells<br/>
while you&#39;re meditating and unbuffed.</div>
