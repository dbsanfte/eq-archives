<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198388359">Um, yeah. Go look at the main EQ page. Mainly,<br/>
you need to have a system that will run DirectX 8.1<br/>
(not 8.0!). What this boils down to is Win98 or above,<br/>
even if you don&#39;t plan on buying Luclin. I forget what<br/>
the rest of the specs are, but don&#39;t plan on doing<br/>
Luclin with less than 512 MB of RAM (!) if you want to<br/>
see the new character models. They say it will run<br/>
with 128 if you turn them off, but I can&#39;t help you on<br/>
that yet. Good luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
