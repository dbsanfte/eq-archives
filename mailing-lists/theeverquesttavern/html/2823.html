<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804038693">Thought of one more.  What allows casters to cast buffs on everyone <br/>
in range of the buff?  I was standing in Nexus the other night when a <br/>
level 60 enchanter and a level 60 cleric casted KEI and Ageo on <br/>
everyone in the middle of the nexus!  talk about lag  :)<br/>

&gt; Ok, I have been playing EQ for about a year, and I feel that I have <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; pretty good grasp on what is going on.  I have a 32 wizard, a 27 <br/>
&gt; warrior, 21 monk, 16 cleric, and 10 shaman (probably 11 by the time <br/>
&gt; you guys respond to this).  I just have a few questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  When casting a spell, the spell type (evocation for nukes, <br/>
&gt; Conjuratoin for summoning, etc.) effects weather you fizzle or not, <br/>
&gt; for the most part and chanelling effects if your spell is inturpted <br/>
&gt; or resited, to a point.  Right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  I know there are a lot of really good INT gear out there.  But <br/>
&gt; what is some good shaman gear?  I have gone to bazaar and bought <br/>
him <br/>
&gt; a Spine Chill Spear (10:28 3agi 6wis 10svcold, i think) and a 3wis <br/>
&gt; ring, but what else could I get him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  Where can I go with my wizard?  the level 32 one.  I got board <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; HK and I am floating around now just wondering where to go.  I am <br/>
&gt; just porting and getting money atm, but i want to get to level 34 <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; 39 to get the rest of my port spells.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>
