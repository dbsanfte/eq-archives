<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135073170">2 things...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Tis a great dread day<br/>
indeed. I had not realized my fair home was in such dire<br/>
dangers. I venture around often looking for things that I<br/>
must do. Perhaps I shall need to venture forth and<br/>
help my City once more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) I am also on Drinal.<br/>
These are dark times, he of the dwarves. I am Fatedhue<br/>
of the Wood Elves belonging to nature. My brothers<br/>
and sisters in arms are the Tribunal of Antiquities.<br/>
I wish you luck Dwarf. If you see that I am on, and<br/>
I am unoccupied-- there is an easy to acquire staff<br/>
of magic known as the Runed Totem Staff. Perhaps I<br/>
can track down it&#39;s location in the plains of South<br/>
Karana...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been preoccupied lately and am not sure when<br/>
I shall be able to do so (OOC: Read RL been<br/>
whipping my behind lately)...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May the Mother&#39;s<br/>
impish nature and strong, ferocious spirit shine upon<br/>
all...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic-- Druid of Faith in Tunare...&lt;br&gt;the<br/>
Mother of All</div>
