<div id="ygrps-yiv-958592197">Not that I&#39;m knowledgable but it&#39;s usually easier<br/>
to eliminate the possibility of software. Directx 7<br/>
and if that&#39;s already okay-- maybe<br/>
uninstall/reinstall of EQ. Maybe something glitched on install. --<br/>
it&#39;s a pain redoing the patches... but... Could solve<br/>
the issue. Also, maybe it&#39;s an issue with drivers?<br/>
Reset to VGA mode and then reinstall the drivers...<br/>
might work. Or get latest drivers if that doesn&#39;t<br/>
work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those are the things I&#39;d try first at any rate... of<br/>
course if anyone knows of an actual issue with those<br/>
cards and EQ... forget about me. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
