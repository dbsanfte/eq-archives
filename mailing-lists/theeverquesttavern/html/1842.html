<div id="ygrps-yiv-94804391">Hey, all!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I play a 29 Wizard that just got<br/>
his port spells. I have made several Hotkeys that<br/>
give OOC speaches advertising my Port destinations,<br/>
and also asking for donations. Asking for donations<br/>
usually gets you more than the price you would ask, and<br/>
you (almost) never get someone who refuses to<br/>
pay...they know that there is a price up front. If someone<br/>
is just broke and desperate, I&#39;m always happy to<br/>
give them a port to help out. Asking for donations is<br/>
a good way to avoid the &quot;Gee...I thought it was for<br/>
free&quot; thing, and everyone is happy. Give it a<br/>
try!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shahazred Muhajadin&lt;br&gt;29 Wizard on Rotcet Nife&lt;br&gt;Shadows<br/>
