<div id="ygrps-yiv-584749129">Oh yeah. Remember how important it was to learn<br/>
about pullers or teaching nukers to time nukes? Grin.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I STILL do the stackable loot stuff with lower<br/>
level characters. LOL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember when a Backpack<br/>
in every slot in the bank seemed impossible? Now I&#39;m<br/>
pondering spending all my plat on tailored backpacks for<br/>
every slot that has a backpack on my Druid.<br/>
LOL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At level 5, when I started over again in 2000... my<br/>
experience caused people to gasp over the fact that I could<br/>
CR so well for newbies on Orc Hill. LOL. I still<br/>
remember thinking-- poor people. I had many a CR where<br/>
people kept saying, &quot;no not that body. That&#39;s the wrong<br/>
one.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember one newbie I pulled 4 bodies for before<br/>
we got the one with all the equipment. I still to<br/>
this day can&#39;t be sure there weren&#39;t more&lt;br&gt;lying<br/>
around. Grin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And to think I was able to do it b/c<br/>
I had one very good piece of knowledge. Druid Camo<br/>
spell. At level five, knowing it&#39;s importance... it was<br/>
like the third spell I bought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.. man. You know we could go on like this forever.<br/>
Sigh. Ahh the memories.</div>
