<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647744595">Hehe just took down one of the dastardly hill<br/>
giants, our group was looking for SG but we couldnt find<br/>
any *sigh* We were in the west commonlands and we had<br/>
our druid out tracking for them, Iuna found one and<br/>
she ran it around in circles hiting it with spells<br/>
from time to time. The rest of us meanwhile were hot<br/>
at its heals slashing it away. We all cheered as it<br/>
collapsed to the ground, with barley a scratch done to us!<br/>
It had about 50 gold as loot, but we didnt mind<br/>
because the satisfaction was enough. Ill have my<br/>
screenshot of the corpse up soon =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Gillerin: i am<br/>
interested in your black pearl and lizardscale cloak give me<br/>
a tell sometime, ill be on as Kaylin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin<br/>

isnt that tough as long as you have 2 groups (around<br/>
lvl 30)good side is you will be getting a holy sword<br/>
and they will be getting all the money from the<br/>
monsters, i made around 50pp down there! Even with the 2<br/>
groups! btw exp is good too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;........one more<br/>
thing you can find row boats in the ocean of tears, no<br/>
skill involved with driving them, just click and<br/>
go........</div>
