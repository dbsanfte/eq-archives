<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080800991">Hello out there. I managed to go from 1-9 in the<br/>
swamp and grobb and now I&#39;m in EC. I had an ogre friend<br/>
escort over the dunes of North Ro and Oasis to get to<br/>
the EC and the tunnel. We continued on through to the<br/>
Nek forest to get to the foreign quarter of Neriak. I<br/>
am bound there. FQ is good because I can hunt in EC<br/>
(camp the orc camps) or solo in nek forest and then<br/>
sell to DEs in FQ. I&#39;m rapidly approaching a<br/>
crossroads. I&#39;ve been reading around about how WC and it&#39;s<br/>
wisps can be lucrative but all the NPCs (hihglevel<br/>
spawns) seem very dangerous. Another option might be the<br/>
lavastorm mts. Two questions. Once I hit 14th level and I<br/>
need to get my spells (remember I am a shaman) I have<br/>
to go back to the swamp to get them? Should I try to<br/>
buy a teleport? I&#39;m really looking forward to bind so<br/>
I can venture further. Another question is what<br/>
would be a better spot to lvl 12 up, WC or Lava MTs?<br/>
What I really need is a bud to teleport me back to<br/>
grobb to get my 14th level spells. Appreciate any<br/>
advice veteran players have. More questions: I am<br/>
frequently encumbered by my banded armor I heard someone<br/>
talk on another forum about a minthril tunic and gator<br/>
legs. Should I stick with all my banded and loot less<br/>
trash. I usually just gate to neriak to dump the trash<br/>
anyway. Despite the tunnel&#39;s proximity I&#39;m a sitting duck<br/>
running through EC to get to it even with SOW<br/>
encumberred. I have been killed twice by sargent Slate ( a<br/>
good guy NPC-guard type by the inns in EC) now I stick<br/>
to the tops of hills when I cross from the orc camps<br/>
to the tunnel at NRO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plenty of questions<br/>
about armor, where to play and getting back to Grobb.<br/>
Getting through NRO and Oasis on my own is most likely a<br/>
no-go. I tried once and the desert madmen were very<br/>
aggressive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;let me know. Most of the posting have been for Good<br/>
characters but I assume there are a couple of experienced<br/>
players whho have played both sides of goodness vs evil<br/>
and can help me out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grumph, 12 lvl shaman<br/>
