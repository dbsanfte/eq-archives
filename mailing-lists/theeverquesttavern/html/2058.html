<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608517943">For those of ya&#39;ll that have some of the<br/>
expansions and I think even the basic set.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you<br/>
look in the directory with the game files... there&#39;s a<br/>
file called eqmanual_supplement.doc and one that&#39;s in<br/>
txt format as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you open that up, it&#39;s<br/>
got a list of a LOT of different things. One of the<br/>
key things is that it gives an example of time<br/>
delayed macros and almost all the commands you&#39;d ever<br/>
need to know. Ideally one would print it out and thumb<br/>
through it (but I&#39;ve never done it yet like a doof.<br/>
LOL)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhoo.. figured ppl asking about this stuff would want to<br/>
know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic&lt;br&gt;Just reached 39 and love my GD gg<br/>
spell. Heh&lt;br&gt;shooman out-- Drinal server</div>
