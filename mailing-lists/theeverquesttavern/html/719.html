<div id="ygrps-yiv-180138485">The higher level you are, the less level<br/>
differences matter. But an easy way to help him catch up<br/>
would be to just not group, and make sure he does over<br/>
50% damage before you kill the target.&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t take<br/>
on anything that cons red to him though. Just black<br/>
and yellow.</div>
