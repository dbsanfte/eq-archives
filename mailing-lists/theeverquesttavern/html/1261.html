<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019382423">No real quests to get any armor yet. You can pick<br/>
up some patchwork armor pretty cheap, which is<br/>
decent at low levels. It&#39;s made by players using the<br/>
Tailoring Trade Skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then you can move up to<br/>
banded, which is made with the Smithing Trade Skill by<br/>
players. Usually it&#39;s around 1pp per AC. You can probably<br/>
be in full banded by level 10 or so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once<br/>
you outgrow that, I estimate you could be in full<br/>
bronze by level 15. Bronze randomly drops off of level<br/>
30-ish mobs - a good place to try to get some is if<br/>
someone is killing the barbarians in West Karana. Bronze<br/>
should last you quite a while; once you&#39;ve outgrown it,<br/>
you&#39;ll know what to do next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;53<br/>
