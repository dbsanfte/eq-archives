<div id="ygrps-yiv-903158385">That is very funny to hear you see, because that<br/>
is EXACTLY what I and many others went through<br/>
waiting for EQ to be released. It can be rather<br/>
nerve-racking but you just have t wait it out and suck up every<br/>
piece of info on EQ you can find until you get it!<br/>
You&#39;ll make it, but I admit that you probably won&#39;t<br/>
retain most of your previous mental capabilities after<br/>
the fiasco, such as I have =)</div>
