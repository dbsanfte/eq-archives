<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636585425">Hello = ) I felt I had to respond to this because<br/>
some people think that pets take a large amount of<br/>
group exp and so dont like to group with pet classes. I<br/>
have even had one person who told me that pets take<br/>
75% of group exp LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow, the only thing I<br/>
have ever found actually written on this subject is in<br/>
Primas Official Strategy Guide to EQ Ruins of Kunark,<br/>
Revised and Expanded. It says on page<br/>
233:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Experience. When soloing with a pet, if the pet inflicts at<br/>
least half the damage on a mob that dies, the pet will<br/>
take up to half of the exp. When grouping with a pet,<br/>
the chance of your pet taking exp, and the amount of<br/>
exp it takes, will decrease significantly.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
hope this helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Venture T&#39;Asp&lt;br&gt;45 Necro on<br/>
