<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591329626">One more thing, I see some people who have things<br/>
that they say every time they cast a spell. For<br/>
example, I was traveling with a barbarian and whenever he<br/>
casted a healing spell he said something like, &quot;As I hit<br/>
you on the head *wack* BE HEALED.&quot; How do I do that.<br/>
can you make it so you only hit one button?</div>
