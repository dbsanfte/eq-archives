<div id="ygrps-yiv-992105433">Hey there, welcome to EQ and the club. Probably<br/>
the next best place for you will be the official EQ<br/>
boards -- go to http:&#92;&#92;eqlive.station.sony.com, and<br/>
click on Forums. Lots of good info and helpful people<br/>
there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there are &quot;spoiler&quot; sites -- so named beause they<br/>
spoil the fun of seeing things for the first time and<br/>
trying to figure things out on your own. That being<br/>
said, they do help you figure out what&#39;s going on. Here<br/>
are my<br/>
faves:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;www.everlore.com&lt;br&gt;www.allakhazam.com&lt;br&gt;http:&#92;&#92;eq.castersrealm.com&lt;br&gt;www.eqatlas.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last is especially helpful -- maps to virtually<br/>
all the zones. I usually go there after visiting a<br/>
zone for the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just keep in mind --<br/>
this is ths best time you&#39;ll have in EQ, when you<br/>
often have no idea what&#39;s going on, what anything does,<br/>
or how to do it. Enjoy it, and don&#39;t be afraid to<br/>
die, especially early on. Some of us die two o three<br/>
times a night . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht, 27th level Dwarf<br/>
Rogue&lt;br&gt;Nazbeku, 12th level Troll Shadow Knight&lt;br&gt;Uenlaenae, 8th<br/>
level Wood Elf Warrioress&lt;br&gt;(all on the Drinal server,<br/>
not a bad place)&lt;br&gt;(oh, and for servers -- any blue<br/>
one is fine; except for Antonius Bayle (which is<br/>
physically located in Europe) (unless that&#39;s where you are .<br/>
. .))</div>
