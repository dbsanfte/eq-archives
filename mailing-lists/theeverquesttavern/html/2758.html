Depending on your sever economy these items should be pretty cheap to <br/>
purchase, somewhere around 1200pp for all 3. With the expansions <br/>
these have become cheap, these are for the most part really old <br/>
items. An alternative to spending your hard earned plat is to quest <br/>
for your wis, this is a decent quest. Lol was one of those you had to <br/>
be aware of folks trying to KS at one point, but relatively the piece <br/>
isn&#39;t that sought after anymore and should be cake for lvl 16+.<br/>

If you go talk to Rarnan Lapice on the top floor of the temple of <br/>
divine light in Erudin, he will tell you to fetch a book from the <br/>
library. This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest. The <br/>
librarian tells you she doesn&#39;t have it but that a person on the top <br/>
floor knows the person who last checked it out. When you ask him, he <br/>
tells you that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro <br/>
Finharn and that he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the <br/>
state. He tells you to go talk to his sister Nolusia who is in the <br/>
Erudin Palace. Once there, she says to meet her just outside the <br/>
hotel in town to talk to her. When you meet her, she explains that <br/>
her brother is still alive. Her brother is at Crows (It seems he is <br/>
sick and is in need of some Erud&#39;s Tonic. This is a side quest). <br/>
<br/>
Go to Qeynos and talk to him. Ask him about Highpass and ask about <br/>
The Testament of Vanear, and he tells you that he did indeed buy page <br/>
30 from a man named Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently <br/>
stolen by a man wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this <br/>
guard was still in Highpass, because he could &quot;feel it&quot;. He also says <br/>
that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you <br/>
go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see a lake <br/>
or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a <br/>
hidden camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is <br/>
Dyllin Starshine. Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a <br/>
sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport). <br/>
Beware that any smugglers around him will come to his aid. Faction <br/>
hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard, +Guards of <br/>
Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers) The <br/>
faction hits for him are pretty large, so be aware after that of <br/>
potentially slipping to KOS in Qeynos. <br/>
<br/>
After going back to Qeynos, go back to Moodoro and say I want page <br/>
34. He says ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty smart of me <br/>
to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn&#39;t matter if I get <br/>
it because the work is fiction anyway. He then offers to play a game <br/>
with you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if <br/>
that one card is a jester he will give you the page. Along with the <br/>
jester, you might also draw the King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight. <br/>
[Note - keep the Knights and give them to the dwarf on Eriolissi <br/>
Island for a reward]. Once the whole thing is combined you get the <br/>
Testament of Vanear, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is <br/>
a no drop lore item. You can keep the testament and use it, or you <br/>
can return the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some <br/>
platinum. <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: I am told that you can avoid Erudin completely by giving <br/>
Moodoro Finharn 2gp (the same guy that you get page 34 from) and he <br/>
gives you the 2-slot book of the testament of Vanear. Once you get <br/>
the book, you can combine the page you get from Moodoro (by playing <br/>
his card game) and the other page from Dylin in HighHold Pass and <br/>
you&#39;ve got the book! No need to go to Erudia. And because Moodoro <br/>
sometimes hangs out at one of the sewer entrances, evil races could <br/>
sneak in and get the book, too)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t bother with Eruidin the Qeynos way works. This quest is for :<br/>

&gt; get me up to level 50 ish or so. Even though you arent on the <br/>
server <br/>

&gt; plus the estimated value of said items, would prove very helpfull. <br/>
If <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hail,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have been at this stoopid game for close to 3 years. My <br/>
crowning <br/>
&gt; &gt; achievement so far (150 days played, cause I love to &#39;smell the <br/>
&gt; &gt; flowers&#39;) is lvl 60 epiced shaman with complete spellbook<br/>
&gt; &gt; (no &#39;Ancient Scrolls&#39; yet) and 25 AA pts. Even after playing EQ <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; &gt; this amount of time there is so much I am unfamiliar with, mostly <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; old world, feel like newbie often :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I do however have humble knowledge of the Barbarian Shaman class, <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; continent of Antonica and many of the kunark and velious zones. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; hang out mostly in luclin zones atm. I belong to a smallish guild <br/>
&gt; (60 <br/>
&gt; &gt; members) that I have been in for 2 years (since early 30&#39;s) we <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; &gt; just now approaching some of the higher end encounters.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I know I will learn from you folks and hopefully be able to <br/>
&gt; &gt; contribute in some humble manner.<br/>
