system. Before doing that you also must contact EQ i think about your <br/>
account so it doesn&#39;t get erased or something call (858) 537-0898 <br/>

and buying a computer. If you have to buy a new computer, I suggest <br/>
selling the old one, to help contribute to it. A good computer yet <br/>
quite prcy is the new Area-51 AlienWare Computer. Inform me as soon <br/>
as possible! Thx! ~~~Ziward <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok here are the specs (I think. Sorry I am not too computer swavey): <br/>
<br/>
I know for a fact it has a pen II<br/>
umm..the processor? is that the chip? 200MHz..I think? Is that <br/>
written on the mother board itself? &#39;cause if it is I can check that <br/>
tomorrow night and post that for you.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a cobbled together computer so I really didn&#39;t buy it from a <br/>
store. (My friends helped me put it together after I smoke checked <br/>
the last hard drive.)<br/>
<br/>
I have a 10G HD<br/>
<br/>
56X CD-Rom<br/>
<br/>
At the moment I have 230MB? of RAM. It uses some old mem chips and <br/>
SDRAM.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the new vid card:<br/>
It&#39;s a Verto. Specs are: GeForce2 MX200 32MB SDRAM<br/>
2D/3D Graphics processor. It&#39;s AGP (The vid card I have in right now <br/>
is a PCI)<br/>
<br/>
On the side of the box it says for minimum requirements:<br/>
Intel Pen II, 1 availabe AGP slot, 64MB Ram, CD-Rom Drive, 10MB <br/>
available disk space, Win 95/98 or higher, Win NT 4.0 with service <br/>
pack 5 or 6, and Linux OS<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got all of that, I think. I don&#39;t know what these are:<br/>
Win NT 4.0 with service pack 5 or 6, and Linux OS <br/>
So I can&#39;t tell you if they are on my comp or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a store not too far from where I live that is really cool <br/>
about computers. Apparently they are buying computers all the time, <br/>
and of course selling them too. I went to Best Buy (As it is close to <br/>
where I live) and the cheapest system they have is for $599.00. That <br/>
is a bit out of my price range (LOL Like $300.00). And all of the <br/>
systems are Pen IV and have Win XP on them. I only want a Pen III and <br/>
I definatly want to keep Win 98! <br/>
<br/>
I hope this info helps. Like I said, there is that computer store not <br/>
too far from here. A friend of mine is going to take me there this <br/>
Friday so I can check it out and see how cool they are. I&#39;m sure that <br/>
there is going to be a price difference, but I don&#39;t know how much <br/>
since I want to keep my hard drive and mem sticks.</div>
