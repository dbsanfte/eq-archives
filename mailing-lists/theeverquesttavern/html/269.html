<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-967392766">I have just started a site for Innoruuk&#39;s Bane.<br/>
It is another YahooClub, because I find it an<br/>
excellent setup with a very handy message board system as<br/>
well as the pictures, calanders, and chat rooms.<br/>
Anyway, the site is at<br/>
&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/innoruuksbane">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/innoruuksbane</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/innoruuksbane&lt;/a">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/innoruuksbane&lt;/a</a>&gt; . It is primarily for the members of the guild,<br/>
but others are welcome to come on in and look around,<br/>
especially if you wish to join =) I warn you, this site is<br/>
still under HEAVY CONSTRUCTION! There is hardly a thing<br/>
there because I literally created it 30 seconds ago, so<br/>
don&#39;t be scared off by the lack of stuff. Just wanted<br/>
to let you know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trellan Hawksight, Wood Elf<br/>
