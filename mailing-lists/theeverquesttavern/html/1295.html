<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161613762">I too have the look of almost all leather, save<br/>
for my arms and forearms. Unfortunately this is a<br/>
curse that we druids have, we look pretty much the same<br/>
from lvl 8 until lvl 45 or whenever we can start<br/>
getting our hands on planar armor. &lt;br&gt;My arms are bone<br/>
armplates, which give a chain look, and my forearms<br/>
alternate between leather and bare, depending on whether<br/>
the graphics pick up on my reinforced bracer or my<br/>
Chipped bone bracelet. It is possible to break out of the<br/>
leather look with a Brown Chitin Protector (gives a brown<br/>
plate look to chest) or for halfling druids, there is a<br/>
scarab armor that gives a green plate look (it&#39;s a quest<br/>
out of Kaladim, if I&#39;m correct, but I&#39;ve seen the<br/>
helm, good lookin for a lil&#39; guy). As for legs, I&#39;ve<br/>
heard that barbed leggings (or something like that)<br/>
gives a black plate look, but I am unsure of<br/>
this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;::Nukai shrugs::&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf</div>
