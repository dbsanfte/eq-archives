<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845358949">1) Make sure your computer meets the recommended<br/>
system requirements for playing EverQuest. I would not<br/>
trust the &quot;minimum system requirements&quot; to provide any<br/>
sort of enjoyable experience with this or any game.<br/>
&quot;Recomended system requirements&quot; is what they designed the<br/>
game for. &quot;Minimum system requirements&quot; is what the<br/>
marketing guys put on there to broaden the potential<br/>
customer base (regardless of the fact that the game sucks<br/>
when played under those circumstances).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Get<br/>
Direct X 7.a if you don&#39;t have it already.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3)<br/>
Stop all other applications or memory resident<br/>
programs while playing EQ, such as Norton Auto Protect,<br/>
ICQ, etc. I have found this helps me<br/>
personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Make sure you have the latest drivers for your<br/>
video card.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info can be found at<br/>
www.everquest.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar Mirraghost&lt;br&gt;29<br/>
