<div id="ygrps-yiv-209596477">The true effects of increased AGI are debated.<br/>
The going belief is that an increase in AGI by 4 or 5<br/>
= an increase in raw AC of 1. So wearing one of<br/>
your braces, the AGI bonus would have an effect of<br/>
giving you about +2AC. This is in addition to the bonus<br/>
AGI normally gives--- rumor has it that AGI helps<br/>
your defensive skills (Dodge, Parry, Riposte, etc),<br/>
and that with a high AGI you will evade hits or take<br/>
a fraction less damage from hits. In the VERY old<br/>
days it was believed (and may have been true) that a<br/>
higher AGI resulted in a higher natural running speed as<br/>
well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know someone who tried experimenting<br/>
with AGI, and SWORE that buffed in all AGI gear with a<br/>
VERY high AGI, he would fight an even mob solo (he was<br/>
a warrior) and take only a few hits during the<br/>
whole battle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for not being able to keep<br/>
agro-- not sure, but here&#39;s a thought-- IF the warrior<br/>
is doing significant damage, AND therefore not<br/>
causing a need for Clerics to heal, AND the nukers aren&#39;t<br/>
nuke-happy, AND the warrior&#39;s taunt is up, AND he is<br/>
outdamaging other melee, then he should be able to keep agro<br/>
even if the mob can&#39;t hit him well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I admit,<br/>
the benefits of AGI are confusing to me. Generally<br/>
tanks are more concerned with offensive power than<br/>
defensive. If you are a tank class that likes to solo (not<br/>
easy for sure), AGI and AC items might be what you<br/>
want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the answer is to test it out a bit more. If<br/>
you haven&#39;t maxed out your offensive and defensive<br/>
skills, maybe work the new bracer into your armor a<br/>
bit---</div>
