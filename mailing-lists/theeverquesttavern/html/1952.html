<div id="ygrps-yiv-695392492">I just read this whole message since I just<br/>
passed it by before. I&#39;m not really interested in EQ<br/>
dating since I&#39;m married and all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was about to<br/>
dismiss it again as your standard &quot;come to my club&quot; spam,<br/>
then I got to that last line.. Quoted Below.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;and only thing is&lt;br&gt;this club does not<br/>
accept&lt;br&gt;swingers/mate swappings&lt;br&gt;or any other<br/>
alternative&lt;br&gt;lifestyle choice that some&lt;br&gt;make and so if your<br/>
into&lt;br&gt;any of those then please&lt;br&gt;step away from the<br/>
club!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, what... People who lead alternative lifestyles<br/>
don∩┐╜t date? Why exclude those with interesting<br/>
interests? It seems to me that your average EQ player<br/>
already has some unique interests. Your probably<br/>
excluding a large number of players by only welcoming<br/>
people you consider ∩┐╜Normal∩┐╜. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why stop there?<br/>
Why not exclude smokers. And fat people. And people<br/>
with red hair. Oh, and who would want to date a<br/>
paraplegic. In fact, let∩┐╜s not let any cripples in. Just fine<br/>
normal breeding stock, from a good family. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh<br/>
well. Have fun in your club.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry for the rant<br/>
but this kind of bigotry hit∩┐╜s too close to<br/>
home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zen</div>
