<b>Subject:</b> Cast-Iron Rapier?????? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106061814">I never saw this item before today, when I bought<br/>
it from a vendor in Kelethin for 6 gold and some<br/>
silver... Stats are DMG 4 DLY 23 WT 5.0 Class: War Shd Rng<br/>
Brd Rog Race:all. These stats are better then a<br/>
bronze rapier and it is less expansive! A bronze Rapier<br/>
from a vendor goes for around 5pp. Also the Cast-iron<br/>
Rapier looks like a sword when equiped (like the rusty<br/>
ones). Who can tell me more about this weapon and where<br/>
it is found? It&#39;s a great weapon for my newby bard<br/>
(now lvl 3 nearly 4). I thought it might be a summoned<br/>
weapon because it sounded to good to be through, but it<br/>
would not be at a vendor then also I logged out and<br/>
back on and to my joy it was still on my char. So<br/>
please if anyone knows more on this weapon tell<br/>
me!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alrix,&lt;br&gt;Very Happy Bard of 3 seasons,&lt;br&gt;Beroxxulous.</div>
