<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401761590">I&#39;ve always heard that gaining levels is<br/>
dependent upon race. Humans gain levels the fastest, then<br/>
various elves and half elves, then dwarves and halflings<br/>
erudites and barbarians, then gnomes, followed by ogres<br/>
trolls and finally iksar. I don&#39;t think intelligence has<br/>
anything to do with this, I think it is a balancing factor<br/>
for basic race traits. All in all, if you play your<br/>
character enough, he will gain his levels.</div>
