<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326279461">half elves are good but my personal opinion is<br/>
that for druid or ranger maybe a wood elf would be<br/>
better.the deity you follow is your choice whatever choice<br/>
you choose. i play on veeshan and mithaniel marr<br/>
mostly my self but am thinking of trying a role play<br/>
server.i do also think that eq was all for role play but<br/>
am finding new stuff out all the time.personally i<br/>
usually choose agnostic because it&#39;s easier to raise<br/>
factions when agnostic and npc&#39;s dont automatically hate<br/>
you usually hope this helps good luck,and by the way<br/>
go to any of the eq sites and they will tell you the<br/>
pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of each race far as class is concerned</div>
