<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294198902">Generally speaking, whomever does the most DAMAGE<br/>
to the mob will get the exp for it. So if you want<br/>
to powerlevel your lower level friend, feel free to<br/>
ultra buff him/her and debuff the mob, it will not be<br/>
counted as damage towards the mob. (for exp purposes<br/>
anyhow) Great spells for this are Quickness, Drowsy, high<br/>
level Skin/Talisman/Daring series. Stuns help<br/>
too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, if you are a high level enchanter<br/>
helping out some random newbie to powerlevel, you could<br/>
do this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Quickness/Cloud/Beserker Strength<br/>
the newbie&lt;br&gt;2) Tashani/Languid<br/>
Pace/Disempower/Whirl/Flux the mob&lt;br&gt;3) after the newbie does over half<br/>
damage, blow the mob away using DD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the newbie<br/>
will get all the exp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try to avoid using DOTs.<br/>
They are not effective to cast at the end of a fight<br/>
obviously. And if you cast them at the beginning it is hard<br/>
to judge how much damage the mob has taken from the<br/>
newbie, and how much was from the DOT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heals are<br/>
another good way to help :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this<br/>
helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>
