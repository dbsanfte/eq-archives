  Subject: [The EverQuest Tavern] An Idea<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Hey Melefante, what&#39;s up?  Even tho my idea for an<br/>
  all mage guild didn&#39;t work.. I have a new idea =) <br/>
  Bazaar is going to be REOPENED in Freeport... how is<br/>
  this possible you ask?  Well, if we all take our<br/>
  business to FP, then we can open up a mini-bazaar of<br/>
  course for the time being, we won&#39;t have the niceities<br/>
  of AFk and such, but, with enough people there we can<br/>
  sell on the auction channel and just tell people we<br/>
  are in FP... the upside to FP is that ANYONE can go<br/>
  there. (short of certian evil people which may often<br/>
  use disguises to get in or just up faction)  The idea,<br/>
  is lead by example.. Start selling your goods in FP<br/>
  and others will come and do the same... if we start<br/>
  doing this on ALL the servers, verant might take and<br/>
  do something about it.. who knows, we might even have<br/>
  afk merchant abilities after a few months.... tell<br/>
  your friends ... tell your clients... tell the people<br/>
  who HATE luclin altogether, the bazaar is opening in<br/>
  FREEPORT and we SHALL succeed !!!! <br/>
<br/>
    talk to yall later,<br/>
