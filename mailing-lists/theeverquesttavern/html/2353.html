<div id="ygrps-yiv-527351134">Hi,&lt;br&gt;I got EverQuest for Christmas and am using<br/>
the Cazic-Thule Server, from a player who uses it and<br/>
have seen no down or lag time yet. Matter of fact my<br/>
computer got weird and threw me out, and I re-booted went<br/>
back on and everything I had was still there.&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
love EverQuest, I don&#39;t see why you left. Do you have<br/>
to start over now, or did you keep your<br/>
character?&lt;br&gt;If you ever get on this server, give me a<br/>
hail.&lt;br&gt;aka halfling druid---&quot;Darkemist&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Hope to see ya<br/>
there soon.&lt;br&gt;Happy 2002!!&lt;br&gt;Cat</div>
