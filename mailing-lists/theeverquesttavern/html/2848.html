<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948505463">I have a sucky dial up. Due to crap phone lines, I connect at 26400 <br/>
consistently. Doesn&#39;t matter what modem I use. The game plays okay on <br/>
my pIII 450 with 512 ram and a 64m vid card. It has some hiccups once <br/>
in a while and I have to turn everything off in the bazaar to be able <br/>
to have some control there. It&#39;s still laggy in the bazaar but I have <br/>
no probs.<br/>
<br/>
My second box is a p4 2.2g 512ram 128m vid card. It&#39;s also on the <br/>
same dial up (yes, only one at a time :( ) but I have NO lag with it. <br/>
I entered the bazaar and forgot to turn everything off (100 percent <br/>
clip plane emotes, animations etc) and I had less lag than I do with <br/>
the other box with all the options turned off.<br/>
<br/>
Dial up zones slower than dsl/cable but I have no issues with the <br/>
gameplay.<br/>
