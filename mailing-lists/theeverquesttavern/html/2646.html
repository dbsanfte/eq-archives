<b>Subject:</b> [The EverQuest Tavern] Re: How do you get married on evequest? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310057703">I don&#39;t know... lvl 13 seems like an aweful young age to get <br/>
married.  I mean, as a caster, you don&#39;t really have a lot of spells <br/>
yet, and your spell skills are low.  As a melee, well, there is just <br/>
so much to do and learn.  That&#39;s the time when you should be out <br/>
adventuring and sowing your wild oats, but now you have to worry <br/>
about your &quot;soulmate&quot; getting eaten by a bear or stepped on by a <br/>
giant??  And how are you going to feel if you pull a train down on <br/>
your wife and she bites the farm?  <br/>
<br/>
I saw wait until you&#39;re older.  Go out and make a (sur)name for <br/>
yourself, see distant lands.  If she lets you go and you return, it <br/>
was meant to be, right?  You hear it all the time-- young couple gets <br/>
married, but the realize they want different things.  He wants to <br/>
study Al&#39;Kabor&#39;s secrets in Erudin, while she wants to vanquish Hill <br/>
Giants for profit.  Long distance romances just don&#39;t work either, <br/>
even if one of you is a druid or wizard.  Best to wait &#39;till lvl 30 <br/>
at least.  Unless you&#39;re a halfling.  In that case, your life <br/>
expectancy is not very high, so you might as well breed like the mice <br/>
you are as soon as possible!!<br/>
<br/>
To do it right, you need to master jewelry making, and make your own <br/>
ring too. It means so much more.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;  But make sure a few times that the GM will be there.  They<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dont keep records of this stuff so petition and make sure that <br/>
&gt; the Gm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you are talking to can personally do the service.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t necessarily need a GM if the female character does not <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; a surname yet (pre-20 or by choice). However, you will if changes <br/>
&gt; need to be made.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After that it&#39;s entirely up to the player how their wedding <br/>
unfolds. <br/>
&gt; I did mine eons ago when I was around level 13 I believe. It was a <br/>
&gt; personal wedding, bride, myself, closest friends and a GM (who was <br/>
&gt; also a good friend) at Qeynos (we were fighting around their for XP <br/>
&gt; at the time). Two years later we renewed our vows at a neutral <br/>
zone, <br/>
&gt; Lake Rathe with the entire guild and drunk members proceeded to <br/>
&gt; destroy each other at the Arena afterwards for sh**s and giggles :) </span></blockquote></div>
