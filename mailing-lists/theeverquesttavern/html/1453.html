<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417871445">Hey all~~ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just hit lvl 18 and am<br/>
working hard to get to lvl 19 (druid here -- and can<br/>
already taste the port spells!!). I&#39;ve been wanting to<br/>
hit Kunark, but my travelling companion (a ranger)<br/>
says that it&#39;s too dangerous for our level. My<br/>
argument is that it seems like a HUGE continent, and there<br/>
HAS to be some zones where 2 lvl 19s can powerlevel,<br/>
adventure, get good loot and have fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any advice???<br/>
The draw of new Mobs and different types of items are<br/>
pulling at my wandering spirit, which is weary of bashing<br/>
beetles in NK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela (Orcbane)&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 18th<br/>
season&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>
