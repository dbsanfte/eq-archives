<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745690995">Geez people that think your chars are BORING! All<br/>
people do it seems is just Draw, Kill, Loot, Draw, Kill,<br/>
Loot, etc. It&#39;s much better to develop a piece of<br/>
yourself into the character you made and bring it to life.<br/>
What would be even greater is to bunch a few friends<br/>
together and bring up an epic quest. Heck even beg the<br/>
GM&#39;s to help you with a good quest. Half the fun of<br/>
everquest it to roleplay, the other half is up to you (ex:<br/>
helping newbies, pissing others off :P) stuff like that.</div>
