<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110439921">www.castersrealm.com has some pretty good info on<br/>
jewelry making that I&#39;ve used for my chanter. EITHER your<br/>
WIS or your INT matters in jewelry making, DEPEDING<br/>
on which is higher. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There should be no<br/>
difference in difficulty or in skill leveling when using<br/>
enchanted or unenchanted metals. In my experience, and i&#39;ve<br/>
read posts to this effect too, Jewelry making has the<br/>
best skill level increase per attempt ratio of all<br/>
trade skills. Generally, I would gain a skill level at<br/>
least every other attempt (sometimes every 3d or 4th<br/>
attempt, but sometimes 4 attempts in a row would give a<br/>
skill increase). Failure rate, well that&#39;s another<br/>
story-- though i usually only fail consistently when i&#39;m<br/>
trying to make items that have a trivial level 20 more<br/>
than my skill level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check the sites that show<br/>
average prices for selling jewlry items to see what the<br/>
market is and what you should be making. INT and WIS<br/>
rings sell great at lower levels-- I would make tons<br/>
and recoup all my costs PLUS some, by selling them<br/>
for 5pp (or more). The merchants would only pay me<br/>
1pp+ for them. BUT there were some rings that didn&#39;t<br/>
sell well to players (ie. 2AC +4svPoison), but sell to<br/>
merchants (5pp in this case). So you CAN make some money<br/>
back. Once your skill gets up, you can make a bunch of<br/>
money-- i started making WIS earrings-- good money. OH--<br/>
and make those STR, DEX or AGI rings-- melee guys<br/>
have tons of money to give you for them, because<br/>
they&#39;re not buying spells--haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mandir the<br/>
