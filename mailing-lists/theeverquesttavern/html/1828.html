<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273992962">Been reading up on a lot of different opinions<br/>
here. Will try to summarize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Snare isn&#39;t as<br/>
easy to get taunted off as the rest. Not if I do it<br/>
right away. If I wait for the taunters and damage<br/>
dealers to do a bit first... then....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s the<br/>
way to agro like you wouldn&#39;t believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the<br/>
tank runs up, snare the mob and DS the tank. Almost<br/>
always-- any adds and often the snared-- will run to you.<br/>
If you&#39;re pulling, snare and dot. By the time it<br/>
gets to your party-- it&#39;ll take ages to get the mob<br/>
off you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Healing is another great way to have<br/>
peels and also sitting. One trick I do is, first-- agro<br/>
like mad. Then when finally, it gets pulled off me...<br/>
I back up a tick away. Sit... med a tick. Mob&#39;s<br/>
almost reached me by then. I run away and sit in time to<br/>
catch the tick. (I count off... one one thousand, two<br/>
one thousand, three one thousand-- TICK/SIT). Catch<br/>
the tick for to refresh mana with efficiency--<br/>
rinse,wash,repeat. They&#39;ll chase you for about half their life -- if<br/>
you&#39;re not with a cleric/enchanter/bard/necro-- and<br/>
doing fear kiting. This is only for group kite-- mostly<br/>
if I&#39;m pulling or kiting adds. Rarely do I solo--<br/>
especially since my specialty is Alteration. I care little<br/>
for kiting-- BORING-- even with trying quad.<br/>
LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhoo-- person I&#39;m with is getting ready to go so I need<br/>
to hurry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Shaman rerinse issue. A lot of<br/>
the first 16 levels are gainable within a 24 hour<br/>
period of online time. Admittedly-- that&#39;s a long time--<br/>
almost three weeks of play for me-- but Three weeks<br/>
versus-- knowing your character and zone better, and etc.<br/>
That allows you to get a better feel for you<br/>
class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve restarted Druid 3 times and played numerous other<br/>
classes to level 10 or 12 just to get a feel for them.<br/>
Helps a lot for everything. I knew I wanted more<br/>
starting Wis but still liked the way I spread more points<br/>
around. I know my play style well and people love me in<br/>
groups usually-- I know what I&#39;m doing and it usually<br/>
(USUALLY) shows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you can tell my inexperience<br/>
when I play my bard. Getting better-- but the agro<br/>
factors still kill me. Juggling 3 songs causes more agro<br/>
than I would think and gotta be careful about the<br/>
balance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in other words-- sorry for the length-- It&#39;s up<br/>
to you. If you had fun with your shaman-- in the<br/>
long run, restarting might prove very, very rewarding.<br/>
I moved to another server on the last instance and<br/>
it really proved interesting. I also tried<br/>
restarting on a same server once. Also rewarding. In the<br/>
end, I&#39;d like to think I know as much as most druids<br/>
Level 36 and below and maybe some above-- on group<br/>
dynamics. Kiting is definately my weak point... but I can<br/>
live without kiting. It&#39;s great exp-- but<br/>
BORING.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic &lt;br&gt;Drinal server--<br/>
Tribunal of Antiquities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS ... heh... rambling<br/>
more than usual-- friend waiting</div>
