<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332076693">I play a shaman and a warrior and wanted to play<br/>
a caster. I stopped playing my wizard at level 6.<br/>
The feedback I&#39;d read from many experienced players,<br/>
made me realize that I would be really depressed if I<br/>
continued. So I&#39;ve started and Enchanter and am having a lot<br/>
of fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizards have DD, teleport, and<br/>
root.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizard DD is about 5-15% more effective than mages and<br/>
druids and those classes have features that more than<br/>
outweigh this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are playing a class that can<br/>
teleport and nuke, Druid is soooooo much more versatile,<br/>
they can heal for example. If you just like to nuke, a<br/>
mage pet is a handy thing to have around. If you like<br/>
to solo, play a necro or a mage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The class is<br/>
not broken and can bring value to a group, but<br/>
Wizzies are not a required class. I would much rather<br/>
play a cleric for example. Boring, maybe, but very<br/>
much needed by other players. Wizards have no role<br/>
that cannot be filled by other classed, other than<br/>
Alter Plane Hate. Bottom line is there is still a huge<br/>
&#39;suck factor&#39; that needs to be addressed.</div>
