<div id="ygrps-yiv-268068609">Been working hard on trade skills but reading up<br/>
on Fletching. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most articles say you can&#39;t<br/>
get above 100 fletching IF you&#39;ve got another Trade<br/>
skill&lt;br&gt;above 100. Are there other trade skills like&lt;br&gt;this?<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Fletching is the only one, I&#39;ll go and try to<br/>
stop all other trade skills before I get that high<br/>
(fat chance other than Fishing-- but that luckily is<br/>
one of the few trade skills I&#39;ve seen that get capped<br/>
by level). That way I can go over&lt;br&gt;100 and not<br/>
have that limit for Fletching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it&#39;s the case<br/>
for all other trade skills, I have to decide which<br/>
trade skill I want over 100.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
