<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620179246">Well said! It&#39;s fun either way...but I agree,<br/>
stop begging! ;) I heard of a friend that got sick of<br/>
a begger wanting a teleport...so he teleported him<br/>
to some REALLY hard zone and then gated<br/>
out...hopefully taught the begger a lesson! ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did want<br/>
to say thanks to all the players out there who help<br/>
out...even when not asking for it...like when I&#39;m getting<br/>
pounded by mobs/trains, they heal me up on their way<br/>
through the zone...really nice to see that!<br/>
:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take care and happy hunting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jim&lt;br&gt;CoJim,<br/>
