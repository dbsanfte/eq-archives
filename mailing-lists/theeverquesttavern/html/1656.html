<div id="ygrps-yiv-651167709">There&#39;s not usually any problem at the TP ring in<br/>
Dreadlands, its the getting to anywhere else from that point<br/>
that hard. The NEVER should be paired with either of<br/>
the Iceclad Ocean rings. Two words: snow dervishes.<br/>
Grubby little bastards that are always around the rings,<br/>
and usually jump those people just zoning in. As<br/>
advice, take the boat from North Ro until you can<br/>
teleport to at least the Eastern Wastes. (I am pretty sure<br/>
there&#39;s something you have to pick up from the rings<br/>
before you can actually fly there in<br/>
Velious).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf</div>
