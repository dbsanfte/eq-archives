<div id="ygrps-yiv-888561701">I think with the holiday season, we saw a lot<br/>
more new players get the game. On Sullon Zek (of all<br/>
places), I met three people who had just started playing.<br/>
Has made for some very unruly groups . . . which<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be so bad, but folks don&#39;t seem very good at<br/>
listening and/or learning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My pet peeve the other<br/>
night was the assist command. I tried to explain it to<br/>
the young ranger who kept attacking a different MOb,<br/>
but I don&#39;t think he got it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
