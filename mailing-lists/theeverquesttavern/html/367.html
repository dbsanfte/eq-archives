<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894621478">Thank YOU for the great times, Gil! You have<br/>
always been a helpful guy and great fun to have around,<br/>
and you wouldn&#39;t get frustrated with 100s of newbie<br/>
questions ;) We&#39;ll all miss you a lot, but hopefully you<br/>
can come by and post up here about how things are<br/>
going, it would still be great to hear from you despite<br/>
your Norrathian Deprivation =( Good luck in the future<br/>
and hopefully you will return someday!</div>
