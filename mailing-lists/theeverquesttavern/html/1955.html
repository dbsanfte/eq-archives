<div id="ygrps-yiv-216396144">Here&#39;s a good tip -- don&#39;t follow the roads<br/>
through Lfay to Steamfont. When you zone in and are about<br/>
to leave the tunnel, align yourself with the wall on<br/>
the left. Just go straight at the same angle as that<br/>
wall, run for about 45 seconds, and you&#39;ll see the<br/>
Gnome huts with some weird equipment and robots<br/>
standing around. Just beyond that is the tunnel leading to<br/>
Steamfont.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then follow the path -- go right at the first<br/>
crossroads, left at the second, I think. A right turn at the<br/>
second takes you to some Kobold camps that might be good<br/>
hunting for your level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, I would<br/>
go to Butcherblock instead of Steamfont. Much easier<br/>
to get to, more guards around, better<br/>
