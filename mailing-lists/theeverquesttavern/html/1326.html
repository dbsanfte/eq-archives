<b>Subject:</b> Rant on Solo vs Group (VERY LONG) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752468876">Why are people always posting on other sites<br/>
about how &quot;blah&quot; solo blah blah solo?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love<br/>
Druids. And of course people always tell me &quot;of course&quot;.<br/>
They&#39;re easy to play, over powered, etc. But I HATE<br/>
soloing and practically never do so. I could if I needed<br/>
to but often run around an hour waiting for a group<br/>
rather than fully soloing (although I will solo while<br/>
waiting for the group when I have ppl telling me that<br/>
they&#39;ll send me a tell when there&#39;s space in their<br/>
group).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do people solo? Sorry if I seem annoyed but part<br/>
of the whole repeated point beat into me by now by<br/>
many a Sony/EQ post is that EQ is a GROUP game. (I<br/>
really want to find out how the Best in Strategy-- 7 on<br/>
7 group combat works out. I LOVE that<br/>
idea).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hear people complain about things like -- my<br/>
Cleric can&#39;t survive and get from place to place or my<br/>
Wizard just isn&#39;t as great a nuker as I&#39;d hoped and I<br/>
get confused.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure Clerics can&#39;t solo but<br/>
here&#39;s a good example of their power. At level 20,<br/>
myself and another 21 shaman and a rogue cannot take out<br/>
an Avocet Aviak. No way. Myself, a Shaman, and<br/>
Cleric do it with a fight and full mana. Add any melee<br/>
and it&#39;s DARNED easy. Shaman buffs melee, I Damage<br/>
Shield, and then we two rush in and help melee (dropping<br/>
back for the occasional heal assist). Bam... the thing<br/>
drops down. Easy kill as long as no adds greater than<br/>
darter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Group of four 20, 21 lvls without a Cleric might as<br/>
well forget it. And then Wizzies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Different<br/>
use. Faster kills, for less damage. But they complain<br/>
about agro factor. Don&#39;t nuke as much. The way I time<br/>
my nukes (when nuker) is I blast when warrior&#39;s done<br/>
that much damage or close or it&#39;s starting to run and<br/>
not snared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry to rant. Just this whole<br/>
obsession with Solo seems strange to me. Don&#39;t play Cleric<br/>
if you want to solo. Healers can heal themselves but<br/>
most healers are supposed to heal others. Don&#39;t play<br/>
Enchanters if you don&#39;t like crowd control/debuff/mana<br/>
crack. LOL. Etc. etc. etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman/namoohs out<br/>
(Fatedhue of Drinal)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... sorry for the rant. I<br/>
just have to vent sometimes. I agree groups are not<br/>
the end all and be all. Just realize that classes all<br/>
have different paths of power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Druid--<br/>
traveller/handy man; Enchanter-- Crack, Jewelry, Debuffs, buffs;<br/>
Magicians-- summoner, pets; Shaman-- buffer/handy man;<br/>
Wizards-- mobs fall fast; Rogue-- Backstab, Evade, Dodger;<br/>
Warriors-- Tanks, Damage; Monk-- FAASSST damage; Etc etc<br/>
etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Point of story. A good group always<br/>
rocks. I laugh, I joke, and I kill. And the loot is<br/>
almost always great. Best group I was ever in-- Warrior,<br/>
Enchanter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizzie, and Myself. Exp bonus and<br/>
little DT hunting Aviaks. =)Mana regen&#39;d fast, Things<br/>
went down hard. 2 healers, a Tank, mana/debuff,<br/>
backstab and blast. Plus snare to keep their backs turned<br/>
so we could sit and med while tank wacked and rogue<br/>
repeat backstabbed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry once more for ranting.<br/>
But groups can be the most fustrating thing in EQ AND<br/>
the best darned time I&#39;ve EVER had. Only reason I<br/>
keep coming back. It&#39;s a chat and a kill fest all in<br/>
one.</div>
