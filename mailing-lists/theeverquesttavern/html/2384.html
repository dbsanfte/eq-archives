<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492170173">How&#39;s it going everyone?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A totally<br/>
weightless container would weight nothing and be 100% weight<br/>
reduction. I think that the only bags that qualify are the<br/>
summoned bags that a Mage or a Shamen can make. Not sure<br/>
about the Shammy bag, but the Mage one is 100% weight<br/>
reduction, 0 weight, 4 slot and can fit HUGE things in it--<br/>
but, it is no rent and disappears (along with anything<br/>
inside it) within 30 mins after you log off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela<br/>
