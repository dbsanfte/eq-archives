<div id="ygrps-yiv-59345190">There is no need to be rude, we are here to help<br/>
people, not become rude....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creating Guilds<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you decide that none of the existing guilds are<br/>
quite what you are looking for, you may found your own<br/>
guild. In order to establish your guild you must have an<br/>
acceptable name, charter, and a membership of 10 players who<br/>
wish to form this guild. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following process<br/>
needs to be followed to gain approval for you<br/>
guild:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The person who is to be the leader of the guild must<br/>
enter the chat server and issue the #makeguild command.<br/>
This will create a private guild channel. The name of<br/>
the guild should be used as the name of the channel,<br/>
although this name can be edited later during the creation<br/>
process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the channel has been created, the guild leader<br/>
needs to invite the members of his guild into the<br/>
channel. To do this he needs to tell the guild members the<br/>
name of the channel and the password for<br/>
access.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once a total of 10 members are in the channel and have<br/>
issued the #guildapprove command, the guild leader can<br/>
then issue the #makeguild command. This will move the<br/>
guild leader to the guild creation screen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In<br/>
the guild creation screen, the guild leader needs to<br/>
enter a summary of the guild∩┐╜s charter. This summary<br/>
should focus on the guild∩┐╜s role in Norrath and the<br/>
goals it will pursue. Details of the internal working<br/>
of your guild need not be included. You may also<br/>
edit your guild∩┐╜s name in this screen. Once completed,<br/>
hit FINISH and the guild will be submitted for<br/>
approval.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The leader of the guild may check the status of the<br/>
guild by activating the GUILDS button from chat. If the<br/>
status of the guild indicates a need for revision, the<br/>
guild leader should select his guild and hit the EDIT<br/>
button. Comments regarding the nature of the needed<br/>
revision appear at the bottom of the guild creation<br/>
screen. The guild leader can edit the charter and the<br/>
guild name as needed and hit the FINISH button to<br/>
resubmit the guild for approval. IMPORTANT: If the leader<br/>
is only viewing the revisions needed, hit CANCEL to<br/>
exit this screen. If the leader hits FINISH the guild<br/>
will be resubmitted for approval and the leader will<br/>
be unable to re-enter the guild creation/edit<br/>
screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the name and charter have been approved, the<br/>
guild leader will be notified via email that the guild<br/>
is ready to be created. Please verify that your<br/>
email is correct in our files by going to<br/>
account:change account:edit registration from the login<br/>
screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the guild leader has received notification that<br/>
the guild has been approved, it is his responsibility<br/>
to petition and meet the GM of his server between<br/>
2pm and 11pm P.S.T. to complete the guild creation<br/>
process.</div>
