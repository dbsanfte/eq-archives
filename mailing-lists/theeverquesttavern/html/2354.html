<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-200513360">Well, it&#39;s been a month now since SOL has been<br/>
released and I have not yet been able to play it. After 50<br/>
minutes on hold waiting to talk to the tech reps and<br/>
numerous emails, I am no closer of getting the problem<br/>
fixed as I was before. When I go into EQ it is fine<br/>
through the server select screen, but when it goes to<br/>
loading the game I get the left side of the screen<br/>
overlapping onto about 1/4 of the right side. Tech support<br/>
says update your video driver, I have to no<br/>
avail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am very frustrated and hoping that someone may<br/>
have a suggestion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for taking the time<br/>
to read this<br/>
post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dave&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;aka&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizzkid 51 wizard&lt;br&gt;Reptilious 34 shammy&lt;br&gt;and 5<br/>
