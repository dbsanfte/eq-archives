<div id="ygrps-yiv-311592429">Yesterday I finaly found,thanks to a fellow<br/>
friend on the game, what I was supposed to tell to<br/>
Raska. Sorry but it was my first quest. :) Although im<br/>
11 lvl (not much but getting there), I had the worse<br/>
armor and the worse skill choice, etc. etc. Yesterday I<br/>
read allot about the skills and the restrictions of<br/>
being a monk and all of it. NOW I know what I was doing<br/>
wrong... Yesterday too I did all the shackle stuff till<br/>
the stone one... Which is good... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On one of<br/>
the Guides, Documents, or Whatever I read Yesterday,<br/>
they say that the Fists will be allways better because<br/>
of the weight restriction, that two good weapons<br/>
will allways weight a lot. Is this true?<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another thing, I didn&#39;t knew that I had Dodge, so i<br/>
didn&#39;t invested anything on it, so it seems that i&#39;m not<br/>
using it, but I already spent all my skill points<br/>
(obviously on the incorrect places :) ) Is there a way of<br/>
training the Dodge thing without skill points, or i have<br/>
to lvl...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks</div>
