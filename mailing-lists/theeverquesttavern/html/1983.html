<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658096409">The PS2 will support a connection other than<br/>
a&lt;br&gt;phone line. It will connect as fast if not faster<br/>
than&lt;br&gt;your computer. You don&#39;t have to worry about your<br/>
Hard&lt;br&gt;Drive crashing or some other nasty computer<br/>
problem&lt;br&gt;with the PS2. It has a GREAT video graphis<br/>
support,&lt;br&gt;AND it playes DVDs without a seperate CD-ROM<br/>
drive.&lt;br&gt;The computer has its advantages also but it will<br/>
put&lt;br&gt;a HUGE dent in your wallet compared to the PS2.<br/>
My&lt;br&gt;opinion is to get the PS2. Besides Computers are<br/>
outdated&lt;br&gt;every 30 seconds, but with the PS2 you&#39;re sure it<br/>
will&lt;br&gt;be up to date for years (until PS3).</div>
