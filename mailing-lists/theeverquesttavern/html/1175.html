<div id="ygrps-yiv-295274485">Well i am pretty sure im kos any where that drops<br/>
decent loot so i can wait. I made 25 and didnt feel like<br/>
going back to the treans, so i am soloing ec guards.<br/>
They have pretty good exp(especially for a troll SK,<br/>
bout 1/5 bub a kill)and they drop, pretty good<br/>
loot(3-5pp most of the time + FS weapons, have had the<br/>
occasional few silver but i also had a treant drop 13 copper<br/>
once so i guess nohing is consistant). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thx for<br/>
the help, &lt;br&gt;Cireno De&#39;Tenebrae&lt;br&gt;House<br/>
