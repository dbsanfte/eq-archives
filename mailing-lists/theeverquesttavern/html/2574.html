<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479387565">Hey all. I got 14 days left till I move on campus. Awesome huh? <br/>
Anyway, started going about getting the stuff to up-grade my comp. I <br/>
have the sound card, and SOL, so now all&#39;s I need is the vid card and <br/>
some memory. I asked my cousin (he&#39;s a comp wiz. works for Compac <br/>
too) and he gave me the names of some stores that I can bug here in <br/>
Houston. Soooo...I figure end of next month? I should be playing <br/>
again. Ok so here is the question I have for up-grading the comp. <br/>
Will just the mem, vid and sound up-grade be enough if I have a pen <br/>
2? (at this time I can only afford to up-grade that stuff versus a <br/>
whole new mother board.) The Raven P.S. I&#39;m thinking Rayvin for a <br/>
name. Sound ok?</div>
