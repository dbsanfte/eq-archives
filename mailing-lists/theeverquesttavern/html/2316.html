<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070681533">The poor man&#39;s route is sometimes the best. Many<br/>
of the items made in the trade skills find no buyer.<br/>
My thoughts are to minimize my losses. My Vah Shir<br/>
Bard (who was level 7 at the time) spent 17pp and went<br/>
from a 2 in pottery to 108 in less than two hours<br/>
(mainly due to clay being not stackable) I had to run<br/>
back and forth from the supplier to the pottery wheel<br/>
but it was fun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I made med jars until trivial<br/>
(36) and then I switched to med bowls which trivial at<br/>
122. I quit before I got that far because my hands<br/>
where getting tired from all the clicking.<br/>
