<div id="ygrps-yiv-34551326">They can deal massive amounts of damage and have<br/>
a built in Haste ability that kicks in at high<br/>
levels. They have the Block skill. (one more &quot;dodge like&quot;<br/>
skill) They can Feign Death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those are just a few<br/>
of the points. But I&#39;d wait for the expansion so you<br/>
don&#39;t have to be Human. Humans have no night vision and<br/>
have &quot;well rounded&quot; stats, which in EQ is a BAD thing.<br/>
EQ is geared towards polarization. You got a melee<br/>
class - pump the melee stats, caster - pump the mana<br/>
stat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just some opinions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on<br/>
