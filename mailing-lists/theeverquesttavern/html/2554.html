<div id="ygrps-yiv-489838334">Question? I was just looking at some of the pics and I saw one that <br/>
said screen shots. How do you do those and where are they saved on <br/>
your comp? (I do remember them from when I did play I just never took <br/>
any.) The Raven <br/>

P.S. Still waiting on word about housing....I think I&#39;ll go bug them <br/>
Monday after Bio and Soc. At least I did give them a few days before <br/>
I start to bug them!</div>
