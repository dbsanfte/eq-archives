<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633729463">Ok, when I said I had mostly leather, I meant the<br/>
look. I actually am only wearing legs and shoes that<br/>
are truly leather (banded actually... I&#39;m a tailor<br/>
and made them myself).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot of my wisdom<br/>
items were givien to me by some friends who like to<br/>
hang out at the EC tunnel, and they do pretty well<br/>
there. Not my cup of tea tho. I&#39;m not up on how much<br/>
stuff goes for, but you can check it on<br/>
&lt;a href=http://www.eqprices.com target=new&gt;http://www.eqprices.com&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve found them to be pretty<br/>
accurate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a black medallion (not the exact name... like I<br/>
said, I&#39;m NOT a equipment junkie) that you should be<br/>
able to get. If you can find a jeweler, jasper is our<br/>
gem of choice... that&#39;s the one that increases<br/>
wisdom. If you show up with a silver bar and a jasper,<br/>
most jewelers will give you a heavy discount, maybe<br/>
even free. Just remember fizzles happen, and you might<br/>
lose it if he fizzles.</div>
