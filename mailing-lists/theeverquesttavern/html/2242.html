<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-369544318">Thank you for the info, but the problems this<br/>
time may be with the server.I saw a desperate posting<br/>
on nother board about Mithasniel Marr last night.<br/>
After I sitched servers (and made up still another<br/>
character on Veeshan), I did not have the problems. &lt;br&gt;<br/>
Did I read last night tha you will need at least<br/>
256Megs to run Luclin and 512 to run it properly? Wow.Wht<br/>
a boom for the memory addicts to sell all of that<br/>
memory to EQ addicts,lol. On the other habd, it is about<br/>
time someone was brave enough to do this.&lt;br&gt; I am too<br/>
well into UO to ever give it up. There are things I<br/>
prefer in both games.At this time, of course, I am much<br/>
more comfortable with UO, but I am trying to learn EQ.<br/>
I bought the strategy guide (the big one)and am<br/>
trying to read in that as well as the book that came<br/>
with my game.In fact I read myself to sleep last<br/>
night.</div>
