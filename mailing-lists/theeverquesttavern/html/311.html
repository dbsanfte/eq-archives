<div id="ygrps-yiv-147808887">I was about the same way. I had started a new<br/>
job, and some friends here were talking about it.<br/>
Sounded fun, so I checked out some stuff. Decided I<br/>
wanted it. Got up the money to buy it, then went<br/>
installed it, and turned out my credit card was maxed, so<br/>
finally two weeks later I was actually able to play. Was<br/>
very restless, looking up everything I could about it.<br/>
Before I actually started it, I knew what class I would<br/>
play.</div>
