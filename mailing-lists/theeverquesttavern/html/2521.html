<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006770152">Actually, that was true until about-- I would say<br/>
9 months to a year ago. I think a few months after<br/>
Velious when player # ramped a bit. I&#39;m trying to<br/>
remember but can&#39;t. Not very good with time and history<br/>
sometimes. (Temporally and Spacially<br/>
challenged)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway. I&#39;ve had a few friends that lapsed OR wanted to<br/>
go to the Card so cancelled their card on the<br/>
account a weee bit too early (thinking that of course--<br/>
three months was just the high end). Well nasty<br/>
surprised awaited when they came back 3+ months later and<br/>
their level 57 druid or what not was wiped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
would say now-- they do it fairly regularly. Not sure<br/>
HOW regularly but probably at least 9 out of 10<br/>
times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
