<div id="ygrps-yiv-80948996">I am a 36 Wizzy on the Xegony server and from<br/>
experience I can say that Dreadlands is a fairly safe<br/>
teleport. In the half dozen or so times I have teleported<br/>
there I have yet to even see an enemy, plus there are<br/>
normally people standing around that keep the area clear<br/>
of wandering beasts. On the other hand, when you<br/>
teleport to Cazic there is a good chance you will be<br/>
attacked upon arrival, and I am told the same holds true<br/>
for Iceclad. I have teleported 3 times to Iceclad and<br/>
one time saw an enemy, so I don&#39;t know really how<br/>
safe it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as fees go, I teleport for<br/>
donations and have received as little as nothing for corpse<br/>
retrivals up to 100pp, so I feel donations work really<br/>
well. I probably average about 25pp per<br/>
shot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safe Journeys my friends and look me up if you are on<br/>
the Xegony server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizzkid, 36th year&lt;br&gt;Grim<br/>
