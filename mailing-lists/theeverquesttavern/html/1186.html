<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-947609074">When I first started-- I decided I wanted to read<br/>
ALL the posts listed. I have now finished that quest.<br/>
=) Course when one has to work at 6am and you answer<br/>
like 2 calls in first two hours before it picks up--<br/>
One has a lot of time to read posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as<br/>
EQ-- still a lowly 4th lvl Druid. But having lotsa<br/>
fun. Helped a guild get formed yesterday. Hoping it<br/>
does well. It&#39;s a bunch of ppl from work. But it&#39;s<br/>
definately an interesting bunch. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of it&#39;s<br/>
primary rules was &quot;no twinking&quot;. I protested to that as I<br/>
was an advocate of twinking. There after-- I found<br/>
out that my definition of twinking is different than<br/>
guild&#39;s def. I guess everyone thinks of twinking as a<br/>
different thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think of twinking as decking out<br/>
your new character or level 4 character with a magic<br/>
weapon (like a druid equivalent of 1h silvery axe would<br/>
be twinking to me). Or giving your character full<br/>
Banded/bronze (silk if you&#39;re a monk). Or giving your character<br/>
100 plat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m curious what ppl define as<br/>
Twinking. Is what I defined here &quot;twinking&quot; to<br/>
others?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m asking b/c I couldn&#39;t see how skills would suffer<br/>
from this and now I see. I&#39;m a big believer in upping<br/>
skills. I&#39;ve also discovered from friends that my plan of<br/>
making money with the Monk is a bad plan. Which is why<br/>
I&#39;m going back to druid. Following my GM&#39;s<br/>
instructions on the slow but sure way to gain money for<br/>
spells. And using my monk for future plans of a character<br/>
with Master levels of all trade skills. Grin.<br/>
=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK... I&#39;ve rambled on enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out...<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FatedHue- WE Druid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... feel free to comment on any<br/>
portion of post. The Twinking, the Monk&#39;s being bad at<br/>
earning money, the reading of posts-- heck even the PS if<br/>
ya want. Once more. I apologize for writing so much.</div>
