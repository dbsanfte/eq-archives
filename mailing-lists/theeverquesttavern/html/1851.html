<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831677999">1) Heh, actually... I&#39;m terrible about knowing<br/>
zones and quests. I -- however-- know a lot about group<br/>
dynamic. For the most part, I group with anyone well.<br/>
Although chanters and bards increase my effectiveness 10<br/>
fold. At level 30-- had a bard and chanter in my group.<br/>
I was the only healer (there was a paly but he was<br/>
too busy to heal-- puller and all). I healed, DS, and<br/>
buffed without any problems with only a 128 wisdom. I<br/>
was in Skyshrine. Easy exp for me. Chanter mezzed<br/>
adds-- me and bard slowed runners. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) I do need<br/>
more experience in knowing my zones though. I always<br/>
get lost. =-) I&#39;m too used to being able to gate out<br/>
of problems now. LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) There are always<br/>
people bickering and stuff. But that happens. Everyone<br/>
has bad days. I try to empathize. Perspective is<br/>
everything. Sometimes-- yeah... you&#39;ve got rude ppl. But a<br/>
lot of times, it&#39;s just perspective and maybe<br/>
someone&#39;s having a bad day or wasn&#39;t thinking when they<br/>
said something. Goodness knows I&#39;ve done that.<br/>
=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Dang, between being sick, school, and work... EQ<br/>
dang it... not enough time for it. LOL. That and doing<br/>
VLARP, and sheesh. Anyhoo.... (darned bronchitis. Still<br/>
not sure if I should even attempt going to work and<br/>
to speak on the phone. Telephone tech support stinks<br/>
when having Bronchial issues)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone be well<br/>
and enjoy the game! It&#39;s still a ton of fun and<br/>
Lucian&#39;s a few months away. Whoo. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
