<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769099501">Yep. That&#39;s pretty much how it&#39;s unfolding across<br/>
the multiverse! Eqestreille becomes corrupted,<br/>
blighted mares show up in Lfay. Undead sprites (including<br/>
horrors and guards and guardians) fly all over. Beware<br/>
the Horrors, they are very agressive and harm touch<br/>
for 171. But they sometimes proc rejuvenate during<br/>
combat which fully heals you and restores mana. Wild the<br/>
first time it happens! Good loot, lots of no drop lore<br/>
including a piercer usable by all races and classes even if<br/>
you do noy have the skill!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went from 25 to<br/>
26 in just a couple of hours there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye<br/>
