<b>Subject:</b> Re: Guild Wars? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-44191398">Heh.. I&#39;ve only seen one guild war before... and<br/>
that was when I was playing on the Veeshan server. It<br/>
was one of the best things I&#39;ve ever had the<br/>
priviledge of witnessing. I don&#39;t know which guilds but<br/>
man... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sparkling Bard spells, ppl running like<br/>
mad men around all over. It must have lasted at least<br/>
30 mins. I don&#39;t know if I ever saw a corpse though.<br/>
But man was there a TON of magic being flashed. It<br/>
took place in East Commons and spanned the whole zone.<br/>
Big announcements about when it started and ended.<br/>
Ppl that walked into the zone asked what the heck was<br/>
going on as ppl zipped around as if PVP. LOL! I loved<br/>
it. It was sweet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One guild I&#39;d love to see in<br/>
a Guild war is the Mithril WarHammers.<br/>
Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know of a similar matching Guild. The<br/>
Miths are pretty large. Everywhere I go I see a couple<br/>
of them. That&#39;s why I think it&#39;d be a good guild<br/>
war. Eh well.. I&#39;m just being rabling now.<br/>
