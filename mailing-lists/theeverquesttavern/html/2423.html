<div id="ygrps-yiv-723179990">As a follow up-- I&#39;ve recently read that Verant<br/>
can not allow us to stack things with charges.<br/>
Therefore, in the near future at least, things like poisons<br/>
and caster spells will not stack. My question is<br/>
then, who are shammys able to stack potions??? Aren&#39;t<br/>
they items with charges???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for poison<br/>
components-- they are much more difficult and spread out than<br/>
spell research components. I have played a mage and a<br/>
chanter, and have known that I could spend some time in a<br/>
certain place (unrest, Oasis, etc) to get a good amount<br/>
of the words/pages i need for various level spells.<br/>
And I was always able to group in rather populated<br/>
zones to get the items. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rogues, on the other<br/>
hand, need to go to some out of the way places to get<br/>
some of the components. (Not many people hanging out<br/>
in lavastorm killing imps, drakes and basalisks).<br/>
The only consolation is that some components can be<br/>
bought, BUT the different vendors are quite spread out--<br/>
the most important one being in the middle of nowhere<br/>
in WK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had a 23 rogue who was pretty good a<br/>
poison making, but turned away from the server he was on<br/>
to be with friends. I&#39;ve since started over with a<br/>
rogue (one of my favorite classes), and am on my way to<br/>
poison level. Can&#39;t wait to start mass producing blind,<br/>
snare, root, DD, DOT and other<br/>
poisons!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rumbl&lt;br&gt;18th level rogue&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>
