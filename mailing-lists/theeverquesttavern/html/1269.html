<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066911010">Ooops! Nope. Sorry. Patchwork, yes. Banded and<br/>
bronze, no. You&#39;re a druid. Get used to the newbie look,<br/>
you&#39;re going to have it for a VERY long time. I&#39;m a<br/>
level 30 wood elf druid, and I&#39;m wearing leather. Now,<br/>
granted, I have collected as much wisdom-enhancing items<br/>
as I can get my grubbly little mitts on, but druids<br/>
cannot wear anything much past leather. Later on,<br/>
Ulthork and Tizmak armor, as well as brown chitlin are<br/>
available, but unless you have someone helping you, you<br/>
won&#39;t be seeing these until you&#39;re well into your<br/>
30&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My advice is to take up tailoring. Do it now. As a<br/>
level 4, you can make your own patchwork for some<br/>
silver, and sell it for some gold. And you can make your<br/>
own armor. Make friends with someone who smiths, and<br/>
someone who brews. You&#39;ll need items from them, and they<br/>
will need items from you. Later on, you can make<br/>
studded (which is better than leather) then reinforced.<br/>
Eventually, cultural wood elf armor. Also, you can forage.<br/>
Keep that skill maxed out. What I do is everytime I<br/>
sit to med, I hit the forage key first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far<br/>
as newbie quests, there isn&#39;t much that&#39;s<br/>
druid-specific. You can turn in those swords, but I found that<br/>
disappointing. Plus, at your level they&#39;re hard to find. Do the<br/>
mail quest. Kill wolves... yes, yes, I know, wolves<br/>
are friends of druids, but you&#39;ll be USING the pelts.<br/>
If you get a black wolf skin, turn it into the<br/>
enchanter guild at Felwithe. Collect bone chips. Do NOT<br/>
turn them in, sell them to players for about 3pp per<br/>
stack. Same thing with bat wings. Keep a stack or two<br/>
for yourself, you&#39;ll need it later on. Collect<br/>
spiderling silks, and make silk thread OR turn them into the<br/>
bard guild four at a time. If you don&#39;t mind the<br/>
travel, deliver mail from Ak&#39;Anon to Kelethin... the pay<br/>
is pretty good. Couple of plat, if I remember<br/>
correctly. And remember, loot EVERYTHING! Begging from NPC&#39;s<br/>
is iffy, and begging players is rude. Higher ups<br/>
will help someone who isn&#39;t asking, but is out there<br/>
whacking away for all their worth with a rusty sword and<br/>
tattered armor. I personally have been getting fine steel<br/>
weapons as drops regularly, and go to Orc hill and give<br/>
them all away to folks who don&#39;t ask, and aren&#39;t<br/>
twinked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck, I have found playing a druid to be quite<br/>
rewarding. And remember... once you hit 29 and can do<br/>
teleports, you&#39;ll NEVER be poor again. Just remember to do<br/>
some for free too. You&#39;re a druid. Karma is<br/>
important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fandarian&lt;br&gt;30th Druid, E&#39;ci</div>
