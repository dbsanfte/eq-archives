<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-487130836">A few questions. Is it the same as Highkeep, or<br/>
is Highkeep nonexistent? And, where the heck is<br/>
Highpass anyway? Someone told me between Qeynos and<br/>
Freeport. I have a lv 10 warrior in Qeynos and am looking<br/>
for the next town to go to - can anyone give me<br/>
directions?</div>
