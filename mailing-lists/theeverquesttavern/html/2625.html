<div id="ygrps-yiv-727846915">I forgot to add this in my answer. I have 1 SDRAM chip in right now. <br/>
I have four other slots that are being used by some older mem chips. <br/>
Tha is why I have 224? MB RAM. I am going to be buying another 128 <br/>
SDRAM chip in the next few weeks, but I can&#39; afford it right now. (I <br/>
think the store charged me $70.00? Maybe less, I can&#39;t remember.) I <br/>
do know that when I click on my EQ icon and download all the files <br/>
and I go to play it says that no 3D device was detected. I thought <br/>
that was the vid card so that was why I bought the new one. I don&#39;t <br/>
understand why my motherboard won&#39;t support it as I just bought a vid <br/>
card not five months ago when my old one died. (This one was a PCI. <br/>
The new one I bought is an AGP.) Thanks. The Raven</div>
