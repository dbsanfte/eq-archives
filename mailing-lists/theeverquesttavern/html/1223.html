<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-207729620">I was wondering if anyone else was having trouble<br/>
getting the command /camp desktop to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also<br/>
wondering about /changefontsize (or whatever the command<br/>
is. I haven&#39;t tried it yet. Does that work? Or is it<br/>
working as well as /camp desktop?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assuming of<br/>
course that everyone else&#39;s /camp desktop works as well<br/>
as mine-- which apparently is not at all. We all<br/>
know how well assuming works though. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out</div>
