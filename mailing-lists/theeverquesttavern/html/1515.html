<b>Subject:</b> Do you WANT to be a twink?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-131693525">That last post reminds me of a discussion I<br/>
frequently get in re: twinking. EQ is a game that&#39;s fun at<br/>
all levels, so I never understand why people are in<br/>
such a hurry to get stuff that they&#39;ll get at higher<br/>
levels. Must be Yak envy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why not go out into<br/>
GFay and bash evil decaying skellys, vile bats,<br/>
swarming drones, and wretched orc pawns in your first<br/>
years? It will fill you with pride to know that each<br/>
purchase you make is based solely on your own abilities<br/>
and experiences, and not the handouts of others. My<br/>
new Iksar Necro char ran out into LOIO with nothing<br/>
but a dagger, 2 spells, and delusions of granduer,<br/>
attacking fierce sabertooth kittys (and often running away)<br/>
until lvl 3. At that point, I felt worthy enough to go<br/>
back to my guild and seek further knowledge. Bought a<br/>
few spells (not all, knowing I would be back in<br/>
another season to be invited into the 2nd circle of dark<br/>
bindings) and headed out again for adventure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even<br/>
if you don&#39;t roleplay, though, I think it&#39;s good to<br/>
pay your dues at lower levels. At lvl 1, you don&#39;t<br/>
need to be twinked (I don&#39;t think you do at any<br/>
level-- UNLESS EQ is all about keeping up with the<br/>
Joneses). A Cleric in GFay will earn his way into many<br/>
groups on orc hill and then in CB in time. The loot you<br/>
can make yourself in CB will be staggering if you&#39;re<br/>
a good player and keep your group alive.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK-- that&#39;s my rant for the day-- haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
