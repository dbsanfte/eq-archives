<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154783218">In the defence of the game,  Ben Stien was responsible<br/>
for his son playing this game in the first place.  In<br/>
the opening game sequence in agreeing to the contract,<br/>
a person must be of lawful age or have the consent of<br/>
a parent or legal guardian.  Unless of course, his<br/>
father didn&#39;t know, then his son was pursuing illegal<br/>
activities. <br/>
<br/>
 And, about his solution.  Sending his son to boarding<br/>
school.... LMAO  don&#39;t take the kid away from video<br/>
games, take video games away from the kid.  I mean<br/>
SERIOUSLY.  Any child that would not abide by the<br/>
house rules isn&#39;t too well raised anyway.. he says he<br/>
heard his son playing in the middle of the night... he<br/>
shoulda picked his kid up by the collar and beat the<br/>
ever lovin %^*$ out of him.... I gaurantee, he would<br/>
reconsider breaking the rules if he knew there would<br/>
be consiquences... obviously this kid had more<br/>
problems thanm just video games...<br/>
<br/>
  Don&#39;t even get me started about the suicidal punk on<br/>
48 hours either......   I hate to sound cold and<br/>
lacking in compassion, but quite frankly she asked for<br/>
the view of the players, she undoubtedly SAW 48 hours<br/>
in the first place, and it was most likely what<br/>
provoked the choice of senior thesis.<br/>
<br/>
  Peace out,<br/>

&gt; &gt; In my experience, anyone who would be so afflicted<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; the outcome of a game is not a terribly stable<br/>
&gt; person<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the first place.  Everquest has actually helped<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; save money for tuition, and has kept me out of<br/>
&gt; trouble<br/>
&gt; &gt; as well.  I sit at home and play EverQuest for a<br/>
&gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours every night.  With a starting cost of 9.95<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game, 12.95 a month for a pre-paid card (I<br/>
&gt; hate<br/>
&gt; &gt; credit cards), I get the first month free, 19.99 a<br/>
&gt; &gt; month in internet services (which I would have<br/>
&gt; anyway)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everquest is a subliminal addiction, just like<br/>
&gt; certain people setting <br/>
&gt; all things aside for football... on a much lesser<br/>
&gt; scale of course <br/>
&gt; because quite frank, there is absolutely no<br/>
&gt; redeeming value of <br/>
&gt; dedicating one&#39;s entire time and achieving something<br/>
&gt; in a video game <br/>
&gt; besides personal satisfaction (unless it&#39;s some<br/>
&gt; godawful tournament <br/>
&gt; which I can&#39;t ****ing stand). It all depends on the<br/>
&gt; individual. <br/>
&gt; Certain people can set rigid guidelines for<br/>
&gt; themselves (play for a <br/>
&gt; certain number of hours) and abide by them, and some<br/>
&gt; people can&#39;t. <br/>
