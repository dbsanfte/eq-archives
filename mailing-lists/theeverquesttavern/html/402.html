<div id="ygrps-yiv-797912948">You know, if you find yourself with too much<br/>
stuff to carry around based on your lucky streak, I<br/>
know a level 12 Ranger who wouldn&#39;t mind a few<br/>
trinkets! LOL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A second note: I just started an<br/>
Erudite Enchanter (now level 3, goes by the name<br/>
Arrelna), who will potentially be a jewelry making machine<br/>
for my characters and anyone else who needs stuff (at<br/>
a nominal fee, or less for friends.) Anyone have<br/>
any ideas on powerleveling her and getting her some<br/>
quick cash so she can start buying those gems and<br/>
silver bars? As far as I can tell, I&#39;ve got until level<br/>
8 to get my enchant spell for the metal, and only<br/>
five more practice points needed to get her jewelcraft<br/>
skill to 21, so I&#39;ll have some time to work on other<br/>
things before she starts making stuff. Let me know what<br/>
you all think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taniz (12 Ranger on Mithaniel<br/>
