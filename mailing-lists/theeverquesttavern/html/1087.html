<div id="ygrps-yiv-998304807">hummm... got some good news happy........ you<br/>
just said what no one has taken the time to write<br/>
before basicly... do us all a favor and post that msg on<br/>
every eq related msg board there is and see what kind<br/>
of attetion it will draw... doubt verant will change<br/>
but for what we pay now we should get the premium cs<br/>
and the pop cap on the servers... eq isnt a quality<br/>
game in the sense that the company that maintains it<br/>
because of that....... oh and, HELL YEAH!!! :) speak up<br/>
and let the majority of the population see this... (<br/>
btw the overall costomer base is closer than 300k<br/>
accounts and about 200k acitve... im not sure but that<br/>
seems about right eh?)</div>
