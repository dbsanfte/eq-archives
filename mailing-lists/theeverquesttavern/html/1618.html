<div id="ygrps-yiv-47547605">I actually let my account lapse once, by accident<br/>
of course, and my key still worked a month later<br/>
when I fixed the problem and started back up. Granted,<br/>
this might not apply to an account that&#39;s been<br/>
deactivated for 6 months or more, but I can&#39;t understand why<br/>
Verant would require you to buy their product twice just<br/>
because you quit for a while. (Well, yes, I understand<br/>
why the money-grubbing bastards would but that&#39;s<br/>
besides the point.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe if you send an email to<br/>
Tech Support or CS they might be able to fix the<br/>
problem? Could just be that trying to create a new account<br/>
is keeping you from using the code. If that&#39;s the<br/>
case, Verant might not be too understanding. But if<br/>
you&#39;re using the same account as before, with the same<br/>
station name and all, there shouldn&#39;t be a<br/>
problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let us know what happens, and if you fix this, so we<br/>
know how to address this problem if anyone else runs<br/>
across it in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyral<br/>
