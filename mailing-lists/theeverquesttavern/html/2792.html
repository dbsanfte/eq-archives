<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693165733">This was done by monks, for practical pourposes, to<br/>
try to &quot;integrate&quot; christianity into the &quot;heathen&quot;<br/>
(note quotations) religions.  Jesus was supposedly<br/>
born around march 7th or 17th I can&#39;t recall which. <br/>
And according to the Bible Lucifer was the most<br/>
beautiful of angels, it was his pride in said beauty<br/>
which led to his downfall.   Good to know someone<br/>
knows these things anymore.  This school as it would<br/>
seem is trying to teach wiccan practices without any<br/>
foundation in wiccan culture or beliefs, which are a<br/>
support for the reason BEHIND the practices.  Without<br/>
reason or motive, there can be nothing done.  Example.<br/>
The normans and saxxons killed each other in a bloody<br/>
war.<br/>
.....  It is better to teach their method of warfare<br/>
if you know WHY they fought that way, and what started<br/>
the war in the first place.  I am a supporter of<br/>
diversity, and I believe not all men are created equal<br/>
but rather different, and we should embrace these<br/>
differences and develop them farther, rather than let<br/>
them all melt down in one big pot.. well gotta go <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As a follower of &quot;The Craft,&quot; I wanted to inform you<br/>
&gt; that witchcraft <br/>
&gt; IS a religion...in a way. The pagan religion of<br/>
&gt; Wicca is often <br/>
&gt; referred to as The Craft or Witchcraft. Many of the<br/>
&gt; findings of <br/>
&gt; witchcraft in other religions have been borrowed<br/>
&gt; from Wicca. Such as <br/>
&gt; the traditional Easter celebrations. Easter is<br/>
&gt; derived from Eostra, <br/>
&gt; which is the Wiccan celebration that falls around<br/>
&gt; the time of <br/>
&gt; Easter. Wiccans would paint eggs to celebrate the<br/>
&gt; fertility of the <br/>
&gt; goddess. Christmas also borrows traditions from<br/>
&gt; Wicca&#39;s Yule, which <br/>
&gt; falls at the end of December. Even the common<br/>
&gt; appearance of Satan <br/>
&gt; was pulled from Wicca. When Christianity came to be,<br/>
&gt; christians <br/>
&gt; portrayed Satan as a demonic creature with horns.<br/>
&gt; This was done to <br/>
&gt; try to bastardize Wicca, because one of the gods<br/>
&gt; worshipped in the <br/>
&gt; religion had horns. Of course, this varies from<br/>
&gt; practitioner to <br/>
&gt; practitioner, as Wicca is a &quot;free-form&quot; religion<br/>
&gt; with not many <br/>
&gt; things set in stone.<br/>
