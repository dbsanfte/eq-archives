<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-403301151">Twinking is fun when your really bored & have<br/>
your level one character all decked out not to mention<br/>
you raise levels fast, since all you have all the<br/>
stuff you want you can just focus on leveling like mad.<br/>
BUT I do agree hunting/camping your own stuff is more<br/>
fun than just getting hand me downs or begging..&quot;got<br/>
like items to spare?&quot; I hate beggers! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see it<br/>
as you pay for the game you spend your time getting<br/>
crap & it&#39;s ok to do what you want with your extra<br/>
items give to your other characters, giving it to other<br/>
guild mates or giving it to a real &quot;newbies&quot;.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for beggers ARG!! &quot;got plat to spare?&quot; I mean<br/>
HELLO! go out & hunt, it&#39;s really not that hard to hunt<br/>
things & earn money NOT only that your earning exp as<br/>
well than just hanging out by the bank begging off<br/>
higher levels-it&#39;s times like that I wish I was a player<br/>
killer since dueling a level 3 when your 38 isn&#39;t fair.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m not always mean hehe..I do give items & money<br/>
when I feel like it to a newbie or someone in need or<br/>
head to newbie zones & give stuff to the level 1 or 2<br/>
monsters so when a newbie kills it they are in for a big<br/>
surprise when looting it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways the game is easy<br/>
to play & earn items without being begged for<br/>
things, I just have a hard time understanding beggers I<br/>
guess. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Time to hop on EQ & get my jewlery making<br/>
up, turn on roleplay & see how many beggers will bug<br/>
me for items & plat while I have AFK<br/>
on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*hugs & kisses*&lt;br&gt;Charming level 38 enchantress on Zeb</div>
