<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163242522">There are several things you can do to improve<br/>
your night vision as a<br/>
Human/Erudite/Barbarian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy a Lightstone. Wisps drop them and they usually<br/>
sell for roughly 1pp. Greater Lightstones are better<br/>
but they average 5pp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get a level 4 or higher<br/>
Magician to summon you a wisp stone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy a<br/>
lantern.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get someone to cast Serpent Sight on you. It is a<br/>
spell that grants infravision. Several classes get it<br/>
at various levels including Enchanters at 12 and<br/>
Shaman at 9.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this list helps you<br/>
out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>
