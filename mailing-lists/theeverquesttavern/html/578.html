<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777101428">What you might want to do is go to Steamfont.<br/>
Follow the left wall from the High Elf city until you<br/>
zone twice and you&#39;re there. There&#39;s 2 gnoll camps<br/>
there you could get good experience at, as well as<br/>
medium sized clockworks. I got good experience in that<br/>
zone up to 16 by working my way up from the kobolds<br/>
and skellys to the Mino cave.</div>
