<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031364828">This is what I hear:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You loss in EXP is<br/>
based on your current level and the amount of EXP it<br/>
took to get to that level. So, if you die after just<br/>
getting through a &#39;hell level&#39;, like level 30, you could<br/>
lose a WHOLE bubble (orange) of EXP. However, you&#39;ll<br/>
in general lose between 1 and 2&1/2 blue bars (so<br/>
1/5 to 1/2 of a orange bubble). And of course...only<br/>
after level 5!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, as a druid, you will LOSE<br/>
exp if you kill &#39;amiable&#39; animals!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jim</div>
