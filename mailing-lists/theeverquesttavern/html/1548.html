<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846289575">Good new topic!! I&#39;ve never used /role-- how<br/>
different is it from /anon?? When I&#39;m in GFay, I ALWAYS go<br/>
/anon. I&#39;m usually there to meet with friends and check<br/>
out the HUGE auctions (which, of course, I can never<br/>
afford anything good at. I once sent an /auction I just<br/>
broke 100pp for the first time-- what&#39;s a good<br/>
druid/WIS item for less than that?? Many responses were<br/>
making fun of me-- &quot;good&quot; and &quot;100pp or less&quot; dont go<br/>
together I guess on auctions in Xev)-- i&#39;m getting off<br/>
topic though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inevitably, 20 newbies will seek<br/>
me out and say &quot;gimme SOW&quot; &quot;gimme a bind&quot; &quot;gimme<br/>
plat&quot; I always try to role play and explaint that they<br/>
need to advance thier own skills instead of being<br/>
coddled. Most non-roleplayers don&#39;t like that response.<br/>
Leaving a trail of corpses on the road from orc hill to<br/>
the orc lift is part of the game, anyway!!<br/>
haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love to role play, and have hot keys for battle<br/>
actions. Anyone have good hot keys? My dwarf friend&#39;s<br/>
&quot;goodbye&quot; hotkey is &quot;May your blows fairly split the skulls<br/>
of thine enemies!&quot; I am a Druid of Tunare, and when<br/>
i invoke the wrath of Tunare on her less gracious<br/>
creations (ie. cast terrorize animal), I can be found to<br/>
say &quot;Flee from the might of Tunare, traitorous<br/>
beast!!&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know that /anon takes away your guild<br/>
name, so i&#39;ve kept it off, because i&#39;m a recruiter now.<br/>
how does /role work??? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you roleplay? When<br/>
do you break out of it? Do you ever get into a group<br/>
of all roleplayers? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funny quick story (then<br/>
I&#39;m done)-- i was in a full group. I was RP-ing as<br/>
xela, the Tunare desciple who is also a group tactics<br/>
master. We had an RP-ing mage who was an &quot;absent minded<br/>
genious,&quot; and a quiet and shaddy looking RP-ing dwarf, who<br/>
was /anon but who I assumed was a rouge from his<br/>
dagger. We got into the middle of a great battle, and all<br/>
of the sudden, I&#39;m fighting next to a DE with the<br/>
same name as the dwarf!! Turns out, the RP-er was<br/>
really a DE chanter who was infiltrating good groups!!!<br/>
I caught him, and he quickly re-cast illusion dwarf<br/>
and went on about how he was a faithful dwarf of<br/>
Kaladim. When our party broke, he went back to DE and<br/>
taunted us-- &quot;Haha, now that I have assessed your<br/>
strengths and weaknesses, you will surely fall to the<br/>
followers of Innoruk!!! Trusting fools!!!!!&quot;<br/>
