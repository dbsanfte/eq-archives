<div id="ygrps-yiv-675694891">yes<br/>
i have seen the disappearing characters often<br/>
sometimes for a few seconds or even a few minutes<br/>
in zone areas and on boats usually<br/>
i figured it was some kind of video lag<br/>
i also have problems with what i call the &quot;which way did he go&quot; phenomena<br/>
where you are following another player character and they suddenly appear to be running in the opposite direction they are actually going in for a few seconds<br/>
this can be a problem when someone is leading you out of a dangerous zone you are lost in<br/>
