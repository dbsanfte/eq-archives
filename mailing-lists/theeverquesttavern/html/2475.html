<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210211833">[quote]OMG-- trying to explain /assist,<br/>
targeting, avoiding hits, pet control, nuking, the benefit<br/>
of the snare spell-- things we just take for<br/>
granted.[/quote]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m trying that, on Sullon Zek! One guy I&#39;m grouping<br/>
with regularly is a Ranger. He hit 9th level the other<br/>
day, and I said, &quot;Great, go get your spells.&quot; He said,<br/>
&quot;What spells?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yeah, /assist is an alien<br/>
concept. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s even trained Kick or Dodge.<br/>
There&#39;s also a Druid with us who&#39;s also on ger first<br/>
character, Got my work cut out for me, and I&#39;m not even that<br/>
experienced.</div>
