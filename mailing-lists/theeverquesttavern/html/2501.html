<div id="ygrps-yiv-306299538">It does thank you. My next question is this then.<br/>
I have not played in some time. When I went to log<br/>
in my comp said that I needed to download DirectX8<br/>
so I did and did everything that I was prompted to<br/>
do; however, when I went to play it said something<br/>
about not having 3D? What&#39;s up with that? And how much<br/>
MB am I looking at? Thanks. The Raven.</div>
