<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676582384">There are some robes you can get at lower levels<br/>
but they don&#39;t have very good stats (usually don&#39;t<br/>
have any INT). There is a quest in Felwithe to get a<br/>
GOSSAMER robe. It&#39;s a white robe that is quite pretty<br/>
(especially on high elves ^_^). You need to get the BRASS<br/>
EARRING from the TASKMASTER in CRUSHBONE. When you get it<br/>
you give it to the FEMALE HIGH ELF SLAVE (in CB) and<br/>
she gives you a note. You then take the note to NIOLA<br/>
in the MAGICIAN&#39;s Guild in FELWITHE. Niola gives you<br/>
the robe then. It has no stats but it is AC 8 which<br/>
is pretty good for a newbie. ^_^&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for<br/>
jewelery making I hope you have a way to make a lot of<br/>
money. It&#39;s very expensive!! It&#39;s the most expensive<br/>
trade skill to learn. At first you won&#39;t be able to<br/>
make anything that spectactular but eventually you<br/>
will make a lot of money back selling the jewelery you<br/>
make to players that need the stats. I assume you are<br/>
an Enchanter? It&#39;s easier if you are because you can<br/>
enchant your own metals. There are lots of good trade<br/>
skill guides online. You should try Allakhazam,<br/>
EverLore or EQ Statics. Personally I&#39;m a master Baker. LOL<br/>
So I can&#39;t help much with jewelery. ^_^ Good luck to<br/>
you though. Master Jewelers are always wanted!!</div>
