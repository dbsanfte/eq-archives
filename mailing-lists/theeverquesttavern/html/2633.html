<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322188509">Still can&#39;t get used to these Yahoo Groups, but I&#39;m glad I found a <br/>
good EverQuest &quot;club&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I just started a little over a week ago.  I&#39;m on the Fennin Ro server <br/>
and was wanted to see if I could find someone else who is <br/>
there &quot;regularly&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This is my 1st time playing a MMORPG, so I&#39;m still going thru the <br/>
school of hard knocks...but its been fun so far.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping someone is as new to this as me,<br/>
