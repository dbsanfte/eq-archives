<div id="ygrps-yiv-47664704">Well, if you were to buy someone else&#39;s<br/>
character/account, you&#39;ve just violated the end user liscence<br/>
agreement. Now your account can be banned! Kiss your $$$$<br/>
goodbye!!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even if you don&#39;t get caught, there the<br/>
infamous I did not get all that I paid for scenario. I&#39;ve<br/>
encountered some bought accounts. They&#39;re usually easy to<br/>
find. Just listen for the shout of &#39;Where do I buy<br/>
water? How do I attack? etc. coming from the 50th<br/>
warrior in full plane gear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, you have no idea<br/>
of the character&#39;s reputation. Is he KOS everywhere?<br/>
Did the player screw over all the other players? I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t take the chance myself. I enjoy developing my<br/>
character from the ground up. Just don&#39;t pick Rallos Zek as<br/>
your god and expect to run through Butcherblock and<br/>
live. At least not for the first bunch of<br/>
levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keiyuki</div>
