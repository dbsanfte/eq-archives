<b>Subject:</b> Re: TWINKING-- a discussion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710664850">I dont mind twinking as long as its not<br/>
rediculous...the level 2 warrior in full plate thing is too far.<br/>
Sometimes I feel like a twink because of stuff that I am<br/>
given but really that is how life works. You get<br/>
something new and you give your old stuff away, either to a<br/>
guild mate maybe or to one of your other characters. I<br/>
dont like the EC market and wonder how some of these<br/>
ppl get the items they sell.&lt;br&gt;As for the ability to<br/>
use certain items, that sort of exists now. Example,<br/>
being a Shadow Knight myself one of my guild mates<br/>
found a Dark Reaver and gave it to me. I can use the<br/>
sword but being lvl22 only it wont proc steal strength<br/>
for me yet. I get the message &quot;your will is not<br/>
strong enough to control this weapon&quot;. But the sword is<br/>
still cool to have.&lt;br&gt;As for the sex thing, sometimes<br/>
I wonder how ppl take a perfectly good game and<br/>
turn it into a soap opera! I mean, getting married and<br/>
stuff? Give me a break!&lt;br&gt;Also I know a lot of players<br/>
who play opposite gender characters. Most of the guys<br/>
play girls because other players tend to walk up and<br/>
give you stuff more, and are more willing to help you.<br/>
I think the girls play guys to keep from getting<br/>
hit on so much. I though could never play a female<br/>
character, it would just be too weird for me.&lt;br&gt;Well enough<br/>
rambling, I guess I also fit into the techie thing being an<br/>
engineer, we are just not right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uinan<br/>
