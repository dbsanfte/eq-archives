<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090796653">A lot of people think that choosing a half elf<br/>
druid is silly due to the stats, but don&#39;t worry about<br/>
it. The numbers in the game make a difference, but<br/>
not much of a difference at all. A skillful player<br/>
who knows how to use the abilities he has can be a<br/>
lot more useful than an idiot with great stats ;)<br/>
Also, choose the combination that YOU want to play. For<br/>
roleplaying, a challenge, or just to be unique, and choice can<br/>
be great. For example, I currently play a Gnome<br/>
Cleric. Looking at a gnomes stats, it seems a gnome<br/>
cleric would be horrible. Low strength (Can&#39;t carry much<br/>
armor around) and especially low wisdom (BARBARIANS<br/>
have a higher base wisdom!), seems that a gnome cleric<br/>
would be impossible to play, and useless to a group.<br/>
Wrong. I have gotten my cleric to level 26 and love<br/>
playing him every day. MANY people have said that Quinon<br/>
(my cleric) is one of the best clerics they have ever<br/>
grouped with, eventhough he has pathetic wisdom. Everyone<br/>
stresses the numbers, but don&#39;t let them bother you.<br/>
Attributes that may not seem important to your class can<br/>
still be useful. Quinon&#39;s high agility allows him to<br/>
avoid being hit, and his high intelligence allows him<br/>
to learn skills very quickly, eventhough these<br/>
attributes aren&#39;t thought of as important to a cleric at<br/>
all. Just choose the race/class you want and enjoy it,<br/>
you aren&#39;t going to ruin your characters usefullness<br/>
just because of some numbers.</div>
