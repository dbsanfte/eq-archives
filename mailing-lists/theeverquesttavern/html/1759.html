<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057187333">I usually play a tank when I group (though I have<br/>
been on the other end - I also have a shaman I use<br/>
sometimes) and the number one rule is :&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* KEEP THE<br/>
HEALER ALIVE AT ALL COSTS!! *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you can keep the<br/>
healer alive, you can live to fight another fight.<br/>
Anyone that plays a tank should know that. If it means<br/>
taking a few hits from behind while trying to taunt the<br/>
creature attacking the healer, so be it. As a tank, your<br/>
number one priority is to protect your team... no matter<br/>
what the cost... Even if it means staying and taking<br/>
the creature toe to toe, while they run... This is<br/>
the life of a tank...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just my 2 cents...</div>
