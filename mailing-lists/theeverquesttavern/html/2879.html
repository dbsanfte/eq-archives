myself back in college (GURPS system) and it did nothing to hinder my <br/>
social life. I studied, partied, loved women, and drove fast cars. I <br/>
am also an alumni from Delta Upsilon. It&#39;s all about budgeting your <br/>
time. Moral of the story is, people are unique (even in the RPG <br/>
community) so don&#39;t be so quick to judge an entire group. <br/>
Stereotyping an entire RPG community like that is ignorant.<br/>
