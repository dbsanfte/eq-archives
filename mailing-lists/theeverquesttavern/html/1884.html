<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064571817">Having read, and re-read all the posts, I&#39;d have<br/>
to agree...I don&#39;t mind twinking as much as I used<br/>
to...especially now that my high level chars can help my low<br/>
ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, on a PVP server, I think I&#39;d still have to draw<br/>
the line. I did hear that the most recent PVP server<br/>
was very fun to play on at the beginning since not a<br/>
single player was twinked...but I&#39;m sure they are<br/>
approaching the lvl 50&#39;s by now!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jim&lt;br&gt;CoJim, Druid<br/>
