<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243846799">Some more on the drunkard... Taken from<br/>
alakazam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bandit Sisters: This starts in Felwithe with the High<br/>
Elf Paladin Guildmaster. He will ask you if you are<br/>
&quot;ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare&quot; Say &quot;I am ready<br/>
to serve the Clerics of Tunare&quot; and he will ask if<br/>
you are new to this or experienced (something to that<br/>
degree). If you say you are inexperienced, he tells you<br/>
about a fallen member of his order in Kelethin. (If you<br/>
say you are experienced, he gives you the jojongua&#39;s<br/>
pelt quest). You then need to talk to the drunk named<br/>
Tandan Nybright in Kelethin and listen to his tale. His<br/>
sad story centers around his four daughters in Lesser<br/>
Faydark who have joined the dervish cutthrouat and are<br/>
giving his family a bad name. Being a good father and<br/>
paladin, he asks you to murder each of his daughters,<br/>
retrieve their pearl necklaces and return them to him all<br/>
at once. Beware. These bandits are pretty tough and<br/>
will not willingly part with their jewelry<br/>
(approximately level 10 to 13). You will get experience, faction<br/>
and an item when you return all four necklaces.<br/>
Sometimes your reward is a Targ Shield. (Submitted by Awen,<br/>
