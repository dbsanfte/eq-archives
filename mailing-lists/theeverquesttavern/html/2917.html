<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071253953">hi there!  I was wondering if ANYONE could help me out.  I had <br/>
everquest a LONG time ago (it&#39;s such a GREAT game) but then my mom <br/>
threw it out, basically.  I haven&#39;t had it for a few years now but I <br/>
bought the &quot;Everquest Trilogy&quot; just a few weeks out.  Now i&#39;m having <br/>
some problems and I just don&#39;t understand...<br/>
<br/>
I have all the requirements for the game, including DirectX 8.1. BUT, <br/>
the game WON&#39;T start!  It keeps saying &quot;3D not available.&quot;  Can <br/>
ANYONE help me out?  We have 3D, directX 8.1, the requirements...  <br/>
But it won&#39;t work... anyone have any ideas at all?  I really don&#39;t <br/>
want to return this game... I would luv yah if you&#39;d help me!  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs and Kisses,<br/>
Wish</div>
