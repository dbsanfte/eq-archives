<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433336618">Holy crap... I didn&#39;t have anything close to 100<br/>
plat at lvl 12.... keerap... I was too worried about<br/>
wondering how I was going to be able to upgrade my spells<br/>
in 5 levels to worry about what I was wearing or<br/>
wielding. Come to think of it, I used a non-magical cracked<br/>
staff paired with a wooden shield until I was level 18<br/>
or so. Don&#39;t know how I got away with it, but I<br/>
did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that will all change, all change. When you hit<br/>
the 30s, this is when you can start getting your<br/>
hands on some decent money. Do giants for cash, gnolls<br/>
in south karana, go dungeon hopping in Unrest or<br/>
Runnyeye for some stuff that&#39;ll sell. Even Cazic Thule is<br/>
a decent place to head to, try and win the rolls on<br/>
ravenscale or lizardscale mantles and such. Mid 30s take on<br/>
the Avatar of Fear, and sell those claws... whoo!<br/>
&lt;br&gt;But anyway, don&#39;t be worried too much about cash at<br/>
level 12. As long as you can survive, you are doing<br/>
great!&lt;br&gt;Keep your spells upgraded at all times, and get a<br/>
magical weapon of some sort. For paladins, the price of a<br/>
Ghoulbane will be dropping soon, merely due to the<br/>
introduction of a not terribly difficult quest to get it.<br/>
Locate your nearest druid and see if you can convince<br/>
him to get you one. Be extra kind. A level 35 druid<br/>
will have no problem getting around to all the<br/>
locations for the quest, and should only have trouble with<br/>
the creatures involved in Najena (because it is<br/>
indoors). A ghoulbane is an excellent weapon, and I would<br/>
advise you holding out until one is made available to<br/>
you. From there, take on Befallen or Unrest to put<br/>
that dismiss undead proc to work for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai<br/>
