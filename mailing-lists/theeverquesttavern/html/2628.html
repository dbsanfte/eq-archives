<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002237628">Well I sorta got good news. I went to the comp shop I was telling <br/>
ya&#39;ll about. They&#39;ve got some decent prices on computer components, <br/>
but they don&#39;t sell complete systems. I guess this is good since I <br/>
only want a new motherboard and chip. (I also have to but a case as <br/>
they won&#39;t install anything that isn&#39;t theirs, ie. their motherboard <br/>
and chip into my case with my hard drive etc,.)  I am looking at <br/>
about $200.00-$230.00, but I will also be selling them my case and <br/>
old mother board and chip so that price may go down about say $50.00? <br/>
Anyway I told them that I would be back in in four weeks to get <br/>
everything, so keep your fingers crossed for me ok? (The reason for <br/>
four weeks is that rent is due in two weeks, so I&#39;ll have to wait <br/>
till after rent.) The Raven<br/>

P.S. I can&#39;t remember who had asked me to call EQ about my account. <br/>
At this moment I am not too worried if my characters are wiped out. <br/>
Right now I just want to play the game! And yes I am still being <br/>
charged monthly for the game. Since my c/c is a debit card I can see <br/>
if it is being charged, and it is.</div>
