<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534321911">I know what you mean. I&#39;ve loaned things out<br/>
before, but I&#39;ve been luckey. I&#39;ve borrowed stuff, and<br/>
had it taken back before I was ready, but gave it<br/>
back because it wasn&#39;t mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be nice<br/>
to build some sort of business type trading into the<br/>
game. You rent stuff. When you call for it back, you<br/>
get it back. It just gets transferred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. I<br/>
like your pic. hehe I doubt it&#39;s you tho, not that it<br/>
even matters.</div>
