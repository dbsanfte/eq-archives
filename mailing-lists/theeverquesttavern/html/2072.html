<div id="ygrps-yiv-78480469">There are some eq bugs. Such as fighting some<br/>
mobs that wont attack and other stuff like that but if<br/>
you do any of them eq will suspend your account. The<br/>
thing is you need to be caught. But all the bugs you<br/>
would hear about would be well know to the gms so it<br/>
would be easy to get caught. In others words its not<br/>
worth the chance of getting caught. So dont do<br/>
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien</div>
