<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456385569">I&#39;ve been to lower Guk once - it&#39;s really creepy<br/>
there. I didn&#39;t go in that far - my group was composed<br/>
of myself (when I was lvl 31) and a lvl 33 cleric.<br/>
But i&#39;ll hafta go there to get some nice items.&lt;br&gt;At<br/>
the auction today, i bought 2 silver-plated bracers<br/>
for 100plat each (quite a steal) and a serpentine<br/>
bracer. Stats are as follows:&lt;br&gt; silver-plated bracer:<br/>
7AC +5 sv disease and poison&lt;br&gt; serpentine bracer:<br/>
1AC +9AGI +3DEX&lt;br&gt;They give a nice platemail<br/>
appearance =)&lt;br&gt;Tomorrow night will be the raid on<br/>
Permafrost. Will you be able to attend, Kaylin? Gimme a tell<br/>
ingame and i&#39;ll fill you in on the details.</div>
