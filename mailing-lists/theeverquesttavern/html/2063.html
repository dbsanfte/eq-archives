<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071283133">Um, no, I don&#39;t think so. Anyone who needs to do<br/>
the run can probably do it in their sleep. And you&#39;d<br/>
still have to sit there and watch, &#39;cause autofollow<br/>
can fail (like when you run into a tree).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually, I rather enjoy taking group members on autofollow<br/>
through Butcherblock, because I know all the fun<br/>
shortcuts. Thing is, as a Rogue with Safe Fall, it&#39;s fine<br/>
for me, but I have injured my group members doing<br/>
this!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht&lt;br&gt;Rogue of 20-odd seasons&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>
