<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725137154">That&#39;s a good way to do it but also there&#39;s a<br/>
difference between Spider Silks and Spiderling Silks. I&#39;d<br/>
buy a stack of Spider Silks for 1pp a stack. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t offer anything for Spiderling Silks. It&#39;d be<br/>
easier on me to just farm those. Two hits and<br/>
splat...they&#39;re gone and almost always drop one or two silks.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jewelry is going to be highly expensive and not very<br/>
profitable till you&#39;ve dumped in a lot of plat though. After<br/>
that though, the skill more than makes up for the slow<br/>
start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as baking, afraid there&#39;s not much market for<br/>
them. However, there are some good items you can bake.<br/>
Forget the recipies but if you look in on<br/>
www.eqtraders.com &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will find a WEALTH of trade skill<br/>
info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can bake wedding cakes, bday cakes and best of<br/>
all-- Stat increasing items as well as light fluffy<br/>
pastries that last forever for you overburdened monk<br/>
friends that have neglected baking (for shame monks. Fish<br/>
rolls are you best banquet .1 stone items... I think.<br/>
LOL. My trick is to eat cheap stuff and load the first<br/>
food slot with stat increasers).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
