<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638575470">I tried to download the patch on Tuesday night<br/>
after loading the game on my and the wifes computers,<br/>
but no luck (and I have cable internet!). So....I<br/>
just got up a half hour early Wednesday morning (Ugg!<br/>
5:00 is sooo dark!) and had no problem, downloaded to<br/>
both computers in about 5mins. Worked great on my<br/>
computer but not on the wifes. Now I have to buy her a new<br/>
Video Card because the one she got with the computer<br/>
can&#39;t handle the game anymore. This game gets more<br/>
expensive everyday!! :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanjien Cheveyo &lt;Free<br/>
