<div id="ygrps-yiv-496245231">Actually, they have discussed gambling on the EQ<br/>
boards. Since HighHold Keep already has gambling tables,<br/>
and dealers set up, perhaps it&#39;s not that far away<br/>
that you can blow your bank account and win oh.. I<br/>
don&#39;t know... a bronze dagger. =)&lt;br&gt;Thank you for<br/>
playing, have a complimentary trip through the buffet<br/>
while you&#39;re on the way out.</div>
