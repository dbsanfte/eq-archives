<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080889188">Okay I have a level 26 druid and I did a lot of<br/>
soloing in Butcher Block until i was 10 or 11 (can&#39;t<br/>
remember) then I went to N. Ro and soloed Scarabs. (dk<br/>
Blue) till 12. (just don&#39;t go for trantalas cause<br/>
poison is dangerous even as a druid.) Then I grouped for<br/>
the first time in a derv group in N. Ro. I leveled to<br/>
13 and then went to group at orc highway in Oasis.<br/>
You can probably go to oasis at 12 cause groups like<br/>
a druid who can damage shield the tanks, and you<br/>
have an okay heal spell.&lt;br&gt; You can stay in oasis<br/>
till like 20 and still group good. Groups are great<br/>
for druids. You can practice on the support role you<br/>
play. (and trust me ya you can solo, but grouping is<br/>
usually more fun and rewarding.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After 20 make<br/>
your way to lake of ill omen, just passed Firiona Vie<br/>
(i know i spelled it wrong) and you can group there<br/>
for a long time)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly I guess I just<br/>
want to say that if you are just a tad bit careful in<br/>
Butcher Block, you can solo there without worries of<br/>
death. Just don&#39;t go to chessboard and stay close to the<br/>
crossroads guard shed. I have run to them on many ocasion.<br/>
hehe</div>
