<div id="ygrps-yiv-189170015">Well, lemme see if I can give you an idea of<br/>
what&#39;s so &quot;awesome&quot; about it (your bf&#39;s<br/>
term?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a couple of ways to think of EQ. One is a<br/>
chat room with fancy graphics. That view emphasizes<br/>
the community, and interaction that you get with<br/>
people from around the world. That&#39;s not my favorite way<br/>
to think of EQ, though; if you want that, go to<br/>
Active Worlds, where all you do is really chat (though<br/>
you can build stuff, too).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A second way to<br/>
think of it is a MMORPG -- Massively Multiplayer Online<br/>
Role Playing Game. Think of it this way -- at any<br/>
given time, there are probably between 1000 and 2000<br/>
people playing on your server (EQ has about 40 different<br/>
servers to handle the load). Overall, something like<br/>
350,000 people subscribe to the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your bf<br/>
ever played Dungeons and Dragons or a similar pen and<br/>
paper-based fantasy-based game, then EQ is like having a Game<br/>
Master (or Dungeon Master) ready to play with you at any<br/>
time. You get to play-act being something else -- I<br/>
mainly play a Dwarf Rogue (thief), and a Troll Shadow<br/>
Knight (evil warrior/necromancer combo). Other folks<br/>
like to play &quot;casters&quot; -- magic users, druids,<br/>
healers/clerics, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s really just a chance to be<br/>
someone else for a while, for me. What makes it awesome<br/>
is that you&#39;re constantly interacting with other<br/>
real people, and you develop relationships with them<br/>
(hopefully good ones) over time. Last night, I ran into<br/>
someone I hadn&#39;t played with for quite a while, and it<br/>
was like running into an old friend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s<br/>
lots more, but that&#39;s a good start for now, I<br/>
hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht&lt;br&gt;27 Rogue&lt;br&gt;Specializing in backstabbing, corpse<br/>
