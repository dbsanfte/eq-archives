<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122573439">The player vs player servers are made to do such<br/>
things. I do like that you feel bad for kill a cleric. I<br/>
myself am a cleric of the 21st season. people really<br/>
don&#39;t know what it like to be a healer until there have<br/>
played one. there gain a new respect for them:). To sum<br/>
it up, don&#39;t feel bad about it, and hey you might<br/>
have made a new friend. It&#39;s nice to now some one<br/>
cares for the lonely cleric.</div>
