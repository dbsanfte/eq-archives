<div id="ygrps-yiv-905820946">Sorry about this.... brain fart. I read bard, but<br/>
thought druid. You can most certainly wear banded, then<br/>
later on bronze. I also play a 19th level half-elf<br/>
bard. You might want to consider skipping bronze tho...<br/>
it&#39;s very heavy, so if you&#39;re decked out head to toe,<br/>
you can&#39;t really carry much else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry about<br/>
that :(</div>
