&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;I received this interesting email from someone who<br/>
was offended by my comment in one thread where I said<br/>
that there wasn&#39;t much strategy available to wizards.<br/>
I thought I&#39;d share it with you, with the author&#39;s<br/>
permission of course.&lt;br&gt;--------SNIP--------&lt;br&gt;Quote on<br/>
Quote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The Wizard is the most straightforward casting class<br/>
in the game, in the &lt;br&gt;same fashion that the<br/>
warrior is the most straightforward melee class.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s not much strategy to them, they do one thing and<br/>
they do that one &lt;br&gt;thing well. The addition of<br/>
travel spells does add some diversity, but they &lt;br&gt;are<br/>
still primarily the same. We really have no plans to<br/>
redefine the &lt;br&gt;class.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you mean there&#39;s<br/>
no strategy to them? God you&#39;re so wrong about<br/>
&lt;br&gt;that. I can go into a million reasons why. But just<br/>
take a look at the &lt;br&gt;possible scenarios a Wizard is<br/>
in control of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1- Lessening Dmg done to tanks<br/>
by blasting at the right time. For example, &lt;br&gt;when<br/>
mob X has 10 K HP, the party you&#39;re with engages<br/>
MobX. Through the &lt;br&gt;corse of the battle, you need to<br/>
blast to reduce mob X&#39;s HP so less dmg is &lt;br&gt;done to<br/>
your tanks. It then leads to less mana your cleric is<br/>
going to have &lt;br&gt;to heal the tanks, it basically leads<br/>
to the party of 6 having doing do less &lt;br&gt;to kill<br/>
Mob X.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2- Mana Control- Knowing when to evac<br/>
or not. It&#39;s essintial to know how &lt;br&gt;much mana you<br/>
have, and how much mana you it takes to evac. An over<br/>
blasting &lt;br&gt;wizard is a dead party in a tight<br/>
situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3- Knowing when to use Ice, Fire, Magic, and stuns.<br/>
It&#39;s essintial to know a &lt;br&gt;mobs weakness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4-<br/>
When not to blast at all, yes there are times, albeit<br/>
very slim there is &lt;br&gt;simply no need to blast. Which<br/>
my point here leads back to point #2 of mana<br/>
&lt;br&gt;control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wizards are extremely important, and a highly strategic<br/>
class. Many of the &lt;br&gt;&quot;KEWL D00D Wizards&quot; Just want to<br/>
hit Mobs for 10,000 dmg, this is why they<br/>
&lt;br&gt;complain on the boards, and obviously don&#39;t understand the<br/>
reasoning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wanna here a quick story? My guild was doing fire<br/>
giants one night, they &lt;br&gt;decided to go ahead and<br/>
basically do it with minimal casters. (No wizards &lt;br&gt;were<br/>
present at all). Guess what? The fight with skarlon took<br/>
over 10 &lt;br&gt;minutes, the clerics were all OOM and<br/>
Skarlon was winning. They did pull out &lt;br&gt;victory but<br/>
christ out of 24 there they lost 12. Next time around<br/>
they &lt;br&gt;brought wizards, we lost no one<br/>
there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve hit Lord Nagafen for 5 K DMG before. He has 32 K<br/>
HP, you know how great &lt;br&gt;that is that I can go in<br/>
and nail him for a quick 5 K? Of course this<br/>
&lt;br&gt;doesn&#39;t always happen, but I still get a nice clean 3K on<br/>
him. Vox is lower &lt;br&gt;because I have to use a L 44<br/>
fire spell. Hmmm Ask a necro, or mage how they &lt;br&gt;did<br/>
vs the dragons. All spells resisted, and their pets<br/>
just got feared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Listen I do think the wizard<br/>
class can have a couple things done to it. Just &lt;br&gt;to<br/>
make them a little more interesting. I would be happy<br/>
to offer you some &lt;br&gt;reasonable suggestions if<br/>
you&#39;re interested. And im looking foward to &lt;br&gt;becoming<br/>
even more deadlier in kunark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless, you<br/>
guys are smart not stupid, please re-think your &quot;No<br/>
strategy &lt;br&gt;Comments&quot;.&lt;br&gt;------SNIP------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think<br/>
he made some very good points, not the least of<br/>
which is that your class is what you make of it. If you<br/>
want to look at a wizard as a mindless nuker, you can<br/>
do that, but you&#39;re cheating yourself out of the<br/>
nuances of the class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Gordon</div>
