<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876419691">just for argument sake though<br/>
there is also the lake of ill omen in kunark (long boat ride and dangerous run to get there)<br/>
(i didn&#39;t like it because there was so much resistance to some of my favorite druid spells and the nearest safe zone is kos to goodies being the iskar newbie area)<br/>
and there is paludal caverns (sp?) on luclin (never went but have heard good things)<br/>
i still would prefer highkeep though<br/>
i have a 17 de sk alt ill be taking there soon<br/>
hehe clopped goblin coming up<br/>
to get to highkeep, get a druid to take you to north karana<br/>
run south east from the druid rings to the river, go left at river to the bridge, cross bridge to east karana<br/>
follow road from there and you will see a stone marker that will point the way to highpass hold<br/>
it turns into a light road that takes you up a mountian pass (dont fall off)<br/>
when you zone in to highpass hold watch out for gnolls and dead end paths, veer to the right <br/>
then left and you should see the keep entrance<br/>
or just ask someone<br/>
(invis and sow of course)<br/>
ok..so maybe druids are excessively helpful sometimes<br/>
lol<br/>

  Subject: [The EverQuest Tavern] Shammie Barb needs help<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I am back from a four month hiatus because of a move. Since I am back <br/>
  with the game and I have yet to find my EQ books and that notes that <br/>
  are sitll pack away somewhere, I am looking for a place to send my <br/>
  lvl 22 Shammie Barb for a good hunt. My character right now is in E. <br/>
  Commonlands. Any advice or suggestions would be helpful as I get back <br/>
  into the game. Thanks for your help.<br/>
