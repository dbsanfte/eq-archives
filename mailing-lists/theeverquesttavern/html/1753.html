<div id="ygrps-yiv-329720011">Forgot to add... here&#39;s another weird trick that<br/>
works well for any casters that can buff...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buff<br/>
the tank just as the battle begins. Any mob not being<br/>
taunted by the tank will almost certainly peel to you.<br/>
Healing works too. Grin. Or just nuke an add... then just<br/>
kite it around until everyone else is ready. Depends<br/>
on the situation but that&#39;s another way to take care<br/>
of adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I only mention this b/c timing IS<br/>
everything. I&#39;ve sometimes forgotten and casted a DS (damage<br/>
shield) too early. Whew... mobs hit hard above 25.<br/>
LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
