<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867567346">Okay, I&#39;ve been playing EQ for about a week now and my Dark Elf <br/>
Shadowknight is level 9. And so far I like the character.<br/>
<br/>
My question is exactly how restricted is it to play a Dark Elf when I <br/>
reach upper levels. I know that they are not liked in some places in <br/>
the game and guards kill you and stuff. But is it going to be so bad <br/>
that I&#39;m totally restricted to a small area and its not gonna be fun <br/>
eventually? I just don&#39;t want to get to level 30 or so and find out <br/>
that I can&#39;t go behind the areas I&#39;m already exploring.</div>
