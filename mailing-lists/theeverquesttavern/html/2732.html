<div id="ygrps-yiv-402198266">Actually there&#39;s usually one NPC that sells it in about every major city in Norrath.  It&#39;s called Cloudy Potion, though, and usually runs around 11pp a pop for one cast.  <br/>
<br/>
Just to give you one place, coming in off the boat in Freeport, you can go two ways (at least above ground) to WFreeport....towards the left, by the tailor shop, brew barrel and smithing area; or towards the right, that brings you out by the monk training area.  Take the right zone in.  Just after you zone in, but before you reach the monk area, there will be an opening in the wall on your right.  There&#39;s two buildings in there, a shop (can&#39;t remember the name of it) and a small house.  Go in that shop and one of those will sell it.  I know from experience that Qeynos, Nerriak, Kelethin and Thurgadin have them too.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
