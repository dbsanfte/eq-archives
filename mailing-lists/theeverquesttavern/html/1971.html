<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-795664687">I would list a few exceptions, depending on your<br/>
class of course. I mean, if you&#39;re a gnome, you don&#39;t<br/>
want to be bound in SF all the time-- what a<br/>
pain!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generally, though, you&#39;re right for any elves. BUT- If<br/>
you&#39;re a caster, it&#39;s a lot easier to bind in DC if<br/>
you&#39;re staying in Unrest for any amount of time. It&#39;s a<br/>
pain to run back there all the way from GFay if you<br/>
die. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, Bind just outside the MM zone in<br/>
Lfay if you&#39;re taking on MM. Death is common in both<br/>
Unrest and MM, so it just makes it easier to be close at<br/>
hand-- your group will appreciate not haveing to wait<br/>
for you--haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BONUS-- all classes can be bound<br/>
ANYWHERE in Gfay. So for melee types, get a bind at the<br/>
zone boundry to BB if you&#39;re in Unrest (i think it&#39;s a<br/>
closer run than Kaladim), zone boundry to Lfay if you&#39;re<br/>
going to MM, or the zone boundry to CB if you&#39;ll be in<br/>
CB. There are always high level casters at the Wizzie<br/>
spires who can bind you there, or maybe walk over to the<br/>
zone with you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.-- Unless you do<br/>
something outrageous as the controlled of a Yahoo club, you<br/>
will generally not be liable for anything that happens<br/>
to people who avail themselves of the message<br/>
boards. To protect yourself further, though, you could<br/>
put a disclaimer in the Club discription. People have<br/>
to be responsible for their own actions-- i&#39;d take<br/>
that case, in CA at least.</div>
