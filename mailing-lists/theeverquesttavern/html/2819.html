<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182228708">It works fairly well with dial up. I myself use dial up. My standard <br/>
connection speed is 26400 and I really only have problems in the <br/>
bazaar which has hundreds of players in it. <br/>
  Of course a faster system will help. My old box is a p3 450 with <br/>
512ram and a 64m vid card. It very playable with those specs. My new <br/>
box is a p4 2.2 with 512 ram and a 128 vid card. I have very little <br/>
lag in the bazaar with it using the same settings and dial up.<br/>
