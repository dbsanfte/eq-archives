<b>Subject:</b> I think Wood Elves are against pixies <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113795556">There is a ranger quest which involoves killing<br/>
pixies, and one of the NPCs in the ranger guild refers to<br/>
them as the &quot;blues meanies.&quot; Since the ranger and<br/>
druid guilds work together, it would be logical that<br/>
the druids also consider pixies to be bad.</div>
