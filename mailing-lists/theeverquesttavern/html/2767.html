<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327149405">Ah. If you&#39;re in Qeynos now, you might think about going to the <br/>
Warrens, on the Isle of Odus. Take a boat to Erud (Erudite city), and <br/>
head south. You&#39;ll have to go through the Evil city of Paineel&#39;s <br/>
training yard to do so . . . that&#39;s not usually a problem, however. <br/>
Zone into Paineel, go forward until you see the HUGE FREAKIN&#39; HOLE <br/>
(don&#39;t jump or fall into it, you&#39;ll probably lose your stuff), and <br/>
turn left.  When you see daylight ahead of you, stop, align yourself <br/>
with one of the trees out in the yard, and motor for it.  Once you&#39;re <br/>
well into the center of the yard, you&#39;re OK. Then turn right and look <br/>
for the tunnel to the Warrens and the Hole.<br/>
<br/>
Would be fun to hook up with you, but I&#39;m on Sullon Zek. Dangerous <br/>
place, but I like it like that. <br/>
