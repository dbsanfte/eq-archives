<b>Subject:</b> Taniz says hello (and a few notes) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728234979">My name is Taniz, and I&#39;m an everquest addictee.<br/>
(Oops, this isnt&#39; the everquest 12 step<br/>
group!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just wanted to say a quick hello. I just started<br/>
playing about a week ago. I&#39;m a level 8 (and 1/2) Ranger,<br/>
playing on the Mith. Marr server. I&#39;ve met some great<br/>
people so far, found a few near my level to group with<br/>
and level quickly. I spend most of my time around the<br/>
Q. Hills area, or at least I did.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which<br/>
leads me to my first note/question. Has anyone else<br/>
heard the rumors that the GM&#39;s may be leaving Q. Hills<br/>
in the state it is in? Full of skele&#39;s and warbones?<br/>
Kind of makes gnoll hunting on the upper levels of BB<br/>
seem tame. :)]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note 2:&lt;br&gt;I just started<br/>
working on my fletching skill, and as such I&#39;ve become a<br/>
veritable arrow factory! If anyone&#39;s looking for arrows<br/>
(class 1 wooden, range 75 - but my skill is constantly<br/>
improving) let me know. They&#39;re going Really cheap! (Mention<br/>
this message and I may just give &#39;em to ya.<br/>
LOL)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I look forward to meeting you all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May your<br/>
blade drip the blood of your enemies,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taniz</div>
