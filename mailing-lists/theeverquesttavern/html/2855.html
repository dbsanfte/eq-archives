<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140845587">&quot;To break it down into layman&#39;s terms, the game relies heavily on data <br/>
transfer between your PC and its server. Therefore, connection speed <br/>
is paramount. ;) Dial-up is one of the slowest connections you can <br/>
have (if you use AOL I pity you). &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks man. Believe me, I&#39;ve been wanting mom to switch to MSN for quite a while now, but no, she wants this easy **** that can&#39;t access quite a few things because it&#39;s cruddy ao****!<br/>

If you really want to spend the money, you could upgrade to DSL. It&#39;s <br/>
roughly about the same price you&#39;ll pay for AOL (depending on where <br/>
you get DSL from), or if you have Cable service available, get that. <br/>
Dial-up transfers up to 56K per second. DSL and Cable are 10 times <br/>
faster than that and more if you have a good modem and cable.<br/>
