<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488204654">Too bad you&#39;re not on Drinal. You sound like a<br/>
lot of fun to play with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Didn&#39;t read this<br/>
Xela&#39;s comments until I posted my previous message re<br/>
PowerPoint, but he makes some good points. I was one of those<br/>
that travelled to conventions back in the 1970s -- I<br/>
still have my programs from GenCon when it was still<br/>
run by Gygax and Company. That&#39;s what&#39;s so funny and<br/>
great about EQ -- it&#39;s like you never have to<br/>
coordinate with a DM or your friends to play. There&#39;s always<br/>
a DM available, and I can either find someone to<br/>
play with, or go solo. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yes, the roleplayig<br/>
aspect is an interesting angle, too - that says<br/>
something about us, but I&#39;m not sure what.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
