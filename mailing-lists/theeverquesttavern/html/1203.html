<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496217310">Hrm.. still prefer the autosplit of coins. I know<br/>
ppl tell me that you end up with more copper weighing<br/>
you down that way. But if you don&#39;t do that, it<br/>
becomes a matter of one person being honest enough or not<br/>
forgetful enough to keep count after every<br/>
loot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hrm... random alpha loot for nicer items? Ideally nice.<br/>
I can see it&#39;s benefits at higher levels for nicer<br/>
items. I&#39;m beginning to see that every method has its<br/>
flaws though. My concern is for every day loot though.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My level 9 spells are over 5 plat (I believe-- was<br/>
tired when I last checked). Every rusty weapon I loot<br/>
is an extra gold and an extra chance at<br/>
Blacksmithing early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh well... I guess if I&#39;m really<br/>
that concerned about money-- I&#39;ll just go and kill as<br/>
many bees as I can. I could probably make quite a bit<br/>
of plat each hour I do that. I just hate to kill in<br/>
newbie areas just b/c I need plat. They need the exp.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m not high enough to kill wisps yet, else I&#39;d do<br/>
that for the exp and lightstone&#39;s for plats.<br/>
Sigh/grin. Now that I know about that, I won&#39;t sell my light<br/>
stones to shop keepers and gls to players for 5 plat. =)<br/>
Seen the posts, figured that&#39;s what would be<br/>
suggested. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
