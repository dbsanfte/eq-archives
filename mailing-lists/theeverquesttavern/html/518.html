<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972312253">If I were you, I&#39;d go to Rivervale or Freeport<br/>
next, I&#39;m not too familiar with higpass and highkeep,<br/>
but I think most of the stuff there starts around<br/>
15th level, may be wrong though : )&lt;br&gt;To get there,<br/>
go from Qeynos hills to West Karana, as soon as you<br/>
enter WK take a right and run til you get to the shore.<br/>
Then follow the water for a very very long time.<br/>
You&#39;ll pass a stone bridge in NK, theres a bandit camp<br/>
pretty soon after the bridge so be carefull. Soon you&#39;ll<br/>
come to a wooden bridge, cross that and follow the<br/>
path to highpass hold. The path splits up, but theres<br/>
a marker to tell you which way to go. You can bind<br/>
anywhere in the highpass zones which is quite nice. The<br/>
run takes a while, but following the shore will make<br/>
it alot safer. A good idea might be to /ooc if<br/>
anyones running that way and ask if you can tag along,<br/>
theres always people making the freeport qeynos trip and<br/>
most are quite happy to help i find : ) If you do<br/>
decide to go further on to Rivervale or Freeport just be<br/>
careful not to go through Kithicor woods at night, its<br/>
rather nasty.&lt;br&gt;Have you tried Kerra Isle? Tons of exp<br/>
and loot there for someone your level and its not<br/>
usually crowded. Its the first stop for the qeynos<br/>
boat.&lt;br&gt;Well, this has been quite long winded hehe.. hope I<br/>
helped out a little : )</div>
