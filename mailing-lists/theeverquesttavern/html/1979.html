<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544999368">If you do want to play with 2 people you each<br/>
must have your account. You can only play one char at<br/>
a time on a account. If you try to play 2 the first<br/>
char that loged on will be kicked off. I have tried it<br/>
before. As for the ps2 I think its ok. I own a pc and a<br/>
ps2. I usually dont use my ps2 just my pc. Ps2 has ok<br/>
games but the X-Box(microsoft) and the<br/>
Gamecube(nintendo) are going to be comming out sometime in december.<br/>
There spose to be a good gamming systems to. Hope this<br/>
helps somewhat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ommuien&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ps. i would get<br/>
pc first then get a ps2</div>
