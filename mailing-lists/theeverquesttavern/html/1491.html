<b>Subject:</b> TWINKING-- a discussion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-729335549">OK-- I just wanted to bring this up, because I<br/>
just had a horrible experience involving twinking. I<br/>
play a lvl 20 druid, non-twinked, as my primary. My<br/>
ranger friend and I have been in HighPass Hold for 2<br/>
weeks now trying to get Dylln Starshine (or whatever<br/>
his name is), so I can get the last part in need for<br/>
the coveted Testament of Vanear. The only time we&#39;ve<br/>
ever seen him, he was already camped. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few<br/>
nights ago, i loged on (my ranger friend wasn&#39;t on),<br/>
when lo and behold, there he is!! There were only 7<br/>
people in the zone. I know I should have shouted that he<br/>
was up, and mine, but i was so excited that i memm-d<br/>
spells i needed, and went to find the nasty red bandit<br/>
guy, so I could harmonize him before i attacked. Found<br/>
the bandit, harmoed, came back, and there was a lvl<br/>
50 something guy stealing my camp. Turns out this<br/>
guy has 2 accounts, and had his alt char. there too<br/>
(lvl 5 druid) to get the Testament. I was angry that<br/>
my camp was stolen (though i blame myself for not<br/>
shouting ownership). But i was more frustrated that this<br/>
guy was there only to twink his lower charachter.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It reminded me of all the encounters i&#39;ve had with<br/>
twinkers, most of them bad. Twinkers often have little<br/>
respect for lower level chars, especially if they have<br/>
several high lvls and are just trying to power level this<br/>
new char. They, more often then regular players,<br/>
steal good mobs for XP. I&#39;ve grouped with twinkers,<br/>
unkowingly, who are godlike at the same level as me, while<br/>
the rest of us struggle. It may be sour grapes, but I<br/>
think it ruins the experience for others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now,<br/>
when I have a couple of lvl 50+ chars, maybe my tune<br/>
will change. If i decide to twink a char, though, to<br/>
power level, i&#39;ll make sure to stay out of REAL<br/>
players&#39; ways. I think it sucks for a lvl 50 to come in a<br/>
kill a quest mob and deprive the lower levels, for<br/>
which the quest is great, the opportunity. Also, i<br/>
watched a twinker come in to the camp i was in, wait till<br/>
some of us were dead or had to flee, and then jump<br/>
into the fray. When I re-zoned, i noticed that ALL of<br/>
the slain mobs, even the ones my group had killed,<br/>
had been looted. When my group got back to our camp,<br/>
the twinker denied our offer to join (said he was<br/>
power levelin and didn&#39;t want to share xp), and refused<br/>
to give up some of the loot that he &quot;stole&quot;<br/>
(taunting us with &quot;I&#39;m a master auctioneer, and this stuff<br/>
will sell great on the open marke&quot;) Some of our group<br/>
petitioned him, i just chalked it up to another bad player<br/>
experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SO-- what is your thinking on<br/>
twinking?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you do it? How severe? Do you twink your own<br/>
chars, friends, guildmates? Do you frown on twinkers or<br/>
admire them? Do you ever randomly twink a newbie just<br/>
because? (Now THAT I think is cool -- offering a lowbie<br/>
ONE higher item for doing a minor service) How<br/>
impressed are you with the playing ability of a lvl 5<br/>
warrior in full bronze armor?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;20th<br/>
