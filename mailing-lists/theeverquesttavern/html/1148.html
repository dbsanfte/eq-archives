<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229379569">Highhold Keep in the Warrior Room or the raider<br/>
Room. Usually there are full groups fighting in bothese<br/>
spots but you usually can get in pretty quick. Exp is<br/>
good there and it stays busy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SplitPaw in South<br/>
Karana is pretty good too. Pick up some fast and steady<br/>
Exp there along with a few scares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lesser<br/>
Feydark. Kithicor Forest. PermaFrost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want<br/>
to camp treants in SK, they drop pretty good plat<br/>
and some good Staffs from time to time.. At level 20<br/>
there is not much you can camp solo..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well Good<br/>
