<div id="ygrps-yiv-339107904">And that all I amega session of 20hours (no rest<br/>
for the wicked) &lt;br&gt;Since my main character has made<br/>
lvl9 and gotten his spells I have been playing a lot<br/>
more with him. First of because I can make easier<br/>
money of my tradeskill which is tailoring. I just sick<br/>
my lil pet at black wolves (actually soloed a Shadow<br/>
wolf once too) I can make about 2pp in one hunt of an<br/>
hour or so sometimes shorter and sometimes longer<br/>
cause I like to goof of ;-) and help the real newbies<br/>
lvl 1-3 that don&#39;t know where to hunt in Nektulos and<br/>
get killed all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well anyways I just<br/>
made lvl10 before logging the last session. And when I<br/>
started now I killed a darkweed snake in EC. the damn<br/>
poison killed me and I lost lvl10 again.&lt;br&gt; Then I<br/>
decided to go buy some armour as I needed some badly.<br/>
Bought a Bronze BP and helmet. And then spotted a shout<br/>
for and orc group. well to make a very long strory<br/>
short before I knew it it was 20hours later the guy who<br/>
gave the shout was still with me. In all we only took<br/>
an hour break from camping orc camp 2. So I really<br/>
only been in 2 parties Hey Xaiver and Zorbdan! yer the<br/>
best teamplayers I&#39;ve worked with so far!!! we<br/>
ruled!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And to top of my day i got a nice deal on bronze<br/>
greaves and got a tell in the mits of battle.. asking me<br/>
wath kind of weapon I used... and was given..... The<br/>
Reaper Of The Dead! and I love it baby.... if ya see me<br/>
