<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555816047">That&#39;s probably the quest that went along with the story line about <br/>
the plague in the Karanas, last year.  Farmers couldn&#39;t grow bread <br/>
and were starving, etc. . . Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but when <br/>
they fixed the plague, the quest went away, I think. <br/>
