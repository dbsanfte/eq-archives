<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938055213">The new Firiona Vie server is set up to be a<br/>
roleplay server. This may or MAY NOT be a good place to<br/>
start. It will be a good place to create and have fun<br/>
with a charachter you want to roleplay, but this is<br/>
not any easy place to be a new player. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On FV<br/>
there is no &quot;common&quot; language, and you start of<br/>
basically understanding only the language of your race.<br/>
This makes it difficult to travel at first, and to<br/>
communicate with others you may need/want to talk to. (ie. I<br/>
play a halfling on FV, and would love to buy some<br/>
enchanted jewelry, but don&#39;t know enough elf to make my<br/>
desires known-- lots of elven enchanters where I am, and<br/>
there are NO halfling enchanters-- darn!!).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, the ruleset on FV is very different from the<br/>
regular set, with limitations on shouting, auctioning,<br/>
looting, speaking, grouping, and getting experience. Also,<br/>
I think that FV is the only server where a<br/>
character takes on an alignment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Regular&quot; servers<br/>
(not including PvP ones) are more of a<br/>
community/social experience than a roleplay experience. If you<br/>
really are new, my suggestion would be to make a char.<br/>
on any other server to get a feel for the game. You<br/>
can then ask others specific questions and you&#39;ll<br/>
hopefully get some help. Then, when you&#39;ve gotten a hang of<br/>
it, you can switch over and make a char. on FV server<br/>
for some good old fashioned role play<br/>
fun!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>
