<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365295057">Warrens is a great place to hunt if you want to<br/>
keep good faction in borth Erudin and Paineel--<br/>
usually a factions raise in one, lowers another. Any one<br/>
hunt in Kerra Island?? I know the Erudites probably<br/>
love to kill the fuzzballs, but I&#39;m not sure if I<br/>
should. BTW -- if you kill that SK near the dock you get<br/>
great faction with the Mages of Erudin (espec. when you<br/>
turn in his bones), but if you do it more than once,<br/>
you&#39;ll need to pro&#39;lly kill LOTS of kobolds in Warrens<br/>
before you show your face again in Paineel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As<br/>
for Your Troll name -- have you simply tried &quot;Stan&quot;??<br/>
I would love to see that -- and then the surname<br/>
&quot;Lee&quot; to follow, or maybe &quot;Daman.&quot; I have a group of 3<br/>
friends and we&#39;re all going to start either trolls or<br/>
ogres -- can&#39;t wait to run over the hills toward the<br/>
orc lift in Kelethin shouting &quot;ME BASH DEM ELFSIS!!!&quot;<br/>
and see the newbies run and scream!!!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela<br/>
