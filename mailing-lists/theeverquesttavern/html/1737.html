<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039907654">I was hunting the other day and my tank pull 3<br/>
things. Thats ok, we can handle 3 things, but after my<br/>
first heal the other two agroed on me (that to be<br/>
expected). My tank, after i had called help 4 times let me<br/>
die. &lt;br&gt; I went though my invunerablity spells like<br/>
nothing. So after words me and my tank had a little talk.<br/>
How if he doesn&#39;t help me we all die. &lt;br&gt; The tank<br/>
said he knew what he was doing, but the creature he<br/>
was killing was almost dead. He though a cleric could<br/>
take 2 agroes.&lt;br&gt; After the little talking to I let<br/>
him out of the group. Mind this was not the first<br/>
time he did not releave the agroes of me.&lt;br&gt; Was i<br/>
justified in taking him out of my group. i would like to<br/>
hear your what you have to say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dark elf<br/>
cleric Fefelafuw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ps i hate hell lvls</div>
