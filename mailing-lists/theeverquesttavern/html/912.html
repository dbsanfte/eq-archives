<div id="ygrps-yiv-494142432">hey glad to be a member of the club. I live out<br/>
in the south pacific and I&#39;m getting the game by<br/>
mail in just a few days. (I hope tomorrow) I can&#39;t<br/>
wait to get started. Several of my friends back home<br/>
have the game and want me to get on-line so we start a<br/>
guild. My question is...Does the game really have enough<br/>
in it to keep you intrested. And for those who have<br/>
played a whole lot, do you find different and new things<br/>
each time you play? Well Hope to hear from everyone.<br/>
Thanks.&lt;br&gt; mark</div>
