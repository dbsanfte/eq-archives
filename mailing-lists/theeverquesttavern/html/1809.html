<div id="ygrps-yiv-613716473">&lt;Ah, yes, half elf druids are great, even if I<br/>
am as stupid as an unequipped wood elf<br/>
;)&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hmmmmm... not sure if a care much for this crack!!!<br/>
haha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;True-- there are TOO FEW quests for druids!!! I love<br/>
doing quests, and learned early on that i&#39;d have to do<br/>
other people&#39;s quests (ie. CB belts and pads) growing<br/>
up in Kelethin, if I wanted to do any. One good<br/>
thing about being a 1/2 elf is that you can start in<br/>
Surefall, where the quests are better (well, at least there<br/>
ARE quests there, other than a stupid &quot;go out and<br/>
fetch me some rusty weapons...haha stupid newbie!&quot;<br/>
quest). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OH-- I am still trying to complete the HE<br/>
cleric Symbol of Tunare quests-- have 3 ghast hearts<br/>
after about 30 kilss. Are druids SOOO powerful that<br/>
they don&#39;t deserve great quests at all<br/>
levels?????&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane &lt;br&gt;Druid of the 32d season&lt;br&gt;Leaving no<br/>
graves to defile--unless OT goons are about</div>
