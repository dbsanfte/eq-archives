<b>Subject:</b> Help needed on Video cards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699819643">Here is a question for the masses. I am looking<br/>
at 2 video cards. Voodoo 5 5500 and the Prophet II<br/>
which one is better. I currently have a ATI rager Fury<br/>
but I am wanting to upgrade. I am hoping someone out<br/>
there can help me. I am wanting one that has the most<br/>
memory but the most reliable. I also hear that Prophet<br/>
II Ultra is coming out. anyone heard anything on<br/>
this?&lt;br&gt; You can e-mail me if you wish, or post here.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Thanks Mark</div>
