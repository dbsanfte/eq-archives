<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-154744520">I was going on a raid of befallen with 2 friends<br/>
(I am a 21 druid, and I had a 22 wizzerdriss and a<br/>
20 rougess) As we entered this dungon we went to<br/>
meet our first oppent The dark elf Shadow Knight, He<br/>
hit me with his magic shot which droped me down to<br/>
9/10 health but a quick BS and Careless Lighting<br/>
finished him with ease. In luck he droped they key! We<br/>
made our way to the second floor and headed to the<br/>
Human Shadow Knight, we got the jump on her But a skele<br/>
decided to help, so as Wyly (rouge) was battling the SK,<br/>
me and Mylissa(wizard) finished the Skele with<br/>
little trouble. Wyly got 2 bs in while the Sk was slowly<br/>
being eaten away by my swarm. We then proceded to go to<br/>
see the Ugly Orge SK, not sure of the contents of<br/>
this room I put up a Shield of Barbs on all of us, we<br/>
entered, Wyly got hit hard for about 1/5 health, Then the<br/>
sk came over after a rather short time we dispatced<br/>
them with little ease, we check the orges corpse and<br/>
boom, Barbed arms, I&#39;m sure someone in the guild could<br/>
use these.... So we progress into the lower depths as<br/>
we beat ghoul after Willowisp, we get hit with the<br/>
worst thing that could happen in eq we all went LD at<br/>
once! we come back dead!&lt;br&gt;Remind me why I don&#39;t kill<br/>
GM&#39;s?</div>
