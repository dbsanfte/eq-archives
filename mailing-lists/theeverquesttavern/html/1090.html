<div id="ygrps-yiv-509800017">lol kegg... if you look at it this way, we<br/>
controll verant, rather than them controlling us in eq...<br/>
if everyone up and quit they would go belly up...<br/>
but this isnt gonna happen.. but if we could bring a<br/>
large enough number of costomers together whe could<br/>
posibly make a difference... or just piss them off,<br/>
either way we should get a reaction out of verant...</div>
