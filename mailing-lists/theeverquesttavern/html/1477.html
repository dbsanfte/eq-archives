<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343390820">This is an answer to your previous<br/>
post:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally I think EQ is more involved than any of the MUDs<br/>
I&#39;ve tried and the graphics blow me away. I always<br/>
tried to use my imagination when playing MUDs and it<br/>
really helped but now that I play EQ I don&#39;t have to<br/>
because anything I can think of for the game in my<br/>
imagination is already on it or on the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes you do<br/>
have to pay $10 a month for it but that comes with<br/>
over 20 servers to choose from, patches, equipment<br/>
saves, and a whole lot of fun. Most people that I&#39;ve run<br/>
into on my journeys have said that they would pay more<br/>
for what their getting because its so much fun. Plus<br/>
when you play as much as they do the price comes out<br/>
to less than 1 penny per hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well anyways<br/>
thats my 2 cents</div>
