<div id="ygrps-yiv-558920546">As always, shooman has sage advice. I&#39;ll add my<br/>
2cp worth here...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1ST-- play a race/class<br/>
combo that you like, and not just for stats. You will<br/>
make friends and be remembered if you are not just<br/>
another run of the mill barbarian warrior or halfling<br/>
druid. One thing people don&#39;t understand is that you<br/>
have to like your char or you&#39;ll get bored with it and<br/>
then you&#39;ve wasted all that time...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, Ogre<br/>
Warriors, Erudite Chanters and Halfling Druids are the best<br/>
combos Stat wise. I&#39;m not saying that any of them are<br/>
bad either-- Erudites start in a horrible newbie zone<br/>
(unless you go to painell/warrens), Ogres do too and have<br/>
faction problems. No complaints about 1/2ling druids at<br/>
all, except that you need to get out of Misty Thicket<br/>
ASAP if you want to make any cash and get into groups<br/>
at a young age. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go to Castersrealm.com for<br/>
some help on class/race issues and suggestions on<br/>
where to put points. They are not always right, IMO,<br/>
but they are helpful. Chanter INT 1st, CHA 2nd. Druid<br/>
WIS 1st and then maybe CHA (if you want to charm<br/>
animals a lot) or any melee stat. Warrior, depends on<br/>
what race you pick-- remember though, increased AGI<br/>
translates into AC, which means less hits and damage taken,<br/>
which means less need for healing, which means less<br/>
chance for clerics getting agro... etc etc... (Also, I<br/>
thought only Ogre Warriors had the &quot;not stun from the<br/>
front&quot; benefit??). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some fun combos of my<br/>
chars:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iksar Necro&lt;br&gt;DE Chanter&lt;br&gt;Wood Elf Druid&lt;br&gt;Dwarf<br/>
Rogue&lt;br&gt;Gnome Mage&lt;br&gt;Vah Shir Bard&lt;br&gt;Troll<br/>
Beastlord&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have fun with it-- be smart on where you put your<br/>
points and work toward stat increasing armor and any<br/>
class/race combo can be fun!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>
