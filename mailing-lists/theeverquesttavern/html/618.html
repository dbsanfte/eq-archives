<div id="ygrps-yiv-957424876">hey&lt;br&gt;i am in kelethin and i went over to the<br/>
emerald warriors guild, actually just wandered, and i<br/>
talked to an npc outside of the em war. guild he says<br/>
something about the cycle of life and how young warriors<br/>
hunt and collect food for the rest and then he says<br/>
something about shark meat. i asked him if i could get him<br/>
some shark meat and he gave me a bag to place shark<br/>
meat in and then combine it...he says if i do it i<br/>
will get a piercing weapon. does anyone know what<br/>
weapon it is? is it worth doing it? also, where could i<br/>
get shark meat??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks&lt;br&gt;Talrasha&lt;br&gt;Wizard<br/>
of the Veeshan</div>
