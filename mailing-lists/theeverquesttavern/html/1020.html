<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201332906">There is no tone in your voice my friend, BUT<br/>
there is a tone in your words, if you do not type them<br/>
correctly, people will take them wrong, I am not being nosy<br/>
by stepping in and commenting thankyou, I am<br/>
stepping in to give the assistance that was asked, My only<br/>
reason for saying there was no need to be rude was for<br/>
the lack of any other word possible and mainly<br/>
directed towards &quot;jackass&quot; although now, I&#39;m not quite<br/>
sure who&#39;s side I am on, because your words of &quot;nosy&quot;<br/>
is offensive we are all here to help each other and<br/>
with you telling me that I am nosy, it sounds like you<br/>
are saying that we are not here to help<br/>
everyone...&lt;br&gt;Myystical</div>
