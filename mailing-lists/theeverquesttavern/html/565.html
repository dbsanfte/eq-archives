<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845788904">I know a couple of these:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SoW stands for<br/>
Spirit of the Wolf, a shaman spell that enables you to<br/>
run like a jackrabbit. Chances are you&#39;ve had this<br/>
before - an icon of a boot surrounded by blue stuff<br/>
appears in a corner of your screen. It&#39;s a really good<br/>
spell, lets you run away from monsters and aids in<br/>
corpse retrieval.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When someone &quot;zones&quot;, the<br/>
person moves to a new zone. A zone is a region of the EQ<br/>
map. You know you enter one when you get that<br/>
&quot;LOADING...PLEASE WAIT&quot; message in your chat box and you didn&#39;t<br/>
fight anything. An example of two zones is North Qeynos<br/>
and South Qeynos. Zoning is pretty effective strategy<br/>
- if you&#39;re in a losing battle, go to the nearest<br/>
zone so you can run away - if you make it, the monster<br/>
will leave you alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for PoD and lego pad,<br/>
I have no idea - chances are someone else does.<br/>
Hope this helps!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;Warrior of 11<br/>
