<div id="ygrps-yiv-728004446">Hail, all, I&#39;m new here... I have a level 16<br/>
Barbarian Shaman and a level 17 Wood Elf Druid on the<br/>
Nameless Server. I&#39;ve enjoyed reading through the posts<br/>
here. I&#39;ve had to suspend my EQ account for a couple of<br/>
months and I&#39;m going through HORRIBLE EverQuest<br/>
withdrawals, lol (this should be remedied fairly soon, thank<br/>
God)! I&#39;ve been surfing EQ websites for an EQ fix, and<br/>
I ran across info on the new expansion that&#39;s due<br/>
at the end of the year; it seems really incredible.<br/>
The idea of Norrath having a habitable moon is really<br/>
terrific. Since I haven&#39;t been able to log on, I&#39;m<br/>
wondering what people are saying about it. Is there any<br/>
controversy? I haven&#39;t seen the subject discussed here and I&#39;m<br/>
wondering what you all think. Have you checked out the<br/>
screenshots and everything? If not, take a look-see at this<br/>
site:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/">http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/&lt;/a">http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the site:&lt;br&gt;&quot;EverQuest∩┐╜: The Shadows of Luclin∩┐╜,<br/>
projected to be available in December 2001, expands the<br/>
EverQuest universe yet again and is poised to provide some<br/>
mind blowing enhancements and additions to the current<br/>
game!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Eerie moonscape reveals over 25 new adventure zones<br/>
including a new starting city&lt;br&gt;*All new, highly detailed<br/>
player-character models&lt;br&gt;*Massively enhanced 3D graphics<br/>
engine&lt;br&gt;*Introducing an all-new player character race: The Vah Shir<br/>
(Kerrans)&lt;br&gt;*And an all-new player character class: The<br/>
Beastlord&lt;br&gt;*Additional non-level-based advancement options for those at<br/>
level 60&lt;br&gt;*Discover challenging new quests, items to<br/>
trade and sell, NPCs and more!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What&#39;s your<br/>
opinion on the new graphics that are to be implemented?<br/>
Do you think, as I do, that even though they are<br/>
much more detailed, that they look, hmm how should I<br/>
say this∩┐╜ more cartoon-like than the graphics we have<br/>
now? I&#39;m not sure if I like that∩┐╜ Do you like the<br/>
character models of the high elf and the gnome (the high<br/>
elf princess&#39; eyes are even blinking, wow!) I love<br/>
the idea of being able to personalize the faces of my<br/>
characters, and the Vah Shir sound really cool. Just<br/>
wondering what everyone is saying about all this<br/>
