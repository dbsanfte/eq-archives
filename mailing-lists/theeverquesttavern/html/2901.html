<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583576259">Well When I got Sk got married  I gave  the lady I was marrying  ingame the<br/>
ring that drops of one of the mobs on the top floor of Tower of Frozen<br/>
Shadow..  Heck since most of the peeps that were there were guildies  we<br/>
both got  stuff that we had been wanting to upgrade our characters. Had some<br/>
really nice stuff too for the level we were at at the time.  heck some of<br/>
the guildies had  everything Ineeded for my Sk&#39;s epic and  they MQ&#39;d it for<br/>
me for my wedding gift and then we went and  helped  my lady&#39;s char get her<br/>
stuff for her epic lOL was kinda fun seeing  a Sk and a Ranger in their mid<br/>
30&#39;s have their epics lol<br/>
<br/>
But if you are able to  and you&#39;ve heard your EQ Fiancee saying how much he<br/>
wants a particular item that would be a great wedding present.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

arrangement.<br/>
&gt; But what you do you get for a wedding present?<br/>
