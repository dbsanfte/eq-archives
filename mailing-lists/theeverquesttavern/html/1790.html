<div id="ygrps-yiv-3635680">Heh... been so busy lately. But I decided to<br/>
check in on this. Finally getting a chance. I know<br/>
there&#39;s a lot of stuff I probably wish I answered. But<br/>
this is the one I see and respond to. LOL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First<br/>
of all... typing in anger doesn&#39;t help. A few of the<br/>
responses-- like that lv 40+ cleric? I couldn&#39;t even<br/>
understand what you were saying. Run on sentences, typoes,<br/>
and two posts. Calm down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know what a tank<br/>
or a bard, etc that can&#39;t seem to get the group to<br/>
help feels like. Warriors as pure tanks, even lose<br/>
less exp when dying b/c they&#39;re EXPECTED to die a<br/>
lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Warriors-- tanks. Don&#39;t do much damage. Learn to<br/>
taunt, and bash. Dual wield is nice... but when against<br/>
a caster, switch to shield and bash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) When<br/>
down to 1 bubble of life-- there is no way to get the<br/>
mob to stop aggro on you. Just hope that casters med<br/>
up enough mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Yes, when in a party...<br/>
ya&#39;ll need to know your roles. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask<br/>
what classes there are. I always announce my class. If<br/>
no one else speaks up, I ask. Once I know classes, I<br/>
generally know my role. I am druid... so I have a lot of<br/>
roles. Sometimes, I am primary or secondary healer. I am<br/>
primarily a grouper so I specialized in Alteration.<br/>
Sometimes, I dot and nuke... etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Tanks have<br/>
different roles. Let me go over them. Those that can taunt.<br/>
From the instant you can taunt, when ever grouping or<br/>
not. Hit that taunt button. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warriors are<br/>
always tanks. Early on, they do a lot of damage.<br/>
However, middle to high levels -- they do squat compared<br/>
to casters and other melee&#39;s. But ya&#39;ll bash, and<br/>
tank insanely well. Some warriors expect to be damage<br/>
dealers. Don&#39;t worry. AC over Attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rogues,<br/>
Monks, and Rangers. Damage into insanity. Rogues do a<br/>
LOT of damage-- usually in good chunks and then good<br/>
quick spurts. Monks are constant pings of decent damage<br/>
that add up. Rangers are less so than these other two<br/>
but they can tank a lot better than Monks or<br/>
Rogues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Palys. I love these guys. Tank decently, good armor<br/>
range, good damge-- at least better than warriors by a<br/>
leap. Monks pull well with Safe Fall and Feign Death<br/>
and mend... but Palys, over all-- after battle...<br/>
they can keep themselves healed. And that LoH.<br/>
=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Note to all... I&#39;m biased. I come from a primarily<br/>
Paly, Cleric, and Druid based guild. Although lately,<br/>
we&#39;re getting more diverse. Just a bit weak on Raid<br/>
level experience).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Continued in next post...<br/>
said my post was too long)</div>
