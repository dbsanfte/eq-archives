<b>Subject:</b> Re: Where to hunt at 20 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-863472216">Thank you all for your input. I have currently<br/>
ventured back to South Karana to hunt some aviaks, lag is<br/>
much better and exp is good. This will only last me<br/>
till about 22 or so. I have a question about LOIO, I<br/>
earned 17-20 in kurns tower and wonder the best way to<br/>
get to LOIO? When we hunted in Kurns, we died twice<br/>
running through Forona Vie (sp?) to get there, is running<br/>
from spires easier? any suggestions?&lt;br&gt;BTW im on the<br/>
Povar server&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;Findella En&#39;Vocati 20th<br/>
yr wiz</div>
