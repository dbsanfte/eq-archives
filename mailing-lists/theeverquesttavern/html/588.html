<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134854180">If anyone has a character that they need help<br/>
with, I&#39;d be glad to do that in my spare time. Just as<br/>
long as you&#39;re on the Tunare server and I can reach<br/>
yas pretty easily. After all, being only of the 19th<br/>
means I can get to SOME places, but ah... I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
expect me to come help you fight in Nektulos or Grobb...<br/>
hehe. NOTE: I don&#39;t GIVE things away, not usually.<br/>
Buffs and Binds, yes. Teleports? ..Gonna have to wait<br/>
awhile before I get those. :) I will help with food<br/>
stuffs, spells, and hunting. But PLEASE don&#39;t think I&#39;ll<br/>
give up my Observer&#39;s just to help... I may be kind,<br/>
but kindness has it&#39;s limits, unfortunately... I<br/>
remember, a friend of mine donated 50pp to help out one of<br/>
his friend&#39;s characters. Needless to say, that<br/>
character wasn&#39;t seen again after that night... My friend<br/>
was pretty upset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; So... if your on the Tunare<br/>
server, look me up! Whether it be to ask for a possible<br/>
buff, bind, help with a SMALL quest, spells, etc. As<br/>
long as you ask nicely. I was helped out when I needed<br/>
it, it&#39;s time to repay the kindness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; See you<br/>
in Norrath!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ~Teppeny&lt;br&gt; Halfling Druid<br/>
