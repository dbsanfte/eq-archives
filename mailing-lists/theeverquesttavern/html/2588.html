<div id="ygrps-yiv-281766680">Don&#39;t overlook a few key spots in Dagnar&#39;s-- for instance, the gobbie <br/>
fort close to Unrest.  A few times when Unrest was too crowded or we <br/>
were sick of trains, we&#39;d head outside to this camp. Gobbies range in <br/>
level, and occasionally the Tidal Lord will spawn, which is great xp. <br/>
They drop some average loot, but they constantly drop arrows, so you <br/>
can load up there on the way to Unrest too.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of good places in old world-- some are out of the way, though, <br/>
and you might want to form your own group.  Najena, SolA, SK, High <br/>
Pass, Everfrost, Oasis, Upper Guk to name just a few.</div>
