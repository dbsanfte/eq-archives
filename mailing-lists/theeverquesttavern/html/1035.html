<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335607908">...I have a story to tell...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire<br/>
crackled as Bane cast a fresh log into its midst. He could<br/>
not keep it burning long, for to do so would bring<br/>
unwanted attention to his camp. He only sought the warmth<br/>
and comfort of the small blaze. It was another days<br/>
journey that would bring him to his destination. Knowing<br/>
the route he must take however, would make this trip<br/>
seem like ages. The deadly forest of Kithicor was the<br/>
center of many tales. Mostly of lost travelers, and<br/>
tortured souls. It is said that to enter this Cursed place<br/>
in the dead of night would assure you a place in the<br/>
afterlife. Bane scoffed at such superstition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He<br/>
traveled at night, as he felt most at ease within the<br/>
shadows. He had learned, from&lt;br&gt;an early age, how to walk<br/>
unseen and unheard within the darkness. It had save his<br/>
life on more than one occasion, that was<br/>
certain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the fire died down, he prepared to get at least<br/>
one hour of rest before continuing his travels. Fate<br/>
however, always seemed to have other plans. It was only<br/>
minutes later that Bane became astutely aware that he was<br/>
not alone.&lt;br&gt;He figured the best thing to do was to<br/>
remain completely motionless for as long as possible. At<br/>
first he thought that there were only two, but then he<br/>
realized his situation was much graver. There were four in<br/>
all...two to the east&lt;br&gt;and two to the north. By the sound<br/>
of it they were heavily armored and by the smell of<br/>
it they were goblins. Probably a scouting party. But<br/>
why so far from their lands? By the manner of their<br/>
movements he quickly determined that he was&lt;br&gt;still<br/>
undetected...this was his chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With one fluid, soundless<br/>
movement he rolled away from his camp and into the dark<br/>
shadow of a nearby tree. Held confidently within his<br/>
grip was the Deathbringer Rod. A grand weapon he<br/>
acquired months ago in a far off land. Though apparently<br/>
just a staff, this wooden&lt;br&gt;weapon did far more<br/>
damage than most razor sharp swords. The pure magical<br/>
energy used to craft this weapon, is the primary reason<br/>
it lives up to its name so well. Many have fallen to<br/>
its mighty wrath, and four more were about to join<br/>
their ranks.&lt;br&gt;As he sat motionless, poised for attack<br/>
the first goblin entered the clearing. It was far<br/>
from an impressive sight, actually quite<br/>
comical...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please feel free to add to this story. Always try to<br/>
keep the central characters in focus and the primary<br/>
story elements in place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have<br/>
fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Baneseeker&lt;br&gt;ShadowKnight with 29 years experience on the Tunare Server.</div>
