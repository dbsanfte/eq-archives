<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403034788">Just a reminder of some best BANG FOR YOUR BUCK<br/>
things in Norrath:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get your tailoring up and make<br/>
backpacks-- you can get at least 70pp for them, and they<br/>
usually sell pretty well in either Gfay or EComm (at<br/>
least on Xev)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spire groups in SK-- Gnolls are<br/>
fast action, so you&#39;ll get good XP, AND they often<br/>
drop plats for even full groups PLUS FS weapons (about<br/>
5pp each to merchant) AND Split Paw items. Most sell<br/>
for around 10pp at auction if you have time, EXCEPT<br/>
the gloves (which have wis and dex bonus) can sell<br/>
for around 20pp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MAMMYs in Everfrost!! This is<br/>
where I made ALL My money. Best if you are a ranger our<br/>
druid over lvl 20, but if not, get one of these to<br/>
group with you. I started at lvl 25 and it was tough<br/>
soloing them, but i could do it and get xp all the way to<br/>
lvl 30. Mammy&#39;s drop tusks, usually one, sometimes<br/>
none, but sometimes 2. After getting faction up in<br/>
Halas and finding the right merchant, I was selling<br/>
them for over 9pp each. They are huge and heavy, so I<br/>
would fill up, run to town, sell and gate back for more<br/>
action. Had several sessions making 100+ plat. If i had<br/>
teamed up with a cleric, chanter or tank, it would have<br/>
been faster XP, but I would have had to share the<br/>
tusks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the 30s, there is no better place that<br/>
Rathe Mountains hunting giants. As with the Mammys,<br/>
there is serious competition for mobs here, and lots of<br/>
high level soloers looking for easy cash. At level<br/>
30-38ish, this area can be challenging for a group, provide<br/>
good xp AND a TON of money. Full group can get up to<br/>
8pp each Plus FS weapons and the occasional<br/>
miscellaneous items. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kunark (LOIO, FM, OT) is one of<br/>
the best places for XP, but the loot there is<br/>
generally random, rare and terrible. BUT-- if you don&#39;t<br/>
like to auction stuff, then Kunark is the place to<br/>
hunt and be patient. When a Leg Chopper, Giant Tree<br/>
Flayer, or armor drops from the giants, go sell it<br/>
immediately to a merchant. The above items sell for over<br/>
30pp, with the large Foreman&#39;s tunic selling for 67pp<br/>
last i tried. Just gotta wade through all the tump<br/>
stumps---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok-- there&#39;s a little info-- I always forget to throw<br/>
in info for under 20s, because i can&#39;t remember what<br/>
GOOD mobs i fought then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela</div>
