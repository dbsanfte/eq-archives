<div id="ygrps-yiv-137538021">Ah, yes, the icky Mail question. Apparently, it<br/>
depends if you got an envelope, or a backpack. I _think_<br/>
the backpack toes to Ton Twostring, and the envelope<br/>
goes to Felisity Starbright. I could be wrong,<br/>
however. But I&#39;m pretty sure that mail goes to those<br/>
two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think you&#39;re safest giving it to Ton. Mail from<br/>
the Feerrott and Innothule Swamp, however, does go to<br/>
Felisity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ah, here are comments from two spoiler<br/>
sites:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not sure you CAN deliver mail to Felisity<br/>
STarbright in the bard guild in Freeport. I&#39;ve tried twice<br/>
now to give her mail from Idia in the bard&#39;s guild in<br/>
Kelethin and neither of the times have I gotten the<br/>
correct response, just the oh i don&#39;t know what to do<br/>
with this but thanks bit. Does anybody else have this<br/>
problem?&quot; (Yes, I&#39;ve messed that up.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this:<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Deliver all pouches of mail for Freeport to Ton Twostring<br/>
(he&#39;s the one that gives pouches of mail for other<br/>
cities). Deliver all letters for Freeport to Felisity<br/>
Starbright. This is regardless of what the NPC who gave the<br/>
mail told you to do. At least one NPC tells you the<br/>
wrong person to deliver to.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note the difference<br/>
-- pouches to to Ton, letters to Felisity. Good<br/>
luck, and let us know how it goes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
