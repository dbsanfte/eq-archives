<div id="ygrps-yiv-261902165">Most of what Kei said is correct. Two<br/>
corrections/adds though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Start losing Exp at level 5. I<br/>
don&#39;t believe you can lose the level 5 level though.<br/>
But you can lose exp at that level. So that&#39;s when<br/>
you want to stop dying. Grin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) You can lose<br/>
skill points IF you lose more than 2 levels. For<br/>
example, if you had a very bad luck streak-- went from<br/>
just inside 25 all the way to just under 23 (which<br/>
would really STINK btw)-- you would also go down to max<br/>
skill points you could have at level 24. (I believe. I<br/>
know you lose skill points though).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope that<br/>
clarifies. Again -- to reiterate...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Don&#39;t want to<br/>
die after level 5 b/c of exp loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Don&#39;t<br/>
want to lose two levels to dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>
out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic-- just hit 31 again! LOL.&lt;br&gt;Hopefully<br/>
I can keep it this time.</div>
