<b>Subject:</b> So where to go at 34? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-80120107">Hello all. It&#39;s been a bit of time since I last posted. Sorry for <br/>
that. Between school and works (yes that&#39;s three jobs in that works) <br/>
I have been a very busy person. But I have managed to squeeze in <br/>
some precious EQ time, so I am happy. Now my question is this. I am <br/>
presently lvl 32. I am a tick and a half away from 33 so in my mind <br/>
that&#39;s close enough to 34 for me. (LOL Math was never my best <br/>
subject as you can tell.) Anyway. I am currently in High Keep <br/>
getting my lvl&#39;s and as soon as I get 34 I am so out of there. The <br/>
only problem is...where? I have considered Sol A, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
if I want to go there if it is crowded or if it is empty. (What with <br/>
all the expansions and all.) So where to go at lvl 34 for an <br/>
Enchanter? Any suggestions?<br/>
