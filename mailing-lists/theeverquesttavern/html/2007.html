<b>Subject:</b> jewelry/tailor knowledge needed! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564338465">I am just starting out in trying to master the<br/>
skills of jewelry/tailoring. I have had a little luck<br/>
with the tailoring (swatches,thread, bandages, hell<br/>
even a wristband) but have had no such luck with the<br/>
jewelry skill. &lt;br&gt; I bought my silver bar then a<br/>
malachite & did my enchanted silver thing combined &<br/>
nothing~but this morning b4 heading in to work I tried again,<br/>
only using the plain bar (not enchanted) & combined<br/>
with another malachite & bam there was a ring! Not<br/>
worht a thing though cause it wasnt enchanted~will this<br/>
still help me to lvl in this skill?</div>
