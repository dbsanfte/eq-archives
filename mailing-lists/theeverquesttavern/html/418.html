<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131837483">Those aren&#39;t exactly the best stats for a druid,<br/>
but I know a friend who forgot to put his bonus<br/>
points into creating his half-elf druid (*cough* Athexx<br/>
*cough*) and did fine from levels 1-9. However, since a<br/>
druid is a spellcaster, the physical stats are of<br/>
neglegible importance except agility which determines how<br/>
often you get hit. A druid&#39;s mana comes from his wisdom<br/>
- the more wisdom a druid has, the more he/she can<br/>
cast.&lt;br&gt;Just my 2 cents, hope it helps =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Gilerrin<br/>
