<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756107958">Ahh the good ol reports... I usually hate doing<br/>
them but if its on something I like then its<br/>
fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just go up there and have fun doing your presentation<br/>
and putting it together... sometimes the simplest way<br/>
to go is always the best. As for handing out packets<br/>
and goodies; its a good idea but remember to keep<br/>
your audiences attention you should hold on to them<br/>
until your almost finished or they&#39;ll spend your<br/>
presentation time looking at all the stuff in the packet<br/>
instead of paying attention to you. I lost many audiences<br/>
by not doing this and I always got aggrivated when<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t listen to me because I handed out my<br/>
best part at the beginning.</div>
