<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-448643606">Woot is kinda short for &quot;WooHoo!!&quot; --Said in a<br/>
&quot;way to go,&quot; &quot;good job!,&quot; &quot;WOW!!&quot; kind of<br/>
context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your station name is rejected, that probably<br/>
means someone else has it. That is not the name of any<br/>
of your characters, it&#39;s just like an account ID.<br/>
Everyone has a Station Name and a password to access your<br/>
account. If you go to someone else&#39;s computer to log into<br/>
EQ, and type in your Station name and password,<br/>
you&#39;ll pull up your account. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weapons-- many<br/>
casters lament over weapons. Most people will say that<br/>
weapons don&#39;t even matter to casters. At low levels,<br/>
anything will do-- cracked staff is your best bet until<br/>
you&#39;re ready to hit magic MOBs, then you&#39;ll need a magic<br/>
staff or piercer. IMHO, 2HB weapons are a waste. There<br/>
are few 2HB weapons that will give you the stats you<br/>
can get carrying an item in your off hand (ie. Stien<br/>
of Maggok). Later in the game, you&#39;ll want to hold<br/>
to stat increasing items in your hands most likely,<br/>
and rarely switch to a weapon--UNLESS you get a great<br/>
stat increasing weapon. My suggestion, pick piercing<br/>
OR 1HB, grab a weapon and go. OH-- on Xev, you can<br/>
pick up a Dagger of Dropping for 5pp or less-- pretty<br/>
good lower level dagger, with a low lvl proc of<br/>
weakness, I think. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next item-- by &quot;clan,&quot; i think<br/>
you mean guild? Depending on your personality and<br/>
playstyle, you may get alot out of a guild. I liked the<br/>
soletary life w/o a guild for a long time-- but having<br/>
people in your head that you get to know over time is<br/>
pretty great. There are lots of bad guilds out there,<br/>
though-- takes a lot of work to make them fun and<br/>
prosperous-- good luck!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the<br/>
