<div id="ygrps-yiv-383972411">I don&#39;t know if I made it clear earlier but Evil<br/>
Races should use the Oasis raft BUT Good races should<br/>
use the Butcherblock rafts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is important<br/>
b/c then you don&#39;t need to worry about KOS. Another<br/>
reason this is important is b/c then you have a city to<br/>
bind in. If you die there.. you won&#39;t have to worry<br/>
about making the trip again. Just make sure to go get a<br/>
bind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OT has a city I believe for evil races (never been<br/>
there myself) for binds, and FV I know has a nice city<br/>
with a bank and all sorts of goods, great place for<br/>
Kunark binds. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wanted to make that clear. FV is<br/>
rough though... lots of big npc&#39;s and you want to try<br/>
following the lake edge to the river... and the river up<br/>
the waterfall till you can get to the Lake of Ill<br/>
Omen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>
