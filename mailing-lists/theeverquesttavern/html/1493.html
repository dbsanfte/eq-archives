<div id="ygrps-yiv-871305165">PowerPoint may be more hardcore than you need to<br/>
be for a 5-minute presentation, but here&#39;s what you<br/>
do. Take a screenshot in-game (the &quot;minus&quot; sign on<br/>
the keyboard), or steal one from the Sony Everquest<br/>
site. I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t mind too much -- free<br/>
publicity (since about half of your class will probably<br/>
want to start playing after this). The screenshots<br/>
will be saved in C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Everquest (I<br/>
think).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Double-click on a screenshot, and it will open in your default<br/>
graphics program (probably Paint if don&#39;t have anything<br/>
else). Go to File/Save As, and save it as a JPEG in a<br/>
folder that you&#39;ll remember. JPEGs are much smalled than<br/>
the 1 MB BMP files that Everquest screenshots<br/>
create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, open up PowerPoint and start a new Presentation.<br/>
Choose a nice background, but don&#39;t go for the fancy<br/>
ones -- dark backgrounds look cool, but sometimes<br/>
don&#39;t show up well on a projector. Simple is better.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Play around with the text -- use a gothic font or<br/>
something, perhaps. Then go to the folder where you saved<br/>
your JPEG screenshots. Simply click-and-drag the<br/>
screenshots you want to your PowerPoint presentation, and<br/>
they should (magically) appear in your presentation.<br/>
Or, you could do Edit/Insert and navigate to the<br/>
folder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d do more than two or maybe three<br/>
screenshots; create an outline for the first page of the<br/>
presentation, then talk about the game -- maybe screenshots of<br/>
characters to illustrate how they&#39;re created, and then a MoB<br/>
with some scenery. (Many of us would love to pose<br/>
in-game, I&#39;m sure; I&#39;m online usually after 10 p.m.<br/>
Pacific time if you want a model Dwarf . . . ) Then,<br/>
create a wrap-up slide (more text) for the last page to<br/>
sum up your presentation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps.<br/>
PowerPoint can be a beast, but lots of fun when you learn<br/>
it. Just remember that less is better, and too-fancy<br/>
graphics can overwhelm your audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sheesh, I was<br/>
still using construction paper and Elmer&#39;s glue at your<br/>
age, back in the days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>
