<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278270998">Hail, I was just wondering if anyone was gotten<br/>
the Fiery Avenger yet? I havn&#39;t even started the<br/>
quest(don&#39;t think I can, only lvl 9). I havn&#39;t played in more<br/>
than two weeks and it&#39;s driving me crazy. If anyone<br/>
wants to email me and tell me about how they&#39;re doing,<br/>
they&#39;re more than welcomed to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Withsedes</div>
