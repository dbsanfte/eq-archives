<div id="ygrps-yiv-699124056">Or if you have PoP then you can just go to the &quot;Overthere&quot; portal thing<br/>
and not worry about all that boat riding.<br/>

<br/>
i went to about 33 on my druid in highkeep too<br/>
i suggest you try the overthere and the fronteer mountians in kunark<br/>
you will have to take the big ship(the maidens voyage) from butcher<br/>
block to faronia vie then run to the lake of ill omen and then to<br/>
fronteer mountians then to the overthere<br/>
or get a druid or wiz port to the dreadlands and run from there<br/>
(the dreadlands is like a 45 to 50+ zone though so do be careful)<br/>
you will need to review maps of course<br/>
<br/>
if however you are of an evil race<br/>
you can take the bloated belly barge from the oasis of mar to an island<br/>
and then walk accross some rocks to a ogre outpost and take a broken<br/>
ship to the overthere outpost<br/>
<br/>
if you evil do go to faronia vie<br/>
if you are good do not go to the overthere outpost<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
if you like luclin you can still get some exp in marus  seru<br/>
and you can get groups dawnshroud pieks<br/>
a quick run from the nexus through neitherbain lare to ether one<br/>
<br/>
for many races though the wolves are a problem in dawnshroud<br/>
my wood elf druid seem to be amiable to most wolves but most other races<br/>
are kos to them<br/>
(i think they dont mind vah shir much ether)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
im almost done with my epic (excited)<br/>
we go for the dragon this saturday<br/>
<br/>
i think i have never talked on here much<br/>
but i do read it<br/>
<br/>
gratz on 34<br/>

  Hello all. It&#39;s been a bit of time since I last posted. Sorry for <br/>
  that. Between school and works (yes that&#39;s three jobs in that works) <br/>
  I have been a very busy person. But I have managed to squeeze in <br/>
  some precious EQ time, so I am happy. Now my question is this. I am <br/>
  presently lvl 32. I am a tick and a half away from 33 so in my mind <br/>
  that&#39;s close enough to 34 for me. (LOL Math was never my best <br/>
  subject as you can tell.) Anyway. I am currently in High Keep <br/>
  getting my lvl&#39;s and as soon as I get 34 I am so out of there. The <br/>
  only problem is...where? I have considered Sol A, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
  if I want to go there if it is crowded or if it is empty. (What with <br/>
  all the expansions and all.) So where to go at lvl 34 for an <br/>
  Enchanter? Any suggestions?<br/>
