<b>Subject:</b> Re: Question about bronze chain mail <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420052557">There is no such thing as bronze chain mail<br/>
armor, but there is bronze plate armor. On half elves<br/>
however the chain does look a brass color. If you want<br/>
bronze plate armor i think it comes from permafrost, but<br/>
at your level i would just try to buy it. Probably<br/>
just stick with banded at your level, a full suit<br/>
costs about 80pp. Good Luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Drentok,<br/>
