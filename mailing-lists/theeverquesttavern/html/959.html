<div id="ygrps-yiv-926500539">I&#39;d say level 25.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you get to Firiona,<br/>
once you leave the city, there are nasty spiders and<br/>
leeches that are pretty tough to me. Following the river,<br/>
you can zone in to the Lake of Ill Omen, which is<br/>
good hunting for 25-30.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are nearby zones<br/>
that are good hunting for up through the low 50s, but<br/>
I&#39;ll let you discover them yourself. They are always<br/>
one zone away from the one you just outgrew, or one<br/>
zone from Firiona.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy<br/>
hunting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar Alazeem&lt;br&gt;Half elf warrior of 41<br/>
