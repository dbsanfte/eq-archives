<b>Subject:</b> Harmony, clarity for druids? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241686661">One of my friends told me that he read somewhere<br/>
that if a druid casts harmony on themselves before<br/>
medding, the mana will go up faster, sort of like clarity<br/>
does. I&#39;ve tried it and it does seem to go up alot<br/>
faster, but I&#39;m not sure if this is just wishfull<br/>
thinking hehe. Does anyone know anything about this? I<br/>
guess i could time it, but that would be to easy :<br/>
