<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843613527">Sorry, this is an EverQuest mailing list and we have<br/>
nothing to do with any choices made by other<br/>
publishers.  Though we may at times stray from the<br/>
topic slightly, we do not try to get involved in other<br/>
peoples politics.  Best of luck in your endeavors. <br/>

P.S.  It is not wise to try to force your way into a<br/>
group of society that wishes nothing to do with you,<br/>
because it only provokes social anxiety.  My advise,<br/>
make your own mailing list and quit complaining about<br/>
what other people won&#39;t do for you.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; To:  The Salisbury Post, North Carolina <br/>
&gt; We, the undersigned, are outraged at the refusal of<br/>
&gt; a request to list <br/>
&gt; a Pagan/Wiccan Study Group - Magickal Moon in the<br/>
&gt; Salisbury Post, <br/>
&gt; which is located in Salisbury, North Carolina. The<br/>
&gt; reason given for <br/>
&gt; the request by the FAITH Copy Editor was both<br/>
&gt; ignorant and <br/>
&gt; discriminatory. &quot;The Salisbury Post FAITH section is<br/>
&gt; for people who <br/>
&gt; believe in God&quot; and &quot;this is not the image that The<br/>
&gt; Post wants to <br/>
&gt; portray.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Salisbury Post&#39;s mission statement says in part:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;We are a marketing and customer driven company<br/>
&gt; whose mission is to <br/>
&gt; inform, educate and entertain. We strive to mirror<br/>
&gt; the unique <br/>
&gt; communities we serve and offer responsible public<br/>
&gt; forum.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We fail to see how denying a Pagan/Wiccan study<br/>
&gt; group an equal space <br/>
&gt; with other congregations fulfills this mission<br/>
&gt; statement. The <br/>
&gt; decision was made with personal prejudices and not<br/>
&gt; handled with a <br/>
&gt; professional demeanor. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Regardless of whether or not Paganism is The<br/>
&gt; Salisbury Post&#39;s <br/>
&gt; religion, it is our religion. The Federal Government<br/>
&gt; recognizes <br/>
&gt; Paganism/Wicca, as an official religion. Military<br/>
&gt; Courts of Justice <br/>
&gt; in the U.S. have also found Wicca to be a valid<br/>
&gt; religion, deserving <br/>
&gt; of protection under the First Amendment of the U.S.<br/>
&gt; Constitution. In <br/>
&gt; the case United States v. Phillips, (42 M.J. 346) in<br/>
&gt; 1995) the <br/>
&gt; concurring opinion by Judge Wiss stated: &quot;First,<br/>
&gt; Wicca is a socially <br/>
&gt; recognized religion. It is acknowledged as such by<br/>
&gt; the Army. <br/>
&gt; See `Dept. of the Army (DA) Pamphlet 165-13-1,<br/>
&gt; Religious Requirements <br/>
&gt; and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook<br/>
&gt; for Chaplains&#39; <br/>
&gt; (April 1980), revising A Pamphlet 165-13, `Religious<br/>
&gt; Requirements and <br/>
&gt; Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for<br/>
&gt; Chaplains&#39; <br/>
&gt; (April 1978). Further, it is acknowledged as such in<br/>
&gt; courts of law.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pagans and Wiccans are a part of your community. We<br/>
&gt; are your <br/>
&gt; neighbors, your coworkers, your children&#39;s teachers;<br/>
&gt; we are <br/>
&gt; professionals, but most importantly we are your<br/>
&gt; readers - your <br/>
&gt; customers! As engraved on your building and<br/>
&gt; imprinted on the <br/>
&gt; Opinion/Editorial page of the paper &quot;The truth shall<br/>
&gt; make you free&quot;; <br/>
&gt; misconceptions about pagans, and being denied access<br/>
&gt; to public forum <br/>
&gt; makes it all the more difficult for the truth to<br/>
&gt; make any of us free. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Due to the fact that this request was handled in an<br/>
&gt; unprofessional <br/>
&gt; manner and with personal bigotry, we, the<br/>
&gt; undersigned, as well as <br/>
&gt; members of our family and friends, who are both of<br/>
&gt; the Christian and <br/>
&gt; Pagan faith will not support The Salisbury Post. We<br/>
&gt; will no longer be <br/>
&gt; a part of your readership until this matter is<br/>
&gt; reconciled with a <br/>
&gt; formal apology and the list is made public in The<br/>
&gt; Salisbury Post. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;We are not evil. We don&#39;t harm or seduce people. We<br/>
&gt; are not <br/>
&gt; dangerous. We are ordinary people like you. We have<br/>
&gt; families, jobs, <br/>
&gt; hopes, and dreams. We are not a cult. This religion<br/>
&gt; is not a joke. We <br/>
&gt; are not what you think we are from looking at T.V.<br/>
&gt; We are real. We <br/>
&gt; laugh, we cry. We are serious. We have a sense of<br/>
&gt; humor. You don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; have to be afraid of us. We don&#39;t want to convert<br/>
&gt; you. And please <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t try to convert us. Just give us the same right<br/>
&gt; we give you--to <br/>
&gt; live in peace. We are much more similar to you than<br/>
&gt; you think.&quot; - <br/>
&gt; Margot Adler <br/>

&gt; <br/>
