<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830337238">Ah, those focus items . . . I actually was in C-T<br/>
with a Mage who told us they were worth keeping and<br/>
selling. We killed so many crocs over two or three nights,<br/>
the entire party got a full set. I hung onto those<br/>
things for about three months, periodically auctioning<br/>
them in NFP. Finally, after I&#39;d blown all my cash,<br/>
literally, on a Crystal Grinder to upgrade my main weapon, I<br/>
sold them to a Gnome Mage for almost as much as I had<br/>
spent on the weapon. Happy day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry, your<br/>
mentioning those items just brought back a happy<br/>
memory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht</div>
