<div id="ygrps-yiv-673226589">Howdy all,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am Fatedhue (primarily) on<br/>
the Drinal server. I recently hit level 37 and if it<br/>
weren&#39;t for my guildmates, I would have maybe -- all of<br/>
128 wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to say, I don&#39;t think twink<br/>
is bad-- but as everyone-- I have a limit on what I<br/>
believe is fair twinking. There&#39;s something to be said<br/>
about making it over the &quot;hump&quot; but not to the point of<br/>
taking advantage of new players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And finally,<br/>
about 12 wis points ago (I&#39;m now at 139 or so)... I was<br/>
once told &quot;Did you mean to delete your character--<br/>
scrap all your equipment-- and then decide not<br/>
to?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The person was sincere and I didn&#39;t mind too much.<br/>
Hurt for a second though. LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhoo, trust me<br/>
on this one. Knowing the game isn&#39;t affected by<br/>
having or not having. I have a lot more now than before<br/>
but nowhere near 170+ wis or a couple hundred plat in<br/>
the bank. I have a ton of fun for the most part and<br/>
play a good group druid (forget kiting. I can&#39;t kite<br/>
worth piddling unless I have a chanter).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haven&#39;t<br/>
played this long without getting a ton of kudo&#39;s given<br/>
-- as well as lessons taken. MUCH taken.<br/>

mastering Baking *pout*... heh</div>
