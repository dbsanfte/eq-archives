<div id="ygrps-yiv-186062819">Hey hey everyone, this message board is working<br/>
great =) I&#39;ll tell ya a bit on my view of some of the<br/>
things posted recently hehe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First of all Yeah<br/>
the overcrowding on the servers is driving my nuts,<br/>
there really isn&#39;t any space for the high lvl players<br/>
anymore to hunt...since there are only 2 dungeons that<br/>
don&#39;t require hand picked raids to get any sort of exp<br/>
or items. It really would be nice if they put some<br/>
more servers up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you are fighting in fear<br/>
or hate just consider it that you are questing for<br/>
your personal goals. You are only acting in self<br/>
defense anyway since all the monsters will attack you no<br/>
matter what. All the items up there are too good to let<br/>
go anyway hehe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey zooper, I&#39;ve seen you<br/>
before in game. Mostly around the north ro region when<br/>
I&#39;m playing my troll Scabgut (who is twinky as<br/>
heck)...theres nothing wrong with twinking =P Even if you think<br/>
that now, you won&#39;t think about it<br/>
later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor &lt;The Aggressors&gt; 50th insane bard on<br/>
the Mithaniel Marr server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Famous Last Words:<br/>
It&#39;s only the Froglok King and four lvl 48 guards plus<br/>
others....I should be able to do this easy if the first one<br/>
doesn&#39;t resist!</div>
