<div id="ygrps-yiv-226770454">Stormfang is assuming you cancelled your<br/>
account.&lt;br&gt;Of course, I would assume the same thing, but there<br/>
is that slim chance that you didn&#39;t and you&#39;ve been<br/>
paying for it the whole time.&lt;br&gt;Are you trying to<br/>
register with the same Station Name?&lt;br&gt;Try using your old<br/>
station name and password, and if it still doesn&#39;t work,<br/>
contact Verant. Someone else is using your code... and<br/>
that means it&#39;s time to call out the Ogres on<br/>
someone&#39;s arse.</div>
