<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821462811">Here&#39;s the list of skills as far as I understand<br/>
them linked to their respective traits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Str-<br/>
weapon skills (1 hand blunt, piercing, etc.)&lt;br&gt; Dual<br/>
wield, double attack (backstabbing?) &lt;br&gt; Bash, Offense,<br/>
Riposte? Disarm?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sta- not linked to any skills, I<br/>
don&#39;t think&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dex- also none, I don&#39;t<br/>
think&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agi- (I think backstabbing goes here), Dodge, &lt;br&gt;<br/>
Evade, Defense, Riposte? Disarm?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wis- spell<br/>
abilities for wis casters (because it is higher than their<br/>
intelligence, hopefully)&lt;br&gt; Trade skills (smithing, brewing,<br/>
etc.) for any character*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Int- spell abilities<br/>
for int casters (because it is higher than their<br/>
wisdom, hopefully)&lt;br&gt; Trade skills (smithing, brewing,<br/>
etc.) for any character*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cha- singing and other<br/>
bard stuff, (methinks)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Trade skills look at<br/>
whichever is higher between Intelligence and Wisdom and use<br/>
that to level up in the respective trade skills. I&#39;ve<br/>
also heard that Wis/Int shows how fast you pick up<br/>
language skills from other players&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is gathered<br/>
from my own personal experimentation. I am unsure<br/>
where monk abilities (such as feign death or safe fall)<br/>
fit in, and I am also unsure of higher level warrior<br/>
stuff (Riposte and disarm). I can easily be proven<br/>
wrong, so feel free to get other people&#39;s<br/>
help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And don&#39;t feel too bad about not being the sharpest<br/>
crayon in the box, I have a base wisdom of 93 and I&#39;m<br/>
supposed to be a smart kinda priest caster. Sigh... I&#39;m so<br/>
terribly stupid, but I make up for it in<br/>
equipment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Tunare&#39;s Chosen of Karana&lt;br&gt;Chief<br/>
