<b>Subject:</b> What is a train? - asked by teenbeauty13 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-968045310">I believe a train is a long string of similar<br/>
monsters, most often &quot;pulled&quot; by a fighter who did not know<br/>
what they were getting into.&lt;br&gt;Example - let&#39;s say<br/>
you are fighting in the Blackburrow, home to the<br/>
wolf-like Gnolls. There are few humans around - it&#39;s a<br/>
gnoll-dominated place. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re fighting a gnoll that you<br/>
can beat. He may call a few gnoll friends of his to<br/>
help out. Pretty soon, there&#39;s a large number of<br/>
gnolls, so you decide to run. They chase after you in a<br/>
line, a &quot;train&quot; of sorts. This often happens when you<br/>
stumble into a den of monsters and run away. If you&#39;re<br/>
running away and see some players along the way, tell<br/>
them - &quot;run - train!&quot; - they should know what that<br/>
means. If you ever hear it, run with no question,<br/>
especially in rather difficult zones. Does this answer your<br/>
question? Sorry so lengthy.</div>
