<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142599455">The Ring of Combines can be found on a merchant<br/>
in Kelethin&#39;s druid guild. Seems that Tunare&#39;s<br/>
Champions have withheld the spell from gypsies and other<br/>
druid guilds. It is a level 24 spell, I think.&lt;br&gt;And<br/>
note: the dreadlands portal is safe. There are always a<br/>
few people hanging around it, and I have never seen a<br/>
monster near it when porting in. The iceclad ring is<br/>
another story...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Chief Druid<br/>
