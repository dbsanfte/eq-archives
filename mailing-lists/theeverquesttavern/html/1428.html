<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611757799">Alright, Most people have responded to this<br/>
already but I&#39;ll add what I know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rogue&#39;s hide<br/>
skill as well as all other&#39;s hide skill is treated as<br/>
an &quot;Invis&quot; spell. That is why &quot;See invisible&quot; will<br/>
pick up on Rogues sneaking around. (And why I always<br/>
have see invis up-- also lets me get Div sphere<br/>
up).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, especially at lower skills, I&#39;ve noticed that<br/>
sometimes Invis spells/Hide fail and you think you&#39;ve<br/>
succeeded. It becomes rarer as my skill went over oh... say<br/>
15 lol... but before that a few times I had issues.<br/>
(It&#39;s as rare as myself having a gate collapse instead<br/>
of gate me).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having said that, also-- always<br/>
con mobs. Animals can sometimes see through invis, as<br/>
well as higher levels may have it fail. Another thing,<br/>
especially with casters-- some of them cast random &quot;see<br/>
invisible&quot; spells on their allies or on themselves. And if<br/>
they hit you, your invis goes bye bye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These<br/>
are the results of my many experiences with Camo<br/>
(invis for druids), and Hide from Wood elf and<br/>
rogues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Correct me anyone if I&#39;m wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>

Concentrating after 2 years on one character is finally paying<br/>
off. LOL)</div>
