I only have like two or three of those.<br/>\n=/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Got a friend who had filled his whole bank and<br/>\ninventory with those things so he has like 17 or 18 of<br/>\nthose things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I&#39;ll fill my bank with those<br/>\nThurg toolboxes and carry tailored on myself.<br/>\nGrin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh... and btw. Here&#39;s an interesting lesser known piece<br/>\nof info about Harmony. Many druids still scoff at me<br/>\nfor this but...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harmony yourself at lower<br/>\nlevels. Then sit and watch your mana bar. It will fill up<br/>\nslightly faster than normal. It&#39;s by no means a Clarity or<br/>\neven a Breeze... but when you&#39;re a poor Druid watching<br/>\nyour tank dying-- wishing you could get off just one<br/>\nmore heal cause then ya&#39;ll could get him about 1 bub<br/>\nof health and taunt off the mobs...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah.<br/>\nThat&#39;s when I loved harmony the most at say level 5 to<br/>\n20 (although by 20 it was almost pointless) and<br/>\nespecially at Aviak city. I learned about the mana thing<br/>\nabout two years ago on a post on Everlore or something<br/>\nlike that. Got me curious and I tested it. Lo and<br/>\nbehold... I thought I noticed a difference. I could be<br/>\ncrazy but I still firmly believe I saw a difference. I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t tried it in so long though. =)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
