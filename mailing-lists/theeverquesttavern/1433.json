However, I thought it was just<br/>\nmy bad memory hitting. I thought I&#39;ve seen blue cons<br/>\nthat said &quot;quite formidable&quot;. They&#39;ve probably changed<br/>\na few things that guides haven&#39;t updated. But for<br/>\nthe most part--- that con guide&#39;s pretty good. I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t seen it anywhere online though. Where does it<br/>\ncome from?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, hide/sneak is supposed to work<br/>\nlike camo/invis. And as far as I can tell-- animals<br/>\ncan see through the hide/sneak/camo/invis sometimes<br/>\nfor some reason. It&#39;s almost as if they aren&#39;t as<br/>\naffected b/c of smell. I haven&#39;t noticed the affect as my<br/>\nlevel and skill in div went up though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep in<br/>\nmind that I only count Bears, and Lions in this mix.<br/>\nGriffs and other mytical animals I don&#39;t really count.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and yes. Con really helps. And as always, I<br/>\nrecommend-- go out to places that you like to kill, find a<br/>\ngroup. If possible, get the group to lead ya to the next<br/>\nbest spot to group and kill. Then you will find the<br/>\nnext spot to go to find groups -- which will then get<br/>\nyou more groups to lead to new spots.<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic Druid of the 29th (ooh<br/>\nI love&lt;br&gt;29th.
