Here&#39;s the scoop--<br/>\nOnce you leave the compound and head north-west,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll get to that water fall. Above the waterfall<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be following the river all the way to the zone.<br/>\nDrachnids infest the area, with an occasional gobbie or<br/>\nleech. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOST drachnids cannot see invis or rogue<br/>\nhide/sneak. But some can--- i have not figured out what<br/>\ndetermines this (ie. level of mob, or type of drachnid--<br/>\nthough i&#39;m pretty sure that I have /con all different<br/>\ntypes of Drachnids as indiff at one point or another).<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s the best way to do it-- head to the waterfall.<br/>\nMake sure you have SOW on and invis/camo up-- then<br/>\nbolt for it. You can either just run as fast as you<br/>\ncan and hope that if you DO agro something, you&#39;ll<br/>\nmake it to the zone in time, or you can move slowly<br/>\nand /con everything from a distance. The only problem<br/>\nwith this is that Drachnids have a nasty habit of just<br/>\npoping out of thin air. I have died once on the way to<br/>\nLOIO using either of these techniques. One time I<br/>\nagrod a Drach and got poisoned while running to zone--<br/>\nnearly died, but madly bound wounds till poison wore<br/>\noff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dreadlands is not a nice place for<br/>\nsomeone under lvl 35ish. I did this run several times<br/>\nwith my druid because I didn&#39;t want to boat to Kunark,<br/>\nand it freaked me out everytime. Best way to do this<br/>\nif you&#39;re foolish enough to try is to get SOW and<br/>\nLevitate-- if you run from the snow capped mountains and<br/>\nhead 1) east toward Karnor&#39;s or 2) North-East to the<br/>\nnorthern wall, you will probably not agro anything from<br/>\nyour height in the sky. If you do, you can get help<br/>\nfrom the groups at Karnor&#39;s or the surrounding ruins.<br/>\nIf you headed north, you can zone to BW or FM.<br/>\nThat&#39;s the easy part, now you need to make your way<br/>\neither to the FM zone and then dodge giants to the LOIO<br/>\nzone, or you have to get to the FV zone and STILL run<br/>\nthe guantlet from FV to LOIO. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most things in<br/>\nDL see through invis-- including giants (same ones<br/>\nas in FM). I think more Drachnids in DL see through<br/>\ninvis, and they are mostly higher levels that those in<br/>\nFV. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My god, I should wrap this up now...<br/>\nhehe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck-- the dangerous run is there because the<br/>\nrewards of xp in LOIO are soo good. On Xev LOIO is full<br/>\nof /shout /ooc spam-- it seems more like a chat room<br/>\nat times than a game, but you get to know a lot of<br/>\nplayers there, and if you&#39;re smart, you&#39;ll /friend so you<br/>\ncan hook up at higher levels for better adventures!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
