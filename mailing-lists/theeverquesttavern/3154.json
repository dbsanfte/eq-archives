Thankfully I follow rules, laws, and try to do <br/>\nmy best in life so no worries! The teacher/parent meeting let me know <br/>\nmy son was above his class. He&#39;s at the level now in the first of <br/>\nthree trimesters that he should be by the end of the year. Today he <br/>\nbrought home another award, I&#39;m sure he has all 4 &quot;As&quot; so I&#39;ll owe <br/>\nhim $20, and he&#39;s behaving very well. With his award he gets his <br/>\npicture taken and put on a local restaurants wall as well as a free <br/>\ndinner.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI make it a point to frame and hang Vincent&#39;s awards and achievements <br/>\nso he&#39;s driven to do his best and aime high in life. At the same time <br/>\nthe few times he does see his dad it helps to keep his self-esteem <br/>\nhigh when his father does something to lower it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are one step closer to our family goals!! We want to buy a 4 <br/>\nbedroom house. My fianc├⌐ will have his own computer room, privacy, <br/>\nand can do basically what he wants with his space. Vincent was <br/>\npromised a dog when we get a house and I hope he keeps up with <br/>\ncleaning up after it, feeding it, and making sure it has water. I on <br/>\nthe other hand only care about having a big kitchen with a center <br/>\nisland. Plus, we still have to think about our goals to get married, <br/>\nthe dress will probably be the highest price tag. The photographer, <br/>\nvideo, church, flowers, his tuxedo, my son&#39;s little tuxedo, and <br/>\nplenty food.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t Quit <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen things go wrong and they sometimes will, <br/>\nWhen the road you&#39;re trudging seems all uphill, <br/>\nWhen funds are low and debts are high, <br/>\nAnd you want to smile but only sigh, <br/>\nWhen care is pressing you down a bit, <br/>\nRest if you must, but don&#39;t you quit. <br/>\n<br/>\nLife is strange with its twists and turns, <br/>\nAs every one of us sometimes learns, <br/>\nAnd many a failure turns about, <br/>\nWhen he might have won had he stuck it out, <br/>\nDon&#39;t give up though the pace seems slow, <br/>\nYou may succeed with another blow. <br/>\n<br/>\nSuccess is failure turned inside out, <br/>\nThe silver tint of the clouds of doubt, <br/>\nAnd you can never tell how close you are, <br/>\nIt seems so near when it seems so far; <br/>\nSo stick to the fight when hardest hit, <br/>\nIt&#39;s when things go wrong that you must not quit.<br/>\n_________________<br/>\n~*~Beverly R.~*~ <br/>\nP.O.
