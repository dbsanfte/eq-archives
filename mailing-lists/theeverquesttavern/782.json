Even if he is blinded the<br/>\npally could target and bash the skelly to pieces and<br/>\nthen target teh necro and turn on auto attack (If<br/>\nnecro is hitting pally, and pally is not hitting necro<br/>\npally is facing wrong dirction) and start casting his<br/>\nspells. I am not saying the pally would win, but if the<br/>\nnecro wasn&#39;t careful an experianced pally could do<br/>\nmajor harm. Of course the necro has Shadow Step up his<br/>\nsleve in case things get nasty... as long as he rembers<br/>\nnot to burn out all his mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pirotes&lt;br&gt;DE<br/>\nWarrior&lt;br&gt;Mith.
