I was leading my groupmate through the South<br/>\ndeasert of Ro, when i see him go down a steeper hill and<br/>\ntake just enough to kill him...&lt;br&gt;The next thing on<br/>\nmy screen is a message that says &quot;You have slain<br/>\n*****!&quot;(i wont say the name) &quot;your faction with most humans<br/>\nhas gone down!&quot; My mouth drops 10 feet irl, i rushed<br/>\nback to freeport to the Ikthars armor to check the<br/>\nprice on plate. AGH what do you mean 300pp for a plate<br/>\nbracer?!?!?! i bought it for 266. So i sat around for 2 days<br/>\nuntill a GM actually got to me. After checking for about<br/>\n15 min, The GM told me that there was no way for him<br/>\nor me to change my faction back, and just saying he<br/>\nwould log it as a bug! So basically i put 15 points<br/>\ninto my starting charisma for nothing. I think thats<br/>\nbadly designed because a group member could be<br/>\nauto-following you without you knowing it. Sure the follower<br/>\ngets a message saying the y might fall in pits, but<br/>\nthey dont loose any exp! In my opinion the real danger<br/>\nis to the leader, if you have a weak member and<br/>\nunsteady factions this could ruin you character. I felt i<br/>\nhad to warn as many people as possible aobut this.<br/>\nHave any ideas on helping my faction or have opinions<br/>\non the subject please post a message.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin<br/>\nDanmor, 28th League Standing, Minstrel of Norrath.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
