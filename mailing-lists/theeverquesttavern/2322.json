Due to illegal actions<br/>\nupon myself, I am under investigation by Verant. This<br/>\nhas caused me great distress because I have been<br/>\naccused of many things that I did not do. I am under<br/>\ninvestigation for only 3 months, and then they will decide if<br/>\nmy actions were bad enough to boot me from the<br/>\nprogram... Here&#39;s my deal to you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\tYou may send me<br/>\nyour Station Name and Password to my email address,<br/>\nalong with the server you are playing on, and I will<br/>\ngive all your characters what I see fit. If you like,<br/>\nyou may include an exact list of what you want put on<br/>\nthis character...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\tNow, I know this may sound<br/>\ntoo good to be true, but Verant has really pissed me<br/>\noff this time, and I will be booted in 3 months<br/>\nanyway... You don&#39;t have much time to waste... Please Email<br/>\nme at this address, and I will accomplish what I&#39;ve<br/>\nalways wanted to do... Get back at Verant, along with<br/>\nyou, getting the best things in the game for free...<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t matter much to me, but if you want to be uber,<br/>\nfollow my directions,,,, It&#39;ll be done within the<br/>\nnight.... Being, and having a GM character, I can switch<br/>\nfrom server to server, so this can apply to<br/>\nEVERYONE...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for you support in my<br/>\nendeavour....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asst.
