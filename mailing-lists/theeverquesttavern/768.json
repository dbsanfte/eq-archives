I didn&#39;t like my Human<br/>\nNecro that much, mainley because he was in Qeynos.. I<br/>\ncan live.. (well die most of the time) with all the<br/>\nKOS you get but the city lacked appeal from the Necro<br/>\npoint of view. Let&#39;s face it crawling around sewers<br/>\njust isn&#39;t my style. Also I just can&#39;t find a real<br/>\naffinety with the Bertoxxulous deity making roleplay a big<br/>\nno no. &lt;br&gt;So I decieded to delete the character and<br/>\ncreate a new one, this time in Freeport following<br/>\nInnoruuk... So far nothing to funny right? :) Well the first<br/>\nthing I did was NOT going to look up my guild, but<br/>\ngoing to Nektulos. I didn&#39;t encounter any bears or<br/>\nskellies on my way thank Innoruuk, and made it al the way<br/>\nto the city. Guards conned my Dubiosly.&lt;br&gt;So I<br/>\ndecieded to go inside and see How far I could go. To my<br/>\nsuprice i could go all the way to 3th gate. The only ones<br/>\nnot liking me where the Ghouls at the entrance of the<br/>\nlodge of the dead. &lt;br&gt;So I had to make some money and<br/>\nask somebody to buy the spell Invis. VS Undead for<br/>\nme... Which nobody wanted to do because I was Human...<br/>\n(normally they never roleplay but if I need a favor they<br/>\nsuddendly ALL do). So i logged of and back on as my main<br/>\nchar. Yargon, DE SK. I asked around through the guild<br/>\nchannel this time and after A litle while got somebody to<br/>\nhelp. I bought a cracked staff and the first lvl spells<br/>\nput them in a backpack and had them given to My newby<br/>\nNecro Nebulos. I also had secured a bind in the city in<br/>\nthe mean time.&lt;br&gt;And I must say it&#39;s been a blast..<br/>\nI hardly have come around to some leveling because<br/>\nI got to answer questions all the time... &quot;Taught<br/>\nhumans where KOS here?&quot;and stuff like that :)&lt;br&gt;Yup it<br/>\nfeels nice being a litle uniqe in the EQ world :P I<br/>\nknow most have nevert seen a naked lvl1 necro running<br/>\naround in Nektulos before :P</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
