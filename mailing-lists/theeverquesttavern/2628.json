I went to the comp shop I was telling <br/>\nya&#39;ll about. They&#39;ve got some decent prices on computer components, <br/>\nbut they don&#39;t sell complete systems. I guess this is good since I <br/>\nonly want a new motherboard and chip. (I also have to but a case as <br/>\nthey won&#39;t install anything that isn&#39;t theirs, ie. their motherboard <br/>\nand chip into my case with my hard drive etc,.)  I am looking at <br/>\nabout $200.00-$230.00, but I will also be selling them my case and <br/>\nold mother board and chip so that price may go down about say $50.00? <br/>\nAnyway I told them that I would be back in in four weeks to get <br/>\neverything, so keep your fingers crossed for me ok? (The reason for <br/>\nfour weeks is that rent is due in two weeks, so I&#39;ll have to wait <br/>\ntill after rent.) The Raven<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I can&#39;t remember who had asked me to call EQ about my account. <br/>\nAt this moment I am not too worried if my characters are wiped out. <br/>\nRight now I just want to play the game! And yes I am still being <br/>\ncharged monthly for the game. Since my c/c is a debit card I can see <br/>\nif it is being charged, and it is.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
