And <br/>\nwe chewed on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets, and <br/>\nwhen we rode our bikes, we had no helmets. (Not to mention the risks <br/>\nwe took hitchhiking.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags.<br/>\n<br/>\nRiding in the back of a pickup truck on a warm day was always a <br/>\nspecial treat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle. Horrors!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ate cupcakes, bread and butter, and drank soda pop with sugar in <br/>\nit, but we were never overweight because we were always outside <br/>\nplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle, and no <br/>\none actually died from this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then <br/>\nrode down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After <br/>\nrunning into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we <br/>\nwere back when the streetlights came on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one was able to reach us all day. No cell phones. Unthinkable! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe did not have Play Station, Nintendo 64, X-Boxes, no video games at <br/>\nall, no 99 channels on  cable, videotape movies, surround sound, <br/>\npersonal cell phones, personal computers, or Internet chat rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had friends! We went outside and found them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played dodge ball, and sometimes, the ball would really hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe fell out of trees, got cut and broke bones and teeth, and there <br/>\nwere no lawsuits from these accidents. They were accidents. No one <br/>\nwas to blame but us. Remember accidents?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had fights and punched each other and got black and blue and <br/>\nlearned to get over it, and all it took was an &quot;I&#39;m Sorry&quot; to make it <br/>\nall better.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe made up games with sticks and tennis balls and ate worms, and <br/>\nalthough we were told it would happen, we did not put out very many <br/>\neyes, nor did the worms live inside us forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe rode bikes or walked to a friend&#39;s home and knocked on the door, <br/>\nor rang the bell or just walked in and talked to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who <br/>\ndidn&#39;t had to learn to deal with disappointment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome students weren&#39;t as smart as others, so they failed a grade and <br/>\nwere held back to repeat the same grade. Horrors! Tests were not <br/>\nadjusted for any reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur actions were our own. Consequences were expected, no one to hide <br/>\nbehind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. <br/>\nThey actually sided with the law. Imagine that!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem <br/>\nsolvers and inventors, ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. <br/>\nWe had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned <br/>\nhow to deal with it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you&#39;re one of them. Congratulations!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease pass this on to others who have had the luck to grow up as <br/>\nkids, before lawyers and government regulated our lives, for our own <br/>\ngood.<br/>\n<br/>\n._.-~*~-.Beverly R.-~*~-._.-~*~-._<br/>\n <br/>\nP.O.
