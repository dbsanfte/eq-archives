There aren&#39;t enough dwarven healers in the game,<br/>\nthey&#39;re really underrated and really good. Your first<br/>\ncharacter should be a warrior, again, so you can learn the<br/>\ncombat system.

The number of people on a<br/>\nserver affects lag time, so if you&#39;re worried about lag<br/>\njoin a server with a few amount of people during peak<br/>\ntime (equivalent to primetime in TV land). But these<br/>\nservers generally have younger characters with less<br/>\nexperience than others. The older servers - Fennin Ro and<br/>\nVeeshan especially - tend to have the worst lag but the<br/>\nmost serious players. Pick whatever you want.<br/>\nPersonally I like Prexus - medium lag and medium level of<br/>\nseriousness. But it&#39;s your choice.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
