I actually am only wearing legs and shoes that<br/>\nare truly leather (banded actually... I&#39;m a tailor<br/>\nand made them myself).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot of my wisdom<br/>\nitems were givien to me by some friends who like to<br/>\nhang out at the EC tunnel, and they do pretty well<br/>\nthere. Not my cup of tea tho. I&#39;m not up on how much<br/>\nstuff goes for, but you can check it on<br/>\n&lt;a href=http://www.eqprices.com target=new&gt;http://www.eqprices.com&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve found them to be pretty<br/>\naccurate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a black medallion (not the exact name... like I<br/>\nsaid, I&#39;m NOT a equipment junkie) that you should be<br/>\nable to get. If you can find a jeweler, jasper is our<br/>\ngem of choice... that&#39;s the one that increases<br/>\nwisdom. If you show up with a silver bar and a jasper,<br/>\nmost jewelers will give you a heavy discount, maybe<br/>\neven free. Just remember fizzles happen, and you might<br/>\nlose it if he fizzles.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
