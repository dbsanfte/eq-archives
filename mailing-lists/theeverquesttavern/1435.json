My friend<br/>\nhas that guide book, and it helps out alot in finding<br/>\ngood kills for good exp. While tarvelling around in<br/>\nthe pit in the Field of Bone on Kunark, I looked back<br/>\non the /con guide to help pick out those better of<br/>\nthe blue scalebone skeletons. Still I&#39;d rather take<br/>\nthe risk and fight white&#39;s or even yellow&#39;s. So far,<br/>\nusing the /con guide, I&#39;ve filled 3 bubbles in around 2<br/>\nhours, which I&#39;d say isn&#39;t too shabby. I DID start a new<br/>\ncharacter and get him to level 9 in around a week.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of griffs. I started a Dark Elf a while back and<br/>\nwanted to start my levelling in Freeport, and on my way<br/>\nblocking the trail was a griffon. I couldn&#39;t go around,<br/>\nsince there were higher level orc&#39;s scouting the place,<br/>\nso I just thought, what the hell, and darted<br/>\nthrough. I guess them griff&#39;s like me because it just kept<br/>\nhovering in that same spot and never spotted me.<br/>\nUnfortunately, the guy behind me wasn&#39;t as<br/>\nlucky....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xythe of the 9th Level&lt;br&gt;Iksar Shadow<br/>\nKnight&lt;br&gt;Vazaelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
