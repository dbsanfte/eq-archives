The expansion for Everquest, Raid<br/>\non Kunark, will be out this March! I have been<br/>\nwaiting for sooooooooo long! I have tons of info on the<br/>\nexpansion, so if you are curious just ask me. It will have a<br/>\nnew continent in the south called Kunark. On that<br/>\ncontinent and that continent alone there will be 20+ new<br/>\nzones, better graphics, and new quests and items! They<br/>\nhave decided not to add to the original continents (or<br/>\nat least not much)...so you won&#39;t be seing new parts<br/>\nto your favorite areas. There will be a new<br/>\nrace...Ikthar, that will be big Dino/Lizzies...very cool<br/>\nlookin&#39;...ask me any questions...I might just be able to<br/>\nanswer. =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
