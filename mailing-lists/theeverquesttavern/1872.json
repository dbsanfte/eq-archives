If they feel<br/>\nbetter by having better stuff, then I think they are<br/>\njust compensating for inadequecy. If they use their<br/>\ntwinkings for the good of the group, then I am good with<br/>\nit. I think that powerleveling is more disruptive<br/>\nthan twinking. When you get a level 20 warrior that<br/>\ncan&#39;t taunt, or a cleric that doesn&#39;t know about<br/>\ncertain beneficial spells (stun and fear come to mind) or<br/>\na bard that is still singing the level 1 song (or<br/>\nbetter yet, never bought any), then you find yourself<br/>\ngetting killed because of idiocy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
