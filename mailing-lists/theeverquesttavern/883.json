Race doesn&#39;t really matter.<br/>\nWarriors are fairly straight-forward to play. Once you get<br/>\nthe hang of the menus, combat, the chat channels,<br/>\netc. you may want to change classes. If you want to<br/>\nexperiment with a casting class you could try a Druid or<br/>\nNecro. They both have a wide variety of spells. Playing<br/>\nthem up to level 5 should give you an idea of what you<br/>\nlike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After playing these, ask yourself:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do I want to<br/>\nbe offensive or defensive?&lt;br&gt;Do I plan on soloing<br/>\n(playing alone) a lot or grouping mostly?&lt;br&gt;Do I prefer<br/>\nto cast spells, melee, or some<br/>\ncombination?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you get used to the game mechanics and can answer<br/>\nthose questions, come back and ask us what class suits<br/>\nyou best...if you haven&#39;t already found one you like<br/>\n:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar<br/>\nMirraghost&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
