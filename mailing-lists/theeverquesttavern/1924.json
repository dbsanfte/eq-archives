That is not the name of any<br/>\nof your characters, it&#39;s just like an account ID.<br/>\nEveryone has a Station Name and a password to access your<br/>\naccount. If you go to someone else&#39;s computer to log into<br/>\nEQ, and type in your Station name and password,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll pull up your account. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weapons-- many<br/>\ncasters lament over weapons. Most people will say that<br/>\nweapons don&#39;t even matter to casters. At low levels,<br/>\nanything will do-- cracked staff is your best bet until<br/>\nyou&#39;re ready to hit magic MOBs, then you&#39;ll need a magic<br/>\nstaff or piercer. IMHO, 2HB weapons are a waste. There<br/>\nare few 2HB weapons that will give you the stats you<br/>\ncan get carrying an item in your off hand (ie. Stien<br/>\nof Maggok). Later in the game, you&#39;ll want to hold<br/>\nto stat increasing items in your hands most likely,<br/>\nand rarely switch to a weapon--UNLESS you get a great<br/>\nstat increasing weapon. My suggestion, pick piercing<br/>\nOR 1HB, grab a weapon and go. OH-- on Xev, you can<br/>\npick up a Dagger of Dropping for 5pp or less-- pretty<br/>\ngood lower level dagger, with a low lvl proc of<br/>\nweakness, I think. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next item-- by &quot;clan,&quot; i think<br/>\nyou mean guild? Depending on your personality and<br/>\nplaystyle, you may get alot out of a guild. I liked the<br/>\nsoletary life w/o a guild for a long time-- but having<br/>\npeople in your head that you get to know over time is<br/>\npretty great. There are lots of bad guilds out there,<br/>\nthough-- takes a lot of work to make them fun and<br/>\nprosperous-- good luck!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the<br/>\n35th Season&lt;br&gt;Defenders of Mithril<br/>\nHall&lt;br&gt;Xev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I have too much time on my hands&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
