I managed to go from 1-9 in the<br/>\nswamp and grobb and now I&#39;m in EC. I had an ogre friend<br/>\nescort over the dunes of North Ro and Oasis to get to<br/>\nthe EC and the tunnel. We continued on through to the<br/>\nNek forest to get to the foreign quarter of Neriak. I<br/>\nam bound there. FQ is good because I can hunt in EC<br/>\n(camp the orc camps) or solo in nek forest and then<br/>\nsell to DEs in FQ. I&#39;m rapidly approaching a<br/>\ncrossroads. I&#39;ve been reading around about how WC and it&#39;s<br/>\nwisps can be lucrative but all the NPCs (hihglevel<br/>\nspawns) seem very dangerous. Another option might be the<br/>\nlavastorm mts. Two questions. Once I hit 14th level and I<br/>\nneed to get my spells (remember I am a shaman) I have<br/>\nto go back to the swamp to get them? Should I try to<br/>\nbuy a teleport? I&#39;m really looking forward to bind so<br/>\nI can venture further. Another question is what<br/>\nwould be a better spot to lvl 12 up, WC or Lava MTs?<br/>\nWhat I really need is a bud to teleport me back to<br/>\ngrobb to get my 14th level spells. Appreciate any<br/>\nadvice veteran players have. More questions: I am<br/>\nfrequently encumbered by my banded armor I heard someone<br/>\ntalk on another forum about a minthril tunic and gator<br/>\nlegs. Should I stick with all my banded and loot less<br/>\ntrash. I usually just gate to neriak to dump the trash<br/>\nanyway. Despite the tunnel&#39;s proximity I&#39;m a sitting duck<br/>\nrunning through EC to get to it even with SOW<br/>\nencumberred. I have been killed twice by sargent Slate ( a<br/>\ngood guy NPC-guard type by the inns in EC) now I stick<br/>\nto the tops of hills when I cross from the orc camps<br/>\nto the tunnel at NRO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plenty of questions<br/>\nabout armor, where to play and getting back to Grobb.<br/>\nGetting through NRO and Oasis on my own is most likely a<br/>\nno-go. I tried once and the desert madmen were very<br/>\naggressive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;let me know. Most of the posting have been for Good<br/>\ncharacters but I assume there are a couple of experienced<br/>\nplayers whho have played both sides of goodness vs evil<br/>\nand can help me out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grumph, 12 lvl shaman<br/>\nVazaelle server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
