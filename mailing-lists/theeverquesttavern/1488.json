I&#39;m probably going to do something<br/>\ndescribing the races, dieties, careers, and equipment. My<br/>\nschool has a SmartBoard that they project screens on<br/>\nwith a projector hooked up to a computer&#39;s video card.<br/>\nI could possibly do the PowerPoint (PP)<br/>\npresentation with this, but I&#39;ve never used PP. I have Office<br/>\n2000 Premium, and I have PP, but I&#39;ve never used it.<br/>\nThe report should be at least 5 mins long, and I have<br/>\nto make an outline as well. I&#39;ll try tinkering<br/>\naround w/ PP, and see what I can do. If you can give me<br/>\nany info, or help me out with a PP presentation,<br/>\nreply or email me directly at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:safritz@...\">safritz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
