Their site is<br/>\ndown right now, so I can&#39;t search.) (Heads are<br/>\nrolling, I&#39;m sure). Anyway, they evidently sent someone to<br/>\nthe Fan Faire, and published an article on in-game<br/>\nmarriages -- one woman married someone in-game . . . but<br/>\nshe&#39;s married to a different person in RL (who doesn&#39;t<br/>\nplay EQ, I think). The guy says he&#39;s &quot;OK with it&quot; --<br/>\nthough it was weird at first, but the guy (in-game<br/>\nhusband) seems like a nice guy . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That would be the sound of my privates getting cut off<br/>\nby my wife if I ever &quot;married&quot; someone in-game. I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s kind of strange, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m gonna have<br/>\nto go to EC (is that East Commons?) and see what all<br/>\nthe fuss is about. I bought my Dwarven ring mail in<br/>\nKelethin, and that place seems like an auction zoo<br/>\nsometimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;10th season Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
