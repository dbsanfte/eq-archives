Remember what<br/>\nSchool House Rocky said-- &quot;Knowledge is Power!!&quot; I have<br/>\nyet to play an Erudite or a human from Qeynos, so<br/>\nthose chars and their quests will actually be very new<br/>\nfor me, as would an Iksar (i&#39;ve only played around<br/>\nwith it a bit). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ is great at offering those<br/>\nof us who have played a bit a &quot;born-again-newbie&quot;<br/>\noption with the new expansions. Val-Shir?? It will be<br/>\nall new if you want it to-- BUT... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the EQ<br/>\nworld experience will still be there, so you won&#39;t<br/>\nfreak out the first time a 2d spider joins in the fight<br/>\nand hits you from behind. I remember jumping in my<br/>\nseat, shouting out loud, and running around trying to<br/>\nremember which way to my city zone (newbie gnome in<br/>\nSteamfont). I didn&#39;t even leave Steamfont for 9 levels<br/>\nbecause I was afraid to zone. I can still remember the<br/>\nfeeling when I first got on the boat to FP--- now I hate<br/>\ntaking any boat and pay to avoid it!!!! &lt;br&gt;You know how<br/>\nto hit the F9 key to see what&#39;s going on, how to<br/>\nstay safe in certain zones, how to get away from a bad<br/>\nsituation, basic fighting/flight stragegies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now<br/>\nwe&#39;ll have horses, and the whole world will be bright<br/>\nand new. Next year we&#39;ll have mermen/mermaids and<br/>\nwe&#39;ll all be riding seahorses and learning underwater<br/>\nfighting tactics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can&#39;t wait too see the first<br/>\nlvl 2 Val-Shir bard in full lambent armor. I&#39;m saving<br/>\nmy /bird for that one!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
