With a<br/>\nbard with an instrument-- might help you outrun one.<br/>\nMight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if you have a druid or ranger in your group when<br/>\nyou&#39;re in OT-- make sure they know to check Track every<br/>\nso often. Otherwise... OT is an awesome place for<br/>\naround 30. Before that LOIO is also awesome. Course<br/>\nkilling in Kunark all the time might get tiring. You<br/>\nmight want to try Velious at 30 instead of OT. Snow<br/>\nCougars should be good exp at 30 and you might get a good<br/>\nearring.
