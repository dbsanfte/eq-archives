Take a boat to Erud (Erudite city), and <br/>\nhead south. You&#39;ll have to go through the Evil city of Paineel&#39;s <br/>\ntraining yard to do so . . . that&#39;s not usually a problem, however. <br/>\nZone into Paineel, go forward until you see the HUGE FREAKIN&#39; HOLE <br/>\n(don&#39;t jump or fall into it, you&#39;ll probably lose your stuff), and <br/>\nturn left.  When you see daylight ahead of you, stop, align yourself <br/>\nwith one of the trees out in the yard, and motor for it.  Once you&#39;re <br/>\nwell into the center of the yard, you&#39;re OK. Then turn right and look <br/>\nfor the tunnel to the Warrens and the Hole.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould be fun to hook up with you, but I&#39;m on Sullon Zek. Dangerous <br/>\nplace, but I like it like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nKharlisht, Drinal<br/>\nLeofric/Aethien, SZ</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
