The stats are<br/>\ntaken from rubicite armor - the AC is pretty good, but<br/>\nonce you get past, oh, say, level 40, you&#39;ll need to<br/>\nswitch to better armor if you can wear it (Crafted,<br/>\nArmor of Ro, etc.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is plate based, so only<br/>\nwarriors, paladins, shadowknights, clerics, and bards can<br/>\nwear it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extract are extremely rare drops off<br/>\nof certain mobs. Charcoal off of elementals in<br/>\nLavastorm/Steamfont, Essence of Sunlight off of Sand Giants, Russet<br/>\nOxide also off of elementals...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you have<br/>\nthe dye, either a shaman (alchemy) or a rogue (poison<br/>\nmaking) can combine it to make a dye. With the dye, you<br/>\ncan tint player-made fine steel armor. Armors can be<br/>\nsingle, double, or tripled dyed. Generally, single dyes<br/>\nare darkest in shade whereas triple dyes are<br/>\nlightest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be warned, this stuff can be a bit costly. On<br/>\nPrexus, an undyed Fine Steel Breastplate runs around<br/>\n300pp, with a dye adding maybe 100-200pp more, due to<br/>\ntime investments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will tell you this, it is<br/>\nfun just running around visiting friends in a full<br/>\nblack suit of armor. Not many warriors get to wear jet<br/>\nblack armor. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar Alazeem&lt;br&gt;50th<br/>\nseasoned warrior&lt;br&gt;Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
