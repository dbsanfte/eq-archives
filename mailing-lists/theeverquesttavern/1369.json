You can have up to 8<br/>\ncharacter per server. I have characters on Drinal and<br/>\nVeeshan and I can&#39;t honestly remember what other servers.<br/>\nLOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for PK.. there are PK only servers, as well as<br/>\nteam PK servers that are dependant on your race.<br/>\nThere&#39;s also regular servers in which you choose to be PK<br/>\nor not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Agility and Dex are pretty much<br/>\nresolved as the stats of choice for Rogues. They dodge and<br/>\nattack faster with those two stats as well as backstab<br/>\nbetter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, all the stats are good. Even<br/>\nCharisma to a certain degree. I recommend going to sites<br/>\nlike Everlore.com or &lt;a href=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.stomped.com/\">http://eq.stomped.com/</a> target=new&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.stomped.com/&lt;/a\">http://eq.stomped.com/&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look up<br/>\nsome info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Up to you. For example, I spend<br/>\nmy skill points on Languages, some trade skills that<br/>\nare expensive to practice like Jewelry and Pottery,<br/>\nand skills at later levels for my guild that can be<br/>\nlearned only by spending at least one point first.<br/>\nOverall... up to you though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Clans or guilds are<br/>\ngreat. A lot of ppl join them and they help you get<br/>\nitems and find people to group with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being<br/>\nsaid, I haven&#39;t joined one yet myself as I&#39;m looking<br/>\nfor the guild that I think will fit my personality<br/>\nbest. Guilds also should, IMHO be the group that you<br/>\nhave FUN with. People you like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) have fun..<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic of the Drinal<br/>\nServer.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
