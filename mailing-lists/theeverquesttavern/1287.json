U at least have a Split paw vest don&#39;t u? Or<br/>\nmaybe a Lockjaw vest? I got all the spilt paw armor<br/>\nbefore lvl 12, and i got a Lockjaw vest at lvl 14. My<br/>\ndruid as if of right now is lvl 16, 1/2 of a bbl to 17.<br/>\nMaybe u consider these leather, but i don&#39;t. Also u<br/>\nsaid that u have alot of Wis items. Tell me, what can<br/>\ni get that is for 200pp or under for wis items. I<br/>\nhave goo ring and bracers.
