Not only are there the undead goul<br/>\nfrogs... but live ones as well! So if you ruined your<br/>\nfaction with them, things will be alot harder. The first<br/>\nfew things just at the dead side entrance to guk are<br/>\nlive frogs... just 3 but after that its all ghouls.<br/>\nthese frogs vary from about lvl 30 to 34, as you go<br/>\ndeeper in you run accross bats and spiders (wich will<br/>\nattack) so you cannot just get through with invis undead.<br/>\nThe place i have been currently camping with a guild<br/>\ni am in, &quot;The Aggressors&quot; in the tower. In the<br/>\nAssasin room to be exact. So far i have aquired no<br/>\ntreasure so far there, other than lots of pp. I have lost<br/>\nlotto after lotto on the Guise of the Deciever :( This<br/>\nis the mask that turns you into a dark elf!!! I will<br/>\nkeep the site posted on these short little trips.<br/>\nMeanwhile have fun in Norrath!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor, 36th<br/>\nBard, Minstrel of Norrath on the Mithaniel Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
