I haven&#39;t contributed much<br/>\nthusfar, so I figured I might as well<br/>\nstart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Testament of Vanear&lt;br&gt;Secondary Slot Item&lt;br&gt;+10<br/>\nWIS&lt;br&gt;+10 Mana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go to Moodoro Findharn in Qeynos<br/>\n(he&#39;s in Crow&#39;s Tavern in North Qeynos)&lt;br&gt;Give him 2<br/>\ngold. He should give you an empty testament of vanear.<br/>\nThis is good.&lt;br&gt;Give him 4 gold, he&#39;ll give you a<br/>\ncard (either a queen, king, jester, or something<br/>\nelse). If it is a jester, give it to him and receive a<br/>\npage. If it is one of the other cards, destroy it and<br/>\ngive him another 4 gold until you get the jester. This<br/>\nis half of the pages, place it in the testament and<br/>\nhike it to highhold pass.&lt;br&gt;When you arrive in<br/>\nhighhold pass, find the tavern that is surrounded by<br/>\nwater, I forget the name.. sorry. Hop in the water,<br/>\nthere is a hole in the wall under a bridge, swim<br/>\nthrough it. You should arrive in an area surrounded by<br/>\nsmugglers. They were apprehensive to my druid (at the time<br/>\nlvl 24) and some conned red and some green, so be<br/>\nsafe and don&#39;t attack any of them. Travel farther into<br/>\nthe smugglers area and you&#39;ll come upon an area with<br/>\na pottery wheel and a kiln or oven. This is where<br/>\nDyllin Starshine (aka your target) spawns. He is<br/>\napproximately an 8 hour spawn, so you either have to be lucky<br/>\nor patient to get him. He conned green to me at lvl<br/>\n24 and was easily dropped with about 200 points of<br/>\ndamage, perhaps less. Loot his body for a page and an<br/>\nenvelope. The page goes in the testament with the other<br/>\npage, hit combine on the book and voila! The envelope<br/>\nis part of another quest, but I am not sure what it<br/>\nis.&lt;br&gt;I was up waiting on Dyllin until about 4 AM, but I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t start until midnight. So.. a night missed in exp<br/>\ngot me 10 wis.. very useful.&lt;br&gt;I highly advise this<br/>\nquest for any cleric shaman or<br/>\ndruid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Druid of Spiritus<br/>\nValorum&lt;br&gt;Tunare&#39;s Chosen of Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
