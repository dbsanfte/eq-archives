I know. I&#39;ve been busy! Heh. Miss<br/>\nme?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) More than just the tank&#39;s responsiblity to get<br/>\nadds off healer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Many situations. Ex. Was<br/>\nthe guy fighting a large creature? Giants and other<br/>\nlarge creatures cannot be mezzed. Also, there were two<br/>\npulls to the cleric. Chanter needs help with two adds.<br/>\nAt least buy the chanter some time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) 2<br/>\ntanks? One definately should have peeled off. Secondary<br/>\ntank always peels and gets what goes off to the<br/>\ncleric&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Also clerics... quit healing so quickly. Unless<br/>\nthe mobs are hitting very quickly and the life bar<br/>\ngoes down too fast-- wait till tank is just a bit<br/>\nabove half life. By the time the spell hits, he&#39;ll be<br/>\nbelow. Mobs almost never agro for a heal that&#39;s to<br/>\nsomeone below half life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now granted it may take a<br/>\nwhile for the timing...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Heck, in a group, if<br/>\nI&#39;m awake enough to think-- I go and snare the peeled<br/>\nmobs... then kite them around or zone them until my group<br/>\ncan finish off the primary one. Usually, we can take<br/>\ncare of adds no problem after that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Druids-- I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t wanted to taunt in a while but here&#39;s something<br/>\nthat almost never fails to make them agro to me rather<br/>\nthan tanks. If I do this whole combo, it&#39;ll take the<br/>\ntank 2 mins with me just standing there to taunt them<br/>\noff me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First snare, then dot, then stun, then<br/>\nbeg. Yes that&#39;s right ... beg. Often times, I&#39;ve had<br/>\nthat be the turning point. I&#39;m way on top usually if I<br/>\ndo that. =)Course, I&#39;m also autoattacking and have<br/>\nalmost maxed attack in every weapon class a druid<br/>\nhas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6) Errr... there&#39;s a LOT of ways to deal with adds.<br/>\nMezz, kite, fear, root works really well if the others<br/>\ndon&#39;t, Wizard area affect snare and area affect bomb<br/>\nworks well too, Pets work really well, multiple tanks<br/>\nfor multiple mobs if they peel to healer,<br/>\netc&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could go on forever on this topic as I almost<br/>\nspecialize in groups. I know most of what other classes can<br/>\ndo in groups for cool combos-- except for Shadow<br/>\nKnight. I only know-- pet, fear, harm touch, dots. I know<br/>\nthey&#39;ve got a LOT more to them than that-- I just don&#39;t<br/>\nknow it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>\nPrismatic&lt;br&gt;Druid of the Drinal,&lt;br&gt;I am as I have been for<br/>\nages,&lt;br&gt;A Tribunal of the Antiquities</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
