Yeah. Lotsa meanies and unintentional<br/>\nmeanies and teenagers (not meant in a derogatory way--<br/>\nbut they tend to believe they are invulnerable, are<br/>\noften hyperactive to get started and forget to listen<br/>\nto long time players.. etc. But I&#39;ve met a lot of<br/>\nGOOD teenage players under 16 even.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However,<br/>\nfor every 10 mean acts, there are often 5 good acts.<br/>\nA simple buff, a kind retort, etc. =) It&#39;s<br/>\ndefinately a mixed game. It&#39;s not a perfect game by any<br/>\nmeans, but definately fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Iskar monk. Great.<br/>\nHowever, new players shouldn&#39;t play monk. Plain and<br/>\nsimply-- fustration on weight cap. Many ppl don&#39;t realize<br/>\nthat they have a weight cap for an AC bonus. If over<br/>\n14 stones-- you start suffering. Which makes looting<br/>\na pain. Also, monks are hard to play. Many monks<br/>\nand warriors I meet have an immortal complex.<br/>\nEspecially, iskar monks with a good safe fall and feign<br/>\ndeath. However, in a group-- that can hurt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m<br/>\nnot saying don&#39;t start with Iskar monks. They rock.<br/>\nJust prepare for a little bit of being poor Plat wise<br/>\nfor a while, and lotsa hard work, and making sure you<br/>\npractice mend, feign, and safe fall. =) Sadly, you will<br/>\nneed to find some light blunt weapons b/c hand to hand<br/>\nis better for you at first but later on-- monks have<br/>\nsome awesome 1h blunts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Yeah, yeah. I love<br/>\nmy druid. But I appreciate all classes. Grin. I just<br/>\nlike playing druid, bard and warrior best. I can find<br/>\na party role for any class. And unlike a lot of<br/>\nppl, I find I love to group with any class as long as<br/>\nit&#39;s a balanced party (aka I won&#39;t take another druid<br/>\nif I&#39;ve got 2 druids in the group already and no<br/>\nmelee, etc). Ppl that say necro&#39;s are useless in a<br/>\ngroup-- haven&#39;t worked enough with necros.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There<br/>\nmight be a bias towards playing a druid for me, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s b/c I like being a jack of all trades in a group.<br/>\nI do nothing well, but can usually find a niche. I<br/>\nhate soloing but acknowledge a druid&#39;s ability to<br/>\nquad, and up to octa kite (don&#39;t ask. Had a friend<br/>\nwatch it and he told me about it. Most I&#39;ve seen is 6.<br/>\nI&#39;d heard ppl brag about octa kiting. Before I had a<br/>\nfriend see it, I thought they were lying. But someone<br/>\nwas Octakiting Cougars. Lotsa ppl on Drinal<br/>\ncomplained that day. LOL. I don&#39;t think the guy was able to<br/>\ndo it long b/c that&#39;s against the rules.<br/>\nTechnically, so is quad kiting.).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) That&#39;s enough for<br/>\nnow. Too long a post already anyway. Grin. Be well<br/>\nall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatehue Prismatic, Drinal server Druid&lt;br&gt;Member of<br/>\nTribunal of the Antiquities&lt;br&gt;shooman in RL</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
