Looking forward to the<br/>\nholidays? I have been considering using some of my soon to<br/>\nbe (hopefully) newfound Christmas wealth to purchase<br/>\na video card. Does anyone out there have any<br/>\nsuggestions of a good card for EQ? Right now I&#39;m leaning<br/>\ntoward a Voodoo 5. Expensive but I figure do it right<br/>\nthe first time, and you get what you pay for and all<br/>\nthat junk. I&#39;d really appreciate some more input and<br/>\nsuggestions though. As for what is twinking, I guess there<br/>\nare different levels. It all depends on how much you<br/>\nare willing to take from one of your characters to<br/>\ngive to another. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m against twinking<br/>\neither. The way I see it someone had to go through the<br/>\nprocess of being a naked newbie at some point, if they<br/>\nwant to give their hard earned cash and equipment to<br/>\nanother character that&#39;s their perogative. I think for me<br/>\nit might take away from the enjoyment of earning the<br/>\nstuff myself, but on the other hand... Boy I wish I had<br/>\na lot of Cool Stuff! Happy Hollidays everyone!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
