My first character<br/>\never was a druid, a half-elven one at that. I didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow what I was doing and I believe his base wisdom is<br/>\n93 or so... abysmal for a druid. &lt;shrugs&gt; But<br/>\nI liked the guy gosh darn it. He is the only druid<br/>\nI have ever made though. There&#39;s enough druids in<br/>\nthis world, I think. We get stuck with some of the<br/>\nworst stigma in the realm of Norrath. One druid&#39;s bad<br/>\nactions reflect in the eyes of warriors and other classes<br/>\nupon a hundred other druids. (actually, I do have<br/>\nanother druid, by the same name on a server which split<br/>\noff from Karana, just so I could still chat<br/>\noccassionally with friends. I think he got level 2 and has been<br/>\nthat way.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as Iksar go, it is possible<br/>\nto not be as hated as some would have you think. I<br/>\nhave seen Iksar monks in Qeynos and Iksar<br/>\nshadowknights in North Qeynos and Kelethin. It&#39;s all about<br/>\nfaction. Iksar make one of the best necromancer races in<br/>\nthe game, at level 10 my necro Kroq can regenerate<br/>\nmana twice as fast as any other caster his age (save<br/>\nfor other Iksarian necros) and still gain HP (due to<br/>\nthe accelerated regeneration). Makes for easy<br/>\nsoloing, and even better grouping. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Remember-<br/>\nEverquest is a group oriented game. At some point in your<br/>\nNorrathian life, you will be in a group. Start young, when<br/>\nmistakes do not matter quite as much. There are far too<br/>\nmany 40th level folks running around, grouping for the<br/>\nfirst time, leads to terrible terrible instances.<br/>\nIck...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Note: It is a game. Never act like it is life, I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen too many people get pissed that they missed their<br/>\nspawn or lost an item and then just up and quit the<br/>\ngame. It is there for you to have fun with it, if you<br/>\naren&#39;t having fun, then you aren&#39;t doing it<br/>\nright.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to Norrath, and may the gods smile upon you,<br/>\nwhichever god you happen to follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai<br/>\nOakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Cheif Druid Executive of Spiritus Valorum - Karana<br/>\nChapter</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
