","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1438058681\">Whatcha been doin&#39;, brother? You&#39;ve missed out on<br/>\nwhat is commonly seen as one of the best starting<br/>\nzones in Norrath, our very own Butcherblock Mountains!<br/>\nThere are at least four quests I can think of off the<br/>\ntop of my head that a fine young Pally like you could<br/>\ndo quite easily. Come home!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bone Chips --<br/>\ntalk to Gunlok Jure in your very own guild; turn in<br/>\nbone chips in sets of four for exp and an<br/>\nitem&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aviak Chick Talons -- go through the door behind<br/>\nGunlok, and give four Aviak Chick talons (they drop off<br/>\nof Krag Chicks) to Bumle Reminjar for exp and an<br/>\nitem&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rat Patrol -- Jeet, one of my guild masters who<br/>\nstands next to the bank in Kaladim, will give you exp<br/>\nand an item for every four Rat Pelts you turn in. The<br/>\nGiant Rats spawn in the mine, on the bridge; if you&#39;re<br/>\nlucky, you&#39;ll get the Cleaner VII, which drops metal<br/>\npieces that you can also turn in to Jeet if your faction<br/>\nis high enough. Unfortunately, you get a Rogue-only<br/>\nno-drop item.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While you&#39;re in the mines, talk to<br/>\nDiggins of the Rogues&#39; guild: Diggins says he&#39;ll &quot;maybe<br/>\njust maybe&quot; give you a Piercing weapon for 4 Runnyeye<br/>\nWarbeads - I think they still drop off of Goblins in<br/>\nButcherblock, even though they&#39;re now Goblins of a different<br/>\nclan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve never done this one, but Allakhazam<br/>\nsays:&lt;br&gt;&quot;Bring Nultal Malfoot in the cleric guild 4 skunk scent<br/>\nglands for some experience, money, faction and usually a<br/>\ncleric spell. The faction hits for this quest are:<br/>\n+ClericsofUnderfoot, +KazonStormhammer, +MinersGuild249.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And<br/>\nthis is just in Kaladim North, and just a few that<br/>\nlooked appropriate for your level (if not class). Go<br/>\nhere for a full list of quests by zone (and send<br/>\nAllakhazam some money using PayPal, if you can, it&#39;s a great<br/>\nsite):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/zlist.html\">http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/zlist.html</a> target=new&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/zlist.html&lt;/a\">http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/zlist.html&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or, if you&#39;re on the Drinal server, send me a tell<br/>\nsometime and I&#39;ll show you around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>\nKaladim&lt;br&gt;15th season rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal&lt;br&gt;Specializing in<br/>\nbackstabbing, corpse recovery, and Butcherblock Mountains guide<br/>\nservice</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
