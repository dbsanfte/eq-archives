MUCH less downtime than a warrior<br/>\nwhen going solo. Besides, it&#39;s just fun to watch them<br/>\nfight.&lt;br&gt;On the &quot;Well rounded&quot; stats though, i&#39;ve never had<br/>\nproblems with them. As spellcasters they may not get quite<br/>\nas much mana as, for example, Erudites or High<br/>\nElves, but they can take hits better. And no finger<br/>\nwaggler can hide behind a tank forever. And as warriors<br/>\nthey may not do the raw damage ogres do, but they<br/>\nlearn skills, including combat skills easier, get<br/>\nbetter prices, etc.&lt;br&gt;That, and some people just want<br/>\nto ROLE-PLAY a human. Or an Ogre. Or a wizzie. Or<br/>\nanything else.&lt;br&gt;This is a role-playing game after all,<br/>\npeople. One that&#39;s a lot more interactive than most<br/>\ncomputer R.P.G&#39;s. So find a class/race you want to<br/>\nrole-play, and have fun with it. ^-^</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
