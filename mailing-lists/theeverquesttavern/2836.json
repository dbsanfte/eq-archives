I am also working on developing a<br/>\n  charter.<br/>\n<br/>\n    We the Mageborn of Norrath hereby form this society<br/>\n  of elite, to bring power to the residents of Norrath.<br/>\n  Our great world has lived long enough under the thumb<br/>\n  of the Gods and Dragons of great infamy.  This era<br/>\n  shall be at an end.  Change shall rock this world to<br/>\n  its very fabric, and we shall form a new Norrath under<br/>\n  the guidance of the Mageborn senetors.<br/>\n    1.  To be a member of the Mageborn one must be of<br/>\n  the class Mage.<br/>\n    2.  Any policy of Mageborn may be ammended with a<br/>\n  3/4 senate vote.<br/>\n    3.  Co-exist peacefully with the guilds of Norrath,<br/>\n  but afford them no special treatment, for no good deed<br/>\n  goes unrewarded.<br/>\n    4.  To declare war upon a guild, a minimum of 10<br/>\n  members must be present and a 2/3 vote must be in<br/>\n  favor of these actions.<br/>\n    5.  To become a member of the Mageborn Senate one<br/>\n  must be above the lvl of 20 and must be elected by a<br/>\n  popular vote.<br/>\n    6.  In achieving this popular vote, one shall then<br/>\n  change his/her surname to Senator, that all may know<br/>\n  of this station.<br/>\n    7.  Any complaints, made by the citizenry of<br/>\n  Norrath, shall be investigated, and any offender or<br/>\n  group therein shall be summarily court martialed by a<br/>\n  member of the senate and (a) warned (b) punished or<br/>\n  (c) removed from the guild.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, its a work in progress, but so far its coming<br/>\n  along pretty well =P talk to you guys online<br/>\n<br/>\n    Oh, PS the chat room will be named Mageborn and the<br/>\n  pass is dragonslayer, so if you see the chat room come<br/>\n  in and join.
