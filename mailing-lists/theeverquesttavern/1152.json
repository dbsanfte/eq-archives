You will want lots of AC for<br/>\nthis. Base agility raises your AC more than agility<br/>\nraised later by spell buffs or item buffs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also,<br/>\nwisdom is your spell casting power. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll<br/>\nbe able to put all 30 points into wisdom, but put a<br/>\nlot in there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, you&#39;ll get<br/>\nstatistical buffs, so keeping your stats high will never be a<br/>\nproblem, as long as you have mana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;51<br/>\nchampion of Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
