So wearing one of<br/>\nyour braces, the AGI bonus would have an effect of<br/>\ngiving you about +2AC. This is in addition to the bonus<br/>\nAGI normally gives--- rumor has it that AGI helps<br/>\nyour defensive skills (Dodge, Parry, Riposte, etc),<br/>\nand that with a high AGI you will evade hits or take<br/>\na fraction less damage from hits. In the VERY old<br/>\ndays it was believed (and may have been true) that a<br/>\nhigher AGI resulted in a higher natural running speed as<br/>\nwell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know someone who tried experimenting<br/>\nwith AGI, and SWORE that buffed in all AGI gear with a<br/>\nVERY high AGI, he would fight an even mob solo (he was<br/>\na warrior) and take only a few hits during the<br/>\nwhole battle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for not being able to keep<br/>\nagro-- not sure, but here&#39;s a thought-- IF the warrior<br/>\nis doing significant damage, AND therefore not<br/>\ncausing a need for Clerics to heal, AND the nukers aren&#39;t<br/>\nnuke-happy, AND the warrior&#39;s taunt is up, AND he is<br/>\noutdamaging other melee, then he should be able to keep agro<br/>\neven if the mob can&#39;t hit him well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I admit,<br/>\nthe benefits of AGI are confusing to me. Generally<br/>\ntanks are more concerned with offensive power than<br/>\ndefensive. If you are a tank class that likes to solo (not<br/>\neasy for sure), AGI and AC items might be what you<br/>\nwant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the answer is to test it out a bit more. If<br/>\nyou haven&#39;t maxed out your offensive and defensive<br/>\nskills, maybe work the new bracer into your armor a<br/>\nbit---</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
