Anyone can learn to<br/>\n&gt; become one,&quot; he <br/>\n&gt; added. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Practitioners of witchcraft focus on the good in<br/>\n&gt; life and the spirit, <br/>\n&gt; and reject any connection with the devil, Starchel<br/>\n&gt; said. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since their beliefs date back to ancient times well<br/>\n&gt; before the birth <br/>\n&gt; of Jesus, witchcraft has no bond with the Christian<br/>\n&gt; embodiment of <br/>\n&gt; evil. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Witchcraft has got absolutely nothing to do with<br/>\n&gt; the folklore image <br/>\n&gt; of evil witches with green faces and warts on their<br/>\n&gt; nose. It&#39;s about <br/>\n&gt; becoming a rounded person who lives in harmony with<br/>\n&gt; nature,&quot; said the <br/>\n&gt; goatee-bearded druid. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; NO HOCUS-POCUS NOR HUNKUM BUNKUM <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The headmaster stressed that his school, established<br/>\n&gt; in 1998 for <br/>\n&gt; wannabe witches and druids of 18 years and above,<br/>\n&gt; has no ties with <br/>\n&gt; religious organisations nor follows any esoteric<br/>\n&gt; movement. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The syllabus originally lasted three years but has<br/>\n&gt; now been revised <br/>\n&gt; to a more flexible form to suit students&#39; busy time<br/>\n&gt; schedules. In a <br/>\n&gt; sign of the times, it teaches courses over the<br/>\n&gt; Internet as most of <br/>\n&gt; its students live outside Austria. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A student graduates with a venefica or veneficus<br/>\n&gt; (from the Latin for <br/>\n&gt; witch/druid) certificate after passing written exams<br/>\n&gt; in seven modules <br/>\n&gt; and submitting a final thesis. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The first module focuses on awakening intuition,<br/>\n&gt; specifically on how <br/>\n&gt; to find sources of energy in nature and how to<br/>\n&gt; channel it. Other <br/>\n&gt; modules are astronomy, astrology, botany, holistic<br/>\n&gt; healing and ritual <br/>\n&gt; magic. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Curriculum information on the school website<br/>\n&gt; www.hexen-schule.de <br/>\n&gt; shows there are no modules like the Defence Against<br/>\n&gt; the Dark Arts <br/>\n&gt; class which Harry Potter had to take in the Hogwarts<br/>\n&gt; School of <br/>\n&gt; Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Some wannabe witches and druids are turned off<br/>\n&gt; enrolling with us <br/>\n&gt; when we tell them that our aim is to demystify<br/>\n&gt; witchcraft,&quot; said <br/>\n&gt; Starchel, who is an information technology<br/>\n&gt; specialist by profession. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;People do approach us hoping to learn how to fly on<br/>\n&gt; a broomstick. <br/>\n&gt; Then we have to disappoint them and explain that<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s much more <br/>\n&gt; important to let the spirit fly -- to be able to<br/>\n&gt; combine intellect <br/>\n&gt; with the soul.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The school has received a huge fillip from the Harry<br/>\n&gt; Potter books by <br/>\n&gt; J.K. Rowling (news - web sites) and television<br/>\n&gt; series such as Sabrina <br/>\n&gt; the Teenage Witch. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;We actually had kids phoning up asking whether they<br/>\n&gt; could ditch <br/>\n&gt; their school and enrol with us,&quot; Starchel said. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; THE WITCHES OF KLAGENFURT <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Student witch Katharina, a bespectacled middle-aged<br/>\n&gt; librarian by day <br/>\n&gt; who asked to be identified only by her witch name,<br/>\n&gt; said she was drawn <br/>\n&gt; to the course because something was missing from her<br/>\n&gt; life. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I was looking for direction. Christianity was too<br/>\n&gt; narrow for me and <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t give me the answers I needed,&quot; she said after<br/>\n&gt; completing a <br/>\n&gt; session of chakra meditation with Danaketh. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chakras are the seven key energy centres of the body<br/>\n&gt; according to <br/>\n&gt; Indian medicine. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I was a bit sceptical at first but what impressed<br/>\n&gt; me is that it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; not about belief or faith as in the church. The<br/>\n&gt; school offers <br/>\n&gt; plausible explanations for phenomena based on fact<br/>\n&gt; -- there&#39;s no <br/>\n&gt; hocus-pocus,&quot; Katharina said. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Katharina, who travels from Salzburg in the<br/>\n&gt; northwest of the country <br/>\n&gt; to attend the school&#39;s seminars, proudly shows off<br/>\n&gt; an array of <br/>\n&gt; bottles, vials and flasks with home-brewed potions,<br/>\n&gt; elixirs and <br/>\n&gt; fragrant creams with which she treats her friends. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;At first my friends and family ridiculed me for<br/>\n&gt; wanting to become a <br/>\n&gt; witch. But now they come to me for one of my potions<br/>\n&gt; to soothe a <br/>\n&gt; cough or whatever,&quot; she said. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Like Katharina, aspiring witch Saltah embraced the<br/>\n&gt; craft three years <br/>\n&gt; ago due to a thirst for knowledge. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;It started off as curiosity about mushrooms and<br/>\n&gt; herbs, but then I <br/>\n&gt; realised that I simply wanted answers to so many<br/>\n&gt; things I couldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; comprehend and that this school could provide me<br/>\n&gt; with them,&quot; said <br/>\n&gt; Saltah, who is in her mid-20s. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Both women said the course was challenging<br/>\n&gt; intellectually as <br/>\n&gt; witchcraft covered a swath of subjects. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Just learning and completing the syllabus doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; make you a witch. <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;ve got to work at it day in day out,&quot; Saltah<br/>\n&gt; said. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s going to take me another 20 years before I can<br/>\n&gt; truly call <br/>\n&gt; myself a witch,&quot; said Katharina, hunched over a<br/>\n&gt; toadstool. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>=== message truncated ===<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
