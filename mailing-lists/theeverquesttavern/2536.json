And healing would be<br/>\nless needed. But actually that causes Agro factor to<br/>\nincrease on clerics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re completely<br/>\ninvulnerable, you lose agro completely. Mobs only like to hit<br/>\nyou if you do a lot of damage to them AND they can do<br/>\ndamage to you. Taunt helps a lot. If you&#39;re a Ranger or<br/>\nespecially SK... you can really gain agro and keep it. Cause<br/>\nnothing says hating like a good flame like/debuff or a<br/>\ngood blinding/snare from an SK. (In which case you<br/>\ncould justify the Agility)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pure warrior<br/>\nshould avoid agility b/c they&#39;ve got enough armor stuff<br/>\nto increase AC as it is and damage/way to make and<br/>\nhold agro.

Snare however<br/>\nis better for overall mana)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rangers, Monks,<br/>\nRogues, SK and almost all casters are going to make it<br/>\nhard to hold agro and keep you a &quot;true&quot; tank. Even<br/>\nPaly&#39;s can hold agro better with their stun<br/>\nseries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS.. all that typing to say.. &quot;I said<br/>\nagility is not a factor b/c warriors were the point in<br/>\nquestion.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
