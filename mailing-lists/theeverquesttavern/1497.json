I&#39;ve only been<br/>\nplaying about 6 weeks, but I already see what twinking<br/>\ndoes to the game, and it annoys me. It&#39;s kind of an<br/>\narrogant thing that no self-respecting DM ever allows in<br/>\npen-and-paper D&D, but that Verant evidently doesn&#39;t have a<br/>\ngood solution for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t twink, and not just<br/>\nbecause my main character is only 10th level. I hope I<br/>\ndon&#39;t do it -- I think if I do, it means the game has<br/>\nbecome boring at lower levels, and I should probably<br/>\nstop playing. Because that&#39;s really the issue, right<br/>\n-- no one wants to go through levels 1-10 again, so<br/>\nyou twink and power-level to get to the interesting<br/>\nstuff. Maybe if Verant made life a bit more exciting for<br/>\n&quot;old&quot; noobs somehow, that would reduce the need for<br/>\ntwinking. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I watched a 5th level Bard dismantle<br/>\nthe women bandits in Lesser Faydark one night, and<br/>\nwas totally wowed. I asked to inspect, and discovered<br/>\nthat EVERY SLOT was filled with a magic item. Cripes,<br/>\nI had _one_ -- a suit of Dwarven ring mail that<br/>\nsomeone had pretty much given me (sold it to me for 5 gp<br/>\nor something in Freeport) (he wanted 5 pp, but that<br/>\nwas all I had). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do I like it when someone<br/>\ntwinks me? Sure, because it&#39;s cool to get magic items,<br/>\nbut more importantly, because it takes place in the<br/>\ncontext of the game. When the friendly Dwarf sold me the<br/>\nring-mail, another character standing nearby said, &quot;That was<br/>\na really nice thing to do.&quot; And it was. Why&#39;d he do<br/>\nit? Glutted market, maybe, but also perhaps because I<br/>\nwas a role-player. I&#39;ve found that other characters<br/>\n(usually high-level) reward that. But that&#39;s another<br/>\ndiscussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do we do about it? I&#39;ve wondered if one character<br/>\nper server would solve the problem -- that way, you&#39;d<br/>\nhave to get twinked by other people, at least, and<br/>\nthat would promote Verant&#39;s goal of encouraging group<br/>\nplay. I suppose hard-core twinkers would just buy a<br/>\nsecond account, but that would also work to Verant&#39;s<br/>\nadvantage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thing is, twinkers see nothing wrong with<br/>\nthe practice (obviously). Go to the class-specific<br/>\nRogue discussion board on Everlore and check out the<br/>\npost &quot;How should I twink my little roguie?&quot; Gee, maybe<br/>\nthe answer is, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dang, gettin&#39;<br/>\nlong-winded again. I obviously think about this game way too<br/>\nmuch . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of Kaladim&lt;br&gt;10th season<br/>\nRogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
