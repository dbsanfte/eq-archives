That&#39;s what started me on this whole<br/>\nthing over on the Everlore Rogue board. It was just the<br/>\nattitude of the guy that got under my skin -- &quot;How should<br/>\nI twink my little rogey?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, now I know why<br/>\nI can&#39;t stay away from this discussion -- I&#39;m away<br/>\nfrom home this week and haven&#39;t played in FOUR DAYS.<br/>\nI&#39;m jonesin&#39; something severe . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, but<br/>\none more thing, this on alts and mains. I have a<br/>\ncouple of alts, just a coupe of 2nd levels. But I&#39;m<br/>\nactually thinking of giving up on them -- it seems it<br/>\nwould be more fun to experience everything Norrath has<br/>\nto offer through the eyes of my main character. I<br/>\nstarted a Dwarf Paladin, and it wasn&#39;t as fun to<br/>\n&quot;discover&quot; Kaladim as it had been with my main character,<br/>\nbecause I knew the place already. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This might just<br/>\nbe a matter of how deeply I identify with Dwarf<br/>\nRogues/Thieves (the class I always played in D&D). But no,<br/>\nthat&#39;s not odd or anything . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>\nKaladim&lt;br&gt;11th season Rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
