You can pick<br/>\nup some patchwork armor pretty cheap, which is<br/>\ndecent at low levels. It&#39;s made by players using the<br/>\nTailoring Trade Skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then you can move up to<br/>\nbanded, which is made with the Smithing Trade Skill by<br/>\nplayers. Usually it&#39;s around 1pp per AC. You can probably<br/>\nbe in full banded by level 10 or so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once<br/>\nyou outgrow that, I estimate you could be in full<br/>\nbronze by level 15. Bronze randomly drops off of level<br/>\n30-ish mobs - a good place to try to get some is if<br/>\nsomeone is killing the barbarians in West Karana. Bronze<br/>\nshould last you quite a while; once you&#39;ve outgrown it,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll know what to do next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iskandar&lt;br&gt;53<br/>\nchampion of Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
