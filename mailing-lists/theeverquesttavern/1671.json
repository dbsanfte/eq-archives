I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1623804551\">First, check with the Hearwood master in your<br/>\nguild-- he will give you the rusty weapons quest. Not a<br/>\ngreat quest, but it&#39;s the only one you&#39;ll get from him.<br/>\nI would go to the ranger&#39;s guild to get the quests<br/>\nthey offer, and maybe even the warrior and rogues<br/>\nguild, if they&#39;ll give you the quests (I can&#39;t remember<br/>\nif they do, but I got XP from teaming with some<br/>\nrogues and warriors who completed those quests with me<br/>\nin the group). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is sad that there are not<br/>\nmany lower level quests for wood-elf druids. Once you<br/>\nstart ridding the Faydark of the vile orcs (which<br/>\nshould be your calling in life, if I can preach the word<br/>\nof Tunare here...) you will start to find Crushbone<br/>\nBelts (and later CB pads once you venture into CB<br/>\nitself). The belts are VERY valuable at lower levels, for<br/>\nyou can travel to Kaladim to show the warriors there<br/>\nthat you too are in opposition to the evil orcs. Give<br/>\nthe appropriate dwarf proof that you have vanquished<br/>\n4 orcs (by giving him 4 belts) and you will be<br/>\nrewarded richly in experience and by an item that you can<br/>\neither use, or sell for profit (druid spells don&#39;t come<br/>\ncheap!!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, check with the High-Elf cleric&#39;s<br/>\nguild. At early levels, most of these snooty clerics<br/>\nwon&#39;t have much to do with you, BUT remember that both<br/>\nof you serve the great will of Tunare. You will get<br/>\na quest to hunt down the evil undead in Faydark<br/>\n(decaying skeletons) and bring back 4 sets of bone chips.<br/>\nAfter that, you will be give a much more difficult<br/>\nquest involving the rancorous ghasts of the Lesser<br/>\nFaydark. Good questng indeed, and not many of Tunare&#39;s<br/>\ndruids know of this union with the Clerics of<br/>\nFelwithe!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Hunting to you!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of<br/>\nthe 24th Season&lt;br&gt;Defenders of Mithril Hall&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
