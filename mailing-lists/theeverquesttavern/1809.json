I love<br/>\ndoing quests, and learned early on that i&#39;d have to do<br/>\nother people&#39;s quests (ie. CB belts and pads) growing<br/>\nup in Kelethin, if I wanted to do any. One good<br/>\nthing about being a 1/2 elf is that you can start in<br/>\nSurefall, where the quests are better (well, at least there<br/>\nARE quests there, other than a stupid &quot;go out and<br/>\nfetch me some rusty weapons...haha stupid newbie!&quot;<br/>\nquest). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OH-- I am still trying to complete the HE<br/>\ncleric Symbol of Tunare quests-- have 3 ghast hearts<br/>\nafter about 30 kilss. Are druids SOOO powerful that<br/>\nthey don&#39;t deserve great quests at all<br/>\nlevels?????&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane &lt;br&gt;Druid of the 32d season&lt;br&gt;Leaving no<br/>\ngraves to defile--unless OT goons are about</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
