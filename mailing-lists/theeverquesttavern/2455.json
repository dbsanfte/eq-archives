You don&#39;t want to walk<br/>\naround with those giant satchels from the Bazzarr-- i<br/>\nthink they weight around 25 or more stones each!!!!<br/>\nThose toolboxes can be bought in Thurgadin too-- at<br/>\nleast they were when I bought them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahhh....<br/>\nthe good old days. I forgot that I lost a lvl 5 char<br/>\nin the Gfaydark-- never found him and just started<br/>\nover by getting a new rusty scimitar and cloth<br/>\narmor!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I started my Chanter, it was the first char I<br/>\ntook to CB in nearly a year. It was sooo funny,<br/>\nbecause even on Xev (one of the newest regular servers,<br/>\nthough almost a year and a half old) I was finding a lot<br/>\nof true newbies. OMG-- trying to explain /assist,<br/>\ntargeting, avoiding hits, pet control, nuking, the benefit<br/>\nof the snare spell-- things we just take for<br/>\ngranted. I remember being teamed with 2 erudites in CB at<br/>\nlevel 8-- these were their 1st chars-- How did they get<br/>\nall the way to CB????? It was funny and sad because<br/>\none of them died later and was bound in Erudin.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have played a lot of classes up to the mid 20s,<br/>\nand still find it amazing how many times players<br/>\ndon&#39;t know about the most beneficial spells/abilities.<br/>\nShowing a rogue how to evade, and my favorite is<br/>\nexplaining Harmony to a druid. There is so much to this game<br/>\nand so much to each class. Heck, I had to /bonk my RL<br/>\nfriend for not ever casting his stun spells as a Pally,<br/>\nand he&#39;s level 40!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ok ok ok enough for<br/>\ntoday&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
