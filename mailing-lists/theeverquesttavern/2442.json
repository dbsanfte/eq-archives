TOO many players now a days<br/>\nplay in so many other places that CB trains are almost<br/>\na nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Used to be CB was overcrowded.<br/>\nNow it&#39;s sparce and you have to be very careful.<br/>\nPeople playing in CB these days seem too pell mell.<br/>\nLotsa people that I try to train but never<br/>\nlearn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When your only healing in the group is two rangers--<br/>\nand your enchanter of level 7 says, &quot;Stay put-- our<br/>\ntwo tanks are at less than 3 bubs of health.&quot;<br/>\nfollowed by &quot;40&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Used to be USUALLY when I said it<br/>\nin CB. People realized I meant I had 40 mana, and<br/>\nthere&#39;s no real healing-- stay put before<br/>\npulling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now a days, for some reason, I see my two tanks run<br/>\noff and pull. Not once. Not twice. But three<br/>\ntimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First time was a Leg, second was 3 slavers, third was 2<br/>\nlegs and a slaver. Then I have everyone hold up on CB<br/>\nsafe ledge... I see a train run by and the guy sees a<br/>\ngroup on the ledge and actually turns into me and runs<br/>\noff as it kills me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alright, I hate that I<br/>\nrant about this BUT...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHY??? Do I sound pushy<br/>\nwhen I tell my group firmly &quot;stay put&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Come<br/>\non. I might be a newbie essentially still, but I&#39;ve<br/>\nalso learned a lot about grouping and used to kill in<br/>\nCB forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue<br/>\nPrismatic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... yes. I know. Sigh. Sorry. I gotta learn to stop<br/>\nranting at times.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
