The reason given for <br/>\nthe request by the FAITH Copy Editor was both ignorant and <br/>\ndiscriminatory. &quot;The Salisbury Post FAITH section is for people who <br/>\nbelieve in God&quot; and &quot;this is not the image that The Post wants to <br/>\nportray.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Salisbury Post&#39;s mission statement says in part: <br/>\n&quot;We are a marketing and customer driven company whose mission is to <br/>\ninform, educate and entertain. We strive to mirror the unique <br/>\ncommunities we serve and offer responsible public forum.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe fail to see how denying a Pagan/Wiccan study group an equal space <br/>\nwith other congregations fulfills this mission statement. The <br/>\ndecision was made with personal prejudices and not handled with a <br/>\nprofessional demeanor. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of whether or not Paganism is The Salisbury Post&#39;s <br/>\nreligion, it is our religion. The Federal Government recognizes <br/>\nPaganism/Wicca, as an official religion. Military Courts of Justice <br/>\nin the U.S. have also found Wicca to be a valid religion, deserving <br/>\nof protection under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In <br/>\nthe case United States v. Phillips, (42 M.J. 346) in 1995) the <br/>\nconcurring opinion by Judge Wiss stated: &quot;First, Wicca is a socially <br/>\nrecognized religion. It is acknowledged as such by the Army. <br/>\nSee `Dept. of the Army (DA) Pamphlet 165-13-1, Religious Requirements <br/>\nand Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains&#39; <br/>\n(April 1980), revising A Pamphlet 165-13, `Religious Requirements and <br/>\nPractices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains&#39; <br/>\n(April 1978). Further, it is acknowledged as such in courts of law.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nPagans and Wiccans are a part of your community. We are your <br/>\nneighbors, your coworkers, your children&#39;s teachers; we are <br/>\nprofessionals, but most importantly we are your readers - your <br/>\ncustomers! As engraved on your building and imprinted on the <br/>\nOpinion/Editorial page of the paper &quot;The truth shall make you free&quot;; <br/>\nmisconceptions about pagans, and being denied access to public forum <br/>\nmakes it all the more difficult for the truth to make any of us free. <br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the fact that this request was handled in an unprofessional <br/>\nmanner and with personal bigotry, we, the undersigned, as well as <br/>\nmembers of our family and friends, who are both of the Christian and <br/>\nPagan faith will not support The Salisbury Post. We will no longer be <br/>\na part of your readership until this matter is reconciled with a <br/>\nformal apology and the list is made public in The Salisbury Post. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We are not evil. We don&#39;t harm or seduce people. We are not <br/>\ndangerous. We are ordinary people like you. We have families, jobs, <br/>\nhopes, and dreams. We are not a cult. This religion is not a joke. We <br/>\nare not what you think we are from looking at T.V. We are real. We <br/>\nlaugh, we cry. We are serious. We have a sense of humor. You don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to be afraid of us. We don&#39;t want to convert you. And please <br/>\ndon&#39;t try to convert us. Just give us the same right we give you--to <br/>\nlive in peace. We are much more similar to you than you think.&quot; - <br/>\nMargot Adler <br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely, <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Undersigned <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.petitiononline.com/MMoon/\">http://www.petitiononline.com/MMoon/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLove & Blessings!<br/>\n<br/>\nMari<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.yahoo.com/magickal_mari\">http://profiles.yahoo.com/magickal_mari</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
