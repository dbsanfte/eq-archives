There is a quest in Felwithe to get a<br/>\nGOSSAMER robe. It&#39;s a white robe that is quite pretty<br/>\n(especially on high elves ^_^). You need to get the BRASS<br/>\nEARRING from the TASKMASTER in CRUSHBONE. When you get it<br/>\nyou give it to the FEMALE HIGH ELF SLAVE (in CB) and<br/>\nshe gives you a note. You then take the note to NIOLA<br/>\nin the MAGICIAN&#39;s Guild in FELWITHE. Niola gives you<br/>\nthe robe then. It has no stats but it is AC 8 which<br/>\nis pretty good for a newbie. ^_^&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for<br/>\njewelery making I hope you have a way to make a lot of<br/>\nmoney. It&#39;s very expensive!! It&#39;s the most expensive<br/>\ntrade skill to learn. At first you won&#39;t be able to<br/>\nmake anything that spectactular but eventually you<br/>\nwill make a lot of money back selling the jewelery you<br/>\nmake to players that need the stats. I assume you are<br/>\nan Enchanter? It&#39;s easier if you are because you can<br/>\nenchant your own metals. There are lots of good trade<br/>\nskill guides online. You should try Allakhazam,<br/>\nEverLore or EQ Statics. Personally I&#39;m a master Baker. LOL<br/>\nSo I can&#39;t help much with jewelery. ^_^ Good luck to<br/>\nyou though. Master Jewelers are always wanted!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
