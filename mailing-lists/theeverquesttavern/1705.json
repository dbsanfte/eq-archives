Used the same CC no problem, but I<br/>\nhad to get a second game, it was the easiest option<br/>\nfor a separate computer as I saw it.(I got the new<br/>\n$10 classic pack, just the original Norrath world, no<br/>\nKunark or Velious on that one.) &lt;br&gt;If you only have the<br/>\none computer, but want to have a second account on<br/>\nthat, you don&#39;t need to go out and buy another copy of<br/>\nthe game, but you WILL need to call customer service<br/>\nand purchase a new CD-Key for the second account. A<br/>\nfriend of mine did this, and I can&#39;t remember exactly<br/>\nhow much it cost, but it was about the same price as<br/>\na new game w/ the expansions, maybe a tiny bit<br/>\nless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Short answer: one credit card regardless, One CD Key<br/>\nfor EACH account (and that you get either by buying a<br/>\nnew copy of the game or calling Verant Customer<br/>\nService.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
