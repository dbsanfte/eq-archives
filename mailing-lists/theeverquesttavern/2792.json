Jesus was supposedly<br/>\nborn around march 7th or 17th I can&#39;t recall which. <br/>\nAnd according to the Bible Lucifer was the most<br/>\nbeautiful of angels, it was his pride in said beauty<br/>\nwhich led to his downfall.   Good to know someone<br/>\nknows these things anymore.  This school as it would<br/>\nseem is trying to teach wiccan practices without any<br/>\nfoundation in wiccan culture or beliefs, which are a<br/>\nsupport for the reason BEHIND the practices.  Without<br/>\nreason or motive, there can be nothing done.  Example.<br/>\nThe normans and saxxons killed each other in a bloody<br/>\nwar.<br/>\n.....  It is better to teach their method of warfare<br/>\nif you know WHY they fought that way, and what started<br/>\nthe war in the first place.  I am a supporter of<br/>\ndiversity, and I believe not all men are created equal<br/>\nbut rather different, and we should embrace these<br/>\ndifferences and develop them farther, rather than let<br/>\nthem all melt down in one big pot.. well gotta go <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- georgegriffey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:no_reply@yahoogroups.com\">no_reply@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a follower of &quot;The Craft,&quot; I wanted to inform you<br/>\n&gt; that witchcraft <br/>\n&gt; IS a religion...in a way. The pagan religion of<br/>\n&gt; Wicca is often <br/>\n&gt; referred to as The Craft or Witchcraft. Many of the<br/>\n&gt; findings of <br/>\n&gt; witchcraft in other religions have been borrowed<br/>\n&gt; from Wicca. Such as <br/>\n&gt; the traditional Easter celebrations. Easter is<br/>\n&gt; derived from Eostra, <br/>\n&gt; which is the Wiccan celebration that falls around<br/>\n&gt; the time of <br/>\n&gt; Easter. Wiccans would paint eggs to celebrate the<br/>\n&gt; fertility of the <br/>\n&gt; goddess. Christmas also borrows traditions from<br/>\n&gt; Wicca&#39;s Yule, which <br/>\n&gt; falls at the end of December. Even the common<br/>\n&gt; appearance of Satan <br/>\n&gt; was pulled from Wicca. When Christianity came to be,<br/>\n&gt; christians <br/>\n&gt; portrayed Satan as a demonic creature with horns.<br/>\n&gt; This was done to <br/>\n&gt; try to bastardize Wicca, because one of the gods<br/>\n&gt; worshipped in the <br/>\n&gt; religion had horns. Of course, this varies from<br/>\n&gt; practitioner to <br/>\n&gt; practitioner, as Wicca is a &quot;free-form&quot; religion<br/>\n&gt; with not many <br/>\n&gt; things set in stone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /rant off<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
