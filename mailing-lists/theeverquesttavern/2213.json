I spent the better<br/>\npart of the first night trying to get a name through<br/>\nthe the approval process. In my frustration, I made a<br/>\nfemale character and tried. I got the name approved on<br/>\nthe first try. I was just elated to get into the game<br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t care what I was. As for gifts, she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get any. Didn&#39;t matter to me either. Later on,<br/>\nshe was given some nice items that were good into her<br/>\nlow teens. A friend said that I was only given those<br/>\nitems because I was playing a female. So I bet him that<br/>\nhe was wrong.&lt;br&gt;I went and created a male half elf<br/>\nwarrior in Freeport. Within 5 minutes of appearing in the<br/>\ncity, I was approached and asked if I was a good<br/>\nperson. I said yes. I was then given a minotaur bp and a<br/>\n2handed sword (either lammy or langsaxe, can&#39;t remember<br/>\nwhich). I did not beg nor ask for anything. I considered<br/>\nmyself lucky. My friend was p.o&#39;d though. hehe&lt;br&gt;As for<br/>\nme, if I have extra and feel like it, and haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen hounded for stuff, I do give things away.<br/>\nSometimes I ask for minor things in return, like a<br/>\nspiderling silk or bat wing. &lt;br&gt;My warrior who has mainly<br/>\nwar only stuff or no drop, is always hit for items. I<br/>\nhad to ask one guy (7th level dwarf cleric in<br/>\nRivervale) what part of warrior only did he not<br/>\nunderstand?&lt;br&gt;Bottom line (for me) Beg and ye shall get naught. Be<br/>\nkind and I may loosen my bank doors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timmye<br/>\nCousteau&lt;br&gt;29th Druid (not Anon nor Role)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
