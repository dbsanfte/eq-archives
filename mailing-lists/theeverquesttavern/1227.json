It&#39;s pretty cool although I haven&#39;t experimented<br/>\nmuch with it. I was too busy hunting for spiderlings<br/>\nand discovering that I should NEVER beg from<br/>\nmerchants. LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Ppl have told me begging from<br/>\nmerchants was a bad idea. I found out why. LOL. Merchants<br/>\ndouble attack (or maybe that was dual wield) and hit a<br/>\nlevel 8 character for 48 a pop. Haven&#39;t gotten a raise<br/>\nin beg skill in so long, I feel pathetic.<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Thanks Iskandar for the info about skills. I<br/>\nfound the Kelethin Racial forge (don&#39;t ask me to spell<br/>\nthat... lol) yesterday. Makes me wish I had 100 plat to<br/>\nget smithing up that high. =) Oh well, heck... I&#39;m<br/>\nonly level 9. I&#39;m glad the things I&#39;m reading on<br/>\nFletching are wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also means I can feel free<br/>\nto fish all day long. Cooking a stack of fish with<br/>\nwasp wings and bat wings is TOUGH to gain skill. I<br/>\nhave no idea why. I only get a point or two per stack<br/>\nof 20. Almost tempted to sell<br/>\ninstead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
