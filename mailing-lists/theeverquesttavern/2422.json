For the mid-teens head to Oasis (although<br/>\nlavastorm is good if you have a magic weapon, especially<br/>\nfor mages and druids anti-summon spells). Around 20,<br/>\nsouthern Karana or Lake Rathe, or Everfrost (mammoths are<br/>\ngreat cash). Around 30, you can start looking for<br/>\ngroups in Rathe Mtns, Soldunga, or even the Stonebrunt<br/>\nMtns. Around 40, just about anywhere is fair game,<br/>\nthough Nagafen&#39;s Lair is good, or Lower Guk has some<br/>\nnice stuff in it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t forget Mistmoore<br/>\nsomewhere between 28/29 and 40 or so, pick up some<br/>\nMistmoore granite for Armor of Ro quests for your<br/>\npaladin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adventure around, there&#39;s always stuff to kill.&lt;br&gt;I left<br/>\nout the whole area around Highpass/Kithicor/the<br/>\ngorge/runnyeye... all of it good stuff...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good<br/>\nluck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nukai Oakenwulf&lt;br&gt;Tunare&#39;s Chosen of Karana&lt;br&gt;Chief<br/>\nDruid Executive of Spiritus Valorum</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
