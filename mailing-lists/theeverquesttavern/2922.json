Sorry for <br/>\nthat. Between school and works (yes that&#39;s three jobs in that works) <br/>\nI have been a very busy person. But I have managed to squeeze in <br/>\nsome precious EQ time, so I am happy. Now my question is this. I am <br/>\npresently lvl 32. I am a tick and a half away from 33 so in my mind <br/>\nthat&#39;s close enough to 34 for me. (LOL Math was never my best <br/>\nsubject as you can tell.) Anyway. I am currently in High Keep <br/>\ngetting my lvl&#39;s and as soon as I get 34 I am so out of there. The <br/>\nonly problem is...where? I have considered Sol A, but I don&#39;t know <br/>\nif I want to go there if it is crowded or if it is empty. (What with <br/>\nall the expansions and all.) So where to go at lvl 34 for an <br/>\nEnchanter? Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nRaven<br/>\n<br/>\nAKA Leria E&#39;ci Server <br/>\nAKA Tleya E&#39;ci Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
