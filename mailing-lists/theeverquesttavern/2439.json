My question is<br/>\nthen, who are shammys able to stack potions??? Aren&#39;t<br/>\nthey items with charges???&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s different<br/>\nactually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s why... 1) It&#39;s a special thing with Shammy<br/>\npotions and only certain potions. 2) It&#39;s not a stack of<br/>\ncharged items... as far as I understand it-- and here&#39;s<br/>\nthe fine line&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sow potion that you&#39;re<br/>\nthinking of as a &quot;stack&quot; is a 10 charge sow potion created<br/>\nusing an item called something like a Bear Skin potion<br/>\nbag. (forget the exact name. Nice tailored<br/>\nitem)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fine line I agree. But it&#39;s why you can have say--a<br/>\nsword with a right click 5 charge-- but can&#39;t get it to<br/>\nstack. Cause well-- it&#39;s a sword. In order for them to<br/>\nstack things with charges, swords with charges might<br/>\nend up kinda weird. (Just a hunch from what they&#39;ve<br/>\nsaid)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see no reason why they couldn&#39;t just make a vial<br/>\nof poison a multi charged item though. Give ya&#39;ll<br/>\nlike a Poison Bag like the shaman have and make only<br/>\ncertain poisons combinable (they don&#39;t want you to have<br/>\ntoo much of certain poisons).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman<br/>\nout&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... probably it&#39;s a matter of<br/>\nman power. They&#39;re working on a lot of stuff since<br/>\nSoL came out and if you were to post it on some<br/>\nVerant boards-- they might get started on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But<br/>\nin order to do that, they&#39;d have to get all the<br/>\npoison code-- figure out how they&#39;d like the charge<br/>\nadditions and tailoring would make a Poison bag, etc etc<br/>\netc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saying that they could easily encode doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean a lot of work. Just that the theories and<br/>\nconcepts and coding will be easy. Nothing new to design.<br/>\nEasy work in abundance is still time consuming<br/>\nthough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS... otherwise though, I hope this clarifies your<br/>\nquestion</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
