There are no<br/>\ndragons, or demons. No grand monsters, and no evils<br/>\nslain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yea, this is a tale of laughter and embarrassment for<br/>\nsuch as I. I, known as Fatedhue, Wood Elf Druid<br/>\nresident of Kelethin. He of the 4th ranking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was<br/>\ntravelling through the forest stopping the foulness of<br/>\nTricksters and Pawns. I was also harvesting the natural<br/>\nbounty of the forest when I passed a maiden most passing<br/>\nfair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was something I oft wondered at and I told the<br/>\nlady... &quot;Indeed, tis quite a wonder at the art of this<br/>\nworld that generates such beauty as that of the wood<br/>\nelf female!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oddly enough, this said female<br/>\nbedecked o&#39; her self in leather asked me, &quot;And of High<br/>\nElves?&quot; I answered her, &quot;Yea, laddie. High Elves are fair<br/>\nbut only passing fair compared to the beauty existant<br/>\nin Wood Elves. For what can compare to beauty forged<br/>\nin nature. High elves be of lofty buildings, where<br/>\nwe be of lofty arbols.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I passed on my way,<br/>\ncontinuing in my chores for personal inroads-- as well as<br/>\nassisting those of the Tunare Rangers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later that<br/>\nnight, faine did I pass said lady again, and I peered<br/>\nmore than passing glance this time. Alas my<br/>\nembarrassment!!! I noted her more closely as HIGH elf... and not a<br/>\nladdie of my fair arbols. She was a LADY of<br/>\nFelwithe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I apologized to the lady for my comments. I<br/>\nprofusely apologized for my drool-- I&#39;d fallen from the<br/>\nheights of Kelethin once too much. Tis&#39; indeed more<br/>\nembarrassing to insult a laddie or lady, than to fall in<br/>\ndrunken stupor to the floor of Kelethin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yea,<br/>\nindeed. That is my tale for those around. I am a humble<br/>\nstoryteller-- of no match for those Minstrels of Norath. I<br/>\nthank all for listening to my humble tales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fare<br/>\nall well,&lt;br&gt;FatedHue, Druid of the 4th, Resident of<br/>\nKelethin, He of Drinal.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
