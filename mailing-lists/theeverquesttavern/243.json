There, we took on some<br/>\nstuff and were about to kill a rare spawn when we ran<br/>\ninto 3 infernal goblin wizards...My group (I - a lvl<br/>\n31 ranger, a lvl 33 druid, and a lvl 35 bard) were<br/>\nutterly slaughtered. I walk back from Freeport (not that<br/>\nfar away from Sol) and get my corpse. Then, we get<br/>\nambushed by another horde of goblins - easier ones but<br/>\nthey were numerous, and we were forced to zone into<br/>\nNagafen&#39;s Lair. Just as we zoned into Nagafen&#39;s Lair, a<br/>\ntrain of greater kobolds hit us. Greater kobolds are<br/>\nabout lvl 33-35 and double attack for 70 damage. My 2<br/>\nteammates zoned back into SolA. Why didn&#39;t I zone? Because<br/>\nthe zone barrier had turned into OPEN SPACE - and it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t let me zone!!! So there I was, stuck in the zone<br/>\ngetting killed by 2 kobolds...When our group finally<br/>\nregained composure (and picked up 3 more people to make a<br/>\nfull group), we returned to SolB to get my corpse and<br/>\nto hunt greater kobs. When i zoned into SolB i<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find my corpse!! It had fallen thru the world,<br/>\nand i couldn&#39;t summon it. So...i spent about an hour<br/>\nfighting kob, naked with a FS 2hander (borrowed from<br/>\ngroupmate). I petitioned a GM but none were online at the<br/>\ntime... Well i eventually got sick of it and logged off..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
