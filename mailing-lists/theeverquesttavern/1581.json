Almost seems like a better question is,<br/>\nwhat&#39;s the _character&#39;s_ proper etiquette? I mean, if<br/>\nthey&#39;re training, they&#39;re hopefully doing it because<br/>\nthey&#39;re in trouble. They could be doing it to be a<br/>\njackass and/or for payback to someone who KS&#39;d them or<br/>\nsomething . . . But I guess my related point is that if<br/>\nit&#39;s a valid &quot;trouble&quot; train, then they should have<br/>\nshouted, and you should feel free to jump in. After all,<br/>\nyou&#39;re only defending yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sometimes pull<br/>\ntrains on purpose - Butcherblock is great for this<br/>\nbecause it has so many guards. Once, when I needed<br/>\nsomething off one of the bandits I did this: With SoW on<br/>\nme, I attacked the one I needed, got jumped by four<br/>\nbandits, killed the target, then took off for the guards<br/>\nto let them finish the job. I shouted out &quot;Bandit<br/>\ntrain to Crossroads!&quot; and hightailed it. Someone tried<br/>\nto help, but said he was too slow. No problem,<br/>\nwasn&#39;t looking for help anyway, just trying to warn<br/>\nfolks on the road.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Another time I got jumped by<br/>\nsome goblins that I couldn&#39;t handle, so I ran (again<br/>\nfor Crossroads). Didn&#39;t quite have typing and running<br/>\ndown at the same time, but I did have a wide-angle<br/>\nview on. Saw that a bunch of folks were fighting<br/>\nZarchoomi and/or Corflunk (big Ogres), so I detoured around<br/>\nthem. Figured they didn&#39;t need the extra grief.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I would jump in, because is someone is training,<br/>\nthey&#39;re hopefully in trouble, and if not, it&#39;s free<br/>\nexperience, if you can handle it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharlisht of<br/>\nKaladim&lt;br&gt;11th season rogue&lt;br&gt;Drinal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
