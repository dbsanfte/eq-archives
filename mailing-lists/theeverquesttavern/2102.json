Depends on<br/>\nwhat you mean by good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erudite-- yeah. I can<br/>\naccept those first although there&#39;s strong competition<br/>\nwith High Elven Enchanters. Erudite Necro sounds about<br/>\nright to me. Can&#39;t think of better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Halfling<br/>\ndruid is good. Big debate with this one<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Dwarf/Rogue&quot; Off the top of my head I can think of two better.<br/>\nHalfling rogue and Barbarian rogues both rock a lot more.<br/>\nHalflings start off in a great killing area. Halflings get<br/>\ngood stats with the Dex. Barbarians can&#39;t be stunned<br/>\nfrom the front and Barbs seem like a good choice. Then<br/>\nthere are those that argue that DE rogue is<br/>\nbest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And there&#39;s no real competition though for Monk. Has<br/>\nto be Iskar monk. Despite the locational drawback,<br/>\nthe regen alone makes Iskar more worth while. Having<br/>\nforage at char gen helps too in terms of -- money issues<br/>\nare always a concern with monks. They can&#39;t carry<br/>\nover 14 stones (unless you&#39;re a high level and then I<br/>\nthink max is what-- 20 stones at 60?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall,<br/>\nhuman stats aren&#39;t as good as Iskar stats for the<br/>\nprimary monk stats. And then you can&#39;t see nearly as well<br/>\nwith Human monks. Not sure why human monk would make<br/>\nthe list except for the ability to go to placed<br/>\nwithout being KOS. (which is important but not compared<br/>\nto the others-- otherwise a Troll or Ogre Warrior<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be nearly as popular as they are<br/>\nnow.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
