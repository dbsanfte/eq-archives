The red-con-killing twinks aren&#39;t<br/>\nnearly as powerful as their homegrown cousins (us). <br/>\nWhich, is why I play my monk with no armor or weapons.<br/>\n Things are harder to kill, so I get more skill ups do<br/>\nto extended combat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also like the thought of having a monk that uses no<br/>\narmor or weapons because, when I die I don&#39;t have to<br/>\nbother looting my corpse, which is a mojor problem for<br/>\na lot of low lvl chars.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn ending, I would be interested in hearing some of<br/>\nthe knowledge of other monks on this message board.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo with peace,  Psyko<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Luis Binnier &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shannara200@...\">shannara200@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You should stick with your lvl 8 Monk, It sounds<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; you have your heart set on that one because you see<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; chance to go after dragons. It&#39;s nice that you<br/>\n&gt; thought<br/>\n&gt; about helping newbies with your mage, but they will<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; just fine without the extra help.

With the mage, I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help people in the future, by supplying newbies<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; phantom plate armor, but with the monk, I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; carefully raised him with very high skill points,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; am able to take on lvl 10-12 equiv mobs.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of taking on dragons is very appealing.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Any help in deciding which one to go further<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be much appreciated.
