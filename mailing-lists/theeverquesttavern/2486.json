Ro and soloed Scarabs. (dk<br/>\nBlue) till 12. (just don&#39;t go for trantalas cause<br/>\npoison is dangerous even as a druid.) Then I grouped for<br/>\nthe first time in a derv group in N. Ro. I leveled to<br/>\n13 and then went to group at orc highway in Oasis.<br/>\nYou can probably go to oasis at 12 cause groups like<br/>\na druid who can damage shield the tanks, and you<br/>\nhave an okay heal spell.&lt;br&gt; You can stay in oasis<br/>\ntill like 20 and still group good. Groups are great<br/>\nfor druids. You can practice on the support role you<br/>\nplay. (and trust me ya you can solo, but grouping is<br/>\nusually more fun and rewarding.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After 20 make<br/>\nyour way to lake of ill omen, just passed Firiona Vie<br/>\n(i know i spelled it wrong) and you can group there<br/>\nfor a long time)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly I guess I just<br/>\nwant to say that if you are just a tad bit careful in<br/>\nButcher Block, you can solo there without worries of<br/>\ndeath. Just don&#39;t go to chessboard and stay close to the<br/>\ncrossroads guard shed. I have run to them on many ocasion.<br/>\nhehe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
