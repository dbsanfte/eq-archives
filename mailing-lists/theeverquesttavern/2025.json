I&#39;ve never heard of it making<br/>\nany difference to leveling up Jewelry skills. Only<br/>\nthing that does is a high Int... and some say a high<br/>\nWis. Some say either high int or high wis. Others say<br/>\none or the other with a benefit with a high secondary<br/>\nstat. Etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now if you&#39;re enchanting it to make<br/>\nit sell better to players. Yes, do that. That&#39;s the<br/>\nway to make money off the tradeskill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BEST<br/>\nsite for trade skills is www.eqtraders.com. The most<br/>\ncomprehensive trade skill site there is out<br/>\nthere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatedhue Prismatic&lt;br&gt;Master Baker, Beggar, Brewer,<br/>\nForager.&lt;br&gt;Excellent Fletcher (need 3 more points to master).&lt;br&gt;Good<br/>\nSmith. Master of all skills that can be mastered by<br/>\nDruid except for Hand to Hand, Smithing, Jewelry,<br/>\nFletching, Pottery, and most languages (have however,<br/>\nmastered Barbarian, and Dwarf... and gotten Elder Dragon<br/>\nto Above Average).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS... sorry. I&#39;m sorta<br/>\nproud (probably excessively so) that I&#39;ve mastered so<br/>\nmany skills,and have so many languages. And only died<br/>\n27 times at level 38. Course that doesn&#39;t mean I<br/>\nknow the game all that well. Just lucky.<br/>\n=)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPS... if anyone in Drinal has any odd languages<br/>\nmastered, I would LOVE to learn them. Don&#39;t know how much<br/>\nya&#39;ll would charge me though. I&#39;m about to have to<br/>\npurchase 39 spells. Be a bit short on plat. I&#39;ve only got<br/>\n250 in the bank and that means after spells, I&#39;ll<br/>\nhave 40 plat (if lucky).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shooman out</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
