That is<br/>\nbecause there isnt enough people now to control the zone.<br/>\nIf they didnt have the lvl block so high i maybee<br/>\nwould have had a chance on some imbued plate *drools* I<br/>\nhope they change this soon, or atleast fix kedge or<br/>\nadd some high 30s zones. Because those darn lvl 50s<br/>\nare takin over all the good camp spots. I mean c&#39;mon<br/>\ni hate hearing it when a druid says &quot;damn it! im<br/>\ndown to 3 haste sashes&quot; HOW FAIR IS THAT!?
