Get the spell Flash","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-97237328\">I played a Cleric on Rallos Zek up to 12th level.<br/>\nI do not know everything there is to know about<br/>\nPvP, but I can offer some advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get the spell<br/>\nFlash of Light and have it memorized at all times in<br/>\npotential PK areas. Put it on a Hot Key. If someone flashes<br/>\nyou, you can still hit the Hot Key and flash them<br/>\nback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Always try to keep your target box empty. Hit the ESC<br/>\nkey often as a habit. This will allow you to<br/>\nauto-target anybody trying to blast you with a spell. Then<br/>\nyou can Flash them without having to spin around (or<br/>\nlook up) to find them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep Divine Aura<br/>\nmemorized. You should probably be doing this even on the<br/>\nregular servers. It will give you a valuable 10 seconds<br/>\nof immunity to zone, bag your stuff, or<br/>\nwhatever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take your valuables off during long medding sessions.<br/>\nThe items that act as &quot;Kill Me Please&quot; signs are<br/>\nChest, Legs, Arms and Head. Boots and Gloves are fairly<br/>\ngeneric and do not attract a lot of attention. You could<br/>\nwear the best belt, earings, rings, mask, gorget, and<br/>\ncloak in the game...and nobody would know since they<br/>\nusually do not show up on your character model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If<br/>\nsomeone inspects you, target them, back up, get rdy to<br/>\nfight, run, or die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bank often. Losing items to a<br/>\nPK is the worst part, but no sense losing a lot of<br/>\nmoney as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep your health above what you<br/>\nusually would on a normal server while medding. For<br/>\nexample, if you have 3 bubble of health and only one<br/>\nbubble of mana you&#39;d usually just sit down to med. On a<br/>\nPvP server, I&#39;d spend that last bubble of mana to<br/>\nraise my health to 4 bubbles if possible. Nobody has to<br/>\nknow you&#39;re OOM. But they can clearly see your health<br/>\nstatus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talk to people. They will often tell you if there is a<br/>\nnaked mage (the plague of PvP) in the area. Steer clear<br/>\nof that area. If you&#39;ve been told so-and-so is a PK<br/>\nand then you see him and he says it was a lie, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t believe him. Better to be paranoid than<br/>\ndead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you see your friend getting rocked by someone and<br/>\ncannot help them (he and the PK are both way above or<br/>\nbelow you in level) try to loot your friend&#39;s corpse<br/>\nthe INSTANT he dies. You can then give your friend<br/>\nwhatever item you took back, and prevent the PK from<br/>\ngetting anything. I&#39;m not sure if this works anymore on<br/>\nRallos, but it did when I played there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spell<br/>\nStun is very nice. If you can time it correctly, you<br/>\ncan begin casting it the same time as a wizard starts<br/>\nhis casting. Stun will usually cast faster, and break<br/>\ntheir concentration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are some things I<br/>\nlearned during my time on Rallos. I hope the<br/>\nhelp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelmunbar&lt;br&gt;Enchanter on Brell (because I got tired of being paranoid<br/>\n:)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
