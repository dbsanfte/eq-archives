The Mx is just a hotrod Gforce2. I have the Mx only because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have an agp slot on my Emachine. Had to get the best pci I <br/>\ncould, which was the Mx.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the greatest difference you will see is in lag. Line lag it <br/>\ncan&#39;t help, but lag internal to your system is. With the 64mb memory <br/>\nyou won&#39;t get the same performance as the 128, as more memory is the <br/>\nkey to better eq.
