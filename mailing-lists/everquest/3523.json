I do believe I was <br/>\nright over them all of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you track Brutes in Warsliks Woods, and can&#39;t find them above <br/>\nground, check underground. I am camping Brutes in the cave located at<br/>\n3800/3800. The tunnel to Dalnir.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
