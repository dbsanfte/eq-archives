I have a lvl 3 human freeport<br/>\nbased monk there that I&#39;d want to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I&#39;m tired of my post 60 struggle with my<br/>\nfenin ro monk, but read the news of exp changes and<br/>\nsoloing with interest.  I&#39;m also interested in the<br/>\nnews that some of the PoP zones are opening up based<br/>\non level instead of the stupid keys.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have opinions about where a 60+ monk can<br/>\nreasonably solo?  So far I&#39;ve only tried my old sol b<br/>\nstomping ground since the June 11 patch, but the exp<br/>\nstill sucks.  Maybe chardok, or CT?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m an inch away from giving the game up and working<br/>\non my chess skills, so a way to breathe life back into<br/>\nit would be great.  I don&#39;t care that eq is a massive<br/>\nmultiplayer universe...
