I get inspected constantly by lowbies<br/>\nand I inspect/am inspected by people my level all the time.  It in no way<br/>\nbothers me, and if it does, it just shows you&#39;re getting into the game a<br/>\nlittle too much.  The only time this should ever make you feel uneasy is if<br/>\nyou&#39;re on a PvP server because they&#39;re scoping for your items to see if they<br/>\nshould kill you usually.  If this honestly bothers you, I would imagine you<br/>\nthe type of person who is claustrophobic or who gets upset if someone bumps<br/>\ninto you in the subway or something along those lines.  Eventually, you&#39;ll<br/>\ntake it with an air of pride must likely, because it&#39;s usually just newbies<br/>\ngawking over your equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Selene &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:selene1212@...\">selene1212@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, February 07, 2000 12:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] twinked? / EQ ettiquette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Selene &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:selene1212@...\">selene1212@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Lanadina the Magician &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lanadina@...\">lanadina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m thinking back in old school, when I first<br/>\n&gt; &gt; started playing.
