And it can happen in zones that<br/>\nhad no lag before. I&#39;ve not really tried to fix it<br/>\n(other than rebooting).<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has been<br/>\n&gt; experiencing an inordinate amount of lag lately?  I<br/>\n&gt; mean more than you usually get, even in zones that<br/>\n&gt; are unpopulated.  For example, whenever I port to<br/>\n&gt; the Feerrott, I start lagging immediately, and then<br/>\n&gt; if I port out, the lag gets even worse, as if I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; carrying it with me.  But I had absolutely no lag<br/>\n&gt; before I zoned itno Feerrott.  So I&#39;m wondering if<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s something about that zone?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And before you say it&#39;s my computer system, I am<br/>\n&gt; running a Pentium 4 1.8Ghz with 1 GB of RAM, and a<br/>\n&gt; 128MB ATI Radeon 9200 video card.  I also have a<br/>\n&gt; cable modem connection.  And as I said, there&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt; lag until I zone into Feerrott.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Before you ask if I have anything running in the<br/>\n&gt; background, I use this system for nothing but<br/>\n&gt; Everquest, so I have already gone ahead and shut<br/>\n&gt; down all the background programs.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Before you ask if I have checked EQ&#39;s knowledgebase,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve already done everythign they&#39;ve reccomended and<br/>\n&gt; it hasn&#39;t solved the problem.  One thing I did find<br/>\n&gt; out was that certain zones will lag becasue on ATI<br/>\n&gt; cards there&#39;s an option for Wait For Vertical Sync,<br/>\n&gt; and they reccomend setting it to Off.  So I did<br/>\n&gt; this, but now I&#39;m getting lag in EVERY zone so I<br/>\n&gt; really don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And before you ask if I have updated to the latest<br/>\n&gt; video drivers, I did that when I found out about the<br/>\n&gt; Vertical Sync issue.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As you can probably tell, I&#39;m not without some<br/>\n&gt; troubleshooting knowledge, but I&#39;ve done everything<br/>\n&gt; I can think of, and the problem is still persisting.<br/>\n&gt;  The one clue I have is that the problem didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; start happening until after last patch.  So I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know if that has anything to do with it.  I thought<br/>\n&gt; I would check and see if anyone else is having this<br/>\n&gt; problem.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS, I can duplicate this problem on any server with<br/>\n&gt; any character.<br/>\n&gt; PPS Yes I have already filled out several bug<br/>\n </span></blockquote>reports.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on the eighth day God said, &quot;O.K.
