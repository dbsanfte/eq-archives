First of all, THANK YOU for all of your <br/>\n&gt; replies!<br/>\n&gt; Well, here&#39;s the fix: <br/>\n&gt; I knew that you spoke truth when you mentioned the background <br/>\n&gt; processes.  but when I went to msconfig and unchecked everything- <br/>\nno <br/>\n&gt; help. although avail went up to 93megs (from 20). <br/>\n&gt; I then tried checking diagnostic startup, it&#39;s the option that says <br/>\n&gt; that it omly loads essential stuff...DO NOT DO THIS IN XP!!!<br/>\n&gt; the probem is that one of the programs that gets unchecked has to <br/>\ndo <br/>\n&gt; with activation confirmation, so when I rebooted- it said that it <br/>\n&gt; was unable to be confirmed. I had to call the 888 number and go all <br/>\n&gt; through activation again because the internet connection was also <br/>\n&gt; shut down.<br/>\n&gt; here&#39;s what I turned off:<br/>\n&gt; deactivated everything in startup (in msconfig)<br/>\n&gt; unceckecked the following in services:<br/>\n&gt; clipbook<br/>\n&gt; cd burning<br/>\n&gt; messenger<br/>\n&gt; removable storage<br/>\n&gt; remote desktop help<br/>\n&gt; true vector (for zonealarm)<br/>\n&gt; uninteruptable p.s.<br/>\n&gt; M$ firewall utility<br/>\n&gt; I did this and couldn&#39;t get a connection, then I started up <br/>\n&gt; zonealarm and voila!

You might not want to put a housefan that close to your <br/>\n&gt; computer. Fans<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that size have an electromagnetic field that can cause problems. <br/>\n&gt; Some fans<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can disrupt monitors if too close. It can even erase or corrupt <br/>\n&gt; data on your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; harddrive. It&#39;s best to use a device specifically designed for <br/>\nuse <br/>\n&gt; with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; computer rather than something like that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Amy Williams&quot; &lt;amy_e_williams@h...&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
