Text is scrolling by fast on <br>my main window, most\n of which is peppered with abbreviations I <br>cannot figure out of course :o)....I turned one corner, and then it <br>looks like a big party...at least 15 or 20 characters, different <br>races/species, all slinging magic of some sort or practicing or ?&nbsp; <br>I, irl, was at that a little fried from this log-on and all the <br>activity and not having any inkling where I am, or what is going <br>on.&nbsp; I could find hardly anyone who would speak with me�a very<br>busy <br>place! Finally, a gallant, (sweet) manly-man :0), took a minute to <br>walk me over to some sort of vertically designed stone and I got <br>back to Greater Faydark and then camped.&nbsp; And so that is my <br>(probably quite boring) saga.&nbsp; <br><br>When I went online the next time, a most helpful Cleric struck up a <br>conversation with me.&nbsp; She was very generous with gifts and her <br>time.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, I kept getting disconnected 1001 errors.) She <br>said she gave to me three items � I think\n leather legging, a vest<br>or <br>jacket of some sort, and something else.&nbsp; She also gave me 107 <br>plat.&nbsp; The plat showed up on my inventory screen; but I can&#39;t<br>find <br>the gifts.&nbsp; She kept trying to tell me to look in my backpack as I <br>don&#39;t have any bags yet.&nbsp; I have scoured my manual and<br>guides�I <br>click on my backpack and see the image of the backpack�but I<br>don&#39;t <br>know how to `open&#39; it or access the contents.&nbsp; So I found a<br>bank and <br>put my money in, and went out happily hunting truth and injustice as <br>only a powerful 1st level Paly can do�and I actually killed<br>several <br>rodents AND a spiderling�AND attacked a skeleton-looking<br>thing,�<br>ding,I got promoted, now evil Norrath residents are cowering as I <br>practice my hunting prowess as a Level 2 High Elf Paly�<br><br>Now what?!&nbsp; I thought I would try to get some info before going back <br>on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love this, but have absolutely no one irl who is the\n least <br>bit interested in any sort of roleplaying type game...or knows <br>anything about EQ.<br><br>In one of the last EQ digests I read, Flaumigevylke said:<br>&quot;... But I have to say as well that there&#39;s characters from every <br>class I&#39;ve played with have done the same thing, they don&#39;t know how <br>to play and end up getting the whole group wiped out. Personally I <br>blame it on them being power leveled and not taking the time to <br>learn how to really play them or know what their full capabilities <br>are.&quot;<br><br><br>It would be so helpful to all of the newbies reading this, if you <br>vet&#39;s would give us a general overview of the most beneficial trek <br>toward being a good supportive player by the time we are at higher <br>levels.&nbsp; I know skills and training is somewhat different dependent <br>upon the race and class.&nbsp; I would love some personal guidance on how <br>to become a rock solid Paly!&nbsp; But, general pointers are also helpful <br>to\n beginners.&nbsp; There is a HUGE amount of information. Like, I&#39;ve <br>read in all my guides, if you are a level below 10 or so, you should <br>practice or train your skills any chance you get; and also not to <br>venture much past where a guard is, that you shouldn&#39;t try to kill <br>even the smaller mobs if there are multiples, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; --- so how do I <br>move up in levels?&nbsp; I have no inkling yet, how to strategize.&nbsp; I <br>know what my main inventory window is, but when I have killed <br>something and loot it, a different window pops up...does everything <br>I loot go automatically to my main inventory window, or am I suppose <br>to access some other sort of window to see the items I am obtaining <br>towards a quest I am on? Some character said he gave me a &#39;buff&#39; and <br>for me to go fight something---that the buff would be good for two <br>hours.&nbsp; But how do I confirm something like this; what window do I <br>go to in order to see what sort of magical help\n he gave me?&nbsp; <br><br>I swear never to write more than a two paragraph post again, pls <br>don&#39;t kick me off the list for taking up too much space and time!&nbsp; <br>Thanks a lot, <br><br>Sign me:<br>Hoping for a lot of help now, so that a few seasons from now I won&#39;t <br>sound so pathetic and I can later help someone else...<br>Q on Brell Serilis<br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com/\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br><tt>\n<hr width=\"500\">\n<b>Yahoo!
