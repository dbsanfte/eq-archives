It <br/>\nis called Homeworld.  Homeworld not anything like EQ or even a RPing game.  <br/>\nWhat it is however, is the most immersive, well scripted, graphically <br/>\nastounding and gameplay addictive game that I have found since EQ came out.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to describe in words what this game is like, I suggest everyone <br/>\ndownload the demo and try it fer yourself.  The demo had me hooked after just <br/>\nthe tutorial and I rushed out to get the game immediately. <br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro Wrathcaster<br/>\n29th Wizard - Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
