I know I do. lol.<br/>\nBut then I had wanted to major in literature. I make typos all the time so<br/>\nin informal conversations like this I don&#39;t mind a few spelling errors.<br/>\nI think you meant &quot;jeez&quot;. I learned the spelling from comic books. :-D<br/>\nI think that we should just get back to game discussion though, this is<br/>\ngoing way off topic and I don&#39;t want people to start nitpicking at each<br/>\nother.<br/>\nSo.. Anyone pre-order Lost Dungeons of Norrath? And is anyone going to wait<br/>\nto buy the storebought CD version that comes with a real life gift as well<br/>\nas an in-game gift of an 8 slot weight reduction bag for one character?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well,aren&#39;t we a big smarty pants,now!

(And sorry if that word is spelled wrong, they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t teach us those kinds of words in my school!)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; lori smith wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ok then you all want me to type with good grammer ok I will do<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; grammar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so.......while i am typeing email&#39;s to you all at least.

I am 14 years old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and going on 9th grade, k-6 is elementry for me and 7 and 8 are<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; elementary<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; middle school and 9-12 is high school..........so I have been going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to school around 10 or 11 years, my mom put me in school when I was 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years old. Ok is everything all cleared up and all or does some one<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; someone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; else have a problem or challenge for me? c ya l8er......oops i mean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see you all later-----lori<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t bother pointing out the numerous errors in capitalisation and<br/>\n&gt; punctuation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;m not a grammar-nazi, but if someone tries to maintain that<br/>\n&gt; they can do something then make several errors in doing it I feel<br/>\n&gt; obliged to point them out. We learn from our mistakes it is true, but<br/>\n&gt; only once they are pointed out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope you and your friends enjoy EQ Lori, it is a great game, and if<br/>\n&gt; they are fine with the way that you type then that&#39;s cool, but it is<br/>\n&gt; worth learning the standards of the rest of society too so that when you<br/>\n&gt; do need to communicate with people outside your peers you can do so with<br/>\n&gt; ease.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt; Version: 6.0.501 / Virus Database: 299 - Release Date: 14/07/2003<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
