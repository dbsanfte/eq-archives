I was not aware that there have been a<br/>\n&gt; few scammers in the group <br/>\n&gt; in the past. Sorry for jumping to conclusions. Oh,<br/>\n&gt; and thanks for fixing <br/>\n&gt; that little problem with the auto. messages, Su. It<br/>\n&gt; was getting annoying, <br/>\n&gt; LOL. To whoever it was that is seeking platnum...<br/>\n&gt; although it&#39;s very hard, <br/>\n&gt; you could kill giants in the Frontier Mountains.<br/>\n&gt; Some of them drop Forest <br/>\n&gt; Loops that sell for 300 platnum. However, like I<br/>\n&gt; said, it&#39;s rare that they <br/>\n&gt; drop them, but I have looted one from before. It<br/>\n&gt; just takes patience, <br/>\n&gt; although the experience sucks... it did for me<br/>\n&gt; anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -= Mippon - 40 Halfling Druid =-<br/>\n&gt; -= Nevfalath - 8 Dark Elf Necromancer =-<br/>\n&gt; -= Areznia - 6 Vah Shir Beastlord =-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Tired of spam?
