I, for one, find <br/>\nthe quests rather fulfilling (most of them anyway) but then I&#39;ve been an <br/>\nacknowledged questaholic for years now.  Sure, experience and coin are not <br/>\nwhat you would like but there is IMMENSE satisfaction in solving them.  I <br/>\ncompleted one recently where I had to find answers to the question of the <br/>\ndisappearance of the daughter of one of the guards in Qeynos.  When i found <br/>\nthose answers i was genuinely heart broken but, as always, i experience a <br/>\nmajor feeling of accomplishment at the completion of my task.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMany people who quest do it simply for the knowledge that they gain.  The <br/>\npride of completing a job that, perhaps, no one else has completed yet.  <br/>\nThere are more things in EQ than leveling and gaining items and money.  That <br/>\nsort of goes along with the recent complaints about how terrible the Magician <br/>\nclass is.  Sometimes, it&#39;s not about the levels, its not about the power, its <br/>\nnot about the monetary gains, its not about how weak or strong we are, it IS <br/>\nabout the roleplay.  Personally, I have found the Magician class to be one of <br/>\nthe most fruitful when it comes to RP.  Quests are all a part of the RP.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Light,<br/>\n<br/>\nMystyrain Silverlining</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
