I am convinced that such good will comes back. A gift, a <br/>\nhand, good advice. I cannot always afford to cross zones to do so, <br/>\nbut when I can I like to sow and buff.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I can port, I have decided to do so without thought of <br/>\nreward. Oh, of course I will go quite a bit out of my way for an <br/>\noffer of good money, but I have found giving a port to someone unable <br/>\nto give much in return seems to add to the game in other ways than <br/>\nmoney. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is similar to the way I like to drive. I try to adjust my speed <br/>\nand position in traffic to optimize the ability of other drivers to <br/>\nmove in and out and through the traffic. My thought is if we all move <br/>\nalong better I will get where I am going in reasonable time and <br/>\nminimal stress. Not a perfect theory, and it does not work all of the <br/>\ntime. But at worst it is a comfortable fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
