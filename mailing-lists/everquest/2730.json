Druids are always in demand -- &quot;sow please.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGatorscale leggings are nice Druid legs. 7AC, +4 wisdom, +15 hit points. You<br/>\nget them off the Ancient Crocodile (level 30-ish), way back in the back of<br/>\nUpper Guk, or you can buy them at auction for maybe 300-400pp, at least on<br/>\nTarew Marr. The Ancient Croc has been heavily camped in the past, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mammoth Hide cloak is a nice druid piece for the back. AC 7, +4 wisdom,<br/>\nsv cold +5. It drops off the ice goblin alchemist in Permafrost (level upper<br/>\n20s). It sells for about 400 pp or so on Tarew Marr, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the arms, adamantite armbands. AC 3, strength +3, wisdom +3. You can get<br/>\nthem for under 200pp if you are lucky. They drop in Howling Stones, I doubt<br/>\nyou want to go there to fight at your level.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor, 41 Wood Elf Druid of Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jerry M.
