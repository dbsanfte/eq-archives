I have <br/>\nlearned over my many years of traveling throughout the great world of <br/>\nNorrath, that the more I THINK I know about this world, the more I realize <br/>\nhow much I DON&#39;T know.  For that reason my fellow adventurers, I propose that <br/>\nwe generate a list of TIPS that each of us can both share with others and <br/>\nlearn from for ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are my proposed rules (subject to modification and advice from others):<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Only provide 1 or 2 tips at a time, you can add others each day, but lets <br/>\nkeep these posts short, pithy and informative (less time reading is more time <br/>\nplaying!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Tips can be general, trade, race or class specific, so to save time for <br/>\nall, use the subject line in your post to announce what kind of tip you are <br/>\nproviding. ie -  &quot;General TIP&quot;, Tailoring TIP&quot;, &quot;Wizard TIP&quot;, &quot;Human TIP&quot; <br/>\n.....,<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  The best TIPS will be those that are not readily apparent, found in the <br/>\nmanual or just plain common sense.  This list should appeal to both newbies <br/>\nand veterans alike, but the best TIPS will be those that someone reads and <br/>\ngoes &quot;ahhhhh, wow - I never knew that!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I think that&#39;s enough of a format to see how this works.  So come on <br/>\nlads and lasses, let&#39;s start an information revolution the likes of this <br/>\nLISTSERV has never seen!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get this EQonelist EverQuest TIP LIST off the ground, I will submit my <br/>\nfirst two TIPS:<br/>\n<br/>\nGENERAL TIP<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  When trading with NPCs in a new city or town (or any town for that <br/>\nmatter) /con (&quot;consider&quot;) a bunch of the trading NPCs and see which ones look <br/>\nat you the friendliest.  You will get better prices for both sales and <br/>\npurchases of items from these NPCs than ones who look at you indifferently or <br/>\nnegatively.  This can save you up 30%!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nGENERAL TIP<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Never  /shout &quot;HELP!&quot;  - Shouts are heard throughout the entire zone and <br/>\nmost players that could help you realize that the zone is huge and you are <br/>\nunlikely to be near enough to rescue, thus, they will rarely bother to even <br/>\nlook.  Always use /say &quot;help&quot;  - Then, whoever hears it will know that you <br/>\nare in the immediate area and will often come to your aid. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro<br/>\nErudite Wizard currently residing in Halas</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
