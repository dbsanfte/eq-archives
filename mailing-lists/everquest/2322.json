Just depends.  I <br/>\nspent a lot of time making deliveries for friends, helping out <br/>\nlowbies and such, and just wandering around.  That is what Rangers <br/>\nare supposed to do, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nTul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
