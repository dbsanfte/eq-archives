I have Area<br/>\n&gt; effect Tashani for 45mana and my pet can quad hit for 54.  I have spent<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; last 2 days killing junk in the warrens trying to get non Kos in Paniel.<br/>\n&gt; Not working to well still scowls ready to attack.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a side note the Kobolds near the king, maybe other places too I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; sure, drop some of THE BEST looking weapons in the game.  Stats not too<br/>\n&gt; good<br/>\n&gt; about like FS but the looks are great.  Make wonderful pet weapons, even<br/>\n&gt; though pets duel wield without weapons (except enchanter pets).  The<br/>\n&gt; Katana<br/>\n&gt; is my favorite followed by a 2hs that looks like the spear graphic but<br/>\n&gt; looks<br/>\n&gt; really nice when equipped.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mu<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
