I am currently playing a <br/>\nWarrior in the beta, and thinking seriously about playing a Paladin. I <br/>\nrealize that Fighters will be able to take and give more punishment <br/>\nthen any other class, and perhaps slightly more HP.  Does anyone <br/>\nhave a point of view on this?  I would really appreciate any advice <br/>\nyou may give.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br/>\n                    A man says to the Unverse,&#39;Sir, I exist.&#39; <br/>\nMark E.
