There was a big difference in the<br/>\nway this toon was treated by others.  I got healed<br/>\nmore and rarely died all kinda people wanted to help<br/>\nme and if you flirted them little wood elf eyes about<br/>\nbam groups started looking you.  <br/>\n   So I created another female wood elf this time a<br/>\ndruid.  I was having trouble getting levels with my<br/>\nmale druid.  At level 7 another female druid came up<br/>\nto me gave me all her lv 34 gear.  She said she was<br/>\nfed up with the game and wanted to pass her stuff on<br/>\nto another sister druid.   She sat down camped and<br/>\ndeleted her account.<br/>\n   Today my druid is my highest lv toon and still my<br/>\nbest dressed toon.  The guys don&#39;t flirt and hit on me<br/>\nas much anymore.  I think they finally realized it<br/>\njust my be a dude sitting there behind them keys. LOL<br/>\n                 My 2 copper Kymi Blackwolf <br/>\n                            48 Druid<br/>\n                             Zebuxerok(close enough)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
