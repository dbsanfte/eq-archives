Every expansion","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-909272539\">Jeff Gaurdry said &quot;Shows how much I go to Luclin. (worst expansion yet? in a<br/>\nword... YES.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t rate the expansion from best to worst. Every expansion offers<br/>\nsomething new. The high lights for the latest expansion is the new world<br/>\ngraphics, character graphics, alternative advancement skills and more new<br/>\nzones added than ever before. Now to class this as the worst expansion ever<br/>\nmight be your personal view, but I can guarantee that eyes on Verant and<br/>\nmany of their customers, it was the best expansion ever. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternative advancement skills are one of the best things Verant could<br/>\nhave come up with. There is no telling how many accounts would have been<br/>\ncanceled if there was no way of building / leveling your character after you<br/>\nhit level 60. The AA alone is the biggest A+ they could have done. The new<br/>\nworld graphics are great when you compare what EQ use to look like before. I<br/>\nhave mixed feelings on the new character models, some I like and other ok,<br/>\nbut in general, I like the new models.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I believe this was the worst expansion when it comes to functions<br/>\nworking properly on release date. Too many things went wrong on release date<br/>\nto mention. Broken quests, loot table all messed up with your normal 3 day<br/>\nafter release they patch the loot table fixes. But looking at the big<br/>\npicture, I can&#39;t really blame Verant for the holding the release date and<br/>\nsticking to it. Everyone is out to make money. Releasing SoL just before<br/>\nChristmas was ideal for to get those extra sales for new EQ accounts. On the<br/>\nother hand, I do blame them for not beta testing SoL hard enough. Hire an<br/>\nextra dozen personnel, work 16 hour shifts, do everything possible to make<br/>\nthe release date as smooth as possible. Smooth, it was not.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo sum up my point, it is hard to call one expansion over another the worst.<br/>\nWhen it comes to content, expansion 2 was better than 3 or expansion 3<br/>\nrelease was a lot worse than all others. It is really hard for me to single<br/>\nout any one of the expansions and call it the worst. IMHO they all have<br/>\ntheir good points and bad, and SoV had way too many good points for me to<br/>\ndown on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 1 gold, 4 silver and 18 copper,<br/>\n<br/>\nSistily<br/>\nGnome Warlord  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tJeff Gaudry [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bgrifter@...\">bgrifter@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tSaturday, February 23, 2002 8:16 PM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\t[EverQuest] Re: Subject: groups<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt;The Nexus doesn&#39;t go to West Commonlands.
