On all large encounters you are required to have multiple clerics, almost certain multiple warriors, one bard, one","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1388114495\">Ok some pointers to this class discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn all large encounters you are required to have multiple clerics, almost<br/>\ncertain multiple warriors, one bard, one shaman, one enchanter and then<br/>\nclasses with damage output. If you have a lower amount of clerics, add x<br/>\nnumber of mages for modrods or necros for manafeeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, a mix of most classes is needed in the raiding world, but some classes<br/>\nyou cant do without or need multiple. There isnt a single highend guild that<br/>\ndoesnt have more then 5 clerics online for a big encounter and also several<br/>\nwarriors. But the way the high end game is you need a warrior with defensive<br/>\ntanking big mobs. trying to use anything other as tank in the long run is<br/>\nfutile. <br/>\n<br/>\nIll give you a math example. The avatar of War hits for 1350 max. He quads.<br/>\nHe kicks for 250. He flurrys. That gives a maximum of 10650hps in one<br/>\nround...... Not even the best equipped tank in eq has this amount of hps.<br/>\nWith defensive discipline cut 40% of that damage. Still a considerable<br/>\namount of damage taken each round. There are several other examples i could<br/>\nbring up here, but i think you get the point. Nothing can replace the<br/>\ntankability a warrior has. Some fights you are needed to handle multiple<br/>\nincs and even though they dont have the output of aow its still a<br/>\nconsiderable amount of damage that needs to be handled each round. <br/>\n<br/>\nClerics and Warriors are needed in numbers on raids. Then some<br/>\nbuff/debuffers and then some mix of other damagedealing classes. Sometimes<br/>\ncasters are better , sometimes melees are better. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd btw I play a bard. I do just about 4 things on raids. On inc, i do<br/>\nocclusion of sound for debuffing. I do manasong, on certain mobs i do<br/>\ndamageshield, on some i do resists. This is what i do. And apply some damage<br/>\nbut in no way near the figures a damagedealing class can do. And yes, my<br/>\ngear is ok. We normally use 2 bards on raids. one making clerics/casters<br/>\nfeeling comfy, one doing resists/ds. Thats as many as you need really. You<br/>\ncant hit any mob at all in the range were fighting with 2 clerics... So<br/>\ntheres never a shortage of bards on raids while shortage of clerics and<br/>\nwarriors do happen for us. <br/>\n<br/>\n/Ranina<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: erik [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:naslund@...\">naslund@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 18, 2002 2:05 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] getting started<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Louis Gumaer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lgumaer@...\">lgumaer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yeah the three classes that are &quot;tanks&quot; are Warriors, Paladins<br/>\n&gt; and Shadowknights.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess it depends on if you want to play an important role in epic<br/>\n&gt; encounters or be able to solo well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The classes that seem to be really important in epic encounters are<br/>\n&gt;  the warrior(defensive), cleric(complete heal), enchanter(haste and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>clarity),<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rogue(melee damage), wizard(magic damage) and bard(resistance buffs).<br/>\n&gt; The other classes are better if you want to play mostly by yourself,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>explore,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; camp items, do quests, and just generally have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is the kinda thing that gives people the wrong impression about<br/>\nclasses.  Shaman are extremely important to a raid, from slowing a mob to<br/>\ngiving melee some excellent stat buffs.  High level Rangers put out obscene<br/>\namounts of damage and are able to tank mobs that aggro on casters, while<br/>\nbeing about to almost immedialely reduce aggro when needed.  Mages are<br/>\nexcellent for mana regen (mod rods) and CotH.  Druids are excellent<br/>\nsecondary healers on raid, throwing in heals between CHs.  Monks and SK&#39;s<br/>\nare excellent indoor pullers (breaking Fear is terribly hard without a Monk<br/>\nor SK to scout).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere really isn&#39;t one single class that is not needed in a raid situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
