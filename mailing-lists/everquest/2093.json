If your corpse had nothing on it, it may have<br/>\n&gt;   disappeared, but your own anwswer is most likely. You misplaced your<br/>\n&gt;   corpse. Dying at levels below five is set to be low-penalty (you lose<br/>\n&gt;   very little and get food and water when you come back) to make the<br/>\n&gt;   early learning a bit easier.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   There are tools to find corpses, sold by merchants. However, it is<br/>\n&gt;   best to learn to die with finding your corpse in mind. Try to look<br/>\n&gt;   around at landmarks when death is clearly coming. Try to be near some<br/>\n&gt;   object you can find easily when you come back. And unless you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   mind having to do this often, learn to fight in such a way as to<br/>\n&gt;   seldom die. Some gamers like to take the risks leading to frequent<br/>\n&gt;   deaths, but I prefer to hunt with care and die seldom. Seems more in<br/>\n&gt;   the spirit of the game to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Good hunting to you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   If --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Minigamer&quot; &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th level Druid in the<br/>\n&gt;   city of Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, with others, I got<br/>\n&gt;   killed by an Orc Centurian and when I returned to get my corpse,<br/>\n&gt;   nothing was there.  It was not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my corpse?<br/>\n&gt;   The book says no but I beg to differ.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Is it possible that I had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I<br/>\n&gt;   went back with a dead body I died again?  Which meant I found the<br/>\n&gt;   wrong corpse?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have<br/>\n&gt;   no food, no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I beg or do I start another char?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to learn which<br/>\n&gt;   way to go all the time and dying, it is starting to get to me,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since<br/>\n&gt;   the Chat from the game options was USELESS.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Rob<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
