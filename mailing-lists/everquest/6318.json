To this day I can switch bt DSL and \ndialup just by changing what&#39;s plugged in and forcing it to dial, if I need to \nuse the dialup for some reason (DSL dying on a CR for example, or a social event \nI couldn&#39;t miss during the time while the replacement modem was being \nshipped)</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"2\">If you choose Sygate, be aware that it says it has a preset \nconfig for EQ, but you shouldn&#39;t need this. Mine&#39;s ran happily for years with \nnothing configured except hosting UT games. EQ sorted itself out flawlessly on \nthe first try. All you *might* need to configure would be hosting other \ngames&nbsp; and they usually provide detailed directions either in the manual or \non their webpage.</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\" title=\"wulftech@...\">Wulfric \n  Rennison</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Sunday, August 07, 2005 7:03 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: Re: Re: Re: [EverQuest] New \n  expansion Beta Open</div>\n  <div><br></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Are you absolutely sure it&#39;s not a router \n  then??&nbsp;&nbsp; A hub is a simple pass through device.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t \n  define IP addresses or anything like that.&nbsp; A router, on the other hand, \n  is more complex and has an internal software that controls the traffic that \n  comes through it.&nbsp; If your modem is hooked through the hub, perhaps you&#39;d \n  have better luck&nbsp; disconnecting the modem from the hub and plugging it \n  directly into the wall outlet and dialing in that way.&nbsp; Then just let the \n  hub do what the hub do and see if the computers connect as they should.&nbsp; \n  I don&#39;t know if I can illustrate tis properly.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">You are \n  using:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phone jack &gt;&nbsp; \n  modem&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; hub&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; PC1, PC2, PC3, \n  PC4</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Instead try:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phone \n  jack&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; modem&nbsp; &gt; PC1&nbsp; &gt; hub &gt; PC2, PC3, \n  PC4</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">It would really help me if I knew the model # of \n  the modem and hub that you have so I know what we&#39;re dealign \nwith.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n    <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\" title=\"suceress@...\">Su</a> \n    </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Sunday, August 07, 2005 5:56 \n    PM</div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: Re: Re: Re: [EverQuest] \n    New expansion Beta Open</div>\n    <div><br></div><tt>I have a few computers that hook through the hub but I \n    don&#39;t use any special software or anything.
