In the swamp it is carried by froglok foragers<br/>\n(levels 6-8) and kobold hunters (7-9). Within Guk it is carried by<br/>\na large assortment of creatures, the weakest being the Froglok<br/>\nApprentice ( levels 6-8 ).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe swamp is fairly easy to pick up armor in, the foragers and<br/>\nhunters usually patrol the swamp edge between Jojungua&#39;s<br/>\ntower and the entrance to South Ro. Collecting armor off them can<br/>\nbe extremely frustrating as only around 1 in 10 actually load any.<br/>\nThings to look out for while hunting here - Jojongua ( a very powerful<br/>\nkobold ), Nynuga ( a deadly troll NPC ),  Zimbittle ( a high level troll<br/>\nshaman ), troll slayers, and the troll slayer captain. Be warned<br/>\nthat of all of these, the only one with an accurate con is Jojo. The<br/>\nslayer captain is exceptionally deadly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNPC trolls can usually be spotted from player trolls by the fact that<br/>\nNPC&#39;s are the only one who are not constantly running. Also a<br/>\ntroll moving a warp speed is also probably an NPC ( they make<br/>\nup for walking around most of the time by running insanely fast<br/>\nwhen they spot something to kill )<br/>\n<br/>\nBe warned that Guk is incredibly dangerous, being particularly<br/>\nsusceptible to swarms of frogloks. All the frogloks will flee around<br/>\n40% health and swiftly fetch powerful reinforcements, there are<br/>\nseveral chokepoints, most notably an exceptionally narrow wooden<br/>\nbridge that runs at several odd angles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a froglok escapes you it is usually safer to zone, unless you are a<br/>\nlevel 20+ party. The lone froglok might come back with 2 froglok sentrys,<br/>\nand then again it might come back with a witchdoctor and 4 Ton Knights.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost &lt;20 parties pick a room and camp it, sending a runner to draw<br/>\nthings to them, and ensuring they have plenty of space to chase down<br/>\nany runners. A lot of people choose the entrance room for this, for<br/>\nobvious reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSean Buvala &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sean@...\">sean@...</a>&gt; on 03/06/99 04:28:37<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\ncc:    (bcc: Michael Wyatt/AU/AMP)<br/>\nSubject:  [EverQuest] Woven Armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Sean Buvala &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sean@...\">sean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone fill us in on woven armor?<br/>\nOr, suggest a website with information about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it something that is made, found or purchased?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks very much,<br/>\n<br/>\nMemo<br/>\n7th Season Magician, Fenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGive back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nDeadline is June 19.
