But I know that while Paladins are pretty good<br/>\ntanks and can heal and rez people, shadowknights get spells that snare and<br/>\ndot mobs. They also get pets to sick on mobs while they med. In terms of<br/>\nbeing a flat out tank I think paladins might be better but don&#39;t know for<br/>\nsure. I do know that my brother&#39;s shadowknight tends to deal more damage<br/>\nthan his paladin. So maybe a shadowknight might be better. Even without a<br/>\npet they are still tough. Darkelf shadowknights do pretty well. I think they<br/>\nhave lower str than humans but they can see in the dark and fit in small<br/>\nspaces without shrink spells.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
