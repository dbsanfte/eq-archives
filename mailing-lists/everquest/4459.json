I left <br>this<br>&gt; &gt; group once before because of idiotic members who insisted on <br>forcing<br>&gt; &gt; their opinions apon others, and I will not put up with it. I have<br>&gt; &gt; better things to do with my time then spend it with opinionated <br>low<br>&gt; &gt; lifes. Su, I&#39;m sorry for everything, none of this goes to you, I <br>know<br>&gt; &gt; you tired, but there are just too many morons to filter out of the<br>&gt; &gt; group. To the rest of you, you will never get anywhere in life <br>with<br>&gt; &gt; the attitudes you have. Only in a fantasy game like EverQuest will<br>&gt; &gt; you ever be something. But at some point you need to grow up and <br>face<br>&gt; &gt; reality, and it&#39;s not going to be fun or easy when you do. Do not<br>&gt; &gt; bother replying to this post. Leave your fights and comments out <br>of<br>&gt; &gt; Su&#39;s group and for once in your life respect her wishes and be<br>&gt; &gt; CONSIDERATE. If you forgot what that word means, get a <br>dictionary. If<br>&gt; &gt; you MUST comment, e-mail me personally, but I most likely will <br>just<br>&gt; &gt; delete the message. Like I said, I have better things to do.
