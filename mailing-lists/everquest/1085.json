Just make friends, just like you<br/>\n&gt; would elsewhere.  Pkers generally don&#39;t try to make friends and hang out<br/>\n&gt; w/<br/>\n&gt; you.  They just rush up when you&#39;re weak or obviously much lower level<br/>\n&gt; than<br/>\n&gt; you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They can&#39;t get anything in bags.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They can take things you are wearing, but it&#39;s only 1 random item..so if<br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t want to lose something cool, bag it b4 u die.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Guards will protect you if you&#39;re right next to them, but don&#39;t attack.<br/>\n&gt; Let them hit you, and the guard will step in.  However, they won&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; anything about you getting casted on or shot w/ a bow from a distance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
