Still trying to figure out the<br/>\nnew icons for the spells atm.  I like it that you can have separate chat<br/>\nwindows for your frequently used chats guild tells etc. helps keep stuff<br/>\nseparate a lot better when you are in a battle or have more than one<br/>\nconversation going at the same time  one thing I miss from the old UI is the<br/>\nface changing ability. hehe there are times when I would like to change my<br/>\nface around just for the heck of it but if I really wanna do that I guess I<br/>\ncould always go back to the old UI for that.  Just wonder if I would have to<br/>\nredo all my  NewUI settings when I go back..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for JaggedPine I&#39;ve not traveled there yet.  I was at the Bazaar just<br/>\nbefore I logged and there were 238 peeps there when I went ld when my<br/>\nAntivirus  autoscan kicked in at 5am EST this morning LOL.
