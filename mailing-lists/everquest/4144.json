Had a bit <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; a break between sessions due to having no power for most of a week. <br/>\n&gt; Quite a storm here in the Central Coast district of California.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In talking with many NPC&#39;s I found them giving me about a paragraph <br/>\n&gt; of monologue, breaking at a point which indicates more to come. <br/>\n&gt; However, few have the &quot;continue&quot; command attached. Anyone know how <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; get the whole monologue from these NPC&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I tried increasing the size of my dialogue box, but had no success. <br/>\n&gt; Now I did have two boxes open, side by side, and only tried adding <br/>\n&gt; length to the box in which the NPC&#39;s were talking. I may try a <br/>\nwider, <br/>\n&gt; longer box next time.
