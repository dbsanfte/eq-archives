As for the faction levels...basically they<br/>\nare, from lowest to highest.... Scowls ready to attack, threatening,<br/>\ndubious, apprehensive (i may have those two backwards,) indifferently,<br/>\namiably, warmly, ally....so you have 2 more levels with the swiftails.  As<br/>\nfor the factions of major city guards, there are usually some common mob<br/>\naround there that gives you faction with them.  There are sites that list<br/>\nwhat faction the guards are on and how to get good faction with them.  Be<br/>\nwarned however, some guards may be on totally different factions, one<br/>\nexample is Qeynos where corrupt and good guards wander the same areas (my<br/>\nbeast is KOS to the corrupt and ally to the good.  Same with Cabalis,<br/>\namiably to the warriors, scowls to the crusaders.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying a totally evil race you have your work cut out for you if you want<br/>\nto enter most cities.  So far as i know the only cities that allow any race<br/>\nto enter without faction adjustments are cities on Luclin and the city in<br/>\nPoK.  (BTW, to all you druids out there....NEVER head up to Shar Vahl in<br/>\nwolf form...cats and dogs DON&#39;T mix.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck getting good faction with the towns you want to enter, if you<br/>\nneed any info just ask here or check major EQ sites...they usually have<br/>\ngreat information for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Barry Stockinger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:techpriest@...\">techpriest@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 13, 2004 6:38 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Faction<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Is there some way to see my faction scores?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How can I tell what faction somebody is?
