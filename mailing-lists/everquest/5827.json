My 49 ranger was<br/>\n&gt; advised by the task masters to go to Rathe Mountains for a task. I did, <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; everything was pointing me to Lower Guk. I&#39;ve never really been through<br/>\n&gt; Upper and Lower Guk, and going that far underground with a ranger just <br/>\n&gt; makes<br/>\n&gt; me concerned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I abandoned the task. The next thing I tried was getting a task from a <br/>\n&gt; task<br/>\n&gt; master in Overthere. It sent me into Burning Woods, where one of the <br/>\n&gt; things<br/>\n&gt; I had to do was enter the giant fort and scout it out. To accomplish that, <br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; discovered I had to run into the middle of the fort. I was invisible, but <br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; soon as I got within agrro range, I started wailed on by a giant.<br/>\n&gt; Thankfully, a group was pulling giants from the fort, so it was somewhat<br/>\n&gt; abandoned. I trained a giant or two out and ran for the zone line. The <br/>\n&gt; next<br/>\n&gt; step is to kill 10 skeletons (can&#39;t remember exactly what type, but I know<br/>\n&gt; they con dark blue -- not sure how well bow-kiting will work in such a <br/>\n&gt; busy<br/>\n&gt; zone).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Frustrated with such difficult and dangerous tasks for my 49 ranger, I <br/>\n&gt; tried<br/>\n&gt; a task with 10 cleric. I was sent into Innothule Swamp from a PoK task<br/>\n&gt; master and told to kill 10 bull alligators (most con white, some a healthy<br/>\n&gt; dark blue). I had to run for my life and died about 10 feet from the PoK<br/>\n&gt; book. I didn&#39;t realize bull alligators helped each other out. I got <br/>\n&gt; trounced<br/>\n&gt; by two of them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m becoming increasingly convinced that tasks are not soloable. :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Nick Thompson [mailto:poolsharkbc@...]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only place that would give me a task was in the<br/>\n&gt; Dreadlands, and it sent me ( a 52 Druid) into Chardok<br/>\n&gt; for a recon mission.  Thought it couldn&#39;t be that bad,<br/>\n&gt; but I had never been to Chardok before.  The mission<br/>\n&gt; was to enter the fort inside Chardok and explore the<br/>\n&gt; area around the first bridge.
