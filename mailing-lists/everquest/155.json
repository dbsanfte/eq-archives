Its just a<br/>\nrepresentation of soceity and the culture we live in.  I myself look at them<br/>\nsometimes when i feel im stuck.  The problem is though is.. during the game<br/>\npeople /ooc or /shout out for solutions and people are so quick to give them<br/>\nthe answer to any question. Unfortutely the answer is right there i cant<br/>\nblock it out I can remove it from my mind.  I just wish that people would<br/>\ntry to keep some mystery to the game, and i know i can just filter out<br/>\nShouts and Out of Characters but... i shouldnt have to do that to enjoy the<br/>\ngame.  Everyone just wants a hand out.. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Shane Bole [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 2:03 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Role Playing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Shane Bole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nthis is pretty lame... this is an RPG, but on all the polls, people want<br/>\nwalkthroughs on quests? where is the fun in that? maybe a hint or 2, but its<br/>\nno fun walking around following a guide telling you to avoid so and so<br/>\nwhatever to not get killed.<br/>\njust wondering if anyone aggrees with this...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.!<br/>\nLive Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns!<br/>\nAccessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!!<br/>\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
