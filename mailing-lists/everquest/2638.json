However, that is only if you want to keep the mob aggroed on you -- \nthat is, you are primary tank. Rangers don&#39;t usually want to keep aggro, though, \nbeing as a rule more lightly armored than warriors, SKs, and paladins. The \nranger is a damage-dealer, not a damage taker. Thus,&nbsp;a ranger should have a \nhigher damage, slower weapon in primary so they can deal out damage without \ndrawing aggro away from the main tank.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I have seen the issue argued other ways, though. \nThis is just how it was explained to me.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Froondor, 41 druid of Tarew Marr</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"lgumaer@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lgumaer@...\">J.
