Since both of you said it, I&#39;m more likely to remember it when I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; helping my mom do her shammy&#39;s epic.<br/>\n&gt; Right now I need to start on my own epic. People would love me if I had a<br/>\n&gt; click stick. And it would save so much mana. I swear I would rez anyone<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; helped me for free forever. Oh wait, I rez most people for free anyways. I<br/>\n&gt; never ask for donations for it. I just occassionaly accept donations. If<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; person is a friend I refuse donation. And if it was a really easy rez or I<br/>\n&gt; found the body or just offered to go do the rez without being asked I<br/>\nrefuse<br/>\n&gt; donation. Which would explain why I have no money. lol. I know, I&#39;m not<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; most aggressive or best player, but I enjoy the way I play.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.385 / Virus Database: 217 - Release Date: 9/4/02 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
