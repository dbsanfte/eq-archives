I went with Sygate originally bc I only had 2 \nmachines linked with a crossover cable, then kept it when I switched to a hub \nand eventually a switch as things progressed. At the time it was one good, solid \nstable machine that was on all the time and had a reliable, fast dialup modem, \nand a second that was only on when I was using it, and had a fussy, slower \nmodem...but better overall hardware for EQ. Over time the original LAN server \nhas just been tweaked to keep up with each change, like switching from dialup to \nDSL. With it being Win98, it didn&#39;t have ICS, and from what I&#39;m told ICS gets \nstupid at times, so I went with Sygate...if nothing else, it got the job done \nthen, and gets it done just as well now. I wouldn&#39;t recommend making your setup \nany more complicated than needed, as that just means more chance of something \nf&#39;in up....but if you don&#39;t like ICS or it doesn&#39;t work quite right and you&#39;d \nrather opt for the cheaper hub or switch, then Sygate might be perfect for you. \nThere&#39;s a month free trial, so you have a decent chance to see if it meets your \nneeds and likes your setup. </font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\" title=\"wulftech@...\">Wulfric \n  Rennison</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, September 29, 2003 7:17 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Computer \n  Question</div>\n  <div><br></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Yeah I supose you could do that with a standard \n  networking hub, but best bet is to go with a router.&nbsp; Usually doesn&#39;t \n  require any extra software, it&#39;s easy to configure, and most of them have \n  built in firewalls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ve never heard of SyGate, but Windows \n  ME/XP both have something called Internet Connection sharing which essentially \n  sets up a proxy server ont he host machine and allows all the others to \n  connect through it.&nbsp; I used it before and its okay but a little \n  tempermental at times when you start adding 3rd party firewall software to the \n  mix.&nbsp; I&#39;d still reccomend going with a router.&nbsp; Small 4 port routers \n  aren&#39;t that expensive.&nbsp; You can pick them up at Best buy or Comp USA for \n  less than $60.&nbsp; Just make sure you know what you&#39;re getting.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n    <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scendera@...\"\n title=\"scendera@...\">Fire on High</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, September 29, 2003 3:42 \n    AM</div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Computer \n    Question</div>\n    <div><br></div><tt>Yes.
