Well I don&#39;t know about you but the sex thing is definitely more<br/>\nimportant than EQ! ;) Watching animated characters bump into each other<br/>\njust doesn&#39;t do it for me. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a good way to put it, I may think about trying that angle, (not<br/>\nthe sex but the closer together part!), I know she would really enjoy<br/>\nplaying once she got started.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually play on Solsek Ro but I might do the server change option.<br/>\nThere is another player that won&#39;t leave me alone even after I&#39;ve asked<br/>\nhim several times and petitioned. I don&#39;t play EQ to &quot;hook up&quot; I play to<br/>\nhave fun and do my little quests. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n Message: 2<br/>\n   Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2002 16:51:23 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n   From: Toni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silly_girl4ever@...\">silly_girl4ever@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Top Everquest Cities?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDENVER ROCKS =D  (gee,  can you tell I am from Denver??)
