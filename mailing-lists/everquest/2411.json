A","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1880427504\">I&#39;m afraid I have nothing good to say about Legends. I subscibed, and on the <br/>\nconfirmation screen it said I would be billed March 24, 2002.<br/>\nI thought GREAT! A free month. So I had my 26 war transfered over and tried <br/>\nto play. HAHAHA Legends is for people who want to be in a large guild of <br/>\n&#39;uber&#39; people, cause the stuff that is new and great, you can only go after <br/>\nif you are high level. I don&#39;t care what Verant says. The good stuff is for <br/>\nhigh level chars. Period. They revamped Cazic Thule zone, and its all Level <br/>\n40+ chars..I don&#39;t know what else they did. But I wasn&#39;t impressed, though I <br/>\nguess if I was level 60 with a bunch of level 60 friends it might be ok.<br/>\nTHEN....I got a notice from my bank. Now, I only use this account to pay <br/>\nEverQuest fees (I hate banks) so I only put 10 bucks a month in, plus maybe <br/>\n10 more to use if I need a soda at the store or something and I don&#39;t have <br/>\ncash on me. The notice said I had been billed 39.95 (USD) for EverQuest on <br/>\nFebruary 27, 2002. Thank Goodness for overdraft protection...though I get <br/>\ncharged a 22 dollar fee for every transaction that they pay. So, I had <br/>\nbought a soda, and EverQuest went through first...so I had 2 bounced debits <br/>\nand 2- $22 fees.....I&#39;m minus about 80 dollars in my account and our only <br/>\nincome is from grants my hubby gets to go to school. I called EQ, they said <br/>\nsorry, but since the character got transfered over, we can&#39;t do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I filed a formal complaint against Verant Interactive with the Federal <br/>\nTrade Commission, because they, in effect, stole my money, and caused me big <br/>\nproblems with my bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT I&#39;m such a damn addict I find myself unable to totally cancel my account <br/>\n/sigh....I feel like a hypocrit, but what can I do?<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Synthea Firestorm<br/>\n40 Druidess<br/>\nSirens of the Storm - Drinal Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Richard Skelton&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:richards@...\">richards@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EverQuest] Legends<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 6 Mar 2002 15:33:01 -0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Legend is $40 a month.  ALL new content in Everquest will go into Legend <br/>\n&gt;first, and normal servers will suffer because of it, only getting new <br/>\n&gt;updates as they filter out from Legend.  The new content and improvements <br/>\n&gt;will obviously come through to regular servers slower than in the past, in <br/>\n&gt;order for Verant to justify the high subscription to Legend and keep those <br/>\n&gt;few elite and rich players interested.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You might gather I dont subscribe to the Legend server :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rykk Bloodfang<br/>\n&gt;52 Monk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
