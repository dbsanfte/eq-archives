I went to login to check my email and<br/>\napparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea why.<br/>\nWell, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with my<br/>\nbrother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not I want<br/>\nto bother renewing because they will probably charge me a higher price.<br/>\nI had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me off that they<br/>\npulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an angry letter of<br/>\ncomplaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>\nARG.
