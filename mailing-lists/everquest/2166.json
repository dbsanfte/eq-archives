You may not be able to outrun some of the<br/>\nother mobs though. But camo is good to avoid goblins and a few others. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot saying you should feel completely safe when in camo. But some giants<br/>\ncan&#39;t see through camo. I know bc I took a ranger through that zone with<br/>\ncamo and all of the giants I encountered conned indifferent. Now, that was<br/>\njust my experience. I know that there are mobs that do see thru invis.
