In my experience in EQ I <br/>\ntend to get my first 6 aa&#39;s at level 51.  The first 3 I spend on run 3 <br/>\non any class of character that I start.  The next 3,if it is melee I <br/>\nspend on regen 3, if a caster I spend on either wisdom or intelligence <br/>\ndepending upon the class.  Then I level up to level 60 and work my <br/>\naa&#39;s again there.  I have been known to work aa&#39;s up to 100 at level <br/>\n60, the aa xp seems to move a little faster at level 60. As an example <br/>\nin Sol Ro tower at level 60 you will get an aa about every 8 to 10 <br/>\nkills.  I will say again the unrest instancezone off of butcher block <br/>\nis great xp. Easy single pulls and you have a chance at a nice upgrade <br/>\nat the end. You just have to make sure that your average level is <br/>\nwithin 2 levels of the lowest member of the group.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
