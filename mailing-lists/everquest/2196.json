I got it on track <br/>\nand responded. I lead a group hunting a rare drop to their quarry, <br/>\nand made 50pp plus in tips. Took maybe five minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nA short time later I am in the tunnel mouth of ec to sell some of the <br/>\nloot given as tips, when a player asked for a port. Having done very <br/>\nwell I felt generous, so did a free port to bb. In bb I got a call <br/>\nfor a wc port, party of two. Did the job. 100pp tip. Not bad at all. <br/>\nMy most profitable session yet. It was quite fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
