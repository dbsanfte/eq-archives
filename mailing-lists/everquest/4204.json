They have done the level 50+ thing, started new characters and<br/>\ntwinked them to the hilt, and now, since that isn&#39;t much of a challenge,<br/>\nthey (myself included) are starting new characters from scratch, without<br/>\ntwinking. Most races and classes now have fairly simple &quot;newbie armor&quot;<br/>\nquests where you can earn a complete set (8 pieces, if you do the bracers<br/>\ntwice) of not too shabby armor by level 10, including a magical weapon, and<br/>\nit&#39;s fun, at least it is to me. I know a level 40 cleric that is still<br/>\nwearing quite a bit of his newbie armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will still see &quot;lvl 7 Wiz LFG&quot; being shouted in the newbie zones -- in<br/>\nother words, it&#39;s still not difficult finding a group at lower levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nA number of people that I know have left EQ for DAOC and other games, only<br/>\nto come back, because those games were somehow &quot;lacking&quot; compared to EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:odd_yager@...\">odd_yager@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 10, 2003 4:40 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Need some opinions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hey everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I need some help on my next MPORPG purchase. I played EQ since Beta<br/>\n&gt; and quit about 2 and half years ago (college took priority heh) and<br/>\n&gt; now that I have secured a somewhat stable career, I&#39;m planning to hit<br/>\n&gt; online RPGing again. Question is, being that EQ has been out for 5<br/>\n&gt; years, is it too late to come back and start anew? Meaning am I going<br/>\n&gt; to look ridiculous (prolly will regardless) being the only lvl 6 guy<br/>\n&gt; on the server in cloth and using fine steel? Or should I look for<br/>\n&gt; another MRORPG game? How is Camelot? Or Neverwinter Nights?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yager<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
