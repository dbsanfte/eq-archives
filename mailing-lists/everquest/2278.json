Have the bard load<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Kazumi&#39;s note of preservation&quot; (this is a group da song, 3 tick<br/>\n </span></blockquote>duration).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Instruct the druid to say when he starts casting his port spell, have the<br/>\n&gt; bard start Kazumi immediately after druid starts. Those that want to get<br/>\n&gt; ported, click off the Kazumi&#39;s note effect icon (thus removing da), druid<br/>\n&gt; keeps it.
