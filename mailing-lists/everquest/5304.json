They were all done in /Say so they didn&#39;t <br/>\ntake over the zone.  There were a few shouts to warn off people from <br/>\nthe area before it started.  And they were short!<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, we all got drunk after every one!  It was great hearing all the <br/>\ngibberish.  No deaths though.

Weddings held in /shout or /ooc are <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a bad idea.  Plus it defeats the entire reason why channels were <br/>\nmade.  Anybody who wants to attend the wedding should just join the <br/>\nwedding channel.  Stop spamming up the public chat with crap people <br/>\ndont necessarily care about except who&#39;s involved.  Also, the <br/>\nwaterfall in Thurg is a bad choice of places.  Granted it&#39;s beautiful <br/>\nto look at, but its a high traffic area.  They should expect people <br/>\nto constantly be running through there.  Especially for the reason <br/>\nyou stated, training mobs to zone to escape.  Everyone does it, <br/>\nnobody&#39;s innocent, it&#39;s part of the game.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   Personally, I wouldn&#39;t think too much of it because there&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>nothing they can really do to you to get revenge.
