LOL I do like the play on the astral <br/>\nsigns, thats pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Hey, I&#39;m going to try and organize a small thing for this weekend <br/>\ninvolving Nagafeen&#39;s Lair. Four of our Rangers (One is a little young <br/>\nyet) need an item (a burnt sash) from there to get one of their lvl 50 <br/>\nspells. It&#39;s not of a &quot;raid&quot; status but I tried it yesterday with a good <br/>\nfriend from Jaggedpine Defenders and we were just getting smoked in <br/>\nthere. What sucked most of all was that everything was light blue and <br/>\ngreen at the beginning but they hit hard and fast and they respawned <br/>\nfast too. So we just decided to get a group together hopefully this <br/>\nweekend and try it. He had a monk as well and was there trying to get a <br/>\npiece for his epic but we didn&#39;t have much luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n    So if you would like to join us this next weekend and maybe pick up <br/>\nyour item as well for your monk (If you don&#39;t already have it) you are <br/>\nmore than welcome to join us. It&#39;s still in the &quot;seeing who all is <br/>\navailable&quot; stage so I can&#39;t guarantee it will happen. If we can get <br/>\neveryone there it looks like we will have the following 3 Rangers (2 for <br/>\nsure), 2 Monks (including you if you want to join) and either a cleric <br/>\nor mage.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Let me know if you would like to join in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessed be!<br/>\nDurgaa<br/>\nGuild Leader of Mystic Crusaders<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
