We waited patiently for the patch that was supposed to<br/>\nbe our salvation. Instead, what we received was armor quests that were 10<br/>\ntimes the length and 5 times more costly than any of the quest of any other<br/>\nclass. And for all of that the armor stinks. Class specific plate armor for<br/>\nthe Paladin has less AC than that of the chain worn by the ranger. Paladins<br/>\nare the &quot;Holy Knight&quot; counterpart to the ranger. Yet, with the last 3<br/>\npatches, the Ranger has been augmented so that he has more AC even though he<br/>\ncan wear no platemail. He also has higher skill caps, does nearly twice the<br/>\ndamage in battle, has spell equivalents to most of the Paladins spells yet<br/>\nnot confined to undead. Ensnare is far more effective that root. Several<br/>\nother spells and buffs of the druid class aren&#39;t nerfed , level wise, as<br/>\nwith<br/>\nthe paladin. The ranger can track. Whereas the paladin can point himself in<br/>\nthe direction of the nearest undead, unless of course if there is a pet in<br/>\nthe area. Now to the arguements.<br/>\n�<br/>\n�</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
