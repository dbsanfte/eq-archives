Did it twice, <br/>\nguess what? Clurg&#39;s goon didn&#39;t kill me this time, but Clurg gave me <br/>\nsome exp. and NO stein! I am going to do this quest again and again <br/>\njust to get the book. Heck, giving the book to Gregor gives you 4PP <br/>\nand exp! What can I do to raise faction with the Ogres so Clurg will <br/>\ngive me my stein?!<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple nights ago I thought I&#39;d get my jeweler&#39;s kit out of the  <br/>\nbank that I bought 2 months ago and combine a Velium Ruby with an <br/>\nEnchanted Silver bar. It said &quot;you can not use this container for <br/>\nthis&quot; or something like that. I had thrown 5 training points into <br/>\njewel making when I was level 5 so I figured I&#39;d try it out. The I <br/>\nbought a Lupis stone (I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called) and put it in <br/>\nthe container with the bar and it made a necklace! I was so excited <br/>\nLOL. Ok, so what do you all suggest I try to make next where the <br/>\ncomponents are somewhat cheap to buy because I am broke? Also, I want <br/>\nto buy the &quot;Enchant Silver&quot; spell but can&#39;t seem to find it. I am in <br/>\nQeynos but none of those vendors sell it...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is long-winded, sorry :) Have a great day everyone.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
