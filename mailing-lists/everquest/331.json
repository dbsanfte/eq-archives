This would be really nice<br/>\nbecause our guild smith wouldn&#39;t have to buy molds.  So if you have<br/>\nany info on pottery please share or if you&#39;ve seen any guides on a web<br/>\npage that would be nice too since I haven&#39;t found any on EQvault and<br/>\nStratics.<br/>\n<br/>\nTetasha Silvermoon of the Order of Deus Vult on Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
