It&#39;s refreshing to see there are still newbies <br/>\nabout.  Brings back memories of my younger days. /sniff<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t been to Felwithe in a while, but every city has a person in <br/>\ntheir guild area that gives out a quest for &quot;Newbie&quot; armor and <br/>\nweapons.  Just hail everyone.  When you see something in brackets <br/>\nthat is the response you /say to them.  The right person will give <br/>\nyou a box, then you ask for patterns and they list the items you need <br/>\nto collect.  Write it all down.  This is much better armor than I had <br/>\nat that level!  It will sustain you until your 20&#39;s at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to go between Felwithe and Kelethin just follow the road.  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot too dangerous.  Just don&#39;t fall off of the platforms!<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\nPathfinder of Tunare<br/>\nTerris-Thule, Summoners of the Realm<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=761750\">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=761750</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
