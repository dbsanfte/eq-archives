I&#39;ve really been leaning torward a keyboard with a built in trackball/pad simply for ease of portability and use when playing. I&#39;ve also seen the Nostromo SpeedPad N52 and have been wondering about it as well. I was wondering if anyone has tried this with EQ and how well it works or what is your setup? Have any of you tried that Zboard? It has a setup for EQ and EQ2 among other games out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nNostromo SpeedPad: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/gaming/68a2/\">http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/gaming/68a2/</a><br/>\nZboard: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zboard.com/us/products/products_main.htm\">http://www.zboard.com/us/products/products_main.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nThis is where i would say something profound that  may<br/>\nhelp end world hunger or solve global conflict.
