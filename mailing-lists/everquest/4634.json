I forget what level you are but 5-6<br/>\nnukes will most definitely kill mana as well as draw<br/>\naggro where then you won&#39;t be able to get the mob off<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a mage and a druid and after months of not<br/>\nplaying my mage, I started him up again only to die<br/>\nseveral times.  I was getting to caught up in the a<br/>\nsimilar pattern where I was nuking too much and once<br/>\nyou get a mob that hits for 75 per shot on ya, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t last tooo long.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the second best pets in the game and should<br/>\nlet the pets do most of the work.  I remember being<br/>\nunder 25 and being able to handle mostly yellow mobs<br/>\nand I am not a twinked char.  Once you get Renew<br/>\nsummoning , learn to use it wisely.  YOu can heal your<br/>\npet for 200 hp and sit while watching its health.<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly suggest if you are having trouble to get a<br/>\npartner or group for a while.  A druid or cleric is a<br/>\ngreat team where you can both buff your pet and they<br/>\ncan heal it as well as you.  Both with Kei would be<br/>\ndangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us know if you need more , dont&#39; be afraid to try<br/>\nstrategies, find one that fits your playing style.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to email me off list and I will be more than<br/>\nhappy to help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Kittin LovesYou &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KittinLovesYou@...\">KittinLovesYou@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve run out of mana on kei.  my druid (22) is<br/>\n&gt; always with kei and is the healer of the group<br/>\n&gt; (normally).  She sits around and buffs and heals. <br/>\n&gt; my mage evne with kei will run out of mana with<br/>\n&gt; about 5-6 nukes and DS&#39;s.  I must say, for my druid<br/>\n&gt; being on kei since the beginning of her creation,<br/>\n&gt; her med is still almost maxed, and her combat skills<br/>\n&gt; are still good.  amazing waht you can do after you<br/>\n&gt; learn the game a bit better.<br/>\n&gt; Kittin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Kent King &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:propellerheadus@...\">propellerheadus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2003 06:39:52 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EverQuest] some encouragement  for a<br/>\n&gt; humble newb<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Get Paid...
