We have have become fascinated with all <br/>\naspects of the game. The role-playing, the building up of characters, <br/>\nthe economy of the game, the way people interact online, etc... We <br/>\nhope to explore all these areas of the game by interviewing players, <br/>\nspouses, children, parents and even the EQ developers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe plan on shooting over the next couple of months. We live in Los <br/>\nAngeles and are prepared to travel around the country to conduct our <br/>\ninterviews. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf interested, pease reply to our email eqdocfilm&lt;at&gt;yahoo&lt;dot&gt;com and <br/>\nprovide us with your age and location (city/state), level and guild <br/>\naffiliation, and how long you&#39;ve been playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nNina and Andy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
