Once I have about<br/>\n5 or more I wait til they are all close to me and cast Word of Pain. Then<br/>\nThey all die instantly. So then I gather up their pelts. some of which can<br/>\nbe turned in for quests.<br/>\nI do something similar with my wizard and orc pawns in Freeport. I use a low<br/>\nlvl dd spell to lure pawns to me and get a whole bunch around me. This is<br/>\ngood when I am encumbered and cannot chase after them. Once I get them<br/>\ngathered around I use an AE spell. if they don&#39;t all die, I stand in place<br/>\nand attack the ones that are close to me. If they run I turn to another one<br/>\nand fight it. Eventulaly they all come back to me. I keep fighting til they<br/>\nare all laying dead around me. then I loot their corpses and gate back to<br/>\nHallard&#39;s to deliver pawn picks.<br/>\nGot my faction up to apprehensive so far.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you guys have any strategies that you use?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Like me...my current fav character is Sarakan...a level 12 druid<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and my best strategy is to fear kite young kodiaks in the commons<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and at later levels, I&#39;ll be grouping with a rogue so that he can back<br/>\n </span></blockquote>stab<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; the running animal :&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       Yahoo!
