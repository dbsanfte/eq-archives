For some reason<br/>\nthe abbreviations annoy the hell out of some people. I can stand it to some<br/>\nextent but sometimes it annoys me. :-)<br/>\nI do use some abbreviations like bc when typing, but try not to have every<br/>\nword in a sentence abbreviated. Well, it works in groups when you have to<br/>\ntype really fast. :-)<br/>\nCool. I vaguely remember 9th grade. It sucked. lol.<br/>\nI bet it&#39;s fun being on summer vacation. :-)<br/>\nWhat server do you play on?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok then you all want me to type with good grammer  ok I will do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>so.......while i am typeing email&#39;s to you all at least. But my friends have<br/>\nprobably gotten used to me typeing that way so i am going to keep typeing on<br/>\neq. But ok see .......am I typeing ok so far?? any way, I just  think it is<br/>\neasier and faster so people dont have to wait forever to hear a response<br/>\nwhen they want it and especially while they are excited...am I correct? I am<br/>\n14 years old and going on 9th grade, k-6 is elementry for me and 7 and 8 are<br/>\nmiddle school and 9-12 is high school..........so I have been going to<br/>\nschool around 10 or 11 years, my mom put me in school when I was 5 years<br/>\nold. Ok is everything all cleared up and all or does some one else have a<br/>\nproblem or challenge for me?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  c ya l8er......oops i mean see you all later-----lori<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I thought this was kind of funny actually.  I don&#39;t recall ever taking<br/>\n </span></blockquote>spelling after the elementary school levels.  From Grades 9 - 12 they<br/>\nassumed that if we made it that far then we already knew how to spell.

It&#39;s<br/>\nbest to learn proper spelling and grammar skills first and make them a<br/>\nhabit.  Then you can use your internet-ese for fun.  Worst thing you could<br/>\ndo is turn in a research paper for your professor that&#39;s full of<br/>\nabbreviations and misspellings, or perhaps be making a big presentation at<br/>\nwork and have that kind of spelling and grammar.  Nobody would take you<br/>\nseriously.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are a few reasons why people type like that: 1.  Because they don&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>know how to type properly so they can&#39;t keep up with how fast the internet<br/>\nchat room is moving, 2.  Because they really don&#39;t know how to spell or how<br/>\nto use proper grammar, and/or 3.  They think it&#39;s cool when it&#39;s really not.<br/>\nWhich one are you?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You learned to spell for a reason.  You say you&#39;re good at it.
