Especially when it comes epic Raids.  As one of the <br/>\npremier Sk&#39;s in my guild on Saryn,  I&#39;m needed  in regards to <br/>\ntanking, Fearing on occassion and if we need to go to aplace with <br/>\nalot of undead like the Epic raid to The Hole this past weekend IVU <br/>\nwas needed to get to where 2 of the Epic mobs spawned so we didnt <br/>\nhave a bunch of casualties. alos using hat Evocation skill is a <br/>\ndefinate plus when using the Ward Undead line of spells.  Also to a <br/>\nminor degree so far  with FD we can stay at the pull spot and be the <br/>\nspy network to give out the all clear if everyone in the group is <br/>\ndead  so the Clerics if they have not zoned or logged can come in and <br/>\nrezz folks<br/>\n<br/>\nMonks are great for pulling when it comes to breaking agro&#39;s.  Using <br/>\nFD  9 times out of 10 they can sucessfully  break the agro train so <br/>\nthe rest of us can go after one particular mob. <br/>\n<br/>\nClerics obviously are a plus when it comes to heals and rezzes if <br/>\nthings go completely awry<br/>\n<br/>\nRangers and Druids have that nice tracking ability to let folks know <br/>\nif the objective has spawned or not.  Not to mention the dot&#39;s, <br/>\nsnares and roots they have<br/>\n<br/>\nNecros  have this nice little spell called summoned corpse. if things <br/>\nget hairy and peeps who were not able to get out in time need to get <br/>\na rezz and their corpse happens to be deep into the zone with a <br/>\ngazillion mobs between the zoneline and their corpse (CT, ToFS, The <br/>\nHole, Befallen are prime examples) If the prson  manages to make it <br/>\nback tot he zone nekked then the necro can target the PC and summon <br/>\nthe corpse.  admittedly Sk have the lesser summon corpse spell but <br/>\nihave not used it yet and still can&#39;t find whre Ineed to get the <br/>\ncoffin Ineed for that spell seeing as Neriak still doenst have them <br/>\nhehe I may ned to go into Paineel for it.  Plus necros can fear cast <br/>\nIVU and also have other nice damaging spells at teir disposal.  and <br/>\nDMF is to die for when you need to swim to someplace and you dont <br/>\nhave  a good  underwater spell not to mentionletting you see invis <br/>\nand float at the same time<br/>\n<br/>\nShamans have a lot of nice spells to cast on peeps and some can be <br/>\nstacked with other peeps buffs.  not to mention they have some nice <br/>\ndot&#39;s  and back up roots  if the Druids are unable to root.<br/>\n<br/>\nPallies make great tanks as well as back up healers and at higher <br/>\nlevels can do  limited rezes. buffs are of the lower end Cleric line <br/>\nbut if no cleric is around for heal&#39;s buffs and rezzes, are you gonna <br/>\ncomplain? I ain&#39;t cause a pally buff/heal could mean the difference <br/>\nbetween life and death.<br/>\n<br/>\nChanter&#39;s have ths nice mezz line of spells as well as charm.  Ever <br/>\nbeen to a raid or in group where you have a couple of mobs on your <br/>\nrear end and you happen to see a mob fighitng another mob?  Thank <br/>\nthat Chanter for that.  And their  Clarity line of spells are a <br/>\ngodsend for  all of us mana users<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of Meddings and such dont forgett eh bards with their mana <br/>\nsong that goes quite well in conjuntion with Clarity.  also their <br/>\nRegen song goes great in conjunction with  some of teh Regen spells <br/>\nsome peeps (shammy  comes to mind right off the bat) have<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you have the Rogues.  Not only do they tank well but they also <br/>\nhave this nice  backstab ability that can do some serious damage to <br/>\nthe mob giving that nice death from behind effect<br/>\n<br/>\nMages and Wizards have some great nuke spells that come quite handy <br/>\nwhen an especially difficult mob is encountered and the pally lay on <br/>\nhands is used up the sk harm touch is used up and your healers are <br/>\noom <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd last but not least oyu have the Warrior.  The premier Tank <br/>\nclass.  You need a tanks to help take down a mob call a warrior.  not <br/>\nonly do they hit hard but the can do some nice crits as well as kick <br/>\nharder than a mule and igf I remember correctly they can duel wield <br/>\nand double attack thus making them a force to be reckoned with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy apologies if I did not mention the Beastlord.  I have not come <br/>\nacross one yet at the time of this writing so i have very little <br/>\n(read as none =()information as to how they fit in the scheme of <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the above of course is based on my personal encounters with <br/>\neach of these classes.  Whether my encounter be in group or based on <br/>\nthe chars I have of a particular class.<br/>\n<br/>\nCynfyn MacCulloch 47 DESK<br/>\nHalyburton Bearhugger 22 BarbShm<br/>\nSaltaque 12HIEEnch<br/>\nQapmoc 11HalfElfRng<br/>\nOroblram 8HuWar<br/>\nDefender of the Faith<br/>\nSaryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;erik&quot; &lt;naslund@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is the kinda thing that gives people the wrong impression about<br/>\n&gt; classes.  Shaman are extremely important to a raid, from slowing a <br/>\nmob to<br/>\n&gt; giving melee some excellent stat buffs.  High level Rangers put out <br/>\nobscene<br/>\n&gt; amounts of damage and are able to tank mobs that aggro on casters, <br/>\nwhile<br/>\n&gt; being about to almost immedialely reduce aggro when needed.  Mages <br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; excellent for mana regen (mod rods) and CotH.  Druids are excellent<br/>\n&gt; secondary healers on raid, throwing in heals between CHs.  Monks <br/>\nand SK&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; are excellent indoor pullers (breaking Fear is terribly hard <br/>\nwithout a Monk<br/>\n&gt; or SK to scout).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There really isn&#39;t one single class that is not needed in a raid <br/>\nsituation. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
