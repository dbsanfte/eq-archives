If your corpse had nothing on it, it may have <br/>\ndisappeared, but your own anwswer is most likely. You misplaced your <br/>\ncorpse. Dying at levels below five is set to be low-penalty (you lose <br/>\nvery little and get food and water when you come back) to make the <br/>\nearly learning a bit easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are tools to find corpses, sold by merchants. However, it is <br/>\nbest to learn to die with finding your corpse in mind. Try to look <br/>\naround at landmarks when death is clearly coming. Try to be near some <br/>\nobject you can find easily when you come back. And unless you don&#39;t <br/>\nmind having to do this often, learn to fight in such a way as to <br/>\nseldom die. Some gamers like to take the risks leading to frequent <br/>\ndeaths, but I prefer to hunt with care and die seldom. Seems more in <br/>\nthe spirit of the game to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\nIf --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Minigamer&quot; &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th level Druid in the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>city of Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, with others, I got <br/>\nkilled by an Orc Centurian and when I returned to get my corpse, <br/>\nnothing was there.
