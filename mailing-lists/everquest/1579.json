My opinion on the matter is<br/>\nunmoved.  I too have played this game prior to its<br/>\nrelease, and have yet to see a single hacked account<br/>\noutside of the exchange of passwords to in-game<br/>\nfriends.  I&#39;m not saying it does not occur, however,<br/>\nyou simply stated that it happened.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1. How did his/her account become hacked..? <br/>\n2. When did they find out..? <br/>\n3. Who reported it, leading it to become banned? <br/>\n/shrugs  <br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t quote percentages cause I have none, but you<br/>\ncan be assured that a vast majority of them will fall<br/>\nunder the category of players handing their account<br/>\ninformation over to another.  When you choose to take<br/>\nthat path you accept the risk of loss that follows.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a retired guide, and I enjoyed helping players<br/>\ndeal with situations cause by the few bugs that still<br/>\nremain.  Yet Verant&#39;s policy today is the same as it<br/>\nwas before..  You have to treat everyone the same,<br/>\nconsidering each petition dealing with loss of<br/>\nequipment.. questioning the truthfulness of the claims<br/>\nset forth.  You would be surprised how many players<br/>\nare out to scam EQ, verant is merely trying to<br/>\nmaintain the integrity of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you must know.. I read the posting under an AO<br/>\nForum titled &quot; Why AO will kill EQ &quot;.  If they only<br/>\ntook off their blinders and realized AO GMs will<br/>\nfollow the same procedures. =)  <br/>\n<br/>\nLesson Learned:  Keep your information private. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
