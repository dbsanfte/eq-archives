After \n  some<br>research, I found that the reason I am not hitting as<br>much as \n  others is because I have been switching<br>between 2HS and 1HS weapons to \n  increase the skills of<br>each attribute.&nbsp; <br><br>Example: My skill in \n  both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br>attack is at like 152.&nbsp; If I were to just \n  use 1HS<br>let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br><br>I have \n  proved this because now that I am using the 1HS<br>more, the skill is close to \n  30 and my ATK rating is<br>close to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is still \n  at<br>152.<br><br><br>Would you continue to alternate both weapon types \n  or<br>would you just pick one and go with \n  it?<br><br>THanks<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do \n  You Yahoo!?<br>Sign up for SBC Yahoo!
