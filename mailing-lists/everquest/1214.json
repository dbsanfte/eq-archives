I hand out nice weapons and decent<br/>\narmor to newbies like they&#39;re candy, and I genuinely<br/>\nenjoy helping people (That&#39;s a big reason I chose a<br/>\ndruid as my main).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, like almost all druids, I have times when<br/>\nnewbies and/or experienced players come up to me and<br/>\nask for things without saying please or when I&#39;m very<br/>\nbusy (like for instance the cleric just left the<br/>\ngroup, we haven&#39;t found another healer, my heals blow,<br/>\nbut I am the primary healer until another is located).<br/>\nI have a standard hotkey set up for those who ask for<br/>\nSoW or whatever rudely (the &quot;Can I get a SoW&quot; irks me<br/>\nno end): <br/>\n<br/>\nBeggar: Can I get a SoW?<br/>\nNymue: I&#39;m sorry, I do not comply with rude requests.<br/>\nNymue: Have a nice day!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does not work. They hang around begging, saying<br/>\nplease, and so on and so forth. One guy told me today,<br/>\n&quot;Damn druids ruin the game.&quot; Lovely.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my poll today is to collect people&#39;s favorite ways<br/>\nof denying requests when they don&#39;t want to/don&#39;t have<br/>\nthe time/are in a group/don&#39;t feel like complying. If<br/>\nanyone has an amusing, polite, or snotty reply to<br/>\nshare with me I&#39;d love to hear it - I&#39;m going to set<br/>\nmy favorites up as hotkeys, so please don&#39;t share it<br/>\nunless you don&#39;t mind me copying it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s assistance,<br/>\nNymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br/>\nLvl 47 Wood Elf Druid<br/>\nCazic-Thule Server <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nNymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br/>\nWood Elf Druid, Cazic-Thule Server<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
