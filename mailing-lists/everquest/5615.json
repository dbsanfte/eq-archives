There<br/>\nare some nice ones dropping below $200, if your budget allows. Large<br/>\non-card memory seems to be very important in this game. From what I<br/>\nhave culled from this group and others like it, upgrading the video<br/>\ncard as often as is affordable is the best way to maintain or even<br/>\nimprove performance as the game evolves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are constantly put in the position of having to upgrade our<br/>\nmachines if we want to play online games. I would be out of this if my<br/>\nson did not have the disposable income to keep up a nice machine. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t seem to justify the upgrade (more replacement) of this machine<br/>\nto my wife and financial manager. Somehow having to get a new car,<br/>\npaint the house, finance other repairs, and such preclude a kick-ass<br/>\nmachine for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep access to my son&#39;s machine by giving him free rent. With<br/>\nhousing costs the way they are around here, he will stay forever.<br/>\nBwa-ha-ha!<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that dx9 isn&#39;t so great.
