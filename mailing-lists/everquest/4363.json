Unfortunately the mage that<br/>\nwas<br/>\n  supposed to come was a no-show. So the raid had to be cancelled as we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t<br/>\n  have enough people to fight their way in.<br/>\n  I then realized that I don&#39;t even know any high level mages who are not<br/>\nkos<br/>\n  in chardok (and who have the ability to summon people to them).<br/>\n  If you know anyone who has such a character or are such a person, please<br/>\n  please please let me know. I will give free rezzes with my click stick<br/>\nonce<br/>\n  I get it.<br/>\n  Thanks in advance.<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su aka Conwyn 54 cleric<br/>\n  The Tribunal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
