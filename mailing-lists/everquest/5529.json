Well when I came back all my characters were<br/>\nnaked and all they had in their inventorys were trader&#39;s sacks.  Of course<br/>\nthey were in the bazaar.

Multi Users?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am back in school and working full time so I don&#39;t have time for all my<br/>\nhobbies.  I was thinking of canceling my EQ account for the semester and<br/>\npicking it back up later.  I am only 2 semester from graduation (then I will<br/>\nhave a degree showing I can do what I have been doing for the past 8 years).<br/>\nHow long after you cancel your account will your stuff get erased?  I would<br/>\nhate to start back up later and find all my loot was gone.  While paying for<br/>\nthe account would not break me I just hate the feeling that I am wasting<br/>\nmoney that could be better spent on my RC racing hobby.  Sorry, won&#39;t give<br/>\nup RC for EQ.  It gets me out of the house and with real people, and sadly<br/>\nis the second most physical activity I engage in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did have another idea.  Let a friend use the account and just tell him to<br/>\nstay off Tunare where my guys are.  While not any cheaper it would help me<br/>\nwith the &quot;waste&quot; aspect.  What happens if he is in the game and I try and<br/>\nlog in for a quick game?  Will it give me an error, kick him out, suspend<br/>\nthe account, alert the Sony SWAT team?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!  Thanks for help with this in advance and for all the help I have<br/>\ngotten previously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
