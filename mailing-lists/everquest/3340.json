If you were on The Tribunal I would buff you up and protect you with<br/>\nmy lvl 52 cleric to help you kill that little rat bastard!<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi gang,<br/>\n&gt; I just wanted to take a moment and thank any and all of you on this list<br/>\n&gt; I may have come across during my Warrior&#39;s, (Genmay), travels to and<br/>\n&gt; from Ak&#39;Anon and Felwith. The SOW&#39;s were perfect, it makes the trips so<br/>\n&gt; much faster! As for the extra buffs those were wonderful too! Lately<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve had a thing going on with a large plagued rat over in Steamfront<br/>\n&gt; who seems to find me every time and kills me! With the buffs I can make<br/>\n&gt; it to the gates of the city and the guards take care of him. I swear<br/>\n&gt; when I get a couple of levels higher I&#39;m going to defeat that darn rat!<br/>\n&gt; ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Happy hunting!<br/>\n&gt; Durgaa: 9th level Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n&gt; Shizney: 5th level Gnome Mage<br/>\n&gt; Genmay: 6th level Gnome Warrior<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
