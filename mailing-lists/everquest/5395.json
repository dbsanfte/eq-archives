I finally did it!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I failed a combine a couple times and lost two runed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sea shells (which were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the most expensive thing I had to buy for it-- I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried hunting in SG but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t have any luck). I got my JC to 173, my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tailoring to 176, fletching to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 180, brewing to 184, pottery to 154, and smithing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 112. I got impatient on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the pottery and just asked someone to put the water<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the velium powder<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (made from the runed sea shell and a small brick of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; velium in a mortar and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pestle-- no fail combine) in a pottery wheel and got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my Unfired Rune. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fired the rune. I bought a geerlok gemsetter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Borrowed a geerlok planing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tool for my fletching for the combines. and borrowed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a geerlok sewing kit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for the final combine. Had C3 on and success!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I now have my Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now I need to work on JC and Smithing some more for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my 8th shawl...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Version: 6.0.544 / Virus Database: 338 - Release<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: 11/25/2003<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And on the eighth day God said, &quot;O.K.
