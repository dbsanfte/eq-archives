Everyone can<br/>\nmalee the kill to get experience. EverQuest is a grouping oriented game, but<br/>\nat the beginning levels, it is just not worth it to group. Every class can<br/>\nsolo the first levels. Once it becomes harder to kill the blue mobs you are<br/>\nfighting, then you can start looking for other PC to group with. But once<br/>\nyour druid gets a bit higher, you will not malee the mob, you&#39;ll be<br/>\nmeditating to bomb or heal. You will still malee at higher levels to kill<br/>\nthe mobs once they get to the point where they are fleeing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 3, you really don&#39;t need a decent weapon, stick with your club<br/>\nuntil you get level 6. Pocket all the coppers and sellable items from your<br/>\nkill. Once it gets too hard to kill these blues solo, your spells will have<br/>\na better effect to kill. Druids can solo from level 1 to 60 without ever<br/>\ngrouping one time. Do not fall behind on your spells. Buy them and use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt your level you really do not need to venture out too far from the guards,<br/>\nunless there are other newbies there and you are having a hard time finding<br/>\nblue mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSistily<br/>\n59 Gnomish Warrior<br/>\nTunare Server <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\trlebeau65 [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">rlebeau65@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tMonday, December 31, 2001 9:07 AM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\t[EverQuest] Newbie has questions<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHi,<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have just bought the Everquest trilogy box and have played a few <br/>\n\ttimes.  I have found a few helpful people out there but it seems<br/>\nmost <br/>\n\tare playing solo. Is this normal?  They suggest grouping so that is <br/>\n\tmy first question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNext, I am having trouble getting money to get decent weapons.<br/>\n\tI am a level 3 Druid and only have a club.  One guy gave me some <br/>\n\tmoney but it wasn&#39;t much.  He suggested buying more spells, but I <br/>\n\treally would like a good weapon.  Dealing 1-3 points of damage just <br/>\n\tisn&#39;t cutting it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLastly for now, should I be starting with a fighter type until I <br/>\n\treally get use the the game and interface.  I really love wizards<br/>\nand <br/>\n\tthose type of characters but understand if playing a warrior makes<br/>\nit <br/>\n\teasier.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI always get confused on where I am going. I think I venture too far<br/>\n<br/>\n\tout of the city area.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThank you for letting the newbie post?  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t------------------------ Yahoo!
