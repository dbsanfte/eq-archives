I think that simply there are<br/>\n&quot;problems&quot; with the code as it is designed to determine who gets credit for<br/>\nthe kill.  I think that minor not drastic changes are in order.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless - you are a bit out of date in that Verant has acknowledged the<br/>\nproblem and will be addressing it.  They stated (and I&#39;m paraphrasing) that<br/>\nthe current system is such that it rewards solo over groups and they want to<br/>\nchange it to tilt towards group - since their philosophy of the game is to<br/>\npromote grouping.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I see it - the main problem is that it only looks at damage against<br/>\nthe mob and doesn&#39;t incorporate the damage that the players receive...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\nLevel 18 Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Avron &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avron@...\">avron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 30, 1999 2:50 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Survey....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Avron &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avron@...\">avron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would like to urge everyone to submit your vote on the survey<br/>\n&gt; concerning kill stealing if you haven&#39;t already done so..
