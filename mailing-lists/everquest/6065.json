My heart is tired,<br/>\n&gt; but I must not <br/>\n&gt; falter. I met my comrades on the field. Still and<br/>\n&gt; quiet. Only the <br/>\n&gt; crickets give evidence of life beyond our keep.<br/>\n&gt; Today will be another <br/>\n&gt; rough day. I bolster my faith, surrounding myself<br/>\n&gt; with it like a <br/>\n&gt; piece of impregnable armor. I know that many will go<br/>\n&gt; out to meet <br/>\n&gt; their death and only a few will return. For all our<br/>\n&gt; sakes, I must put <br/>\n&gt; that aside and mourn later. For now it is war. I am<br/>\n&gt; needed to give <br/>\n&gt; heart, faith and healing to my comrades. If I must,<br/>\n&gt; I will help as <br/>\n&gt; well. Not that someone like me could do much. I pray<br/>\n&gt; to Tunare for <br/>\n&gt; strength and guidance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All communications are in and the report is not<br/>\n&gt; good. Our scouts have <br/>\n&gt; given us a target. An army of orcs is controlling<br/>\n&gt; the southern path <br/>\n&gt; letting us know that we shall not pass. Our troops<br/>\n&gt; are ready to move <br/>\n&gt; out. I only pray that everyone will return. I look<br/>\n&gt; at the faces of <br/>\n&gt; those with me, those in my group and those beyond.<br/>\n&gt; They are anxious. <br/>\n&gt; They know the risks and yet the shouts and glory of<br/>\n&gt; victory drive <br/>\n&gt; them like a cruel master. They look to me for<br/>\n&gt; comfort and to keep <br/>\n&gt; them going. I hope I do not fail.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We reach the gate, but the enemy is nowhere to be<br/>\n&gt; seen. The stink is <br/>\n&gt; fresh. Do we venture forth or stay behind where it<br/>\n&gt; is safe? Our <br/>\n&gt; orders are clear, we must continue forward. We must<br/>\n&gt; keep them from <br/>\n&gt; penning between our keep and their forces. Group by<br/>\n&gt; group we venture <br/>\n&gt; forward along the path.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A flash of light and some music. I can&#39;t move. The<br/>\n&gt; brutishness of our <br/>\n&gt; foes keeps me rooted in place. All around me I hear<br/>\n&gt; the screams of <br/>\n&gt; agony mixed with their terrible howls of victory.<br/>\n&gt; The orcs have <br/>\n&gt; surrounded us cutting off our escape route. I see my<br/>\n&gt; friends and <br/>\n&gt; fellow fighters going down one by one under the<br/>\n&gt; cruel swords of the <br/>\n&gt; brutish orcs. I am helpless. I see them looking to<br/>\n&gt; for help and it <br/>\n&gt; breaks my heart. How cruel this enemy is, to leave<br/>\n&gt; me with sight and <br/>\n&gt; hearing, yet deprive me of movement.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I feel my hands start to glow. I begin the motions,<br/>\n&gt; healing as I can, <br/>\n&gt; trying to heal those around me that are still<br/>\n&gt; standing. I once again <br/>\n&gt; summon my faith to provide a bunker for those left<br/>\n&gt; as I race to save <br/>\n&gt; those who may yet be living. Frantically, I race<br/>\n&gt; against time to save <br/>\n&gt; one then another hoping I can stay strong. Our<br/>\n&gt; enemies, those that <br/>\n&gt; threaten my homeland, are strong. I am not sure how<br/>\n&gt; much longer I can <br/>\n&gt; hold out. I can feel the energy draining away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Behind me I hear the sound of fresh troops bearing<br/>\n&gt; down on us and I <br/>\n&gt; send a hurried prayer of thanks to Tunare.<br/>\n&gt; Re-enforcements have <br/>\n&gt; arrived. Somewhere inside me, I find the power to<br/>\n&gt; continue healing <br/>\n&gt; and bolstering as much as I can. I watch as our<br/>\n&gt; enemies slowly fall <br/>\n&gt; beneath our forces until there are none left.<br/>\n&gt; Gratefully, I regroup. <br/>\n&gt; Looking around, I see that most of us still live.<br/>\n&gt; Able to return to <br/>\n&gt; our keep victorious.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are celebrations, joyful reunions and tales to<br/>\n&gt; be told. I hang <br/>\n&gt; back. Today we were lucky; tomorrow we will face<br/>\n&gt; death again. How can <br/>\n&gt; we hold out? I don&#39;t know, but I cannot give up the<br/>\n&gt; faith. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is my calling.<br/>\n&gt; My vocation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a cleric.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nThe all-new My Yahoo! - What will yours do?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.yahoo.com\">http://my.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
