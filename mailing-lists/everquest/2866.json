Some <br/>\nvery interesting new stuff since the last patch(s). Killed a <br/>\nwoodlands lion and got five items. The usual skins and meat, plus a <br/>\nmane and a malted lions skin. Never seen a mane before, but the <br/>\nmalted is absolutely new to me. Anyone know what these are for?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis character is Bartoo, cousin of my Halfling Druid Barto. Kind of <br/>\nan rpg justification for the items Barto may give Bartoo now and then.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the noobie asking what to play, I can recommend Halfings in <br/>\ngeneral just because they have so few faction problems. The druid can <br/>\nfight well enough to gain noob experience in Misty and still learn <br/>\ncasting without too much frustration. Warriors are easy because you <br/>\njust have to learn to fight. I use my druid as primary because he can <br/>\nsolo in travel, combat, and can bind anywhere. I don&#39;t have to depend <br/>\non finding a group, a good thing when one logs on for short bouts of <br/>\ngaming and there is no time to find a suitable group.<br/>\n<br/>\nBartoo<br/>\nHalfling Warrior</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
