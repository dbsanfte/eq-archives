I can see losing the exp, but I hate trying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to find my corpse and get all my gear back.

The higher up you go sometimes even greens can kill you if you happen<br/>\nto get unlucky. My main can&#39;t even solo a light blue if he can&#39;t get spells<br/>\noff. Hell, at lvl 52 he got owned by Kizdean Gix in West Commons (well,<br/>\nalmost owned, had to run tot he zone) bc the little fucker resisted all of<br/>\nmy stuns and nukes, broke free of root less than a second after it was cast,<br/>\nand interrupted all my spells even when he missed me. The higher level you<br/>\nget the more you run into mobs that have more HP/AC and abilities than a<br/>\nplayer of the same level. Like lvl 40 enchanter mobs with 3k hp.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
