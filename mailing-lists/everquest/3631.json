I just heard <br/>\nabout it, learned that the spells were in my home of Rivervale, and <br/>\nbought all I could use. Just wondered if this was very new, or if I <br/>\nsimply have had my head up my backside. Hadn&#39;t seen the vendor <br/>\nbefore. In the back of the druid&#39;s guild in Rivervale.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone familiar with the Twilight Sea? Since I can port right there, <br/>\nto the island of the elementals, I was wondering if it would be nuts <br/>\nto try to solo there at lvl 33? Nice drops from those elementals, but <br/>\nI may try to get a group up if the solo thing is not workable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
