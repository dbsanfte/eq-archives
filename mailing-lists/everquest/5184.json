I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; am a graduate student at the Institute of Design at Illinois <br/>\n&gt; Institute of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Technology in Chicago. For one of my classes, entitled Observing <br/>\n&gt; Users, we <br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to study a product and its users. Our group chose Everquest <br/>\n&gt; because we <br/>\n&gt; &gt; think that it is very interesting and complex. As a retired online <br/>\n&gt; gamer I know <br/>\n&gt; &gt; how much fun and involving the games can be. In fact, I am very <br/>\n&gt; tempted to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; jump into Everquest, but I am worried that I may lose <br/>\n&gt; concentration on my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; studies. If anyone is willing to devote a little of their time to <br/>\n&gt; helping us out we <br/>\n&gt; &gt; would really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are poor grad <br/>\n&gt; students and will <br/>\n&gt; &gt; not be able to compensate anyone who helps us out, but we will <br/>\n&gt; very very <br/>\n&gt; &gt; thankful. Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Andrew Haywood </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
