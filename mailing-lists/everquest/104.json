When I don&#39;t have enough<br/>\n&gt; time to play my bigger characters I can always ramble around with my<br/>\n&gt; small test guys who are, slowly growing.<br/>\n&gt; Another point is that they reset server and boot people without<br/>\n&gt; warning usually, and I didn&#39;t pay for this as a permanent effect!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thormael<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Shane Bole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;RE: [EverQuest] Dark Elf Shadow Warrior - Newbie Fodderwheres the<br/>\n&gt; fun in not taking a risk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  From: Whitmore, Lance<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Dark Elf Shadow Warrior - Newbie Fodder<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  This is all very well but i would not advise new players to use<br/>\n&gt; the Test Server simply because Varent has said that characters<br/>\n&gt; created on the test server are not immune from player wipes.  I would<br/>\n&gt; not feel very well if i had worked up my player 10+ lvls and found<br/>\n&gt; that one day, the character was deleted... its great for users to<br/>\n&gt; spend some time there..  heck i have 3 characters on there myself..<br/>\n&gt; I just wouldnt advise a newbie to start there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Vespair<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
