Or maybe<br/>\nnot, lol. Can&#39;t remember right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I do, is create a seperate chat window<br/>\njust for group chat. Right click on the top of your<br/>\nchat window where it says Main chat, click new chat<br/>\nwindow, then rearrange and resize all your windows<br/>\nuntill you get a setup that you can work with and live<br/>\nwith. I try to keep both my chat boxes at the bottom,<br/>\nand made a bit smaller so that they both are<br/>\nside-by-side.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the shaman advice, I myself have never played<br/>\none. But I do know that they are mostly wanted in<br/>\ngroups for their great buffs and their ability to slow<br/>\nthe mob. Also, if you have a cleric in your group,<br/>\nshaman are great back-up healers.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Edward Fox &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:family10@...\">family10@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Folks I need some tips. I grouped for the first time<br/>\n&gt; ever in the <br/>\n&gt; camp in the Northern end of Paludal Caverns. I had<br/>\n&gt; no idea what to <br/>\n&gt; do so I kept everybody healed. My character is a<br/>\n&gt; level 23 shaman. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then I was told that I should be giving everybody<br/>\n&gt; dex buffs instead. <br/>\n&gt; So I did. I told everyone that to tell me when they<br/>\n&gt; needed more <br/>\n&gt; buffing. Then, after a while, I was told about<br/>\n&gt; something called a <br/>\n&gt; gropu channel and that I ought to click &quot;say&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Note that I gathered that while watching text scroll<br/>\n&gt; up and off my <br/>\n&gt; screen faster than I could read it. Everytime that a<br/>\n&gt; mob bealched, I <br/>\n&gt; got a line of text. Things were very lively.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m level 24 now. I figured out that right clicking<br/>\n&gt; the dialog bar <br/>\n&gt; will pull a box that will let me filter out<br/>\n&gt; everything but group <br/>\n&gt; chat using group-say.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How is a shaman important to a group? What does the<br/>\n&gt; group need most <br/>\n&gt; from the shaman? What is a shaman expected to know?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My character is Gunli on the Luclin server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on the eighth day God said, &quot;O.K.
