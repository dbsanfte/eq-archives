I&#39;d like to see people jumping off kelethin on horses.<br/>\n&gt; there is sort of an &quot;feature&quot; (aka bug) in Plane of Sky.<br/>\n&gt; for those of you who don&#39;t know PoS:<br/>\n&gt;  - you need a 46+ whizzy to get there<br/>\n&gt;  - there are many small isles connected by &quot;teleports&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  - you need some loot to get a key after you killed boss of isle<br/>\n&gt;  - to leave PoS you jump of an isle and after you leave the zone<br/>\n&gt;    you will keep on falling into the water in west freeport<br/>\n&gt;  - on leaving the zone, all keys will vanish even if they<br/>\n&gt;    aren&#39;t NO RENT<br/>\n&gt;  - Call of Hero (Summon Player to casting Mage) does not<br/>\n&gt;    work<br/>\n&gt;  - levitate doesn&#39;t work (so no way back to 1st isle)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wow. sounds nasty.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; so people try to keep keys on corpses or leave char logged in PoS.<br/>\n&gt; the problems with corpses: they rot after a week, and you need it<br/>\n&gt; on first isle. but it costs some pp to get necro up there to summon<br/>\n&gt; corpse. and a logged out char can&#39;t just walk/fly back to 1st isle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would never leave my corpse sitting that long...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; on one of my last PoS raids i discovered the following thing: jump<br/>\n&gt; off an isle mounted. when you reach the zoneline, you get the message<br/>\n&gt; that you have fallen beneath the world and are moved to the safespot<br/>\n&gt; in the zone... and this happens to be on 1st isle... ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cool.
