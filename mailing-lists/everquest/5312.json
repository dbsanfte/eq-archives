Then I spent 1500pp on nice \narmor for one of my lower level toons and there went all my money.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"redhawk1974@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:redhawk1974@...\">Rickey</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, December 01, 2003 7:33 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] money</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>hello everyone..
