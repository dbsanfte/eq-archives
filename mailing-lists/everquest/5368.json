I came up with an idea of a meal in a bag I buy a <br/>\nsmall 4 slot bag put a stack of patty melts and a stack of dessert and a <br/>\nstack of wine, milk or water and top it off with a flower.  It is quick and <br/>\neasy and they sell like HOT cakes.  Also as you get higher in baking you can <br/>\nmake things that have a proc value like justice fruit pies that raise your <br/>\nstates and halas meat pies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose that have 100kpp pay for it on site they buy their money I think that <br/>\nis cheating and I won&#39;t waste that kind of money just to buy an over priced <br/>\nweapon or pievce of armor<br/>\n<br/>\nRougejenna &lt;therris-thule server&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Su &lt;suceress@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EverQuest] money<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sun, 14 Dec 2003 06:17:53 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hello everyone.. I am new to this club but not EQ..  Lets talk about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; makeing money.. I know to kill giants and farm silks and hides to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make money and you make god money doing this.. But how the heck do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people make 100k and more lol.. most i have had at one time is 5k..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If there is a better way to make pp  please let me know  thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Basically farming and doing lost dungeon adventures is pretty profitable. I<br/>\n&gt;myself am not good at making money yet. I need to work on it. I&#39;m hoping to<br/>\n&gt;be able to profit from my jewelcraft when I get it high enough. I had to <br/>\n&gt;get<br/>\n&gt;it high to work on my 7th shawl. If you have a foraging class, you can make<br/>\n&gt;coin foraging stuff to sell.<br/>\n&gt;Anyone know of good websites that have money making advice (not the pay<br/>\n&gt;sites)?<br/>\n&gt;luv,<br/>\n&gt;-Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---<br/>\n&gt;Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt;Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt;Version: 6.0.544 / Virus Database: 338 - Release Date: 11/25/2003<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of slow downloads and busy signals?
