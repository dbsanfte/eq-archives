My mom was sooo happy when I taught her how to make sow<br/>\npotions with her shammie. :-)<br/>\nNot to mention Bear form is adorable.<br/>\nIf you play a shaman expect to have bossy tanks demanding &quot;haste now!&quot;<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  FINALLY someone Mentioned the shaman. =D I started playing EQ in January.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I now have a level 40 Vah Shir shaman that rocks. I have damage over time<br/>\nspells that can do around 2000 pts in damage in just under 2 minutes,  Plus<br/>\na pet who can do the rest of the damage while the dot&#39;s are doing their<br/>\nwork.  Like Orion said,  I have SOW, plus buffs that enhance all melee<br/>\nstats.  With the click of a button, I can give my whole group SOW with an<br/>\nattack bonus on it. I also have a spell that does the same with Strength.  I<br/>\ncan increase your Agility, Dex, Stamina all by 30.  by the time I get to 60<br/>\nI will have a spell that increases those stats by 120 AND your attack by<br/>\n120.  I have buffs that increase your HP and AC although they are not as<br/>\npowerful as a clerics, combined with the stat buffs they more than make up.<br/>\nI also have stat debuffing spells that can slow a mob,  decrease strength,<br/>\nand decrease their resists so that a wizard or any other spellcasting class<br/>\ncan nuke the mob.  There are also a few nukes a shaman can get although not<br/>\nas powerful as a wizard.  We can also act as back up healers if the cleric<br/>\nis OOM or getting hit.  Overall,  I think that the shaman is one of the best<br/>\nbalanced classes and a great class to start with.   Although the mid range<br/>\narmor (totemic) IS a might difficult to get =D  (finally just got my totemic<br/>\nBP)  I would suggest starting either a vah shir,  or barbarian as they can<br/>\ngo more places without being killed everywhere they go.  As a vah shir,  I<br/>\nam KOS to very few places =D  Sorry about the soapbox,  but I love my<br/>\nShaman.  I also forgot to add that at 25 (you&#39;re better off starting at 30)<br/>\nyou get alchemy..  you can make potions that you can sell to other players<br/>\nlike SOW, & invis vs undead which can be quite handy...  Oh,  Shamans also<br/>\nhave the ability to gate.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Katashaka Naboombu<br/>\n </span></blockquote>40 Shaman and future grandmaster alchemist<br/>\nVazaelle  Proud Member of Champions of War<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Orion &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:orionv@...\">orionv@...</a>&gt; wrote: I think everyone is forgetting a really<br/>\n </span></blockquote>great one.
