All other stats <br/>\ncan take a flying leap backwards if it means sacrificing either of <br/>\nthese all important stats.  But if you wish to look for gear with <br/>\na &quot;tanking&quot; SK in mind, look for AGI, STA, STR, DEX items in that <br/>\norder.  Here&#39;s why<br/>\n&gt; Agility = Raises Armor class and the ability to dodge incoming <br/>\nattacks all together.  30 AGI may allow you to avoid a 90hp attack <br/>\nall together so this helps emensely.<br/>\n&gt; Stamina = Increases hitpoints and the ability to mitigate damage.  <br/>\nIt won&#39;t do either well until higher levels but 4hp for every 1 sta <br/>\ndoes add up and getting hit for 89hp instead of 92 does add up after <br/>\na while.<br/>\n&gt; Strength = Raises attack power and the cap to hit.  instead of <br/>\nhitting for 54, a higher strength will allow you to hit for 57. its <br/>\nnot much but every little bit counts.<br/>\n&gt; Dexterity = At low levels, increasing this stat means you will <br/>\nlearn Weapon skills faster (2HB, 1HS etc) so getting some gear that <br/>\nhas some high Dex wouldn&#39;t hurt in the least.  This skill should be <br/>\nthe least of your worries but that doesn&#39;t mean ignore it<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; As for Weapons,<br/>\n&gt; Let me first stress to you the UBER importance of practicing on all <br/>\nof your weapon skills.  <br/>\n&gt; 1HS, 1HB, 2HS, 2HB and Piercing<br/>\n&gt; There are good weapons for each of these types for SK&#39;s so it would <br/>\nbe a shame if you won the Plane of Time SK 1HB weapon only to find <br/>\nyou have 13 skill in it.  Since you&#39;re still at a low level (which is <br/>\na good thing btw), you can still correct any mistakes you&#39;ve made in <br/>\ngear/weapons/quests/faction.  If you are still in your high teens and <br/>\nlow/mid 20&#39;s in terms of levels, look for weapons in the bazaar that <br/>\nhave mediocre damage but high delay.  I&#39;ll explain why.  Getting a 50 <br/>\ndamage 40 delay weapon is going to do crap for you since you&#39;re <br/>\nweapons cap in damage output until you reach certain levels.  Did you <br/>\nnotice that the sporiali defender suddenly hit(s) harder at level 20 <br/>\nthan it did at level 18 and 19?  Thats because you &quot;dinged&quot; into your <br/>\nnew level cap which I believe is around 100-110hp.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; If you are confused, just look at it this way.  Look for all types <br/>\nof weapons with VERY fast delay (between 20-30) and damage of no more <br/>\nthan about 25-35.  These weapons are only temporary as once <br/>\nyou &quot;ding&quot; into your next damage cap at around level 28 or so, you&#39;ll <br/>\nwant to upgrade your weapons again to slightly higher damage output.  <br/>\nWhats the point of having a 50 damage weapon if the damage cap makes <br/>\nit only a 25 damage weapon.  Makes sense?<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;ll have 5 or so Damage caps (lvl 10, 20, 28, 35ish, and 45) <br/>\nuntil you reach level 51 when you&#39;re damage cap is removed and you <br/>\ncan hit for full damage.  This is far down the road but something to <br/>\nlook forward too.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; BTW, if you can afford it, there is a very nice 1HS sword that <br/>\ndrops in Walls of Slaughter that if you can afford it (12K on my <br/>\nserver last I checked back in August), it would serve you VERY well <br/>\neven at lower levels.  The damage/delay ratios even when level capped <br/>\nmake it a surprizingly excellent weapon at all levels of play.  <br/>\nSorry, don&#39;t know the name of it off hand.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Good luck to you Lisa, <br/>\n&gt; SK&#39;s are a fun class to be.  I LOVED my Iksar SK until I recently <br/>\nretired.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lisa &lt;lisab38@h...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thu, 10 Nov 2005 18:52:35 -0000<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] Re: SK Help ????<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;STG2(SW) Pierce&quot; &lt;piercer@d...&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the info :)  Will look into that--My SK is only Level 17 <br/>\n&gt; atm so not even sure if she has the &quot;casting darkness&quot; spell yet.  <br/>\n&gt; Right now I have &quot;clinging darkness&quot; but alot of the higher level <br/>\n&gt; mobs are resisting my spells and its really frustrating.  <br/>\n&gt; The weapon we have now is a Sporielli Defenders Blade???  it does <br/>\n28 <br/>\n&gt; damage with +5 DEX but that is all---so I should go with a better <br/>\n&gt; stat weapon?? with more HP/AC  ???  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks !!!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
