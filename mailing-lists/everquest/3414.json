Yeah, there have been some people constantly bitching in<br/>\nEC about how EC is dead and blah blah blah. Carrying on about why people<br/>\naren&#39;t selling there anymore and stuff. I personally like having less people<br/>\nthere spamming for sales. Made it easier to sell my Ring of the Frost<br/>\nSpiders (btw, I found that actually advertising the stats of the item got<br/>\ninstant attention-- one guy was trying to sell the same item but not saying<br/>\nthe stats. I advertised it just to show the stats for him and immediately<br/>\ngot tells from people who wanted it).<br/>\nI wonder what Planes of Power is going to do in terms of clearing out the<br/>\nzones..<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t think anyone on here has lashed out at Verant but I know several<br/>\n&gt; have during game play, that comment was mostly meant for them.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a new thing so yea people are going to flock to it. I personally<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t been there yet. I was told you need the Luclin expansion for it.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t have that one, heck I just picked up the Ruins expan yesterday!<br/>\n&gt; Lol!<br/>\n&gt; I have to admit I personally am enjoying the little amount of people in<br/>\n&gt; the game, I&#39;m getting a hold of a lot of great stuff and making some<br/>\n&gt; decent plat amounts. I&#39;ve been able to get all the items I need for my<br/>\n&gt; quests and so forth. Today I was surprised and happy to see a few people<br/>\n&gt; running around in Steamfront.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway back to my quests!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
