I do agree \n  very much that you shall keep your account safe and all<br>this, but in a \n  large scale operations guild its IMPOSSIBLE to not share your<br>account with \n  a few people that you trust. This is essential to day to day<br>operations. \n  You choose a couple of people who you trust and hand them \n  your<br>info.<br><br>1 example. Guild property and funding. A single person \n  cannot manage the<br>trades/funds/hand out of items for the guild. This would \n  be a full time job<br>for 1 person in my guild. Our solution is a separate \n  account shared among<br>the officers with mules for cash / gems / spells / \n  items. On our<br>messageboard transactions take place and a member can ask any \n  officer to<br>complete a transaction once its validated on board. This is \n  clearly against<br>the EULA but since there are no support for these types of \n  operations with a<br>central store for a guild we have not found a better way \n  to handle work like<br>this. How do others solve these types of \n  problems?<br><br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: Su \n  [mailto:suceress@...]<br>Sent: Friday, July 19, 2002 5:32 PM<br>To: \n  EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br>Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Digest Number \n  531<br><br><br>Well, any exchange of accounts is forbidden by the terms of \n  service.
