I enjoy being an Enchantress because I am looking <br/>\nforward to some of the cool spells that I will eventually get (Charm, <br/>\nKEI, etc.) I just made Level 10 and am scared to death now because <br/>\nI&#39;m afraid of getting killed, not being able to get back to my <br/>\ncorpse, and losing all my stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI joined a website that lists quests and the levels you can complete <br/>\nthe quests at, the site says you can complete the Stein of Moggok <br/>\nquest at level 8. I have components to make a Stein of Moggok, have <br/>\nthe book to get another Stein, but when I try to give bartender Clurg <br/>\nthe book, his body guard knocks me on my butt. And I can&#39;t use the <br/>\nDark Elf Ill. spell until level 12, so why does everyone say that you <br/>\ncan finish the quest at 8?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any other quests that low-level Enchantress&#39;s can do to get <br/>\nnice equipment, money and experience?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help a lady out? Thanks much.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
