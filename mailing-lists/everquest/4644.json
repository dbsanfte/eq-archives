I used to be able to teach a language to my group and get better at it.  This is no longer so, and I talked to a GM who told me this was never so.  I was also told that something changed in respect to languages and zoning or something.  I am quite curious about this, as I am trying to learn every language I can.  I was also curious if you could teach over your own knowledge in the language.  Thank you in advance for your replies.\r<br/>\nAdimisha Elvintide\r<br/>\nRodcet Nife server<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Paid...
