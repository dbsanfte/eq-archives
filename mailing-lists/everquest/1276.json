Someone a<br/>\nlong<br/>\nwhile back showed this to me.  Basically you roll from 1 to 30.  The person<br/>\nclosest<br/>\nto 21 without going over wins.   This seems to even out those who<br/>\nconsistantly average<br/>\nlow rolls in the 1-100 randoms.  In over 2 years of playing and using the<br/>\nrandom 1-100<br/>\ni&#39;ve never won or came close to an upper limit.   With blackjack random or<br/>\neven a<br/>\nraondom 1-100 and the closest to 50 is the winner, seems to average things<br/>\nout.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The problem with this is that most people (especially those that seemingly<br/>\nroll high)<br/>\nlove the 1-100 random.  When I suggest the mid range win or blackjack roll,<br/>\nthe first <br/>\ntime they lose to it, they want to go back to the 1-100 again.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  What do you all use as a random or what &#39;rules&#39; do you use for<br/>\ndistributing the good<br/>\nloot or when using Random?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCiao,<br/>\n<br/>\n -Knight   - I still like BlackJack rolls.  I can&#39;re remember the guys name<br/>\nthat first<br/>\n            showed it to me though.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
