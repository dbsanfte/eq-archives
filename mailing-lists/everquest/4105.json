I posted this over on the forum at Sorcerors.Net <br/>\noriginally and have decided to post this here<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way to play the game w/o going online? Probably not, I&#39;d <br/>\nsay. But I&#39;ve seen some gamecards being sold at EB etc which allows <br/>\nppl to play w/o credit cards so I&#39;m tempted to install it. But some <br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1- What are the Rangers like?<br/>\n2- Can thieves backstab? If so, do they fade out like in the <br/>\nInfinity Engine D&D games? would the enemy player (being attacked) <br/>\nbe able to dodge?<br/>\n3- What are some of other classes like?<br/>\n4- Is it REALLY that addictive?<br/>\n<br/>\nGabriel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
