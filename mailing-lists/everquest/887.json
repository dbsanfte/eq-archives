She&#39;s decided to start<br/>\nan Ogre warrioress with green hair (She liked the green hair for some reason),<br/>\nand I brought her all the way to freeport.  <br/>\n <br/>\n  Since i&#39;ve never played an evil factioned race before, i have no idea where<br/>\nshe should go to train her skills.  We found she can get into Neriak to buy/sell<br/>\nand bank, but the warriors guild there won&#39;t train her.  We also tried that   <br/>\nbarbarian warrior under east freeport.  <br/>\n <br/>\n  Does any know where she can train near Neriak or freeport? Or does she have<br/>\nto travel all the way back to Ogguk?  Also any tips on what she can do to help<br/>\nher faction so she can get into the freeport city would be appreciated! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n -Sceadu<br/>\n  Lvl 6 (Human) Shadow Knight<br/>\n  Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
