Fear Kiting works wonders.  Necros can also use a similar <br/>\ntact by fearing and the sending their pet in after the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile EW can be soloed, you have to be very careful of dervishes and <br/>\ngiants.  First off, even at level 55+ dervishes will be much lower <br/>\nin level but can still hurt you plenty.  The hit hard, and can <br/>\nquikcly gang up if there is more than one in the area.  The second <br/>\ndanger is the giants that roam.  While these guys are easily <br/>\nquelmed, they also hit hard and can gang up.  If you are fighting <br/>\none of these and a dervish or two join in... well you better be a <br/>\ntank with massive HP, be a necro with a pet, or have an extra pair <br/>\nof shoes in the bank because you are going to be on a CR soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, EW has one additional danger that many people do not think <br/>\nabout.  If you are fighting near the Kael ramp you don&#39;t want to <br/>\nlinger.  Hanging around the Kael ramp too long spawns the Death <br/>\nSquad and these things will tear through anything that is not on <br/>\ntheir faction.  Just a heads up.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrago<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think if you fight in EW it&#39;s best to say near the bridge to IC <br/>\nand to be<br/>\n&gt; careful. there can be lots of adds. One good method I saw a druid <br/>\nusing was<br/>\n&gt; to snare a mob then cast camo on herself and run back to the <br/>\nbridge. That<br/>\n&gt; way other mobs didn&#39;t see her running.<br/>\n&gt; Also, if you can use the spell to charm an animal you can charm a <br/>\nwolf or<br/>\n&gt; kitty to help you. Only problem is when charm wears off. If things <br/>\ngo bad<br/>\n&gt; you can run accross the bridge to zone.<br/>\n&gt; I believe I hunted in DL at that lvl, but I&#39;m a cleric so I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t solo.<br/>\n&gt; If you have Lost Dungeons of Norrath it&#39;s really great xp. I know <br/>\nyou can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; solo, but the xp in group is worth it.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; my friend says that other ppl told her to solo in eastern <br/>\nwastes......<br/>\n&gt; shes the same lvl and a dru!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -lori<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Masteradept &lt;masteradept007@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ok I&#39;m asking the question....I&#39;m a 46 druid...and I&#39;m wondering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where you guys would solo at this point.
