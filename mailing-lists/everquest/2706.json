When I started out I was so excited<br/>\nwhen I discovered eqtraders for the sewing recipes.  I wore my homemade<br/>\nleather armor for a long time.  I didn&#39;t really get any help when I started<br/>\nout except maybe some buffs from people helping out as I was training all<br/>\nthe spiders to the guards in GFay.   Anybody can make money in the game if<br/>\nthey&#39;d just shut up and start killing and looting the mobs.  I made alot of<br/>\nmoney just looting corpses I found (a little twinge of guilt there until I<br/>\nfound out they had 2 full minutes to loot before it was available to me)<br/>\nI&#39;ve never begged for money from other players<br/>\nAs I got higher, I&#39;ve had people begging from me.  I laugh at them most of<br/>\nthe time.  I never have money to spare.  I have offered advice and walkthrus<br/>\non quests tho, especially in Shar Vahl, those poor noob cats are totally<br/>\nlost trying to figure out the town and where the NPCs are for citizen<br/>\nquests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess maybe I was a litte harsh to that newbie chanter, yes, but I have<br/>\n  used my Druid&#39;s bank account to equip numerous new druids and rangers in<br/>\n  that zone with full leather armor, a half-way decent newbie weapon, and a<br/>\n  little buffing (skin like diamond, sow, strength of stone, thorns, regen),<br/>\n  but not because they begged. I did it because they seemed to be players<br/>\nthat<br/>\n  wanted to have fun and to play the game right, but needed a little boost,<br/>\n  and I enjoy helping people. I don&#39;t enjoy beggars, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyone else have thoughts to share on players who spam the newbie zones<br/>\n  asking to be given free money or items? I would be interested to see how<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  others on this mailing list feel about the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n  =)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Froondor, 41 Wood Elf Druid on Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
