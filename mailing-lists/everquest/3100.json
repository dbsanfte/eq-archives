I guess a lot of <br/>\npeople don&#39;t take them very seriously and so they turn out badly.  <br/>\nBut then, some don&#39;t.  We&#39;re one of those &quot;nice&quot; stories.  It <br/>\nactually all started pre-EQ on The Realm.  We met, fell in love, and <br/>\nwere married on The Realm in their chapel along with loads of <br/>\nfriends.  We have now been together for over 4 years and are married <br/>\nin real life and playing EQ together on our computers. <br/>\n<br/>\nGamewise, there really aren&#39;t any implications other than a general <br/>\nnotice of the marriage.  It doesn&#39;t actually affect game play at <br/>\nall.  And so, in real life, it isn&#39;t any commitment unless you chose <br/>\nto make it one.  It&#39;s just that too many people take the idea of an <br/>\nin-game marriage too lightly and others too seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo think twice before asking or accepting a marriage proposal.  <br/>\nRemember that avatar you&#39;re looking at has a real person behind it <br/>\nwho has real feelings, cares, and concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\n~J~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
