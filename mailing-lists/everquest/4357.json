Unfortunately the mage that was<br/>\nsupposed to come was a no-show. So the raid had to be cancelled as we didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave enough people to fight their way in.<br/>\nI then realized that I don&#39;t even know any high level mages who are not kos<br/>\nin chardok (and who have the ability to summon people to them).<br/>\nIf you know anyone who has such a character or are such a person, please<br/>\nplease please let me know. I will give free rezzes with my click stick once<br/>\nI get it.<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su aka Conwyn 54 cleric<br/>\nThe Tribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
