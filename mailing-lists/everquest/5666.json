I had manage to wait until the webpage fully loaded.. <br/>\nit shows a skull.gif and those 2 eq files are shown too..<br/>\n<br/>\n..but after trying several times (20x) to download those two files <br/>\nwith and without using download express/accelerator.. somehow they <br/>\nwould only reach 200k and stop.. any solution to that? Thanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\n(my isp somehow has a funny firewall that limit ur traffic to 1 <br/>\nline, so when downloading those patch using default eq program.. I <br/>\ncan only wait while waiting for one particular file (for instance <br/>\neqgame.exe) to finish and if it took too long then sometime, after <br/>\n1mb my isp will disconnect.. but if I start up a website to boost <br/>\nthe speed, or ping the isp/patch.everquest.com to keep the <br/>\nconnection alive.. then the file that has been patching for awhile <br/>\nwill stop as it thinks I am doing something else.. sigh, so I either <br/>\nhad to finish d/l a 1mb file in 30min or I shall never have it <br/>\n(using d/l express I can get 10mb in an hour, without using it.. <br/>\nusually 1mb took 20min) *I shudders at the thought of pactching <br/>\nnedaria.s3d that is 4mb big*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
