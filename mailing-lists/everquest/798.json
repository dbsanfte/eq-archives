Is &#39;inspect&#39; a totally<br/>\naccepted thing, or is there some sort of<br/>\nettiquette that goes along with it? I don&#39;t mind<br/>\nso much if I&#39;ve been chatting with someone for a<br/>\nlittle while and they take a peek [it&#39;s not like<br/>\nI have anything good to hide!] but when people<br/>\ncome right up to you, snoop, and then don&#39;t even<br/>\nrespond when you say &#39;Hail&#39; , I find that<br/>\nextremely annoying.
