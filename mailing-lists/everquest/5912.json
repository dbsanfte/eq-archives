Minor Muramite runes, Lesser Muramite Runes, and Greater Muramite Runes. Minor runes are for levels 66-67, lesser are for 67-68,\n and greater are for 69-70. There is an NPC in Draniks Scar you turn the runes into in order to get the spells. The name escapes me but it&#39;s an Iksar NPC off to the west of the POD zone in in Dranik&#39;s.
