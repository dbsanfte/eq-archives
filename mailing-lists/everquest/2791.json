So, the 4mx was the best next choice. I will <br/>\njust bear with the minor hiccups until I am ready to go for a new <br/>\nsystem. It is really much better than before. Especially after the <br/>\ntnt2 crapped out and I was stuck with my onboard graphics for a few <br/>\nweeks. The present is really quite good, comparatively.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I would have gone for a more robust <br/>\nsystem in spite of financial constraints, but the one I bought seemed <br/>\nto be a sound mid-level machine at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow good does a system have to be to survive for any time in the ever <br/>\nadvancing world of EQ? Better than I thought last year, that is for <br/>\nsure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is the hope that S&V will continue to patch with retro-<br/>\ncompatibility in mind. I know that they won&#39;t make that a primary <br/>\npurpose, but the market might not bear a constant demand for users to <br/>\nupgrade. They appear to know and respond to the market, and should <br/>\nhave some idea just how much the gaming public will pay to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Louis Gumaer&quot; &lt;lgumaer@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Get more Ram.

Got it installed and went for a test drive.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   One area that is a big problem is Rivervale. With the last <br/>\nexpansion <br/>\n&gt;   Rivervale became so laggy that I avoided going home when I could. <br/>\nNow <br/>\n&gt;   I get a few hiccups when I enter the zone, then it settles down <br/>\nto a <br/>\n&gt;   playable level. A hitch now and then, but nothing like before the <br/>\n&gt;   upgrade.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Checked out a few cities, some zones in between. Made technical <br/>\n&gt;   adjustments. On the whole quite pleased.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   One thing I noticed was a bit of lag in laggy zones (Luclin was <br/>\n&gt;   almost unplayable until now)until I had been there a bit. When I <br/>\nwent <br/>\n&gt;   to the Bazaar I just did a slow 360 and the lag went away. Figure <br/>\n&gt;   enough of the zone loaded into active memory to carry the play <br/>\nfrom <br/>\n&gt;   then on. Perhaps someone could explain what was actuall happening <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt;   the system when I do this. Anyway, I do a scan of my environment <br/>\nwhen <br/>\n&gt;   I zone and things are pretty smooth.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   This is my last upgrade to my present system. Have to replace my <br/>\n&gt;   tower next, and hope to hold out a while. How much can I spend <br/>\nevery <br/>\n&gt;   year on these things? The family expects me to feed them, and I <br/>\nhate <br/>\n&gt;   to dissppoint them too often on that account just to play my game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Now if DSL comes down a bit in price, I may try that. Could that <br/>\nbe <br/>\n&gt;   the key to absolute smooth-as-butter-on-a-bald-monkey performance <br/>\non <br/>\n&gt;   my aging machine? (The thing is just a bit over a year old. How <br/>\nfast <br/>\n&gt;   they grow old.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
