One in particular looked good for my druid. <br/>\nA nice drop in Luclin. I investigated the journey and the target <br/>\ncreature, and it looked quite do-able for my character. However, I <br/>\nwas confused by the review on AllaKhazam stating that the recommended <br/>\nlevel to attain was 50. I am lvl 30, and the npc doing the drop is 25-<br/>\n25. The journey, though long, is not particularly difficult, at least <br/>\nfrom what the maps and bestiary information indicate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing something about these recommended levels on the <br/>\nAllaKhazam reviews?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
