I get so tired<br/>\nof wandering around, hoping to trip over that dwarf,<br/>\nlol.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnow griffin eggs are the last part of the 3rd shawl.<br/>\nAlso boring, but at least you&#39;re killing stuff. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Su &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve had people tell me there are better items out<br/>\n&gt; there with less effort,<br/>\n&gt; but it feels good to accomplish something like this.<br/>\n&gt; :-)<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d heard they originally planned to have more than<br/>\n&gt; 8 shawls but I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; heard of any quests to get more shawls after the<br/>\n&gt; 8th. I think I read that<br/>\n&gt; they planned to do 11 shawl quests or something. I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; be happy with 8 or 10.<br/>\n&gt; I like even numbers. :-D But I hope they don&#39;t make<br/>\n&gt; the skill needed to do<br/>\n&gt; the shawl so ungodly high. I wish there were more<br/>\n&gt; quests for tradeskills<br/>\n&gt; that were doable at 101 to 120 range in skill.<br/>\n&gt; The 4th.. is that the one with the triggers that<br/>\n&gt; might spawn the deathsquad?<br/>\n&gt; or is that the one that needs snow griffin eggs?<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Congrats! I&#39;ve never been able to get past the 4th<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shawl on two of my toons...
