[Verant] could have programmed the game with more logging ???(see ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2002471763\">My turn to rant (and I know this is going to piss some people off, but I<br/>\ngotta say it)<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  &quot;[Verant] could have programmed the game with more logging&quot;???(see<br/>\nbelow)  Please.  I&#39;m going to have to come to Verants defense now.  Any<br/>\nidea how much more lag there would be if there was more logging with 50<br/>\n- 100 in a zone?  Verant used a nice median between logs so as to not<br/>\nbog the game down more.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Everyone is complaining that there character traits and skills are<br/>\nunfair.  Boo hoo.  REAL LIFE is not fair.  And Verant is trying to make<br/>\nthe game as real as possible. (Muffin anyone?) If your Race or Class is<br/>\nthat bad that you feel you need to complain everyday then change.  Hey!<br/>\nNo one&#39;s complaining about being a ranger or paladin, so lets all be<br/>\nrangers and paladins.  Even the damn wizards who are kill stealers are<br/>\ncomplaining for some reason that their class is unfair (Note today&#39;s<br/>\nEQ&#39;Lizer).  Playing a unfair character or hard character is sweet,<br/>\nbecause when you succeed, you prove your own abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Boo hoo.  Make Poison and Apply Poison doesn&#39;t work yet and I can&#39;t<br/>\nsneak up behind a creature undetected and backstab for 100 points<br/>\neverytime.  Wow, rogues really have it rough.  They&#39;ve only said a<br/>\nmillion times that they are working on these problems, so chill out and<br/>\nenjoy what your rogue can do.  And if he (she) still can&#39;t do anything,<br/>\nthen that probably reflects your intelligence more that your character&#39;s<br/>\nabilities.  (And as a side note, I did like the Rogue Protest on Solusek<br/>\nRo.)<br/>\n<br/>\n4. My human warrior sucks at level 20.  Wow Einstein.  Did you ever<br/>\nwonder why the first 15 levels were so easy?  This class was designed<br/>\nfor Buffoons with attention deficit syndrome.  You were supposed to be<br/>\nbored of this guy after 5 levels.  Try playing a hard character.<br/>\nThey&#39;re the ones that pay off in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Where are the new zones and other planes?  The game was not designed<br/>\nfor people playing 24-7.  The creators themselves said this.  Try<br/>\ngetting some sunlight.  They&#39;ll come soon enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general to all the people complaining, do you have any idea how much<br/>\ncode has gone into this game?  I find that the few bugs that do exist<br/>\nwith over 20,000 people playing at any given time is quite remarkable.<br/>\nAnd Verant continues to improve the game!  If anyone knows of a better<br/>\noverall game, then why are you playing Everquest?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not saying Verant is perfect, but my only issue with Verant is I&#39;d<br/>\nlike a better status of what they are working on and their proposed<br/>\ndeadlines.<br/>\n<br/>\nKudos to Verant.  I&#39;ve wasted my summer away so far on Everquest, but<br/>\nI&#39;m loving every minute!<br/>\n<br/>\nBaelstorm<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tBrad Schuetz [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dorchalann@...\">dorchalann@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, July 08, 1999 2:51 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EverQuest] Cope...(was Re: Raw deal - need help!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Brad Schuetz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dorchalann@...\">dorchalann@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; See, that&#39;s really the problem.  Verant &quot;Doesn&#39;t know&quot; if you are<br/>\n&gt; lying or<br/>\n&gt; at least that&#39;s what they claim.  I really want to know why there is a<br/>\n&gt; message every few minutes on my screen telling me that my character is<br/>\n&gt; saved<br/>\n&gt; if they refuse to use that info to help players who have been<br/>\n&gt; destroyed by<br/>\n&gt; bugs that should have been squashed in beta.  I&#39;ve been lucky and have<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; lost items due to bugs, it&#39;s happened to a good friend of mine, he<br/>\n&gt; just gave<br/>\n&gt; up that character, didn&#39;t want to deal with that crap.  Verant doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; seem<br/>\n&gt; to understand that we pay money to play this game and we shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;just deal&quot; with these kind of programming mistakes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They could have programmed the game with more logging to know what<br/>\n&gt; happened<br/>\n&gt; when a character dies and know what they had when they died so they<br/>\n&gt; could be<br/>\n&gt; restored without worry that you really traded your items to a friend<br/>\n&gt; before<br/>\n&gt; dieing on the boat but they made the decision not to, apparently, or<br/>\n&gt; to not<br/>\n&gt; use that data and instead they just have their GM&#39;s give the same line<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; garbage every time that they can&#39;t do anything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the biggest problems with this game right now is their severe<br/>\n&gt; lack of<br/>\n&gt; customer service and their lack of being responsible for the bugs in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; game.  BAH<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dorchalann Kilgore<br/>\n&gt; Shaman of Karana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jannus Malus [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jannus_@...\">jannus_@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 08, 1999 10:00 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] Cope...(was Re: Raw deal - need help!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Jannus Malus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jannus_@...\">jannus_@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not to be rough about it, but frankly you&#39;re shit out of luck.
