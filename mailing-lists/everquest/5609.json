Just got back in a couple days ago. My<br/>\nHalfling Druid lvl 42 returned to Rivervale, and I got this whispered<br/>\nmessage to meet a NPC. I had seen the message before, but since I had<br/>\nnothing else going on, I responded. As a result I went searching for a<br/>\ncamp of adventurers. I talked to whom I had been directed to, and was<br/>\nencouraged to go on missions for them. However, I haven&#39;t found anyone<br/>\nin the camp in Butcherblock nor the camp in East Commonlands who will<br/>\ngive me a mission. Anyone know about this Adventure business, or some<br/>\nplace I can look?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, it was sure interesting spending the night in East Commonlands. It<br/>\nused to be lowbee heaven, but I found myself actually fighting for my<br/>\nlife and wondering if I might actually have to run. It was rather fun.<br/>\nA positive change.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n42nd season Halfling Druid.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
