Once I have<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; 5 or more I wait til they are all close to me and cast Word of Pain. Then<br/>\n&gt; They all die instantly. So then I gather up their pelts. some of which can<br/>\n&gt; be turned in for quests.<br/>\n&gt; I do something similar with my wizard and orc pawns in Freeport. I use a<br/>\n&gt; low<br/>\n&gt; lvl dd spell to lure pawns to me and get a whole bunch around me. This is<br/>\n&gt; good when I am encumbered and cannot chase after them. Once I get them<br/>\n&gt; gathered around I use an AE spell. if they don&#39;t all die, I stand in place<br/>\n&gt; and attack the ones that are close to me. If they run I turn to another<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; and fight it. Eventulaly they all come back to me. I keep fighting til<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; are all laying dead around me. then I loot their corpses and gate back to<br/>\n&gt; Hallard&#39;s to deliver pawn picks.<br/>\n&gt; Got my faction up to apprehensive so far.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
