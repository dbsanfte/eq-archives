I got stuck in a group<br/>\nwhere I made no money at all for several hours bc they had split off and the<br/>\ntanks were ninja-looters. Since I was busy healing and medding I got<br/>\nnothing. But I needed xp and faction... So, you can expect to get loot if<br/>\nyou are in a good group. Just establish loot order first. If you want money<br/>\nrather than xp you better be ready to move along to different places to look<br/>\nfor coin if you get stuck with a bad group.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Generally speaking, you don&#39;t get as much money when you solo.  You<br/>\n&gt; get a lot more money when you group.  Sure, you probably don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; everything for yourself but because the groups can pull fast and<br/>\n&gt; kill &#39;em, you generally get more money that way even if you are doing<br/>\n&gt; alpha looting.  If you can get into a group, you probably can make<br/>\n&gt; money that way.  Try the aviaks group in SK.  You can probably do it<br/>\n&gt; at 19.  And yeah, Lena&#39;s correct, if you can get a few more levels<br/>\n&gt; you can group in paw or whatever cuz they drop a lot of FS weapons.<br/>\n&gt; Though, killing gnolls can get really boring after a while.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., Denis Baldwin &lt;dbaldwin@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a 19 Warrior and I need more plat.
