I had a level 18 mage and my<br/>\nfriend was level 20 druid.  I can solo yellow Crag<br/>\nSpiders in EK and his druid has trouble.  The water<br/>\npet is better against poisons and the pets can take<br/>\nthe beating while I cast DD&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO I think this is what you are experiencing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n--- mlockridge01 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have been camping the brutes in Warsliks Woods.<br/>\n&gt; Only once have I <br/>\n&gt; had to wait for the camp.
