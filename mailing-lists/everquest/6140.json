D&#39;oh!!!<br/>\nAnyways, I was angry and I still haven&#39;t gotten ahold of them. When I logged on a different account and said something to the GM they just said &quot;contact tech support&quot;. Tech support was closed at the time. UGH.<br/>\nSo I&#39;m still trying to decide whether or not to renew... Gonna have to wait til they open today to contact them.<br/>\nHow many people has this happened to? Did they delete your characters? If they deleted anything on mine I&#39;m cancelling all of my accounts bc it&#39;s just not worth it to do all that work again. UGH.<br/>\nMust.. wait..  I must calm down and be rational first. It just pisses me off, yaknow?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-04-25, 05:55:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;well i think you sould do it even though it not going to do you any good for they done the same thing to me to so good luck and hope they get you yor account taken care of they sure did not mine so i had to get a new account and start over to i had a lv 68 toon and now i got a lv 50 again and im waiting for then to do it again if they do i am not playing any more the can kiss my a-s if you knoe Marinemouth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Su &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt; wrote:I may be through with EQ now. I went to login to check my email and apparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea why. Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with my brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not I want to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a higher price. I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me off that they pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an angry letter of complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>\n&gt;ARG.
