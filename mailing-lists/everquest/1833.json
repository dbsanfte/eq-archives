You may be able to get them to <br/>\ncough up some of the goods, since selling them locally will be tough <br/>\nas they are ruining their faction with the Citizens of Kaladim. <br/>\nBegging never hurt either.<br/>\n<br/>\nDagdason Level 35 Rogue - Drinal<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;MDMcMahon&quot; &lt;mdmcmahon@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Rico,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Welcome to EQ. =) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Firstly, way to go on choosing a cleric! hehe I&#39;m biased as I play <br/>\na level 50 High Elf Cleric on Xegony. Clerics are a lot of fun imo. <br/>\nAs a new cleric I agree with some of the statements made below. Being <br/>\nBRAND new, just solo around your starting point and loot everything. <br/>\nSell that stuff and save all the money. You will need it for spells <br/>\nobviously and you&#39;ll also want to pick up some better armor than the <br/>\ntunic your guild gives you. I wore leather armor for a very long time <br/>\nuntil I had saved enough to buy something else. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When you do get higher in level and can start buying some better <br/>\nitems, work on buying stuff that is +wis. This will help a lot. <br/>\nFarther down the road at much higher levels you will want to work on <br/>\nmaking your AC and saves better, but you shouldn&#39;t have to worry <br/>\nabout that too much for quite some time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Everyone has different opinions on how to play, but the important <br/>\nthing is to have fun. Find some people on your server that play in <br/>\nyour area. Usually you&#39;ll start seeing familiar faces. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lyli<br/>\n&gt; 50 Cleric of Xegony<br/>\n&gt; Dark Reign Order<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Cook Miller-ETOP03 <br/>\n&gt;   To: &#39;EverQuest@y...&#39; <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, August 08, 2001 1:13 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] New EQ Player<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Rico,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I have a 38 dwarf cleric on The Nameless.  A few tips:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   1) Max wisdom - not all subscribe to this, but you have an inate <br/>\nstrength already as a dwarf.  I put my other points to bring up <br/>\neither dex or agility, whichever lower<br/>\n&gt;   2) Find a regular partner to help you to level at the low levels -<br/>\n you can solo first few levels, but I found grouping with one other <br/>\nPC helped<br/>\n&gt;   3) As a cleric, go to Kurn&#39;s tower around level ten - lots of <br/>\nundead to nuke on when alone and clerics were always welcome in <br/>\ngroups there<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Use the other yahoogroups specifically for clerics for more help <br/>\nand advice: EQ_Cleric@y... and EQ-Clerics@y... - Some of the folks <br/>\nthere are quite, er, vocal and opinionated, hehe.  But we all know <br/>\nthat Dwarves make the best clerics - you picked the right race.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Use Caster&#39;s Realm and Rayne&#39;s cleric site for cleric reference <br/>\ninformation.

Beside saving up fo rmy <br/>\n&gt;   spell, I bought the book, should I invest next for my armor? <br/>\nweapon? <br/>\n&gt;   or misc items such as rings?
