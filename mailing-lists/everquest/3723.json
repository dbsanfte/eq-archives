I guess I haven&#39;t been on many raids where people<br/>\nwere purposely screwing around. Most of the time it has been people who were<br/>\nconfused and having lag issues. I tend to raid with people who are friends.<br/>\nMy guildies are good about not screwing around. If something goes wrong it&#39;s<br/>\nnot bc they weren&#39;t trying to listen. Although I think a couple times some<br/>\nnonguildies have joined the raid and then not listened and caused problems.<br/>\nI suppose I might be harsher on non-guildies bc the guildies are all<br/>\nfriends. We&#39;re like a family.<br/>\nOn non-guild raids (by that I mean raids I attended with guilds not my own)<br/>\nI had the misfortune of having the raid leader not listen. I was asked in<br/>\nraid channel to buff certain people by the raid leader. I then needed to<br/>\nmed. I told him I was medding but he went and pulled Vox... I ran out of<br/>\nmana trying to keep my group alive. Lost 3 members of the group after I<br/>\nannounced I was OOM-- just before Vox summoned me over and killed me.<br/>\nCR took a looong time. But I still had fun. Nobody got pissed off. (except<br/>\nfor the corpse puller bc one person kept asking if their corpse had been<br/>\nlocated over and over and over).<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; When the alternative is being alone and ungrouped on a<br/>\n&gt; raid, I&#39;ll assume that accepting the TL is the only<br/>\n&gt; option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And I would never use that tactic with my own<br/>\n&gt; guildies. That&#39;s just rude.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a game. It should be fun. And yeah, getting wiped<br/>\n&gt; out from someone not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; listening isn&#39;t very fun, but I think it&#39;s even less<br/>\n&gt; fun to be nasty to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It has nothing to do with being nasty.  As a RL (or even<br/>\n&gt; a participant in a raid), I have an obligation to<br/>\n&gt; everyone on that raid to make it go as smoothly as<br/>\n&gt; possible.  And if someone is repeatedly doing something<br/>\n&gt; to put the raid at risk, then the RL has an obligation<br/>\n&gt; to &quot;protect&quot; the rest of the raiders.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a 2-way street, Su.  If someone is screwing around,<br/>\n&gt; wasting other people&#39;s time, why should I allow him to<br/>\n&gt; stay on the raid?  I will give respect to nayone that<br/>\n&gt; earns it, but if a person doesn&#39;t have the decency to<br/>\n&gt; respect the RL and the raiders, I&#39;m not going to get<br/>\n&gt; upset when I boot him (or when the RL boots him) from<br/>\n&gt; the raid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A 2hr CR at midnight really sucks, especially if you<br/>\n&gt; have to get up early the next morning for work.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; far worse when it&#39;s caused by some jack@ss that doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; feel the need to listen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not to say we don&#39;t have fun on our raids,<br/>\n&gt; because we do.  But we know that when it&#39;s time to get<br/>\n&gt; to work, the play time stops.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And if I wante to be nasty, I&#39;d leave them in the zone,<br/>\n&gt; ungroupsed, with no way to get out.  Or I&#39;d let them die<br/>\n&gt; and get their own damn corpse.
