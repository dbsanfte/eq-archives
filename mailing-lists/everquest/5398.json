I believe I<br/>\nworked on the 5th shawl for over a year. Well, not the shawl itself, but<br/>\ngetting my skill up. I think I started at level 48 or 49. Possibly 50. I<br/>\nremained level 52 for almost a year. I haven&#39;t leveled in several months.<br/>\nI&#39;m almost 57 now. I have about 5 LDoN adventures under my belt.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if you can get all of the no drop items at your level. You need<br/>\n75 no drop threads from crystalline spiders in velks for the 5th shawl, no<br/>\ndrop sirens hair from either Sirens Grotto or Cobalt Scar (as long as you<br/>\nkeep the sirens chain stunned you can kill them quickly), no drop swordfish<br/>\ntooth from Sirens Grotto.. And I believe you need to have good enough<br/>\nfaction with the Coldain to start the quest to begin with. So you need to<br/>\nhave killed a few drakkel wolves and frost giants in GD or EW.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Gratz!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Might I ask what level you are? I&#39;m trying to start the shawl quest<br/>\n&gt; with my 40 Barbarian Shaman cause he could really use the Flowing<br/>\n&gt; Thought at the end, but didn&#39;t know if I was still to low to work on<br/>\n&gt; the firsth shawl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.551 / Virus Database: 343 - Release Date: 12/11/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
