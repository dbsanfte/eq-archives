I<br/>\n&gt; created a Woodelf Ranger yesterday and planned to<br/>\n&gt; focus on this skill, but a friend has just told me<br/>\n&gt; that Archery is broken and serves no purpose but to<br/>\n&gt; pull albeit from great distances.  I was hoping that<br/>\n&gt; a well developed archer, along with snare could do<br/>\n&gt; most damage to mobs before its arrival.  If this not<br/>\n&gt; true I find it staggering.  Its fine for casters to<br/>\n&gt; snare, DD and DoT - ie fighting from a distance, but<br/>\n&gt; not bow-wielders?  <br/>\n&gt; Any advice and general observations would be kindly<br/>\n&gt; met<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Legless, 8 Ranger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aka Rykk Bloodfang,  52 Monk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************************************************************<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This email and any files transmitted with it are<br/>\n&gt; confidential and<br/>\n&gt; intended solely for the use of the individual or<br/>\n&gt; entity to whom they<br/>\n&gt; are addressed.

By then you should be able<br/>\nto take a ctitical hit of 500 or more with your bow. I<br/>\nsugesst getting a fletching kit and not buying arrows<br/>\nalready made and make your own it should take you that<br/>\nlong to get good at it and then you can fletch bow and<br/>\nsell them for a pretty good amount of money.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nJosh Varner<br/>\nCis 172 student<br/>\npart-time cook<br/>\n336 creekwood ct.<br/>\n746-6132<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
