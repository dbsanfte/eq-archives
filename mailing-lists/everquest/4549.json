Likewise the amount of sheer ABUSE my LAN server gets, and the <br/>\nstability and speed difference once the VM was fixed to reflect <br/>\nchanges in real ram.Overall, spending $50 for a Geforce 2 will be an <br/>\ninvestment you&#39;re likely to be pleased with. Also, if your power <br/>\nsupply is wimpy, consider invest in a bigger one...300 watts should <br/>\nbe plenty for a Geforce 2 and sufficient cooling for everything, but <br/>\n250 will do the trick with less breathing room...any less, upgrade.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Wulfric Rennison <br/>\n&gt;   To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, April 09, 2003 11:17 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: Slow load and zoning<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   You can try all of that stuff, but I would think it&#39;s your CPU <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and video card that&#39;s hampering you more than anything.  I ran EQ on <br/>\na PII 333mhz with an 8MB video card and 8MB accelerator while I was <br/>\nin Japan.  It was slow as molasses.  No matter how many options I <br/>\nturned off.  I noticed moderately better performance once I upgraded <br/>\nthe video card.  Even on my PIII 800 with 640MB of RAM itwould run <br/>\neverything but Luclin.  Then I upgraded the video card to 128MB and <br/>\nit ran fine.   If you really want to improve performance, upgrade <br/>\nyour video card if at all possible.  It can sometimes compensate for <br/>\na slower processor.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   Wulfric<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;     ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;     From: apcooper <br/>\n&gt;     To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com <br/>\n&gt;     Sent: Wednesday, April 09, 2003 6:32 AM<br/>\n&gt;     Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Slow load and zoning<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Thank you very much indeed to everyone who has responded so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>far.
