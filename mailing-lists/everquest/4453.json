I left this group <br/>\nonce before because of idiotic members who insisted on forcing their <br/>\nopinions apon others, and I will not put up with it. I have better things to <br/>\ndo with my time then spend it with opinionated low lifes. Su, I&#39;m sorry for <br/>\neverything, none of this goes to you, I know you tired, but there are just <br/>\ntoo many morons to filter out of the group. To the rest of you, you will <br/>\nnever get anywhere in life with the attitudes you have. Only in a fantasy <br/>\ngame like EverQuest will you ever be something. But at some point you need <br/>\nto grow up and face reality, and it&#39;s not going to be fun or easy when you <br/>\ndo. Do not bother replying to this post. Leave your fights and comments out <br/>\nof Su&#39;s group and for once in your life respect her wishes and be <br/>\nCONSIDERATE. If you forgot what that word means, get a dictionary. If you <br/>\nMUST comment, e-mail me personally, but I most likely will just delete the <br/>\nmessage. Like I said, I have better things to do. Good day.<br/>\n<br/>\n-= Mippon - Level 40 Halfling Druid =-<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
