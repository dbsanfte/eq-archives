This is also the greatest weakness of monks at<br/>\nhigh levels - they have exceptional AC but almost no absorbance,<br/>\nso get hit for huge amounts when the blow lands.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an experiment to see the effects, try equipping a full set of cloth<br/>\narmor ( which as far as I can see has negligible absorbance ) and<br/>\nattacking a blue monster to get an idea of how much damage it does,<br/>\nthen swap the chest piece for something with good absorbance<br/>\nsuch as banded. You will notice that the most of the attacks will do<br/>\nthe same damage, but every so often the monster will hit for much<br/>\nless - this is when the hit lands on your banded piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nA full set does not garauntee the lower damage attacks though -<br/>\na monster of any level always has a chance to do full damage<br/>\nwith an attack and a monster with a much higher attack than your<br/>\ndefense will almost always bypass your armor when it hits you.<br/>\nAlso, your defense is severely decreased when fighting multiple<br/>\noppponents - as an example with a level 15 necromancer in full<br/>\nwoven fighting level 8 skeletons, when fighting one at a time<br/>\nwould rarely get hit for more than 1 point of damage ( the minimum<br/>\nfor a succesfull hit ) but fighting two at once would frequently get hit<br/>\nfor over 10.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor with higher AC values *usually* has a better absorbance,<br/>\nbut this is not always the case - a good example that springs to<br/>\nmind is the lightweight armors from the innothule swamp/guk area.<br/>\nWoven armor has the same AC as patchwork, but absorbs<br/>\nas much damage as leather does, and mesh has the same AC<br/>\nas leather, but absorbs as much damage as chainmail.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I am told that Lockjaw&#39;s tunic and snakeskin armor only<br/>\nabsorb damage as well as leather, despite having a much<br/>\nbetter AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IB_Jason@...\">IB_Jason@...</a>&gt; on 18/06/99 13:21:52<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\ncc:    (bcc: Michael Wyatt/AU/AMP)<br/>\nSubject:  Re: [EverQuest] Bronze Armor, a little explanation please?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IB_Jason@...\">IB_Jason@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHey,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard about absorbtion of armor, but do not understnad the<br/>\nmechanics/formula/general idea behind it. My deep armor knowledge is<br/>\nconfined to games as primal as UO =) Sooo, if you can do a little<br/>\nexplanation of the general differences between AC and Absorbtion, I would<br/>\nbe<br/>\nmost gracious. And also, will I notice a big difference between no armor<br/>\nand<br/>\nmy new Bronze (let&#39;s assume it&#39;s a full suit)? I know it should be an<br/>\nobvious yes, but I have been less than enthralled with armor effects in the<br/>\ngame so far, and am wondering if I&#39;m going to noticed monsters about my<br/>\nlevel that did 20 or so damage suddenly start doing 4 or 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a bunch again,<br/>\n-Rukkak<br/>\n<br/>\n(Just to cover my prospective flame bases, nothin against UO. IT is just my<br/>\npersonal opinion that EQ is faaaaaar better. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael_Wyatt@...\">Michael_Wyatt@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bronze plate, in addition to being extremely heavy, does not<br/>\n&gt;absorb damage as well as normal plate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On the heaviness side - 86lb may not seem like much, until<br/>\n&gt;you factor in that you will be carrying at least 10LB of weapons,<br/>\n&gt;4LB of backpacks, several LB of food and drink, every 40 coins<br/>\n&gt;weighs 1B.
