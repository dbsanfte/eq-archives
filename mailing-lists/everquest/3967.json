I think charging is not a problem. They are giving you access to all servers to &quot;see&quot; what&#39;s going on. The potential for this is great, as they said set up a raid at work monitr activities ( get that buddy of yours who doesn&#39;t work to farm some equip. for you when no one is on ) and so on and so on.&nbsp;The way I figure it if you don&#39;t want to pay don&#39;t get it ( also if you are someone who doesn&#39;t see a need for it i.e. Me ) if you don&#39;t mind paying for it get it. You must realize that you pay for server access with the game and this is going to give you&nbsp; access albiet limited but still access. So if the cost is $10-$12 it will be way too much but $4.99 who knows? \n<p>Freelight Solguard \n<p>46 Pally\n<p>Tribunal\n<p> \n<p>&nbsp;<b><i>alexander.jones@...</i></b> wrote: \n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;\">\n \n<style></style>\n\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-191542537800302306-04112002\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">What attitude?</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-191542537800302306-04112002\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-191542537800302306-04112002\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">You bought a product, end of story.

Transportation system alone will make the game more enjoyable. It costs like 2 months of playtime which would be less than the amount you spend going out for a dinner ONE evening. You seem to have a miserable life and think Sony is to blame for it.</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-191542537800302306-04112002\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-191542537800302306-04112002\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">over and out</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-191542537800302306-04112002\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-191542537800302306-04112002\"></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-191542537OutlookMessageHeader\" lang=\"en-us\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><font face=\"Tahoma\" size=\"2\">-----Original Message-----<br><b>From:</b> Orion [mailto:orionv@...] <br><b>Sent:</b> den 3 november 2002 14:30<br><b>To:</b> EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] EQIM: EverQuest Instant Messaging<br><br></font></div>\n<div><strong><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">Jaggedpine was months ago and yes to all the rest but what have they done for us lately.
