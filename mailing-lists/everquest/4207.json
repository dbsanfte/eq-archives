Apparently quite a few ppl got this game for Christmas because I&#39;ve been seeing lots of &quot;true newbies&quot; for the first time in a long time. Also, I got a RL friend of mine playing just last week. You could group with her, hehe. \n<p>A lot has changed in the game, I think you&#39;d like it. Lower lvls are much easier to get through now.\n<p>&nbsp;<b><i>&quot;Yagermeister &lt;odd_yager@...&gt;&quot; &lt;odd_yager@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;\"><tt>Hey everyone,<br><br>I need some help on my next MPORPG purchase. I played EQ since Beta <br>and quit about 2 and half years ago (college took priority heh) and <br>now that I have secured a somewhat stable career, I&#39;m planning to hit <br>online RPGing again. Question is, being that EQ has been out for 5 <br>years, is it too late to come back and start anew? Meaning am I going <br>to look ridiculous (prolly will regardless) being the only lvl 6 guy <br>on the server in cloth and using fine steel? Or should I look for <br>another MRORPG game?
