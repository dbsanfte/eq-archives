But my<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; typing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends have probably gotten used to me typeing that way so i am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going to keep typeing on eq. But ok see .......am I typeing ok so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; far?? any way, I just  think it is easier and faster so people dont<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; anyway<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to wait forever to hear a response when they want it and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; especially while they are excited...am I correct? I am 14 years old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and going on 9th grade, k-6 is elementry for me and 7 and 8 are<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; elementary<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; middle school and 9-12 is high school..........so I have been going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to school around 10 or 11 years, my mom put me in school when I was 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years old. Ok is everything all cleared up and all or does some one<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; someone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; else have a problem or challenge for me?  c ya l8er......oops i mean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see you all later-----lori<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t bother pointing out the numerous errors in capitalisation and<br/>\n&gt; punctuation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;m not a grammar-nazi, but if someone tries to maintain that<br/>\n&gt; they can do something then make several errors in doing it I feel<br/>\n&gt; obliged to point them out. We learn from our mistakes it is true, but<br/>\n&gt; only once they are pointed out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope you and your friends enjoy EQ Lori, it is a great game, and if<br/>\n&gt; they are fine with the way that you type then that&#39;s cool, but it is<br/>\n&gt; worth learning the standards of the rest of society too so that when you<br/>\n&gt; do need to communicate with people outside your peers you can do so with<br/>\n&gt; ease.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt; Version: 6.0.501 / Virus Database: 299 - Release Date: 14/07/2003<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
