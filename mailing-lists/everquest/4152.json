I went back to Vira, this time for the Shovel. <br/>\nBecause of what happened with the Broom I was extra careful to pay close <br/>\nattention to everything.  I found that she asked for a ruby as one of the <br/>\nitems for the shovel. I brought a fire emerald!  I did so because that is <br/>\nwhat was listed on the eqspoilers site as required.  (To keep up with what I <br/>\nneeded I had the site up and the list visible on a second computer.) I wasn&#39;t <br/>\npaying close enough attention the first time, relying on the site to be <br/>\ncorrect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I discovered this I asked her about the broom again. She asked for a STAR <br/>\nruby, not just a ruby as listed on eqspoilers! I believe this is why I failed <br/>\nwith the broom. I gave her a ruby, not a star ruby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I am not going to give her this fire emerald for the shovel. I am going <br/>\nto go buy a ruby like she says, but unlike what I found on the website.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wednesday 25 December 2002 10:17, Jack Whaley wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  One other thing I just thought about.
