I&#39;ve been to Dalnir in the <br/>\nWarsliks Woods, the Mines of Nurga in the Frontier Mountains and Sol <br/>\nA in Lavastorm.  All of these are boosted experience areas, usually <br/>\n+13%.  So you get an extra boost.  Groups are hit or miss as these <br/>\nplaces are under-utilized since Velious.  I went from 30 to 34 in the <br/>\nOverthere in 3 days, and there&#39;s plenty of groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you&#39;re a permium member on Allakazam&#39;s site you can tailor a <br/>\nseach for just +wis items for Druids.  I find it&#39;s a great help.  But <br/>\na Druid friend of mine says he really see&#39;s no point in upgrading <br/>\narmor, since after 30 you&#39;re mainly a caster and kiter!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n35th season Ranger of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
