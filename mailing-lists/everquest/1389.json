When I first started playing I was actually scared. A thunderstorm<br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; started and I was sitting there wide-eyed asking my sister (over the<br/>\n&gt; phone)<br/>\n&gt; if lightning could hurt people. When I tried to follow her everything<br/>\n&gt; seemd<br/>\n&gt; so big.. I had never played this type of game before. It was amazing...<br/>\n&gt; I still get my pulse up when running from a train. :-)<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am rather new to the game, but one of the things that fascinates me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is the real sense of danger when I put my character in a new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situation. Heart pounds, pulse rate goes up, I even get the shakes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes. I seldom get that in real life, even though I have a job<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that requires occasional physical combat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I love this game!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barto of Rivervale.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
