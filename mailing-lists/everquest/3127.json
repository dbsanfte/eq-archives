When I get lucky I can follow some higher level hunters <br/>\nseeking particular drops. I get the left-overs. I have netted some hq <br/>\nore this way. Lots of other good stuff, as well. Gotten a bit of <br/>\nmoney for permafrost crystals. Sold lots of armor bagged there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe profits have been invested in buying fs weapons in SK. I pay a <br/>\nfair price of 5pp each, and take the items home to Rivervale.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne fs weapon plus one flask of water in the forge nets a small block <br/>\nof ore. <br/>\n<br/>\nSmall block of ore plus a smithing chisel nets two pieces of hq ore.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo pieces of hq ore plus one flask of water nets a bit of hq metal.<br/>\nOr was it two bits? Can&#39;t remember right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the a bit of hq metal, plus a thimble mold, needle mold, and <br/>\na flask of water in the Vale Forge gets me... smithing experience. I <br/>\nhave not yet succeeded in making my Vale Sewing Kit, but I am closing <br/>\non the prize. After that, those nice 100% weight reduction bags. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, the wealth this Halfling shall find after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrange, I am not an optimist in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmph.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
