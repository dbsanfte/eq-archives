Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But \n    since I play the main<br>healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting \n    up to heal) I get<br>totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try \n    to establish alpha<br>loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the \n    casters. All they care<br>about is getting loot for themselves. These people \n    partake in<br>&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody \n    else gets a<br>chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some \n    people will<br>still loot out of turn.<br>And then we have times when people \n    say we roll for certain types of loot.<br>When I first joined a group, this \n    one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br>ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; \n    and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br>picked up an FS morning star and \n    wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an expensive<br>item). He said no, it was \n    only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br>bronze weapon. I said, \n    &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br>for bronze \n    armor&quot;...<br>Has anyone else had this problem?<br>What do you think is the \n    best and fairest loot order?<br>Just wondering.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br>ps. alpha \n    loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br>people \n    cooperate.<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n    use of Yahoo!
