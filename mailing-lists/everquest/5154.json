I <br>am a graduate student at the Institute \n  of Design at Illinois Institute of <br>Technology in Chicago. For one of my \n  classes, entitled Observing Users, we <br>have to study a product and its \n  users. Our group chose Everquest because we <br>think that it is very \n  interesting and complex. As a retired online gamer I know <br>how much fun and \n  involving the games can be. In fact, I am very tempted to <br>jump into \n  Everquest, but I am worried that I may lose concentration on my <br>studies. \n  If anyone is willing to devote a little of their time to helping us out we \n  <br>would really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are poor grad students and \n  will <br>not be able to compensate anyone who helps us out, but we will very \n  very <br>thankful.
