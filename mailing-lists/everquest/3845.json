I&#39;m glad you are checking <br/>\nthis out first before creating one, first let me say that I really <br/>\nenjoy mine and she is a blast to play. As for abilities remember, you <br/>\nhave infravision which will help you see in the dark better than some <br/>\nother races. It&#39;s not perfect but it helps. Also you will be a caster <br/>\nafter lvl 7 so keep that in mind when allocating your extra points. <br/>\nWood Elves are realatively small and aren&#39;t the most strong <br/>\ncharacters to play but they make up for in so many other areas! One <br/>\nthing to keep in mind is SoW, you won&#39;t get it until lvl30, this has <br/>\nbeen p***ing me off, I want it SOOOO bad! lol!<br/>\nAccording to the Official EQ Player&#39;s Guide a Ranger is primarily a <br/>\nmele fighter & part caster and to raise Dex, STR, and WIS first <br/>\nfollowed by Agil, Int, and Char. I made the mistake of raising my Int <br/>\nand not my Wis and it really has hindered my casting. Also look for <br/>\nitems that buff your WIS and INT like jewelry, this will help too. <br/>\nAnother tip for you to help raise your ability as a Ranger is to <br/>\nplace Sense Heading and Track as your first two hot buttons. Then <br/>\nunder the Options section map those two hot keys to your left and <br/>\nright arrows or whatever you use to turn your character. This way <br/>\neverytime you turn it will activate one or the other and before you <br/>\nknow it your skill level in them will shoot through the roof! <br/>\nOh one more tip, if you decide to try the Trushot Armor Quest be sure <br/>\nto grab several Orc Fibulas if they tend to drop a lot, you will need <br/>\nat least 5 I think but try to grab about 10. They are non-drop so <br/>\nunfortunately you can&#39;t sell or give away the extras. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
