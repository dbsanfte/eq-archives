Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main\n<br>healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get\n<br>totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha\n<br>loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they care\n<br>about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in\n<br>&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a\n<br>chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will\n<br>still loot out of turn.\n<br>And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.\n<br>When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a\n<br>ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he\n<br>picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an expensive\n<br>item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a\n<br>bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only\n<br>for bronze armor&quot;...\n<br>Has anyone else had this problem?\n<br>What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?\n<br>Just wondering.\n<br>luv,\n<br>-Su\n<br>ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when\n<br>people cooperate.</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br>\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\"><b><i>\n<br></i></b></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
