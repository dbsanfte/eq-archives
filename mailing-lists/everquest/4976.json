But I&#39;ve been in Dulak a lot lately<br/>\n&gt; and each ship is a camp.  Passing through the old camp areas I have<br/>\n&gt; heard camp checks, but not as often as in the old days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One thing I&#39;ve noticed is people usually call camp checks if they plan to<br/>\ncamp a particular mob or they plan to do something that could effect the<br/>\nmobs in the zone aside from a few.  Hollowshade is one example, there are<br/>\nmobs that people farm for substances to smith, however those same mobs can<br/>\nbe replaced by new mobs that don&#39;t have the substances they want by just a<br/>\nfew kills in one area.  Usually if i was planning  on hunting a pertucular<br/>\nmob that can be effected as such...i usually ask what camps anyone has to<br/>\nmake sure i&#39;m not going to interfer with them, but if noone replys what can<br/>\nyou do....noone can read their minds...they might tell me they were later,<br/>\nand often i appologize saying I asked but noone said anything..they usually<br/>\nunderstand and we try to get the mobs they were hunting back if they<br/>\ndespawned for another set.  But those that don&#39;t pay attention sound like<br/>\nthey are relying on a timer and not paying attention..thats not a true camp<br/>\nIMHO.   A camp is a site where someone is watching for the enemy...not<br/>\nrelying on game programming to determine when that mob is there.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>\npeople sitting around the guys spawn point in QH a good hour or 2 before his<br/>\nscedualed pop...just to make sure they tell anyone who shows up they are<br/>\nthere.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
