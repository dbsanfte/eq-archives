She, <br/>\nhowever, is an email junkie, and so not opposed to the machine which <br/>\nsucks away my life. Our addictions are different, yet have common <br/>\nground.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf my three children only one has grown to be a gamer. He and I play <br/>\nin shifts, making room for my wife to check her email once in a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find my addiction to be satisfying, affordable, and much healthier <br/>\nthan smoking. Since I cannot drink much and play EQ, I need not fear <br/>\ndemon alcohol. My primary addiction keeps me safe from other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be eight years until I can actually retire. That will be two <br/>\nsystems from now, probably at the beginning of EQ3.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy then I will be able to move someplace very affordable, and order <br/>\nall that life requires over the intrenet. I will be fully involved in <br/>\nEQ3, and never have to face real life again.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps by EQ4 there will be total body interface systems. With <br/>\nautomatic hydration systems and drip-feed nutrition. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone say &quot;Lawnmower Man?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
