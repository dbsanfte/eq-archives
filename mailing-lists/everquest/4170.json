The Ti is only bettered by the new <br/>\nRadion. The Mx is just a hotrod Gforce2. I have the Mx only because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have an agp slot on my Emachine. Had to get the best pci I <br/>\ncould, which was the Mx.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the greatest difference you will see is in lag. Line lag it <br/>\ncan&#39;t help, but lag internal to your system is. With the 64mb memory <br/>\nyou won&#39;t get the same performance as the 128, as more memory is the <br/>\nkey to better eq. Still, you should see an improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Justin&quot; &lt;pavisoj@q...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;     I have a question for you all.

Will I see much of <br/>\na difference?  I was just wondering about that because I remember a <br/>\nwhile back a discussion about the cards on this board before.  Well I <br/>\nwould apperciate any comments on this topic.  according to the <br/>\nmanufacturer did say theis card did better than thier 128 mb version <br/>\nof the same card due to the clock speed of the ram.
