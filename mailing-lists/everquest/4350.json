I&#39;m glad you figured everything out. It takes some time getting <br/>\nuse to the game and getting to know all of the buttons and comands, but you <br/>\nwill catch on. If you ever need any help, just shout for it using either <br/>\n/shout or /ooc and most of the time someone in the zone will be able to help <br/>\nyou out. When I first started, I remember I was a wreck. I thought I would <br/>\nnever learn everything there was to know, but I did, and you will too. Good <br/>\nluck and have fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
