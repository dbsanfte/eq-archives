I think skill is not the only issue. It&#39;s also a matter of \n  gear, class, and internet connection. Classes with pets, slows, and snares \n  have an advantage. Sure clerics can heal themselves, but only if they don&#39;t \n  get interrupted. Since omens came out I have been fizzling a LOT more for no \n  reason. Plus I have satellite internet which causes some upload latency. The \n  way the damage system is setup I get damage misreports and take 100+ damage \n  from an 18 damage hit. I was nearly owned by green mobs in straightup melee \n  even with haste and a delay 18 weapon with a proc. My spells were interrupted, \n  I lagged and couldn&#39;t get other spells off, and root was breaking instantly. I \n  was told that if I had ornate or elemental armor I would have a better chance \n  soloing.<br>I just wish they had tasks categorized as easy, medium, and \n  difficult, as well as short, medium, etc.. <br>Zoning can take a long time for \n  me so running from DL to Sebilis can take more time than I want to spend doing \n  a task.<br>I agree that it would be nice to get a more tangible \n  reward.<br>-Su<br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
