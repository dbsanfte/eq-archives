Lag was terrible. It<br/>\n&gt; was hard to even get my cursor on target. I suppose it will be ok<br/>\n&gt; once I get set up to sell, but the set up is terrible. Move cursor.<br/>\n&gt; Not on object. Move a bit more. Not on object. Move back. Click.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t have object. Click again. Hmph. Had object but didn&#39;t know it,<br/>\n&gt; and just put it back. Click...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Took so long that I didn&#39;t finish setting up before I had to log. I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have logged if I could have left my toon to do business<br/>\n&gt; while I was gone, but no such luck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just gotta get another machine, faster connection, and retire from<br/>\n&gt; my job so that I can play all the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
