I would have a hard time remember too if mine wasn&#39;t \n  at the top of the list.&nbsp; I used to be on dialup but my phonelines kept \n  deteriorating. When the bandwidth dropped under 10k we had to get satellite. \n  Once when it was raining and lost satellite I dialed up but was only at 6.2k. \n  On a later attempt the bandwidth was too low to even dialup at all. The phone \n  company denies there is anything wrong with the lines so we can&#39;t get them to \n  do anythign about it. So we are completely on satellite now. It&#39;s supposed to \n  be about 800k dl speed and 50k upload. However, they tend to cap usage if you \n  load more than a certain amount. Because of the delay with the satellite \n  signal I get over 800ms ping. I pretty much average around 3kms. It makes \n  things tough in WoW, but it&#39;s still doable. Death in WoW is easier to deal \n  with than death in EQ. I kinda wish EQ would change it so you no longer lost \n  xp on death, but I doubt they will. I would be willing to sacrifice some cash \n  for armor repair or such <br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>====== At 2005-03-02, 02:42:00 \n  you wrote: =======<br><br>&gt;DOH!!!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Umm......
