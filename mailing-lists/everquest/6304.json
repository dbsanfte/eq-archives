It contains all the information \n      you will<br>&gt; need to hit the ground running and make the most \n      of<br>&gt; your time in beta. Remember, you accepted the<br>&gt; EverQuest \n      Terms of Use, License and Non-Disclosure<br>&gt; Agreement as a condition \n      for acceptance into the<br>&gt; beta program, and everything included here \n      as well<br>&gt; as what you see on the beta server, in \n      beta-related<br>&gt; communications and beta forums and message \n      boards<br>&gt; are covered by that agreement. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n      HOW DO I GET ON THE BETA SERVER?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In order to access the \n      Depths of Darkhollow beta<br>&gt; server, you will need to download the \n      Beta patcher.<br>&gt; The FTP site for downloading the patcher is \n      listed<br>&gt; below. There may be a lot of data to download, so<br>&gt; \n      please be patient.&nbsp; You should run this patcher<br>&gt; before you \n      log in, every time.&nbsp; Failing to do so may<br>&gt; cause you to \n      experience crashes or gameplay issues<br>&gt; that could be fixed just by \n      patching.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; You may download the Depths of \n      Darkhollow beta<br>&gt; patcher at the following FTP site<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n      <br>&gt; FTP Site omitted due to NDA.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; To get to \n      the ftp site:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Enter the ftp address into your Internet \n      Explorer<br>&gt; web browser.&nbsp; It will bring you to the ftp site. \n      The<br>&gt; file you need is called EQBetaPatcher.zip.&nbsp; Just<br>&gt; \n      right click on the file and copy it to your desktop.<br>&gt;&nbsp; Unzip \n      the file and copy betaeverquest.exe into your<br>&gt; root EverQuest \n      directory (Should be in C:&#92;Program<br>&gt; Files&#92;Sony&#92;EverQuest unless you \n      changed your default<br>&gt; installation.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Run this \n      every time prior to logging in to the beta<br>&gt; server. You will see \n      the Beta Server on the server<br>&gt; list, choose that server and log \n      in.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW LONG IS BETA?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The beta \n      test is scheduled to begin on July 20th,<br>&gt; 2005 and is scheduled to \n      end on September 13th,<br>&gt; 2005, unless we decide to change these \n      dates.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW DO I GET TO THE DoD ZONES?<br>&gt; \n      <br>&gt; When you get onto the beta server, create your<br>&gt; character \n      and head to the Plane of Knowledge. Find<br>&gt; Old Man Thorren and he \n      can teleport you to Corathus<br>&gt; Creep.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW \n      DO I COPY MY CHARACTER ONTO BETA?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For us to copy your \n      favorite EverQuest character to<br>&gt; the beta server, please indicate \n      which character you<br>&gt; want us to copy by logging into your play \n      server as<br>&gt; your favorite character. You indicate that you \n      want<br>&gt; us to copy an individual character by typing the<br>&gt; \n      command /beta in your chat window. Periodically we<br>&gt; will run \n      scripts that will copy characters to the<br>&gt; beta server. Keep in mind \n      that we will be running<br>&gt; the character copies on an as-needed basis \n      - not<br>&gt; necessarily at regular intervals. It may take<br>&gt; \n      several days for us to copy your character.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; THE \n      /betabuff COMMAND<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The level range needed to test all of \n      the variations<br>&gt; of dungeons for&nbsp; DoD is huge.&nbsp; In order \n      to give you<br>&gt; that ability to test as much of the expansion \n      as<br>&gt; possible, we have created a /betabuff command. <br>&gt; Here&#39;s \n      how you use it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. Create a first level character on the \n      beta server<br>&gt; and log in with that character (this command \n      will<br>&gt; only work on 1st level characters).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. Type \n      /betabuff CLASS LEVEL - where CLASS is the<br>&gt; class of the character \n      you would like to create, and<br>&gt; LEVEL is the level that you want \n      that character to<br>&gt; be.&nbsp; LEVEL can only be numbers divisible by \n      5,<br>&gt; starting at 20.&nbsp; So 20, 25, 30, etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n      That&#39;s it.&nbsp; The character you created will be<br>&gt; transformed \n      into a character of the level and class<br>&gt; you have chosen.&nbsp; \n      Your race and even gender may<br>&gt; change as well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n      <br>&gt; BETA FEEDBACK<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There are two methods for passing \n      information to us<br>&gt; about what you experience during the \n      beta.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; /bug should be used to report bugs.&nbsp; Bugs \n      are<br>&gt; gameplay features that do not work, spelling errors,<br>&gt; \n      and anything that just does not work as intended. <br>&gt; Please give us \n      as much detail about the bug as you<br>&gt; can think of when reporting \n      it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; /feedback should be used to send in comments \n      about<br>&gt; parts of the expansion that work properly, but that<br>&gt; \n      you would like to see changed.&nbsp; If you discover an<br>&gt; item that \n      you think should have less Wis and more<br>&gt; Int, then use \n      /feedback.&nbsp; If you think a certain<br>&gt; encounter is too easy or \n      too hard, use /feedback to<br>&gt; report it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It is \n      important that you distinguish between these<br>&gt; two options, as one \n      is read primarily by our testing<br>&gt; team and the other is read mostly \n      by our game<br>&gt; designers.&nbsp; Sending a bug through /feedback \n      can<br>&gt; delay our ability to fix it, since we&#39;ll have to<br>&gt; route \n      that to our testers for verification.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Please use this \n      command to explore as many of the<br>&gt; adventures as you can and report \n      your findings to<br>&gt; us.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you find yourself in dire \n      need of assistance, you<br>&gt; can use /petition to contact us for \n      help.&nbsp; Please<br>&gt; only petition if the situation is one that you \n      can&#39;t<br>&gt; correct yourself.&nbsp; For example, if you used<br>&gt; \n      /betabuff to create a character and you have lost<br>&gt; the corpse, \n      there is no need to /petition.&nbsp; You can<br>&gt; just log out, create \n      a new character and use the<br>&gt; /betabuff command again.<br>&gt; \n      <br>&gt; Please remember that your participation in the beta<br>&gt; \n      program is subject to the Terms of Use, License and<br>&gt; Non-Disclosure \n      Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) which you<br>&gt; have already agreed to. Your \n      access in and to the<br>&gt; beta program, including the patcher, is for \n      your<br>&gt; personal, non-commercial use only, in accordance<br>&gt; with \n      the Agreement, and any feedback you provide is<br>&gt; \n      confidential.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you for your time and effort; we \n      appreciate<br>&gt; your help testing this expansion.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n      Sincerely,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The EverQuest Depths of Darkhollow \n      Development Team<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n      <br><br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do You \n      Yahoo!?<br>Tired of spam?&nbsp; Yahoo!
