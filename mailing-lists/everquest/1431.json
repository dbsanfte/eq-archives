I would<br/>\n&gt; greatly appreciate any feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Woohoo!! Congrats, rogues are a fun class to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1)  How does &quot;sneak&quot; work exactly?  Can I sneak across someone&#39;s line of<br/>\n&gt; sight?  What is the difference between &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; that comes later?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sneak, when successful, makes you walk &quot;quietly&quot; (slowly) by/near mobs without <br/>\nbeing seen.  However, usually if you are in the mobs line of sight it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork that often.  It&#39;s great for sneaking behind mobs to get past them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHide, by itself, makes you invisible but you can&#39;t move.  If you Hide AND Sneak<br/>\n(forget which order you need to do it in; i have it hot keyed :) ), you can <br/>\nbascially walk around invis. :)  Be sure to keep both skills MAXED.  It&#39;s a<br/>\nreal life and corpse saver.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI have fun hide/sneaking up to mobs and attempting to pickpocket them. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.  Does it do me any good to<br/>\n&gt; attack monsters from behind without the ability yet?  I have been making an<br/>\n&gt; effort to do just that, but should I not even bother?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Contrary to belief, hitting a mob from behind does give extra bonus.  About<br/>\n2 years ago Verant posted there is an extra (if slight) benefit from attacking<br/>\nbehind; lower AC?  While fighting mutiple mobs, people have noticed that they<br/>\nget hit harder from behind than in front.  Stick a green mob behind you, and note<br/>\nthe average damage.  Then turn around; the average damage is less.  This is why most<br/>\nppl try to get the mobs all in front of them instead of having some behind them. <br/>\nThough the mob templates differ from characters, the principle is the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow when you get the backstab ability, you&#39;ll really wreak havoc!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot recall<br/>\n&gt; having ever seen or heard of a trap in EQ.  Can anyone give an example of<br/>\n&gt; where and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>\n&gt; there is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Disarm Traps skill was basically a non usuable skill, until the Velious<br/>\nexpansion launched.   The Disarm Traps skill will come in very handy in the<br/>\nland of Velious.  Hmmm.. then again, our group usually sets them off so we<br/>\ncan have something to kill (assuming mobs spawn when triggered).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the old world (non expansion lands), I don&#39;t know of any traps to<br/>\npractice skills on.  I know of a locked door in freeport, by the docks, that<br/>\nyou can probably practice lock picking, but that&#39;s about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bah, better to ask questions than be a useless rogue; and believe me, i&#39;ve<br/>\nran into some doozies. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep those piercing skills up! And if you can afford it, grab a bow and fletching<br/>\nkit and make some arrows.  It makes pulling mobs eaiser.  The one thing I found<br/>\nreally annoying was sneaking into position to fight a mob only to have it casted<br/>\non by some caster a mile away.   Now I just &quot;appear&quot; out of no where, fling the bow,<br/>\nkill the mob, and disappear again. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n -Knight</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
