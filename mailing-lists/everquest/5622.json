This is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>something completely separate that they implemented for the 5th Year<br/>\nAnniversary.  Many people have already done this quest.  The prize is<br/>\na Staff of Endless Adventuring which serves absoluitely no purpose<br/>\nexcept to shoot off fireworks.   There are different kinds though. <br/>\nEach staff has its own set of fireworks.  The type is based on the<br/>\ncharacter creation date.  What you get is a Collector&#39;s Sack.  Then<br/>\nyou find the 10 items the book suggests and put them in the pack and<br/>\nhit Combine.  This will create a Sealed Collector&#39;s Sack which you<br/>\ngive back to the NPC who gave them to you.  He will then give you the<br/>\nstaff in return.  The quest is fairly easy to anyone over level 50 as<br/>\nall the mobs will con green.  If you&#39;re a non-porter type, it may take<br/>\nyou awhile to run from zone to zone.  If you have a porter friend who<br/>\nhasn&#39;t done the quest, they can take you around and you can help each<br/>\nother get the pieces.  I finished the quest in about 3 hours with my<br/>\n55 druid.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The items you need to collect all start with &quot;A Collector&#39;s...&quot;  You<br/>\n </span></blockquote>can&#39;t put just any item in there.

But after I got it, I just kept clicking<br/>\nit over and over cause the effect is so damn cool!  Make sure you have<br/>\nspell effects turned on and Opacity to full.

His<br/>\n&gt;   name was Samuel Peltzgum. He gave me a combining rucksack and a list<br/>\n&gt;   of clues for the mission. I have been puzzling about the clues,<br/>\n&gt;   finding this mission a bit cryptic. While defending myself from<br/>\n&gt;   skeleton warriors in East Commonlands, I aquired a rusty halberd. When<br/>\n&gt;   I looted it, the halberd dropped into the rucksack.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I saw a similar NPC in Kaladim, I think it was.
