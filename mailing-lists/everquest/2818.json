Most things are reachable through /commands in the chat bar. try<br/>\n/help and read some.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also have a hot key bank, you need to assign skills to buttons and<br/>\nprobably you will want put the button in your hot-key bank. try to structure<br/>\nit early into types of banks. Combat, traveling and so on. find a system<br/>\nthat suits you. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to delve into the more advanced commands then maybe perhaps<br/>\naffix sense heading to your slam button or something like that. This will<br/>\nmax out Sense heading very fast. Or filter out your hits out of the chatbox,<br/>\nthis gets annoying fast when you got double attack and dual wield. hard to<br/>\nread things then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many many things that makes the ui better, there is no set way of<br/>\nwhats good and bad just preference. IT also varies as yo pass through<br/>\nlevels. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you like to raid a lot and are playing in large groups, remember<br/>\nserverfilter is your friend and DONT forget to set your datarate.txt to<br/>\nappropriate value. Your friends will love it even more than you not having<br/>\nto wait for ld people all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think you have some learning to do before this, keep it up.<br/>\nExperiment, learn. dont just take it from everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Ranina<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: muaddib74447 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:muaddib1974@...\">muaddib1974@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 03, 2002 3:07 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] I just want to let you know!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n  I am really impressed with the game!!!!
