What a conversation starter!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; G&#39;Fay is famous for the /ooc beggar.  I, like you,<br/>\n&gt; usually end up &quot;chiding&quot;<br/>\n&gt; any beggar that pollutes the chat with a constant<br/>\n&gt; cry for platinum or even<br/>\n&gt; Power Leveling and gear. But, I have never been<br/>\n&gt; accused of being too harsh<br/>\n&gt; with someone.  Most people start sending me tells<br/>\n&gt; agreeing with me about<br/>\n&gt; stupid beggars, and then they /ooc support to my<br/>\n&gt; discouragement of begging.<br/>\n&gt; And NOTHING pisses me off more than the ungrateful<br/>\n&gt; player. I have on<br/>\n&gt; occasion given some plat or newbie gear to people<br/>\n&gt; that wouldn&#39;t stop begging<br/>\n&gt; just to shut them up. And yes, I would say that most<br/>\n&gt; of the begging souls<br/>\n&gt; that I have donated anything to were just as<br/>\n&gt; ungrateful as the chap that you<br/>\n&gt; described.  They can&#39;t even bother to type 2 letters<br/>\n&gt; -TY- or God forbid that<br/>\n&gt; they might actually /bow or /kneel or /thank... <br/>\n&gt; &lt;:-P&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I too often seek out young players above 3rd or 4th<br/>\n&gt; season that appear to be<br/>\n&gt; working hard to advance themselves the way that most<br/>\n&gt; of us did as<br/>\n&gt; NewB&#39;s....and while I expect nothing in return for<br/>\n&gt; the small gifts that I<br/>\n&gt; give. I find that more often than not these players<br/>\n&gt; are very thankful and<br/>\n&gt; benevolent.  It just makes me feel all warm and<br/>\n&gt; fuzzy to make some new<br/>\n&gt; player&#39;s day.<br/>\n&gt; I have found that it &quot;pays&quot; to work hard for the<br/>\n&gt; things that you want--in RL<br/>\n&gt; and in EQ.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was going to say something about how all beggars<br/>\n&gt; should publicly die slow<br/>\n&gt; cruel deaths in explicit detail, but I&#39;ll leave it<br/>\n&gt; to your imagination----<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Redfists Bakdafugup - Cleric of His Holiness, Brell<br/>\n&gt; Serilis<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ( I can be found on the Druzzil Ro server at odd<br/>\n&gt; times of the day and night,<br/>\n&gt; feel free to say hello or even BEG from me, well<br/>\n&gt; that is to say that if you<br/>\n&gt; would like to make the list of people that will<br/>\n&gt; never ever ever get a free<br/>\n&gt; or cheap REZ from me you should definitely beg.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
