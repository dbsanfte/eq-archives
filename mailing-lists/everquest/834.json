Banded is a much better choice<br/>\nfor a rangers standard issue under level 25.  Blackened iron is heavy and<br/>\nhas less AC.  I&#39;m not saying Banded is the best overall, however its one of<br/>\nthe only armor sets a ranger can wear.. besides the silver plated bracers<br/>\nand leggings.  But, if you can get your hands on those.. you can start<br/>\nacquiring the ivy etched gear.  There is one exception.. Blackened iron<br/>\nboots are great to have if you cant get dwarven workboots. Sure they have<br/>\none less ac as the banded, however they can kick for magic.. that always<br/>\ncomes in handy. =) <br/>\n<br/>\nDuhase<br/>\nLevel 43 Ranger<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debbiquilt@...\">debbiquilt@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debbiquilt@...\">debbiquilt@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 17, 2000 10:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] psyched now!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debbiquilt@...\">debbiquilt@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHa, last night I was admiring a ranger in blackened iron armour (was real <br/>\ncute too) and he up and gave me a tunic and leggings.  Now, I&#39;m not one to <br/>\nstand in front of a mirror primping, but I sure look good!  I need to add <br/>\nsomething for strength though.  I have a studded collar and a cutthroat <br/>\ninsigna ring, but I need lots and lots of strength, any suggestions?  Why do<br/>\n<br/>\nI need more strength you may ask, I need the weight capacity.  I only have<br/>\n75 <br/>\nnaturally.  My armour takes up most of that and i no longer run while in run<br/>\n<br/>\nmode-more like crawl.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, where can I get more of this blackened iron?<br/>\n<br/>\nPanolasi, lvl 10 half-elf Ranger <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
