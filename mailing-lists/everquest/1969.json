Do you know the brand name?<br/>\nWhat type of internet connection do you have?<br/>\nIf it&#39;s a phone line connection, pick up the receiver on your phone (while<br/>\noffline) and see if you hear static. If you hear static, your lines are<br/>\ndisrupted. In which case you either call the phone company and tell them to<br/>\nrepair your lines (which they are obligated to do bc you are paying for the<br/>\nservice of having decent lines) or check for sources of disruption. Running<br/>\nyour phone line (and cable modem lines/ethernet cables) through a surge<br/>\nsuppressor can disrupt it. You lines being too close to a power cord can<br/>\ndisrupt it. Make sure your monitor and computer power cords are not right<br/>\nnext to or touching your line.<br/>\nAlso, the speed of your processor and the amount of RAM you have on your<br/>\ncomputer can affect the speed of your connection if you are using a<br/>\nSoftModem/Winmodem (any modem that runs off of software rather than a<br/>\nhardware chipset). Go to www.56k.com to look for your modem and see if it is<br/>\nmarked as a bad modem and/or check for updates in drivers for it. I found a<br/>\nnice init string to keep my mother&#39;s Lucent Winmodem from disconnecting<br/>\nevery two minutes- which gave me time to download the new drivers for the<br/>\nmodem.<br/>\nMy ISP also mentioned a website called modemhelp.com but I haven&#39;t visited<br/>\nit yet.<br/>\nIf you have windows XP try going to www.tweakxp.com it has all sorts of info<br/>\non how to make your computer run faster and get rid of unneccessary junk. I<br/>\nthink my father said there&#39;s another one called tweakui for different<br/>\noperating systems but I haven&#39;t looked yet.<br/>\nIf you are able to get a new modem, I recommend the Zoom v92. It comes with<br/>\nbuilt in lightning protect and a 7 yr warrenty. I got mine for around $21.<br/>\nAny new hardware you want to get you can search for at www.pricegrabber.com<br/>\nIt lists reviews of products as well as the stores selling them. I&#39;ve found<br/>\nit extremely useful.<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My internet connection sucks SOOOO bad, that after doing a system restore<br/>\n&gt; and reinstalling eq, I haven&#39;t been able to experience the SoL probs, I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>got<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my own...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All I gotta say is....
