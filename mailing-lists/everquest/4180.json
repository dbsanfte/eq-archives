I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; having trouble with part of it that requires Mossy<br/>\n&gt; Rat Pelts. I have obtained several Ruined and<br/>\n&gt; undamaged rat pelts but no plain ol&#39; mossy. All the<br/>\n&gt; research I have done seems to suggest the diseased<br/>\n&gt; rats drop these so I have been hunting them for<br/>\n&gt; about a week now and no pelts. Does anyone know if<br/>\n&gt; they do drop them, if they are rare, no-drop and<br/>\n&gt; such? Any info would be greatly appriciated. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at<br/>\n&gt; Mail.com<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\">http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Meet Singles<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://corp.mail.com/lavalife\">http://corp.mail.com/lavalife</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ye<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
