It was good leveling and they dropped some decent coin for a lower level player. Well I havened to meet up with two Dark Elves from Germany. one spoke no english but the other was able to translate for her. They asked me to join their group and I did. I have to say that was one of the funnest groups I have ever been in! I&#39;m kind of a communications buff so it was very fun for me to watch and read the chat between them. It was also a good opportunity for me to maybe pick up a few new words! <br/>\n<br/>\nC-ya!<br/>\nDurgaa<br/>\nShizney<br/>\nGenmay<br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nSteven R.
