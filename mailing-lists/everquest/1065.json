I&#39;m a level 8 Half Elf ranger (first character) and I want <br/>\nto train up some of my abilities beyond the 5 practice credits I get <br/>\nwhen I level.  I&#39;ve noticed several skills that have what look like <br/>\nprices (coins of varying colors with numbers inside them) but I have <br/>\nbeen unable to get the trainers to teach me those skills.  When I <br/>\nclick practice (after putting my practice credits into another <br/>\nskill), it tells me that I&#39;m out of practice credits and have to go <br/>\nadventuring some more.  Is there ANY way to pay gold (or silver or <br/>\ncopper) for training?  If so, HOW?  What do I click and all?  It <br/>\nshows my available money and I&#39;ve got the cash, but I just can&#39;t seem <br/>\nto get the trainer to take the money and train me.<br/>\nThanks for any help.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
