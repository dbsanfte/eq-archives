I got started playin EQ a few months ago, <br/>\non a friend&#39;s account, and got my bard to lvl 34 before he pretty <br/>\nmuch wouldn&#39;t let me play anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;ve got my own account, and my main is a lvl 31 cleric. Getting <br/>\nthere was pretty easy, I just did everything I&#39;d already done <br/>\nbefore. One of my RL friends helps me whenever he&#39;s on, but we can&#39;t <br/>\nalways be on at the same time, and he&#39;s usually busy off on some <br/>\nraid with his guild. Plus I&#39;m getting tired of bugging him all the <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where do I go from here? Where are the best places for xp? Are <br/>\nthere any quests or anything that I should be doing, and what? I <br/>\nwould very much appreciate any suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaielenie<br/>\nlvl 31 cleric<br/>\nFennin Ro server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
