But they are still addicted.. They can hate Sony and hate Verant but<br/>\nstill be addicted and want to play.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; BWHAAA HA HA HA HA HA HA!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sony&#39;s plan to addict all known peoples and make zombies out of them has<br/>\n&gt; claimed another soul for their army of consumers! Soon the market will<br/>\n&gt; be flooded with Sony Zombies buying everything related to Sony and<br/>\n&gt; Everquest. The brainwashing is working perfectly!<br/>\n&gt; The fools! Do they not realize the power that Sony has over them?<br/>\n&gt; Do they not realize the contributions they are making to the<br/>\n&gt; capitalistic ways of the Sony Clan?<br/>\n&gt; As long as this plan holds there is no telling how far it can go! Sony<br/>\n&gt; will rule the world!!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (he, he, he. Sorry, don&#39;t know where that came from!) Anyway I really<br/>\n&gt; need to get back to playing Everquest!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Acts very jittery and rubs inside of arm intensely.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;  Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Jul 2002 08:56:01 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Melanie Roark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melanie_6602@...\">melanie_6602@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 543<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess I got lucky.
