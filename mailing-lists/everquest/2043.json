Sorry I missed that.<br/>\nWhat did you say to the faeries for them to give you gifts and stuff?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Did anyone else happen to catch this? I was in GFay<br/>\n&gt; with my halfling druid memming spells when suddenly<br/>\n&gt; there was a zone wide message of &quot;You hear faeries<br/>\n&gt; giggling&quot;, then a handful of faeries started to talk<br/>\n&gt; about wanting to play hide and go seek. After doing a<br/>\n&gt; quick &quot;/who&quot; on one and getting &quot;there are no players<br/>\n&gt; in this zone under this name&quot; I lept up and started<br/>\n&gt; running madly around Kelethin trying to find them. A<br/>\n&gt; few other players caught on rather quickly and started<br/>\n&gt; a zone wide game of hide and seek. :) I found a couple<br/>\n&gt; of them on the ground after a while and since I was<br/>\n&gt; playing a halfling didn&#39;t mind getting into the whole<br/>\n&gt; thing. (&quot;hee hee! I&#39;ve found you, now it&#39;s off to find<br/>\n&gt; the others!&quot; ;) Eventually things culminated just<br/>\n&gt; outside of Felwithe where about 25 or so players<br/>\n&gt; gathered around the faeries. Unfortunately a couple of<br/>\n&gt; blithering morons decided it was a good idea to attack<br/>\n&gt; and managed to deal on average 2-3 points of dmg (one<br/>\n&gt; per swing, zero per spell) and get laughed at. The<br/>\n&gt; faeries handed out gifts to a couple of people, one<br/>\n&gt; got a Mithiril Breastplate, don&#39;t know about anything<br/>\n&gt; else. (I didn&#39;t get anything) Then the faeries blinded<br/>\n&gt; us all a few times, gave everyone levitate, and left<br/>\n&gt; citing the &quot;meanies who tried to hurt us&quot; as their<br/>\n&gt; reason. It was pretty cool for my first GM event, and<br/>\n&gt; if nothing else, levitate is a ton of fun, all the<br/>\n&gt; newbies were having a blast with it. :) (I still think<br/>\n&gt; the most frightening thing an Orc will ever see is a<br/>\n&gt; flying halfling coming to cleave them in half ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Send your holiday cheer with <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.ca\">http://greetings.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
