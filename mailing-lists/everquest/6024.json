Secound i could get power lvled to 30 but ass naked if need <br/>\nbe. Gear just makes it eaasyer on the druid. However you find  druid <br/>\nto lvl you and Useually  that well toss you crap out of the bank at <br/>\nyou (what iam wearing)in fact my pants ar ac 4. and as far as zones <br/>\ngo well i just bought the plat cd set and it has all but one zone on <br/>\nit. 90 percent of the sets you buy today well have these zones if by <br/>\nchance you find the origanle eq game in the bargain  bin its still <br/>\ncheaper to buy the platinum cd set. so IAM sorry you cant seem to <br/>\nfind a druid to help you. the thread was on how to. not how to get <br/>\nsome one to do so. Iam an experinced player, and know how where and <br/>\nwhen.  As a rogue iam grp dependent on groups yet i can still solo. <br/>\nonly by knowledge and bandaids lot of bandaids. if your a casual <br/>\nplayer with one or two hours a week to play try a staarting a druid <br/>\nand then you could power lvl yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Steven R.
