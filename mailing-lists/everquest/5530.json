Multi Users?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you do I seriously wouldn&#39;t suggest letting a friend use your<br/>\naccount.  While I was on westpac for 9 months I let my friend (who<br/>\nintroduced me into EQ) use my account since I wouldn&#39;t be able to play<br/>\nwhile I was overseas in the gulf.  Well when I came back all my<br/>\ncharacters were naked and all they had in their inventorys were trader&#39;s<br/>\nsacks.  Of course they were in the bazaar.  All my gear on all my<br/>\ncharacters had been sold in the bazaar and I had some really expensive<br/>\nstuff like a couple 30k horses. Of course it was my fault giving him my<br/>\naccount to use in the first place. If you are worried about loosing all<br/>\nyour gear then take my advice - never give your account to your friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nBloodbrood Deathdisciple &lt;Ceatlitus&gt;<br/>\nShadowknight of the 30th Season<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Techpriest [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:techpriest@...\">techpriest@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 26, 2004 8:41 PM<br/>\nTo: EverQuest (E-mail)<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Items lost after account cancel? Multi Users?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am back in school and working full time so I don&#39;t have time for all<br/>\nmy hobbies.  I was thinking of canceling my EQ account for the semester<br/>\nand picking it back up later.  I am only 2 semester from graduation<br/>\n(then I will have a degree showing I can do what I have been doing for<br/>\nthe past 8 years). How long after you cancel your account will your<br/>\nstuff get erased?  I would hate to start back up later and find all my<br/>\nloot was gone.  While paying for the account would not break me I just<br/>\nhate the feeling that I am wasting money that could be better spent on<br/>\nmy RC racing hobby.  Sorry, won&#39;t give up RC for EQ.  It gets me out of<br/>\nthe house and with real people, and sadly is the second most physical<br/>\nactivity I engage in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did have another idea.  Let a friend use the account and just tell him<br/>\nto stay off Tunare where my guys are.  While not any cheaper it would<br/>\nhelp me with the &quot;waste&quot; aspect.  What happens if he is in the game and<br/>\nI try and log in for a quick game?  Will it give me an error, kick him<br/>\nout, suspend the account, alert the Sony SWAT team?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!  Thanks for help with this in advance and for all the help I<br/>\nhave gotten previously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
