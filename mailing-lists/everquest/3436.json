Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br>&nbsp; Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the other<br>&nbsp; parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is there..<br>&nbsp; does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I<br>will<br>&nbsp; hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to<br>zone<br>&nbsp; beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the<br>higher<br>&nbsp; lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br>&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br>&nbsp; luv,<br>&nbsp; -Su<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo!
