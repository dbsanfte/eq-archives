First one if you are coming<br/>\nfrom Gfay run till you get to the buildings (the 2 with vendors) and take a<br/>\nright after the first building and just go straight out there is one there.<br/>\nGoblin Wizards can spawn here and can kill you pretty fast if your not<br/>\ncareful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond one when you come to the next building after the one mentioned before<br/>\nthis (called the cross roads on my server, 2 guards and one dwarf in silver<br/>\nplate Nyzil Xxxxxxxx) go straight past this building and the road will curve<br/>\naround to the left and you will see the goblin huts off to the right after a<br/>\nshort distance on this trail.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird one is when you come to the cross roads guard shack, coming from gfay,<br/>\ntake a right when you get the next guard shack take a left right off the<br/>\ntrail and you will come to another goblin camp (goblin warriors, no wizards<br/>\nhere).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note if you go past the goblin warrior camp you will come to a<br/>\nbandit camp, careful here as the lvl range is large and they have a pretty<br/>\nlarge argo range for their lvl.  I think they can go from 9 to 14 (peg leg<br/>\nis 14 or so).  Spawn is pretty fast.  1 roamer here spawns on the wall<br/>\nacross from the camp and can argo the camp when he runs out to get you.  His<br/>\nname, Qued ( I think).  He is my arch nemesis.  I hate this guy and I think<br/>\nto this day he is still responsible for the majority of my deaths.  I cant<br/>\ncount the number of times I was fighting a goblin or a bat or something and<br/>\nthis SOB came up and started backstabbing me with his fists.  I am sure I<br/>\ndied at least 30 times to this guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nRambled long enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n6 more days to eq<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 19, 2001 4:44 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Cultural Armor costs...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure which one is hte Southeast goblin camp...<br/>\nOh well, I&#39;ll look for it. thanks!<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In Butcher Block....near the southeast  goblin camp...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Am pretty good at Fear Kiting the Young Kodiaks in Commons...<br/>\n&gt; Did a yellow last night :&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;m only a level 9 Druid<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From:      Su [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent:      Saturday, March 17, 2001 6:07 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject:      Re: [EverQuest] Cultural Armor costs...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmm..
