I already had that from EQ... What annoyed me most was the combat system not to mention the smallness of the world, it&#39;s my opinion of course. I&#39;ve beta&#39;d and played each of the other graphical MMORPGs - Asheron&#39;s Call, Anarchy Online, and Camelot. Out of all of them, I had yet to find a combat system where I felt the most freedom to do what I wanted as I do in EQ. With those other ones I always have this strange feeling like my hands are tied, and my feet for that matter. In the design of Everquest, they have almost seamlessly removed the idea that I&#39;m rolling the dice during combat with a mob. Die rolls are still being tossed, yet I still felt I had the most freedom to step out of the dice roll scenario and actually employ tactics of my own choosing. I&#39;m not arguing that EQ is the best at PVP.. The classes are so unbalanced for such type of game, and the combat system of those others leave much to be desired. PVP is best on any number of FPS, for that matter any online card game. :)</p></font><p><br><hr size=\"1\"><b>Do You Yahoo!?</b><br>\nCheck out <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rd.yahoo.com/O=1/I=mail/footer/*http://shopping.yahoo.com\">Yahoo!
