I created a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-967723355\">To coincide with what Melanie is saying, I think it would be more helpful<br/>\nnot so much to make a group chat window but to make a Melee window.  I<br/>\ncreated a second chat box and put it at the top of my screen so its not<br/>\ndirectly in my view.  I used it to filter all melee based messages into it<br/>\nsuch as Others hits, others misses, and so on.  The only melee based<br/>\nmessages I kept in my main window were critical hits, non-melee damage, and<br/>\ndeath messages.  It cuts down considerably on the amount of scroll you see<br/>\nduring a fight.  Particularly if you are not the one fighting.  That way if<br/>\nyou do miss something in group chat you dont have to scroll back so far to<br/>\nsee it.    Just make sure that you set which window you always want to chat<br/>\nto.   You can also set up a smaller window strictly for guild chat as well<br/>\nif you ever get in a guild.    If you&#39;d like, I will take a screenshot of my<br/>\nuser interface and send it to you.  Then you can get some ideas on how other<br/>\npeople have theirs and it might help you figure out your own method.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as a shaman goes, they are the best class for buffs.  Their melee<br/>\nspells are a lot like druids with  and solo very similarly.  The difference<br/>\nis that shamans are barbarians, iksars, etc.;.. races which also make good<br/>\ntanks.  Shamans also get decent pets which grow as you get higher in level.<br/>\nYou can command the pet to fight for you while you sit back and med.  This<br/>\nworks even in groups where you&#39;re the main healer.  It&#39;s an extra tank.  Pet<br/>\nfights, you heal.  Also, shamans are wisdom based casters, so wisdom is<br/>\nstill an improtant stt for you to keep raised.  A suggestion would be to try<br/>\nand equip yourself with armor, weapons, jewelry that has + wis to it.  The<br/>\nhigher your wisdom, the greater your mana pool.  This comes in handy at<br/>\nlater levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I hope that helps.  Shaman is a very cool class for a multitude of<br/>\nreasons.  Not to mention you have the ability to make potions that you can<br/>\nsell for much plat.   You also get SOW 5 levels earlier than druids do, and<br/>\nyou can turn into a bear!  How cool is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nWulfric Rennison   //   Raido Covenfall<br/>\n38 HEF ROG  //  54 ELF DRU<br/>\nCazic Thule Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Melanie Johnson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melanie_6602@...\">melanie_6602@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 19, 2004 9:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] The first time to group blues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; About the group chat thing....<br/>\n&gt; Another thing I do, is create a seperate chat window<br/>\n&gt; just for group chat. Right click on the top of your<br/>\n&gt; chat window where it says Main chat, click new chat<br/>\n&gt; window, then rearrange and resize all your windows<br/>\n&gt; untill you get a setup that you can work with and live<br/>\n&gt; with. I try to keep both my chat boxes at the bottom,<br/>\n&gt; and made a bit smaller so that they both are<br/>\n&gt; side-by-side.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for the shaman advice, I myself have never played<br/>\n&gt; one. But I do know that they are mostly wanted in<br/>\n&gt; groups for their great buffs and their ability to slow<br/>\n&gt; the mob. Also, if you have a cleric in your group,<br/>\n&gt; shaman are great back-up healers.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
