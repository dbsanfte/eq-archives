I play on <br/>\nXegony and have 2 Toons there..Kailerii, Necromancer of the 10th Rank <br/>\nand a Barbarian Bst who is 7th rank. I also have a Bazaar Trader who <br/>\nis Vah-Shir.<br/>\n<br/>\n   My Main, for now anyway, is my DE Necro who is a member of <br/>\nDarkmoon, however since I still enjoy playing both, and have yet to <br/>\ntry any of the other race/class combos I haven&#39;t definitively set Kai <br/>\nas my Main.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In rl I have 2 children (2 and 11) and a wonderful Fiance who has <br/>\npromised to get me the Plat Edition once I get a Toon to 20. I live <br/>\nin NNY about 35 minutes from the Canadian border.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Looking forward to getting to know you and perhaps hunting with <br/>\nsome of you on Xegony..feel free to send a tell if you play that <br/>\nserver..will most likely be on Kailerii for the time being.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                           May your travels keep you safe;<br/>\n                                   Kailerii..DE Necro of the 10th Rank<br/>\n                                    (Sherri)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
