I did, and ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-86196515\">I&#39;ve now got a couple of my characters working on tasks. My 49 ranger was<br/>\nadvised by the task masters to go to Rathe Mountains for a task. I did, and<br/>\neverything was pointing me to Lower Guk. I&#39;ve never really been through<br/>\nUpper and Lower Guk, and going that far underground with a ranger just makes<br/>\nme concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI abandoned the task. The next thing I tried was getting a task from a task<br/>\nmaster in Overthere. It sent me into Burning Woods, where one of the things<br/>\nI had to do was enter the giant fort and scout it out. To accomplish that, I<br/>\ndiscovered I had to run into the middle of the fort. I was invisible, but as<br/>\nsoon as I got within agrro range, I started wailed on by a giant.<br/>\nThankfully, a group was pulling giants from the fort, so it was somewhat<br/>\nabandoned. I trained a giant or two out and ran for the zone line. The next<br/>\nstep is to kill 10 skeletons (can&#39;t remember exactly what type, but I know<br/>\nthey con dark blue -- not sure how well bow-kiting will work in such a busy<br/>\nzone).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrustrated with such difficult and dangerous tasks for my 49 ranger, I tried<br/>\na task with 10 cleric. I was sent into Innothule Swamp from a PoK task<br/>\nmaster and told to kill 10 bull alligators (most con white, some a healthy<br/>\ndark blue). I had to run for my life and died about 10 feet from the PoK<br/>\nbook. I didn&#39;t realize bull alligators helped each other out. I got trounced<br/>\nby two of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m becoming increasingly convinced that tasks are not soloable. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nick Thompson [mailto:poolsharkbc@...]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only place that would give me a task was in the<br/>\nDreadlands, and it sent me ( a 52 Druid) into Chardok<br/>\nfor a recon mission.  Thought it couldn&#39;t be that bad,<br/>\nbut I had never been to Chardok before.  The mission<br/>\nwas to enter the fort inside Chardok and explore the<br/>\narea around the first bridge.  Went in and found the<br/>\nfort (was invised) opened the door, it squeaks and<br/>\nevery mob in Chardok seems to have heard it, and what<br/>\nresulted can only be described as Woodelf paste.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.766 / Virus Database: 513 - Release Date: 17/09/2004</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
