We never did very much, since two poeple in it<br/>\nshared a computer, but alas, it was dibanded for having too few members. I<br/>\nhave thought about joining a guild, but havn&#39;t run into anyone interested in<br/>\ntaking me in, nor have I really advertised that I&#39;m looking for one either.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, when I am not battling the scourge of Norrath, I hang around the<br/>\nQeynos area helping those with less experience than myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamasciss Kyndhart<br/>\nDriud of the 24th Season<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 6<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 12 Jan 2002 14:57:14 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Guild Stolen!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to hear that. The first guild I was in seemed cool at first.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Although<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I should have questioned it a bit more considering they didn&#39;t even ask me<br/>\n&gt; if I wanted to join. I was fighting a battle and an invite popped up. I<br/>\n&gt; clicked NO. Bc it was getting in the way of my fight. It popped up again.<br/>\n&gt; Again I hit NO. Then it popped up again so I clicked YES just to make it<br/>\n&gt; stop popping up. At that point I was so new to the game I really didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; understand what a guild was. Anyways, I made some good friends and was<br/>\n&gt; having fun. But I noticed less and less of my friends were on.. I started<br/>\n&gt; thinking about leaving. But my favorite person in the guild was a guild<br/>\n&gt; officer and I didn&#39;t want to abandon her. Then I ran into my favorite<br/>\n </span></blockquote>person<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in the guild and she was in a different guild. I asked what happened and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>she<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; said that there had been some bickering amongst some of the leading<br/>\n </span></blockquote>members.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She was very nice to me as always. Later on I was still thinking of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>leaving<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but was having fun conversations with the guild leaders. But the very next<br/>\n&gt; day I mentioned my favorite person and that I was sorry she left the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>guild.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They started trashtalking her. I told them that I had really enjoyed the<br/>\n&gt; guild because of her. Then they told me the only reason I was still in the<br/>\n&gt; guild was bc none of the officers were in the same zone with me to disband<br/>\n&gt; me. they started trashtalking me and claimed that I had badmouthed the<br/>\n&gt; guild. What had really happened was someone asked me how I liked the guild<br/>\n&gt; and I said I liked it fine. I said it was cool. I happened to add that I<br/>\n&gt; thought another guild was cool too. I didn&#39;t say it was better or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>anything,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; just that they were both cool. So that person reported to my guildleaders<br/>\n&gt; that I badmouthed the guild. See, I had an alt in the other guild. I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>figured<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bc they are different characters it didnt&#39; really matter. After<br/>\n </span></blockquote>badmouthing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me the guild leaders told me I had a choice: I could leave the guild or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>take<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; my alts out of the other guild. I told them that it was really sad bc we&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; been friends the day before. But they were being so pissy. so I asked them<br/>\n&gt; how I could disband myself from the guild. and I did it right then. I went<br/>\n&gt; straight to the other guild and they invited me in right away.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s sad how guilds can be so fickle.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes, it can happen to you!  A few days ago, my hubby was having fun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with some guildmates when POOF! the guild was no more.  Took some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; figuring out but apparently the person that originally started the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild and was tagged as the &#39;owner&#39; wanted to make a new guild but was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unable because she was still listed as owning Circle of Majik.  She<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had been forced out of the guild about a year ago because of her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thievery and lying.  She was unwelcome with the current leadership of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gawabiwa and could not get control except by force.  She went to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant and had her leader powers reinstated then promptly dropped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everyone out of the guild without any kind of warning.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What a dirty underhanded thing to do!  She didn&#39;t have to drop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everyone! or even anyone!  She could have come in and told everyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before hand, instead she had to yank it out from under us.  It hurt us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the core, but Gawabiwa has built a close knit guild and we are not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our name.  We will rebuild our guild and get ourselves back on track.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  We won&#39;t be having anything to do with whatever guild she has whether<br/>\n&gt; &gt; called Circle of Majik or not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We have lots of support too.
