I went to check them out and you know I have \n    to say I was a little dissapointed in the guides. A lot of the information \n    that they contain can be found at almost any EQ related website! It&#39;s \n    basically that I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay for any of these guides, it&#39;s really \n    not worth the money. The only thing I&#39;m truly interested in is making money. \n    Man&nbsp;it sucks trying to get some decent armor when you have no money. \n    I&#39;ve wondered about the &quot;make Plat at any level&quot; guides and&nbsp;I figured \n    that you would still need to group or partner at some point. </p>\n    <p>Either way I&#39;m having fun just going along and doing things the old \n    fashioned way. I do suggest going and getting these guides because there \n    were a few things in there that was nice to know about but for any player, \n    especially noobs, I suggest doing it the old fashioned way and go out there \n    and take the lumps and partner with some others. It&#39;s funner and you&#39;ll feel \n    better knowing that you did it on your own. </p>\n    <p>I got some good info about Unrest so&nbsp;I think I may go and try it out \n    this week. </p>-- \n    <p>_______________________________________________<br>Sign-up for your own \n    FREE Personalized E-mail at <font color=\"#0000ff\"><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\">Mail.com</a></font></p>\n    <p>&quot;Free price comparison tool gives you the <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestbuyfinder.com/download.htm\">best prices and \n    cash back!</a>&quot;</p><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com/\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n    use of Yahoo!
