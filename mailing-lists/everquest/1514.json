I could not re-boot, turn off the<br/>\nPC, or anything, but had to actually unplug the power cord, wait, and then<br/>\nplug it back in to even get the computer to work. I had to download a bunch<br/>\nof tweaks and drivers from Via, NVidia, Microsoft, etc. (none of the Gateway<br/>\nstock drivers are now on the computer, including the motherboard chipset<br/>\ndriver), and now it works fine, but I was ready to send it back to Gateway<br/>\nat first.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 25, 2001 11:35 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Great EQ Computer?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My dad got an HP with a 1Ghz processor and some type of Nvidia card.<br/>\nNvidia<br/>\n&gt; bought 3dfx so their cards are more likely to be compatible with EQ-- the<br/>\n&gt; later ones that is.<br/>\n&gt; The voodoo 5 works pretty well.
