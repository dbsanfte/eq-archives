They finally just told me they had no clue what was<br/>\nwrong. I don&#39;t mind when they admit to not knowing. But I hate when they act<br/>\nlike I&#39;m too stupid to have tried all the stuff.<br/>\nLike when my modem died and I called my ISP to ask how to get a new one (I<br/>\nrequire a specific modem for satellite that I have to get from a specific<br/>\nsource). 2 hours of repeating myself and explaining things to a tech who<br/>\ntalked to me like I was stupid and I convinced her that my modem really<br/>\n*was* broken. It can be soo annoying sometimes. I was half tempted to tell<br/>\nher that I had worked tech support at the navy and that I wasn&#39;t an idiot so<br/>\nI could tell when a modem was broken.<br/>\nThere must be something in the programming that is overloading dialup...<br/>\nThey really should fix it. It&#39;s unfair to the dialup customers. Telling<br/>\nsomeone to get dsl is bs bc some people can&#39;t get it.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I remember back when I downloaded LoY and I had a dailup connection at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; time and I couldn&#39;t play for more than 5 minutes without the game booting<br/>\n </span></blockquote>me<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; off and having the screen YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED pop up.
