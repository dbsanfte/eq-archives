I <br/>\nhad a gnoll hide whip I used for some 1hs, and I have a velium <br/>\nmorning star for 1hb. My plan is to use both for a while when I get <br/>\ndual wield. Use the whip primary for fast lashing and possible stun, <br/>\nand the star in the off-hand for dealing bigger damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nBartoo<br/>\nHalfling Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Rob LeBeau &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Ok, I have a level 11 warrior and would like your<br/>\n&gt; opinion on the following:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I started wondering why I was not hitting that much<br/>\n&gt; with him even though he has a good weapon. After some<br/>\n&gt; research, I found that the reason I am not hitting as<br/>\n&gt; much as others is because I have been switching<br/>\n&gt; between 2HS and 1HS weapons to increase the skills of<br/>\n&gt; each attribute.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Example: My skill in both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br/>\n&gt; attack is at like 152.  If I were to just use 1HS<br/>\n&gt; let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have proved this because now that I am using the 1HS<br/>\n&gt; more, the skill is close to 30 and my ATK rating is<br/>\n&gt; close to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is still at<br/>\n&gt; 152.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Would you continue to alternate both weapon types or<br/>\n&gt; would you just pick one and go with it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; THanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Sign up for SBC Yahoo!
