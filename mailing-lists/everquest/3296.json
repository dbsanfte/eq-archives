This sounds like a good<br/>\nidea but you are actually saying another real account<br/>\nfor just baking?  Who shells out the REAL dollars for<br/>\nthat account?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the topic of having a friend log in with your<br/>\naccount for this does make sense, regardless of who<br/>\npays for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine being on line when some guildee says&quot;<br/>\n/Guild, &quot;I need to donate 200PP to the banker, please<br/>\nlet me know where we can meet?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL<br/>\n<br/>\nBanker replies, /Guild &quot;Ok, I will stop huting with<br/>\nthe group, Be right there.&quot;.......NOT<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Point Alex.<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alexander.jones@...\">alexander.jones@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ive got a question for the list. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Its around the account is personal and cant be<br/>\n&gt; exchanged with outhers bla<br/>\n&gt; bla. I do agree very much that you shall keep your<br/>\n&gt; account safe and all<br/>\n&gt; this, but in a large scale operations guild its<br/>\n&gt; IMPOSSIBLE to not share your<br/>\n&gt; account with a few people that you trust. This is<br/>\n&gt; essential to day to day<br/>\n&gt; operations. You choose a couple of people who you<br/>\n&gt; trust and hand them your<br/>\n&gt; info.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1 example. Guild property and funding. A single<br/>\n&gt; person cannot manage the<br/>\n&gt; trades/funds/hand out of items for the guild. This<br/>\n&gt; would be a full time job<br/>\n&gt; for 1 person in my guild. Our solution is a separate<br/>\n&gt; account shared among<br/>\n&gt; the officers with mules for cash / gems / spells /<br/>\n&gt; items. On our<br/>\n&gt; messageboard transactions take place and a member<br/>\n&gt; can ask any officer to<br/>\n&gt; complete a transaction once its validated on board.<br/>\n&gt; This is clearly against<br/>\n&gt; the EULA but since there are no support for these<br/>\n&gt; types of operations with a<br/>\n&gt; central store for a guild we have not found a better<br/>\n&gt; way to handle work like<br/>\n&gt; this. How do others solve these types of problems?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, July 19, 2002 5:32 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Digest Number 531<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, any exchange of accounts is forbidden by the<br/>\n&gt; terms of service. Part of<br/>\n&gt; the reason for this is that the person buying the<br/>\n&gt; account may get swindled.<br/>\n&gt; They may pay for the account only to find that the<br/>\n&gt; character is deleted or<br/>\n&gt; the person changes passwords on them and so forth.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard of this<br/>\n&gt; happening. Or they may get an account that has many<br/>\n&gt; soulmarks for bad<br/>\n&gt; behavior. Also, people who work for Verant and EQ<br/>\n&gt; have been invited to this<br/>\n&gt; list. If they see the people advertising they are<br/>\n&gt; selling their accounts<br/>\n&gt; here, they may bust the person who is trying to sell<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since he is selling his account for Platnum (15k,<br/>\n&gt; which I don&#39;t have) is<br/>\n&gt; that against the rules?
