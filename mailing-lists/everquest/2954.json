I don&#39;t really know what the various numbers mean, but as <br/>\nyour bar goes red and shrinks, you may expect to be disconnected. <br/>\nThis may be at the game server or your internet connection. When you <br/>\nare disconnected you go &quot;link dead.&quot; Inconvenient most of the time, <br/>\ndeadly if you are in battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are in a critical situation and your bar keeps going red then <br/>\nback to green, it is often wise to move somewhere safe until the lag <br/>\nproblem goes away. The better your system the less lag you get on <br/>\nyour end, but there are still connection and server issues which will <br/>\ngive you some lag.
