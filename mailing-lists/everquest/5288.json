I have a 13 Iksar Monk<br/>\nbut have been playing my 5 Wood Elf Ranger lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ranger has a quiver that he keeps his arrows in.  I saw a tip when I<br/>\nlogged on that says keeping arrows in a quiver decreases attack time.  I can<br/>\nnot get him to draw from his quiver.  The only arrows he uses are in the<br/>\nammo slot.  The quiver will not fit in the ammo slot.  If I have no arrows<br/>\nin the ammo slot I get a message &quot;Out Of Ammunition&quot; when I try and use my<br/>\nbow, even with my quiver full.  I have tried putting the quiver on my back<br/>\nand it won&#39;t fit there either.  I have asked a bunch of people in game with<br/>\nno luck, searched the web and looked in my hint book.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile on the subject of archers, my bow and arrows each have a range and<br/>\ndamage rating.  My bow is Range 75 Damage 8 (I think).  My arrows are Range<br/>\n25 Damage 1.  What is my range and damage?  100 and 9 by adding the numbers,<br/>\n25 and 1 taking the lower of each?  Something else?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
