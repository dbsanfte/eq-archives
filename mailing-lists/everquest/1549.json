If it were truly a<br/>\nroleplaying<br/>\n    game, this would not even be an issue.  If your main drive in the game<br/>\nis<br/>\n    to get the bigger and better item (whatever it may be), you will always<br/>\n    have low level players trying to be twinked and you will always have<br/>\n    jealous &quot;un-twinked&quot; players.  But when did the term &quot;roleplaying game&quot;<br/>\n    turn into &quot;hack and loot&quot;? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
