Very few hunting <br/>\nthere, so lots of wandering Gnolls to pick off. That happens when the <br/>\nGnoll hunters are not many at the spires, some gnolls wander off.<br/>\nIf the spire camps are busy, but the groups are not large enough to <br/>\ntake every gnoll that pops, a tracker can locate wanderers and pick <br/>\nup a gnoll or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so, learning that none had fs for sale, I went to the area near <br/>\nthe hermit. Sure enough, I picked up a wandering gnoll right away. He <br/>\ndropped a fs warhammer, which I took home to Rivervale. I broke it <br/>\ninto ore, and made my hq metal bits. Grabbed the parts, went to the <br/>\nVale forge, and gave it a shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI now have my Vale Sewing Kit. Pretty exciting. I will have to head <br/>\nout for Velious soon to start gathering the pieces for the Halfling <br/>\n100% weight reduction bags. Should be some big coin in those.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
