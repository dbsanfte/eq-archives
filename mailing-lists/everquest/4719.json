I&#39;m getting really tired of using<br/>\nmy training points on Elder Erudite, Gnoll and other<br/>\nlanguages I doubt I&#39;ll ever use, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The only problem I see with being charged to train<br/>\n&gt; is that you end up with a lot of  excess training<br/>\n&gt; points you can&#39;t use.  You get 5 training points<br/>\n&gt; each level you go up.  However, you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; necessarily get 5 new skills each level so if you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; like me, you put one point into the new skill to get<br/>\n&gt; it started then let the course of the game and use<br/>\n&gt; of that skill cause it to go up.  Of course after a<br/>\n&gt; certain point you get charged plat for training, not<br/>\n&gt; to mention the training point.  Well I don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt; the training points but I can&#39;t spend them on<br/>\n&gt; anything else.  So I find it&#39;s a waste of plat to<br/>\n&gt; have to pay for training.   But what can ya do? <br/>\n&gt; They should have some kind of reward process<br/>\n&gt; implemented where you can convert your non-used<br/>\n&gt; training points into AA points or back into plat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; From: hoggtyed <br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 11, 2003 6:20 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Training Points and<br/>\n&gt; Platinum<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      OK, You can train your trade skills ( baking,<br/>\n&gt; Tailoring, ect) To <br/>\n&gt; 21 and after a few free points it does start<br/>\n&gt; charging. Languages and <br/>\n&gt; other skills like 1 hb 2 hb and slashing can be<br/>\n&gt; trained way on past <br/>\n&gt; 21 at your trainer depending on your level.  My<br/>\n&gt; druid has always used <br/>\n&gt; a 1hb When I decided to het a scimitar at lv 48 I<br/>\n&gt; trained as high as <br/>\n&gt; I could and it was costing several plat a point  I<br/>\n&gt; paid over a <br/>\n&gt; hundred to gain skill level at trainer.  <br/>\n&gt;     I have been on almost 4 years and it has been<br/>\n&gt; this way the entire <br/>\n&gt; time I have  played. I beleive the reason trade<br/>\n&gt; skills are capped at <br/>\n&gt; 21 is to create player based economy for and to<br/>\n&gt; reward those willing <br/>\n&gt; to go out and put the work in something.<br/>\n&gt;                   My 2 copper,<br/>\n&gt;                               Hogg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\nNever confuse your right to do something<br/>\nwith the right thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
