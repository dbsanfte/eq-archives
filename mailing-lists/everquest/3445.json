Kinda<br/>\nreminds me of the time I first went on a guild raid to Lguk and fell off the<br/>\nnarrow boards and was immediately agroed by the mobs and it took over 4<br/>\nhours for them to find my corpse lol and I was bound  umm in all places<br/>\nNeriak heh had been bound there since I was born and I was a level 23 atm<br/>\nlol<br/>\n<br/>\nbut the secret  of course when going up some of the icy ones is to look<br/>\nwalk with sow off  follow someone who has been there before and  who can<br/>\nshow you  exactly where to step etc.  It took me only  one fall and  2 trips<br/>\ngetting form the zone entrance in GD to the upper area  to the Tents to<br/>\nlearn how to get up that far safely. getting out though was the bad part<br/>\ncause part of the way you cant get out the same way you got in lol so I<br/>\nwound up doing the ninja  zone where I faced a certain wall in the pit<br/>\ninvised so not to get agro  ran into the wall and camped out came back<br/>\ncamped out again and was back at zone entrance to GD.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the crowding yeah we get that on  the Saryn server as of late as<br/>\nwell.  Our Raid coordinator for my guild  got a bunch of us together   and<br/>\nhad us camp there and  each of us would play an alt and he would join<br/>\nwhatever group was at the tents and let us know in raid chat what class was<br/>\nleaving and to have the corresponding guildy log on that char  in Velks and<br/>\nfill in the slot till we had all guildies in the group lol.  we spent a<br/>\nwhole weekend doing this and we eventually had it to where  except for once<br/>\nor twice we had nothing but guildies  at the tents in Velks<br/>\n<br/>\nCynfyn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Velks is good. I don&#39;t like going up high there. I made it to 51 and 52 in<br/>\n&gt; Velks. But lately it&#39;s been too crowded and I haven&#39;t been able to find a<br/>\n&gt; group.<br/>\n&gt; Im not familiar with the tent. I do the floor where you come in either in<br/>\n&gt; one of the side rooms or on the middle room in the back. I&#39;ve sometimes<br/>\ngone<br/>\n&gt; up to SH. I really hate going up those narrow passageways though.<br/>\nespecially<br/>\n&gt; with the slippery ice.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
