I have seen the gforce 2<br/>\n&gt; for about $45. I am wondering if I can expect much improved<br/>\n&gt; performance with the gforce 2. Both are pci, both 32k. I get lots of<br/>\n&gt; lag in Rivervale, most of Luclin, and some of the other cities. Not<br/>\n&gt; everywhere, just where lots of people gather and the backgrounds are<br/>\n&gt; graphics intensive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm.. I have a GEForce 2 MX 64.

Compare that to www.pricewatch.com as well.<br/>\nOh, and if you want a product review, you can also try www.epinions.com<br/>\nI found those 3 very useful in finding myself a new modem and sound card.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would want a very obvious improvement to even bother with the<br/>\n&gt; upgrade on the graphics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think one of those websites listed lets you compare two of the products...<br/>\nso you can look for your current one and compare it with a potential card.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
