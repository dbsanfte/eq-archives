Druids are always in demand \n  -- &quot;sow please.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>Heh. You&#39;ll be lucky if you get a &quot;please&quot;. I&#39;ve \n  found people just say &quot;can<br>I have sow&quot;. (now that my druid is able to sow). \n  I had one guy come up and<br>bug me when I was turning in CB belts in Kaladim \n  yesterday. He said &quot;can I<br>have sow.&quot; I said &quot;I can&#39;t cast that spell \n  indoors&quot;. guy says &quot;What are you<br>giving him?&quot; me: &quot;Crushbone belts&quot; guy \n  &quot;Can I have sow.&quot;<br>So I tried to cast it on him just to show it wouldn&#39;t \n  work. then I told him<br>the message. I was just about to camp. He&#39;s like &quot;ok. \n  tell me when you&#39;re<br>leaving so you can sow me.&quot;<br>I was thinking &quot;would it \n  kill the person to ask if I could go out and sow<br>him? or to say please?&quot; \n  That has been bothering me lately. Lack of manners.<br>I&#39;ve been casting sow \n  on people before they can ask for it lately. they hail<br>me and I cast it. \n  Just so I won&#39;t have to be angry if they don&#39;t say please.<br>Most of them say \n  thanks at least.<br>anyhoo, I just camped right there and never said another \n  word to the person.<br>I was too tired to deal with \n  it.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
