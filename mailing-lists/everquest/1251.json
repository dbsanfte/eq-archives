I either decide that the experience is worth it and miss out <br/>\non looting, or I quit the group and look for another.  The tanks <br/>\nwon&#39;t appreciate what you bring to the group until you are gone.  <br/>\nAlso, while there are more of the type looter you describe in the <br/>\ngame, there are many who strive to be fair and succeed.  Perhaps you <br/>\nshould choose your friends more wisely...  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cp worth...<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few <br/>\nproblems with<br/>\n&gt; loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play <br/>\nthe main<br/>\n&gt; healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I <br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to <br/>\nestablish alpha<br/>\n&gt; loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All <br/>\nthey care<br/>\n&gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>\n&gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else <br/>\ngets a<br/>\n&gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people <br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>\n&gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of <br/>\nloot.<br/>\n&gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and <br/>\nhe was a<br/>\n&gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that <br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an <br/>\nexpensive<br/>\n&gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he <br/>\npicked up a<br/>\n&gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, <br/>\nthat&#39;s only<br/>\n&gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>\n&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>\n&gt; Just wondering.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well <br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; people cooperate. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
