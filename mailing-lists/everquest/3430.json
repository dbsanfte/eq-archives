Anyone have tips or info about the<br/>\nlayout of that place?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI find the best places for xp as a dark, bearing in mind I have limited<br/>\nchoices on a pvp server so I probably miss out on some of the best haunts,<br/>\nat 52 is Skyfire Mountains and Chardok both on Kunark. Also Sol B on the<br/>\nmainland is still good there if you can get a beetle group or maybe even a<br/>\nfire giant group there. The Hole on Odus and Cobalt Scar on Velious would<br/>\nalso be good exp at that level I think.<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Su<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, July 28, 2002 5:38 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [EverQuest] Hunting grounds for 50+<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place to hunt<br/>\nto<br/>\n  get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>\n  Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the other<br/>\n  parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is there..<br/>\n  does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I<br/>\nwill<br/>\n  hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to<br/>\nzone<br/>\n  beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the<br/>\nhigher<br/>\n  lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>\n  Any suggestions?<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
