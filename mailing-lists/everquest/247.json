On average it was about a 3 sec more load time.<br/>\n<br/>\n The times also didn&#39;t change when zoning into an area with<br/>\na lot of merchants vs very few or none. But # of NPC (non merchants) can<br/>\nbe a factor too. <br/>\n<br/>\n The HD&#39;s on both machines lit up for the same amount of time (2-3 sec)<br/>\nbetween zoning. <br/>\n<br/>\n Tests were done both in Day and Night EQ time. In case vid rendering <br/>\nplayed any factors.<br/>\n<br/>\nConclusion:<br/>\n  I did a few more series of experimenting, but it seems<br/>\nto boil down to Processor speed; at least for me.  I&#39;ve read some posts<br/>\nthat are almost opposite of my findings, however, it wasn&#39;t mentioned<br/>\nif it was the same zone or the player loads on that zone they were <br/>\ncomparing it to.  e.g. comparing zone times of someone going from<br/>\nsouth Qeynos city to north gets a 10sec load, to someone in Freeport <br/>\ngoing to east or west freeport getting 15 sec loads may not be a fair<br/>\ncomparison.  <br/>\n  I also noticed that the Character will show up on the other side<br/>\nof the zone (as observed by another player) but my screen still show<br/>\nit still loading.  This seems to indicate that there is some procssing<br/>\nstill being done on the Client side even though the character has <br/>\nalready been loaded into the new zone.  This was also verified when<br/>\nI died (in the same zone I respawn in), I respawned or rather my Screen<br/>\nunfroze right before I got a death blow from some Orc that just happend<br/>\nto be camping on my spawning point. =)  This tells me that my character<br/>\nwas active on the server, but my machine was still procssing info before<br/>\nit could unfreeze my screen.   On my Pent II machine, my character <br/>\nappearing and my screen unfreezing seem to lag by 2-3 seconds. <br/>\n  I did play via 56k v90 modem on my Pent II a few times and noticed no<br/>\nreal difference on load times.  I did notice teleporting chars/mobs and<br/>\nhad higher ping and packetloss ( &gt;400 ping, 3-8% packetloss).<br/>\n<br/>\nDisclaimer: All this is just my quick experimentation to see if my<br/>\nAMD was worth using to play EQ on (Just set it up a few days ago). There<br/>\nmay be other factors that can disprove all of this.  In anycase it was<br/>\nmy personal testing i thought i&#39;d share with the List.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my few coppers...<br/>\n  //Aldaren the &quot;zoning&quot; Cleric  of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
