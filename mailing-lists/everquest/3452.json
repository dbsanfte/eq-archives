I don&#39;t think they<br/>\nhave that many hitpoints either and only get duel wield. Seems like a good<br/>\nclass to solo or partner with though if you aren&#39;t into raiding. You<br/>\nbasically get either two tanks or a tank and a healer depending on how you<br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard they get a couple of group spells, one increases mana and life regen<br/>\nand the other increases stats and resistances.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alexander.jones@...\">alexander.jones@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2002 5:12 AM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [EverQuest] The Beastlord<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  The beastlord is sadly untuned yet. As for pet beeing the tank in a group,<br/>\nhmm nope. Pets cant tank shit if you have any other melee in group, the cant<br/>\nhold aggro besides the fact that pathing can really screw things up.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The beastlord himself tanks pretty good and the petheals are excellent.<br/>\nBut the class brings very little to the raiding world and very few play them </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
