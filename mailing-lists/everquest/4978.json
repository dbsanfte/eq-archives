Like say if you were a ogre warrior and you didn&#39;t like the way<br/>\nyour helmet looked like, well you could go down to a forge or blacksmith and<br/>\npay a certain amount to have them mold the helmet anyway you would<br/>\nlike..maybe you would like horns on the helmet or a certain design ecthed on<br/>\nit..and for casters you could go to a tailor somewhere and have them design<br/>\nyour robe a certain way..maybe you would like longer sleeves or a slit in<br/>\nyour robe or a fancy collar. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
