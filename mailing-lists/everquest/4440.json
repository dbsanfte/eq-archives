(no, i didn&#39;t sold the<br/>\nMQ, i have enough ALTs and friends to serve :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nin OOT you really can camp the AC: random spawn<br/>\nat a static spawn point. people are very serious<br/>\nabout not KSing there. the main problems are<br/>\n(a) getting the camp, (b) getting ultra bored<br/>\nhaving the camp. location is on the isle with<br/>\nthe spell merchant. the AC has a pirate and a<br/>\ntroll on the same spawn cycle. it took me about<br/>\n8 hours to get an AC ring there.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe AC in OOT is a bit tougher as its cousin<br/>\nin SR: 40+-1 compared to 36+-1. but i am not<br/>\nreally sure about the levels. when i first<br/>\nsuccessfully hit the AC, bilt was 46.<br/>\n<br/>\nstep (2): i like to hunt shadow men in west<br/>\ncommons. but any place is good. the stupid<br/>\nthing about shadow men drop(ping)s: almost<br/>\nall of them are NO RENT. also it isn&#39;t easy<br/>\nto spot them. it is possible to &quot;see&quot; if a<br/>\nshadow men wields a shadow rapier. drop rate<br/>\nis strange: it took about 3 hours to get one<br/>\nonce... but must of the time, you can get<br/>\none in 30mins to 1 hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nlast part (3): ok, now you have to give Hasten<br/>\n(gnome, very fast, imho faster than jboots)<br/>\n3250gp. i also tried it with 325pp and it<br/>\nworked for me, but i also have gold on another<br/>\nchar if it should fail. when you have the<br/>\nAC ring, you really don&#39;t care about the money<br/>\nanymore, you just don&#39;t want to loose the<br/>\nring!<br/>\n<br/>\nthe &quot;biggest&quot; problem is to find Hasten:<br/>\n - he is on a cycle with a drake and a lvl 60<br/>\n   brother (brother is needed by monk epic)<br/>\n - their &quot;normal&quot; lifetime is four hours<br/>\n - their respawn time is 28 minutes<br/>\n - the three have a very long route they will<br/>\n   follow<br/>\n - Hasten runs very fast<br/>\n - Hasten is small (gnome)<br/>\n<br/>\nif you don&#39;t know the route of those three, you<br/>\nwill need a tracker. many will help you there<br/>\n(many druids are there farming the poor HGs).<br/>\nif Hasten is up, someone has to stop him by<br/>\nhailing him... and keep hailing him, until the<br/>\nperson doing the quest gets there. hand in the<br/>\nitems, with the person to get the jboots being<br/>\nthe last one to hit OK in the trade window.<br/>\n<br/>\nif Hasten isn&#39;t up, check if the brother is up.<br/>\nyou only have a few choices then:<br/>\n - kill him... not so easy for most chars<br/>\n - wait for him to despawn<br/>\n<br/>\nif the drake is up, kill it (i don&#39;t know the<br/>\nlevel, but it is very low), wait for 28 minutes<br/>\nand check the spawns again.<br/>\n<br/>\nafter on of the three is killed, it is randomed<br/>\nwhich one will spawn after 28 minutes. the chances<br/>\nare drake - hasten - brother, eg a drake will<br/>\nrespawn more often than hasten.<br/>\n<br/>\none more word about it: i won&#39;t go into more detail!<br/>\ni know how _i_ will do it and everyone has to find<br/>\nher/his own way doing the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck<br/>\n  - bilt<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik, lvl 57 gnome magician, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
