I live in sweden and<br/>\npreordered the game about one week before the end of beta phase 4, now I<br/>\nhave ordered it from 4 places both domestic(one being the largest comp.<br/>\ngame distributor in sweden) and foreign. But I still haven&#39;t received the<br/>\ngame. Now I am active reader on eqvault as well as participate in mailing<br/>\nlists, and this is REALLY annoying. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve had some extra<br/>\ntime thinking about what class/race I will play.. And if I don&#39;t get the<br/>\ngame within 2 weeks from now I&#39;m gonna give up and buy Ultima or<br/>\nsomething, but then again, I would have to kill myself.. :p<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron - Totally BUMMED right now! :(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
