Even as SOEs major flagship game, SOE is seeing<br/>\nthe darkness at the end of the tunnel.  They will be spending more money<br/>\nto maintain the game than they are bringing in with subscriptions<br/>\ndropping more and more each month.  I think SOE &quot;may&quot; <br/>\ntry to revitilize EQ by releasing a completely new graphics engine and<br/>\nserious upgrade for the game, but this would be optional and only be<br/>\nwindow dressing since there is not too much they can do with the backend<br/>\nservers without a complete game overhaul, which they just are not going<br/>\nto do.  EQ2 was a serious disapointment to them, as the players were<br/>\nalready use to EQ1 and the social structure there.  It does sadden me a<br/>\nbit that EQ will come to a close, but we all knew it would happen<br/>\neventually.  I doubt SOE will ever cancel EQ completely (at least not<br/>\nfor another 5 or so years), but I would imagine the day when new<br/>\nexpansion are no longer released, patches are no longer made, and maybe<br/>\none or two servers are all that are left is not too far around the<br/>\ncorner.... like I said, maybe 2 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt there will ever be another game that has the same appeal and<br/>\ndrive that SOE captured with EQ1... however I think we might find that<br/>\nanother game may come close only after SOE &quot;pulls the plug&quot; on<br/>\nEQ1 and forces everyone to find another game.  We may see a game in the<br/>\nfuture released from SOE along the same genre of EverQuest, but with a<br/>\ncompletely different story line and perhaps even the same stayability of<br/>\nEverQuest, but I rather doubt it.  I think SOE will end up making their<br/>\nbread and butter with shoot-offs of the Star Wars Universe and maybe<br/>\nsome other games like they offer on the station website (jeopardy, wheel<br/>\nof fortune, etc), while another game company with the same spirit that<br/>\nSOE had long ago steps up to take the lead.  I would say the next big<br/>\ngame will be Vanguard : Saga of Heros.  I think that Brad and Jeff have<br/>\nboth learned a lot from their experience helping shape EverQuest, and<br/>\nMicrosoft (one of the biggest backers of Sigil) has learned from its<br/>\nmistakes in the online game field and won&#39;t make the same mistakes<br/>\nagain.  SOE has started loosing its grip on the market and Microsoft has<br/>\na habit of stepping in and taking over when something like that happens.<br/>\nI mean look at Nintendo, Sega, and even Sony.  They started slipping in<br/>\nthe console game industry and Microsoft stepped in with the X-Box and<br/>\ndominated the market by throwing money at the market till they owned it.<br/>\nNow the best graphics for console games out there are on X-Box, even if<br/>\ncontent is still split evenly but leaning more towards X-Box as time<br/>\ngoes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\naka Dragowulf Bowcraft (Ranger of The Tribunal) Dulcere the Furryfooted<br/>\nRanger (Retired Guide of Erollisi Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Oh cool!!<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though.
