Helm: Thomas(Qeynos based) - 2","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-91842129\">I now have full confirmation on what you need to do to get the paladin armor called armor of ro, the replacement for rubicite..<br/>\n<br/>\nHelm: Thomas(Qeynos based) - 2 Skulls looted off Undead Cyclops in Karana (not known which one).<br/>\n<br/>\nGauntlets: Joanna(Freeport based) - Locket from Grimtooth, a rare spawn Werewolf in North karana.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreastplate: Abigail(Felwithe based) - 2 Dark Cauldrons off Ancille Cooks in Mistmoore Castle(cauldrons are nodrop).<br/>\n<br/>\nVambraces: Marianna(Qeynos based) - 2 Rotten Shark Portions from Plague Sharks near Qeynos Hills.<br/>\n<br/>\nBracers: David(Erudin based) - 2 Goblin Nets from Goblin Net Masters in Lake Rathe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoots: Nicholas(Kaladim based) - Random loot from low level rare spawn Sand Giant in South Ro, turn in Brass Brazen Kilij PLANS.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreaves: Elisabeth(Freeport based) - nightfall giant head from nightfall giants in west commons, spawns around 8pm, but not every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have one of the pieces for one of the armor, turn it on to respective person to get a mold. Then you must go to the temple of solusek ro and talk to a Lord something(I forget:) dwarf there, say &quot;I need ronium&quot; and he will respond. Then he will mention ronium bars and say the things in the brackets, you need amiable faction to be able to proceed here.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get faction with temple of solusek I suggest you fill your pockets with 200g or something, travel down to south ro and find the small camp in the northwest corner(very close to zone from oasis), there is an erudite there, give him 5 gold at a time for faction raise with the temple of solusek(faction with shadowmen will drop, but who cares;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your faction is good enough here, the dwarf will give you a cauldron(6 slots and a combine button) and tell you what you need to put in it, he also mentions you have to be a master blacksmith to be able to successfully combine the ingredients into ronium.<br/>\n<br/>\nRonium Ingredients:<br/>\n<br/>\nMelatite - Kill Clockworks, Solusek A(screws up faction with akanon)<br/>\n<br/>\n2 Enchanted Bars of Platinum(will cost you 210p if you don&#39;t have to pay someone to enchant them)<br/>\n<br/>\nMistmoore Granite - Leering and Jeering Gargoyles in Mistmoore castle(nodrop so you have to get them yourself)<br/>\n<br/>\nSands of Ro - Random loot from Sand Giants, go to oasis.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoil of Underfoot - Quest in Kaladim, Priestess Chalea wants 4 Faery dusts(from Faeries in Lesser Faydark Faery camp, this also requires very good faction with the cleric guild in kaladim)<br/>\n<br/>\nPut all 6 items in the cauldron, make sure you are a master blacksmith, and pray not to fail. You have to do this for EACH of the armor pieces of ro.<br/>\n<br/>\nConclusion:<br/>\nIf compared to the other classes quests, like warriors crafted and bards lambent and rangers ivy etched, the paladin quests are about 4 times as hard as the others, here are the reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) For each quest to get the molds you need to spend time to get very good with a faction, no two items requires the same faction either.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) You have to get so many items for the metal ronium, kill SG&#39;s, do side quests etc, compared to for example bards, that only needs to get a lambent stone and 2 rubies to make lambent gem, an NPC makes it for them too, and warriors only needs the quest item and a gem, but paladins need 4 items AND 2 expensive platinum bars. Now read the next chocking conclusion in point 3, if you haven&#39;t guessed already...<br/>\n<br/>\n3) A paladin has to become a MASTER BLACKSMITH to forge the armor, and since the finished armor is NODROP you cannot get a smith friend to do it for you, ranger, bard and warrior armor is NOT nodrop btw.. So you cannot sell the armor when you upgrade to PoF valorium or something either.. Personally I never tried blacksmithing because everyone else was at the time, and all the clicking of items mad my fingers sore anwyay hehe, so to me this means I have to pick up a skill I left at 25 half a year ago to create armor that nobody buys anymore to get smithing up to master level(120 or so I believe), gee, I wonder how many thousands of pp this will cost not to mention the weeks of time.. This is in my eyes the most severe imbalance in the paladin quests..<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The stats.. I have only seen stats on the greaves, ac 11 STA +6 and +10 SV_DISEASE, comparable to 10 ac on steel plate, and the bard lambent greaves which are ac 13, AGI +5 and CHA +3(don&#39;t know about you but I think the bard greaves are much better).. I may jump to conclusions when it comes to stats because I do not have info on all the pieces to compare, maybe another paladin piece is alot better than the bards, we&#39;ll see..<br/>\n<br/>\nThis leads us to point 5..<br/>\n<br/>\n5) The looks.. The armor of ro is the same color as steel plate, although I have heard rumors that the boots, bracers and gauntlets are yellow, which means not only do we get armor with a very common color that does not set it apart from normal steel plate, but the whole set is not even the same color! To me, being a roleplayer, looks is very important and personally I think this is a load of crap, shame on you Verant! :(<br/>\n<br/>\nConclusion:<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot really say yet, but I think that since this armor is replacement for rubicite, all the classes should get EQUALLY hard quests. A guid said to me when I spoke to him that &quot;nobody said playing a paladin would be easy&quot;, well I can reply with &quot;Nobody said it would be hard either, and when I made my character it said LOW to MODERATE difficulty&quot;..<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I also understand SKs are pretty much in the same situation as paladins with their armor, but I have no information about their armor or their quests whatsoever so I cannot comment on this unfortunately, maybe someone knows more?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron - *is hoping Verant patches this and at least puts in an NPC to do the blacksmithing part*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
