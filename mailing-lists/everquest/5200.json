Bards are <br/>\nvery good charecters, and can be a great asset to any group, but <br/>\nthey are also among the hardest chars to masters in the game as it <br/>\nrequires some decent skill to get down what is refered to <br/>\nas &quot;twisting&quot; or playing multiple songs virtually at the same time <br/>\nto help your group.  This takes a good amount of dexterity on your <br/>\nkeyboard and getting timing down just right while also moving and <br/>\ndoing normal stuff in EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice would be to start with a simpler char until you get down <br/>\nthe basic commands and movements.  No offense to anyone here, but <br/>\nmaking a human warrior would be the best charecter to start with <br/>\nwhen learning EQ.  It is a simple hack and slash char in the early <br/>\nlevels and gives you time to learn a bit.  Again, don&#39;t get me wrong <br/>\nanyone, warriors are some of the hardest chars to play in the end <br/>\ngame because you have to worry about holding aggro and working with <br/>\nall the other classes, but like I said, early on they are the <br/>\neasiest to learn the game with.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrago<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;amberdunham2000&quot; <br/>\n&lt;amberdunham2000@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; hi,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just going to be starting eq.
