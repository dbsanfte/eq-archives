I got my<br/>\ncleric from 44 to 51. :)<br/>\nThe zone to CC is a thing you click on inside the Rygor orc fort in EW. you<br/>\nneed camo/invis to get inside. The rygor orcs run with sow so they can<br/>\neasily chase you down. and they stun. Very very nasty critters.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does one get to Crystal Caverns? I have always wanted to go but dont<br/>\nknow hw to get there. I am a 36 ranger can I play there?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: erik<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, April 16, 2002 7:48 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Couple of questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; From: &quot;Jerry M. Banks&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:y2kansas@...\">y2kansas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I just hit level 30 last night, and being the Druid that I am, I had a<br/>\n  &gt; couple of questions.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; First, I&#39;ve been hunting in South Karana since level 25, hunting the<br/>\nTesch<br/>\n  &gt; Mas Gnolls around Paw, and perhaps have become a little spoiled, as I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n  &gt; been getting great experience killing the yellows and whites, and<br/>\nreaping<br/>\n  &gt; the rewards of the loot. Now, having reached level 30, all of the gnolls<br/>\n  are<br/>\n  &gt; now nearing the point where hunting them isn&#39;t beneficial. Could someone<br/>\n  &gt; suggest a similar zone/area with good experience and average to good<br/>\nloot<br/>\n  &gt; where I could hunt fairly safely, either in a group or solo?<br/>\n<br/>\n  You can try going inside Paw (I was actually hunting in Paw from 25 to<br/>\nabout<br/>\n  30, altough you can hunt in Paw longer than that).<br/>\n<br/>\n  After that, I went to RM to hunt HGs and spent some time in Crystal<br/>\nCaverns.<br/>\n  I basically did 30-40 in RM, CC, OT and Eastern Wastes (with a couple<br/>\n  unsuccessful trips to Tower of the Frozen Shadow).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would make sure that you get as much experience dungeons as you can<br/>\n  though.  LGuk and SolB (along with CC) are good places to try to find a<br/>\n  group.  I did some hunting in SolA at 30, but you really need to go deep<br/>\nto<br/>\n  get good XP there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sulamwen<br/>\n  Half Elf Pathfinder<br/>\n  E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
