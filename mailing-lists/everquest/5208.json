My main character is a 30th level ranger on the Tarew Marr server,<br/>\nand I&#39;ve soloing the sarnak fort for the last few levels (since about<br/>\n24th)...so all in all, probably about a month&#39;s worth of play time for me.<br/>\nFor the most part, the fort has been really quiet. More often than not, I&#39;m<br/>\nthe only one fighting there, but over the last few days, the sarnak fort has<br/>\nbecome an extremely popular spot for some reason and the place is now<br/>\novercamped with groups that end up fighting over the sarnaks that spawn<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m trying to figure out where to take my ranger next for when I&#39;m<br/>\nsoloing. When I&#39;m in a group, I have a number of places to go, but I can&#39;t<br/>\nfigure out what my next step should be for soloing. Would anybody care to<br/>\nshare some suggestions, please?<br/>\n<br/>\nChris</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
