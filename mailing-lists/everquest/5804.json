I just picked up the Platinum pack, installed it and <br/>\ndouble clicked on the exe icon. The game starts to load, goes throught <br/>\nthe download screen and then I get an error that eqgame.exe has <br/>\ngenerated errors and I will need to restart the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nTi&#39;s been a while since I played and have decided to get back into it <br/>\nhowever I can&#39;t seem to get it going. so the first question I have is <br/>\nwhere does the error log go to? I want to view it and see if it tells me <br/>\nwhat the problem is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have shut off Norton, set Zone Alarm to &quot;low&quot; and turned orr port <br/>\nblocker. Can anyone else think of something that may be the cause?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nSteve</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
