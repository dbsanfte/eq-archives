But to some other people that&#39;s<br/>\na hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a rent-to-own<br/>\nbasis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s easy to say they<br/>\nshould quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an escape for them. To suddenly<br/>\nnot be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way Verant<br/>\ncould work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so financially<br/>\nstable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if nothing else. Btw,<br/>\nsomeone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap? Where was that again? I<br/>\njust found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of RAM with it&#39;s motherboard and<br/>\nchipset. luv, -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not cost <br/>\n&gt; that much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me <br/>\n&gt; $265 after tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.  The <br/>\n&gt; chip is a AMD Athlon 950.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
