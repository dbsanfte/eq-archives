After we got her a better video card it was much<br/>\nsmoother.<br/>\nI think a 64mb card would be an improvement over a 32. I have a GeForce 2MX<br/>\nwith 64mb and it does fine. My mother has the Xtasy GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128mb<br/>\ncard and it rocks.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Ok here is the difference with me and my friend&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; I have a Geoforce2 with 32MB ram his is the intel<br/>\n&gt; system board 32 MB .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mine actually runs ok but I need to use 800 x 600, no<br/>\n&gt; luclin images, meaning people stuff, and some other<br/>\n&gt; minor tweaks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I use the old UI it runs smoother.<br/>\n&gt; But the 32MB card in mine seems ok or do you think a<br/>\n&gt; better card will REALLY help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- mlockridge01 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What is the brand of your card?

It would be a good move. I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; even seen gforce 4ti<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for around $175. Hopefully you have agp slots. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have only pci, so I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cannot do as I have recommended for you. sigh.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., Rob LeBeau &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I just bought a new machine and have a question.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had some Mouse issues but I solved those but now I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a little skip in the movement when I run or walk.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is like frame by frame.
