Yeah David the Froglocks<br/>\ntook over the Troll city of Grobb, but once I get back (48 days and a wake<br/>\nup!) I will reclaim that city back for Dabashers (at least until the guards<br/>\nrespawn)  Happy Hunting people!<br/>\n<br/>\nDabruiser Troll &lt;Death Alliance&gt;<br/>\nWarrior of the 29th Season<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 20, 2003 7:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Hello, I am back!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome back David!<br/>\nLegends of Ykesha comes with new zones, new items, new tradeskill recipes,<br/>\nand more bank space! not only do you get double your bank space, but they<br/>\nhave now made it so you have 2 additional bank slots that are shared by all<br/>\nof your characters. There is even a shared coin bank part. Ykesha also added<br/>\na new inventory slot for charms. All of the charms I have seen are no drop<br/>\nand are either quested for or dropped from npcs in the Ykesha zones. Oh,<br/>\nYkesha also added a new playable race-- Frogloks. With a special dye only<br/>\nfrom Ykesha you can dye your armor whatever color you want. The only bad<br/>\nthing is that one of the evil races got kicked out of their home and now<br/>\nshare neriak with the darkelves.<br/>\nLost Dungeons of Norrath added new zones and instanced dungeons that only<br/>\nyou and your party can enter. No more fighting over spawns. You can choose<br/>\nyour adventure type and have a time limit for completion. Inside the<br/>\ndungeons there are chests and barrels and such that can be unlocked and<br/>\nopened or bashed into opening up. You need to be careful of these as they<br/>\nare often trapped. Dungeons also added item augmentations. Via quests or<br/>\nkilling mobs you can get magical stones that when combined in a little pool<br/>\nthingy on a pedastel (found in the Wayfarer&#39;s camps) you can augment an<br/>\nitem. The first one you get is the Adventurers stone, which increases the<br/>\nenchantments the more you interact and advance in your status with the<br/>\nwayfarers.<br/>\nIt&#39;s really quite neat. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am back. I have been gone for awhile. But, for the ones that are new and<br/>\ndont remember me. I am David, I am 29. I play EverQuest on a normal bases.<br/>\nBut, right now I havent been on for a while because I had to let my scribes<br/>\ngo for the time being. I am planning to get back soon. I want to get the two<br/>\nnewiest expanesion. Lancy of Ysheka, and the lost dangunes. Please forgive<br/>\nme I am a bad speller. But I like to keep up with it. I have a question<br/>\nwhere do you get EQ IM? And, does it cost anythign extra? Is there in thing<br/>\ngreat about those expanses? I know I have alot of questions. But, I remember<br/>\nthat you guys are really helpful, and I am glad. I hope to make some friends<br/>\nthat like the samethings I do.<br/>\nmuaddib<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
