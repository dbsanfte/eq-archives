I <br/>\njust found about about 6 months ago that you could find out <br/>\ninformation about items that vendors sell by right-clicking on them. <br/>\nDuhhhh. When I first started playing, I bought so many items, only to <br/>\nfind that I couldn&#39;t equip them - waste of money! But some nice <br/>\nhigher-level person told me how to do the &quot;right-click&quot; thing and <br/>\nsaved me a TON of time and money.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I found out the hard way was that you can&#39;t travel to <br/>\nall places without getting killed. I traveled with my Erudite <br/>\nEnchanter to Neriak to buy one of the Enchantment spells and a guard <br/>\nhit me before I even zoned off the book good. Hang in there, you&#39;ll <br/>\nget the hang of it all. Just takes some trial and error.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;armsfullofblessings&quot; <br/>\n&lt;armsfullofblessings@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My name is Peg, and I am glad to have found your e-loop.
