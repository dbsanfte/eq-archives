He did not tell us to run, nor did<br/>\n&gt; he warn us that he was pulling almost half the zone. I was the main<br/>\nhealer.<br/>\n&gt; I saw him injured. So I healed him. Next thing I know, everything is on<br/>\nme.<br/>\n&gt; I asked the backup healer to help me. Backuphealer did nothing. I died. I<br/>\n&gt; was the only one who died though bc after healing and effectively taunting<br/>\n&gt; mobs off the enc, he was able to mez. Right after I repopped after dying a<br/>\n&gt; system message said half an hour til downtime to patch. So, I memmed<br/>\nspells<br/>\n&gt; and was heading back for my corpse. 5 minutes later another system message<br/>\n&gt; said &quot;Servers coming down, log out now&quot; I know this bc I did a /ti to<br/>\n&gt; compare the times. So what does my group do? Rather than help me, they<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; camped and left me there. So now I probably lost all of my stuff. I wish<br/>\n&gt; they wouldn&#39;t lie about how long til patch time.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry, just very frustrated.<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
