The goblins there are about level 8-10 and drop 4 items that are<br/>\nworth 4-5 plat each, depending on the merchant, and your charisma. The<br/>\ngoblins are aggressive to everyone, it seems, and will gang aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nBackbones, Dirjadak&#39;s chipped stein, aqua goblin heads, and goblin blood are<br/>\nthe good drops. The backbones and blood stack, the heads and steins do not.<br/>\nso take lots of backpacks along. I made over 300pp there in about an hour<br/>\nwith a level 14 magician. The biggest problem there is finding a time when<br/>\nthese gobbies are not camped. Don&#39;t sell to the high elf merchant in the<br/>\nruins nearby, he is a cheapskate. Wait till you have tons of loot and then<br/>\ntrek over to Kaladim, if your faction allows. I have gotten decent prices<br/>\nfrom Vacto Molunel, at the entrance to the warrior&#39;s guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few trips there, and then to the Bazaar, and you can be decently equipped<br/>\nwithout twinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor, 46 druid<br/>\nSquiddles, 16 magician<br/>\n<br/>\nand a host of others, on Tarew Marr and Zeboxuruk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
