I saw someone<br/>\nwho had a train of giants do this. She ran into the lava and the giants ran<br/>\nafter her. When the giants stepped back in the lava they got full life back<br/>\nand returned to their spawn points. It apparently nullified the aggro too.<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t work well with the caster ones and king though.<br/>\nOh, a bit of advice for any clerics waiting on Ragefire to pop in sola.. if<br/>\nanyone pulls a train anywhere near you or runs to naggy, camp and wait a few<br/>\nminutes. Sometimes the train runs around rampant after the person dies or<br/>\nescapes and they will jump right on you.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; LOL not on Rodcet, except a few of us old school folks on crap puters.
