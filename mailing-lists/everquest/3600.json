I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on! This only started happening awhile <br/>\nago... and I haven&#39;t changed anything with my computer... I even uninstalled <br/>\na bunch of crap to try and make more room... *shrugs*<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nDeidre<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What expansion do you have? Meaning Lucling, Trilogy,<br/>\n&gt;etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The reason I ask is if it is Luclin, chances are your<br/>\n&gt;video memory is not enough for the rendering, not the<br/>\n&gt;RAM of the system.  If you have 500MB of Ram, you have<br/>\n&gt;plenty to run the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Do you know what video card you have and how much<br/>\n&gt;Video Ram it can handle.  For instance, if I run<br/>\n&gt;Luclin on my laptop, the people show up naked....lol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So your symptoms are different but I bet similar in<br/>\n&gt;cause.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let us know<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rob<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- electrum101 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:electrum101@...\">electrum101@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hey Everybody,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to the list!

I&#39;m hoping one of you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might know what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the heck is going on! Ok, so this is what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happening;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Whenever I zone my characters face will change!?!?!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m thinking it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has something to do with low memory but I have about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 500mb of ram.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And I&#39;m not too keen on computers so if there is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; another form of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; memory that could be lacking please enlighten me!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This stupid problem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has coused me to quit playing for awhile.
