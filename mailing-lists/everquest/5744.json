If you can kill him you&#39;ll at least get<br/>\n&gt; some xp before you die.

I pick a fight with<br/>\n&gt; an orc that cons yellow,<br/>\n&gt;   and a buddy of his joins in who cons blue.  I am<br/>\n&gt; working solo so they are<br/>\n&gt;   both my problem alone.  I have been trying to<br/>\n&gt; figure out the best way to<br/>\n&gt;   deal with them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Take the blue first since I can kill him quicker,<br/>\n&gt; thus I will recieve lets<br/>\n&gt;   hits total during the fight?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Take the yellow though it will take longer to kill<br/>\n&gt; him, and I am getting<br/>\n&gt;   attacked by the blue the whole time, its the<br/>\n&gt; yellow one is doing the most<br/>\n&gt;   damage so the less time I face him the better off<br/>\n&gt; I am.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Or is it pretty much a wash either way?<br/>\n&gt;   ----------<br/>\n&gt;   Her, &quot;Are you still making sandwiches?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   Me, &quot;No, now I am making tunics.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   Her, &quot;And you make fun of Myst because of the lack<br/>\n&gt; of action!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Visit the EverQuest homepage at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
