No th Trade \nskills, Im understand most of them, they&#39;re pretty straitforward...but I do have \na question bout the cooking one. Why? I understand smithing...get ore, make \nbars, make weapons/armour...I know in EQ, every so many time units, you \nautomaticlly eat food. Since rations and milk will fill this funcion, &nbsp;what \nis the purpose of cookin and brewing? Do you get more food value out of \nsomething you&#39;ve made, as oppoised to the rations and bisquits? Can you eat the \nfood and get boosts from it? Same thing for the brewing? Or is it just a vanity \nthing to be walking around with something you cooked as opposed to the iron \nraions and milk thing...</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\"\n size=\"2\">---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A \nhuman being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,<br>butcher a \nhog, design a building, con a ship, write a sonnet, balance<br>accounts, build a \nwall, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders,<br>cooperate, act alone, \nsolve an equation, analyze a new problem, pitch<br>manure, program a computer, \ncook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die<br>gallantly. </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;Specialization is for insects.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Robert A.
