Guess I could go to Google but I thought I<br/>\nwould check with you guys first.  Also, any<br/>\nsuggestions for a really easy quest for my Cleric? <br/>\nOne I might be able to do fairly easily on my own?  I<br/>\nhave got to start learning this game on my own instead<br/>\nof just doing what HE tells me to do...you know, AUTO<br/>\nFOLLOW, ASSIST, Here take this..LOL...LOL...I keep<br/>\nrunning around Freeport afraid to go out cause I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if I could find my way back...I sound pathetic<br/>\ndon&#39;t I?? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNaara, Barb Warrior<br/>\n Chryseas, High Elf Cleric<br/>\nAyonae Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTry FREE Yahoo!
