I&#39;m going to follow that <br/>\nguide and start making myself some coverings and see about selling <br/>\nsome also.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy pc is Electa, Shadow Knight, Human - Lvl 3 roaming Freeport and <br/>\nEast Commonlands at the moment on Tribunal. No Guild.  I&#39;m studying <br/>\nin the tunnels beneath Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the exception of getting dismantled by a Lion and Bear attacking <br/>\nme, with no provoking on my part - its been cool. But if there is a <br/>\nbetter place a Shadow Knight of this low level could find kills or <br/>\nwhat time of guild I should be looking at - I&#39;m very open to advice!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nDLG<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Where are you hunting?<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re in Gfay area I can probably help you out sometime. A cool <br/>\nthing to<br/>\n&gt; do is collect crushbone belts and turn them in. You get some <br/>\npatchwork armor<br/>\n&gt; that you can wear. It&#39;s cruddy, but it&#39;s a start.<br/>\n&gt; Basically kill critters til you get armor. When you start hunting <br/>\nhigher<br/>\n&gt; level mobs they start dropping more coin.<br/>\n&gt; Most of my characters are on the Tribunal.<br/>\n&gt; You can contact Elzeria, Damita, and Tiladanu (I know I&#39;m missing <br/>\nsome but<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t remember their names right now).<br/>\n&gt; What class and race?

I&#39;ve been enjoying it so far on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tribunal Server. THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE! Leveling is pretty balance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Plenty of helpful players!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just looking for advice on how to get more money.  A player <br/>\ngave<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me a sweet sword does high damage, but other than that I&#39;m naked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DLG<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
