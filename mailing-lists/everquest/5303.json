Weddings held \n  in /shout or /ooc are a bad idea.&nbsp; Plus it defeats the entire reason why \n  channels were made.&nbsp; Anybody who wants to attend the wedding should just \n  join the wedding channel.&nbsp; Stop spamming up the public chat with crap \n  people dont necessarily care about except who&#39;s involved.&nbsp; Also, the \n  waterfall in Thurg is a bad choice of places.&nbsp; Granted it&#39;s beautiful to \n  look at, but its a high traffic area.&nbsp; They should expect people to \n  constantly be running through there.&nbsp; Especially for the reason you \n  stated, training mobs to zone to escape.&nbsp; Everyone does it, nobody&#39;s \n  innocent, it&#39;s part of the game.&nbsp; </font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Personally, I wouldn&#39;t think too much of it \n  because there&#39;s nothing they can really do to you to get revenge.&nbsp; And if \n  they do want revenge then they have serious issues cause it&#39;s JUST A \n  GAME!&nbsp; </font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n    <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sastvis@...\" title=\"sastvis@...\">sastvis</a> \n</div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Friday, November 28, 2003 9:00 \n    PM</div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] EQ Weddings held \n    in public</div>\n    <div><br></div><tt>I was in GD today and was slicing through wurms with my \n    trusty <br>necromantic pet when 2 more wurms jumped me and i had to \n    run.&nbsp; The <br>closest zone was thurgadin and i had to pray to \n    cazic-thule that the <br>coldain didn&#39;t hate Iksar Necromancers.<br>I had \n    heard about a wedding being held earlier and i remembered that <br>it was at \n    the waterfall by thurgadin so i shouted train to thurgadin <br>and \n    remembered that i could FD so i did to make sure that i wasn&#39;t <br>killed \n    and that the wurms did&#39;t spoil the wedding.&nbsp; Luckily i was far \n    <br>enough from the wedding that the wurms ran back to their caves.<br>Heres \n    where it stars...&nbsp; First of all the wedding was in OOC.&nbsp; Bad \n    <br>choice.&nbsp; Second the peeps of the wedding kept telling people in the \n    <br>zone to &quot;Shutup&quot; or &quot;Stfu&quot;&nbsp; That was being rude.&nbsp; I proceeded \n    to tell <br>them that they should hold a wedding in SAY or a seperate \n    channel.&nbsp; <br>They all got pissed at me and everyone there kept vowing \n    revenge on <br>me.&nbsp; Made me a bit mad but i held it in so that i didn&#39;t \n    purposefully <br>give them a reason to get mad.&nbsp; They continued to nag \n    on and on so i <br>allerted my guild and they all thought the same \n    thing.&nbsp; A Wedding <br>should be held in private chat and if others talk \n    in the zone just <br>filter the ooc and shouts.&nbsp; The wedding was very \n    badly planned and <br>now i have a whole guild mad at me.&nbsp; ( the other \n    guild that was <br>having the marriage not mine)&nbsp; I was wondering what \n    you all think of <br>weddings in EQ and was i justified in shouting train \n    and telling them <br>that they should hold their wedding in private if they \n    don&#39;t want to <br>hear all the shouts and ooc&#39;s of a zone.&nbsp;
