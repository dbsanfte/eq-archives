I have ppl<br/>\nasking my bard for sow. and she&#39;s lvl 12. I went anon as my cleric and some<br/>\nnewb started following me around asking me for clarity. I told him I&#39;m not<br/>\nan enc. He asked for sow. i explained I couldn&#39;t sow. (I&#39;m a high elf for<br/>\npities sake). Then he asked for str buff. I started to say that I didn&#39;t use<br/>\nreckless str bc it&#39;s negative effects were too annoying. Then my group<br/>\npartner said to the newb &quot;We are on a quest. The mana is reserved for the<br/>\ncompletion of that quest.&quot; and the guy shut up. Heh. my groupie got really<br/>\nprotective. when teh newb pulled mobs over to me when I was medding, my<br/>\ngroupie started saying &quot;Don&#39;t train my cleric! You pull trains on my cleric,<br/>\nI let you die!&quot;<br/>\nSadly the guy didn&#39;t get the hint and he added us both to his friend&#39;s<br/>\nlist...<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t know how but he was looing things we killed right after we<br/>\nkilled them...  some kinda bug.<br/>\nack. didn&#39;t mean to sound complaining. I was actually having fun. once the<br/>\nnewb went away my groupie and I kicked ass and got lots of cool stuff.<br/>\nbtw, the ghoulbane quest is now broken.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I play a level 41 druid on Tarew Marr, and for the very reasons you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>stated,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I go &lt;anon&gt; or &lt;roleplay&gt; when I am grouped and fighting, or otherwise<br/>\n </span></blockquote>busy.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At least then people cannot pick me out from some far-off place with /who<br/>\n&gt; all druid 39 44, for example.
