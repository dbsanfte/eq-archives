Not bad, but I am not making any money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Previously I farmed Brutes in Warsliks Woods. Nominal experience, but<br/>\n&gt; made lots of cash.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas where I can go as a lvl 35 Druid to get a good balance of<br/>\n&gt; cash/loot and experience? Mostly I solo, as I am usually in for an<br/>\n&gt; hour at a time. Get in a few hours together now and then, but for<br/>\n&gt; short sessions getting a group consumes most of the time available.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
