I and two co-conspirators once held the game <br/>\nhostage. We gained enough resources to fabricate a sufficient number <br/>\nof fighters to surround the entry point zones. No one could get out <br/>\nof the entry zones after dying without being overcome by our forces.<br/>\nThe bbs owner finally restarted the game with significant changes. <br/>\nIncreased the npc ship production rate enormously to keep evil <br/>\noverlord types too busy to pull such a stunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, my system crashed and I spent the following decade actually <br/>\ninteracting with people. Never learned how to overcome the new <br/>\nchallenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad to be back in the cyberworld, even with present problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Biltilie Dwimmerlaik&quot; &lt;biltilie@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; On 11 Oct 2002 at 13:40, mlockridge01 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thinking Earth and Beyond looks promising.
