(Hurd is not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1952566358\">Bouncer Hurd (ogre) and one of his other bouncer buds (ogre) patrol around<br/>\nthe outside and outskirts of the Cazic Thule dungeon in Feerott.  (Hurd is<br/>\nnot actually inside the dungeon itself)  He quite frequently, along with his<br/>\nbud, comes INTO the corridor safe zone area where you zone into Cazic itself<br/>\nand starts killing everyone who is trying to heal who zoned out of Cazic<br/>\nfrom the notorious trains.<br/>\n<br/>\nHurd is a VERY nasty, VERY hard and fast hitting ogre whom I have only seen<br/>\nkilled by like a 35+ mob.  I did see a 42 level paladin in full plate armor<br/>\nfully buffed with a ghoulbane kill him solo, but that was only because I was<br/>\nstanding behind him and putting greater heals on him until I ran out of<br/>\nmana, and then two others players jumped in at the end to help finish him<br/>\noff.  And if Hurd&#39;s bud is with him, you are in double trouble.  I was<br/>\nsitting and medding at the zone when they both showed up and literally in<br/>\nless than 2 seconds, stunned me, double teamed me and took out about 3/4 of<br/>\nmy hps (I am level 39).  If I had not been at full health and been 2 inches<br/>\nfrom the zone I would&#39;ve died.  A friend of mine died to Hurd and his<br/>\nbouncer bud 4 times in about 3 minutes....he was bound in the corridor right<br/>\noutside the cazic zone, so each time Hurd killed him and he reappeared, Hurd<br/>\nand his friend killed him again.  He was NOT a happy shaman that nite.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, Hurd is the one with the crude stein, but not always.  It&#39;s a rare<br/>\nspawn from what I am told.  I was lucky enough to get one from that paladin<br/>\nI kept healed and buffed so he could solo Hurd.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 14, 1999 9:16 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Crude Stein<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can anyone verify if the Crude Stein is found in Cazic Thule on Bouncer<br/>\n&gt;Hurd? If so, where can Bouncer Hurd be found? Also, how rare is he of a<br/>\n&gt;spawn (and for that matter, how rare is the stein?)
