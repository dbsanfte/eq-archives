Meaning, if you<br/>\nmade lots of cash then why not just find a place where<br/>\nthe exp is Excellent.  My attitude is you can always<br/>\nmake money in the higher levels.  Or take up a trade<br/>\nlike pottery and get your skill up to make things that<br/>\nsell for good PP.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents...... I have a 32 druid and currently<br/>\nhunt in the Overthere and I find the PP good as well<br/>\nas the exp.  But I am grouping since lots of baddies<br/>\nresist spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n--- mlockridge01 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have been hunting Snow Cougars in Iceclad for a<br/>\n&gt; level and a half. <br/>\n&gt; The experience is good, and whether solo or duo the<br/>\n&gt; time invested is <br/>\n&gt; about the same.

Mostly I solo, as I am<br/>\n&gt; usually in for an <br/>\n&gt; hour at a time. Get in a few hours together now and<br/>\n&gt; then, but for <br/>\n&gt; short sessions getting a group consumes most of the<br/>\n&gt; time available.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
