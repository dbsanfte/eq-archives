I want to get her high enough to group <br/>\nport to<br/>\n&gt; EC. Right now she can do Toxx, NK, and GFay. But EC would be much <br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; useful to port to. Finding groups is difficult for her. I want to <br/>\nfind<br/>\n&gt; something I can solo that won&#39;t kill my faction with my DE kin but <br/>\nwon&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; ruin any good faction i&#39;ve earned with the good guys.<br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; When I was a level 14 druid someone on the list suggested <br/>\nLavastorm.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was there until level 19. The loot is pretty good, cash anything<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from poor to fair, and the hunting interesting. Getting there was <br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; special adventure for me, as I am KOS in Neriak. I went in chamo <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; levitated, turned left as I entered the forest, and kept to the <br/>\nzone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wall. There is a river half way through the zone, which I levved<br/>\n&gt; &gt; across (not being a good swimmer) and kept on along the wall.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I really liked the rock dervishes. Good cash and they dropped ore,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which sells well but is heavy. I would pick up a load until I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; encumbered even with strength, then port to a selling point. If <br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can find someone to port the stuff out at a discount, the ore <br/>\nwould<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be profitable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I mostly solo, so that is what I did there. Lots of fun.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Good hunting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., Pedgar1787@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Where to go to fight for a 15 Shaman?
