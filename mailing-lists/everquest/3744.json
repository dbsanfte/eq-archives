I really enjoy this server.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill have my 54 rogue alt and 49 SK alt on Rodcet Nife tho.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&quot;Hey Barto, how did you map the sense heading to  your right turn &gt;&gt;key?  and does this free up hotkey space for other things?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No it does not free up a space. What you are actually doing is replacing the number that would normally activate that space, with a different key. Say for instance if you mapped hotkey 5 to your right turn key, the &quot;5&quot; key would no longer activate that space, it could only be activated by the arrow. You would then place your sense heading button, or any other button for that matter, in that space.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll you have to do is bring up your options menu (while in game), go to the keyboard tab, then scroll down to where the hotbox numbers are. Click on the hotbox number you want to change and then replace it with the key you want it to activate with. The thing you have to remember is that it changes it, across the board, for every page and every character.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this makes sense to you, I almost confused myself =P<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe NEW Netscape 7.0 browser is now available.
