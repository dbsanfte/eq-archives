Having too many people logging in<br/>\nand whatnot.  I also noticed last night that when a server goes down, the<br/>\nnewbie count goes WAY up as people switch over to another server for a bit<br/>\njust so they can keep playing.  On PVP, that means a LOT of resources taken<br/>\nup for the corpse count at the newbie entrance.  At least outside of Qeynos<br/>\nit was that way, must&#39;ve been over 30 bodies laying on the ground outside<br/>\nof the entrance to Qeynos.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LeSamLam@...\">LeSamLam@...</a> on 04/20/2001 08:54:42 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\ncc:<br/>\nSubject:  Re: [EverQuest] Connect time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I kept going LD last night and that&#39;s what it was doing when<br/>\nwe tried to sign back on.  Computer #1 is P2-350 256 meg ram, Windows ME,<br/>\n40<br/>\ngig HD, 8x burner.  Computer #2 is Celeron 533, 192 meg ram, 10 gig HD,<br/>\nWindows ME.  Both are on cable modem using ICS.  We finally gave up because<br/>\nof the lag and linkdead problems and then trying to get signed back into<br/>\ngame.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it just me, or is it taking longer and longer to connect?  I couldn&#39;t<br/>\neven get past the login screen for 5 or 10 minutes.  Kept saying that it<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t connect to login server.  Never had that happen unless it was down<br/>\nfor a patch (which it wasn&#39;t).  Also noticed that the times when I choose<br/>\nmy server, and going to the character screen, and the time from the<br/>\ncharacter screen to the game are much longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m running a Celeron 533 w/ 185 MB ram, windows ME a cable modem, and<br/>\nabout 2GB of drive space for windows to write to.  Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                            <br/>\n                            Yahoo!
