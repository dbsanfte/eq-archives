Mine is only <br/>\na level 6 halfling warrior, but I have invested quite a bit of time <br/>\nin just getting this far. I know I can build another character a bit <br/>\nfaster based on what I have learned, but is that investment of time <br/>\nworthwhile?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a second character just started, but that was only <br/>\nsomething to play when the area my halfling was camped in was shut <br/>\ndown for repairs. I am thinking more on building a second character <br/>\nfor tactical purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I wandered out of Rivervale to High Hold Pass one day, <br/>\nand was slaughtered by Orcs. I managed to sneak back to recover my <br/>\nstuff, but could not get out fast enough. I gave up that corpse, and <br/>\nconcentrated on building in Misty Thicket.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought is to build a character over time just to get through High <br/>\nPass Hold. My greater interest is in the warrior working his way <br/>\nacross Misty Thicket. Am I wasting valuable game time on this second <br/>\ncharacter? High Pass Hold seems extremely difficult, and might not be <br/>\nworth the effort until much later in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nSamwiseguy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
