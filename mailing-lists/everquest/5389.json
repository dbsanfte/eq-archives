As a monk (my main) my trouble right<br/>\n&gt; now is that mamby pamby tanks can&#39;t hold aggros when<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m hitting the mobs.  The art of monkish melee is not<br/>\n&gt; to do maximal damage, but to do just a little less<br/>\n&gt; damage than the tank I&#39;m paired with.  If I&#39;m paired<br/>\n&gt; with a bard or a pally then forget it.  I might as<br/>\n&gt; well hold a fishing pole in my primary hand.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t know how many times the tank I&#39;m working<br/>\n&gt; with has over-aggroed and gotten the group killed. <br/>\n&gt; You also don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve seen bards<br/>\n&gt; having to kite their adds and pull in even more<br/>\n&gt; because harmony fails :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let a monk pull onsies... lots safer for the group<br/>\n&gt; that way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Quwi Changkane Fenin Ro Grandmaster </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
