My favorite trade I ever made was when I<br/>\ntraded an SMR and 2k pp for an Ishva Robe.  I then traded the Ishva robe for<br/>\n1 pair of Golden Efreeti Boots, 1 SMR, 1 55hp 55mana necklace and 1 Box of<br/>\nAbu Kar.  I then traded the 55hp 55mana necklace for another pair of Golden<br/>\nEfreeti Boots.  All of this was Pre-Kunark/50+ so GEBS and SMR&#39;s were really<br/>\nexpensive (13k and 10k or so respectively.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy worst trade? Maybe the last one I did before I left I traded a Fungi<br/>\nTunic for a Bloodfire and 10kpp.  But its probobly the one item I have<br/>\nwanted ever since I could remember, well not counting the Bladestorm, Katana<br/>\nof Steel Sleet.  But they took that out of the game pretty quick.  That<br/>\nweapon was just really crazy don&#39;t know how it ever made it into the game<br/>\n(30/45 2hs with a 970 something or other AoE proc.  It proc&#39;d in waves so<br/>\nyou could move out of the waves you saw it had proc&#39;d.)  Anyone know of<br/>\nsomeone with this sword?  I know of only one on my server but the guy moved<br/>\nwith the split.  They wouldn&#39;t let him use it in the Warrior Best of the<br/>\nBest.  Well, rambled long enough.  5 months 3 weeks till I can play EQ<br/>\nagain.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\nLost at Sea</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
