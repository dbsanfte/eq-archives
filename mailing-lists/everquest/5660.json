I fell through the wall and down to zonein from the<br/>\npurple stairs camp in BoT. I was advised not to touch the walls in PoJ. A<br/>\nfew people fell through walls in Ssra and ended up in the deep depths<br/>\nsurrounded by mobs. Some of the problems are still occurring. Right now<br/>\nthere is a bug with the lifts. I have to jump up when the lift starts to<br/>\nmove to not have it pass through me. Or I have to be levitating. I think<br/>\nbecause EQ upgraded it&#39;s graphics engine there are still bugs to work out. I<br/>\nwas once told how EQ did the player movement that it doesn&#39;t keep a constant<br/>\nwatch on where you are but that it checks back every x amount of time. So<br/>\nsometimes the last time it checked on you, you were lower down and it then<br/>\nchecks to see again and thinks you are lower when you should be higher and<br/>\nthe lift is now above you so you fall through. They really need to fix that.<br/>\nSome people couldn&#39;t get flagged bc t<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping this will be fixed soon.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; ========<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     after uprading my video driver to run everquest better i now see the<br/>\nstars in the night sky over freeport but i didn&#39;t see the moon i saw a hazy<br/>\nspot is that where the moon is supposed tyo be?  also my friend keeps faling<br/>\nthrough  wall on the plane of justice is that due to the upgrade of the<br/>\ngame?  I do find the graphics are nicer looking after the patches.  I also<br/>\nnoticed some lag as well once the dx9 went into effect but not  as much as i<br/>\n ecpecxted reading all the posts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
