Try <br/>\nnot to get lost and never, ever, zone unless you know where you are <br/>\ngoing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGet one of your friends to help you.  Don&#39;t be afraid to shout for <br/>\nhelp.  People will usually give it.  Be nice to everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t waste mana and don&#39;t waste money.  It may seem trivial at the <br/>\nfirst few levels (&quot;8 copper for a ruined wolf pelt?  Yee hah!&quot;) but <br/>\nbelieve me, if you concentrate on experience alone, you are going to <br/>\nfind yourself broke in a hurry.  You need money to get spells and <br/>\nfood.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first few lvls you don&#39;t need to loot your corpse.  Lvl 4 and <br/>\nup you will.  Very important: if you have a poor sense of direction, <br/>\nalways always always type &quot;/loc&quot; when you&#39;re in a losing battle.  <br/>\nThis saves you walking all along the zone wailing &quot;Has anyone seen my <br/>\ncorpse?&quot; and tensely counting down your 24 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind a race and class that will fit your needs.  Talk to your friends <br/>\non this.  They can give you great tips, I bet.  This is important.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, just have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Lizz<br/>\nMadeleine on Tellon Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
