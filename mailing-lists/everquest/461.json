I checked the first one,<br/>\nit was your usual inn-type shop. Went to the second one, a stock of leather<br/>\narmor. Ok then, I check the third, and apparently some player had dumped a<br/>\nsuit of Bronze Armor on it. So, I check it&#39;s stats and quickly learn that<br/>\n<br/>\n#1. It&#39;s much heavier than plate<br/>\n#2. It&#39;s the same AC as plate<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I go to check the prices, expecting the usual 5800+ platinum plate costs.<br/>\nAfter doing a near double-take, I realize the total cost for the set is 210<br/>\nplatinum. So, I quickly run my Troll hide to Oggok and grabwhat little plat<br/>\nI had (36 or so) and bought the Tunic and Collar/Gorget.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, getting to my question, this stuff may be much heavier, but a 5600 plat<br/>\npriceslash for weight? What&#39;s the deal on that? Since I couldn&#39;t afford a<br/>\nfull suit now, I was interested in picking some up, and was told I could do<br/>\nso in HighPass Hold. Where in HighPass can I find it and on what monster(s)?<br/>\nAnd was this price a fluke, or is this the going rate? If so, why would<br/>\nanybody ever buy Normal Plate? I do realize a full suit (and I added it<br/>\ntogether) weighs about 86 pounds, which is quite hefty, is that the only<br/>\nreason it is so much cheaper?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a bunch,<br/>\nRukkak<br/>\nImpressing his low-level friends with is Plate Tunic =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
