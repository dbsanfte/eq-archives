If your pretty good at travelling, you can get to my favorite place to <br/>\nfight at slightly-low levels.  You need to go from Kelething to Kaladim <br/>\nfirst. I&#39;ve never done this and heard that it can be dangerous. Once you get <br/>\nto Kaladim, I would suggest finding someone who can bind you there. Then <br/>\ntake the boat ride (approx. 40 - 1hr full round trip) to Freeport. Then <br/>\nagain get bound there so you don&#39;t have to ride the boring boat again. (FYI <br/>\n- I would not suggest moving around on the ship a lot, while it is moving <br/>\nitself. I have gotten stuck before between the mast and the wall on the 2nd <br/>\nlevel of the ship, and was a real pain waiting 2 1/2 hours for a GM around 4 <br/>\nAM.) Then you might want to find a person(s) heading in your same direction, <br/>\nas this would be your first time. And watch out for griffons and hill giants <br/>\nwhen passing through east/west commonlands. They seem to &quot;disapeer&quot; when <br/>\nflying sometimes, and then pop-up behind and you fall to your death almost <br/>\ninstantly. From the west commonlands you zone into a forest called Kithicor <br/>\n(I think?). Then just follow the zone border to the right, and when you get <br/>\nto the rocky mountainside just go to the base and there should be the <br/>\nentrance there. Then don&#39;t forget to get bound here to. Then there are <br/>\nmultiple things you can do here. There is a dungeon named RunnyEye (Which is <br/>\nusually for higher levels [20 or so]) but there are 3 goblin camps here. And <br/>\n1 orc camp. At level 4 I would just stick to the Klicknak&#39;s inside the great <br/>\nwall, then at five go past the wall and look for shadow wolfs, and sometimes <br/>\nbalck bears. At 6-9 I would say just start solo&#39;ing the goblins. Verant <br/>\nseems to have up&#39;ed the loot on them and now as a level 8 paladin. I can <br/>\nbring in 10 - 15pp a day without so much work. The EXP here is great.<br/>\n<br/>\nIrontoe (Xegony)<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. If you can&#39;t travel...
