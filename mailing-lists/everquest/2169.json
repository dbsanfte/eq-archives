The first guild I was in seemed cool at first. Although<br/>\nI should have questioned it a bit more considering they didn&#39;t even ask me<br/>\nif I wanted to join. I was fighting a battle and an invite popped up. I<br/>\nclicked NO. Bc it was getting in the way of my fight. It popped up again.<br/>\nAgain I hit NO. Then it popped up again so I clicked YES just to make it<br/>\nstop popping up. At that point I was so new to the game I really didn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand what a guild was. Anyways, I made some good friends and was<br/>\nhaving fun. But I noticed less and less of my friends were on.. I started<br/>\nthinking about leaving. But my favorite person in the guild was a guild<br/>\nofficer and I didn&#39;t want to abandon her. Then I ran into my favorite person<br/>\nin the guild and she was in a different guild. I asked what happened and she<br/>\nsaid that there had been some bickering amongst some of the leading members.<br/>\nShe was very nice to me as always. Later on I was still thinking of leaving<br/>\nbut was having fun conversations with the guild leaders. But the very next<br/>\nday I mentioned my favorite person and that I was sorry she left the guild.<br/>\nThey started trashtalking her. I told them that I had really enjoyed the<br/>\nguild because of her. Then they told me the only reason I was still in the<br/>\nguild was bc none of the officers were in the same zone with me to disband<br/>\nme. they started trashtalking me and claimed that I had badmouthed the<br/>\nguild. What had really happened was someone asked me how I liked the guild<br/>\nand I said I liked it fine. I said it was cool. I happened to add that I<br/>\nthought another guild was cool too. I didn&#39;t say it was better or anything,<br/>\njust that they were both cool. So that person reported to my guildleaders<br/>\nthat I badmouthed the guild. See, I had an alt in the other guild. I figured<br/>\nbc they are different characters it didnt&#39; really matter. After badmouthing<br/>\nme the guild leaders told me I had a choice: I could leave the guild or take<br/>\nmy alts out of the other guild. I told them that it was really sad bc we&#39;d<br/>\nbeen friends the day before. But they were being so pissy. so I asked them<br/>\nhow I could disband myself from the guild. and I did it right then. I went<br/>\nstraight to the other guild and they invited me in right away.<br/>\nIt&#39;s sad how guilds can be so fickle.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Yes, it can happen to you!  A few days ago, my hubby was having fun<br/>\n&gt; with some guildmates when POOF! the guild was no more.  Took some<br/>\n&gt; figuring out but apparently the person that originally started the<br/>\n&gt; guild and was tagged as the &#39;owner&#39; wanted to make a new guild but was<br/>\n&gt; unable because she was still listed as owning Circle of Majik.  She<br/>\n&gt; had been forced out of the guild about a year ago because of her<br/>\n&gt; thievery and lying.  She was unwelcome with the current leadership of<br/>\n&gt; Gawabiwa and could not get control except by force.  She went to<br/>\n&gt; Verant and had her leader powers reinstated then promptly dropped<br/>\n&gt; everyone out of the guild without any kind of warning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What a dirty underhanded thing to do!  She didn&#39;t have to drop<br/>\n&gt; everyone! or even anyone!  She could have come in and told everyone<br/>\n&gt; before hand, instead she had to yank it out from under us.  It hurt us<br/>\n&gt; to the core, but Gawabiwa has built a close knit guild and we are not<br/>\n&gt; our name.  We will rebuild our guild and get ourselves back on track.<br/>\n&gt;  We won&#39;t be having anything to do with whatever guild she has whether<br/>\n&gt; called Circle of Majik or not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have lots of support too.
