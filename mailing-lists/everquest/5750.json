While each one is a little different they all have some<br/>\nthings in common.  They claim there is an e-mail address that was set up by<br/>\nSony then forgotten about.  If you send an e-mail to this address with<br/>\ncertain codes in it you can modify your character.  The messages go into a<br/>\nlot of detail listing all the codes, what they do, and how to use them.  In<br/>\norder to make sure the cheat works on your character you need to include<br/>\nyour Station username and password in the e-mail.  I should not have to say<br/>\nany more but just in case you don&#39;t get it, whoever runs the e-mail address<br/>\nis sure not Sony, its a loser who wants to steal your account.  Never e-mail<br/>\nyour password to anyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Plat guides I have looked at are all way out of date.  None of them have<br/>\nmentioned POK or how the Bazzar has made many of the methods they describe<br/>\nobsolete.  They also claim you can make 100plat or more an hour with a level<br/>\n1 character, what they don&#39;t say is that you first need to spend a number of<br/>\nhours maxing out that characters trade skills and that your char will need<br/>\nsome plat in advance to pull it off.  I really did not see anything that I<br/>\ndid not already know from reading EQtraders or other websites.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also found a secret way to get into EQII beta!  Just send you username and<br/>\npassword to this secret e-mail address...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
