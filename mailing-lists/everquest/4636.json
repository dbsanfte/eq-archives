My pet and I have been killing Greater<br/>\n&gt; Scalebones and Greater <br/>\n&gt; Skeletons in Kurn&#39;s Tower. Started there 2 days ago<br/>\n&gt; at level 14, and <br/>\n&gt; am now a couple small bubbles from 18. I have been<br/>\n&gt; donating for a KEI <br/>\n&gt; buff in PoK before I go there, and in turn have been<br/>\n&gt; casting Breeze, <br/>\n&gt; Mist, Strength, Rune I, Quickness, and Intellectual<br/>\n&gt; Advancement <br/>\n&gt; spells on other players in Kurn&#39;s to try and help<br/>\n&gt; them out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been buffing my pet with Mist, Strength,<br/>\n&gt; Quickness, Rune I, <br/>\n&gt; and myself with those buffs plus Intellectual<br/>\n&gt; Advancement and <br/>\n&gt; Shielding. I use Root when there is only one target<br/>\n&gt; around, and Mez <br/>\n&gt; on a target when there are others in the area. Then<br/>\n&gt; I hit them with <br/>\n&gt; Chaotic Feedback and Choke, alternating until the<br/>\n&gt; target breaks the <br/>\n&gt; Mez/Root and then my pet finishes it off. I read<br/>\n&gt; somewhere that this <br/>\n&gt; is called &quot;Root and Nuke&quot; and that it isn&#39;t very<br/>\n&gt; effective. I am <br/>\n&gt; wondering if there are other ways I should be going<br/>\n&gt; about trying to <br/>\n&gt; fight as opposed to this? Should I be using my<br/>\n&gt; dagger in combination <br/>\n&gt; to the rooting/nuking? Any feedback would be great.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enie, Erudite Enchantress<br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
