He is <br/>\nnuts...he bought me EverQuest, Ruins of Kunark, Shadows of Luclin and now <br/>\nPlanes of Power, all in a month or so...he is spoiling me! I keep telling <br/>\nhim no more, I will buy the expansions I need, but he doesn&#39;t listen...he <br/>\nalso bought me a three month EverQuest card. He is completely nuts, but I am <br/>\nvery thankful. I ordered him the Scars of Velious expansion off of <br/>\nEBay...that is the only expansion he needs. Same here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for learning how to play EverQuest, I know how the newbies feel. I am <br/>\nfairly new, and if it wasn&#39;t for my boyfriend to teach me everything, I <br/>\nwould be so lost.
