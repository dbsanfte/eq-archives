Basically we<br/>\nwere not allowed to return from overseas for 9 years<br/>\nand when we came back our house and property had been<br/>\ntotally trashed. We&#39;ve sunk at least $60,000 into the<br/>\nplace in repairs. But we got hit by 2 hurricanes and<br/>\ngot no help from FEMA. Our insurance claimed to have<br/>\nno record of our policy and refused to pay anything.<br/>\nAdd to that I&#39;ve had heart problems and had to have<br/>\nsome medical procedures-- insurance deductible is very<br/>\nhigh. Between fixing things up we are trying to find a<br/>\nlawyer to sue the doctor who screwed up on my father<br/>\nwhich has so far cost us at least $20,000 in medical<br/>\nbills (not counting the gasoline of travelling to<br/>\nHouston and hotels and such). We had to take out 2<br/>\nmortgages on the house and cannot sell it in its<br/>\ncurrent condition. Even if we could, we still have<br/>\nlivestock that we don&#39;t want to part with and there<br/>\nreally isn&#39;t a place in our price range that we could<br/>\nafford to move them to. <br/>\nWe are going to have to spend even more money because<br/>\nthe power company did something that caused a huge<br/>\nsurge and fried several of our surge suppressors (so<br/>\nbadly that one of them burned the floor). <br/>\nI&#39;m not even going to go into the vet bills... <br/>\nIts one of those neverending things..<br/>\nOk. I&#39;ve vented enough about that...<br/>\nOh man, I know exactly what you mean on the running<br/>\nacross the zone and then being warped back and dead. I<br/>\nhate that!<br/>\nDon&#39;t laptops overheat? Or have they found a way to<br/>\nfix that now?<br/>\nLag just sucks bigtime.<br/>\nTradeskills can be fun, but frustrating. I really<br/>\nworked on them for my 8th shawl. Too bad that it soon<br/>\nturned out to be lame stats compared to other stuff<br/>\nyou can get now-- for much less work. I did almost all<br/>\nof the droppable combines for my brother&#39;s rogue epic<br/>\n1.5. I tell ya.. Why can&#39;t the cleric epic 1.5 have<br/>\nthe tradeskills instead?

See I fried my desktop, and with money a<br/>\n&gt; bit short these days, I am set to play EQ on a<br/>\n&gt; laptop, that wont quite handle it well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It takes 10 minutes to log in, if it does. If it<br/>\n&gt; does then there is no guarantee that I will stay and<br/>\n&gt; if I do, how long I will stay in. If I&#39;m in, I lagg<br/>\n&gt; so badly it sucks. I can run halfway across a zone<br/>\n&gt; and not realize I was lagging the whole time, so<br/>\n&gt; when it unlaggs im back where i started from. I can<br/>\n&gt; aatack something, and by the time I unlagg its dead.<br/>\n&gt; IIm afraid to hunt with my 61 bst right now because<br/>\n&gt; of it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hunted at the OC in POV the other night, and i<br/>\n&gt; lagged so baadly as i was chasing down the kill, i<br/>\n&gt; ended up halway across the zone, but that was<br/>\n&gt; because of a stuck button......and not being<br/>\n&gt; familiar too familiar with the zone, i nearly<br/>\n&gt; trained everyone<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So needless to say, Most of my toons are maaxing<br/>\n&gt; their tradeskills and all skills in general just by<br/>\n&gt; hanging out in POK. So I shouldnt complain really,<br/>\n&gt; at least I can get in and hear thatt wonderful irish<br/>\n&gt; pub song as i run by the &quot;still&quot; in PoK...lol<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As always<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Greg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Su Johnston &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt; wrote:    I looked<br/>\n&gt; into Norton Ghost and it had really bad<br/>\n&gt;  reviews on downloads.com. One of the reviewers<br/>\n&gt;  mentioned a less expensive program (with better<br/>\n&gt;  reviews) called Acronis True Image. I think I will<br/>\n&gt;  look into the abilities of the Acronis one to see<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt;  it would work for what I want to do. If not I may<br/>\n&gt; see<br/>\n&gt;  about going with Norton Ghost 10.0. I really really<br/>\n&gt;  appreciate the info!<br/>\n&gt;  I just need to remember to burn something to DVD to<br/>\n&gt;  help restore windows XP in case there is a problem<br/>\n&gt;  when I upgrade to the new mainboard setup.<br/>\n&gt;  Direcway just sold out to Hughes.net and the<br/>\n&gt; service<br/>\n&gt;  has really declined. I keep having pages timeout<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt;  loading and get errors, their tech support no<br/>\n&gt; longer<br/>\n&gt;  works (can&#39;t get through to anyone), and my pop3<br/>\n&gt; email<br/>\n&gt;  no longer works (despite my following their<br/>\n&gt; tutorials<br/>\n&gt;  on setting it up). So I had to switch to using<br/>\n&gt; yahoo<br/>\n&gt;  email. bleh. I think its evident I&#39;m more than a<br/>\n&gt; teeny<br/>\n&gt;  bit annoyed. <br/>\n&gt;  The bandwidth cap is a major pain. When I first<br/>\n&gt; signed<br/>\n&gt;  up they said that unless I was constantly loading<br/>\n&gt;  really large files at a high rate of speed I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  have to worry about the cap. That was before they<br/>\n&gt;  lowered the amount of bandwidth allowed before<br/>\n&gt;  capping. Loading a patch for EQ takes about 4 hours<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt;  more. Its really annoying. I lose connection<br/>\n&gt; whenever<br/>\n&gt;  it rains-- or sometimes when its bright and sunny<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt;  no apparent reason. I would not recommend this<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;service&quot; to anyone. I had to call tech support<br/>\n&gt; sooo<br/>\n&gt;  many times that I memorized some of the routines<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;  then one of the techs in India started flirting<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt;  me (which was actually pretty funny).<br/>\n&gt;  Man..

It<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; do exactly what you want it to do.  I&#39;ve used it<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; several times on my own systems when installing<br/>\n&gt; new<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; hard drives to set as primary.  Basically, what<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; do is install the new drive as a slave,<br/>\n&gt; completely<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; wiped (you dont even have to partition it).  Then<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; you install Norton&#39;s Ghost on your main drive. <br/>\n&gt; Run<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Norton&#39;s Ghost and choose the option to do a<br/>\n&gt; direct<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; ghost copy to the new drive.  Everything right<br/>\n&gt; down<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; to the partitions will be copied to the new<br/>\n&gt; drive. <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Then you shut down the machine, switch the drive<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; over to master and reboot.  Barring any major<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; problems it&#39;ll boot up exactly as if it were the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; regular drive on that system.  Then you can take<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; original drive and wipe it and use it as a<br/>\n&gt; secondary<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; for extra space.  It&#39;s a handy program.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Your system sounds decent enough to run EQ albeit<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; with some lag in the newer zones.  Turning off a<br/>\n&gt; lot<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; of options might help that though.  However, on<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; DirecWay I wouldn&#39;t expect too much.  DirecWay is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; bad about limiting the amount of data that can be<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; sent at any given time.  If you send mroe than<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; are allowed to, they pretty much stop all<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; communication and give you some stupid message<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; exceedxing the bandwidth.  Then it takes like 5<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; minutes to reset.  You can look it up, the info<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; right there ont he DirecWay site.  That&#39;s why<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; don&#39;t reccomend using DirecWay for gaming.  But<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; all you want to do is browse the web and chat,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; fine.
