Then, I have heard people talking about some games where a player <br/>\ncould buy corpse insurance: if you die then you get back everything that <br/>\nyou were carrying. I don&#39;t like corpse runs either. It takes away from the <br/>\nfun in the game. It might be more fun if you had a chance of coming back as <br/>\na random race/creature each time that you died and had to stay that way for <br/>\na number of game days before you returned to normal. That could work for or <br/>\nagainst you. It would force players to temporarily use characters of other <br/>\nraces and learn more about them.<br/>\n         I would not eliminate rezzes. What would be the point of investing <br/>\ntime into building up a character only to lose everything in a single <br/>\nfight? I&#39;d stop playing the game. I wouldn&#39;t even have to think about it. <br/>\nThe fun of playing the game wouldn&#39;t be worth the time spent and lost, <br/>\nspent and lost yet again developing a temporary character. For me, the fun <br/>\nof the game is watching my character grow. Without that, the battles and <br/>\ntreasure are pointless to me and so is the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdward Fox<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:23 AM 8/16/2003 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Good point. The only good thing I thought of for corpse runs was that you<br/>\n&gt;can be summoned back to your corpse so you don&#39;t have to make the trek to<br/>\n&gt;wherever you died all over again. But yeah, if you can&#39;t find your corpse<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s a royal pain.<br/>\n&gt;Would you have it so you have all your gear but can still be rezzed? or<br/>\n&gt;would you just eliminate rezzes?<br/>\n&gt;luv,<br/>\n&gt;-Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or, if you could go back in time and change something about Everquest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s creation to have certain features, what would you have done<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; differently?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Definitely I would get rid of the corpse-hunting. I understand losing exp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when you die, I think that&#39;s a good thing (well not GOOD but it makes<br/>\n&gt;sense) but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going back to find your body to get all your stuff back just sucks.<br/>\n&gt;Especially<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when you die somewhere you can&#39;t get back to. WHY can&#39;t you ever find a<br/>\n&gt;necro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when you need one?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sail to your heart&#39;s desires, and know when to drop anchor.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
