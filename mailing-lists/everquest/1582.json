If that was the<br/>\ncase, mind you that�s such a far fetched example of<br/>\nsomeone hacking your system for the mere purpose of<br/>\nstealing your everquest account.  It&#39;s still under the<br/>\nresponsibility of the player.  How could you ever<br/>\nprove to Verant that your account was hacked in such<br/>\nfashion?  I guess they should just recreate objects<br/>\nthat you have deleted accidentally too.  They are<br/>\nresponsible for the program and its integrity itself<br/>\nnot for the inability for its users to properly defend<br/>\nthemselves.  They&#39;ve implemented a lot of changes to<br/>\nhelp protect the player from themselves =) and the<br/>\ncommunity of EQ players at large are happy.  I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t worry about that new statement, GMs can do<br/>\nwhatever they want, its simply path the company would<br/>\nlike to follow for a majority.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonal responsibility sucks sure.. btw..
