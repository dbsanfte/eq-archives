I now have three character between level 10 and 15.  I have<br/>\nbeen going to Crushbone alot to hunt, and the tower in the field of bone is<br/>\ncool but I am getting tired of the same old stuff.  Where else can a<br/>\ncharacter in the 10-20 range go to hunt where he can find a group easily?  I<br/>\nhave looked over the EQ Atlas and see a lot of stuff for 1-10 and 30+.<br/>\nSince I may try some more class-race combos before I try and take anybody<br/>\nover 20 I could use some more places to fill the gap between newbie and<br/>\nexperienced.  I am not interested in power-leveling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have EQ Evolution, so every expansion but LDON.  I play on the Tunare<br/>\n(sp?) server.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
