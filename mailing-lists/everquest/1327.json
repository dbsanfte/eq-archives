Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br/>\n&gt; healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br/>\n&gt; totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>\n&gt; loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they<br/>\n&gt; care<br/>\n&gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>\n&gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>\n&gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>\n&gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>\n&gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>\n&gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>\n&gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>\n&gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>\n&gt; expensive<br/>\n&gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>\n&gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>\n&gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>\n&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>\n&gt; Just wondering.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>\n&gt; people cooperate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
