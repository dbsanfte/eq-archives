She is a<br/>\n&gt; lvl<br/>\n&gt; 60 woodelf ranger and only about 30% away from<br/>\n&gt; hitting<br/>\n&gt; level 61.  She resides on the Tunare server and is a<br/>\n&gt; member of the guild Infinite Storm.<br/>\n&gt; (working on a character story for her... its a long<br/>\n&gt; one and consists of close to 4 chapters now.  Can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; seem to condense it very well.  To much of a story<br/>\n&gt; teller in me to make anything to short)<br/>\n&gt; I have 3 others that I play as often as I can when<br/>\n&gt; there is nothing to do on my main and a few others<br/>\n&gt; that have just seem to be hybernating.  All 8 slots<br/>\n&gt; filled for my server.  Alt mains (as I call them):<br/>\n&gt; Yissia Hissnpounce - 27 Berserker<br/>\n&gt; Starnova Daemonhart - 29 Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Kairii Ragingfire - 25 monk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Real self<br/>\n&gt; My name is Celena but friends call me Lena.  I live<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; Virginia Beach, VA and am a 21 year old female. <br/>\n&gt; Still<br/>\n&gt; in college slowly working to my associates for<br/>\n&gt; Network<br/>\n&gt; Engineering.<br/>\n&gt; I have been into gaming since I was about 6 years<br/>\n&gt; old.<br/>\n&gt;  My dad then bought me and my brother (then 3) a<br/>\n&gt; Nintendo System.  Whoo.. we were so happy but what<br/>\n&gt; child probably wasn&#39;t to have one of those back<br/>\n&gt; then. <br/>\n&gt; I could never really pass a normal RPG game.  Came<br/>\n&gt; close to beating Mario 3 before but never succeeded.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I used to just give up on them.  I have played games<br/>\n&gt; from many systems including your table-top dice<br/>\n&gt; games.<br/>\n&gt;  When my dad got me my computer at age 14 I became<br/>\n&gt; more glued to PC games.  Never had an online game<br/>\n&gt; until after high school.  I constantly saw EQ on the<br/>\n&gt; shelf in many stores and one of my friends noticed<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; always looking at the game everytime we went to<br/>\n&gt; stores.  So xmas of 2001 I ended up with EQ trilogy<br/>\n&gt; and Luclin.  Been playing since May of 2002 (had to<br/>\n&gt; upgrade system before I could play).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now I am gonna stop blabbing and again say hello<br/>\n&gt; again<br/>\n&gt; to allof you out there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lena<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Yes, I am a ranger&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Good.  I have a task for you&quot; *whispers to the elf*<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You want me to be WHAT!!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *The Dwarf nods*<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Thats suicide!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;No I will not be your bait to that dreadful dragon!<br/>\n&gt;  Find someone else.  Like maybe a human monk.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;But we heard Dragons prefer the fear of a ranger. <br/>\n&gt; Especially an elven rangeress.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *Huntress Starnyte storms away from the village<br/>\n&gt; muttering foul words in the Feir&#39;Dal language*<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Dwarves are only good to be food to the lizardmen,<br/>\n&gt; not party members.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; New and Improved Yahoo!
