Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br/>\n  healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br/>\n  totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>\n  loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they<br/>\ncare<br/>\n  about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>\n  &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>\n  chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>\n  still loot out of turn.<br/>\n  And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>\n  When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>\n  ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>\n  picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>\nexpensive<br/>\n  item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>\n  bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>\n  for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>\n  Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>\n  What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>\n  Just wondering.<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su<br/>\n  ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>\n  people cooperate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
