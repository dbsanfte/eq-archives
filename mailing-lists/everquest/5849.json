They&#39;re bought for 2 cp each in the PoK Library. Full melee classes<br/>\nget them around 30th level, while hybrids have to wait until 51st (my main,<br/>\na ranger, is just about nearing the point where I can get his first<br/>\nDiscipline -- the Resistant Discipline, I believe, which is the one warriors<br/>\nget at 30th or 31st).<br/>\n<br/>\nDisciplines have been in the game for some time now. Someone who has been in<br/>\nthe game for a few years could probably shed more light on exactly how old<br/>\nthey are. I&#39;ve only played since January 2003, and I think they might&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen around at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have the Discipline book, you open it and learn the Discipline.<br/>\nEach Discipline has certain benefits (Resistant bumps up all your<br/>\nresistances, for instances). They last for a certain amount of time, but you<br/>\ncan only use them once every X number of hours of play. There&#39;s a window<br/>\nthat you can pull up (can&#39;t remember the command to open it up) that lets<br/>\nyou activate the Disciplines.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Su [mailto:suceress@...]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know they are for melee classes. I think you have to buy books from a<br/>\nmerchant of your class to get disciplines. I think there might be AA ones as<br/>\nwell. I don&#39;t play melee class so I don&#39;t know. Maybe a monk, rogue, or<br/>\nwarrior could shed some more light.<br/>\nSorry I can&#39;t be of more help.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.775 / Virus Database: 522 - Release Date: 08/10/2004</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
