Please!</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>Fellow EverQuest&#39;ers. I am a communications student at the \n  <br>University of Washington in Seattle, WA. For a class I&#39;m taking,<br>I \n  <br>have to write a paper about Everquest. It would REALLY help me <br>out if \n  you could fill out my survey, so I can have some material in <br>which to \n  write my paper. The survey is very short (it&#39;ll take <br>probably 2 minutes), \n  and as if it&#39;s not already obvious, I will<br>not <br>sell any of the \n  information I receive. My only desire is to pass the <br>class, and learn more \n  about other EQ players. With that said, I <br>apologize if you are seeing this \n  for a second time. I&#39;m trying to <br>get acquire as much data as possible, so \n  I&#39;ve posted this same <br>post onto various other groups. Sorry yet \n  thanks.&nbsp; <br><br>Our survey is located at: <br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sitedifference.com/edu/COM480\">http://www.sitedifference.com/edu/COM480</a> \n  . <br><br>If you would like more info on the class I&#39;m taking, the course \n  <br>website is at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/redwood/com480/\">http://faculty.washington.edu/redwood/com480/</a><br><br>Thank \n  you very much. My grade depends on you. <br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
