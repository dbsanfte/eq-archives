So, starting and stopping and restarting songs fast<br/>\nenough will allow you to have multiple song effects active all at the same<br/>\ntime.  I think 3 songs at a time is what most people try to manage.  The<br/>\nbest method I&#39;ve seen to do this is by programming a hotkey that would<br/>\nlook something like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n/pause 30;/sing 1<br/>\n/pause 30;/sing 2<br/>\n/pause 30;/sing 3<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you hit this hotkey, it would start song in spell slot 1, wait 3<br/>\nseconds, start song in spell slot 2, wait 3 seconds, then start song in<br/>\nspell slot 3.  When you notice the effects of song 1 fading, you hit the<br/>\nhot key again and it starts over.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a lvl 5 bard char which I have only played a little.  If anyone<br/>\nknows of better ways to twist songs I would like to hear them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-mac<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 5 Apr 2001 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stonemn@...\">stonemn@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I just made a bard on Tallos Zek (And I don&#39;t have to tell you how frickin<br/>\n&gt; difficult it is to get out the main gate without getting attacked) and I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; heard that you can play more than one song at a time.
