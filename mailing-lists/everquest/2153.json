I used to play everquest all the time using a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends username and password until he changed his password and never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; told me what the new one was.  I know i am about to ask a stupid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; question but is there any way that anyone would let me use their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; username and password.  I would be very greatful and i would stay off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the severs you use, and i would help you anyway that i could.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would get a username and password if i could but i dont have a credit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; card.  I&#39;m sorry if i have bothered any of you fine gamers but i just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had to ask.  and if you will let me use your username and password<br/>\n&gt; &gt; email me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you for taking the time to read this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
