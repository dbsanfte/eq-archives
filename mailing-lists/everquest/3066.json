I want to be able to go into dungeons \nfor experience instead of outdoor kiting. One of the characters I would like to \nbe is&nbsp;a paladin. I have been playing a paladin/magician duo and it seems \nreally good for dungeon play. I have been looking at necromancers, shaman and \ndruids as well. They all seem to have their strengths and weaknesses. \nPaladin/Shaman duo seems really good, as the Shaman would be like a third tank. \nThe others would go down fast when swarmed.</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
