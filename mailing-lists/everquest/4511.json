From what I have seen  the higher level spell<br/>\nyou cast that is a pet summoning spell that pet is supposed to be better<br/>\nthan its lower level equivalent.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalyburton 53Barb Shaman (Saryrn)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Justin&quot; &lt;pavisoj@...&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I have a question I know that a beastlord gets a pet at level 9.  What<br/>\nhappens when he gets the new pet at higher levels does the old one go away<br/>\nfor the new one or can he have more than one pet.  I mean if you get a new<br/>\npet spell and the old warder is powerful why would you  take a new one if<br/>\nthe old one is powerful or is the new one even more powerful?  I am starting<br/>\na beastlord on the Drinal server by the name of Jubar and Vah Shir.  any<br/>\nhelp would be appreciative.
