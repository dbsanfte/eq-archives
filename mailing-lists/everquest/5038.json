They have patched it but it still breaks, though less<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; often.  But it is fun!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want to increase your brewing cheaply just gather Payala fruit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in Shadeweaver Thicket and combine it with water.  It&#39;s a ground drop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so anyone can find it.  Just look for the blue topped trees.  It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; makes Shar Val essence, triv at 180+.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Heh. Got my brewing to 184 so far. :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A couple months ago I practiced going around the trees in the zone and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>got<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; it down so that by the time I got back to the starting point the fruit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; repopped.
