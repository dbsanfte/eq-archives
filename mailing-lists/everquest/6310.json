A few very puzzled calls later,<br/>\nwe had it changed to treating the modem as if it were any normal router, but<br/>\nstill not working right with EQ. Spent some more time with tech support and<br/>\nwe find out not only is our little modem a router in disguise, it&#39;s a<br/>\nhardware firewall also...and that aspect of it was turned on with the same<br/>\nchanges we had to make to connect. We had to turn the firewall feature off<br/>\nto be able to connect to EQ, most IRC servers, and pretty much anything<br/>\nbeyond basic email and web browsing. If you&#39;ve made any recent changes to<br/>\nyour configuration, even just a router firmware update, please look into<br/>\nthat as a possible cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you do find it&#39;s something like that, make sure you have a good<br/>\nsoftware firewall to take up the slack. I like Tiny Personal<br/>\nFirewall....very easy to configure and lives up to its name on resources.<br/>\nSygate Firewall did it&#39;s basic job extremely well before that, and was also<br/>\nextremely easy to configure, but over time got to be wickedly unstable and<br/>\nthen finally refused to play nicely with the second NIC, so it had to go.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Su &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, August 06, 2005 8:31 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: [EverQuest] New expansion Beta Open<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t even get into the normal game.
