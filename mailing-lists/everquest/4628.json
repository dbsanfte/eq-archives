But you don&#39;t necessarily have to <br/>\nget a large group or anything. I personally prefer a partner or <br/>\nsmall groups, as far as getting the most xp for your effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can I ask you guys some questions? I reckon a 1/5 bub a night is <br/>\n&gt; pretty average to aim for. That would lvl me up once a week. Is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the norm? How long did it take you in the beginning?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the beginning, first character, I&#39;d say that&#39;s about right. Once <br/>\nyou know the places to go, gaining a level per (solid)night of <br/>\nplaying is a pretty realistic goal, if you know what places to go, <br/>\nand are relatively decently geared up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have tried to solo in Black Burrow but that is well nigh <br/>\n </span></blockquote>impossible <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on your own.

Mind you, I did most of my <br/>\npre-30s leveling in the old world, before most of the expansions <br/>\ncame out:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Crushbone (orc city in Faydwer, north of the elf city Kelethin)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Estate of Unrest (kill yard trash to mid teens, then group inside <br/>\nor pull outside from 1st floor).<br/>\n<br/>\n- FIELD OF BONE (iksar newbie area)- its perfect for leveling up to <br/>\nabout 20ish, depending on the area you hunt. Over in front of <br/>\nkaesora is great for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Kurn&#39;s Tower: Esp as a paladin, when you get your vs. udnead nukes <br/>\nand/or a ghoulbane, you will ROCK against undead, and this place is <br/>\nfull of &#39;em. You can solo here, or join a small group and watch the <br/>\nexp fly by.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the English server Venril Sathir (I live in Amsterdam) and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sometimes <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the zones are completely deserted. Is it like that on the US <br/>\n </span></blockquote>servers <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on the time you play. A lot of the older servers and players <br/>\nrush off to the new expansion zones for the xp/loot there, but I <br/>\nhonestly still prefer the old world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hope to hear from some of you anyway, especially your experiences <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; feelings about EQ when you first started.
