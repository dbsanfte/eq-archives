The rats there hit<br/>\n&gt; pretty hard, but<br/>\n&gt; doable with Temp on at level 25.  Another place that<br/>\n&gt; I found, purely<br/>\n&gt; by accident, was the sarnak fort in the southwest<br/>\n&gt; part of Lake of Ill<br/>\n&gt; Omen.  There are two sarnak&#39;s at the gate, but once<br/>\n&gt; you break their<br/>\n&gt; camp, you can single pull sarnak&#39;s out of there all<br/>\n&gt; day long.  Good<br/>\n&gt; xp, decent loot (not uber, but decent) and there is<br/>\n&gt; hardly ever anyone<br/>\n&gt; else in the zone, so no competition.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Greg Burns<br/>\n&gt; &lt;freechylde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have an idea, and you may like it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; There is a little known zone, well its known but<br/>\n&gt; no body wants to go<br/>\n&gt; there cause its abit out there. With the GOD<br/>\n&gt; expansion came a zone<br/>\n&gt; called &quot;Forgotten Halls&quot;. It is adjacent to<br/>\n&gt; Jaggedpine Forrest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Its an instanced zone, so you can solo there or go<br/>\n&gt; in with 5<br/>\n&gt; friends. Go to the LDON camps and speak to the<br/>\n&gt; maguses there. Tell<br/>\n&gt; them &quot;Nedaria&#39;s Landing&quot; and you will be ported<br/>\n&gt; there. ONce in<br/>\n&gt; Nedaria&#39;s, go to the docks and find a High Elven<br/>\n&gt; Male on the docks, I<br/>\n&gt; forget his name, i think it starts with an &quot;E&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, he is wearing<br/>\n&gt; some kind of ornate tunic.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do the dialog words and you will be given access,<br/>\n&gt; much like an LDON.<br/>\n&gt; If you look at your compass, there will be a line<br/>\n&gt; marking your<br/>\n&gt; direction. Follow the line and you will enter a<br/>\n&gt; cave, where you will<br/>\n&gt; see some short chick, again her name escapes me. Do<br/>\n&gt; the dialog with<br/>\n&gt; her, and yo then have access. Click on the rock<br/>\n&gt; beside her and your in.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The nice thing about this zone, is at lower<br/>\n&gt; levels, nothing aggros<br/>\n&gt; you. In here you  kill bats, rats, or &quot;earthen<br/>\n&gt; rejects&quot;.. There is a<br/>\n&gt; bat room, a rat room, and room with a mix of bats,<br/>\n&gt; rats, and earthen<br/>\n&gt; rejects. The rejects have a little more hp and hit a<br/>\n&gt; little harder,<br/>\n&gt; but should be ok. WARNING... only attack bats,<br/>\n&gt; rats,or the earthen<br/>\n&gt; rejects. Attack anything else and the whole zone<br/>\n&gt; will unleash hell<br/>\n&gt; ipon your head.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The zone respawns quite fast, so if you go in with<br/>\n&gt; a couple people<br/>\n&gt; you will never run out of mobs to kill. It does get<br/>\n&gt; boring, but if you<br/>\n&gt; want quiet effortless killing, go here. I took my SK<br/>\n&gt; here and in about<br/>\n&gt; 3 hours, i managed to get her 2hs up from 20 to 100.<br/>\n&gt; Without a healer,<br/>\n&gt; it is tough, but was doable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The xp is quite good. If its just you, then the xp<br/>\n&gt; is close to what<br/>\n&gt; you would pick up in PC. With others, percentage<br/>\n&gt; wise it drops, but<br/>\n&gt; again, with the abundance of mobs, that shouldnt<br/>\n&gt; matter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I took both of my clerics there and now their<br/>\n&gt; offensive and<br/>\n&gt; defensive skills are maxed. Without the worry of<br/>\n&gt; aggro, its an awesome<br/>\n&gt; place. I havent tried it, but with everything<br/>\n&gt; non-aggro there, one<br/>\n&gt; could most likely fear kite in there. I.m not sure<br/>\n&gt; about quadding tho,<br/>\n&gt; dont have the cahoneys to try that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; At around level 53 or so, stuff will start to<br/>\n&gt; aggro you, so unless<br/>\n&gt; you have good crowd control, this zone is no longer<br/>\n&gt; good solo. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; BTW, there is one way in and 2 ways out. 1) gate,<br/>\n&gt; or 2) speak to the<br/>\n&gt; dude at zone in, tell him you wish to leave...and he<br/>\n&gt; will put his foot<br/>\n&gt; to ur arse and zone you out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; rickcorriveau &lt;rickcorriveau@...&gt; wrote:    I have<br/>\n&gt; a lvl 25 shaman<br/>\n&gt; and I am trying to solo but wondering if I <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  just have it wrong.
