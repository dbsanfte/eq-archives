I fell through the wall and down to zonein from the purple stairs camp in BoT. I was advised not to touch the walls in PoJ. A few people fell through walls in Ssra and ended up in the deep depths surrounded by mobs. Some of the problems are still occurring. Right now there is a bug with the lifts. I have to jump up when the lift starts to move to not have it pass through me. Or I have to be levitating. I think because EQ upgraded it&#39;s graphics engine there are still bugs to work out. I was once told how EQ did the player movement that it doesn&#39;t keep a constant watch on where you are but that it checks back every x amount of time. So sometimes the last time it checked on you, you were lower down and it then checks to see again and thinks you are lower when you should be higher and the lift is now above you so you fall through. They really need to fix that. Some people couldn&#39;t get flagged bc t<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping this will be fixed soon.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n======== <br/>\n<br/>\n    after uprading my video driver to run everquest better i now see the stars in the night sky over freeport but i didn&#39;t see the moon i saw a hazy spot is that where the moon is supposed tyo be?  also my friend keeps faling through  wall on the plane of justice is that due to the upgrade of the game?  I do find the graphics are nicer looking after the patches.  I also noticed some lag as well once the dx9 went into effect but not  as much as i ecpecxted reading all the posts.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
