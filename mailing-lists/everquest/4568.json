I did the Stein Quest twice today. Cast Illusion:DE <br/>\non my Lvl 14 Erudite Enchanter, and cast Alliance on Clurg. I conned <br/>\nClurg as Amiable both times. Both times I said &quot;What special book&quot;, <br/>\nhe replied, and I gave him the compodium. Then he said something <br/>\nlike &quot;You must have worked hard to get my book, I am indebted to you. <br/>\nI don&#39;t like being indebted, so take this as payment&quot;. He didn&#39;t give <br/>\nme anything; no PP, no stein. I petitioned the GM. Does anyone have a <br/>\nclue as to what is going on?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
