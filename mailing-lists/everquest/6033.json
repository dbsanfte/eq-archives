I managed to <br/>\nforce my hef rgr to lvl 18/19--18 is where I spend most of my time, <br/>\nbut sometimes I lvl to 19. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been recently been building my fletching skills(104). I spent <br/>\nabout 4hrs a day hunting in front of Qeynos killing green mobs for <br/>\nabout 3wks. All I make is about 150plat in the 4 hrs with no exp, but <br/>\nwhen I go hunting elswere--like bb--I only get about 5 plat for 4 hrs <br/>\nand some exp. I seem to go up about 2 skill points in that time in <br/>\nfront of Qeynos. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mean to complain, but I am starting to feel sorry for all <br/>\nknolls and gopher snakes I&#39;ve killed. Plus I would like to be able to <br/>\ndo more quests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do want to earn everything myself, but would like to know where I <br/>\ncan earn some serious plat? I have heard of people lvl 12 earning 4-<br/>\n5000 plat/hr. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do they do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
