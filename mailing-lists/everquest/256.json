And it will be nice to have possibility to make a dragon leather<br/>\n&gt;armour ( hint hint)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It will be nice to have some chests wich thiefs can picklock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fishing some other things then normal fishs, or other stramge things like<br/>\n&gt;boots with a gen in bag with a surprise big fish wich will pull you in<br/>\n&gt;water and cast summon pirana swarm on you eheheeh<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It will be nice to have a place where you can leave your goods to sell and<br/>\n&gt;where you must pass evry now and then to collect all income or it is lost<br/>\n&gt;put this place on some lost plane or limit sellers to some level range, i<br/>\n&gt;wish to buy a totem stah and all mana gain equipment but as im from europe<br/>\n&gt;and i play normaly when all servers are empty i cannot buy or sell nearly<br/>\n&gt;anything. and i play on fenin ro wich is all time full. ( hmm maybe i will<br/>\n&gt;move from rathe mountains not too much people know where this place is<br/>\n&gt;eheheheh)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It is great and wonderfull world but for now it is a little bit empty it<br/>\n&gt;needs a soul, a movement a random orc attacks on kelethim, dark elf rampage<br/>\n&gt;on freeport, dragon flying in sky in unknown direction, strange never seen<br/>\n&gt;beast in dark wood to start legends. More inteligence in program to make<br/>\n&gt;world looks more diferent so that finaly a camping is not more interesting.<br/>\n&gt;It is not need for human intervence it can be done by program if you leave<br/>\n&gt;a orc camp and in zone is many players then why not that orcs group and<br/>\n&gt;start hunting around geting items from falen (eheheh at last some money so<br/>\n&gt;bank will get some real signifikance). Other similar products will come<br/>\n&gt;soon big bad MS is preparing to enter in game on big door ( i just read a<br/>\n&gt;news on its site it will bring some interesting news) the other players are<br/>\n&gt;also on front door for bringing something new soon everquest will not be<br/>\n&gt;only game in 3d rpg town and if a game is not interesting enough when<br/>\n&gt;others come in play ? .... ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;P.S. I like this game very very much and all this critics are only in hope<br/>\n&gt;that it will give some ideas how to make it better and that i will be shure<br/>\n&gt;to play it long long time as i enjoy it now.
