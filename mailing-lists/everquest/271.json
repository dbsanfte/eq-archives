To do this go to Audio HQ and run the SoundFont program.<br/>\nFrom there go to options and ensure that your static caching is around<br/>\n10Mb or so.  It won&#39;t use it all up, it just needs to know it can load<br/>\nin a 3Mb sound font.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy SB Live! works great and I just love how the music sounds.  Very good<br/>\nsoundtrack indeed.  The 3D sound support really helps to track down<br/>\nthose pesky monsters as well.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
