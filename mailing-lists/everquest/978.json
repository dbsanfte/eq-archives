Our purpose will be to enjoy this game for all it&#39;s \n    worth -- to help each other, to teach those new to Norrath the skills they \n    will need to survive. Rules will be simple -- things such as never beg, \n    never ks, and always help your guildmate first. We will also be focused on \n    life in Norrath being more than just the battle -- other skills are given to \n    you for a reason. Want to learn how to tailor? You&#39;ve got to start with the \n    basics, and if you and a couple of guildmates want a nice quiet night, why \n    not go out together and gather spiderling silks to get going? Or get \n    together for a trip to Steamfont to pick up some supplies for smithing? <br>\n    <p>We will also be planning raids for various levels, a couple of parties... \n    and maybe even a wedding or two. ) <br>\n    <p>So if you&#39;re interested in helping us create this guild, just to have \n    fun, either leave a post here, or email to akane@... with your \n    character name, level, class and race, along with an email address where we \n    can reach you. <br>\n    <p>Look forward to hearing from you! ) <br>\n    <p>***Akane<br>Wood Elf Ranger of 13 \n    seasons</p></font></div><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com/\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n    use of Yahoo!
