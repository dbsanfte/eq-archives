I do agree very much that you shall keep your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; account safe and all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this, but in a large scale operations guild its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IMPOSSIBLE to not share<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; account with a few people that you trust. This is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; essential to day to day<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operations. You choose a couple of people who you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trust and hand them your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; info.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually it is not impossible. Sharing account info<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a way to get your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guild banned from the game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1 example. Guild property and funding. A single<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person cannot manage the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trades/funds/hand out of items for the guild. This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be a full time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for 1 person in my guild. Our solution is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; separate account shared among<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the officers with mules for cash / gems / spells /<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; items. On our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messageboard transactions take place and a member<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can ask any officer to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complete a transaction once its validated on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; board. This is clearly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the EULA but since there are no support for these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; types of operations with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; central store for a guild we have not found a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better way to handle work<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this. How do others solve these types of problems?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See, we don&#39;t keep an armory in my guild. We used to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have one but the person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who had all the stuff either stopped playing or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; switched to a different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; server so nobody could get the stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rather than having an armory, we help other members<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obtain items if we can.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We believe that people should earn the items they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get and they can either<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; buy them off of another member or we help them to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obtain it. In some cases<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; items are given to members but it all depends on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individual players and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what they like to do. We don&#39;t like begging and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to encourage it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in our guild.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
