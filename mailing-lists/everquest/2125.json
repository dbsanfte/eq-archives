Sometimes lag spikes hit and I go almost LD 5 times<br/>\nbefore the lag stops and I can continue. But that usually coincides with a<br/>\ncouple of my group members actually going LD so I&#39;m pretty sure it is a<br/>\nserver side problem. I will take a character to Rivervale later and check it<br/>\nout.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I just added the necessary memory to max out my system.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, that max is 256. I would love to go to 512 or more,<br/>\n&gt; but that would require a new system.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Things have improved with the added memory, but I still get lots of<br/>\n&gt; lag in Rivervale, and similar town type zones. My graphics card is an<br/>\n&gt; Nvidia TNT 64 (don&#39;t know what the 64 means, it is 32meg). It is the<br/>\n&gt; best I could find last year for the money I had, and more than<br/>\n&gt; adequate for the game at that time. I needed pci, so my choices were<br/>\n&gt; a bit limited. More than that, my knowledge was much less in those<br/>\n&gt; days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am curious as to what kinds of graphics cards people use, and<br/>\n&gt; whether or not they are experiencing lag in zones like Rivervale in<br/>\n&gt; spite of having a pretty good system.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone have a killer rig, and still find lag or other problems? I<br/>\n&gt; just wonder how much is the game, how much my now low end system.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
