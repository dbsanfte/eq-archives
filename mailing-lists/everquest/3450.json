I don&#39;t think they have that many hitpoints either and only get duel \nwield. Seems like a good class to solo or partner with though if you aren&#39;t into \nraiding.

I&#39;ve played \n    one to level 13 and it is ok. The beastlord himself is about as good of a \n    fighter as a bard except they can only wear leather armor. His pet is a good \n    tank though with a neat taunt proc and the beastlord has cleric level heals \n    for the pet. He also gets shaman spells too. It&#39;s a lot like a magician \n    except with more of an emphasis on healing and buffs. I don&#39;t see why the \n    beastlord pet couldn&#39;t be a main tank in a group. I kind of wish they got a \n    few extra spells though most of their best spells you don&#39;t get until level \n    59 or 60. I wish there were weak lower level versions of some of their key \n    spells like maybe a spell like the enchanter&#39;s augmentation spell that \n    increases attack speed %15 or something.</font></div><br><br><tt>Visit the \n    EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n    use of Yahoo!
