And that in the middle of a lvl<br/>\nyou are the<br/>\nstrongest. It makes sense, think about it. when do you die most often from<br/>\neasy <br/>\ncons?

I&#39;m a LVL 11 (REAL close to 12) Bard - been spending the last<br/>\n&gt; several<br/>\n&gt; levels hitting Orc an Dervish camps.  I&#39;ve been getting killed by these<br/>\n&gt; critters (mostly con blue and white) and of course the obligatory deaths<br/>\n&gt; due<br/>\n&gt; to Griffins and Sand Giants.  Last night got killed by a Ghoul in befallen<br/>\n&gt; (not sure if that is red or yellow)...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am almost to the conclusion that they use a random number generator.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes I see a significant loss (close to if not a half-bubble)<br/>\n&gt; sometimes<br/>\n&gt; it seems that I&#39;ve barely lost any.  Seems like I usually lose a lot when<br/>\n&gt; getting chomped by the super-high-level ones (Griff/SG) and often not a<br/>\n&gt; lot<br/>\n&gt; when its close to level as me (blue/white)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also - anecdotally it seems that if you die after dying recently you lose<br/>\n&gt; more for that death than otherwise.  Perhaps some sort of timer?  But of<br/>\n&gt; course - this could be coincidence - or again the random xp loss theory<br/>\n&gt; could come into play here to...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde of Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Chris_Mattos@...\">Chris_Mattos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 21, 1999 6:19 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Loosing exp when dying<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Chris_Mattos@...\">Chris_Mattos@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I brought up this subject on the Stratics EQ chat room (irc.stratics.com<br/>\n&gt; #Everquest) and it was pretty much agreed that the level of the MOB that<br/>\n&gt; kill you has, at least, some effect on experience loss.  In fact, a couple<br/>\n&gt; of the higher level players in the chat room (both of them claimed to be<br/>\n&gt; 30+) came back with an absolute YES.  The thinking is that at lower levels<br/>\n&gt; (say 6-15), the level of MOB that would probably kill you is going to be<br/>\n&gt; higher than you.  At these levels, &quot;blues&quot; are not difficult to defeat.<br/>\n&gt; At<br/>\n&gt; higher levels, MOBS than con blue to you (meaning lower level than you)<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; far more dangerous and can easily<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
