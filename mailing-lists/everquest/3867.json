Though I know how everquest works, etc. But I got <br/>\nonline and didn&#39;t have much luck getting into groups. Everyone seem to do their <br/>\nown thing and ignore me. I got to 7th level, but then go bored because I wanted to <br/>\nget into a group of people who are online at the same time, which never seem to <br/>\nhappen.<br/>\nMe coming from Australia (pacific time zone) didn&#39;t help either! lol! So given up and <br/>\nnow sticking games like Diablo 2, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway to answer your quest, to cast spell you need to click on the crystal icon <br/>\non your screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo talk to people type /say HI! or /shout , etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the concept of everquest but because none of my RL friends play makes it <br/>\nkind of waste of time for me as it is a group orientated game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nCha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jesus4metx@...\">jesus4metx@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jesus4metx@...\">jesus4metx@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone.\tI just got the game Everquest and am so confused!
