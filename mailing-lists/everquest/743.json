They organized an event that thier <br/>\nHardware could not support.  Entire servers crashing, zones crashing, random <br/>\ndisconnects, random zone teleports.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people were complaining about how hard it was to kill them and how <br/>\nthe zones were huge massacre areas, even for high lvl groups (I don&#39;t really <br/>\nhave a problem with this, a war is a war and if it is a hard one to survive <br/>\nthat&#39;s ok with me).  People were also losing tons of experience as the NPCs <br/>\nwere camped at people&#39;s bind respawn spots - (a friend of mine lost 3 bubbles <br/>\nbefore he turned off his machine to stop respawning).  We organized an army <br/>\noutside HH PASS to retake the zone - about 40 players grouped up - after <br/>\ngetting organized and planning our attack - we zone in and I disconnected (I <br/>\nassume many others did as well).  I tried to get back on for an hour, but <br/>\nsince I was now inside HH Pass, I could not log in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks VERANT!  - That was soooooo much fun<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro Wrathcaster<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
