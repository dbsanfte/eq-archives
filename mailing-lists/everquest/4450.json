Obviously, I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing \nthat if you know you have fan troubles, but after 3 days without one, I figured \n30 seconds couldn&#39;t do any more harm. And yes, that machine is still fine, with \na new fan. I don&#39;t know of ANY cpu config, even the most overclocked AMD&#39;s, that \ncould be toasted QUITE that easily. It sounds a LOT more like a short. Only time \nI ever saw anything like that was in a machine with a shorted floppy. Worked \nfine with it pulled. </font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laine@...\" title=\"laine@...\">LAINE.

Well, I got a computer this \n      way... (I know, I know...) Anyway, it arrived yesterday, but it will not \n      turn on. It&#39;s like it&#39;s not getting power. When I hit the power switch, I \n      can see the red light coming on for a sec, so SOME power is getting to \n      it.... but it won&#39;t come on. The hubby and I have taken it apart and \n      looked in it, but neither of us really knows enough about computers to \n      tell what might be wrong. </p>\n      <p>I&#39;ve emailed the ppl I got it from, but haven&#39;t heard back from them \n      yet. (I&nbsp; just emailed them last night, so I&#39;ll give them til tomorrow \n      to answer). </p>\n      <p>I know I haven&#39;t supplied a lot of info, but I was just wondering if \n      you guys could throw out some ideas of what could be causing this.</p>\n      <p>Thanks. :)</p><br><br><font color=\"purple\" face=\"Verdana\" size=\"4\">The \n      happiness you seek is right where you left it.<br></font>\n      <p><br>\n      <hr SIZE=\"1\">\n      Do you Yahoo!?<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webhosting.yahoo.com/ps/wh3/prod/\">Yahoo!
