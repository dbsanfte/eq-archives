Likewise the \namount of sheer ABUSE my LAN server gets, and the stability and speed difference \nonce the VM was fixed to reflect changes in real ram.Overall, spending $50 for a \nGeforce 2 will be an investment you&#39;re likely to be pleased with. Also, if your \npower supply is wimpy, consider invest in a bigger&nbsp;one...300 watts should \nbe plenty for a Geforce 2 and sufficient cooling for everything, but 250 will do \nthe trick with less breathing room...any less, upgrade.</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\" title=\"wulftech@...\">Wulfric \n  Rennison</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, April 09, 2003 11:17 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Re: Slow load \n  and zoning</div>\n  <div><br></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">You can try all of that stuff, but I would think \n  it&#39;s your CPU and video card that&#39;s hampering you more than anything.&nbsp; I \n  ran EQ on a PII 333mhz with an 8MB video card and 8MB accelerator while I was \n  in Japan.&nbsp; It was slow as molasses.&nbsp; No matter how many options I \n  turned off.&nbsp; I noticed moderately better performance once I upgraded the \n  video card.&nbsp; Even on my PIII 800 with 640MB of RAM itwould run everything \n  but Luclin.&nbsp; Then I upgraded the video card to 128MB and it ran \n  fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you really want to improve performance, upgrade your \n  video card if at all possible.&nbsp; It can sometimes compensate for a slower \n  processor.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n    <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apc@...\" title=\"apc@...\">apcooper</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, April 09, 2003 6:32 \n    AM</div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Re: Slow load and \n    zoning</div>\n    <div><br></div><tt>Thank you very much indeed to everyone who has responded \n    so far. I <br>have tweaked the datarate to 7.0 and switched on the caching \n    to see <br>if that makes much difference.<br><br>We have the basic New Dawn \n    with the Planes of Power expansion. The <br>Options screen however states \n    &quot;Luclin Options&quot; - I don&#39;t know why.<br><br>As for the PC - maximum RAM \n    capacity is 384MB and that is what is <br>installed.&nbsp; There is 50Gb \n    free on the hard disk. I have noticed that <br>while loading and zoning \n    however, the hard disk light is always on <br>meaning it is doing alot of \n    work. I suppose this would be the case as <br>it is loading alot from the \n    hard disk.<br><br>Performance within a zone seems fine on the whole,it is \n    just initial <br>loading and in particular the zoning times. Very often, \n    after waiting <br>5 minutes, it simply gives up and goes back to the server \n    screen - <br>very frustrating!<br><br>The only other components that could \n    be awapped are the hard disk <br>controller - but I really don&#39;t see that \n    making much difference since <br>it is working fine, and the video \n    controller - which is a nVidia Riva <br>TNT with just 16Mb RAM. We are \n    running DirectX 9.<br><br>Thanks very much again for all of your \n    suggestions, and I would be <br>grateful for anytthing else you can \n    suggest.<br><br>Best regards.<br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the \n    EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n    use of Yahoo!
