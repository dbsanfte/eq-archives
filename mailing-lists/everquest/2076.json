It was<br/>\nnot more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No problem. All of us were newbies once.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my corpse?

It can be tough sometimes getting the<br/>\nright corpse if you die more than once. And sometimes if you don&#39;t have any<br/>\nitems other than foraged food, you lose the foraged stuff anyways and just<br/>\nget back the food you started with. Up to level 5 I think you get your<br/>\nfood/drink and tome of discord back. I think your starting weapon too.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have no food,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I &gt;beg or do I start another char?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to learn which way to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>go all the time and dying, it is starting &gt;to get to me,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since the Chat<br/>\n </span></blockquote>from the game options was &gt;USELESS.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, if it bugs you that much, you can start over again. But even if you<br/>\nlose everything, at that low level you can just keep the character and just<br/>\nbuild your items and such back up again. I recommend that you not carry<br/>\nanything you really don&#39;t want to lose until you get level 6. Keep<br/>\neverything else in the bank. Especially your money. Oh, and practice<br/>\nforaging alot. It will help you later on in the game. Trust me. Begging is<br/>\nnot a good idea. Begging tend to piss people off. And you might want to<br/>\navoid orc camps at that level. at least stay close to the lift with a good<br/>\ngroup and have someone to pull wandering orc cents. I think even some orc<br/>\npawns might give you xp at that level.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>\n&gt;Rob<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re welcome.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
