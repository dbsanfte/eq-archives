I will be needing Brute hides, and so was ready to go and hunt <br/>\nthem. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never met the boat. I <br/>\ntried three times, three different shuttles, and they went out to <br/>\nTimerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the boat left. The <br/>\nshuttles just went back to BB.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick off gnolls, and <br/>\nforage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool box full of them. <br/>\nhave about eight to go. So, decided to stay there until I get the <br/>\nrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls, which I have <br/>\ntried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I want to do it the <br/>\nold-fashioned way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
