Plus I&#39;m not that aggressive about loot.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there are tradeskills as well: i sold heady kiolas to get the money for<br/>\nthe two horses i have. i takes some time to make them and it also<br/>\nmay take some days to sell them (on vendor in bazaar), but it is sort<br/>\nof easy money. the only drawback: you hate doing it! hint: never start<br/>\nto count the clicks you have to do!<br/>\n<br/>\ni fill my trader with two or three bags full of heady kiola. it takes about<br/>\n45 minutes to fill one bag, that&#39;s 10 stacks, eg 200 per bag. on tarew<br/>\nyou can set prices to 3pp to 5pp per piece. i have seen people buying<br/>\nthem off me instead from cheaper vendors, because i had many stacks,<br/>\nand not &quot;only&quot; less then 20 on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nanother item are some furs/pelts used for tradeskills or quests, for example<br/>\n in WW wolves drop a pelt, that is sold for 400pp to 600pp each. well,<br/>\nsome still ask for 1000pp for it (i believe it is used for blacksmithing).<br/>\n<br/>\ntradeskills got really complex! allakhazam has a nice feature showing<br/>\nthe full &quot;chain&quot; of items needed. for example have a look at the<br/>\nrecipe for a &quot;Fearful Darkly Pulsing Orb&quot;:<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/recipe.html?recipe=2529\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/recipe.html?recipe=2529</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthe problem is: are there people around who will by this thing?<br/>\nis it worth to &quot;hunt&quot; for some components which can be considered<br/>\nrare drops, or are off mobs in &quot;not-so-easy-zones&quot; (not everyone<br/>\ncan hunt in cazic for example).<br/>\n<br/>\nalso bazaar is somewhat &quot;ugly&quot; about prices, on the other hand<br/>\nyou also can be very lucky in there. let&#39;s go back to the example<br/>\nfrom the start: one weekend (fr to mo morning) i sold about 1500<br/>\nheady kiolas (and i couldn&#39;t click anymore), then it took about<br/>\n5 days to sell 200 again.<br/>\n<br/>\nif some says, you can get an item that sells for Xpp, you still need<br/>\nsomeone &quot;willing&quot; to buy it. also from personal experience i know<br/>\nfor some people having 500pp is very much, and other people<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if they should buy item A for 20k or item B for 30k<br/>\nand make a deal to buy both items for 40k.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen i bought my first horse (proud to be able to spent 9k) i<br/>\nwitnessed when a monk bought a 100k horse for his girlfriend.<br/>\nnice gift indeed... could really need such friends as well... ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\none more hint about bazaar: hit F9 (or was it F10) to look<br/>\nfrom above to ground. it isn&#39;t easy to &quot;navigate&quot;, but the &quot;speed&quot;<br/>\nimprovement is worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nanother hint about gfx: i only enable &quot;new models&quot; for the chars<br/>\nthat have horses. all other additional features are turned off.<br/>\nzoning is faster, and i have less &quot;gfx lag&quot;. i only have P3 systems<br/>\nwith 512MB, but that way i could play much smoother again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nooops ... i have to stop now... getting late to work, again...<br/>\n<br/>\n  - bilt<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik, lvl 57 gnome magician, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
