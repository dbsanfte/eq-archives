There is a way to prevent &quot;twinking&quot; and still have the items availible for trade, an alternative to NO DROP. Put level blocks on equipment, meaning you cannot use/wear the equipment until you are high enough level for the item, the level will be somewhere below the level you need to get it. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
