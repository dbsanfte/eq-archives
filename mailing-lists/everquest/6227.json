You can be an artisan who can go out and sample for ore and stuff with survey devices. Then you can go back and craft things. You can raise skill by doing quests where they give you the components, you craft them and give them to another npc and then you get paid for it. Dancers get tips. There are also musicians. Watching/listening to dancers and musicians gives you buffs. As an artisan you can build crafting stations, clothing, armor, weapons, houses, ships, etc. As an Entertainer (which is dancer/musician/image designer) you can play musical instruments, dance, and change people&#39;s physical appearances. I have a master image designer/furniture builder on one of the servers. On another I have a master dancer.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-06-07, 09:18:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;That is SO awesome!
