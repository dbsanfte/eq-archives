Also, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not playing the game. I can&#39;t get past the account setup.  I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t mention that I had downloaded the full version of the game a<br/>\n&gt; few days ago and got this problem then as well.  one of the things<br/>\n&gt; that I did was remove my unused 56k pci modem, then I moved my<br/>\n&gt; network card to a different slot and was able to gett into the new<br/>\n&gt; account screen. I was able to add my name and other registration<br/>\n&gt; stuff, but couldn&#39;t go any further as I had no credit card(they are<br/>\n&gt; evil) so I went to get a gamecard and when I tried to get into the<br/>\n&gt; account, it kicked me out again!! Back to square one!! I tried<br/>\n&gt; buying the game on cd and got the same issue.<br/>\n&gt; By the way I did defrag(and needed it) but to no avail.<br/>\n&gt; My big question is why can&#39;t I post at the station? I have cookies<br/>\n&gt; enabled, I&#39;m signed in and it says &quot;hi muddywag&quot; at the top, but it<br/>\n&gt; keeps telling me that I need to be registered.  AHHH! IWANNA KILL A<br/>\n&gt; BAT!!  By the way I CAN play the tutorial.  Which only served to let<br/>\n&gt; me know that I&#39;ll REALLY like this game- someday!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;The Mad Macinchaote&quot; &lt;scendera@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I had problems with EQ crashing  too...turned out to be a filthy<br/>\n&gt; and dying cpu fan.

I bought eq today along with a game card.  I installed<br/>\n&gt; it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     went to new account, and when I click it it bounces me to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     desktop.  i dried disabling my firewall, soundcard, starting<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     all unnecessary processes disabled.  uninstalled/installed<br/>\n&gt; many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     times.  checked for irq and I found that the cable modem<br/>\n&gt; network<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     cark was sharing 12 with the onboard sound, tried moving the<br/>\n&gt; network<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     card and ended up having to reactivate xp!  As it stands, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; yet<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     to set foot in Norrath.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     I registered at the Station, and tried to use the tech<br/>\n&gt; bulliten<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     board, but it won&#39;t let me post, says that I need to me a<br/>\n&gt; regisered<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     user-- I thought I was!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     anyways, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.  PLEASE HELP!!  I can&#39;t wait to<br/>\n&gt; play<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     my new game!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Dan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Your use of Yahoo!
