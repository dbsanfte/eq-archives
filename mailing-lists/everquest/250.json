I don&#39;t think they are fixing<br/>\nit because they either don&#39;t think it is a gameplay changing issue, or<br/>\nthat is how they want it.  In the long run it bennifits you becasue you<br/>\ncan put armor on your wrists and back *and still* carry a backpack,<br/>\nwrist pack and waistpack.<br/>\n<br/>\nKayo  lvl 13 monk, Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWho offers the richest group communications tools on the Internet?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAnswer:  ONElist.
