At 60 they can give you 975hp and 47AC, using 4 buff spots. \nThat is really good, not so good for epic encounters but I would certainly want \na paladin as a partner. Druids can give you 400hp and 20AC but they have regen \ncomponents(life or mana)&nbsp;added which is really nice too. Shaman can give \nyou 400hp and 27AC and 67str and 50dex. I think Paladins are the second best at \nraising hp and ac behind clerics who can give you 1100hp and 54AC, using one \nspell. Incidentally, Rangers can give you 325hp, 42AC, 4pt damage shield and \n20ATK, using 3 spells. Just for the hell of it, beastlords can give you 250hp, \n18AC, Str and&nbsp;Dex. Enchanters&nbsp;can give you 26AC. &nbsp;</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"rpreller@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rpreller@...\">Rich</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Tuesday, June 18, 2002 12:26 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] getting \n  started</div>\n  <div><br></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Let&#39;s look at this.&nbsp; I&#39;ve played most of the \n  classes into the teens, most to the lower 20&#39;s finding out grouping and \n  soloablity of each, to decide what ones I wanted to play.&nbsp; Shadowknights \n  and Paladins make good backup tanks, and main tanks.&nbsp; both get the same \n  weapon skills, as the Shadowknight is the &quot;anti-paladin&quot;.&nbsp; Both get Dual \n  Attack at level 20, which means they get a free hit from time to time.&nbsp; \n  Dual wield (1 hand weapon in each hand) is only gotten by monks, beastlords, \n  rogues, rangers, and warriors.&nbsp; as far as spells, paladins get some of \n  the cleric line of spells, including the buffs, heals, and resurrection \n  spells.&nbsp; Shadowknights get necromancer spells, and even though they are \n  powerful spells for the necro when he gets them, they just add to the power of \n  a Shadowknight.&nbsp; at level 9, the shadowknight spells are some of the \n  necro level 1 and 4 spells.&nbsp; the pet is a level 4 pet.&nbsp; throughout \n  his career, the pet an Sk has will never be much more than half his level, and \n  rarely will it be that (more easily thought of as a walking DoT).&nbsp; \n  Neither class gets the spell gate.&nbsp; </font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">for soloing and grouping, it depends upon \n  tactics, and knowing the strength and weaknesses of your class, in order to be \n  successful with either, or both.&nbsp; </font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Rich</font></div>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n    <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"suceress@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">Su</a> \n    </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, June 17, 2002 8:24 \n    PM</div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] getting \n    started</div>\n    <div><br></div><tt>Another class that might be good is shadowknight. The \n    drawbacks: Good races<br>won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want to \n    kill you. If you play a<br>darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally \n    suck but you get pretty<br>cool armor when you can manage to find all the \n    stuff you need for it. People<br>don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they \n    think of tanks. They don&#39;t often<br>invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they \n    get the spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br>The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon \n    a pet to tank for you<br>while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, \n    and you get a spell that<br>snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can \n    solo alot and are a good<br>asset to a group. Way later in the game you get \n    to summon your own horse<br>called an Unholy Steed.<br>My brother started a \n    shadowknight and got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br><br>Paladins are welcome in \n    all good cities. Don&#39;t usually have problems selling<br>to merchants. Get \n    good damage, duel wield, disarm. Are thought of as tanks<br>and can get into \n    group. Can also heal and buff. Can even resurrect. But they<br>cannot gate. \n    They can solo pretty well with a good weapon and armor. There<br>are newbie \n    paladin armor quests for humans and halfelves in freeport.<br><br>Druids, \n    not really great tanks but can snare/root and dot from afar. sucks<br>alot \n    of mana. Sometimes they can charm an animal to attack a mob for them.<br>But \n    then the animal turns and attacks them when charm wears off. They \n    can<br>also track, port, and heal.<br><br>If you like things to be more \n    difficult, there&#39;s clerics. They can pretty<br>much get into any group \n    because people always seem to want a healer. But<br>they can&#39;t really solo \n    much and have alot of downtime from medding.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br>&gt; \n    It depends on your playstyle. Solo or group, this will matter a lot \n    later,<br>&gt; the druid you can solo all the way to level60 with if you \n    want and can<br>group<br>&gt; up, but the warrior will have problems \n    crossing the road without getting<br>&gt; killed without a healer back him \n    up. But the warrior is in need in numbers<br>&gt; in the highe end raiding \n    game where the druid is an assist class.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Answer is: it \n    depends on your goals.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br>&gt; \n    From: eclipse4449 [mailto:perrenoud@...]<br>&gt; Sent: Monday, June \n    17, 2002 4:58 AM<br>&gt; To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br>&gt; Subject: \n    [EverQuest] getting started<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I choose to be a Ranger \n    right at the start, maybe a bad choice<br>&gt; because i&#39;m dying more often \n    then playing.<br>&gt; What is the best way to get started, &amp; and which \n    character is a good<br>&gt; newbie character?</tt></blockquote><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
