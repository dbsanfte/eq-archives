For your first character please do<br/>\n something simple. Once you know the game and your <br/>\n way around the game then experiement a bite.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Warriors, cleric and druids are good for you to<br/>\n learn the system with. Any of the magic users can<br/>\n be great if you have friends to be online with. <br/>\n It can be alot harder if you are alone or soloing.<br/>\n The &#39;best race&#39; depends on what you are playing.<br/>\n Humans make good warriors and not bad at others.<br/>\n several races get higher intellegence which is <br/>\n great for magic users. Actually it helps any class<br/>\n for skill advancement.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Make friends annd conteacts .. everywhere you go.<br/>\n The idea is to always having friends to run with <br/>\n and share the adventure with. Meeting people starts<br/>\n with talking and helping others. Be sure to ask if<br/>\n someone needs help before you jump in. Much as you<br/>\n want to help someone who looks like they need it be<br/>\n sure not to take someone elses kill. You will see<br/>\n people standing around someone who looks in real<br/>\n trouble .. doing nothing. Thats because they are <br/>\n waiting for the person to accept their help. Its <br/>\n also a good idea to be sure you can help before <br/>\n you jump in. jumping into a fight WAY over your<br/>\n level only gets one more person killed ..YOU.<br/>\n<br/>\n   more later ...
