I<br/>\ncould fear and had the melee dmg of my pet to kill them.  So I could get a<br/>\nnecro (who didn&#39;t need me really), a druid (Snare, heals, dots, dd), Shadow<br/>\nKnight (Darkness, melee), or a Ranger (snare, taunt for resists, sow, small<br/>\nheals but fine for healing a low hp caster).  I&#39;ve done all of them and I<br/>\nthink the Ranger was best for lowest amount of down time were able to kill<br/>\nall 3 usually before the first one spawned again.  To anyone that has hunted<br/>\nhere you know that&#39;s pretty good esp pre 50+.  Druid would run out of Mana<br/>\nto quick with the fast spawn times.  If the ranger just stayed smart and<br/>\nback off when fear wore off incase I get resisted then we would do very<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nRangers are an Enchanter&#39;s best partner in many outdoor zones.  Burning<br/>\nWoods and Cobalt Scar come to mind. The fear pathing in Cobalt Scar is nice<br/>\nand they dont run too far off.  Just hope no body is kitting those God<br/>\nforsaken Drakes.  That AoE is HUGE!<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Danspath [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danspth@...\">danspth@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 18, 2001 8:04 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Why have Rangers?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;why have a ranger at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Melee.
