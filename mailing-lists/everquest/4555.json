I got it off a bandit in <br/>\nWest Karana.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, does anyone know of any newbie quests, or any quests in general <br/>\nthat are geared towards a Erudite Enchanter? I see quests for all <br/>\nother class/races/dieties, but only 2 epic quest for level 65 Erudite <br/>\nEnchanters. I ran around for 2 months killing every black and shadow <br/>\nwolf in East Commonlands and West/North/South Karana to complete an <br/>\nArcan Order Glove quest, only to find out that it was for a Human <br/>\nEnchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep getting cool no-drop items (bandit sashes, bandit teeth, <br/>\nlion&#39;s tail, Kliknick bile sacs, etc.) that are used in quests, but I <br/>\ncan&#39;t use them :( This kinda sucks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
