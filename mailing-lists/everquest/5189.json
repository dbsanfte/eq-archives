It was a series of comic strips<br/>\nbased on EverQuest that I thought was really well done.  I had intended on<br/>\nposting the link to this list, but never did.  Now I&#39;m trying to find the<br/>\nlink again but I cant remember how or where I found it.  So I was hoping<br/>\nthat maybe someone here might know what I&#39;m talking about.  Essentially the<br/>\ncomic strip starts out with a female wood elf turning in her quest paper to<br/>\nbecome a druid, but some things happen and she ends up being taken under the<br/>\nwing (?) of an Iksar who was a friend of her father.  The Iksar character is<br/>\nnamed after the person&#39;s character who draws the strip.  Hopefully this is<br/>\nenough information that someone might recognize it and post the link.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWulfric </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
