If you&#39;re lost or need information you can ask guild<br/>\nmembers. If you need help with something you can generally find guild<br/>\nmembers who will help you. If you&#39;re hacked off about someone in group or<br/>\nthings not going your way-- maybe you can&#39;t ge into group-- you can talk to<br/>\nyour guild members. It&#39;s like an unlimited friends list and you can talk to<br/>\nall of them at once. And guild raids can be fun!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I mean I can always find someone to group with... or solo it on the blue&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; and blacks....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, but there are times when you might not have anyone to talk to. Or you<br/>\ncan&#39;t get a group. Or you need a tp or rez and can&#39;t find anyone in your<br/>\narea. Of coruse when you get higher lvl you can help lower lvl guild members<br/>\nas well. It&#39;s give and take. It&#39;s fun. At least in my experience.<br/>\nOh, and if you want to transfer something from one alt to another it&#39;s best<br/>\nto go thru a guildmember rather than a stranger.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other then maybe another aspect added to the role playing game what<br/>\n </span></blockquote>benefit<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do you recieve from a Guild.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are lots of them.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ok got to run just wondering<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok.
