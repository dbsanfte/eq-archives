Put simply, I think they&#39;re<br/>\nabsolutely priceless, tactically. I originally just had one for my druid to<br/>\nmake changing spells and medding while PLing easier, but I decided to try<br/>\none on my ranger to see how it went and I&#39;ve stayed with it from there. I&#39;m<br/>\npretty evenly split bt droggies and horses, and which sort for which style,<br/>\nmedding only or meleeing as well. I generally choose based on looks, and can<br/>\nmelee just as well from either when needed. I think it speeds things up<br/>\nimmeasurably, especially when there&#39;s no mind buffage to be had, and I can&#39;t<br/>\neven begin to count how many times I lived bc I could use the horse to<br/>\nswitch spells while being hit, or to avoid being hit in the first place from<br/>\nsit aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short...it&#39;s worth it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Melanie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snoopy66@...\">snoopy66@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, July 02, 2005 8:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Are slow horses worth getting?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When I still played, I had a cheap horse for my cleric.  They are good<br/>\n&gt; for &quot;medding while standing&quot; so you can get that heal off quicker.  But<br/>\n&gt; I rarely rode the horse.  I just sat on it while fighting.
