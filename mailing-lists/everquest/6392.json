Base damage on that is 19 <br/>\nand gives you +10 int. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of weapons you can <br/>\nfind in bazaar when you have more plat to spend, but I suggest that <br/>\nmace because it&#39;s rather cheap and sometimes people even give them away <br/>\nbecause as I said they are common and only sk&#39;s can use.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
