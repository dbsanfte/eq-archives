But now.. It just sucks.. The game I once fell in love have become an object of disgust.. :( All this &quot;camping&quot;!! Is that supposed to be the fun? First you have to stand in line before other people before your group can get the place, then you have to sit there for hours and hours, boring kills, easy kills, until you get what you want..<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat burst the bubble for me is the damn ghoulbane, I just finished camping it for 6 hours straight, we killed the spawn where lord should pop about 25 times and we didn&#39;t even see the lord ONCE, and even when he spawns, it&#39;s like 1/30 chance he has the ghoulbane.. Is this for real?? doh! I&#39;ve put over 60 hours into ghoulbane now and it&#39;s not even boring anymore, the game disgusts me.. This isn&#39;t how it&#39;s supposed to be.. And the hardest part about it is not really to kill the shin lord and what&#39;s around him, but to find a group that is willing to come with you.. Over 40 hours have I sat in the entrance to guk asking around everyone on my friends list, bypassers, even random messages to people anywhere in the game. I think I have annoyed well over 200 people with asking for help by now, and only 4 times have I managed to get a party to camp the lord, a total of 20-25 hours of real camping now..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to all you casters that say &quot;but you have holy swords&quot; when paladins complain about being weak, just SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron - Want to BUY a ghoulbane on Solusek Ro, will pay a fortune!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
