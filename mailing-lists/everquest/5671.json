I still need to download a 76mb patch, well <br/>\n150mb if you count the legends, optional zones, languages packs and <br/>\nif you click on the various zones shown on the advanced tab of the <br/>\npatch menu.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just aint right, to dowload a 76mb patch, so that you can even log <br/>\non, when GoD just came out.. and still saying EQ is playable by dial-<br/>\nup. I am not cursing Verant here, as I am a TRUE believer in EQ, just <br/>\nsaying it aint fair, see?<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I know you had to keep up with tech or you will lose out and <br/>\nnobody even care.. sigh I remember when Voodo3k and GeForce Ti 4400 <br/>\nruled the world! hehe friends kept saying I wasted buying such an <br/>\nexpensive voodoo on EQ!<br/>\n<br/>\nFew hours later, I will be able to log into Norrath, as I took the <br/>\neffort to visit a cable company and pid them to dowload the patch and <br/>\ncopy it to a cd so that I can transfer those to my pc. Rest assured <br/>\nthat the cost and time wasted alone has already exceed the sum value <br/>\nof all those expansions boxes I purchased, oops I forgot the EQ Atlas <br/>\nand Prima hint books I also grabbed.<br/>\n<br/>\nServe me right for being such loyal to EQ when I already left for 3 <br/>\nyears.. I was intrigued by this 5th Anni trial offer to come back for <br/>\na month.. and bought all the boxes, checked websites and found the 12-<br/>\nmth sub offer (WOW a bargain, and directly paid without knowing I <br/>\ncant even log in yet).. I just hope I can re-learn my skills back <br/>\nwhen im in game.. when I had lost my manastone and heard that it cost <br/>\n100-300k nowadays, no matter what folks says.. manastone really is <br/>\ngreat for a cleric and wiz, heck in fact for all caster class.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
