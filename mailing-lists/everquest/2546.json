I want the list to be friendly and fun.<br/>\nI won&#39;t make any new rules or anything unless things go sour and I have to.<br/>\nHopefully things will stay as they are.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nRock on SU........ Nice job.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure how the board has always been but I personally think it should<br/>\nbe moderated too.  Just to keep spammers, Off-topic, and unnecessary<br/>\nvulagarities off this list.  I have not seen this group abused like others I<br/>\nam on, WOW, but I think moderation keeps people longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Dunbar Keglifter<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, March 23, 2002 5:08 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [EverQuest] Bye everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi!<br/>\n<br/>\n  As a result of me quitting EQ I have handed over the ownership of this<br/>\n  mailing list to Su, she seems like a reasonable person to carry on, even<br/>\n  tho there isn&#39;t really much this list has required in the ways of<br/>\n  maintenance..
