My dad is getting me new RAM.<br/>\nHe has the same computer. And I was gonna get a friend of mine to start<br/>\nplaying EQ but now his system won&#39;t be able to handle it. I just wish things<br/>\nweren&#39;t such a hassle. But it could be worse. luv, -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Theres a difference between low end and a door stop.
