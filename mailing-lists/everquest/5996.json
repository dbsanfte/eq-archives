I have recently begun adventuring on the Morden Rasp <br/>\nserver.  Find the land of Norrath exciting and challenging.  But, I <br/>\nam at that point with my characters (28 Ranger, 18 Cleric, 18 <br/>\nEnchanter, 12 Shaman) that almost demand grouping in order to get <br/>\nanywhere (or any of the treasures!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you may have gathered I play ALOT.  If anyone would be interested <br/>\nin grouping with me, please let me know.  Char names:  Kenaf, <br/>\nMontcurie, Coro, Kitzan)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed the sudden disappearnce of guilds too.  How about <br/>\nthis...why don&#39;t we start a guild of our own?  I would even be <br/>\nwilling to start a toon on a different server if necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the group...hope to hunt with you in the near future.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
