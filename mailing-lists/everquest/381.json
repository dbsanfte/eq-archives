Does it give good enough performance to<br/>\nwarrant buying it? Also would the following system give good performance on<br/>\nEverQuest?<br/>\n<br/>\nCeleron 433<br/>\n128 MB PC100 SDRAM<br/>\nDiamond Monster MX300<br/>\nAbit BX6 Rev2<br/>\nMaxtor 10.2GB 5400 RPM<br/>\nDiamond SupraExress 56K Internal ISA<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I&#39;ve been seeing that the Cable Modems aren&#39;t that good for EQ, but I<br/>\nwas wondering how bad are they? Will they get at least better performance<br/>\nthan a 56K? Answers to any of these questions would be very appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Blizzard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
