I usually pick<br/>\noff orcs at the bottom, working the tunnel to town. It allows me to<br/>\nget a few orcs, and find a safe place to med. On the whole, a good<br/>\ncamp, with very good cash returns.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem has been claim-jumpers. As a halfling druid, I usually<br/>\nhide between hunts. Since people can&#39;t see me some don&#39;t feel<br/>\ncompelled to recognize my camp. This has not been a frequent problem,<br/>\nbut I have noticed that not being visible is a challenge to the<br/>\nlegitimacy of my camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part, I find there to be enough orcs to go around most of<br/>\nthe time. Still, to have someone complain that I am claim-jumping is a<br/>\nbit anoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually I just go bag some terrors until the interloper leaves. Or<br/>\ngets killed. Some bite off a bit too much, I am ever so sad to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
