I need to locate those spots.&quot;&nbsp;So the hard \ndrive spins and spins and spins until it&#39;s managed to store all that information \nthat could be handled elsewhere.&nbsp;Once all this is done, the information is \nstored and everyone is happy, until the video card says &quot;I need this \ninformation.&quot;&nbsp; Then the hard drive gets upset and says &quot;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m \nbusy here???&nbsp; CPU can&#39;t you do anything about this?&quot;&nbsp; And the CPU \ngrumbles and says &quot;Don&#39;t look at me man, it&#39;s the video card&#39;s problem; I just \ndo what everyone else tells me to.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the hard drive gets \naggitated and says &quot;Well if the video card would upgrade its stupid memory, it \nwouldn&#39;t have to utilize my resources to do its work.&nbsp; I got my own \nproblems!&quot;</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Then the video card said &quot;God, I wish my user would \nupgrade my memory cause it&#39;s such a pain in the ass having to deal with all \nthese unnecessary steps!&quot;</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The repetitive act of accessing the hard drive \nunnecessarily for virtual memory is called Disk Thrashing, and over a period of \ntime can cause undue wear and tear that could have otherwise been \nprevented.&nbsp; Upgrade your video card.&nbsp; Let it do the tasks so the hard \ndrive doesn&#39;t have to.&nbsp; Your hard drive won&#39;t be accessed as often thus \ngiving it another few good years of life, and you&#39;ll get better graphics \nperformance in the game.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"apc@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apc@...\">apcooper</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, April 09, 2003 1:32 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Re: Slow load and \n  zoning</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font><font face=\"Arial\"\n size=\"2\"></font><br></div><tt>Thanks again for all of the suggestions!
