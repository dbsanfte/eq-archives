I do not like to twink my characters I think the<br/>\nfun is in earning what you get not being given to you by others. So I was<br/>\njust interested in how others made $ in EQ(i.e.. selling things, helping<br/>\nhigher level PC, etc...)

I don&#39;t go around inspecting anyone.  This level 6 inspected me<br/>\n<br/>\nand then told me to inspect him.  I don&#39;t pay attention to others.  I guess <br/>\nthis person wanted to show me what his rich uncle gave him.  I don&#39;t know<br/>\nany <br/>\n16 year olds driving a BMW.  I live in the country.  You don&#39;t see many BMWs<br/>\n<br/>\nout here.  I&#39;m not in for a sad EQ life.  I enjoy it very much thank you.   <br/>\nI&#39;m not in it for an uber character.  I play to have fun.  I am not <br/>\nanti-twinkage.  My husband has a couple high characters on another account.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I could twink my enchanter out outrageously.  I choose to do it wisely. <br/>\n<br/>\nLena <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go around inspecting lower level players, you are going to find A LOT<br/>\n<br/>\nof people with great gear better than yours. I guess you&#39;re in for a sad EQ <br/>\nlife, or atleast until you understand this and get over your sadness or you <br/>\nobtain some great gear for yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nBuy low, sell high and go buy your own uber gear.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
