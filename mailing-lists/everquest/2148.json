I used to play everquest all the time using a <br/>\nfriends username and password until he changed his password and never <br/>\ntold me what the new one was.  I know i am about to ask a stupid <br/>\nquestion but is there any way that anyone would let me use their <br/>\nusername and password.  I would be very greatful and i would stay off <br/>\nof the severs you use, and i would help you anyway that i could.  I <br/>\nwould get a username and password if i could but i dont have a credit <br/>\ncard.  I&#39;m sorry if i have bothered any of you fine gamers but i just <br/>\nhad to ask.  and if you will let me use your username and password <br/>\nemail me.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for taking the time to read this.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
