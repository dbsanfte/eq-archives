That is why Verant should<br/>\nconsider all of them and try to make the system work for as many as<br/>\npossible. Even people who like upgrades may have problems with this.<br/>\nI&#39;m not talking about having a win95 OS. I&#39;m talking about people who can&#39;t<br/>\nafford to upgrade RAM or video cards. It&#39;s not as easy for everyone to get<br/>\nstuff as it might be for you.<br/>\nBesides, not getting updates is not nearly as bad as not being able to play<br/>\nthe game at all-- especially when the game was already paid for.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why should the people that want all these upgrades and great new features<br/>\n&gt; have to suffer or do with out because a select number of the so called<br/>\n&gt; &quot;value customers&quot; complain about Verant&#39;s choice to go to directx8.x? It<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not fair for the people that want to see the game grow and willing to pay<br/>\n&gt; for the &quot;simple&quot; upgrades.

But to some other<br/>\n&gt; people that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a<br/>\n&gt; rent-to-own<br/>\n&gt; basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s easy to say<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an escape for them. To<br/>\n&gt; suddenly<br/>\n&gt; not be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way<br/>\n&gt; Verant<br/>\n&gt; could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so<br/>\n&gt; financially<br/>\n&gt; stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if nothing else.<br/>\n&gt; Btw, someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap? Where was<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; again? I just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of RAM with it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; motherboard and chipset.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not<br/>\n&gt; cost that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me<br/>\n&gt; $265 after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.  The chip is<br/>\n&gt; a AMD<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Athlon 950.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
