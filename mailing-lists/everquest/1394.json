I really worked on my faction so that<br/>\neveryone conned at least dubious to me. I went into Seafarer&#39;s roost and<br/>\nmade sure to con everyone. Nobody was KOS. Most were apprehensive to<br/>\nindifferent. I went to buy from a merchant. As soon as I finished the<br/>\ntransaction something started hitting me. I turned around and couldnt&#39; see<br/>\nit anywhere. I ran from the building and soon I was dead. Even looking down<br/>\nat my corpse, whatever attacked me was not visible. I scrolled back up to<br/>\nsee what I had done to piss it off. All the thing said before attacking me<br/>\nwas &quot;How dare you!&quot;  It didn&#39;t say anything about me being a dark elf or<br/>\nwhatnot. I petitioned and the GM said that it probably attacked me thru the<br/>\nwall and promised to get back to me later after she looked into it. She<br/>\nnever did. :-(<br/>\nThe worst part was, I lost my level.. and I still haven&#39;t gotten back after<br/>\na week. I lost 3 blue bubbles of xp. :-(<br/>\nWhat do you folks think?
