I am currently <br/>\nhunting just outside the gate of Misty Thicket. I can handle about <br/>\n30% of what I meet, and with care I have not been killed lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot find my heading very well, so I am cautious going out too <br/>\nfar. At the gates are deputies to take care of the big stuff, so I <br/>\nhunt nearby. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know if there is a zone at the other side of Misty <br/>\nThicket?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow nasty do things get out there? I don&#39;t expect to take on giant <br/>\nspiders too soon, but I don&#39;t want to play too timid, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advise?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can group with other newbies for short runs, but I don&#39;t have the <br/>\ntime to get a regular group together right now. Can these short term <br/>\ngroups be very useful, or is it better to concentrate on solo stat <br/>\nbuilding?<br/>\n<br/>\nSamwiseguy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
