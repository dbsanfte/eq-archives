And I often have people ask me if I&#39;m a guy playing a girl.<br/>\nIt&#39;s rather amusing.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have both male and Female characters, mostly female but the only reason<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for me was for a bit of variety because all my characters are high elves,<br/>\nand because I usually play with all 4 main chars at once, (works out real<br/>\ngood when u can control a cleric, druid, mage and a warrior yourself i.e. no<br/>\nidiots getting you killed because they don&#39;t know what to do when everything<br/>\ngoes to buggery, even on my 56K freeserve connection (which surprised the<br/>\nhell outta me thats for sure) but I digress, the only reason I use both male<br/>\nand female models is as I said because I play high elves and since most<br/>\nraces are limited to a handful of different models male/female it can get<br/>\nhard to make them look completely different from each other especially if<br/>\nthey are all wearing the same kind of gear like DRT&#39;s and leather, robes<br/>\netc. Although I find playing a character that is the same sex as me is<br/>\neasier since I don&#39;t have to keep reminding myself what sex my char is.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Nuada (KIA)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 24th Season Elven Mage<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Druzil Ro<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
