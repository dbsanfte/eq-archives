","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-471170705\">Really, the only affordable way to acquire magic weapons is to buy them from<br/>\nother players. You can also quest some, but those are mostly higher level<br/>\nquests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen Axe of the Iron Back sell for as little as 20pp on my server,<br/>\nTarew Marr. Sometimes higher levels will even give them away. That is a<br/>\ndecent magical 2 handed slashing weapon for a lower level warrior, and I<br/>\nthink they might be bard usable as well, but not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can quest the screaming mace in Crushbone, which is a fair magical 1<br/>\nhanded blunt. I think that quest can be done at lower levels. The langseax<br/>\nquest in Halas can be done by pretty low levels too. Sometimes you get<br/>\nlangseax of the wolves (2hs warrior only) from that quest, but most times<br/>\nyou get a langseax (1hs warrior only).<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor -- 41 wood elf druid, Tarew Marr.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kaos&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaoslord@...\">kaoslord@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, March 30, 2002 1:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Newbie asking a question!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have only been playing a month and I am wondering where do you find<br/>\nmagic<br/>\n&gt; weapons in this game...My two main characters are a 11th level Barbarian<br/>\n&gt; Warrior and a 9th level Half elf Bard.....any help would be great....by<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; way plz dont say buy it from other players...I dont have much in PP&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thnx alot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
