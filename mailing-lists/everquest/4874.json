I bought one and have <br/>\nnever used it.  I am a lvl 25 ranger and just eclipsed the 100 skill <br/>\npoint mark.  You do need a flecthing kit tho.  If you want really <br/>\ngood info on how to increase your fletching rating with out spending <br/>\na ton go to eqrangers.com and click the tradeskill link.  Of course <br/>\nif you still want to purchase the book, you can do so in Surefall <br/>\nGlade.  Once you zone in from Qeynos Hills, there is a merchant <br/>\nahead and to the left next to a Ranger Guildmaster, he sells the <br/>\nbook.  Safe Travels!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
