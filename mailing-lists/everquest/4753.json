I was a bit upset when they took KEI away from lower-level <br/>\ncasters at first. But now I have learned to buff myself with my <br/>\nBreeze spell, and to find safer places to med while my mana regains. <br/>\nIt does make the game more challenging, but also make me think about <br/>\nbetter strategies. Now I am hoping to get to level 29 soon so I can <br/>\nwrite my Clarity spell. I want to sell Clarity buffs to make a bit of <br/>\nmoney to bank so I can buy my other spells (spells are quite <br/>\nexpensive as you level I have noticed). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I mean this in the nicest way possible, but if you spelled things <br/>\n&gt; correctly, it might help your case a little more. I&#39;m not trying to <br/>\n&gt; insult you, but if I were someone working for Sony and I saw the <br/>\n&gt; spelling errors in this I would assume that you were either a child <br/>\n&gt; or that you didn&#39;t really care enough about the message to use <br/>\n&gt; correct spelling.<br/>\n&gt; A few things to point out: the correct spelling is Verant. However <br/>\n&gt; Verant no longer has anything to do with Everquest. Quitting is the <br/>\n&gt; correct spelling. Meditating, Originally, Having, Minutes, <br/>\nAvailable, <br/>\n&gt; Appreciate and so forth. Spellcheck can run a long ways.<br/>\n&gt; I hope you don&#39;t use &quot;horse shit&quot; as an expression in your letter.<br/>\n&gt; That said, I can understand why they &quot;nerfed&quot; C2 and C3. It made it <br/>\n&gt; harder for lower level enchanters to compete with higher level <br/>\n&gt; enchanters in selling their buffs, and it made fighting less <br/>\n&gt; challenging for lower level characters than the creators had <br/>\n&gt; intended. Basically, players became so dependent on the buffs that <br/>\n&gt; they did not learn how to conserve mana and play the characters in <br/>\na <br/>\n&gt; manner the creators had intended.<br/>\n&gt; It did not take the fun out of the game. There are still many <br/>\nthings <br/>\n&gt; to enjoy. Some of the changes have made the game more exciting. <br/>\nThey <br/>\n&gt; have also added new quests for lower level characters and added <br/>\nsome <br/>\n&gt; features to make things easier for new characters that are just <br/>\n&gt; starting out.<br/>\n&gt; Some examples: When I first started out if you were low level and <br/>\nyou <br/>\n&gt; died you had a short period of time to get your corpse back. If you <br/>\n&gt; did not you lost it and all of your gear. And you lost xp even at <br/>\n&gt; level 6. Now you don&#39;t lose your corpse or xp until level 10.<br/>\n&gt; There is a feedback system you can use and you can email customer <br/>\n&gt; service. I think that quitting EverQuest over a few changes is a <br/>\nbit <br/>\n&gt; extreme. But I guess what it comes down to is your enjoyment of the <br/>\n&gt; game. If you no longer enjoy it, then you do not have to play.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Connor Shi&#39;do&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;salior_andromeda@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DUe to the frequent changes sony/varent has induced into this <br/>\ngame <br/>\n&gt; &gt; such as revamping some perfectly fine zones and make them harder <br/>\n&gt; than <br/>\n&gt; &gt; orginaly, and swiping c3 and even c2 from our collective grasp, <br/>\nmy <br/>\n&gt; &gt; famley members who play this game will be writing sony and they <br/>\n&gt; will <br/>\n&gt; &gt; shortly and most likely <br/>\n&gt; &gt; be quiting this game, which in effect may lead to my defection as <br/>\n&gt; &gt; well due to the incressing dificulty of this so call &quot;class <br/>\n&gt; balancing&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now mind you this is total horse shit on sonys part, and they are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking all the fun and adventur out of this game by making every <br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing totaly impossible and un reachable, now i know not every <br/>\none <br/>\n&gt; &gt; feels like this but not every one is a druid who with out c3 can <br/>\n&gt; &gt; cast no more that 3 spells with out haveing to sit for 20 minets <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; meddititing for example<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What im asking my fellow everquest players and there friends is <br/>\nfor <br/>\n&gt; &gt; there suport in the effort we are trying to get sony to see, that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; they are systematicly desimating a game that once was fun and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; enjoyable.
