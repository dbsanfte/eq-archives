While it is true that<br/>\n&gt; Rangers don&#39;t have the hitpoints of Paladins,<br/>\n&gt; Shadowknights, and Warriors (even with the same gear<br/>\n&gt; and stats).  You have to keep in mind, that Rangers<br/>\n&gt; are not tanks (well, at least not post 25ish), but<br/>\n&gt; are more in the line of a light offensive class,<br/>\n&gt; with excellent agro control.  It is true that they<br/>\n&gt; do not have as high of an AC as a pure tank, Pally,<br/>\n&gt; or SK, due to the fact that there is very little in<br/>\n&gt; the way of plate armor that they can wear.  As far<br/>\n&gt; as soloability, they are the most efficient melee<br/>\n&gt; based class for soloing, even prior to getting panic<br/>\n&gt; animal at 22.  I know this is true, as other than<br/>\n&gt; from 12 to 15, and 21 to 25, I have just about<br/>\n&gt; exclusively soloed mine (and very little of it has<br/>\n&gt; been on animals).  I&#39;ve even grouped with a higher<br/>\n&gt; level Ogre warrior (i was 40, he was 45), and peeled<br/>\n&gt; the mob off of him for a time, due to the healer<br/>\n&gt; being lom, and held it til the ogre got healed.  If<br/>\n&gt; The Ranger in your group is dying a lot, then one<br/>\n&gt; (or more) of several things is true:  either the MT<br/>\n&gt; is not doing his job with damage and taunt, the<br/>\n&gt; ranger is not doing efficient agro control, the<br/>\n&gt; healer is not keeping up with the damage done, or<br/>\n&gt; the ranger has not focused as much on AC as he/she<br/>\n&gt; should have.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rich<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Louis Gumaer <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, June 17, 2002 8:05 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EverQuest] getting started<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Yeah they seem like they would be really good in<br/>\n&gt; the high end game.

While htey<br/>\n&gt; are group dependant until<br/>\n&gt;     they get Panic Animal at 22, they are excellent<br/>\n&gt; characters in teh high end<br/>\n&gt;     game.  There aren&#39;t too many classes that can do<br/>\n&gt; the damage they can AND<br/>\n&gt;     still be able to control aggro as well they do. <br/>\n&gt; And they are the masters of<br/>\n&gt;     outdoor pulling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; There are characters that you use for the high<br/>\n&gt; end game, and characters<br/>\n&gt;     used<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; just for fooling around and making money, and<br/>\n&gt; characters used for their<br/>\n&gt;     sheer power.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     And well, any class can fill any of these roles.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Visit the EverQuest homepage at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Your use of Yahoo!
