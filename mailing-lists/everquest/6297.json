The FTP site for downloading the patcher \nis listed below. There may be a lot of data to download, so please be \npatient.&nbsp; You should run this patcher before you log in, every time.&nbsp; \nFailing to do so may cause you to experience crashes or gameplay issues that \ncould be fixed just by patching.</font><br></font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size=\"3\">You may \ndownload the Depths of Darkhollow beta patcher at the following FTP \nsite</font></font></font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\"\n size=\"3\"></font></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\"\n size=\"3\"></font></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">FTP Site \nomitted due to NDA.</font></font></div>\n<div><br><br><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">To get to the ftp \nsite:<br><br>Enter the ftp address into your Internet Explorer web \nbrowser.&nbsp; It will bring you to the ftp site. The file you need is called \nEQBetaPatcher.zip.&nbsp; Just right click on the file and copy it to your \ndesktop.&nbsp; Unzip the file and copy betaeverquest.exe into your root \nEverQuest directory (Should be in C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Sony&#92;EverQuest unless you \nchanged your default installation.)<br><br>Run this every time prior to logging \nin to the beta server. You will see the Beta Server on the server list, choose \nthat server and log in.<br><br><br>HOW LONG IS BETA?<br><br>The beta test is \nscheduled to begin on July 20th, 2005 and is scheduled to end on September 13th, \n2005, unless we decide to change these dates.<br><br><br>HOW DO I GET TO THE DoD \nZONES?<br><br>When you get onto the beta server, create your character and head \nto the Plane of Knowledge. Find Old Man Thorren and he can teleport you to \nCorathus Creep.<br><br><br>HOW DO I COPY MY CHARACTER ONTO BETA?<br><br>For us \nto copy your favorite EverQuest character to the beta server, please indicate \nwhich character you want us to copy by logging into your play server as your \nfavorite character. You indicate that you want us to copy an individual \ncharacter by typing the command /beta in your chat window. Periodically we will \nrun scripts that will copy characters to the beta server. Keep in mind that we \nwill be running the character copies on an as-needed basis - not necessarily at \nregular intervals. It may take several days for us to copy your \ncharacter.<br><br><br>THE /betabuff COMMAND<br><br>The level range needed to \ntest all of the variations of dungeons for&nbsp; DoD is huge.&nbsp; In order to \ngive you that ability to test as much of the expansion as possible, we have \ncreated a /betabuff command.&nbsp; Here&#39;s how you use it.<br><br>1. Create a \nfirst level character on the beta server and log in with that character (this \ncommand will only work on 1st level characters).<br><br>2. Type /betabuff CLASS \nLEVEL - where CLASS is the class of the character you would like to create, and \nLEVEL is the level that you want that character to be.&nbsp; LEVEL can only be \nnumbers divisible by 5, starting at 20.&nbsp; So 20, 25, 30, etc.<br><br>That&#39;s \nit.&nbsp; The character you created will be transformed into a character of the \nlevel and class you have chosen.&nbsp; Your race and even gender may change as \nwell.<br><br><br>BETA FEEDBACK<br><br>There are two methods for passing \ninformation to us about what you experience during the beta.<br><br>/bug should \nbe used to report bugs.&nbsp; Bugs are gameplay features that do not work, \nspelling errors, and anything that just does not work as intended.&nbsp; Please \ngive us as much detail about the bug as you can think of when reporting \nit.<br><br>/feedback should be used to send in comments about parts of the \nexpansion that work properly, but that you would like to see changed.&nbsp; If \nyou discover an item that you think should have less Wis and more Int, then use \n/feedback.&nbsp; If you think a certain encounter is too easy or too hard, use \n/feedback to report it.<br><br>It is important that you distinguish between \nthese two options, as one is read primarily by our testing team and the other is \nread mostly by our game designers.&nbsp; Sending a bug through /feedback can \ndelay our ability to fix it, since we&#39;ll have to route that to our testers for \nverification.<br><br>Please use this command to explore as many of the \nadventures as you can and report your findings to us.<br><br>If you find \nyourself in dire need of assistance, you can use /petition to contact us for \nhelp.&nbsp; Please only petition if the situation is one that you can&#39;t correct \nyourself.&nbsp; For example, if you used /betabuff to create a character and you \nhave lost the corpse, there is no need to /petition.&nbsp; You can just log out, \ncreate a new character and use the /betabuff command again.<br><br>Please \nremember that your participation in the beta program is subject to the Terms of \nUse, License and Non-Disclosure Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) which you have already \nagreed to. Your access in and to the beta program, including the patcher, is for \nyour personal, non-commercial use only, in accordance with the Agreement, and \nany feedback you provide is confidential.<br><br>Thank you for your time and \neffort; we appreciate your help testing this \nexpansion.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br><br>The EverQuest Depths of Darkhollow \nDevelopment Team</font><br></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
