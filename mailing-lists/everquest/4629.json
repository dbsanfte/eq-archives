You<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solo or do a derv or orc group.

I am in AWE of you people even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; though I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understand half of what you say. I long for the<br/>\n&gt; day<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when I can talk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the finer ponts of EQ like you guys.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For the moment I have a love/hate relationship<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; EQ after playing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for about two months or so. Its a type of game I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experienced before - I am totally fascinated and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mildly (well, at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moment!) addicted. The game boths thrills and<br/>\n&gt; scares<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me. I find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself nervously approaching the PC every night<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mentally preparing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself for the dangers ahead. Once I&#39;m in, I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; immersed. GET THAT<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; LEVEL UP is my only goal.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When I levelled 10 I knew that I was going to<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to deal with REAL<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dying and corpse retrieval. Boy, that was - and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still is  - a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learning experience. The first few times I got<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; depressed that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vowed to give up and cancel my subscription. But<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crawled to lvl 11<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and am much more careful about conning.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By nature I am not a team player so grouping is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still a bit alien to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me although I realise its the only fast way to<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; xp. But too often<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I find myself in groups that just gung ho for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything in sight<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hitting anything that moves (= Excelsis having<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; retrive his corpse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ONCE more in some weird, out of the way loc).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Can I ask you guys some questions? I reckon a<br/>\n&gt; 1/5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bub a night is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pretty average to aim for. That would lvl me up<br/>\n&gt; once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a week. Is that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the norm? How long did it take you in the<br/>\n&gt; beginning?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have tried to solo in Black Burrow but that is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well nigh impossible<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on your own. Grouping is the only way but I HATE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that place so much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it makes me so nervous to go there. I am soloing<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; West Kerana but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grizzly and giant spider spawns are pretty rare<br/>\n&gt; so I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spend a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time hanging around and trying to avoid the<br/>\n&gt; bandits<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (by the way, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be walking all over WK recently,  not<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; around their huts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this new?)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any advice and encouragement you can give me is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know I&#39;m not alone, but sometimes it feels as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; though I am! I use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the English server Venril Sathir (I live in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Amsterdam) and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the zones are completely deserted. Is it like<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the US servers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as well?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope to hear from some of you anyway, especially<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your experiences and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feelings about EQ when you first started. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again now to that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HUGE VAST world that we all know and love (and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes hate...)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Excelsis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Erudite Paladin 11<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The New Yahoo!
