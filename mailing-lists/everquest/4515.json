It&#39;s a low hp dumb pet that hits for ~70.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also have an aa skill that summons sword onto a target in the samy way<br/>\nthat the flaming sowrd of xuzl does.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth solutions are low hp dumb pets and dies with the target.

Mage(?) whatever <br/>\n&gt; you are only<br/>\n&gt; allowed one pet at a time.  From what I have seen  the higher <br/>\n&gt; level spell<br/>\n&gt; you cast that is a pet summoning spell that pet is supposed <br/>\n&gt; to be better<br/>\n&gt; than its lower level equivalent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>do wizzies get a pet they can use in combat? my wizzy is<br/>\nonly 51 and the two familiars she has are only a &quot;visible buff&quot;. and i<br/>\ndidn&#39;t check for the later spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso i think clerics get sort of an pet: the &quot;animated&quot; hammer... but i<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if you can count it as a pet :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nas a chanter you have two kinds of pets: the animations<br/>\nand charmed mobs. you can&#39;t have both of them at the same time... only one<br/>\npet.<br/>\n<br/>\nnecros and mages (as the main pet users) can only have<br/>\none pet at a time... (verant introduced a bug after a<br/>\npatch some time ago, where you could have more pets, but<br/>\nthey &quot;fixed&quot; it within 30 minutes :-((().<br/>\n<br/>\nmages can also get a &quot;planar ability&quot; at 63 named<br/>\n&quot;Host of Elements&quot;: this is the only way to &quot;summon&quot;<br/>\nmore than one elemental at a time (3 ranks availible<br/>\nsummoning 5, 7, or 9 elements for 30 seconds, reuse<br/>\ntime is 22 minutes).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nabout the strength of pets (and i can only speak for<br/>\nmages, necros, chanters): yes, they get better until<br/>\n50... the pets after 50 get tricky sometimes. i think<br/>\nthe problems were introduced by adding the expansions.<br/>\nfirst the max level was 50 and verant said they will<br/>\nnever raise that limit. then they added 51 to 60 and<br/>\nrecently 61 to 65.<br/>\n<br/>\nthis leads to different situations: in &quot;old world&quot; zones<br/>\nit is possible to hunt mob with 2 people that needed a<br/>\nraid force in the old days (phinny for example). and<br/>\nsome of the newer zones are much tougher than the old ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nso especially as a mage, you have to know when to use<br/>\nwhich pet... if you use a pet at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\njust some thoughts... ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik, lvl 57 gnome magician, Tarew Marr<br/>\n    charachters listing:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://muog.de/chars.html\">http://muog.de/chars.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
