Often, \n  the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br>&gt; healer and am \n  expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br>&gt; totally \n  screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br>&gt; \n  loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All \n  they<br>care<br>&gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people \n  partake in<br>&gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody \n  else gets a<br>&gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order \n  some people will<br>&gt; still loot out of turn.<br>&gt; And then we have \n  times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br>&gt; When I first \n  joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br>&gt; \n  ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br>&gt; \n  picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s \n  an<br>expensive<br>&gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So \n  later he picked up a<br>&gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. \n  He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br>&gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br>&gt; Has anyone else \n  had this problem?<br>&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot \n  order?<br>&gt; Just wondering.<br>&gt; luv,<br>&gt; -Su<br>&gt; ps. alpha loot \n  with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br>&gt; people \n  cooperate.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  Your use of Yahoo!
