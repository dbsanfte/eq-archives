I guess","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1698723936\">No. NPCs can KS from you no matter how much damage you did to the enemy. If<br/>\nthe critter you are fighting is slain by an NPC you get no credit for it. I<br/>\nguess they think that people would get lazy and have guards finish off the<br/>\ncreatures and that would be &quot;unfair&quot;.<br/>\nOnce I was fighting something and I managed to deliver the last blow even<br/>\nthough the guards had been hitting it and I still got xp. But sometimes if<br/>\nthe guards participate at all I get no xp. I think it&#39;s sort of buggy.<br/>\nHowever, I think that you *should* get xp if you did more than 50% of the<br/>\ndamage. I have lost so many kills to guards bc the enemies ran to them to<br/>\nescape from me. It&#39;s just stupid. I once nearly got killed and had an npc<br/>\ndown to about 5 hp. I was running after it hitting it desperately trying to<br/>\nkill it before it got to the guards. Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t fast enough. The<br/>\nguards got the last 5HP of damage and stole my kill. It was very<br/>\nfrustrating.<br/>\nI actually submitted a complaint in /feedback.<br/>\nI suggest you do the same.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; When you&#39;re fighting something, and you&#39;re so close to killing it, and a<br/>\n&gt; guard or whatever comes along and deals the last blow, kills it, and it<br/>\n&gt; vanishes....does that count like it killed it from beginning to end?<br/>\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t it count if you do more than 50% of the damage to the critter?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
