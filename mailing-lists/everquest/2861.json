Mike is right, you really need to decide on what and HOW you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1475485544\">Talk about questions no one likes to answer.......<br/>\nReason is there is no right answer........<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT.<br/>\nMike is right, you really need to decide on what and<br/>\nHOW you will play.....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe books say there are only tanks and casters so<br/>\nfirst and foremost you need to decide on what you<br/>\nPREFER to be as your main, ever enjoying to play,<br/>\ncharacter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you can ask yourself if you would like to solo or<br/>\ngroup often.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor servers you should sort by population and pick one<br/>\nwhere you think you would be best, like less lag, less<br/>\ncamping, would mean a less populated..... more to sell<br/>\nto, more to trade with, etc....would mean a higher<br/>\npopulated server.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing is if you find someone who also plays<br/>\nto try and play on that server.  I got four people I<br/>\nknow into the game and we are all on the same one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are some basic questions you should ask yourself<br/>\nand then create one and have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some suggestions that I personally used as a<br/>\nstarting point to help decide.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue Casters........<br/>\nWizard<br/>\nEnchanter<br/>\nShaman<br/>\nDruid<br/>\nCleric<br/>\nNecromancer<br/>\nMage<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue Hybrids<br/>\nShadowKnight<br/>\nRanger<br/>\nPaladin<br/>\nBeastlord<br/>\nBARD<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue Tanks<br/>\nWarrior<br/>\nMonk<br/>\nBeastlord<br/>\nRogue<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: I may have missed a few and these are my tastes<br/>\nand where I chose to pick them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play a Druid, Ranger and Mage just because I like<br/>\nthe flavor of all three and I can also swap depending<br/>\non what my friends are playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome more hints:<br/>\nIf you love grouping and being and meeting others a<br/>\ncleric is a NEEDED char in any group.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids are cool because you can solo and group and get<br/>\nsome popular spells like Spirit of the Wolf.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanters get the most spells in the game, wizards<br/>\nhave the most powerful spells, mages have cool spells<br/>\nbut also get the most powerful pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nRangers get track which lets you choose what creature<br/>\nyou want to kill or pull<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins........think if King Arthur type stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards....get some very nice stuff too and are good for<br/>\ngroups......requires a knack to twist the songs<br/>\nthough....you can read about twisting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell enough ranting......and yes all this is open for<br/>\nopinion but the fundamentals should be addressed to<br/>\nget you thinking along the lines you will be happy<br/>\nwith.<br/>\n<br/>\nHEY and if all else fails....make 2 chars and after a<br/>\nlittle playing decide on what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nNever be afraid to ask for help.......most players are<br/>\nhelpful and enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\nDruzzil RO  (server)<br/>\nFahzel  Druid<br/>\nHallucian   Mage<br/>\nMiali       Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;LAINE.
