If your corpse had nothing on it, it may have \n  <br>disappeared, but your own anwswer is most likely. You misplaced your \n  <br>corpse. Dying at levels below five is set to be low-penalty (you lose \n  <br>very little and get food and water when you come back) to make the \n  <br>early learning a bit easier.<br><br>There are tools to find corpses, sold \n  by merchants. However, it is <br>best to learn to die with finding your corpse \n  in mind. Try to look <br>around at landmarks when death is clearly coming. Try \n  to be near some <br>object you can find easily when you come back. And unless \n  you don&#39;t <br>mind having to do this often, learn to fight in such a way as to \n  <br>seldom die. Some gamers like to take the risks leading to frequent \n  <br>deaths, but I prefer to hunt with care and die seldom. Seems more in \n  <br>the spirit of the game to me.<br><br>Good hunting to you.<br><br>Barto \n  Proudfoot<br><br>If --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Minigamer&quot; &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; \n  wrote:<br>&gt; Hi all,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie \n  had a 4th level Druid in the <br>city of Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, \n  with others, I got <br>killed by an Orc Centurian and when I returned to get \n  my corpse, <br>nothing was there.&nbsp; It was not more than 4 minutes when I \n  returned.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or \n  Loot my corpse? <br>The book says no but I beg to differ.<br>&gt; Is it \n  possible that I had two corpses out there?
