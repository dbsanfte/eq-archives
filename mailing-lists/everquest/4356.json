I asked /ooc if they looked even remotely like<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; city (to people who had been exploring) and was told &quot;No&quot;. And then they<br/>\n&gt; sold that map booklet that is almost useless. Especially with some of the<br/>\n&gt; errors. Like having A B C D E listed on the map but only A B C D defined.<br/>\nSo<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s this zone that&#39;s marked but not defined... The person who did EQ<br/>\n&gt; Atlas did a MUCH better job at maps. His maps are much much more useful. I<br/>\n&gt; really wish he hadn&#39;t gotten screwed on the map book thingy. I would&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; payed for a book with his maps over the one Sony put out. I still think it<br/>\n&gt; would be cool if he made a book and had fold out maps and such. Ones that<br/>\n&gt; are large enough to mark things on as notes to yourself. So you can look<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; them ingame and out of game.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.459 / Virus Database: 258 - Release Date: 2/25/2003 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
