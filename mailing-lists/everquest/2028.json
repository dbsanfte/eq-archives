I can guarantee","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-603177067\">As a paying customer, I do not want EQ to just survive. I want EQ to strive<br/>\nto be the best game available. No one wants to play a so-so game. I can<br/>\nguarantee you, EQ would not be afloat if they had not made any or even a few<br/>\nof the upgrades / expansions they have done. I would hate to think of 3<br/>\nyears of EQ with no upgrades or expansions. Do you honestly think EQ would<br/>\nstill be played to today if it were still the original EQ of 3 years ago?<br/>\nNOWAY ! EQ would be around right now. But since Verant choose to continue to<br/>\ngrow, they still have a strong player base. Sure, some might quit due to the<br/>\nnew requirements, but it is better than being out of business if they&#39;d sat<br/>\non their ass and count the money for the first 1 year. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank God Su was not a VP at Verant at the time of EverQuest release or we&#39;d<br/>\nbe lining up to kill Vox and Naggy for the 1,000,000th time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really want Verant to waste my $9.95 a month trying to figure out a<br/>\nway for DirectX8 to work on your 8 MB video card or your neighbors WIN95<br/>\nsystem. I hope they spend my monthly service fee making the game better. I<br/>\nhope they keep upgrading the EQ world. You notice, this is the exact<br/>\nopposite things you want. Change is good when it comes in the form of an<br/>\nupgrade :-) I think that for every person that quits EQ because of the new<br/>\nrequirements, they keep 2 people playing for months longer by making the<br/>\nmore enjoyable. People will and do quit after doing everything there is to<br/>\ndo in EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is crazy for people to think that a company should hold back and try not<br/>\nto be the best game out on the market. As time goes on the bar that games<br/>\nget measured on will continue to grow. As it grows, new requirements are not<br/>\nan option, but a necessity, a must. Once Verant knew the release of DirectX<br/>\n8, they knew that they MUST use DirectX8 if they wanted to continue to move<br/>\nforward and strive to be the best game out on the market. As a paying<br/>\ncustomer, (some paying more than others) you would have to be crazy not to<br/>\nwant the same thing. I love the new graphics and sure, I had to do some<br/>\nupgrading, but damn, look at the zones today compared to 3 years ago, what a<br/>\nchange. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess you really don&#39;t understand Su, these changes are really not for the<br/>\nfun of it or for show. They are a must. The vast majority of Verant&#39;s<br/>\ncustomer base demands that Verant provides the best game possible. The best<br/>\ngraphics, the best detail, the best way to interact with the fellow players,<br/>\nthe best dynamic role playing world and the best customer service. Do I<br/>\nthink Verant is the best at all these? No, but atleast I know they are<br/>\nstriving to be the best. Verant knew that without DirectX8, they couldn&#39;t be<br/>\nthe best for long. As time goes on, all the best games will be running the<br/>\ncurrent DirectX. <br/>\n<br/>\nSoL left 2 out 3 of my household computers unplayable. My son, who also<br/>\nplays EQ, doesn&#39;t have a playable computer now. Even though Verant might<br/>\nhave released SoL a little early and untested, I am happy they released when<br/>\nthey did, just before Christmas. Perfect timing for the many people that<br/>\nwill ask their parents, spouses, grandparents, aunts and uncles ( Mu, Chase<br/>\nneeds another stick of RAM for Christmas ) for their upgrades. Computers get<br/>\noutdated just like games do and if expect to play the most popular games,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have to keep your machine updated. Just be thankful computer<br/>\ncomponents are cheep. I still feel like crying when I think about the money<br/>\nI spent on my computer I bought in 1993 or 94. Pakard Bell system for<br/>\n$3,400. WOW what I could do with that money today.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question you should ask yourself is, do you want to play the best game<br/>\navailable or do you want to play just a so-so game. Maybe Verant is not the<br/>\ncompany for you, but they&#39;re the company for me, they keep pushing the<br/>\nenvelope. As long as I choose to spend my &quot;relaxing&quot; free time in the world<br/>\nof EverQuest, I pray that Verant will continue to strive to be the best,<br/>\neven if this means an upgrade here or there, I&#39;ll be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy no means is this an insult on you Su, I just really don&#39;t see your view<br/>\npoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, this email is so long.
