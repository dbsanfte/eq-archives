For a minute there  you had me scared!  I in NO way<br/>\nintended to imply favoritism (though one of my friends claims I was<br/>\njust &quot;smiled upon by the Gods&quot; and my husband was not &lt;G&gt;).  However,<br/>\nas you mentioned, I wouldn&#39;t put it completely past them.  I have even<br/>\nheard rumor (strictly hearsay) that Verant at first  had no intention<br/>\nof having the armor &quot;show&quot; on female characters....  So the guys down<br/>\nin the design and programming department may have a<br/>\nfew...preferences...they&#39;re entertaining. &lt;bg&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...Now that you mention it, I may have to create two new<br/>\nmale/female characters with identical stats just to see what<br/>\nhappens... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLliani<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 4 Nov 1999 18:06:35 -0800, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Steve Graham&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sdgraham@...\">sdgraham@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;i think the biggest point here is that as far as she can tell, the<br/>\n&gt;characters are matched except for gender.  wouldn&#39;t it be one sick joke if<br/>\n&gt;Verant had been nerfing the genders differently all along so that the female<br/>\n&gt;is easier to play than her male equivalent?  this would definitely<br/>\n&gt;demonstrate an evil intent by Verant to undermind the family unit and i<br/>\n&gt;would have to report them to the appropriate conservative left wing<br/>\n&gt;factions....just kidding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;really wouldn&#39;t put it past them though...seriously </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
