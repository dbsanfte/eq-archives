Sure having Ykesha might help,<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s required. That is something I will have to look<br/>\ninto.<br/>\n(I would have replied sooner but for some reason my account started bouncing<br/>\nemails and yahoo wouldn&#39;t let me send stuff)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I am seriously thinking about getting this. I agree on the opening<br/>\n&gt; and bashing of chests and things. Other games I&#39;ve played, it&#39;s kinda<br/>\n&gt; fun finding new treasures in chests and when I find a chest in EQ I<br/>\n&gt; want to bash it then remember I can&#39;t LOL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think that the private space will be cool! My help some of the<br/>\n&gt; lower-level players (such as myself) level a little faster without<br/>\n&gt; getting accused of Ks&#39;ing :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The EQ site mentioned LoY Broken Skull was the starting point of this<br/>\n&gt; new expansion. Does anyone know if I need to purchase LoY first<br/>\n&gt; before I can buy the new expansion?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, another expansion pack is coming out.
