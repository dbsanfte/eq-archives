If you or anyone is <br/>\n&gt; on Stromm and needs some help or is looking to make friends just send <br/>\n&gt; an ingame /tell to Karrola 70 beastlord. I also am co-leader of a <br/>\n&gt; friendship based guild on stromm and we can help you learn the game and <br/>\n&gt; get some basic gear to start with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Moya&quot; &lt;laffys@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well wanted to say hello to all.

One more thing, I wanted to know how I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; look for local Everquest groups. I live in Brooksville, FL. So if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone has any ideas, please let me know.
