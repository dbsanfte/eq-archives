I went to login<br/>\n&gt; to check my email <br/>\n&gt; &gt;and apparently for no reason my account was shut<br/>\n&gt; off. I have no idea <br/>\n&gt; &gt;why. Well, I have an idea and it might be the same<br/>\n&gt; fuck up as with <br/>\n&gt; &gt;my brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to<br/>\n&gt; decide whether or not <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I want to bother renewing because they will<br/>\n&gt; probably charge me a <br/>\n&gt; &gt;higher price. I had a 3 year subscription dammit.<br/>\n&gt; It just pisses me <br/>\n&gt; &gt;off that they pulled this with me.
