Once you do that if you left-click (?) on the spellbook icon it will bring up a little window where you can save your spellsets. I had to redo all of mine as well. The same goes for hotbuttons, you will have to recreate all of those as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe servers are bieng merged mostly due to the amount of players on each one. I was originally on Sol Ro and now on Bristlebane and on Sol Ro there were very few players there before the merge. Granted the decrease of lag in PoK and the bazaar was really nice but the lack of others to play with wasn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!<br/>\nDurgaa Silveroak<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;     Date: Sun, 01 May 2005 11:03:02 -0000<br/>\n&gt;     From: &quot;everquestdragon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:everquestdragon@...\">everquestdragon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: loading spell<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone know the code for the hot button to load your saved spells.
