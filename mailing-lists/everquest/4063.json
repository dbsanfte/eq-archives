I&#39;m not trying to diss techtv, I never even heard of it, <br/>\nand when I first read the &quot;call for help&quot; and EQ enthusiest (addict) <br/>\nit struck me as a sort of blow to the gut. Yes there are people who <br/>\ndo play EQ a lot for many different reasons, one in my case  is that <br/>\nI live in a really borring town and shops close at like 8pm on <br/>\nweekdays... even the mall... so other than EQ I&#39;d just be sitting <br/>\ndown watching TV... *sighs* I need to move to pheonix or back to <br/>\nhawaii... anyways just saying that I didn&#39;t know about techtv and I <br/>\napologize if I said anything harsh, I didn&#39;t know what the show was <br/>\nabout or the segment &quot;call for help&quot;. but also saying that people <br/>\nreading should not only know the facts, but also need to be told the <br/>\nfacts for not everyone around the world understands things, like me <br/>\nbeing from Hawaii I&#39;m sure most people don&#39;t know how to say or what <br/>\nwords mean like &quot;Ikaika&quot; or how to say kalanianiole... but yeah <br/>\nthat&#39;s what I think is that facts need to be known that is true, but <br/>\nalso need to be told to those who don&#39;t know for ignorance is not <br/>\nalways bliss...<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw for those on the Rathe. a few guilds are having a Kith raid this <br/>\nwed, not sure what time atm, but I will find out today and post it up <br/>\ntomarrow. so all you rogues out there who need the kith raid come <br/>\njoin us for some killing MWAHAHAHAHAHA. peace out all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaqard Tactiz 54 Dwarven Rake of the Rathe<br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s kill them all!!
