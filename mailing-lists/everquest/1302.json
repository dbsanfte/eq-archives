If I&#39;d pissed<br/>\nhim off he could&#39;ve easily disbanded me. I&#39;ve had people disband me from<br/>\ngroup bc they were pissed off that I couldn&#39;t heal them in time (like one<br/>\ntime in Crushbone when I kept getting hit by Legos-- the group leader didn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve me that I kept getting hit. She claimed that I wasn&#39;t even trying to<br/>\nheal her).<br/>\nAlthough onetime we had a group leader who was such a jerk that we all sent<br/>\ntells to each other and regrouped without him. We had to put him on ignore.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think what I would have done in that situation would be to loot instead<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; worrying about healing this jerk.  And when he asked for a heal, saying<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have to be quick about getting loot so : P.  What else would someone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>like<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that deserve?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lena<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yeah. Sometimes you group with the only people available though. Like in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Highpass if you need in a group you&#39;re stuck with the people camping the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; room you want to camp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had mostly good experiences with looting but there are a few people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who&#39;ve given me trouble. One thing that pissed me off-- I was group<br/>\n </span></blockquote>leader<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; and had alpha loot established. My computer crashed. When i logged back<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; there was a new group leader. Despite the fact that I had been at the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>spawn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; point first and had established the group, he felt that bc he had<br/>\n </span></blockquote>reinvited<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; people that he was now in charge. He said it was FFA -- ninja loot.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When I asked them to allow me to loot just once corpse he told me I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>could if<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I was fast enough. Often while I was busy healing him he&#39;d go loot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something. When it was clear he didn&#39;t appreciate my help, I left.
