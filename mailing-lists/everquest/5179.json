First off, even at level 55+ dervishes will be much lower<br/>\n&gt; in level but can still hurt you plenty.  The hit hard, and can<br/>\n&gt; quikcly gang up if there is more than one in the area.  The second<br/>\n&gt; danger is the giants that roam.  While these guys are easily<br/>\n&gt; quelmed, they also hit hard and can gang up.  If you are fighting<br/>\n&gt; one of these and a dervish or two join in... well you better be a<br/>\n&gt; tank with massive HP, be a necro with a pet, or have an extra pair<br/>\n&gt; of shoes in the bank because you are going to be on a CR soon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup. and going LD in the middle of EW while fighting snow cougars and<br/>\ngetting dervish adds REALLY bites.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, EW has one additional danger that many people do not think<br/>\n&gt; about.  If you are fighting near the Kael ramp you don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; linger.  Hanging around the Kael ramp too long spawns the Death<br/>\n&gt; Squad and these things will tear through anything that is not on<br/>\n&gt; their faction.  Just a heads up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup. Hence the reason why I think people should hunt near IC bridge and well<br/>\naways from Kael. :-)<br/>\nAlthough the DeathSquad was fun to outrun while autofollowing in a group.<br/>\nlol.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
