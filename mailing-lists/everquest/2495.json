He said that he had the very same problem, and that if you complain long enough and loud enough they will give you ALL of the service you are paying for.  If i had this problem i wouldnt rest until they either gave me a full line / bandwidth or reduced my line rental accordingly.  If youre paying the usual line rental charges, Sue, then dont be a fool - get onto them and say the word Solicitor as often and as loud as you can.  Bottom line - you are being scammed!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 15 March 2002 11:28<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: MORE then one account?? please explain<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYup. I have a special wire just for modems. Brand new. Was connecting at 24k<br/>\nbefore. Now max is 26k.<br/>\nIt&#39;s because I&#39;m being a slick. Basically the phone company was lazy and<br/>\nrather than giving me a full phone line, they set up a slick where they<br/>\nspliced up existing lines and spread them out among houses in my area. So we<br/>\nonly get partial lines and low bandwidth. I talked to my ISP and they first<br/>\nsuggested I was behind a slick. When a repairman for my phone company came<br/>\nout he confirmed that we&#39;re behind a slick. Said that the bandwidth was<br/>\nwithin &quot;acceptible&quot; limits. When I asked the phone company about being taken<br/>\nout from behind the slick they didn&#39;t know what one was. After I explained<br/>\nthey denied that I was behind one. I told them that I had been informed by<br/>\nsomeone who worked on the phone lines that I was and that he even told me<br/>\nthe location of the slick. So I have 10 miles of spliced lines. Hell, when<br/>\nthey worked on my neighbors lines they turned off my caller ID, call<br/>\nwaiting, and disabled my main phone line for 3 days. Well, the line wasn&#39;t<br/>\nworking for 3 days. it kept saying it was busy bc they mixed it up with my<br/>\nneighbors. the call waiting and caller ID still aren&#39;t working. I&#39;m trying<br/>\nto find some type of solution to get decent lines. But I can&#39;t even get TV<br/>\nout where I live-- or get my road paved. so I&#39;m probably out of luck.<br/>\nSorry for the rant.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you tried replacing your modem wire? The one that plugs into the wall?<br/>\nThey can go bad, and it&#39;s a cheap fix that can help sometimes on a &quot;noisy&quot;<br/>\nline, if nothing else is really noisy (like the phone).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Su<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Friday, March 15, 2002 3:28 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: MORE then one account?? please explain<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; there are hints about the bandwidth EQ needs on the official EQ site,<br/>\n  &gt; but it is somewhat hard to find ... it is sort of information for ISPs<br/>\n  &gt; so they know how much traffic within an hour or so can occur playing<br/>\n  &gt; this game.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, when I was connecting around 40k we could have 3 people on at the<br/>\nsame<br/>\n  time and not have lag too badly.<br/>\n  but our phone lines here just suck so bad.
