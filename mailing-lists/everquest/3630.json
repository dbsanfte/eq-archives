That time I was following a Necro, lvl 30. <br/>\nWatched his kills. Much faster than mine. Curious as to whether this <br/>\nis normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps my technique is flakey. I ensnare, ensnarring root, dot, dot, <br/>\nand med. Have to often refresh the root at least once. Then refresh <br/>\none dot. Dead brute. Not too fast, but affective. This is on dark <br/>\nblue brutes with me at lvl 33.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it goes well I come out down only one bubble of mana. Usually at <br/>\nleast half. Only twice did I get low, and then I just burned the rest <br/>\non nukes to finish the kill. Didn&#39;t want to waste mana on roots that <br/>\nweren&#39;t holding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am working as a pure caster now, and this is my highest level <br/>\ncharacter. I am unfamiliar with hybrids, but watching a lower level <br/>\nnecro outpace my kills made me wonder if I could not do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
