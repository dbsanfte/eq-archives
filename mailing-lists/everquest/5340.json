He uses a 2 handed sword so I can&#39;t carry anything in my<br/>\nhands.  I have the worn newbie candle in my pack for light.  I bought a<br/>\nlantern but it did nothing in my pack.  I was looking in the bazaar and saw<br/>\nlightstones, mechanical light emitters and various creature eyes.  Are any<br/>\nof these a better light then my candle and can they be used from my pack?<br/>\nWhen I look at the items it makes no mention of range or brightness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIksar monk 12<br/>\nWood Elf Ranger 12<br/>\nHuman Paladin 6<br/>\n&quot;just trying all the options to see what I like.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
