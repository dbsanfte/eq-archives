Most of this info can be found on web,<br/>\nthey just lump it one place.<br/>\n<br/>\nItem locations and quests can be found at www.everquest.allakhazam.com<br/>\n<br/>\nTrade skill info is all at www.eqtraders.com<br/>\n<br/>\nMaps can be found at www.eqatlas.com<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Kazaa Lite (not plain Kazaa, it will jack up your PC) I found a ton of<br/>\nEQ cheat, hack plat-making, etc guides.  I downloaded some and if they don&#39;t<br/>\ninvolve anything illegal I would be willing to post them to the files<br/>\nsection of the group for those that don&#39;t want to mess with file-sharing<br/>\nprograms.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor $5 less then the guide you can buy 10,000 plat if that is what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe careful with power-leveling.  It is a great way to make a high-leveled<br/>\ncharacter that is pretty useless.  In some games it works great since the<br/>\nonly way to increase skills is to gain a level.  When people come to EQ they<br/>\ndo it and end with with a level 30 char with no skills.  You get 5 points<br/>\nfor leveling, I normally get 100 - 150 skill points while gaining my level.<br/>\nHow are you going to make up for all those lost points?  You do boring stuff<br/>\nover and over and over, that&#39;s how.  When I get to level 30 I won&#39;t need to<br/>\nspend hours working my safe fall, bind wounds, or dodge, I use them all the<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also concerned about the PDFs.  How often are they updated?  I have<br/>\nseveral of the published EQ guides I have gotten from book store discount<br/>\nracks and much of the stuff in them is flat out wrong.  The game is always<br/>\nchanging and the websites change with it, my books do not.  Do these guides<br/>\nget updated with every patch?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
