My mom&#39;s computer doesn&#39;t seem to do it. She has a<br/>\npentium while I have an athlon.  It is extremely annoying. and I get high<br/>\npitched whines. I know it&#39;s not the sound card bc my mom has the same sound<br/>\ncard. I&#39;m wondering if it somehow has something to do with the processor? I<br/>\ndunno. It&#39;s weird and annoying.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone else have problems with &quot;choppy&quot; sound in game? I am<br/>\n&gt; currently running a 1.2 gHz Gateway Athlon system with 512 MB of PC-<br/>\n&gt; 133 SDRAM, nVidia GeForce 2 Ultra with 64 MB, and a Sound Blaster<br/>\n&gt; Live! X-Gamer 5.1 sound card. Operating System is Windows XP Home<br/>\n&gt; Edition. Connection is via aDSL. I have downloaded and installed all<br/>\n&gt; the latest drivers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My sound, particularly the music, &quot;stutters&quot; and repeats in the game<br/>\n&gt; to the point it is almost unbearably annoying and I have to turn the<br/>\n&gt; speakers off or way down. It does not appear to affect the video<br/>\n&gt; and/or gameplay, but I should think my system is more than adequate<br/>\n&gt; to play the game with sound turned on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do have the Luclin expansion, and I have turned on a FEW of the<br/>\n&gt; new skins, but only those of the races and genders of my own<br/>\n&gt; characters: Wood Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, and Human (necessary to<br/>\n&gt; display Erudite). I also have horses and elementals turned on, but<br/>\n&gt; that is all. Social animations, mip mapping, texture mapping, and<br/>\n&gt; texture compression are off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have tried turning the sound acceleration down in Control Panel,<br/>\n&gt; but that appears to have no effect on the choppiness of the sound. I<br/>\n&gt; also turned sound realism up and turned off reverb by using /reverb<br/>\n&gt; in the chat box, at one person&#39;s suggestion. Does anyone have any<br/>\n&gt; ideas/tips/solutions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Froondor Oakenbark, 41 Wood Elf Druid male<br/>\n&gt; Froontor Whipslash, 29 Barbarian Warrior male(retired)<br/>\n&gt; Froondar Oakenbark, 27 Wood Elf Warrior male<br/>\n&gt; Texxas Rannger, 21 Wood Elf Ranger male<br/>\n&gt; Froonvah, 12 Vah Shir Beastlord male<br/>\n&gt; Froondoc, 11 Dwarf Cleric male<br/>\n&gt; Squiddles, 9 Vah Shir Shaman female<br/>\n&gt; Froonlea, 4 Erudite Wizard female<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All on Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
