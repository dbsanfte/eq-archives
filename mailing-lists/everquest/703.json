This is not my intent. With that having been said, <br/>\nonward I must rant.<br/>\n<br/>\n/rant on<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my belief that EQ could be so much more than it is. I find myself with <br/>\nmany ideas that could be used to help strengthen EQ, and Verant chooses to <br/>\nignore those suggestions even though they&#39;re easily implementable. I don&#39;t <br/>\nclaim to have all the answers, nor do I claim that by implementing my <br/>\nsuggestions that EQ will be totally fixed. But when will Verant take note <br/>\nand start listening to their customers? For the most part, they&#39;d rather <br/>\nignore us than listen. I find this highly disturbing. Is it be just one <br/>\nplayers problem/suggestion, if we&#39;re all complaining about it, or suggesting <br/>\nit? (It being whatever problem/issue/idea is at hand) And why can&#39;t they <br/>\ngive good customer support? Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve had some very good <br/>\nsupport from GM&#39;s and Guides, but unfortunately, I&#39;ve had way more bad <br/>\nencounters than good ones. Overall, it&#39;s leaving me rather unsatisfied for <br/>\nmy $10 a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, instead using their resources on fixing problems, Verant would <br/>\nrather rave on and on about a player run economy that&#39;s practically non <br/>\nexistent. They point to the trade skills and say &quot;There&#39;s your answer!&quot; <br/>\nTruthfully, what real use are the trade skills? For that matter, how come <br/>\nthe trade skills don&#39;t make much sense? One point in case - mechanical <br/>\nlockpicks - rat ears are part of the recipe. Does that make sense? Not <br/>\nreally. Can I live with it? Yes. But when something as simple as the recipe <br/>\nfor the Telescoping fishing pole can&#39;t be figured out because of the &quot;lack <br/>\nof sense&quot; with the trade skill, wouldn&#39;t it signal to someone that maybe, <br/>\njust maybe, something is wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nA very good example of this is tinkering. Being part of the Tinkerer&#39;s <br/>\nmailing list, I know firsthand how many people were involved with <br/>\nresearching the recipe, as well as how much PP went into it&#39;s discovery. I <br/>\nknow for a fact that correct recipe has been used many times before, and it <br/>\nnever worked. Now all of a sudden it does? Seems a bit fishy to me. Now try <br/>\nand get a straight answer out of a GM or Guide about it. In fact, try to get <br/>\nANY straight answer out of a GM or Guide, or even get anything from them at <br/>\nall. They&#39;re usually too busy ignoring us to care.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, in spite of everything, I guess the single number one thing that <br/>\nirritates me most, is the fact that I realize that EQ could and should be so <br/>\nmuch more. And instead of taking EQ to where it should be, I have to sit on <br/>\nmy butt due to lack of technical programming expertise, and watch from the <br/>\nsidelines while Verant idly tweaks and nerfs everything to hell with &quot;band <br/>\naid patches&quot;, instead of just outright fixing it. That&#39;s why I&#39;m currently <br/>\nlooking for a new game, (excluding AC or UO) or for a programming group with <br/>\nthe ability to do something high calibre like EQ but better, and that also <br/>\nhas the smarts to avoid the same pitfalls.<br/>\n<br/>\n/rant off</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
