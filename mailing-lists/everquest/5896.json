I feel I am knowledgeable about many things in <br/>\nregards to each class, race, etc. Yet, there is the one question <br/>\nthat evades me.. For the &quot;Knight&quot; classes, (Shadowknights and <br/>\nPaladins), what is better..the traditional 1hs or the 2hs. I have <br/>\nseen people, including my friends who do 2hs, and some that do 1hs. <br/>\nWhat are the pros and cons of each...so I can decide which way to go <br/>\nwith my new pally...<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
