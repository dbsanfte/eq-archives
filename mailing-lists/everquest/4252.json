The EverQuest <br/>\nCompanion, rather than being a hint book, is about the history of the <br/>\ngame, the community around it, and the issues that have come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;ve created a Yahoo group called &quot;The EverQuest Companion&quot; (and <br/>\nyes, it took me this long to get around to advertising it...I was busy <br/>\nrushing through book chapters at the time), and, with things settling <br/>\ndown and another three chapters still to put into rough draft, I now <br/>\nhave time to actually send updates to it.  If anybody is interested in <br/>\nkeeping track of the book, or just talking about MMORPGs in general, <br/>\nplease, join!  Now that I have time to make it work, I&#39;m hoping it will <br/>\nbe a friendly place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe URL is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EQCompanion/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EQCompanion/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s hoping to see some people there...<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards to all,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Marks<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n&quot;The battle is terrible and now joined by all.<br/>\nCount Roland is no laggard;<br/>\nHe strikes with his spear, while the shaft still lasts.<br/>\nWith fifteen blows he has broken and destroyed it;<br/>\nHe draws forth Durendal, his fine, naked sword,<br/>\nAnd spurs on his horse to strike at Chernubles.&quot;<br/>\n\t\t- The Song of Roland, lines 1320-1325<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent: Demonsbane; Pocket Books<br/>\n\tThe Ranger Battle Sword; Last Legend<br/>\nForthcoming: Durendal, the sword of Roland; Last Legend, January/February 2003<br/>\n\tThe EverQuest Companion; Osborne McGraw-Hill, August 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.istar.ca/~delric/home.html\">http://home.istar.ca/~delric/home.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
