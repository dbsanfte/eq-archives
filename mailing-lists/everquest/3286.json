How do<br/>\nthese differ from Pets? Also when you die and have a &quot;familiar&quot; do you<br/>\nhave to reconjure them up like you do a pet or do they come back when<br/>\nyou do? And finally who all can have a &quot;familiar&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
