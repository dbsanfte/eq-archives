The majority of viruses <br/>\nout there expliot the OS, NOT the mail program. They use Outlook <br/>\nsimply because it is one of the more widely used programs. The virus <br/>\nwill still work under most conditions. The only exceptions to these <br/>\nare like linux, BeOS and other non-microsoft operating systems. Think <br/>\nabout it, if were to write a virus that is to infiltrate and do as <br/>\nmuch damage as it could and your target(s) primarily use one type of <br/>\nOS then you will taylor it to that OS in hopes that it gets there. My <br/>\nwife switched to Eudora and was acting all smug thinking she was <br/>\nimmune to viruses and then she got nailed by one. I was quietly <br/>\ngiggling my butt off at her, she was ranting and raving and carrying <br/>\non how she shouldn&#39;t be getting any viruses. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes down to it there is no better protection than a virus <br/>\ndetection program! There are several programs out there and some that <br/>\nare free. I suggest to purchase one, you get better support and <br/>\nbetter DAT file updates. You can also go to my website and run a free <br/>\nonline virus check at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kosingigglephits.com\">http://www.kosingigglephits.com</a> It&#39;s located on <br/>\nthe left hand side of the screen.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
