The only experience I ever had like<br/>\nthat was the result of inhailing the vapors of a certain herb. My<br/>\nbrain reset every thirty seconds for about two hours. Like lag in the<br/>\ngame, it was something one could work around. Unlike in the game, I<br/>\nfound it rather pleasant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an amnesiac during a surgery. That is not the same thing. I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t remember much at all. Nothing of the surgery itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it suck if people driving old cars suffered from lag? New<br/>\ncars would flash by in lurching images as we who had old cars would<br/>\ntry to figure out where the danger might be. The road would be like<br/>\nPOP with an old machine. Almost impossible to navigate.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
