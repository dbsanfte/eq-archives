There are two mobs there that drop the<br/>\n&gt; items needed for smithing.  The owlbears and sonic wolves drop different<br/>\n&gt; substances that are used together with metal rings to make humming<br/>\n&gt; orbs...these triv around 180 making it easy to get smithing up for just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cost of making the rings...no water needed.  The only problem is these<br/>\n&gt; substances drop the most often when the mobs control the islands in the<br/>\n&gt; south of the Hollowshade zone.  That being the case most people trigger<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; war to get the owlbears or sonic wolves to overrun the grimling there and<br/>\n&gt; make the islands their home.  once you reach 180 or so in smithing you can<br/>\n&gt; start making Shadowscream armor.  Forgot what piece it was, but one part<br/>\n&gt; trivs at 208, another around 225, and the boots triv at 250+.
