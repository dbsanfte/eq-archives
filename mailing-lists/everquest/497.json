If it <br/>\nwere Me I&#39;d do a barbarian.  While all races have advantages and <br/>\ndisadvantages, it is very important to know that Trolls and Ogres have a very <br/>\nhard time getting into cities and crossing zones with guards from good races. <br/>\n While I have played both an Erudite Wizard and a Barbarian Warrior - the <br/>\nrace/class combo I like the most is the Barbarian Shaman.  Shaman&#39;s are great <br/>\nbecause:<br/>\n<br/>\nThey got the single best spell in the game in my opinion which is Spirit of <br/>\nWolf (SOW)<br/>\ncan summon food and water<br/>\ncan bind and gate<br/>\ngreat buff spells<br/>\ndecent melee fighters for having pretty good damage spells<br/>\nGreat healing spells<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro<br/>\n15th lvl Erudite Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
