They hang around begging, saying<br>please, and so on and so forth. One \n  guy told me today,<br>&quot;Damn druids ruin the game.&quot; Lovely.<br><br>So my poll \n  today is to collect people&#39;s favorite ways<br>of denying requests when they \n  don&#39;t want to/don&#39;t have<br>the time/are in a group/don&#39;t feel like complying. \n  If<br>anyone has an amusing, polite, or snotty reply to<br>share with me I&#39;d \n  love to hear it - I&#39;m going to set<br>my favorites up as hotkeys, so please \n  don&#39;t share it<br>unless you don&#39;t mind me copying it :)<br><br>Many thanks in \n  advance for everyone&#39;s assistance,<br>Nymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br>Lvl 47 Wood Elf \n  Druid<br>Cazic-Thule Server <br><br><br>=====<br>Nymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br>Wood Elf \n  Druid, Cazic-Thule \n  Server<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do You \n  Yahoo!?<br>Yahoo!
