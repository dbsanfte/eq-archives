The only<br/>\n&gt; known use I have seen is for the 100% weight reduction bags. I only<br/>\n&gt; have two so far. Need three to make my first attempt at the<br/>\n&gt; combination. That is just the beginning for making the bags.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I got tired of camping Brutes in Warsliks Woods, so finally made<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; journey to Velious. I took the boat, just to have done it once.<br/>\n&gt; Found<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my way to Eastern Wastes. Started foraging the tufts of dire wolf<br/>\n&gt; fur<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I need for advancing my tailoring.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have not been fortunate in hunting. Level 34 puts me low on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; food chain in EW. I have tried my standard hunting routine from<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; foot of the bridge, but have been beaten back to the zone<br/>\n&gt; repeatedly.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This last time, I crossed the zone to get away from a mob, and was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instantly killed by some kind of tracking wolf pack. They took me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down twice more in the next fifteen minutes. Found someone else<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; contending with them when I resurrected. He being a higher level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; offered to train them away, and did so. I got my corpse and got my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff back, but am now a high 33 again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I may have to rethink my Velious career. Solo at 34 in EW seems a<br/>\n&gt; bit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tough, even if I need the tufts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are the direwolf tufts only for hafling tailoring?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I keep seeing them dropped on the ground near the bank. If they can<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; foraged I think you can forage them in GD and Thurgadin. GD seems<br/>\n&gt; to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; less mobs. There are some spots that are safer to hunt. There&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; spot where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you can just get the wolves and if you get into trouble you can run<br/>\n&gt; to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; coldain wolves and guards for help.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
