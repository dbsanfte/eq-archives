Really appreciate it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I already have the VM set to max - no problem with all of the<br/>\n&gt; available disk space.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems most of you are pointing to the Video controller as the<br/>\n&gt; likely solution. Could well be - the existing one is only 16MB. But<br/>\n&gt; why would a slow video cause such a hit on the hard disk, which seems<br/>\n&gt; to be viusally where the bottleneck is - i.e. on zoning, the hard<br/>\n&gt; disk is very active until it zones are goes back to the server<br/>\n&gt; screen. The hard disk is performing extremely well and is very fast,<br/>\n&gt; so that is not the problemin itself - could the slwo graphics card<br/>\n&gt; cause EQ to go to the hard disk more to compensate?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am not sure I could go to a 128MB graphics card - would 64Mb do?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks once again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Fire on High&quot; &lt;scendera@o...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yep...it does make a big difference.The VM tweak is just a<br/>\n&gt; little &quot;freebie&quot; for overall performance, not just EQ. 11 day uptimes<br/>\n&gt; on my WinME-based EQ box... yup, consider me convinced, fully and<br/>\n&gt; truly. Likewise the amount of sheer ABUSE my LAN server gets, and the<br/>\n&gt; stability and speed difference once the VM was fixed to reflect<br/>\n&gt; changes in real ram.Overall, spending $50 for a Geforce 2 will be an<br/>\n&gt; investment you&#39;re likely to be pleased with. Also, if your power<br/>\n&gt; supply is wimpy, consider invest in a bigger one...300 watts should<br/>\n&gt; be plenty for a Geforce 2 and sufficient cooling for everything, but<br/>\n&gt; 250 will do the trick with less breathing room...any less, upgrade.<br/>\n&gt;  4/9/03<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
