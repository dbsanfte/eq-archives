Need the hides for my tailoring. <br/>\nHalfling tailor, Vale Armor. The exp is not great, but since I need <br/>\nthe hides anyway, it is working well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is unfortunate that the Halfling cultural armor does not offer <br/>\nthat much in stats. I have replaced all of my armor which has not <br/>\nbeen superior to the Vale armor, except next trip to Rivervale I need <br/>\nto make leggings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may try to sell some pieces in the Bazzaar, but don&#39;t think the <br/>\nmarket is very good for that. Probably will make a few pieces to give <br/>\nto young Halfling druids, then find my way to Velious to begin <br/>\naquiring pieces of fur for the Underhill bags.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there will be a market for those.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nHalfling Druid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
