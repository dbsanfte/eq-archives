In<br/>\ncase you are not familiar with them, these are not the ones you buy at Radio<br/>\nShack. They are specifically designed for racing and my radio alone cost<br/>\nmore then the most expensive car at Radio Shack.  If you are familiar, I run<br/>\nin the Stock Truck class with an Associated T3.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bodies of the vehicles are made of clear Lexan and are painted on the<br/>\ninside to keep the paint from coming off during collisions. There is a glue<br/>\navailable that will let you glue pictures from magazines to the inside of<br/>\nyour vehicle before you paint it. The paper you use in your printer is to<br/>\nthick and tends to peel off, it needs to be the thinner paper used in<br/>\nmagazines.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to make an EQ body for the on-road car I will be getting soon.<br/>\nImagine if Sony sponsored a NASCAR car for EverQuest.  If anybody has any<br/>\ncomputer or video game magazines with EQ related ads or other color pictures<br/>\nI would very much like to get some. They can be for EQ, EQII, EQ Adventures,<br/>\nChampions of Norrath or any of the EQ games. I will cut out the pics I need<br/>\nso most anything has potential. I will take pages ripped out or entire<br/>\nmagazines. I will pay shipping and reimburse for the magazine. They will<br/>\nneed to be kept FLAT, if they have creases they will not be any good for my<br/>\npurposes. I am located in the US if that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the maps that came with EQ Evolution and may use some of them. The<br/>\nmanual is B&W so not much use.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I get enough pictures to do up the body I will gladly post pics of it<br/>\nwhen done.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I brake for loot!&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
