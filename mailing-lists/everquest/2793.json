Got it installed and went for a test \n  drive.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; One area that is a big problem is \n  Rivervale. With the last <br>expansion <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rivervale became \n  so laggy that I avoided going home when I could. <br>Now <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  I get a few hiccups when I enter the zone, then it settles down <br>to a \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; playable level. A hitch now and then, but nothing like \n  before the <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; upgrade.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked \n  out a few cities, some zones in between. Made technical <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  adjustments. On the whole quite pleased.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; One \n  thing I noticed was a bit of lag in laggy zones (Luclin was \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; almost unplayable until now)until I had been there a bit. \n  When I <br>went <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Bazaar I just did a slow 360 and \n  the lag went away. Figure <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; enough of the zone loaded into \n  active memory to carry the play <br>from <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; then on. Perhaps \n  someone could explain what was actuall happening <br>to <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  the system when I do this. Anyway, I do a scan of my environment <br>when \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I zone and things are pretty smooth.<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my last upgrade to my present system. Have to \n  replace my <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; tower next, and hope to hold out a while. How \n  much can I spend <br>every <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; year on these things? The \n  family expects me to feed them, and I <br>hate <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to \n  dissppoint them too often on that account just to play my game.<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if DSL comes down a bit in price, I may try that. \n  Could that <br>be <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; the key to absolute \n  smooth-as-butter-on-a-bald-monkey performance <br>on <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; my \n  aging machine? (The thing is just a bit over a year old. How <br>fast \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; they grow old.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barto \n  Proudfoot<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo!
