However, when I tried to turn in the items for <br/>\nmy Broom of Trillion, Vira told me that Solusek Ro did not accept half <br/>\nmeasures, kept my items, and did not give me the focus item.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe evidently felt that I had somehow failed to properly fulfill the quest, <br/>\nyet I am certain I gave her all the correct items. When offering her an item, <br/>\nthe 4-slot trade-box opens with that item in the first slot. Does it matter <br/>\nwhat order the items are placed in the slots? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I wonder about is that after I turned in my items and received  <br/>\nthe stein, I talked to her about all of the other focus quests. I do not <br/>\nremember what order we discussed them, but could she only be remembering the <br/>\nlast one we discussed and it was not for the broom?<br/>\n<br/>\nCanostrol<br/>\n32 Gnome Mage<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
