I had need of a cpouple of coffins this past<br/>\nweekend when a friend of mine who is lvl 11 somehow managed to fall to the<br/>\n3rd level in Befallen and he didnt know how to get to his corpse.  I wound<br/>\nup having to call on a necro in the guild to use the Summon Corpse spell she<br/>\nhad since I didnt know where to get the coffins.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW what is the name of the coffins I need for the lesser summon corpse<br/>\nspell that we SK have?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for PoM I&#39;ve yet to go  on any raid to any of the planes.  There wsa one<br/>\nperson on the Saryn server that was having open PLanes raids but from what I<br/>\nunderstand she quit having them when she finlly got a guild to back her up<br/>\non a regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks<br/>\n<br/>\nCynfyn MacCulloch 49 DESK<br/>\nHalyburton Bearhugger 22BarbShm<br/>\nSaltaque 12 HIEEnch<br/>\nQapmoc 11 HalfElfRngr<br/>\nOroblram 9HumanWar<br/>\nDefender of the Faith<br/>\nSaryn server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Nygaard, Jeff&quot; &lt;jeff.nygaard@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The easiest place to buy coffins is on the moon, in the bazaar zone. The<br/>\n&gt; first merchant next to the bank sells them. He sells both kinds, stackable<br/>\n&gt; and non-stackable coffins. I just had to buy a couple yesterday :-( Some<br/>\n&gt; guild members do not listen about pushing mobs through the wall, I was<br/>\n&gt; tanking a flurry drake in NToV and it got pushed through the wall and it<br/>\n&gt; summon myself and 2 others. Since I was bound in bazaar and the corpse&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; were now almost to the Plane of Mischief zone, they had to be summoned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, has anyone else been to the PoM zone before? Some card drops are<br/>\n&gt; dropped at a ridiculous rate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.371 / Virus Database: 206 - Release Date: 6/13/02 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
