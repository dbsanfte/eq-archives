In regards<br/>\nto the PoP and LoY Expansions - each of these expansions have some of the<br/>\nbest utilities in all of Everquest. I couldn&#39;t live without these utilities<br/>\never again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PoP has teleporting stones throughout all the lands. There is no real<br/>\nneed to wait on ports or even pay for a port unless these is no Plane of<br/>\nKnowledge Stone anywhere around, 1 or 2 zones away. Levels 1 through 65 can<br/>\nuse the stones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe LoY expansion released on screen maps. You can zoom in and out. You can<br/>\nlook at all of Felwithe or just the platform and hut you are standing on.<br/>\nAll my maps have the name of the class GM listed where he is located. Really<br/>\nno reason to get lost anymore. I would say 90% of the zones have maps. Maps<br/>\nhave succor locations. You can modify each zone map to mark key locations<br/>\nand spawn points.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how long ago you played, but travel has been one of the very<br/>\nlow points for me. I can remember waiting on the boat in Butcher Block many<br/>\ntimes, thinking there has to be a better way - this is not fun. Well travel<br/>\nis longer a task that takes you forever. These 2 key EQ tools were well<br/>\nworth the cash in and of itself in my onion. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \tinflamatory890 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjjdaniel@...\">jjjdaniel@...</a>] <br/>\nSent:\tSunday, June 01, 2003 6:30 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[EverQuest] WinXP and Sound Blaster (live) music (midi)<br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I hope this group is for the PC version of Everquest. I quit <br/>\nabout a year and a half ago when I upgraded to Windows XP. I have a <br/>\nSound Blaster Live (value) card. I had the Shadows of Luclin <br/>\nexpansion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sound effects and ambient sounds were good, but the music was <br/>\nhorribly distorted. I did the usual card driver updates with XP and <br/>\nposted to the Vault and other fan sites. Others with XP and this <br/>\nsound card had the same problem. EQ support emailed me back a <br/>\nresponse that they were aware and were working on the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I consider coming back, I was wondering if anyone had similar <br/>\nproblems and were they solved with the current, new expansion I <br/>\nbelieve is called &quot;Planes of Power&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d hate to invest in the expansion to discover I still can&#39;t have <br/>\nthe music specific to areas within the zones. Any feedback would be <br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
