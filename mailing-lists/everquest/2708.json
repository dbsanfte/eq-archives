Now, having reached level 30, all of the gnolls are<br/>\nnow nearing the point where hunting them isn&#39;t beneficial. Could someone<br/>\nsuggest a similar zone/area with good experience and average to good loot<br/>\nwhere I could hunt fairly safely, either in a group or solo?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, Could someone suggest an item for my arm, back, of legs that gives a<br/>\ndecent (around +3) Wisdom modifer that I could try to track down for myself<br/>\neither through a quest or through hunting loot?<br/>\n<br/>\nDamasciss<br/>\n30 Druid<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
