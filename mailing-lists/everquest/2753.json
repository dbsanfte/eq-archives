In the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; past you maxed your Wis at 200 then got mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boosting items. Now I think it maxes at 250.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Close. The WIS maximum has always been 255, but before<br/>\n&gt; Luclin WIS above 200 only gave one point of mana per<br/>\n&gt; point of WIS. They loosened the soft cap around the<br/>\n&gt; release of Luclin, so now each point of WIS above 200<br/>\n&gt; gives around 5-6 mana. In my experience (44 Druid is<br/>\n&gt; my main) the best bet is to get WIS up to the 200 cap<br/>\n&gt; then start shopping for resist and mana items. There&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; quite a few very inexpensive items with major WIS<br/>\n&gt; boosts available.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To the other guy, at 33 you&#39;re high enough to be<br/>\n&gt; leveling in Velious, i&#39;d recommend heading over there<br/>\n&gt; ASAP. I started by root and rotting Snow Cougars in<br/>\n&gt; Iceclad til 34, then quad kiting them til 38. (I<br/>\n&gt; believe it was 38 that they started conning light<br/>\n&gt; blue, might have been 37) From there you can do<br/>\n&gt; Drakkel Dire Wolves in GD for faction or quad Ulthorks<br/>\n&gt; in EW for amazing loot and good xp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The side perk of hunting in Velious is that&#39;s where<br/>\n&gt; the higher levels tend to congregate these days. Drop<br/>\n&gt; your bind at the bank in Thurg and keep an eye out for<br/>\n&gt; those 100pp port requests. *grin*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Only a few days left to file! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://taxes.yahoo.ca\">http://taxes.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
