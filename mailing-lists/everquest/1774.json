At<br/>\nleast you&#39;ll have some weaponry to defend yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if you died at Orc hill or somewhere like that try to group and see if<br/>\nthey would cover you until you can get all your stuff back.<br/>\n<br/>\n*******************************************************<br/>\nSteven R.
