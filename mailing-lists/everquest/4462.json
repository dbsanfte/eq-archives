Su, I&#39;m sorry for everything, none of<br/>\n&gt; this goes to you, I <br/>\n&gt; know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you tired, but there are just too many morons to<br/>\n&gt; filter out of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; group. To the rest of you, you will never get<br/>\n&gt; anywhere in life <br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the attitudes you have. Only in a fantasy game<br/>\n&gt; like EverQuest will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you ever be something. But at some point you<br/>\n&gt; need to grow up and <br/>\n&gt; face<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reality, and it&#39;s not going to be fun or easy<br/>\n&gt; when you do. Do not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bother replying to this post. Leave your fights<br/>\n&gt; and comments out <br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Su&#39;s group and for once in your life respect her<br/>\n&gt; wishes and be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CONSIDERATE. If you forgot what that word means,<br/>\n&gt; get a <br/>\n&gt; dictionary.
