My<br/>\nmother even plays.<br/>\nSo to the first part of the question, yes, girls do play EQ. I saw some<br/>\npictures on the tribunal boards of some of the girls who play EQ so there<br/>\nare some cute ones. Assuming those are actually their real photos.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
