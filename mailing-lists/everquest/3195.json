I will be needing Brute hides, and so was<br/>\n&gt; ready to go and hunt <br/>\n&gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never<br/>\n&gt; met the boat. I <br/>\n&gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and<br/>\n&gt; they went out to <br/>\n&gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the boat<br/>\n&gt; left. The <br/>\n&gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick off<br/>\n&gt; gnolls, and <br/>\n&gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool<br/>\n&gt; box full of them. <br/>\n&gt; have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there<br/>\n&gt; until I get the <br/>\n&gt; rest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls,<br/>\n&gt; which I have <br/>\n&gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I<br/>\n&gt; want to do it the <br/>\n&gt; old-fashioned way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
