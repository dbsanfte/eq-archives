I was just<br/>\nmoaning that my 61 char is in the same exact boat but<br/>\nSony doesn&#39;t think my class is &quot;brutally broken&quot;. <br/>\nHeh.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you should go to sol b.  Do the zone area<br/>\n(30-34), then pool groups (35-40), then royal groups<br/>\n(40-45), then bats (45-52), then bats &#39;n bugs (52-56),<br/>\nthen ldc (57-61).  That&#39;ll get you to 61.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my monk I solo&#39;d there the whole way along that<br/>\npath.  As a rogue you&#39;d probably rather partner with<br/>\nsomeone who can taunt, but you&#39;d also have light blue<br/>\nexp opportunity the whole time.  If I could avoid PoP<br/>\nand go back to sol b for 61 - 65 I&#39;d do it in a flash<br/>\n(I loved that place).  Giants are too hard to solo for<br/>\na 61 monk, and ldc gave very slight light blue exp you<br/>\ncan&#39;t advance on... so no choices for me now but PoP,<br/>\nand I dislike PoP (can&#39;t solo there, nobody wants<br/>\nmonks).<br/>\n<br/>\nQuwi Changkane, Grandmaster Fenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Perhaps you people can help me.  This is something<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve pondered for awhile.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My rogue is level 32.  I play him infrequently.  At<br/>\n&gt; level 30 rogues get all the skills they are going to<br/>\n&gt; get.  Rogues are non-casters so they don&#39;t have new<br/>\n&gt; spells to look forward to.  The only things rogues<br/>\n&gt; have to look forward to are their disciplines at<br/>\n&gt; level 50.  So how does one get from level 30 to<br/>\n&gt; level 50 in the shortest amount of time possible? <br/>\n&gt; Whenever I play, it seems like I always have a hard<br/>\n&gt; time finding a group.  I&#39;m looking in places like<br/>\n&gt; Frontier Mountains, The Overthere, and Dawnshroud<br/>\n&gt; Peaks.  I&#39;m not high enough level that I can easily<br/>\n&gt; solo any mobs in either of those zones. But nobody<br/>\n&gt; seems to want to group.  So are there any zones<br/>\n&gt; where I can get quick xp by soloing?  Or are there<br/>\n&gt; other zones I could try for groups?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hate for my rogue to fall by the way side because<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s become a bore to play.  So any suggestions you<br/>\n&gt; have for playing rogue characters to help me out<br/>\n&gt; would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric Rennison<br/>\n&gt; 32 Half Elf Rogue<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
