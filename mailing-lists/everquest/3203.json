I<br>&gt; &gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, \n  and<br>&gt; &gt; they went out to<br>&gt; &gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the \n  boat, then the boat<br>&gt; &gt; left. The<br>&gt; &gt; shuttles just went \n  back to BB.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK \n  to pick off<br>&gt; &gt; gnolls, and<br>&gt; &gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I \n  almost have my bank tool<br>&gt; &gt; box full of them.<br>&gt; &gt; have \n  about eight to go. So, decided to stay there<br>&gt; &gt; until I get \n  the<br>&gt; &gt; rest.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Plus I have been getting fs \n  weapons from the gnolls,<br>&gt; &gt; which I have<br>&gt; &gt; tried to make \n  into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Hope they get \n  the boat fixed.
