Not<br/>\n&gt; as stable as 2000 and not compatible with alot of software.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve not had any problems with compatible softwares. Compatible mode has<br/>\n&gt; solved those problems that i used to have.

It is a real biyatch sometimes.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Wrong, use your admin account to install softwares. It&#39;s much better<br/>\n&gt; security to have a regular user account wich you use on regular basis and<br/>\n&gt; use the admin account when you are installing new softwares. That way it<br/>\n&gt; will be alot harder for you to fark up your system.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not wrong, I was logged in with admin account and it would not let me<br/>\ninstall software. I am the only user of my computer. I even logged in as<br/>\nadmin and it said I did not have the authority to install software. I had to<br/>\ngo into regedit and modify Permissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;maybe that info would be at www.tweakui.com?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; No, it&#39;s a reg hack.
