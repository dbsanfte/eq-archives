I seldom resort to my 2 hander in any <br/>\nsituation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I understand dual wield you keep the slow, hard hitting weapon in <br/>\nthe off hand.  The primary hand gauges how often you swing and how <br/>\noften you get a dual or double attack.  So if you put the slower <br/>\nweapon in the primary all your strikes are slower.  It really doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter whether you&#39;re the main tank or the backup.  As soon as you <br/>\ncast snare you&#39;re going to get whacked!  So blaze away.  And aggro <br/>\nmanagement is only a minor issue for you, even now.  You do need to <br/>\nlearn it, eventually, but it will come to you!<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n35th (Woohoo!)
