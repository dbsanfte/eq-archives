It was<br/>\n&gt;     not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     No problem. All of us were newbies once.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal<br/>\n&gt; or Loot my corpse? The book<br/>\n&gt;     says no but I beg to differ.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;Is it possible that I had two corpses out<br/>\n&gt; there? Meaning, When I went back<br/>\n&gt;     with a dead body I died again?  &gt;Which meant I<br/>\n&gt; found the wrong corpse?<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     You must have found the second corpse. It can be<br/>\n&gt; tough sometimes getting the<br/>\n&gt;     right corpse if you die more than once. And<br/>\n&gt; sometimes if you don&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt;     items other than foraged food, you lose the<br/>\n&gt; foraged stuff anyways and just<br/>\n&gt;     get back the food you started with. Up to level<br/>\n&gt; 5 I think you get your<br/>\n&gt;     food/drink and tome of discord back. I think<br/>\n&gt; your starting weapon too.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do<br/>\n&gt; now? seeing as I have no food,<br/>\n&gt;     no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I &gt;beg or do I start<br/>\n&gt; another char?<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;This game is totally fun but with the fact of<br/>\n&gt; trying to learn which way to<br/>\n&gt;     go all the time and dying, it is starting &gt;to<br/>\n&gt; get to me,<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned<br/>\n&gt; to this board since the Chat<br/>\n&gt;     from the game options was &gt;USELESS.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Well, if it bugs you that much, you can start<br/>\n&gt; over again. But even if you<br/>\n&gt;     lose everything, at that low level you can just<br/>\n&gt; keep the character and just<br/>\n&gt;     build your items and such back up again. I<br/>\n&gt; recommend that you not carry<br/>\n&gt;     anything you really don&#39;t want to lose until you<br/>\n&gt; get level 6. Keep<br/>\n&gt;     everything else in the bank. Especially your<br/>\n&gt; money. Oh, and practice<br/>\n&gt;     foraging alot. It will help you later on in the<br/>\n&gt; game. Trust me. Begging is<br/>\n&gt;     not a good idea. Begging tend to piss people<br/>\n&gt; off. And you might want to<br/>\n&gt;     avoid orc camps at that level. at least stay<br/>\n&gt; close to the lift with a good<br/>\n&gt;     group and have someone to pull wandering orc<br/>\n&gt; cents. I think even some orc<br/>\n&gt;     pawns might give you xp at that level.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;Rob<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     You&#39;re welcome.<br/>\n&gt;     luv,<br/>\n&gt;     -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Visit the EverQuest homepage at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Your use of Yahoo!
