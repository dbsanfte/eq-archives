She gives you a letter to take to \n<div></div>&gt;Niola in the mage guild in Felwithe. \n<div></div>&gt;The details of the quest are at \n<div></div>&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=812 \n<div></div>&gt;The dress also drops off of creatures in befallen and unrest. But it doesn&#39;t \n<div></div>&gt;really look worth it. You can look up stuff that might be better than it and \n<div></div>&gt;easy to obtain. \n<div></div>&gt;luv, \n<div></div>&gt;-Su \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; hi, \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; I have Spent the last 4 days hunting in cb for a female elf slave in blue \n<div></div>&gt;dress to hand the task master earing to, but all i ever see are wood elf \n<div></div>&gt;type slaves, non in blue dress. Are the slaves in blue dress for real?, i \n<div></div>&gt;have searched every single spawn point for the slaves, even had them all \n<div></div>&gt;killed, and freed a whole bunch but no high elf slave ever spawns . is there \n<div></div>&gt;any other way to get the gossamer robe? I tried to buy it but no-one ever \n<div></div>&gt;seems to sell or advertise it for sale. \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; ------------------- \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Nuada \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; High Elf Mage -KIA- \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Druzzil Ro. \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt; \n <div></div></div><br clear=\"all\"><hr>MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href='http://g.msn.com/1HM505301/14'>Click Here</a><br></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
