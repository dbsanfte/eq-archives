What are other player&#39;s attitudes <br/>\ntoward game death?<br/>\n<br/>\nI play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on <br/>\nsince Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in <br/>\nawkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t just <br/>\ncall on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor do  <br/>\nhave high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big <br/>\nnasty.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the <br/>\nplace, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server. He <br/>\nis less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and tactics <br/>\nand utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the <br/>\nGuardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but enjoy <br/>\nmy independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career as <br/>\npossible. <br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
