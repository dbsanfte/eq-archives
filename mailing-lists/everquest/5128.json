It<br>lets you \n  add in your zip code to factor in shipping costs. It sorts by the<br>best \n  price and has customer ratings on the products as well as customer<br>ratings \n  of the stores that are offering it. So if the lowest priced store<br>has a bad \n  rating, you can choose to get one slightly more expensive at a<br>more \n  reliable store. I personally like yesmicro.com. I&#39;ve ordered from \n  them<br>numerous times. I think with yesmicro you get a discount if you order \n  a<br>product after locating it on www.pricewatch.com. I tend to look for it \n  on<br>pricegrabber then check for it on pricewatch. Another site for info \n  on<br>products is www.epinions.com. I tend to use all 3 to help determine \n  what<br>product I want.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
