Being a poor mage always soloing i forgot what team work <br/>\nis like, but you really need it in LDoN. I have won about 11 lost <br/>\nabout 5..and those losses resulted in fools for being in the <br/>\ngroup..so one word of advice for people never been in lost dungen.. <br/>\nbring your best friends and you will have a blast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
