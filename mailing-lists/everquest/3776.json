Not bad, but I am not making any money.<br/>\n<br/>\nPreviously I farmed Brutes in Warsliks Woods. Nominal experience, but <br/>\nmade lots of cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas where I can go as a lvl 35 Druid to get a good balance of <br/>\ncash/loot and experience? Mostly I solo, as I am usually in for an <br/>\nhour at a time. Get in a few hours together now and then, but for <br/>\nshort sessions getting a group consumes most of the time available.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
