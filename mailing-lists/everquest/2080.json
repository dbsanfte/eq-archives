All of us were \n    newbies once.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal \n    or Loot my corpse? The book<br>says no but I beg to differ.<br>&gt;Is it \n    possible that I had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I went back<br>with \n    a dead body I died again?&nbsp; &gt;Which meant I found the wrong \n    corpse?<br>&gt;<br>You must have found the second corpse. It can be tough \n    sometimes getting the<br>right corpse if you die more than once. And \n    sometimes if you don&#39;t have any<br>items other than foraged food, you lose \n    the foraged stuff anyways and just<br>get back the food you started with. Up \n    to level 5 I think you get your<br>food/drink and tome of discord back. I \n    think your starting weapon too.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;And to add one last question, \n    &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have no food,<br>no money, no nothing?&quot;&nbsp; \n    Do I &gt;beg or do I start another char?<br>&gt;This game is totally fun but \n    with the fact of trying to learn which way to<br>go all the time and dying, \n    it is starting &gt;to get to me,<br>&gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and \n    I turned to this board since the Chat<br>from the game options was \n    &gt;USELESS.<br>&gt;<br>Well, if it bugs you that much, you can start over \n    again. But even if you<br>lose everything, at that low level you can just \n    keep the character and just<br>build your items and such back up again. I \n    recommend that you not carry<br>anything you really don&#39;t want to lose until \n    you get level 6. Keep<br>everything else in the bank. Especially your money. \n    Oh, and practice<br>foraging alot. It will help you later on in the game. \n    Trust me. Begging is<br>not a good idea. Begging tend to piss people off. \n    And you might want to<br>avoid orc camps at that level. at least stay close \n    to the lift with a good<br>group and have someone to pull wandering orc \n    cents. I think even some orc<br>pawns might give you xp at that \n    level.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Please help and Thanks in \n    advance<br>&gt;Rob<br>&gt;<br>You&#39;re \n    welcome.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage \n    at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n    use of Yahoo!
