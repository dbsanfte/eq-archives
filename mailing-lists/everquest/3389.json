That means I only have to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-467094740\">Actually, my job is great for playing. I work 12 hour days, but only <br/>\nthree days one week and four the next, on two week pay periods. That <br/>\nmeans I only have to work 14 days a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside is that on work days I have time for work, eating, <br/>\ncommuting and sleeping, but for little else. I usually log on for <br/>\nabout one hour on those days and work on trade skills. Often too <br/>\ntired to do even that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the days off I am not babysitting my grandchildren I can have nice <br/>\nlong sessions. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for vacations, I earn vacation at a high rate and often have to <br/>\ntake days off just to burn the time. If I don&#39;t use it, I lose it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I take one of my three day weeks off I burn only 36 hrs. and get <br/>\n10 days off. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have the stamina to do 10 or 12 hr. sessions, but can do <br/>\nthree 3 hr. sessions a day on some days off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is great, but if I retire I can play all of the time. None of <br/>\nthat wasted time working. After a great many years of working I can <br/>\nsay definitively that work sucks. Gaming is far better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Toni &lt;silly_girl4ever@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  You could always do what my boyfriend does...
