I<br/>\nhad someone who wouldn&#39;t let me loot in group bc he claimed I was twinked. I<br/>\nwas around lvl 25 and wearing a Green Silk Drape and poking away with a<br/>\ndrachnid leg tip that I bought off a merchant in Neriak. I had no money bc<br/>\nI&#39;d spent it all on spells and the equipment that I had.<br/>\nSorry, pet peeve. The attitude that someone with good gear doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nmoney can get you into trouble.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nI made about 300pp in the Highpass Basement just looting everything because<br/>\neveryone else was so twinked they don&#39;t need money.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Su<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Friday, April 05, 2002 10:07 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] How do you make money?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Don&#39;t forget buffing for donations. At lvl 30 Rangers get sow. So you can<br/>\n  sow for donations if no druids, beastlords, or shamans are around.<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess the obvious ways I can think of are to kill lots of green mobs.<br/>\nCamp<br/>\n  items in dungeons. Practice trade skills. I have spent a great deal of<br/>\ntime<br/>\n  in the Highpass Basement and when I am in a group where everyone is<br/>\ntwinked,<br/>\n  they often let me get all the loot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
