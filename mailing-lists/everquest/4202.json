I played EQ since Beta <br/>\nand quit about 2 and half years ago (college took priority heh) and <br/>\nnow that I have secured a somewhat stable career, I&#39;m planning to hit <br/>\nonline RPGing again. Question is, being that EQ has been out for 5 <br/>\nyears, is it too late to come back and start anew? Meaning am I going <br/>\nto look ridiculous (prolly will regardless) being the only lvl 6 guy <br/>\non the server in cloth and using fine steel? Or should I look for <br/>\nanother MRORPG game? How is Camelot? Or Neverwinter Nights?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nYager</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
