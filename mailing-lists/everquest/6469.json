One of the reviewers<br/>\nmentioned a less expensive program (with better<br/>\nreviews) called Acronis True Image. I think I will<br/>\nlook into the abilities of the Acronis one to see if<br/>\nit would work for what I want to do. If not I may see<br/>\nabout going with Norton Ghost 10.0. I really really<br/>\nappreciate the info!<br/>\nI just need to remember to burn something to DVD to<br/>\nhelp restore windows XP in case there is a problem<br/>\nwhen I upgrade to the new mainboard setup.<br/>\nDirecway just sold out to Hughes.net and the service<br/>\nhas really declined. I keep having pages timeout when<br/>\nloading and get errors, their tech support no longer<br/>\nworks (can&#39;t get through to anyone), and my pop3 email<br/>\nno longer works (despite my following their tutorials<br/>\non setting it up). So I had to switch to using yahoo<br/>\nemail. bleh. I think its evident I&#39;m more than a teeny<br/>\nbit annoyed. <br/>\nThe bandwidth cap is a major pain. When I first signed<br/>\nup they said that unless I was constantly loading<br/>\nreally large files at a high rate of speed I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to worry about the cap. That was before they<br/>\nlowered the amount of bandwidth allowed before<br/>\ncapping. Loading a patch for EQ takes about 4 hours or<br/>\nmore. Its really annoying. I lose connection whenever<br/>\nit rains-- or sometimes when its bright and sunny for<br/>\nno apparent reason. I would not recommend this<br/>\n&quot;service&quot; to anyone. I had to call tech support sooo<br/>\nmany times that I memorized some of the routines and<br/>\nthen one of the techs in India started flirting with<br/>\nme (which was actually pretty funny).<br/>\nMan..

It will<br/>\n&gt; do exactly what you want it to do.  I&#39;ve used it<br/>\n&gt; several times on my own systems when installing new<br/>\n&gt; hard drives to set as primary.  Basically, what you<br/>\n&gt; do is install the new drive as a slave, completely<br/>\n&gt; wiped (you dont even have to partition it).  Then<br/>\n&gt; you install Norton&#39;s Ghost on your main drive.  Run<br/>\n&gt; Norton&#39;s Ghost and choose the option to do a direct<br/>\n&gt; ghost copy to the new drive.  Everything right down<br/>\n&gt; to the partitions will be copied to the new drive. <br/>\n&gt; Then you shut down the machine, switch the drive<br/>\n&gt; over to master and reboot.  Barring any major<br/>\n&gt; problems it&#39;ll boot up exactly as if it were the<br/>\n&gt; regular drive on that system.  Then you can take the<br/>\n&gt; original drive and wipe it and use it as a secondary<br/>\n&gt; for extra space.  It&#39;s a handy program.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your system sounds decent enough to run EQ albeit<br/>\n&gt; with some lag in the newer zones.  Turning off a lot<br/>\n&gt; of options might help that though.  However, on<br/>\n&gt; DirecWay I wouldn&#39;t expect too much.  DirecWay is<br/>\n&gt; bad about limiting the amount of data that can be<br/>\n&gt; sent at any given time.  If you send mroe than you<br/>\n&gt; are allowed to, they pretty much stop all<br/>\n&gt; communication and give you some stupid message about<br/>\n&gt; exceedxing the bandwidth.  Then it takes like 5<br/>\n&gt; minutes to reset.  You can look it up, the info is<br/>\n&gt; right there ont he DirecWay site.  That&#39;s why they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t reccomend using DirecWay for gaming.  But if<br/>\n&gt; all you want to do is browse the web and chat, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; fine.  If I can find the link, I&#39;ll post it for you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Su Johnston <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, April 23, 2006 6:42 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Does anyone solo anymore?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I have a Cleric. But I haven&#39;t actually gotten xp<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt;   over a year. I can&#39;t even get dialup where I live<br/>\n&gt;   because the phone company has spliced my lines so<br/>\n&gt;   badly I can&#39;t even dial out to an ISP. They refuse<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;   fix it and so far I haven&#39;t found any way to get<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt;   to. Too much other stuff to worry about frankly.<br/>\n&gt; Like<br/>\n&gt;   finding a lawyer to sue a doctor for malpractice,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;   still working on repairing hurricane Rita damage.<br/>\n&gt;   I currently have direcway Satellite-- which<br/>\n&gt; inherently<br/>\n&gt;   has latency. When I first got it with the Direcway<br/>\n&gt;   4000 2-way the bandwidth was 800k down and about<br/>\n&gt; 50k<br/>\n&gt;   up (allegedly 50k up-- clocked around 30k).<br/>\n&gt; Sometime<br/>\n&gt;   later when the modem died due to an incident with<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt;   cat and a glass of milk I got the newer Direcway<br/>\n&gt; 6000.<br/>\n&gt;   Direcway then dropped the bandwidth to 500k down<br/>\n&gt;   (without informing me). When I play world of<br/>\n&gt; warcraft<br/>\n&gt;   I generally have between 1200 to 4000ms latency.<br/>\n&gt; Last<br/>\n&gt;   time I tried to get into EQ it just kept timing<br/>\n&gt; out on<br/>\n&gt;   me.<br/>\n&gt;   As for my system, I have an AMD athlon thunderbird<br/>\n&gt;   1.4Ghz processor, 1GB of DDR SDRAM, ASUS A7M266-M<br/>\n&gt;   motherboard, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128Mb vid card, and<br/>\n&gt;   Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card.<br/>\n&gt;   I plan on upgrading to an ASUS A8V Deluxe (rev 2)<br/>\n&gt;   motherboard, 2Gb Kingston PC3200 ValueRAM, and AMD<br/>\n&gt;   Athlon 3500 2.0GHz processor (with venice core).<br/>\n&gt;   I will be using my same video card, sound card,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;   power supply (Antec SmartPower 2.0 450W) and<br/>\n&gt; adding an<br/>\n&gt;   additional 300Gb harddrive.<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m currently trying to figure out how to transfer<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt;   of my data from my puny primary drive and putting<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt;   on the 300Gb drive and setting it as primary, then<br/>\n&gt;   upgrading to the new mobo setup without having to<br/>\n&gt; use<br/>\n&gt;   a windows xp cd. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; restore<br/>\n&gt;   CDs for my pc bc it didn&#39;t come with any software<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt;   CDs. One of those deals where HP partitioned the<br/>\n&gt;   harddrive. Since the warrenty is up on it I doubt<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt;   could get tech support from them.<br/>\n&gt;   I wish I could figure out a way to just copy all<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt;   the programs so that they would be installable. I<br/>\n&gt;   should have an extra OEM of xp laying around<br/>\n&gt; somewhere<br/>\n&gt;   but it got lost in all the chaos of the hurricane.<br/>\n&gt;   luv,<br/>\n&gt;   -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   --- Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;   Su&gt; what class are you?

I assume you&#39;re on dial up in a rural area<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;   highs peed internet such as cable or DSL is not<br/>\n&gt;   available to you.

I know at one point I had a<br/>\n&gt;   PIII 800mhz system on an ISDN line and I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt;   TOO much lag.  But that was back when Kunark and<br/>\n&gt;   Velious were the newest expansions.  Now I have a<br/>\n&gt; P4<br/>\n&gt;   2.4 Ghz with 1GB RAM and a 256MB video card on a<br/>\n&gt; 5Mb<br/>\n&gt;   cable modem connection.
