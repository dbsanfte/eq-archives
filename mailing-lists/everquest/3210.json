I have been asked to tank and \npull occasionally which is alright, but I prefer a warrior, shadowknight or monk \nto pull whenever possible, they just seem better at it, tracking is kind of \nuseless in a crowded zone as whatever you are tracking might be taken by another \nplayer or group.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div>----- Original Message ----- </div>\n<blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"bigmaca3@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmaca3@...\">bigmaca3</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Friday, July 12, 2002 10:17 \nAM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Re: The boat to \n  Kunark</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@y\">EverQuest@y</a>..., \n  &quot;mlockridge01&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@c\">MLockridge01@c</a>...&gt; \n  wrote:<br>&gt; The other day I decided that a trip to Kunark was in order for \n  my <br>&gt; druid.
