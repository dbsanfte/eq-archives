Some are on upper floors, <br/>\nseldom visited. I usually only do this when there are not a lot of <br/>\npeople on, to reduce the probability of someone picking up my drop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get my twinker and twinkie in the same place, make the drop, log <br/>\ntwinker off, log twinkie on, make the pick up.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part I keep this in a rp mode by having twinkie and <br/>\ntwinker be cousins, one passing to the other such things as relatives <br/>\nmight to help each other out. No super-twinks. A bit of a push, but <br/>\nit works for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy primary and first alt are from Rivervale, and I found a few good <br/>\ntwink spots there as well. However, one of them I moved to Freeport <br/>\nand had bound there, so my higher level character visits him in <br/>\nFreeport from time to time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., D M &lt;sailorecko@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; how do you make a twinkie? what ways are there? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; yes I suck<br/>\n&gt; === message truncated ===<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Send your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.com\">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
