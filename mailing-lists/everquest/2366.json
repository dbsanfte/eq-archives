I created a Woodelf Ranger yesterday <br/>\nand planned to focus on this skill, but a friend has just told me <br/>\nthat Archery is broken and serves no purpose but to pull albeit from <br/>\ngreat distances.  I was hoping that a well developed archer, along <br/>\nwith snare could do most damage to mobs before its arrival.  If this <br/>\nnot true I find it staggering.  Its fine for casters to snare, DD and <br/>\nDoT - ie fighting from a distance, but not bow-wielders?  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any advice and general observations would be kindly met<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Legless, 8 Ranger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aka Rykk Bloodfang,  52 Monk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************************************************************<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\n&gt; intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\n&gt; are addressed.
