Was there anything different about the gnomes? Did they have red<br/>\ntext for their names?<br/>\nif not, then bug report it.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;   I play a level 16 barbarian shaman, and lately ive been trying to<br/>\n&gt; fight and level in Oasis of Marr.  Usually im in a group, and as<br/>\n&gt; happens when fighiting in Oasis, usually one or more of my party<br/>\n&gt; members gets rabies or is poisoned by whatever mob we are fighting at<br/>\n&gt; the time.  Since as a shaman i have Cure Disease (which cures rabies)<br/>\n&gt; and Cure Poison, i keep them memmed so that if a party member is<br/>\n&gt; poisoned or becomes rabid, i can cure them (most of the time, it<br/>\n&gt; works on the first cast, the second one if nothing else).  The other<br/>\n&gt; day, i was grouped with two gnomes, one a warrior and the other... i<br/>\n&gt; cant remember, but he was a gnome too, and another barbarian.  We<br/>\n&gt; were fighting a madman or zombie or something like that, and everyone<br/>\n&gt; but me got rabies.  I healed the barbarian of it no sweat, but i used<br/>\n&gt; up my entire mana bar trying to heal the gnomes!  For some reason, it<br/>\n&gt; wouldnt work, no matter how many times i cast it!  So i went to the<br/>\n&gt; dock and there were some other random people that were rabid too, and<br/>\n&gt; i healed them without a problem, but i still couldnt heal the<br/>\n&gt; gnomes!! Should i report this as a bug or is this just something that<br/>\n&gt; is the norm?  Help on this matter would be appreciated!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you sooooo much,<br/>\n&gt; Lorecie &lt;Vivix Protectorate&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 16th shaman<br/>\n&gt; Errolisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
