Will be<br/>\nsure not to do that again...and to whoever made the<br/>\ncomment about those who pay more SHOULD get the<br/>\nperks...you are right and I humbly beg forgiveness for<br/>\nvaluing &quot;loyalty&quot; over &quot;greed&quot;.  Not all who play are<br/>\nlucky enough to have bottomless BP&#39;s full of plat  :-P<br/>\n<br/>\nAmaiya<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I tried AO when it first came out.  It was so laggy<br/>\n&gt; you really <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t play.  I gave it 6 weeks and saw only minor<br/>\n&gt; improvements.  <br/>\n&gt; But the worst part were the missions all got boring.<br/>\n&gt;  Go here, kill <br/>\n&gt; this, sometimes bring it back, oh sorry that mission<br/>\n&gt; is broken, you <br/>\n&gt; get nothing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And you think Verant customer service is bad!  Read<br/>\n&gt; some of the AO <br/>\n&gt; sites.  You can find them on most of the major EQ<br/>\n&gt; sites.  These guys <br/>\n&gt; were terrible!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll stick with EQ.  No, I haven&#39;t seen a GM event<br/>\n&gt; in months, but on <br/>\n&gt; TT our GM&#39;s seem to be asleep at the wheel anyway. <br/>\n&gt; At least until <br/>\n&gt; Star Wars comes out... <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
