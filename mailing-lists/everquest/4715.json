Languages and <br/>\nother skills like 1 hb 2 hb and slashing can be trained way on past <br/>\n21 at your trainer depending on your level.  My druid has always used <br/>\na 1hb When I decided to het a scimitar at lv 48 I trained as high as <br/>\nI could and it was costing several plat a point  I paid over a <br/>\nhundred to gain skill level at trainer.  <br/>\n    I have been on almost 4 years and it has been this way the entire <br/>\ntime I have  played. I beleive the reason trade skills are capped at <br/>\n21 is to create player based economy for and to reward those willing <br/>\nto go out and put the work in something.<br/>\n                  My 2 copper,<br/>\n                              Hogg</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
