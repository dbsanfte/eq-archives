I have seen them do it at tech chats!<br/>\nAlot of people don&#39;t know that they are at risk. Maybe if Verant warned them<br/>\nit could happen they would know and understand how to protect themselves.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not their faults if they are ignorant of malicious hackers. Verant is<br/>\nNOT ignorant of it.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok I had never thought about getting my account &quot;hacked&quot; into.

The odds of anyone hacking your system.. or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>anyone else&#39;s system just to get your everquest account is next to nothing.<br/>\nSure it happens every now and then due to the lack of players realizing<br/>\ntheir personal responsibility to protect themselves on the Internet.  If<br/>\nyour handing your account information out to other players/not running<br/>\nuptodate anti-virus programs/personal firewalls/etc. then they have no one<br/>\nto blame but themselves.  There&#39;s certainly more personal information about<br/>\nthem that would be more important to &quot;hackers&quot; other then your Everquest<br/>\naccount.  Those protection programs are easy to install and maintain - most<br/>\nare automatic with the least amount of input from the end-user.  If someone<br/>\nis &quot;sniffing&quot; the packets from your computer, you&#39;ve got a much larger<br/>\nproblem then worrying if they have compromised your EQ account.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; D.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
