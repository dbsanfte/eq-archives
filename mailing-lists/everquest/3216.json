So, \n  death, especially death in <br>awkward circumstances, is more serious to my \n  character.

He \n  leaves corpses all over the <br>place, joins groups readily, and seems to have \n  great fun doing all <br>that.<br><br>My son, on the other hand, is in a \n  powerful guild on our server. He <br>is less cautious than me, but still uses \n  sound strategy and tactics <br>and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. \n  His guild is the <br>Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br><br>I figure I will have to \n  do the guild and group thing soon, but enjoy <br>my independence enough that I \n  want to do so as late in my career as <br>possible. <br><br>Barto Proudfoot \n  <br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
