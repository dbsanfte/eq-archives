But I am stuck. I use the diff. infomation and maps you can \n<div></div>&gt;find on the net as well as equipment list ect to help me find things \n<div></div>&gt;for quests ect. well I am stumped... \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;I am working on a High Elf Pally and am really enjoying building this \n<div></div>&gt;guy up. I started working on the Felwithe Defenders Falchion quest. \n<div></div>&gt;I am 8th level and the quest is rated 10th to 15th level.I started \n<div></div>&gt;the quest (talking to the Seria elf in the pally house) I killed the \n<div></div>&gt;masked spy and the Gen. Orc (with the help of a Dwarf with a Big \n<div></div>&gt;hammer.) (Note: the Spy and the Gen. Orc can be found talking \n<div></div>&gt;together at -2096.28, 2326.77 in Greater Faydark)and they can be \n<div></div>&gt;pulled with spells one at a time) I got their heads and turned them \n<div></div>&gt;in to Seria and got the dull sword I&#39;m to sharpen the sword, and turn \n<div></div>&gt;it in with some arborean amber and a P.forest drakeling scale to get \n<div></div>&gt;the first pally sword....well the dum sword will not sharpen, I use 1 \n<div></div>&gt;and 2 sharping stones, the sword and put them in the forge in the \n<div></div>&gt;armorer&#39;s shop and I&#39;m told &quot;these idems will not combine try another \n<div></div>&gt;forge...WHAT other forge?? My first ? is..is there another forge in \n<div></div>&gt;the high elf city and if so where or is it because I am only 8th \n<div></div>&gt;level? \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;my 2nd ? is on the first Pally armor quest where or what in the name \n<div></div>&gt;of all the good gods can I find or what is &quot;Brick of crude Bronze&quot; \n<div></div>&gt;and where can I find/make them (I need 2 for my first peace of armor) \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;Thanks \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;Slicesi \n<div></div>&gt;High Elf Pally \n<div></div>&gt;No Guild \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt; \n </span></blockquote><div></div></div><br clear=\"all\"><hr>Help STOP SPAM with <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://g.msn.com/8HMAEN/2016\">the new MSN 8 </a> and get 2 months FREE*</html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
