I play on the Tunare server. <br/>\n&gt; I have a 13 Iksar Monk<br/>\n&gt; but have been playing my 5 Wood Elf Ranger lately.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My ranger has a quiver that he keeps his arrows in. <br/>\n&gt; I saw a tip when I<br/>\n&gt; logged on that says keeping arrows in a quiver<br/>\n&gt; decreases attack time.  I can<br/>\n&gt; not get him to draw from his quiver.  The only<br/>\n&gt; arrows he uses are in the<br/>\n&gt; ammo slot.  The quiver will not fit in the ammo<br/>\n&gt; slot.  If I have no arrows<br/>\n&gt; in the ammo slot I get a message &quot;Out Of Ammunition&quot;<br/>\n&gt; when I try and use my<br/>\n&gt; bow, even with my quiver full.  I have tried putting<br/>\n&gt; the quiver on my back<br/>\n&gt; and it won&#39;t fit there either.  I have asked a bunch<br/>\n&gt; of people in game with<br/>\n&gt; no luck, searched the web and looked in my hint<br/>\n&gt; book.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While on the subject of archers, my bow and arrows<br/>\n&gt; each have a range and<br/>\n&gt; damage rating.  My bow is Range 75 Damage 8 (I<br/>\n&gt; think).  My arrows are Range<br/>\n&gt; 25 Damage 1.  What is my range and damage?  100 and<br/>\n&gt; 9 by adding the numbers,<br/>\n&gt; 25 and 1 taking the lower of each?  Something else?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://companion.yahoo.com/\">http://companion.yahoo.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
