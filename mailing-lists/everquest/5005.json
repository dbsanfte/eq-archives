The first part of the quest can be found at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1542\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1542</a><br/>\nYou have to do this quest twice to get 2 carapaces.....then smith the<br/>\ncarapaces with a tunic mold and nepeta oil, sold by Chialle near the bridge<br/>\nto shadeweavers, to make the bloodling mail.<br/>\nHand the tunic to Barkem to get the first hammer. Then you are assigned the<br/>\ntask of repairing the bridge guard shields.  Ask Barkem [What repair order]<br/>\nto get the order, then head to one of the two guards at the end of each<br/>\nbridge, Shadeweavers and Hollowshade.  Handing them the order gets you their<br/>\nshield. Take the shield and hammer and combine in a forge to get the<br/>\nrepaired shield, then hand the shield back to its owner before he respawns.<br/>\nhe will hand you a letter.  Once you do all 4 guards, the 2 at the end of<br/>\nshadeweavers and the 2 at the end of hollowshade, you will then be given an<br/>\nanvil and told to make shadow disks.  To make the disks you combine 1<br/>\nswirling shadow with 1 metal bit in a forge with the hammer and anvil.<br/>\nBarkem will hand you a box to put 10 in.  After that, you move on to the<br/>\nhumming orbs.  Handing Barkem 3 orbs plus your hammer gets you the hammer<br/>\nused to make shadowscream armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the substances, that requires running the war of hollowshade.  the<br/>\nbasics of the war is this.......<br/>\nEach camp has a trigger, for the grimling camp in the south its the Grimling<br/>\nChief, for the wolves east cave its Ghowlik, and for the owlbears its the<br/>\nnamed in back of the caves (was never good at remembering the bear<br/>\nnames....so oddballed.)  Killing this trigger usually sets off the enemy to<br/>\nattack them.  The war moves in one direction...the mobs controling the north<br/>\ncave always attacks the south camp, south camp always attacks the east cave,<br/>\nand east cave always attacks the north cave.  So to get a mob you want in<br/>\ncontrol of one area, you need to get them to the attacking camp, then<br/>\ntrigger them to attack the one you want them at.  Once a mob controls 2<br/>\ncamps however, if they are attacked they do not spawn defenders in the camp<br/>\nunder attack.  The substances you want will drop off the owlbears and sonic<br/>\nwolves once they take the south camp area, rarely they drop off the others<br/>\nbut its a once in a 100 kills.  South camp kills are one almost every other<br/>\nkill.  The wolves drop Shrieking substances, looks like a blueish green<br/>\nrock, and the owlbears drop wailing substances, looks like an orange orb.<br/>\nCombine 1 each of the substances with the hammer, anvil, one metal ring, and<br/>\nwater to make the orb, then combine the right number of orbs, swirling<br/>\nshadows, and mold to make shadowscream armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe info on the war is also listed at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1609\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1609</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe info on shadowscream armor is at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=128&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=lchain&menustr=080100120000\">http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=128&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=lchain&menustr=080100120000</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBtw...i had heard some trivs near lower 200s, but now see most trivs in<br/>\nhigher 200s</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
