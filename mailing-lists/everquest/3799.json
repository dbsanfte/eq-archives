Mod Rod change is probably the <br/>\nbiggest, considering that the high end Luclin encounters <br/>\nrely heavily on them (because the fights are too damn <br/>\nlong and take too much mana).  CH change doesn&#39;t really <br/>\neffect existing content, considering only a handful of <br/>\nplayers can get over the 7500hp mark.  Monks will have a <br/>\ntougher time pulling the big mobs in raids, but I&#39;m sure <br/>\nthat they will figure out a tactic to pull as well as <br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Manaburn.....well a few bad Wizards spoiled <br/>\neveryone&#39;s fun, although the change really doesn&#39;t hurt <br/>\nall that much.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
