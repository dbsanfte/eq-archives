I do havfe a question. No th Trade skills, Im understand most<br>of them, they&#39;re pretty straitforward...but I do have a question bout<br>the cooking one. Why? I understand smithing...get ore, make bars, make<br>weapons/armour...I know in EQ, every so many time units, you<br>automaticlly eat food. Since rations and milk will fill this funcion,<br>what is the purpose of cookin and brewing? Do you get more food value<br>out of something you&#39;ve made, as oppoised to the rations and bisquits?<br>Can you eat the food and get boosts from it? Same thing for the<br>brewing? Or is it just a vanity thing to be walking around with<br>something you cooked as opposed to the iron raions and milk thing...<br><br>The short answer is that higher level baked goods (e.g. Misty Thicket<br>Picnics) and brewed items (e.g. Qeynos Afternoon Tea) boost stats<br>significantly when consumed. <br><br>Trade skills get complicated at higher levels.... they are<br>interconnected. For example, in order to make a Misty Thicket Picnic,<br>which is baking, you need to be able to brew at a decent level to make<br>jumjum beer and also be able to tailor and do blacksmithing -- to make<br>the basket -- in addition to baking. Brewing also benefits fletching,<br>you need to brew oak bark tannin in order to *brew* light mithril<br>string, a component in high level wood elf cultural bows. And so forth.<br><br>Oh, yes, if you get to Level 250 and want to make your trophy, you<br>will also need a fairly good Jewelcrafting and Blacksmithing skill.<br><br>Froon<br><br><br><br><br></span></blockquote></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br>\n<div>&nbsp;</div></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td id=\"ygrps-yiv-1305284891INCREDIFOOTER\" width=\"100%\">\n<table cellSpacing=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"100%\"></td>\n<td id=\"ygrps-yiv-1305284891INCREDISOUND\" vAlign=\"bottom\" align=\"middle\"></td>\n<td id=\"ygrps-yiv-1305284891INCREDIANIM\" vAlign=\"bottom\" align=\"middle\"></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
