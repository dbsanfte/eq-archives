Also clean your phone jacks but do not use<br/>\nwater. :-)<br/>\nSometimes just pulling out the phone line and plugging it back in to the<br/>\njack can help improve the connection.<br/>\nI personally went to the trouble of getting special phone cords just for<br/>\nmodems. They were about $12 for 15 feet of cable. They really helped my<br/>\nconnection. They are much thicker than normal phone cords. There are also<br/>\nsome cords that have special coating to sheild them from electrical<br/>\ndischarge. Oh, magnets can screw up connections too. Anything with<br/>\nelectrical or magnetic (or both) fields can disrupt internet connections.<br/>\nRadios, speakers, and fans are common culprits. Even phones have magnetism.<br/>\nThat is why you should never ever ever set your phone down on a floppy disk<br/>\nunless you want the disk erased.<br/>\nOk, I&#39;ll shut up for real now.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
