This will help me alot!<br/>\nHow do I set up an attack macro that says something everytime I start to<br/>\nattack? Like if I want to say &quot;Don&#39;t run! We aer your friends&quot; when I begin<br/>\nattacking?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Su,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, there are always jerks.  Unfortunately, there are always<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fizzles.  And mobs hitting the cleric, etc. etc.  I don&#39;t have as good of a<br/>\nsolution to the jerks as was volunteered earlier(make a character on your<br/>\nserver and yell at the jerks you have to deal with), but I do have one to<br/>\nshow all in your group you are doing, or at least trying to do, your job as<br/>\na healer.  The solution is set up and use macros.  At level 28, I have two<br/>\nmain heal macros.  Each one states I am healing or greater healing the<br/>\nperson I have targeted.  It also tells them to stay close as sometimes folks<br/>\nwalk out of range of a heal.  This is my basic macro set up.  You have five<br/>\nlines to work with in a macro and my greater heal spell is in slot 1:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; /sit off<br/>\n&gt; /g Casting Greater Heal on %t.  Stay close friend.<br/>\n&gt; /cast 1<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I include /sit off so I can hit the macro whether I am medding or not.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The /g will groupsay whatever you want.  %t returns your target&#39;s name.<br/>\n/Cast 1 casts the spell in your first spell slot.  You can do /cast 1 to<br/>\n/cast 8 for any of your slots.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also have macros to state a mob is &quot;On me, can&#39;t heal&quot; or &quot;I just cast<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Divine Aura, I can&#39;t heal - get this mob off me&quot; or &quot;Zone zone zone.  Your<br/>\ncleric is on his way to zone!&quot;  By the way, I don&#39;t always run for zone, but<br/>\nit sure gets their attention that we might have a problem.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I find if you tell folks what you are doing, they stop asking.  Also, any<br/>\n </span></blockquote>time I med, I call out that I am medding and how much mana I have.  My macro<br/>\nfor that is:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; /book<br/>\n&gt; /g Medding.  My mana is at...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then I tell them 50% or whatever it happens to be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe some don&#39;t like the fact I say over and over again what I am doing,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but I find most appreciate it.  I can&#39;t please everyone.  And when someone<br/>\nasks why you Greater Healed so and so 4 times in a row, I say I didn&#39;t, I<br/>\nhad a bad fizzle streak.  They can see how quickly each of my healing<br/>\nmessages came and realize themselves what happened - a good thing.  Enough.<br/>\nToo much caffeine.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Robiinton<br/>\n&gt; Piemur<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
