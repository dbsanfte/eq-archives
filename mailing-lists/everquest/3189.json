I have been playing EQ since<br/>\nabout Nov of last year and have become adicted to it<br/>\njust like everyone else.  I have also been a member of<br/>\nthis group for awhile but never posted.  Have enjoyed<br/>\nalot of the info that has been put out there.  So I<br/>\nfigured it was time for me to come out of the shadows<br/>\nand let my voice be heard.  I been play on Brell,<br/>\nhaven&#39;t tried any other servers as of yet.  Have alot<br/>\nof friend on Brell in RL so tis why I stayed on there<br/>\nfor this long.  However I do have alittle bit of a<br/>\nquestion that I want to put out there.  I play a 36<br/>\nDrunken Chanter of Greenhall, am alittle tired of the<br/>\nKunark area and looking for some new places to hunt. <br/>\nEIther in groups or solo makes me no matter.  But I<br/>\nwould like to find a place that i can do both.  And<br/>\nyes this chanter still solos alot.  Although my guild<br/>\nleader doesn&#39;t like it, and she has even taken away my<br/>\nstaff so that I couldn&#39;t be a chanter tank anymore. <br/>\nhehe  What she doesn&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt me.  hehe <br/>\nAnyway, did alot of time in LOIO and FM and OT<br/>\nalready.  To break it up I even went to SK and soloed<br/>\nthe gnolls at the spires.  But now that I am 36 SK<br/>\njust won&#39;t do it much for now.  I do have a score to<br/>\nsettle with some giants in the Karanas though.  SO I<br/>\nwill be back.  But if anyone could shed alittle light<br/>\non some good places to group or solo til into the 40s,<br/>\nwith good xp.  Not saying I want to lvl every night in<br/>\none setting, those places would tend to be full of<br/>\ndeath also.  Just looking for some nice and calm pace,<br/>\nbut have alittle on the edge feel to it.  I get enough<br/>\nof that on raids.  And yes I do go on bigger guild<br/>\nraids then my lvl should let me, but then again I have<br/>\nthe safety of my guild and some of our allies there. <br/>\nSo if anyone is on Brell and wants to give me a shout<br/>\nout feel free.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZindi<br/>\n36 Drunken Chanter<br/>\nElder board for Guardians of Greenhall<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
