Sincerely, ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-252008542\">Greetings Tul,<br/>\nI&#39;m a little confused. Is there a website where you can buy the Muse EQ <br/>\nAtlas? Or is it free to download? I only want the best!<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nDeidre<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Muse at EQ Atlas makes the best maps I&#39;ve seen.  I have several<br/>\n&gt;notebooks full of them.  I doubt I&#39;ll buy Sony&#39;s version as I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;heard it&#39;s not as detailed or accurate.  Even if you buy it you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;still need EQ Atlas for those details.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also share many peoples disappointment in the name.  EQ Atlas is<br/>\n&gt;THE place to get maps.  Sony had many choices for names, and they<br/>\n&gt;knew how popular EQ Atlas is, so it seems they wanted to cash in on<br/>\n&gt;it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t buy it, it will be an excellent resource.  Just<br/>\n&gt;remember Muse when you need the real thing!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tul.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
