Most of the time when I group with monks, even if there is a<br/>\nwarrior they can maintain aggro and I just keep healing. Only works when I<br/>\nhave C3 though. Works a little better now that I have my 7th shawl bc the<br/>\nflowing thought stacks with KEI. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nI was talking about monks when I said that it isnot the warriors job to keep<br/>\naggro off of them. In some of them more complicated encounters, this is the<br/>\nhardest part, keeping the mob off the first mob in the rotation. I play a<br/>\ncleric also :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAwulfie A&#39;Mused<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.551 / Virus Database: 343 - Release Date: 12/11/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
