I had people laughing at me when I was in my 40s and \n  50s level range because I wanted to melee a bit and let the mobs try to hit me \n  to make my defense go up. They said I would never need defense and I didn&#39;t \n  need to worry about it. However, being able to dodge hits can really come in \n  handy and sometimes I have had to melee mobs to death when oom and having to \n  kill a mob that is running away. A single bash can be the difference between \n  killing a mob and getting a ton of adds.<br>-Su<br><br>======== At 2004-12-18, \n  11:03:00 you wrote: ========<br><br>Skills, skills, skills, skills, skills, \n  skills, skills!<br><br>I hate to be the one to say this but you really should \n  focus on your <br>battle skills. Trust me, at the lower levels that is a \n  perfect time to <br>get the skills built up. I can understand wanting to go in \n  and just beat <br>the heck out of everything and being uber and killing it all \n  in one <br>shot. But ponder this, When you get to be up in levels (50&#39;s, 60&#39;s, \n  and <br>70&#39;s) you are going to be taking on some majorly nasty monsters. If \n  you <br>have just gained levels and have an uber weapon but never really \n  worked <br>on your fighting skills and they are low, it&#39;s not going to help \n  you or <br>your party out very much. Actually you will hurt your group more \n  than <br>help them. Now being a Shammy you have some awesome spells at higher \n  <br>levels. This is another thing I would suggest focusing on. If your at a \n  <br>higher level and your fighting say a dragon and 60% of your casts fizz \n  <br>then you may as well run or be able to hit! (See first part) otherwise \n  <br>your gonna get killed or your group killed.<br><br>That&#39;s just my 2 \n  cents.<br><br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
