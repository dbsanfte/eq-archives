They&#39;re constantly nerfing everything<br/>\ningame<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s worth while, or ignoring classes that need to be balanced or<br/>\n&gt; upgraded! So in retrospect, I&#39;m looking to find greener pastures<br/>\nelsewhere.<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps someone out there knows of another game (other than AC and UO) or<br/>\n&gt; perhaps a group who&#39;s programming their own game similar to EQ? If so,<br/>\n&gt; please don&#39;t hesistate to drop me a line or two via email.
