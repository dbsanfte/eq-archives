","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-152745600\">The boats are really slow and awkward to use. You are<br/>\nbetter off swimming. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as plat.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Buy 2 opal encrusted steins to boost your charisma<br/>\nwhen selling. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Farm fine steel weapons. They sell for around 5pp<br/>\nwith 105 charisma to vendors. Places to farm FS<br/>\ninclude Sol A, Lower Guk, Runnyeye etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Acrylia caverns in velious. Farm fine steel, velium<br/>\nblocks, spider silk, gems etc.  Sell velium and silk<br/>\nto players in bazaar. On Vazaelle you can sell velium<br/>\nblocks of various sizes from 40pp to 90pp per block.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. LDON adventures yield good plat and you gain exp at<br/>\nthe same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Loy. Go to Dulak&#39;s harbor and kill pirates. They<br/>\ndrop 4-5 pp plus weapons that sell for around 5pp to<br/>\nvendors and the occasional high-end gems. Diamonds,<br/>\nblue diamonds etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n6. Farm tradeskill items. Spider silks sell for around<br/>\n20-30pp per stack. Spiderling silks for around the<br/>\nsame. Animal pelts sell pretty good too. For spider<br/>\nsilks hunt crag spiders in east karana. Kill<br/>\nspiderlings in everfrost or innothule swamp. For pelts<br/>\nmy favorite place is the karanas and stonebrunt<br/>\nmountains.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
