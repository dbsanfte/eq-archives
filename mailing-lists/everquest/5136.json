Usually doesn&#39;t require any extra software, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; easy to configure, and most of them have built in firewalls.    I&#39;ve never<br/>\n&gt; heard of SyGate, but Windows ME/XP both have something called Internet<br/>\n&gt; Connection sharing which essentially sets up a proxy server ont he host<br/>\n&gt; machine and allows all the others to connect through it.  I used it before<br/>\n&gt; and its okay but a little tempermental at times when you start adding 3rd<br/>\n&gt; party firewall software to the mix.  I&#39;d still reccomend going with a<br/>\n&gt; router.  Small 4 port routers aren&#39;t that expensive.  You can pick them up<br/>\n&gt; at Best buy or Comp USA for less than $60.
