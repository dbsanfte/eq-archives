I hate the standing in line<br/>\nfor a camp shit, what&#39;s the adventure about that? Although new zones are<br/>\ncoming and the update that is due in march will HOPEFULLY boost this game to<br/>\nnew levels, I am hoping for an entirely new continent, a few new<br/>\nraces/classes, perhaps a better graphics engine, enhanced quest system etc<br/>\netc, and a bundle of new features, perhaps even mounts for traveling etc..<br/>\nThey have alot of time to work on this upgrade and since they aren&#39;t doing a<br/>\nreally great job at keeping the running game up to date I pray that they are<br/>\nspending all efforts on the upgrade.. We shall wait and see.. Meanwhile I am<br/>\ngoing to play my character slow and easy like I have from the start, I might<br/>\nnot reach level 50 until it&#39;s time for the upgrade but all the better, I<br/>\nwon&#39;t be bored with the game too soon.. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Avron -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: William Orent &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:will8155@...\">will8155@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 9:39 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Fed up with EQ - any ideas??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: William Orent &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:will8155@...\">will8155@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When you&#39;re looking at EQ you have to realize something, its part of the<br/>\nfirst<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in a long line of games to come. EQ, AC, and UO were pretty much the<br/>\nfirst in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this genre, and like that will very soon not fit the players needs. As<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people play more and more, they expect more and more from the game.<br/>\nConey Island<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was originally a huge attraction because of its many many lights,<br/>\nhowever, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people began demanding more and more. EQ, UO, and AC in this genre you<br/>\ncould<br/>\n&gt; &gt; relate pretty much to doom in the 1st person shooter genre. Things will<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; build from here, as the players demand more and more, the companies will<br/>\nproduce<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bigger and better games trying to fit the players demands. Am I saying<br/>\nthat EQ<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is no longer worth playing, no. EQ is a really great game, and despite<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; debate as to whether the changes within it are good or bad, it still<br/>\nattracts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many people. However, EQ is a dying game, I personally do not intend to<br/>\ngive up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on it because it satisfies my needs in gaming for now, however the<br/>\ncompanies,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seeing that this is a very good market will keep releasing bigger and<br/>\nbetter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; games. I imagine there to be a flood of titles coming in, and within a<br/>\nyear or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so, one of them will fight its way to the top, such as half life, or<br/>\nunreal in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the 1st person shooter genre. EQ isn&#39;t any worse then when people first<br/>\nstarted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playing and loved it. The thing is that the players demands are<br/>\nincreasing more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and more, and EQ is striving to keep up. The only question is, how long<br/>\ncan it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; last?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
