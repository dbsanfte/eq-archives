I don&#39;t <br/>\nrecall if it is just called options or what. Just look at all of them <br/>\nand one will have a keyboard tab. The mapping is done there. Was a <br/>\nwhile ago on the old UI that I did it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt does tie up a hot button. If I recall the way my son set it up, <br/>\nthe top right button in the hot button box, f2, became automatically <br/>\nlinked to the right turn button. That way whatever you wanted to have <br/>\nassigned to go off whenever you turn right could be put on that <br/>\nbutton.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously that can be good or bad. Put a spell there and you could <br/>\nend up in some ugly fights. Put something like forage or sense <br/>\nheading and you up that skill quickly. With forage, however, you end <br/>\nup with roots and vegitables all over your cursor all of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Claude P Perry II&quot; &lt;crhydderch@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hey Barto, how did you map the sense heading to  your right turn <br/>\nkey?  and<br/>\n&gt; does this free up hotkey space for other things?  Reason I ask this <br/>\nis I was<br/>\n&gt; taught by a friend to have the Hotkey for sense heading to be in <br/>\nthe  first<br/>\n&gt; space next to  my combat key like taunt or kick or bash depending <br/>\non  my<br/>\n&gt; character that way I can increase sense heading skill while in <br/>\ncombat.<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What my son and I did was to map the hot key to the right turn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; button. Every time we turn right, we sense heading. Builds <br/>\nskill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quickly. Can be done for foraging, as well, but you end up <br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on your cursor as you run around.
