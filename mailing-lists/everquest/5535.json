Now someone has thrown me another mystery to solve. A <br/>\nplayer sent me the following words:<br/>\n&quot;Link your wep pls?&quot;<br/>\nOk. I figured out that a wep is a weapon. When I asked him what he meant, <br/>\nhe said that he wanted to link with my hammer. I have an Intel&#39;s Hammer. <br/>\nHowever, I have no idea what he means by linking him to it or how to do it. <br/>\nSomebody please throw this poor newbe a clue. G.
