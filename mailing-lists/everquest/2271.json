Ive paid <br/>\nfor a tp myself, sometimes more than usual to get out of a place i <br/>\njust cant stand (like yesterday.. i was hunting in Lake of Ill Omen <br/>\nand someone was doing a raid for their monk epic, and everyone was <br/>\nshouting and /oocing and even /auctioning and when i asked them to <br/>\ntone it down to one channel because not everyone in the zone was on <br/>\nthe raid, i was rudely told to shut up and the less i whined the <br/>\nfaster they would be done) or if im despreate and someone&#39;s switched <br/>\ncharacters just to port me somewhere.  On the SoW part of the idea, i <br/>\nthink that taking a donation for a sow is all right, like when you&#39;re <br/>\nin the middle of a fight and someone comes up asking for one,  or if <br/>\nyour in a group and really low on mana and someone comes up and wants <br/>\none, or when all you hear is &quot;can i have sow?&quot; &lt;cast spell&gt; &quot;ooh! <br/>\nshes casting sow!!&quot; &lt;the whole durn zone comes running over&gt; &quot;can i <br/>\nhave sow?&quot;  I finally put my character on Roleplay mode (full anon is <br/>\nnot allowed by my guild) so people wouldnt ask me as often.  <br/>\nOccasionally i have the random &quot;you are being inspected&quot; and then i <br/>\nget asked for it (my weapon is shm only so its kind of a giveaway if <br/>\nyou know my wep), and ill always cast it for corpse runs for people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA slightly different subject now... Can anyone suggest a good surname <br/>\nfor my shammie?  Her name&#39;s Lorecie, at the rate im going i&#39;ll be 20 <br/>\nby the end of the month and i want a surname hehehe.  Also am looking <br/>\nfor suggestions for my fiancee (both in game and real life) for his <br/>\ncharacer... so i&#39;ll be taking his surname on soon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any suggestions and my random ranting about the jerks in <br/>\nLoIO.<br/>\n<br/>\nLorecie &lt;Vivix Protectorate&gt;<br/>\n18th shaman<br/>\nErolissi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Jeff Gaudry &lt;bgrifter@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to me. Sure, I sometimes get stiffed and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get something I can&#39;t use as a tip, but for the most<br/>\n&gt; &gt;part I think I have been well rewarded. For me <br/>\n&gt; &gt;it is in character and adds to the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think i&#39;m coming to the conclusion that a Druid<br/>\n&gt; should less demand payment for a TP, than players<br/>\n&gt; should feel that the right thing to do is to donate<br/>\n&gt; what they can for one. :) As someone who&#39;s taken quite<br/>\n&gt; a few, I always make sure I have the standard 10pp<br/>\n&gt; available to offer, it&#39;s just the right thing to do<br/>\n&gt; for the investment of time being given for the other<br/>\n&gt; player. I don&#39;t think i&#39;d stand there once my druid<br/>\n&gt; can group TP and demand payment, but watching that<br/>\n&gt; twinked level 12 with better equipment than I have go<br/>\n&gt; on about how broke he is might be a little hard to<br/>\n&gt; swallow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; Web-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
