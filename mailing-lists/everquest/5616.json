I was in a group of 5 where suddenly we lost two people \n  (before even getting to adv start) and then the other two folk decided to bag \n  the adventure. So, just for Ha-Has, I took my shaman into the adv to do some \n  foraging (some of the rarer forages sell for 50-100pp a pop on the Nameless). \n  Lack of common sense got the better of me and I tried some of the mobs... the \n  first multi-pull sent me running for the exit... :)<br><br>Ciao,<br>Miracht \n  Riversfriend,<br>51 Shaman, The Nameless<br>Champions of Cabilis<br>&gt; \n  Message: 3<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 00:48:39 -0700 \n  (Mountain Standard Time)<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From: &quot;flaumigevylke&quot; \n  &lt;flaumigevylke@...&gt;<br>&gt; Subject: Re: \n  Adventuring<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Well first you have to make sure you have the \n  expansion Lost Dungeons of<br>&gt; Norath, once you have that then you join a \n  band of adventures of around your<br>&gt; level, maximum of 6 member with a \n  spread of no more then 7 levels between<br>&gt; the highest and lowest. The \n  group leader then goes and gets the adventure<br>&gt; for the group, sorry but \n  they won&#39;t let a solo in and you all have to have<br>&gt; the expansion \n  enabled and have your adventure stones. Just one way they have<br>&gt; of \n  making you group with people to have fun and see naked as someone<br>&gt; \n  possibly all of you will die on it at some time or another. You&#39;ll have \n  a<br>&gt; main looter who loots and then sells after the adventure and splits \n  the<br>&gt; proceeds between you all, items drop from the mobs which are no \n  drops and<br>&gt; you roll on them, there&#39;s also some pretty nice things drop \n  that you&#39;ll want<br>&gt; to roll on.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  Flaumigavylke<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Quellious<br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the \n  EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
