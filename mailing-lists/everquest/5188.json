It was a series of comic strips<br/>\n&gt; based on EverQuest that I thought was really well<br/>\n&gt; done.  I had intended on posting the link to this<br/>\n&gt; list, but never did.  Now I&#39;m trying to find the<br/>\n&gt; link again but I cant remember how or where I found<br/>\n&gt; it.  So I was hoping that maybe someone here might<br/>\n&gt; know what I&#39;m talking about.  Essentially the comic<br/>\n&gt; strip starts out with a female wood elf turning in<br/>\n&gt; her quest paper to become a druid, but some things<br/>\n&gt; happen and she ends up being taken under the wing<br/>\n&gt; (?) of an Iksar who was a friend of her father.  The<br/>\n&gt; Iksar character is named after the person&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; character who draws the strip.  Hopefully this is<br/>\n&gt; enough information that someone might recognize it<br/>\n&gt; and post the link.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
