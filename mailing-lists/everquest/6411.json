Whenever you are <br/>\nlow on mana, every spell fizzles. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen in doubt, gate. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is not a single bathroom in all of Norrath. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Armor Class of a piece of armor is inversely proportional as to <br/>\nhow good it looks on you. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe item that you want the most drops the rarest. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe item that you want the most is out of your price range. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe item that you want the most was sold at an auction while you <br/>\nwere offline. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe item that you want the most was picked up by some moron who <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know the definition of &quot;No Drop&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe item you&#39;ll need tomorrow is No Rent. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe item you accidentally drop will be the most <br/>\nvaluable/powerful/important item you carry. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can afford it, it&#39;s not for sale. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want two of them, it&#39;s a Lore item. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to sell it, it&#39;s a No Drop item. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe High Quality Bear Skin drops every 28 days, the same schedule as <br/>\nPMS. Coincidence? <br/>\n<br/>\nEven greens kill. <br/>\n<br/>\nBackstab means never having to say you&#39;re sorry. <br/>\n<br/>\nA bow without arrows seems awfully heavy all of a sudden. <br/>\n<br/>\nMerchants are perfectly capable of kicking tail and taking names. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrains have the right of way. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s stupid but it works, it isn&#39;t stupid. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe guards are never there when you need them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMisuse of a combine button in a hurry = highly colorful language. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe time it takes to upload the newest patch is directly <br/>\nproportional to your eagerness to log on. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo two people have ever agreed on a single, precise definition of a <br/>\ntwink. <br/>\n<br/>\nNever forget that your newbie weapon was crafted by the lowest <br/>\nbidder. <br/>\n<br/>\nA roleplayer drinks to increase his alcohol tolerance; an idiot does <br/>\nit in the Kelethin treetops. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a tenth of a bubble of health left is Nature&#39;s way of telling <br/>\nyou to slow down. <br/>\n<br/>\nGnome wizards are proof positive that size does not matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe greatest mystery in Norrath is how NPCs figure out what religion <br/>\nyou are just by looking at you. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery shaman on Norrath at one point in his or her life has done the <br/>\npig joke when someone asked for a SOW. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnly twelve people in all of Norrath are truly happy with their last <br/>\nnames. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe last bubble takes forever to fill. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is somehow discouraging to realize that Qeynos is &quot;SonyEQ&quot; <br/>\nspelled backwards.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
