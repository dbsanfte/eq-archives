Comegys [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:comegys@...\">comegys@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 25, 2001 1:33 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Druid question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found www.eqdruids.com to be an invaluable resource.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what they say in the Battle Tactics section; it pretty much agrees<br/>\nwith what Su said, but gives a slightly different perspective. This is a<br/>\ndirect cut and paste from the web page, so please don&#39;t flame me for the<br/>\nslightly offensive language contained herein.<br/>\n<br/>\n********<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been sent many emails on both sides of the coins on animal slaughter<br/>\nfor druids...here are the FACTS...role play to what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only animals you SHOULD NOT kill due to faction hits are the bears<br/>\ninside the city of Sure Fall Glades.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you kill animals near certain NPCs (Holly...bitch) and other rangers and<br/>\ndruid NPCs throughout various zones, they will assist the animal and kick<br/>\nyour butt.  You do not suffer a faction hit for this combat, just a corpse<br/>\nretrieval.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flip side, animals are the only way to obtain pelts and skins.  In<br/>\naddition at some levels they are the only obvious choice in killing for<br/>\nexperience.  In addition we have four lines of spells devoted to jacking<br/>\nwith animals.  To me it is clear that game intends for druids to whack on<br/>\nanimals with no remorse.  Many people feel this is against their own sense<br/>\nof role-playing a druid.  It is important to note that many monsters who we<br/>\nwould consider an &#39;animal&#39; are not (i.e. spider variants).   The best way to<br/>\ntell is to try to cast a charm animal variant spell on them and see if you<br/>\nget a message about only being able to cast on animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a player, I prefer to kill MOBs that have loot that is worth messing<br/>\nwith.   With the exception of ruined pelts at low levels, I have found<br/>\nanimals to be not worth the monetary effort (well mammoth tusks and grif<br/>\nfeathers are nice).<br/>\n<br/>\nDo as you will, but I think that you will get very little reward for NOT<br/>\nkilling animals and your experience on Norrath will be more difficult as<br/>\nmany of your spells will go unused.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever in the sense of a druid is a protector of nature, make sure players<br/>\n(and yourself) clean up all corpses so they don&#39;t lay around to decay, also<br/>\nuse anything you pick up of a corpse, don&#39;t just dump it on the ground.  In<br/>\nmy sense of role-playing, Norrath will ALWAYS spawn more monsters than<br/>\nplayers can wipe out, so my job is to help maintain an effective balance...<br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor<br/>\nlvl 36 Wood Elf Druid<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
