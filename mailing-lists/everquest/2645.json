My choice of a druid helped in this. Knowing I would be <br/>\ninto the game often but for relatively short periods of time was my <br/>\nprimary reason for focusing on the solo arts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found ghouls to be profitable as they often dropped bronze items. <br/>\nNow I often hunt aviaks in sk, as they have good cash drops and also <br/>\ndrop bronze. There are lots of wanderers in sk, so easy to solo <br/>\nwithout the inconvenience other birds jumping in as at kfc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also bag wandering gnolls in sk. I do occasionally join a spire <br/>\ngroup to get lots of gnoll loot, but have found aviaks give me better <br/>\ncash flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I get bored with the routine of birding, I go look for a spawn <br/>\nsomewhere on my item wish list. Don&#39;t really camp them, just pop in <br/>\nto see if they are up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nlvl 31 Druid<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;J.
