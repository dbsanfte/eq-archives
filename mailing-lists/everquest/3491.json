I<br/>\nhad some Mouse issues but I solved those but now I get<br/>\na little skip in the movement when I run or walk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is like frame by frame.  The machine is a 1.2 GHZ<br/>\nmachine with 384 Ram and 32 MB video card.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my question is, &quot;Does the video card with EQ make<br/>\nthe difference or is it RAM?&quot;  The reason I ask is<br/>\nbecause when you choose the Luclin images it tells you<br/>\nhow many to pick based on Ram and not Video memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo does EQ use RAM more so than Video ram or not?<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind getting a 64 MB video card but I want it<br/>\nto work.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend also sees the same issues but only has 256<br/>\nmb ram<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
