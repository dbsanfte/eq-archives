Actually I&#39;m tooling down my list of<br/>\ncharacters that I play. Frankly I really only play a couple of them half<br/>\nthe time, my Ranger and my Magician.  <br/>\n\tMy &quot;break&quot; was for about 10 months. I had gotten into another<br/>\ngame called Motor City Online which was fun but lacked the<br/>\n&quot;personalities&quot; of EQ. SO I&#39;m back and having fun again, I have all this<br/>\nweek off so I&#39;m doing some major playing! <br/>\n<br/>\nSteve<br/>\n(Durgaa: Wood Elf Ranger lvl 9)<br/>\n(Shizney: Gnome Magician lvl 4)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
