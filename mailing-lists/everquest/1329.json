I&#39;m running around<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; no armor and just the weapon I started with... I got to lvl 2 just turning<br/>\n&gt; in bardic mail without having to kill anything. Then some guy walks up and<br/>\n&gt; hands me 2pp. I reluctantly took it. Then another guy came up and gave me<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; Shiny Brass Shield. At first I tried to refuse but then figured I could<br/>\n&gt; give<br/>\n&gt; it to one of my mom&#39;s alts. Then some guy started offering me splitpaw<br/>\n&gt; armor. I tried to pay him for it but he wouldn&#39;t let me. So I ended up<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; all this stuff by lvl 3... The gnoll hide lariat rules though.
