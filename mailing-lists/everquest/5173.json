One good method I saw a druid using was<br/>\nto snare a mob then cast camo on herself and run back to the bridge. That<br/>\nway other mobs didn&#39;t see her running.<br/>\nAlso, if you can use the spell to charm an animal you can charm a wolf or<br/>\nkitty to help you. Only problem is when charm wears off. If things go bad<br/>\nyou can run accross the bridge to zone.<br/>\nI believe I hunted in DL at that lvl, but I&#39;m a cleric so I couldn&#39;t solo.<br/>\nIf you have Lost Dungeons of Norrath it&#39;s really great xp. I know you can&#39;t<br/>\nsolo, but the xp in group is worth it.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my friend says that other ppl told her to solo in eastern wastes......<br/>\n </span></blockquote>shes the same lvl and a dru!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -lori<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Masteradept &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:masteradept007@...\">masteradept007@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Ok I&#39;m asking the question....I&#39;m a 46 druid...and I&#39;m wondering<br/>\n&gt; where you guys would solo at this point.
