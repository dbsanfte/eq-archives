Mind you, <br/>\nyou won&#39;t get attacked if you practice your begging on:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. your pet<br/>\n2. NPC that don&#39;t attack, like those in POK<br/>\n3. Boats.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, certain classess use begging better than others - for instance <br/>\nBard/Rogue are better at begging than the other classes (I think <br/>\nRogue is the only one to be able to reach 200, but I&#39;m at work so I <br/>\ncan&#39;t check right now).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMax out CHA (the stat that affects Begging), and get a skill of 200 <br/>\nin Begging - and walla, you have a pretty safe way to get a few gold, <br/>\non occassion a plat or two.  Of course, this takes forever, but if <br/>\nyou have nothing better to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts a lot like Alcohol tolerance, some people think its useless, but <br/>\nsome people try drunken fighting anyways, and like it - though I have <br/>\nnot personally seen much impact on the melee classes in my groups <br/>\nwhen they do or do not use it (other than the occasional running in <br/>\ncircles thing).  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever a much better way to use begging is actually as a minor <br/>\ntaunt.  Its not Perfect, but if you can set a hot key up to turn off <br/>\nauto attack, beg, then auto attack, you can use it as a mini taunt - <br/>\nsince they are already mad at you - they might turn their attention <br/>\nto you (of course, if you don&#39;t have taunt to begin with, you <br/>\nprobably shouldn&#39;t be tanking, but I&#39;ll let you make that decision).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
