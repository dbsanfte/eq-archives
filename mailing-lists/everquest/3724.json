Since both of you said it, I&#39;m more likely to remember it when I&#39;m<br/>\nhelping my mom do her shammy&#39;s epic.<br/>\nRight now I need to start on my own epic. People would love me if I had a<br/>\nclick stick. And it would save so much mana. I swear I would rez anyone who<br/>\nhelped me for free forever. Oh wait, I rez most people for free anyways. I<br/>\nnever ask for donations for it. I just occassionaly accept donations. If the<br/>\nperson is a friend I refuse donation. And if it was a really easy rez or I<br/>\nfound the body or just offered to go do the rez without being asked I refuse<br/>\ndonation. Which would explain why I have no money. lol. I know, I&#39;m not the<br/>\nmost aggressive or best player, but I enjoy the way I play.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Doh<br/>\n&gt; had I read further I woulda seen that Orion already posted the invis to<br/>\n&gt; Animal thingy lol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Halyburton<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Orion&quot; &lt;orionv@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That one is very long and boring but I did learn that there actually is a<br/>\n&gt; use for that Invis to Animals spell we get.
