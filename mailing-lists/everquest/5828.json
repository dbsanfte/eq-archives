I think it is<br/>\nbecause we are disillusioned from what SOE originally touted it as - a way<br/>\nto gain xp for people who don&#39;t have very long to play and unable to find<br/>\ngroups.  It&#39;s not like that at all.  Tasks should be simple, quick, and<br/>\neasy.  They should not require hours of your time and the need of a full<br/>\ngroup to accomplish.  I&#39;ve only done the one task, but it took me the better<br/>\npart of 4 hours.  Had it not been for several others in the zone working on<br/>\nthe same or similar quests, I never would have finished it.  Another beef I<br/>\nhave is that not all the information is presented to you when you get the<br/>\ntask.  When I accepted it, it said I must kill 10 reanimated creatures in<br/>\nchardok and loot 4 bone chips.  That&#39;s it, nothing more.  Once I had<br/>\ncompleted the task, I thought I was supposed to go turn the bone chips into<br/>\nthe same guy I had gotten the task from, but no, now new information was<br/>\nshowing, saying that I had to go find some guy in Burning Woods and hand the<br/>\nbone chips to him!  Why couldn&#39;t it have said that from the start and I<br/>\ncould have saved myself A LOT of time!  Finding him was no easy task either<br/>\nsince BW is a big zone.  So I think unless SOE revamps the task system to be<br/>\nmore commensurate to what they stated it would be, many people won&#39;t be<br/>\ndoing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWulfric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Dave Lyles&quot; &lt;dwlyles@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;EverQuest@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 23, 2004 9:56 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Task system<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The only task I could get was the dreadlands as well.

My 49 ranger<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; advised by the task masters to go to Rathe Mountains for a task. I did,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything was pointing me to Lower Guk. I&#39;ve never really been through<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Upper and Lower Guk, and going that far underground with a ranger just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; makes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me concerned.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I abandoned the task. The next thing I tried was getting a task from a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; task<br/>\n&gt; &gt; master in Overthere. It sent me into Burning Woods, where one of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I had to do was enter the giant fort and scout it out. To accomplish<br/>\nthat,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discovered I had to run into the middle of the fort. I was invisible,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; soon as I got within agrro range, I started wailed on by a giant.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thankfully, a group was pulling giants from the fort, so it was somewhat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; abandoned. I trained a giant or two out and ran for the zone line. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; next<br/>\n&gt; &gt; step is to kill 10 skeletons (can&#39;t remember exactly what type, but I<br/>\nknow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they con dark blue -- not sure how well bow-kiting will work in such a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; busy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zone).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Frustrated with such difficult and dangerous tasks for my 49 ranger, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a task with 10 cleric. I was sent into Innothule Swamp from a PoK task<br/>\n&gt; &gt; master and told to kill 10 bull alligators (most con white, some a<br/>\nhealthy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dark blue). I had to run for my life and died about 10 feet from the PoK<br/>\n&gt; &gt; book. I didn&#39;t realize bull alligators helped each other out. I got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trounced<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by two of them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m becoming increasingly convinced that tasks are not soloable. :(<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Nick Thompson [mailto:poolsharkbc@...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The only place that would give me a task was in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dreadlands, and it sent me ( a 52 Druid) into Chardok<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for a recon mission.  Thought it couldn&#39;t be that bad,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I had never been to Chardok before.  The mission<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was to enter the fort inside Chardok and explore the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; area around the first bridge.
