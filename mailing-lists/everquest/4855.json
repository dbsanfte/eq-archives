I just thought I&#39;d introduce myself to everyone and give a little<br/>\n&gt; background info about myself.  Well I&#39;ve been playing EQ for about 2<br/>\nyears<br/>\n&gt; now and I love it.  I play on Ayonae Ro and my main is a 29 troll<br/>\nwarrior<br/>\n&gt; and I also have a 25 iksar necro, 12 human monk, and the rest of my<br/>\n&gt; characters are just throw away ones, I wanted to experiment to see<br/>\nhow the<br/>\n&gt; different classes play like.  Well I&#39;m also in the navy out here in<br/>\nthe gulf<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;m stationed in Everett, WA.  I haven&#39;t played EQ since March<br/>\n2nd (we<br/>\n&gt; left for westpac March 3rd) and I won&#39;t be able to play until we get<br/>\nback<br/>\n&gt; sometime in middle November.  I have with me here on the ship just about<br/>\n&gt; every EQ book/guide that came out lol from Kunark to Luclin to the<br/>\nEQ Atlas<br/>\n&gt; and the EQ spellbook..I read them whenever I have EQ withdrawls<br/>\n(which is<br/>\n&gt; everyday).  So yeah I just can&#39;t wait to come back to the states and<br/>\nplay<br/>\n&gt; again.  Well I guess I&#39;d better get going for now, take care<br/>\neveryone and<br/>\n&gt; happy hunting!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; /camp </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
