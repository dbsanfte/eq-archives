Cool! ... How much do the satchel s cost? How many slots does it hold? Do you have to buy it more than once? What if you already have 8 containers? Hmm..","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-119383650\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Got on in the bazaar at a good time, with few enough people that the<br/>\n&gt; lag was not terminal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cool!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Buy a trader satchel, load it up. Find a spot on one of the trading<br/>\n&gt; platforms. You cannot trade if you are not on a platform. Type /trade<br/>\n&gt; and set your prices. Hit List Items so others can scan the list. Now<br/>\n&gt; either sit there and chat or afk and do something else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How much do the satchel&#39;s cost? How many slots does it hold? Do you have to<br/>\nbuy it more than once? What if you already have 8 containers?<br/>\nHmm.. Good advice. :-)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I sold for an hour, but no buyers. Then I scanned the shopping list<br/>\n&gt; and found a hq brute hide for 5pp. Seemed a good deal, so I bought<br/>\n&gt; it, banked, and logged.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sweet! I had a lvl 60 offering me like 25 to 30pp per Brute hide I found for<br/>\nhim. :-)<br/>\nSo 5pp is a very good deal.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is a fabulous setup once you get it set up. Find a spot on the<br/>\n&gt; platform and your toon can sell all day while you work or sleep. Just<br/>\n&gt; the thing when you actually want to eat in real life. A real meal, I<br/>\n&gt; mean, not just gamer food.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL. Would help if I could cook I guess. Mom&#39;s out of town so I have been<br/>\neating cold leftovers and junk food. If I wasn&#39;t so lazy I&#39;d actually make<br/>\nsome raman or something.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
