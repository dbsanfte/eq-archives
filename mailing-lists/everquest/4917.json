I was grouped with someone<br/>\nclose enough to the same level as me so I would get xp with him. We went to<br/>\nfight a mob that was dark blue to him. It took us a looong time to kill the<br/>\nmob and when we finally did it, it said that the mob was &quot;trivial&quot; to my<br/>\n&quot;group&quot;. So it didn&#39;t even drop loot. Totally sucked.<br/>\nAlso, there is no &quot;common&quot; language. You start out with your native tongue<br/>\nand people can&#39;t understand you if they speak a different language. There is<br/>\nno /ooc channel. People use auction but auction advertises in your native<br/>\nlanguage. Even tells are sent in your starting language (unless you set it<br/>\nto another language but you pretty much start out at 0 in other languages).<br/>\nYou don&#39;t get any alts on the server either.<br/>\nIt&#39;s kindof cool and there&#39;s some neat stuff. There isn&#39;t much no drop stuff<br/>\non the servers and it can be fun to roleplay.<br/>\nSome author named R.A. Salvatore plays a wizard named Kimmuriel on FV. So I<br/>\nguess he likes it.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
