Like when<br/>\nsomebody says<br/>\n&gt; &quot;WTS a Sword.&quot; and the word Sword is in a different color and when you<br/>\nclick<br/>\n&gt; on it you see the stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, assuming you had an item called &#39;Sword&#39; you would type<br/>\n&quot;WTS a&quot; then press ALT and click on the item in question in your<br/>\ninventory. This brings up a window with the items details. Click on the<br/>\npicture of the item in that window and its item name will be pasted to<br/>\nyour chat cursor as a hotlink.
