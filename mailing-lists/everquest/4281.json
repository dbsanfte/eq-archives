Maybe she honestly <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know that all of the CD keys were different, but it is assumed that <br/>\nshe is trying to scam people out of their accounts. Give her credit! This is <br/>\nwhy I left the group the first time, because people assumed the worst and <br/>\ninstead of explaining things NICELY.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, the CD keys are all different. I don&#39;t know who told you they <br/>\nwere the same or why.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond off, old accounts can NOT be reactivated just like that. EverQuest <br/>\nholds onto your unused and unpaid for accounts for six months before <br/>\ndeleting it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-= Mippon - 40 Halfling Druid =-<br/>\n-= Nevfalath - 8 Dark Elf Necromancer =-<br/>\n-= Areznia - 6 Vah Shir Beastlord =-<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
