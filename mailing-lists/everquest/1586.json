Behind the<br/>\nscenes they do a great job supporting the EQ community<br/>\nas a whole.  The turn over rate for guides, the<br/>\nmainstay of Verant�s CS staff is rather high.  This<br/>\nmakes it difficult to have a smooth flowing CS<br/>\noperation staff on a regular basis.  The rate is high<br/>\ndue to a few reasons:  <br/>\n<br/>\n1. It�s difficult for most to play and be a guide.<br/>\n2. Some can&#39;t handle the workload average 100-200<br/>\npetitions a shift (depending on shift hours, time of<br/>\nday,  etc.).<br/>\n3. Burn out<br/>\n4. Some just get tired of irate players =)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are constantly retraining new support staff and<br/>\nattempt to provide the best possible assistance.   To<br/>\nme it�s amazing at all someone gets a petition<br/>\nanswered.   How many other games out there even<br/>\nattempt to support 200k+ users with direct online<br/>\nface-to-face access to a support staff on a 24hour<br/>\nbasis.   Hehe� Hey if you feel the system has a<br/>\nproblem join the CS staff and try and change the<br/>\nsystem for the better.   I dare ya�<br/>\n<br/>\nJust FYI - To process a surname request:  <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Apprentice/Guide answers a petition and takes down<br/>\nyour information�<br/>\n2. Boots up your petition to a higher level and waits<br/>\nin the queue till a Senior/GM can make the change. <br/>\nGMs work on a 5 day on 2 day off schedule.  Senior<br/>\nGuides are not always available.   They do have SWAT<br/>\nGMs however a surname change would not fall under<br/>\nemergency support.<br/>\n3. Your request also gets posted to a bulletin board<br/>\nafter the Guides shift to be handled as soon as<br/>\npossible.<br/>\n4. Either a Senior Guide fulfilled a request from the<br/>\nBoard or you were lucky enough to have one online the<br/>\nsecond time you petitioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW� Problems like name changes� guides don�t have the<br/>\nability to make the change, so its normal to not have<br/>\nit acted upon immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
