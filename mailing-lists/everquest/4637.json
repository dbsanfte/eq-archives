My pet and I have been killing Greater Scalebones and Greater<br/>\n&gt; Skeletons in Kurn&#39;s Tower. Started there 2 days ago at level 14, and<br/>\n&gt; am now a couple small bubbles from 18. I have been donating for a KEI<br/>\n&gt; buff in PoK before I go there, and in turn have been casting Breeze,<br/>\n&gt; Mist, Strength, Rune I, Quickness, and Intellectual Advancement<br/>\n&gt; spells on other players in Kurn&#39;s to try and help them out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been buffing my pet with Mist, Strength, Quickness, Rune I,<br/>\n&gt; and myself with those buffs plus Intellectual Advancement and<br/>\n&gt; Shielding. I use Root when there is only one target around, and Mez<br/>\n&gt; on a target when there are others in the area. Then I hit them with<br/>\n&gt; Chaotic Feedback and Choke, alternating until the target breaks the<br/>\n&gt; Mez/Root and then my pet finishes it off. I read somewhere that this<br/>\n&gt; is called &quot;Root and Nuke&quot; and that it isn&#39;t very effective. I am<br/>\n&gt; wondering if there are other ways I should be going about trying to<br/>\n&gt; fight as opposed to this? Should I be using my dagger in combination<br/>\n&gt; to the rooting/nuking? Any feedback would be great.
