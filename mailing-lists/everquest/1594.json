Several times I petitioned then waited 3, 4 hours for a response, and nothing. I finally got a guide to help me set the surname (which was rejected with the /surname command) after about 7 petitions. Now, I realize a lowly 20&#39;s surname isn&#39;t the most important petition around, but once a guide got to it, it took, maybe 30 seconds? He ported in to where I was in SK, set it, asked if it was right,&nbsp;I told him yes and thanked him, and he was back to whatever guides and gm&#39;s do. I&#39;m not blaming the poor guide for taking so long to get to it, but surely VI could get a few more ppl, maybe devote some to hacking only,&nbsp;one or two to player assistance like surnames, and weddings, some to item losses due to bugs and maybe corpses in the wall or landscape, some to players cheating/stealing from others. That way hopefully it would all go a bit faster, and those with small things could get them dealt with as quickly as the bigger, more time consuming things like watching train pullers and investigating losses/thefts </font></div> <blockquote style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\"> <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div> <div style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krcarr@...\" title=\"krcarr@...\">Kellee C.</a> </div> <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div> <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Thursday, June 14, 2001 1:19 PM</div> <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> RE: SV: [EverQuest] Verant&#39;s new security policy..</div> <div><br></div><tt>I must say, I think the new policy is rather silly... a true case of<br>throwing the baby out with the bath water (it&#39;s an old saying okay?&nbsp; Seems<br>to fit here)<br><br>Verant must want a lot of people available when Star Wars Galaxies comes<br>online.&nbsp; Or Anarchy online.<br><br>When calculating the cost of their crappy customer service I sure hope<br>they&#39;re not taking into account the fees of the amateur guides who would<br>normally be paying to play EQ.&nbsp; And yes, I consider any company who makes<br>you wait up to three hours just to *answer* a complaint crappy... if you get<br>an answer at all.&nbsp; Apparently /petition requests get purged from the lists<br>if they sit there more than 3 hours.&nbsp; Would you sit on hold on the phone for<br>three hours with or without an 800 line?&nbsp; I sure wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>My guild has people who are also interested in playing other MMORPG&#39;s, some<br>of us are in Beta for Anarchy Online, and believe you me, if enough of us<br>are interested we&#39;ll be porting the guild over to a new game.&nbsp; Why stay with<br>a company who assumes we are guilty or too stupid to own an account?&nbsp; Plus<br>if you share a PC, or are on a home network and are connected to the PC of<br>someone who is NOT computer savvy, you are also vulnerable.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think<br>the average home user should have an MS Certification in Network<br>administration just to play a game.<br><br>Kellee<br>Tunare Server<br>Diela, 26 Bard<br>Diablesse, 14 Enchanter<br>Sanika, 17 Iksar Shaman<br><br>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br>&gt; From: Paul Martin [mailto:pmartin66@...]<br>&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 14, 2001 4:44 PM<br>&gt; To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br>&gt; Subject: Re: SV: [EverQuest] Verant&#39;s new security policy..<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; My question is, why can&#39;t V simply transfer my stuff from my<br>&gt; hacked account<br>&gt; to a new account that I create??
