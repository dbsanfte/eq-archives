I know several guys playing females.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Women generally play female characters, but even here in fantasyland<br/>\n&gt; the are some players and guilds that don&#39;t take a female character<br/>\n&gt; seriously!  The male character seems to get more respect and<br/>\n&gt; leadership positions in these situations.  So some women play male<br/>\n&gt; characters and see a difference in how they are treated by these same<br/>\n&gt; people!  It&#39;s sad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.
