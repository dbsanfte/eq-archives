The original Gold Box version <br>of Everquest was said to have differences from the newer Everquest <br>Classic. I think that the first version was said to have been <br>developed for use directly between two computers in a network or <br>over a phone instead of through a paid game server.<br><br>I have Everquest Trilogy installed plus the Shadows of Luclin <br>expansion pack. I just got into all of this last week. I bought the <br>expansion pack first because I liked the kitties. Then I bought the <br>Everquest Trilogy so that I could use the expansion pack. G. I have <br>no regrets. My only complaint is that I can&#39;t stop playing once I <br>start. I love this game.<br><br>Edward<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com/\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
