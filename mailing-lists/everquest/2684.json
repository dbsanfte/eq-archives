It turns out that the majority of players are male, big <br/>\nsurprise.  And that almost 50% of all female characters are really <br/>\nguys.<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen generally play female characters, but even here in fantasyland <br/>\nthe are some players and guilds that don&#39;t take a female character <br/>\nseriously!  The male character seems to get more respect and <br/>\nleadership positions in these situations.  So some women play male <br/>\ncharacters and see a difference in how they are treated by these same <br/>\npeople!  It&#39;s sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even I have been known to be soft on the ladies.
