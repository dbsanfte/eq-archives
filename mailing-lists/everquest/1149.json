He is<br/>\nsupposedy lvl 16. But that is total BS. He cons green to a level 20. He<br/>\nwaaaaaaay undercons. You need like a lvl 40 druid or something to snare the<br/>\nbastard bc he resists root to lvl 20s. Sometimes he resists root from higher<br/>\nlvls too. Or it will say he&#39;s rooted and he&#39;ll still be moving. This bastard<br/>\nhits hard too. I logged in to EQ one time and before I had fully logged he<br/>\nwas already attacking me. At lvl 20 I hit him once. He hit me 20 times in a<br/>\nrow. I was dead in about 30 seconds. I&#39;m willing to bet he&#39;s actually the<br/>\nsame lvl as Dvinn.<br/>\nOh, and over lvl 20, Highkeep is a great place to hunt.
