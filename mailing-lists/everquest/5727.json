My guess is that my spam filter<br/>\n&gt; ate them before I ever knew I had them.  Oh well! :(<br/>\n&gt;  So I&#39;d like to know if this is possible as well. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sweating it though cause I dont really have<br/>\n&gt; any friends whom I would give the keys to, they&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; just go to waste.  However, I do have the EverQuest<br/>\n&gt; Evolutions pack unopened.  I was goign to set up a<br/>\n&gt; 3rd account once I got another computer powerful<br/>\n&gt; enough to run it.  But I may end up selling it to<br/>\n&gt; someone or giving it away as a gift if I come across<br/>\n&gt; anyone who might want to start playing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Melanie Johnson <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, June 21, 2004 12:34 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Someone take me under<br/>\n&gt; their wing!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I was wondering if anyone knows if there is a way<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;   request one of these keys?

I recently<br/>\n&gt;   re-subscribed at the first of June, so I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; sure<br/>\n&gt;   when these keys came out.
