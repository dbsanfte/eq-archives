Forage<br/>\ncinammon sticks and you can sell them to other players. I had a player pay<br/>\nme 20pp per stick! So for 2 stacks I had 800pp.<br/>\nAlso, you can go specific places to forage specific things. Kithkoor has the<br/>\nhard to find oak bark. If you fee like it sometime, sit just inside the zone<br/>\nto kith (in case you need to run if undead come) and forage til you get<br/>\nsome. It may be time consuming but the payoff is worth it when you can sell<br/>\nit. Morning dew is also in high demand. You can also sell foraged vegetables<br/>\nto non-foraging races for baking. Baking may be worth your while. You can<br/>\nalso work on brewery using vegetables. Once you are good at it you can make<br/>\nheady kiola to sell to tailors for raw silk. You can also offer to track<br/>\nthings for a fee.<br/>\nAt your level foraging in gfay is your best bet.<br/>\nAlso kill as many pixie tricksters as you can. their wings sell to venders<br/>\nfor a decent price.<br/>\nOh, and I played on test server the other day and they have all sorts of new<br/>\ncreatures in gfay. drakelings, evil treants, etc. If and when they become<br/>\npart of regular servers you may be asked to track specific mobs like<br/>\ndecaying skeletons (which were in short supply).<br/>\nMost importantly, be friendly. I have found that being nice to people has<br/>\nbeen profitable. People gave me money just for showing them where places<br/>\nwere.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Does anyone know a good way to make money in Everquest.  You find<br/>\n&gt; these websites with these huge secrets to making plat. but who<br/>\n&gt; knows.  I just started, and didn&#39;t know this game could be so<br/>\n&gt; addictive.  I am a wood elf ranger.  I boosted all my bonus points<br/>\n&gt; to str at 90.  So its not so bad.  Im only level 3 though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
