In my previous EQ days ( I quit right after PoP came <br/>\nout) I played strictly melee characters....had a 57th lvl Barb <br/>\nWarrior, and a 59th lvl Hum Monk. I got tired of the endless <br/>\nsearching for groups, and the seeming HUGE overload of really well <br/>\nequipped melees on my server (Tunare) so this time around I decided <br/>\nto go with a high demand class, and finally, after much <br/>\nconsideration, I decided to play the class I most loved duoing with <br/>\nas a monk, the Shaman. I rolled up a Barb Shaman with my new EQ <br/>\nEvolutions software, and -pop- there I was, back in Halas again after <br/>\nnearly a yeas absence. A lot of things came back to me, and within a <br/>\ncouple of hours, I hit lvl 5, got my new spells, and then I hit a <br/>\nbrick wall. Non of my old friends seem to be around anymore, so I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have them to ask for advice, so I turned to this group for <br/>\nhelp. I have been told Steamfront is the best place to go to lvl up a <br/>\nshammy for the next few cycles anyway...any thoughts on this? I am <br/>\nnot looking to necessarily powerlevel, though I do miss the high end <br/>\nraiding, pulling in Kael , the 12 hour raids in HoT in ToV, etc and <br/>\nwould like to get back to those, but I am willing to put in the time <br/>\nto learn this classes ins and outs, and make myself an integral part <br/>\nof any group I join. So any help with where to level, etc would be <br/>\ngreat, since it has been since early 2001 that I was a newbie the <br/>\nfirst time.........and the old haunts seem to be deserted now. I do <br/>\nlike the new transport systems, made getting out of Halas much easier <br/>\nthan it was with my warrior ( the run to Freeport with a lvl 5 <br/>\nnightblind warrior in cloth armor was harrowing lol) ...also if <br/>\nanyone has a main or an alt on Tunare that would like to group with a <br/>\nn00b shammy and help him get the hang of it all, send a tell to <br/>\nKarudore  ..... see you all soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarudore - lvl 5 Barb n00b shammy, Tunare<br/>\nR.I.P.<br/>\nKarudor (warrior)<br/>\nKerudor (monk)<br/>\nI miss you guys !!!!!!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
