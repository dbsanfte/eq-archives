Multiperson adentures had better loot than single person <br/>\nadventures. You would grab a random person of the right level, get an <br/>\nadventure with them and then they would leave the group (and go do <br/>\nwhatever). You could then solo the team adventure.... Btw, IMHO, EQ <br/>\ncould have taken some tips from AO on the mission/adventure structure. <br/>\nSo, hang-out at the camps, grap 2 peeps (min is 3now right?) get the adv <br/>\nand they disband.<br/>\n<br/>\nCiao,<br/>\nMiracht Riversfriend,<br/>\n51 Shaman, The Nameless<br/>\nChampions of Cabilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 4<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 13:18:22 -0500<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Wulfric Rennison&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Digest Number 975<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The difference is that you started with a full group and had already requested an adventure before you entered the zone.  The game accounts for things such as death and LinkDeath.  As long as the group stays at least 2 people intact  AFTER the adventure is requested you can still enter the zone.  However, you cannot request an adventure by yourself or enter a zone without having requested an adventure.  You will simply get a message staing perhaps you should try finding other adventurers like yourself.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;...<br/>\n&gt;Raido Covenfall<br/>\n&gt;55 ELF DRU<br/>\n&gt;Cazic Thule Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
