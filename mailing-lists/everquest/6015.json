I don&#39;t know why, I guess his dps wasn&#39;t that good. The shaman was ready to leave bc he kept getting aggro and the tank had a hard time taunting off of him for some reason. So I decided to protect the shammy and as soon as the shammy slowed I would stun the mob and run up within melee range and start bashing the hell out of it. I was actually better at getting aggro than the tank. lol. I&#39;ve had to do that for chanters too. So long as I can take the hits it&#39;s ok.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======== At 2004-12-20, 14:00:00 you wrote: ========<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta agree with ya there Su.  With my lvl 67 Shammy i find that my slows tend to pull agro away from the tank and  i have to automatically start melee as soon as the mob gets close to me  until the Tank can steal agro back until i cast my DoT on em and regain agro again lol.  I have learned as well to not run away either cause that brief moment when you turn away could get ya killed a lot faster  if you don&#39;t just stand there melee back and hope yer healer (druid/Shaman/ Cleric/ or even Ranger) can get a heal off on ya before too long.  Prim example was last night in Harbingers and I wound up getting the agro form a Named and wound up melee cause we had a crap load of ads and even with my AoE slow i still managed to not only get the named but the adds at the same time .  Luckily I had my Shammy 1.5 in hand and clicked it to help keep me alive till The cleric could get a heal off on me and the rest of the melee could draw the adds and such away form this almost dead shimmy =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHalyburton (the Recently Sol Ro flagged)<br/>\n67 Barb Shammy<br/>\n1.0/1.5 Enabled<br/>\nLegion of Vengeance<br/>\nSaryrn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Su <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Sunday, December 19, 2004 5:57 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: [EverQuest] ok here we go agian...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue. I had people laughing at me when I was in my 40s and 50s level range because I wanted to melee a bit and let the mobs try to hit me to make my defense go up. They said I would never need defense and I didn&#39;t need to worry about it. However, being able to dodge hits can really come in handy and sometimes I have had to melee mobs to death when oom and having to kill a mob that is running away. A single bash can be the difference between killing a mob and getting a ton of adds.<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======== At 2004-12-18, 11:03:00 you wrote: ========<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills, skills, skills, skills, skills, skills, skills!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate to be the one to say this but you really should focus on your <br/>\nbattle skills. Trust me, at the lower levels that is a perfect time to <br/>\nget the skills built up. I can understand wanting to go in and just beat <br/>\nthe heck out of everything and being uber and killing it all in one <br/>\nshot. But ponder this, When you get to be up in levels (50&#39;s, 60&#39;s, and <br/>\n70&#39;s) you are going to be taking on some majorly nasty monsters. If you <br/>\nhave just gained levels and have an uber weapon but never really worked <br/>\non your fighting skills and they are low, it&#39;s not going to help you or <br/>\nyour party out very much. Actually you will hurt your group more than <br/>\nhelp them. Now being a Shammy you have some awesome spells at higher <br/>\nlevels. This is another thing I would suggest focusing on. If your at a <br/>\nhigher level and your fighting say a dragon and 60% of your casts fizz <br/>\nthen you may as well run or be able to hit! (See first part) otherwise <br/>\nyour gonna get killed or your group killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
