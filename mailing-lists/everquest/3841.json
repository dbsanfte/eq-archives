If you are totally<br/>\n&gt; new and don&#39;t know much about EQ NOR have a high level<br/>\n&gt; alt, I would Really have to say to put the extra in<br/>\n&gt; Str.  The reason is because Chainmail is still heavy<br/>\n&gt; and when have a full suit of Mail you will have about<br/>\n&gt; 10-20 pts of weight to allow for loot.  This is not<br/>\n&gt; much at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I spent most of my pre-40 levels overweight and it&#39;s <br/>\nreally not all that big of a deal.  And by the time that <br/>\nyou are able to get all of the components to finish the <br/>\nnewbie armor quests, you should have either enough cash <br/>\nor the components to have someone make you weight <br/>\nreduction bags or will have quested one or 2 on your <br/>\nown).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; NOW, if you have an alt and are twinked, we all know<br/>\n&gt; what this means, then I can see why to put in Stamina.<br/>\n&gt; Since most will have a full suit of Ivory etched<br/>\n&gt; armow which does not weight all that much as compared<br/>\n&gt; to Chain.  Plus twinks will tend to CHAIN pull, like<br/>\n&gt; the example we saw in the keep.  Meaning, pulling so<br/>\n&gt; much or the ranger being the main tank that you need<br/>\n&gt; to worry about Stamina.  If you have one or two<br/>\n&gt; warriors, a ranger should not worry about STA since<br/>\n&gt; his/her role is to assist and draw aggro if tank gets<br/>\n&gt; hurt to bad. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rangers SHOULD worry about STA, whether you are twinked <br/>\nor now, especially if you are using heavy weapons.  Pre <br/>\n100 STA, your stamina bar does mean something......post <br/>\n100, it really means nothing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs well, STA = HP.  After AC, HP&#39;s are king (and since <br/>\nthere is a soft AC cap, once you get to the highest <br/>\nlevels, HP and STA gear gains far more importance than <br/>\nAC).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Summary:  For a totally new player I still suggest STR<br/>\n&gt; and rely on others to assist in your flaws, like the<br/>\n&gt; druid partner.  If you have alts and good weaps, then<br/>\n&gt; yes maybe STA is the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>STR items are very easily obtained.  It&#39;s really not <br/>\nworth it to put that many points into STR.  Even new <br/>\nplayers can get their STR up to decent levels easy <br/>\nenough to make it without having to put any points in <br/>\nSTR.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I knew what I know now when I created my Ranger <br/>\nalmost 2 years ago, there is no quetion I would have put <br/>\nall of my points into STA (I did put a few in).  It&#39;s <br/>\ntook me 50+ levels to get my STA up to acceptable <br/>\nlevels, while STR wasn&#39;t all that much of a problem, <br/>\nespecially since you get STR spells eventually anyway.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
