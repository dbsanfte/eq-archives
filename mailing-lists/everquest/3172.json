First of all, THANK YOU for all of your <br/>\nreplies!<br/>\nWell, here&#39;s the fix: <br/>\nI knew that you spoke truth when you mentioned the background <br/>\nprocesses.  but when I went to msconfig and unchecked everything- no <br/>\nhelp. although avail went up to 93megs (from 20). <br/>\nI then tried checking diagnostic startup, it&#39;s the option that says <br/>\nthat it omly loads essential stuff...DO NOT DO THIS IN XP!!!<br/>\nthe probem is that one of the programs that gets unchecked has to do <br/>\nwith activation confirmation, so when I rebooted- it said that it <br/>\nwas unable to be confirmed. I had to call the 888 number and go all <br/>\nthrough activation again because the internet connection was also <br/>\nshut down.<br/>\nhere&#39;s what I turned off:<br/>\ndeactivated everything in startup (in msconfig)<br/>\nunceckecked the following in services:<br/>\nclipbook<br/>\ncd burning<br/>\nmessenger<br/>\nremovable storage<br/>\nremote desktop help<br/>\ntrue vector (for zonealarm)<br/>\nuninteruptable p.s.<br/>\nM$ firewall utility<br/>\nI did this and couldn&#39;t get a connection, then I started up <br/>\nzonealarm and voila!

You might not want to put a housefan that close to your <br/>\ncomputer. Fans<br/>\n&gt; that size have an electromagnetic field that can cause problems. <br/>\nSome fans<br/>\n&gt; can disrupt monitors if too close. It can even erase or corrupt <br/>\ndata on your<br/>\n&gt; harddrive. It&#39;s best to use a device specifically designed for use <br/>\nwith a<br/>\n&gt; computer rather than something like that.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Amy Williams&quot; &lt;amy_e_williams@h...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
