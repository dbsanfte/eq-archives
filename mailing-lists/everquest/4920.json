I agree. I never did research with my wizard bc I started it and it was a royal pain so I gave up.

It amounts to no more than going<br/>\n&gt; to hundreds of vendors, over and over again to find a page, or words<br/>\n&gt; or rune, buy it and then have it fail when you try to make the<br/>\n&gt; spell.  The idea is to have you kill mobs for it.....but the mobs<br/>\n&gt; are allways higher level, and rarely drop it when you want it.  By<br/>\n&gt; the time you get the pages or runes you need for your 16th level<br/>\n&gt; spell......you&#39;re 32nd level.  So you have to buy them, at inflated<br/>\n&gt; prices, and thats IF you can find them.  Then after going thru all<br/>\n&gt; that....poof...it fails, and you have to start all over again.  A<br/>\n&gt; stupid idea.  Why not have the spells drop off certin mobs like a<br/>\n&gt; quest, so then peeps will camp them, oh my, don&#39;t have a good<br/>\n&gt; soultion, but current one is not fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree. I never did research with my wizard bc I started it and it was a<br/>\nroyal pain so I gave up. Maybe they could do it much like ethereal<br/>\nparchments where you get a specific type of item and turn it in to an npc<br/>\nfor faction, xp, and either a spell or a particular page or something for<br/>\nthe research. Maybe you can say what page you need-- like when you tell the<br/>\nguy near the muffin eating dwarf in Freeport that you want the wood bits or<br/>\nsomething like that as part of the quest for the trueshot bow. Or maybe they<br/>\nshould have vendors that only buy things like pages and research items (like<br/>\nthe merchants in Morrowind that only buy certain types of items). What do<br/>\nyou think?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
