First of all anyone who plays<br/>\n </span></blockquote>alot of games on a computer will notice most games come with a &gt;cd-key  and<br/>\nthey codes are all different.  Second of all how can you lose a jewel case<br/>\nbut not the cd that came in it?  I have used many cd &gt;games and have not<br/>\nonce lost the cd key for the game and I keep a record of my cd keys in case<br/>\nthe key becomes faded to the point i can &gt;now longer read it.  i.e: my<br/>\ndiabvlo 2 cd key the key is so faded i no longer can read it.  Well that<br/>\njust my 2 cents.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, lets just assume the person is new to computer games or thought this<br/>\none worked differently.<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to lose the case if you keep the CD out to put in the computer or<br/>\nyou put it in a different place. I often lose my CD cases without losing the<br/>\nCDs. and I often lose CDs but still find the cases.. Or I lose both<br/>\naltogether. Some of us are just not that organized.<br/>\nGive people the benefit of the doubt.<br/>\nGo play and have fun. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
