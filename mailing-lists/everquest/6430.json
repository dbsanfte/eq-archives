Secondary is around 80Gb). Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card (has always worked fine for me with no conflicts) and GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128mb video card (that was also an upgrade I added). The northbridge on the chipset with my ASUS A7M266-M motherboard is notorious for corrupting memory on computers. HP really sold me a lemon. The DVD drive, floppy drive, and a few of the USB ports are defective. The best thing about the PC is that I got a large tower that is easy to open up.<br/>\nI just dumped the 250W power supply that came with it and replaced it with a Antec SmartPower 2.0 450W power supply (got it on ebay for less than $50 and it runs quieter than the crappy one HP put in).<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to get the ASUS A8V Deluxe motherboard, AMD Athlon 64 3200+ 2.0GHz processor with Venice core, and 1Gb of Kingston DDR400 (PC3200) RAM. Newegg has the motherboard refurbished for under $100 but I don&#39;t know if I should buy refurbished... Money is an issue and the computers with all of the specs I want are well over $500. I don&#39;t want to buy from Dell bc I&#39;ve dealt with their customer &quot;service&quot; before. Don&#39;t want to buy from HP again bc they sell lemons (and they claim that you will never need higher than 300w power supply-- which is why a pc my father custom ordered would not work bc the power supply was insufficient).<br/>\n<br/>\nIts not so much that my PC sucks but that my ISP is not ideal for online gaming. I have satellite since my phonelines were too horrible to even get dialup anymore (they spliced them up so bad that I could not even connect when attempting to dial in). The download is good most of the time but the upload is worse than dialup. On warcraft I&#39;m constantly above 1200ms latency. Believe it or not, warcraft is actually playable with that and loads much faster than EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nMan..
