For the first ten levels<br/>\nor so it doesn&#39;t really matter where you start, GFay<br/>\nis fine, most of my characters grew up there. There&#39;s<br/>\na lot of idiots to deal with, but it&#39;s good practice<br/>\nfor zones like LOIO and Unrest later. ;) Aside from<br/>\nthat i&#39;ve grown to quite like the Commonlands.<br/>\nCatching a TP to WC and running to Freeport is pretty<br/>\neasily done, in EC/WC you&#39;ll be hunting bears and<br/>\nspiders. Both of which drop tailoring components that<br/>\nsell relatively well. (Hiqh Quality Bear Skins sell<br/>\nfor 30pp, and stacks of 20 Spider Silks about 15pp)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;yadda....See the problem with my boyfriend being<br/>\n&gt;experienced in the game is that he did it ALL for<br/>\n&gt;me, or led me around by the collar doing it all for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>me<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the basics for you. For the first few levels,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll mostly just run around and whack bugs with a<br/>\nclub. Try to raise your One Hand Blunt and One Hand<br/>\nSlashing skills (using scimitars for the latter). It&#39;s<br/>\na very long term consideration, but if you ever do<br/>\nreach lvl 50+, you&#39;ll want to quest for your Epic, a<br/>\nscimitar.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you start getting a little more mana to work with<br/>\nand a few more spells, you can start practicing a<br/>\ntechnique called Kiting. (you can start doing it<br/>\nreally effectively as soon as you can cast Spirit of<br/>\nthe Wolf) Kiting is casting Snare on a single monster,<br/>\nhaving SoW on yourself already, then running away a<br/>\ndistance, cast a DD spell, run a little more, cast a<br/>\nspell, repeat until the monster is dead. Ideally you<br/>\nwant to keep the MOB at the very edge of your casting<br/>\nrange, at very least far enough that they can&#39;t hit<br/>\nyou. Using that technique you can kill yellows and<br/>\neven in some cases monsters that barely con red. (do<br/>\nyour research on eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com before you<br/>\neven DREAM of attacking a red conning monster)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; :-P...i want to do this on my own and have no idea<br/>\n&gt; where to start...Do i just jump out there and start<br/>\n&gt; killing critters or run around and hope i can find<br/>\n&gt; my way back from wherever i leave??  i know i sound<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very early on (lvl 4 if memory serves) you get a spell<br/>\ncalled Gate. Once you have that, you can always<br/>\nteleport back to where you&#39;re bound. (the spot where<br/>\nyou go to when you die) If you&#39;re a Wood Elf, that<br/>\nwill be near Newbie Lift in Kelethin, if you travel to<br/>\nFreeport try to get a bind near the Eastern Gate.<br/>\n(pretty common request) Once you get your next round<br/>\nof spells (again memory is foggy but I believe level<br/>\n9) you get a spell called Bind Affinity, which allows<br/>\nyou to change your bind point to wherever you&#39;re<br/>\nstanding. It&#39;s your best friend to keep from getting<br/>\nlost, you can just wander at random and gate back to<br/>\nsafety whenever you need. Plus Gate is your panic<br/>\nbutton, when you see MOBs you can&#39;t handle, you can<br/>\nalways run away a bit and gate. (preferably with snare<br/>\non them and SoW on you to buy a bit more time)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; foolish but it is really important to do this on my<br/>\n&gt; own..how else can one really learn??  Help is great<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Read. Constantly. Try these sites:<br/>\n<br/>\nallakhazam.com<br/>\neqvault.ign.com<br/>\neq.castersrealm.com<br/>\neqatlas.com<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of other sites, those are the best<br/>\nones i&#39;ve come across though. (thesafehouse.org is<br/>\namazing for rogues, but not a lot of general<br/>\ninformation there)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to travel to a new zone, do a little<br/>\nresearch. EQ Atlas is great for that, you can get a<br/>\nmap of any zone in the game, and there&#39;s a link to<br/>\nallakhazam.com&#39;s beastiary, so you can find out what<br/>\nmobs you will find there and what to avoid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and i really do appreciate it but i also want to<br/>\n&gt;feel like i have accomplished something<br/>\n&gt;personally...Does that make sense...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Totally, got several friends who were in similar<br/>\npositions. I just hope your BF isn&#39;t the controlling<br/>\ntype. :/ Seen a few nasty situations where BF&#39;s start<br/>\ngetting jealous of their GF&#39;s achievements...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nFind, Connect, Date! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://personals.yahoo.ca\">http://personals.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
