NO. Just play the game as its meant, if you<br/>\n&gt; do it any other way...why its just a glorified irc chat room.  You<br/>\n&gt; still cant fight anything beyond your level, you just stand out<br/>\n&gt; someone whos trying to bypass the system, and most people will look<br/>\n&gt; down on you as someone who cant handle the game.  Nothing personal i<br/>\n&gt; just put all twinkies in the same catogery.  The game is just not that<br/>\n&gt; hard, but as in real life everyone is looking for a handout.

I currently have only<br/>\n&gt;      one persona in EQ...a cleric who is almost level 40 now.<br/>\n&gt;      She acquired her exp and items the hard way...fighting and<br/>\n&gt;      dying for them, saving enough plat to buy them, camping for<br/>\n&gt;      hours and days on end for them, and trading some of them for<br/>\n&gt;      others.  I have all my banded from my early days and some<br/>\n&gt;      other nice things vaulted...I did not sell them.  Why?<br/>\n&gt;      Because when my current persona DOES get a sibling, you can<br/>\n&gt;      bet that is whom they are going to go to. A Twinkie? Yah,<br/>\n&gt;      you betcha.  But don&#39;t forget....they were originally gotten<br/>\n&gt;      the long, hard way. Been there...done that....not gonna do<br/>\n&gt;      it again.

Why to people just give<br/>\n&gt;           things away to people. Let them work for it, or at<br/>\n&gt;           least pay for it.  Especially when the person<br/>\n&gt;           receiving it has no idea where it came from.  Its<br/>\n&gt;           funny and sad really, when your in the newbie yard<br/>\n&gt;           and you see a level 2 player chasing a snake<br/>\n&gt;           around in full bronze armor.  The Crude Stein is<br/>\n&gt;           no big deal, but if someone wants to give you<br/>\n&gt;           something that is significant don&#39;t accept it.<br/>\n&gt;           Add a little character to your character, so to<br/>\n&gt;           speak. Get down in the trenches with the rest of<br/>\n&gt;           us, in the long run it will make you a better<br/>\n&gt;           player.  Some call it twinking, I call them<br/>\n&gt;           Twinkies..  looks good yet not much substance. :)<br/>\n&gt;           hehe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;           Anyways...   have fun... hehe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;           Duhase - Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;           -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;           From: kale usi [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;           Sent: Saturday, June 12, 1999 10:34 AM<br/>\n&gt;           To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>;<br/>\n&gt;           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Neriak@onelist.com\">EQ_Neriak@onelist.com</a>;<br/>\n&gt;           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Potters@onelist.com\">EQ_Potters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;           Subject: [EverQuest] Looking for item<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;           From: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;           Will pay good PP for a Crude Stein or the<br/>\n&gt;           information leading to me<br/>\n&gt;           obtaining one (on Bertoxx server).
