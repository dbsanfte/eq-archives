Let s kick it s ass. Now if you are not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-211387422\">Su,<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually use an assist macro:<br/>\n<br/>\n/target &lt;puller/maintank name&gt;<br/>\n/pause 4<br/>\n/g Assisting %t<br/>\n/assist<br/>\n/g Attacking %t.  Let&#39;s kick it&#39;s ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you are not using assist with auto attack, you can either put in /attack into one of the lines in the macro or simply do hit the &quot;g&quot; key(my attack key) after the macro goes off and you have the mob targeted.  You can change the last /g message to whatever you like(Don&#39;t run! We are your friends or whatever).  Also, since I am in so many pickup groups in DL, my first line gets edited for each group I join with the name of the main puller/tank - you could target your puller and not have this line, but I find it easier for me.  The /pause is to allow things to process - for my normal lag and such, it is needed - not everyone has to have a /pause.  Btw, you can include a pause combined with another command on the same line:<br/>\n<br/>\n/pause 4, /target &lt;name&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pause occurs after the targeting.  Don&#39;t ask why, just the way it works.  I separted the two since I change my /target line a lot - I am lazy about certain things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger<br/>\nRobiinton Masterhealer<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 2<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 9 May 2001 03:43:31 +1000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Use macros to communicate(was About loot order)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWow! Thank you so much! I had no idea how to setup the macros. i was<br/>\nwondering how people did it! This will help me alot!<br/>\nHow do I set up an attack macro that says something everytime I start to<br/>\nattack? Like if I want to say &quot;Don&#39;t run!
