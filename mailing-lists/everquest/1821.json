I understand how","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-823408722\">Mmm... it&#39;s true that the peopel who are getting PLed are not doing <br/>\nmuch work.  They level faster than people who actually level <br/>\nthemselves.  I understand how you would think this is not really fair <br/>\nbut sometimes people like to help others.  When I help people, I PL <br/>\nthem.  I won&#39;t help them get equipment because that&#39;s what you need <br/>\nto do for yourself since it generally makes you more powerful <br/>\nespecially magical items.  AND when I PL them, I don&#39;t take over <br/>\ncamps to help them level.  I just look around for roaming mobs that <br/>\nare not a RARE of course and let them kill it.  Heal them when <br/>\nnecessary.  The usual method.  I don&#39;t steal camps from people or <br/>\ncamp things when tyring to PL &#39;em.  I know that&#39;s wrong cuz if I did <br/>\nthat I would feel like I&#39;m hogging the camp since I wouldn&#39;t get xp <br/>\nin the first place and it&#39;s a camp that everyone wants to have.  For <br/>\nexample, PLing in cb.  I just look for any orcs i see and let them <br/>\nkill it.  There are hardly any camps in there.  The only camps there <br/>\nare in cb are in the castle itself and near the tents.  Anyway, my <br/>\npoint is, is that I find it wrong when people take over camps to PL <br/>\nbut I find it ok when people just kill roaming mobs to PL.  AND yeah, <br/>\nI don&#39;t like when peopel twink.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t give peopel <br/>\nequipment or money.  Maybe leather armor but that&#39;s about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Dan&quot; &lt;danspth@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Opinions vary. I personally find the whole power leveling idea to <br/>\nbe most<br/>\n&gt; dishonorable. To see an orc camp taken over by a 50+ druid and a lv <br/>\n6 ogre<br/>\n&gt; warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer reminds me how people are <br/>\nhave no<br/>\n&gt; willingness to work for things (the whole cheat code thing). But <br/>\nmany people<br/>\n&gt; find it ok to twink/power level and, well, so be it. I can see it, <br/>\nshiver,<br/>\n&gt; and keep moving. Live and let live. I am fortunate that at lv 43 I <br/>\ncan solo<br/>\n&gt; and this is only an inconvience at worse to me instead of a real <br/>\nissue. But<br/>\n&gt; up until lv 35 I was still having camps stolen from me by uber <br/>\ntwinks and<br/>\n&gt; anon druids.<br/>\n&gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Thomas H.
