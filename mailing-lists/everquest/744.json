I have played many other classes, some over 20, but not<br/>\nmany.  The paladin and ranger classes cannot be compared unless our spells are<br/>\nleft out.  When dueling, paladins have a small advantage.  When melee&#39;ing<br/>\ncreatures, Rangers can come into the lead, dmg-wise.  I believe that Rangers<br/>\ncannot truly see how powerful they will be until level 30, when a glimpse can be<br/>\ncaught, then at 39 when we get our true spells that we needed at level 30.  I<br/>\nthink that from level 20 to 30 is when most people will quit EQ or their<br/>\ncharacter because they think another class is more attractive, and it may be..<br/>\nit depends upon the person to truly master the character.  I can kill a level 50<br/>\nWizard in a duel.  If he got one Ice Comet off and a couple hits with his stick,<br/>\nI would be in the most trouble.  We cannot be compared.  All classes must work<br/>\ntogether for a greater good.  I don&#39;t want to compare my 41 Ranger to a 41<br/>\nPaladin.  I have great fun fighting with friends and helping them out with<br/>\nthings.  Don&#39;t complain about armor, weapons, spells, etc, because we are not<br/>\nsupposed to be gods at level 20, or 25, or 30, and we aren&#39;t supposed to be gods<br/>\nat 50, or 75.  In a group, anything can be done.  No class can stand by itself.<br/>\nIt has been tried, and everyone who has tried failed, unless in some occasion<br/>\nwhere 25 lvl 50 wizards got off ice comet at the same time at Vox or some other<br/>\nbeast.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock on with a character if you like that character, and dont ever delete your<br/>\ncharacter if you want to start a new one, because you will regret it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you play on the Bertoxxulous server, you may know me and the Guardians of<br/>\nTunare, and if you want to see the power that a ranger or any other class for<br/>\nthat matter has, give me a tell.  I have friends, and we will gladly help you<br/>\nsee why you must stick with your character to the end, whenever that may be,<br/>\nafter 500+ hours of playtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlexar Arkturis<br/>\n41st Ranger, Bertoxxulous server<br/>\nGuildmaster, Guardians of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Whitmore, Lance&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Whitmore, Lance&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lwhitmore@...\">lwhitmore@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I enjoy my Ranger character..

When have the Rangers truly ever been upgrade?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     1.  Given &quot;Dances with Fire Flies spell&quot;  -  wow that&#39;s a winner<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     2.  Given Critical Hits with bows  -  that&#39;s a no brainer - even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; though warriors cover all weapons<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     3.  Given Slightly Higher Caps on certain combat skills - making them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at least similar, but lower, to the other combat classes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     4.  Given +4 SV against fire and cold - does this really matter,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seriously =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s it..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Sure I have track, but so do druids and bards.  Problem is, when all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the quests and locations for MOBs are published on the internet, who needs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that skill anymore.  I remember Brad saying that he wanted to make Rangers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the masters of duel wield... well how bout increasing our percentages for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oh well...   =) Lance<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       After the recent upgrade to the Ranger, Paladins were certain that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they were<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       next for enhancement. We waited patiently for the patch that was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supposed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       be our salvation. Instead, what we received was armor quests that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were 10<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       times the length and 5 times more costly than any of the quest of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any other<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       class. And for all of that the armor stinks. Class specific plate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; armor for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       the Paladin has less AC than that of the chain worn by the ranger.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Paladins<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       are the &quot;Holy Knight&quot; counterpart to the ranger. Yet, with the last<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       patches, the Ranger has been augmented so that he has more AC even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; though he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       can wear no platemail. He also has higher skill caps, does nearly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; twice the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       damage in battle, has spell equivalents to most of the Paladins<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells yet<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       not confined to undead. Ensnare is far more effective that root.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Several<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       other spells and buffs of the druid class aren&#39;t nerfed , level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wise, as with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       the paladin. The ranger can track. Whereas the paladin can point<br/>\n&gt; &gt; himself in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       the direction of the nearest undead, unless of course if there is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pet in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       the area.
