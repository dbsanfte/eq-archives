Once was <br/>\nfrom a Cleric who was PL&#39;ing an Ogre War who sat down in the exit <br/>\nfrom SolA, so nobody got out of there alive.  She Rezzed everyone and <br/>\nstarted smacking him good! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nDeath is just a part of the game.  Yeah, it sucks to die, especially <br/>\ndeep in a dungone or in the middle of the zone.  Luckily I can SoW, <br/>\nbuff myself to the max and RUN like mad.  It helps to know where you <br/>\nare when you go down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think all Buffs, Rezzes, SoW and all of that are bestowed upon <br/>\npeople as a favor, not as a requirement just because you can.  I <br/>\nget &quot;Demands&quot; for Sow and anything else.  A lot of people get ignored.<br/>\nAnd I always make sure to have a few plat on me, for a port, a <br/>\nclarity or a rez.  It&#39;s only right to at least offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nTul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Oh, I know that feeling. I get sooo many rez requests for my <br/>\ncleric. I mean,<br/>\n&gt; I will get people who contact me when I am in GD and want me to rez <br/>\nthem in<br/>\n&gt; Guk. And I&quot;m not even talking about guildies.. My guildies are <br/>\nfairly nice<br/>\n&gt; about that. There have been maybe 2 people in guild (not counting <br/>\nthe ones<br/>\n&gt; related to me by blood) who annoyed me by wanting me to drop <br/>\neverything to<br/>\n&gt; go either rez or powerlevel them. The rezzing doesn&#39;t bother me. I <br/>\ndid over<br/>\n&gt; 33 rezzes in 2 days. I received donations for 2 of them. But I felt <br/>\ngood<br/>\n&gt; having helped people. I generally only ask for a rez if I can&#39;t get <br/>\nback to<br/>\n&gt; my own corpse to rez it-- or if I&#39;m playing my bard or wizard.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In regards to death in game and such.  There was a time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when our highest level Cleric at the time was so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inundated with requests from  guildies to rez them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everytime they died.  It didn&#39;t matter that  there was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric in the zone that was happy to do the rez, for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; small donation in most cases.  But the people that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either had not been smart enough to carry enough pp on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them or were just too cheap to donate for the rez were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mostly the ones to beg our cleric to rezz them.  Now our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric soon realized the pattern only after I had the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gumption to mention it to him after I got a rezz from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him, luckily he was only one zone over from where I had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; died and he was getting ready to log for the night so I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; managed to catch him when he wasn&#39;t busy.  Once I showed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him the pattern he learned to not drop everything he was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing to rezz the poor soul and also checked to see if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there was a cleric nearby before he even went to rezz<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the peep.  Unfortunately he got  one request too many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when he was working on his Epic and he got fed up and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; left guild.  But the few of us who didn&#39;t bother him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; constantly if he was not busy he will still do teh rez<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for  us IF and only If we were not able to find one on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our own.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But the rezzes really are  more of a priviledge than a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right in the game. At least that is the way I see it.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pretty much solo a lot onmy own atm when i am really not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wanting to hurry up and level.  this helps me learn the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zone I am in a little better and  I rarely ask for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rezz unless I have lost a level or I am very close to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ding.  And if I must go to the guild for a rezz i make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sure I have exhausted all the other avenues before going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to teh guild to see if any of our rezzers are on.  Hell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve even settled for a 35% on more occasion than I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; count  if that was the best i could get and was quite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happy with it. And i always make sure that I offer a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; donation whether I have said I would donate or not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Most times when I do get teh rezz I have had the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; donation rejected only because I made the effort to fork<br/>\n&gt; &gt; over the pp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cynfyn MacCulloch 51 DESK<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Halyburton Bearhugger 26 BarbShm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Saltaque 12 HIEEnch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Qapmoc 11 HalfElf Ranger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oroblram 9 Hu War<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Doktari 6 HIE Cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Defender of the Faith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Saryn </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
