Also we may want to work on the orc Trainer. He drops occasionally a shield that has something like, (These are rough guess&#39;), AC10 and +10 resistance to magic and such.

I decided to forego the leggings and tunic for the quest armor.  I<br/>\n&gt; was given a dwarven ringmail tunic which works just as well.  I figured I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; go back to EC and try to gain a few levels, then if I haven&#39;t gotten<br/>\n&gt; something better by level 15 I&#39;d go back and deal with the Slavers.  I still<br/>\n&gt; have all the components in the bank so all I would need are the fibulas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll look for Genmay though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Airbourne<br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; Raido<br/>\n&gt; (the name depends which server I&#39;m on)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n__________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\">http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
