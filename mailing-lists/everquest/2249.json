(plus, considering the amount of<br/>\ntime i&#39;ve put into playing my rogue, I know how<br/>\nfrustrating it is being SoW-less) I figure if for<br/>\nevery fifty SoW&#39;s I cast with my Druid, someone&#39;s alt<br/>\nDruid/Shammy will hopefully see fit to give my Rogue<br/>\none, and that&#39;s a damn fine deal. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nWeb-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
