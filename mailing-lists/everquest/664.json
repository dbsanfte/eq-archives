Glunk level 17 SK (a<br/>\nhybrid) and Obah level 16 Shaman (not a hybrid) both trolls, we kill a<br/>\ngreen. Glunk gets XP, Obah doesn&#39;t ?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the better posts on the lists I will post here.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nFrom: Elerion &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elerion@...\">elerion@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave been doing some testing with a friend of mine, playing our dwarves?<br/>\nBoth dwarfs, both just made 19 at the start of the test(withing one mob<br/>\nof<br/>\neach other), both fighting grouped exactly the same things(in the same<br/>\ngroup of only two). I tried to eliminate all factors i could, he is a<br/>\npaladin , i am a warrior. I current have 19 and 4 bubbles of exp, he has<br/>\n19<br/>\nand 2 bubbles of experience. So , if someone tells me there is no hybrid<br/>\npenalty hehe, tell my friend. This is after about 4 hours of testing,<br/>\nfighting &quot;yellow&quot; orcs in oasis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought you would want to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaeland, 16th Ranger<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nnote. I thought getting 2 bubbles of xp at 19 in 4 hours was quite<br/>\nimpressive, 4 is downright scary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome have even said various race/class combos cop penalties.<br/>\nie. a woodelf ranger cops one of the largest penalties in the game for<br/>\nbeing race well suited to a hybrid. Even using the primitive rule of 20%<br/>\nfor race and 20% for hybrid is depending on how they work it is 40% or<br/>\n44% extra slug to get a level. btw. I usually hear 25% penalty for<br/>\nhybrid ?<br/>\n<br/>\nYet on the spoilers sites someone produced a list of the order of xp<br/>\npenalties (prolly just made up), where they said particular races had<br/>\nmore or less penalty, with only hybrids copping a class penalty? Yet<br/>\nothers say there is certain hard levels for certain classes (in addition<br/>\nto the hell levels which I believe are 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 ?).<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one actually does know for certain. Except to say there are penalties<br/>\nfor both race and hybrids. Oh dying alot is a big penalty ..... that I<br/>\ndo know.<br/>\n--<br/>\nSean O&#39;Brien<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sobrien@...\">sobrien@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
