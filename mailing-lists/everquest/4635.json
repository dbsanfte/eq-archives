My pet and I have been killing Greater Scalebones and Greater <br/>\nSkeletons in Kurn&#39;s Tower. Started there 2 days ago at level 14, and <br/>\nam now a couple small bubbles from 18. I have been donating for a KEI <br/>\nbuff in PoK before I go there, and in turn have been casting Breeze, <br/>\nMist, Strength, Rune I, Quickness, and Intellectual Advancement <br/>\nspells on other players in Kurn&#39;s to try and help them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been buffing my pet with Mist, Strength, Quickness, Rune I, <br/>\nand myself with those buffs plus Intellectual Advancement and <br/>\nShielding. I use Root when there is only one target around, and Mez <br/>\non a target when there are others in the area. Then I hit them with <br/>\nChaotic Feedback and Choke, alternating until the target breaks the <br/>\nMez/Root and then my pet finishes it off. I read somewhere that this <br/>\nis called &quot;Root and Nuke&quot; and that it isn&#39;t very effective. I am <br/>\nwondering if there are other ways I should be going about trying to <br/>\nfight as opposed to this? Should I be using my dagger in combination <br/>\nto the rooting/nuking? Any feedback would be great. Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\nEnie, Erudite Enchantress<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
