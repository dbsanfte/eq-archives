It is beautifully done, and well populated with <br/>\nmobs in my level range.  I&#39;m not sure about merchants, but there is a <br/>\nbanker.  Some people were having trouble binding there, so you may <br/>\nwant to go to Qeynos first.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all you cityfolk you get there through Surefall Glade.  It is in <br/>\nthe caves behind the falls.  And there also appear to be some new <br/>\nquest people around.  And make sure you wipe you feet!  You&#39;re in my <br/>\nhouse now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe new UI looks good, and the spell icons are great.  Now I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to figure out which buff is going, or which one I&#39;m missing.  It <br/>\ndid need some rearranging, but overall it&#39;s an improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n39th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\nTerris-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
