You report<br/>\nthat your account has been compromised and they will<br/>\ntemporarly ban the account so no further possible<br/>\ndamage can be done.  To be honest, how many accounts<br/>\nhave been compromised.. that aren&#39;t caused by players<br/>\nhanding out their account information to &quot;so called&quot;<br/>\nfriends in the game?  This is not a flame..  It&#39;s only<br/>\nmeant as a reminder - this is a personal responsiblity<br/>\nof all players.  In my 2+ years playing this game, I<br/>\nhave witnessed only one so called compromise.  It<br/>\ninvolved a player handing out his information to a<br/>\nfriend.  How many of us lend our car keys out to<br/>\npeople we have merely met over the phone? =)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust keep your information under guard and you most<br/>\nlikely will never have this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuHase..
