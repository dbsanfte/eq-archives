Then more memory. At the present <br/>\nprices you could probably get a gforce 3 plus up your memory to 512 <br/>\nfor around $200. It would be a good move. I have even seen gforce 4ti <br/>\nfor around $175. Hopefully you have agp slots. I have only pci, so I <br/>\ncannot do as I have recommended for you. sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Rob LeBeau &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I just bought a new machine and have a question.
