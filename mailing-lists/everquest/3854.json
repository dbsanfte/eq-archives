The 52<br/>\n&gt; iksar monk has his epic weapon, sash of the dragonborn, embued<br/>\n&gt; fighters staff, pantherskin, and fbss just to name a few items. He<br/>\n&gt; is full decked out in high end items, quest gear, planar gear, ect.<br/>\n&gt; The 59 dark elf necro almost has his epic, all spells up to 59 and<br/>\n&gt; some 60 spells. He has alot of quest and planar gear on. Both of<br/>\n&gt; these are on Cazic-Thule server.<br/>\n&gt; The 47 druid is on Ayonae ro, doesnt have much. Has all his<br/>\n&gt; spells, and testament of vanear. There are about 10 other characters<br/>\n&gt; ranging from 5-35 on the servers.
