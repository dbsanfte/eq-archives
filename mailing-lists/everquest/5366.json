I<br/>\n&gt; brought my mother&#39;s lvl 41 druid to sit invis on the sidelines while my 56<br/>\n&gt; cleric and a 52 druid soloed the elysian mobs. She snared and dotted them<br/>\n&gt; and kited them until I rooted them and used my undead dots. I was doing<br/>\n&gt; 190dmg every 6 seconds with my dots. They do have alot of HP though. and<br/>\n&gt; they hit pretty hard. The arms dropped twice and so did the tunic. So both<br/>\n&gt; druids got arms and tunic. It was fun!<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.544 / Virus Database: 338 - Release Date: 11/25/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
