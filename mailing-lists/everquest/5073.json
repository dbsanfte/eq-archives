It will just have in item description that<br/>\nit has one slot, type 4, and whether or not it&#39;s empty. Plus you have to<br/>\ncombine them. I guess sort of like combining things in the cube in diablo.<br/>\nEven if you don&#39;t have the dye you can preview the way you will look with<br/>\nthe dye. It doesn&#39;t dye the actual armor piece, it dyes that slot on your<br/>\nbody. So if you change armor, your new armor will be the same color. You can<br/>\ntoy with the Red Green Blue value and pick color combos you like in various<br/>\nplaces. I&#39;ve seen trolls wearing hot pink. It&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>\nCool! Heh. I think the little froggie guards like me. Unless they are<br/>\nundead, most frogloks like me. My undead faction in lower guk is bottomed<br/>\nout though.
