I tried to equip it with no <br/>\nsuccess.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nleft click on your club and drag it to the large square area on your<br/>\ninventory screen, this is the auto equip. if it pops back into your<br/>\ninventory instead of going into your primary weapon slot, then either<br/>\nyou&#39;ve got something already there or you&#39;re having technical<br/>\ndifficulties. i played a vah-shir shaman for quite some time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I have no money. No one wants to buy mushrooms (must be a <br/>\ndrug free town). I think that I need to somehow come up with some <br/>\nmoney so that I can buy a scroll with a spell that can do damage. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t seem to be able to kill anything bare handed. I just keep <br/>\ngetting killed. Does anybody have any suggestions?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nthe are you should be in to kill things should be over the bridge. make<br/>\nsure to take the bridge on the side of the city that had registrar<br/>\nbindarah on it. keep going and you&#39;ll eventually zone and come out in an<br/>\narea that has lots of vah-shir under tents. fight the creatures in this<br/>\narea if you haven&#39;t been already, they are the easiest. after they&#39;re<br/>\ndead right click on their corpses and loot all the goodies off of them<br/>\nwhen they have them. these are the things you sell for cash.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I could delete the character, start over, maybe sell one or both of <br/>\nmy spell scrolls and buy an attack spell scroll. But do I really <br/>\nneed to? Is there still hope for my character?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nnumber one, you can&#39;t sell scrolls once they&#39;ve been scribed into your<br/>\nspell book. they&#39;re yours for life. back in the room where you met your<br/>\nshaman guild trainer, right click him and put training points in 1hand<br/>\nblunt. just outside of this room there is another room with people<br/>\ncalled scribes, they sell your spells. right click them to see what<br/>\nthey&#39;ve got to sell an then right click and hold on each spell to see<br/>\nthe info on them. each spell will tell you what level you have to be to<br/>\nuse it. keep looking through the scribes until you find the one selling<br/>\nyour level 1 spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nhope this helps. if you were on the ayonae ro server i could meet and<br/>\nhelp you out personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaaxton</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
