We hardly ever random for<br/>\nanything. When i or GM leads an event we just collect the loot, or someone<br/>\nthat we called out collects the loot. Later we divide the loot to people we<br/>\nfeel are worth the loot. We do random a few not so good stuff when they drop<br/>\ntho, but when it&#39;s godly/uber stuff that drops it may even go to someone<br/>\nthat isn&#39;t attending that perticular event.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard for me to give another point of view but basicly i wouldnt join a<br/>\ngroup unless we divide the loot so that everyone got a chance to get<br/>\nsomething, be it a gem or an item, but all should get one thing to bring<br/>\nhome when the group breakes up. Guess i&#39;m saying, random or not, if you won<br/>\nlast random you wount random again till the whole group got something to be<br/>\nhappy over. If it&#39;s a class item (read: FBSS to meleer and so on) only the<br/>\nclass that can use it randoms.<br/>\n<br/>\n-domi<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tKnight [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:knight@...\">knight@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, May 03, 2001 12:17 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EverQuest] Rolling for loot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Since there&#39;s been a lot of talk on loot order, I thoguht I&#39;d ask what<br/>\n&gt; everyone<br/>\n&gt; uses as a fair assesment for Rolling for loot or how one determines who<br/>\n&gt; gets a<br/>\n&gt; particular item.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   What I found that seemed to be working well is Blackjack Rolls.  Someone<br/>\n&gt; a long<br/>\n&gt; while back showed this to me.  Basically you roll from 1 to 30.  The<br/>\n&gt; person closest<br/>\n&gt; to 21 without going over wins.   This seems to even out those who<br/>\n&gt; consistantly average<br/>\n&gt; low rolls in the 1-100 randoms.  In over 2 years of playing and using the<br/>\n&gt; random 1-100<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;ve never won or came close to an upper limit.   With blackjack random or<br/>\n&gt; even a<br/>\n&gt; raondom 1-100 and the closest to 50 is the winner, seems to average things<br/>\n&gt; out.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   The problem with this is that most people (especially those that<br/>\n&gt; seemingly roll high)<br/>\n&gt; love the 1-100 random.  When I suggest the mid range win or blackjack<br/>\n&gt; roll, the first <br/>\n&gt; time they lose to it, they want to go back to the 1-100 again.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   What do you all use as a random or what &#39;rules&#39; do you use for<br/>\n&gt; distributing the good<br/>\n&gt; loot or when using Random?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ciao,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -Knight   - I still like BlackJack rolls.  I can&#39;re remember the guys<br/>\n&gt; name that first<br/>\n&gt;             showed it to me though.  :(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
