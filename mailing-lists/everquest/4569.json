I did the Stein Quest twice today. Cast Illusion:DE <br/>\non my Lvl 14 Erudite Enchanter, and cast Alliance on Clurg. I conned <br/>\nClurg as Amiable both times. Both times I said &quot;What special book&quot;, <br/>\nhe replied, and I gave him the compodium. Then he said something <br/>\nlike &quot;You must have worked hard to get my book, I am indebted to you. <br/>\nI don&#39;t like being indebted, so take this as payment&quot;. He didn&#39;t give <br/>\nme anything; no PP, no stein. I petitioned the GM. Does anyone have a <br/>\nclue as to what is going on?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\ni do know they have been doing something to the illusions recently.  heard that you can&#39;t use illusion wolf to buy from the brownies anymore, only druid wolfform works.  that will disappoint alot of enchanters I know, the distilled mana spells are on those brownies.  Makes it 10 times harder to get them.<br/>\nI would petition until you get a response, sounds like you did everything right, the racial illusions are supposed to be working correctly, it&#39;s just the other types of illusions that aren&#39;t supposed to be giving faction changes.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
