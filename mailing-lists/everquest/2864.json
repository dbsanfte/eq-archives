Casters can be <br/>\ndifficult until you get the hang of things.  Warriors, Rangers and <br/>\nPaladins are good for a beginning.  SK&#39;s take some experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PvP and roleplaying servers are also for more experienced <br/>\nplayers, but you can dive in if you want.  The game will be a little <br/>\nharder to learn, but who knows?  You may find a mentor!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd do try out several characters.  And check out the EQ sites for <br/>\ncreations guides, unless you just want to go for it!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd most of all, have fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n36th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\nTerris-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
