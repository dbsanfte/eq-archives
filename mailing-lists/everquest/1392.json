I mean just a few minutes on the web and you<br/>\ncould get the answer to all of them with the exception of maybe a small<br/>\nhandful but you could find those as well.  I filled it out and answered &quot;I<br/>\ndont know, but I am sure I could find out on the www if I wanted.  However I<br/>\ndont think that&#39;s what you want.&quot;  Or something very close to that.  I got<br/>\npicked but then turned it down because they didn&#39;t pick me until a couple<br/>\nweeks before I went on my 6 month cruise.
