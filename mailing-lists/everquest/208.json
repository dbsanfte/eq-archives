From what I have<br/>\nread and heard, Misty Thicket is an excellent place to hunt for<br/>\nmonks 5-10. I am planning on going there soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I have heard because of the quickness of your hands<br/>\nand feet, you should really use hands more than weapons. I<br/>\ntried using Rusty Hammers and Worn Great Staffs, but have had<br/>\nmore success at using my hands and feet. You are supposed to<br/>\nget 3 hits in with hands and feet as opposed to 1 with weapons.<br/>\nThis will come in handy later on when attacking spell casters. <br/>\nThe quicker you hit them the better chance you will have to <br/>\ninterupt their spells and without the spells they are dead meat.<br/>\nAnd I know the thing about &quot;Well Weapons do more damage&quot;.<br/>\nThis is true but if you take by the damage you inflect each <br/>\nround you will get more damage with the hands. Ie:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHands and Feet @ level 5 (3 punches at 6 each)  18 dmg<br/>\n\tHammers @ level 5 (1 hit at 12 dmg)\t\t12 dmg<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJust some things I have found out. Hope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:30 PM 5/4/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Brady Maxwell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brady_maxwell@...\">brady_maxwell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello All,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have a 5th level monk in freeport on fennin ro. I<br/>\n&gt;decided early on to use dual hammers as weapons this<br/>\n&gt;seems to work out well my stats are ( Or close to) DW<br/>\n&gt;38 OF 27 Def 28 HTH 12 Kick 17. So here are my<br/>\n&gt;questions. One should I give up on the Hammers and<br/>\n&gt;just use my fists ( They seem to do simular damage I<br/>\n&gt;just like the Hammers) Or should I keep using the<br/>\n&gt;hammers or switch to another weapon. Also I have been<br/>\n&gt;looking for hammers better than rusty but cant find<br/>\n&gt;any to purchase and dont know where to look. I have<br/>\n&gt;asked around but to no avail. One more question, where<br/>\n&gt;near freeport should I be adventuring to find better<br/>\n&gt;stuff. I have tried the bandits but they kill me quick<br/>\n&gt;and whoever I am with. The Fire Bugs and Armidillas<br/>\n&gt;are the only mobs that still give exp. Every once in a<br/>\n&gt;while I can take out a puma or jackal when I can find<br/>\n&gt;them. I am a half a bubble away from 6 so my guess is<br/>\n&gt;that the Fire Bugs and armmildillas wont be providing<br/>\n&gt;exp much longer. Also has anyone ever looted anything<br/>\n&gt;from an armidilla? Well any other words of advice<br/>\n&gt;would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;The possibilities are endless!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist has something for everyone!<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
