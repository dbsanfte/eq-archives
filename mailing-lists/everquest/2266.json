A lvl 14 wood elf needed to <br/>\nget back home, but was short on cash. I had just ported into the area <br/>\nwhere he approached me. Just before that I had gotten a very nice <br/>\nreward for a few minutes of tracking. I gave the guy a free ride <br/>\nhome. When I arrived in BB I got a tell from someone offering 100pp <br/>\nfor a ride. I took the job. A job I would not have gotten had I not <br/>\nfelt generous after someone else had been generous to me. Sure, I <br/>\nsometimes get stiffed and sometimes get something I can&#39;t use as a <br/>\ntip, but for the most part I think I have been well rewarded. For me <br/>\nit is in character and adds to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Jeff Gaudry &lt;bgrifter@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thought I would move the discussion to a new thread.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I considered it myself... :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Now that I can port, I have decided to do so without<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thought of reward. Oh, of course I will go quite a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bit out of my way for an offer of good money, but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have found giving a port to someone unable to give<br/>\n&gt; &gt;much in return seems to add to the game in other ways<br/>\n&gt; &gt;than money. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m still pondering exactly how I feel about group<br/>\n&gt; ports. I don&#39;t think I could ever feel right about<br/>\n&gt; running around auctioning &quot;Porting to NK, BB, SF, Tox<br/>\n&gt; and WC for 50pp per seat&quot;, but I do personally think<br/>\n&gt; that a small donation is the right thing when<br/>\n&gt; recieving a port. (not that i&#39;d ever actively demand<br/>\n&gt; one) As someone who&#39;s probably spent a couple hundred<br/>\n&gt; plat on ports over the last while, I just see the<br/>\n&gt; standard 10pp donation is a small way of saying<br/>\n&gt; &quot;thanks for your time&quot;. Again, not required, but a<br/>\n&gt; nice gesture. It&#39;s most certainly a larger commitment<br/>\n&gt; than SoW... (I still can&#39;t feel right about taking<br/>\n&gt; donations for a SoW though, the guy with the HQ Bear<br/>\n&gt; Pelt was rather persistant, but I usually stubbornly<br/>\n&gt; refuse &#39;em :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; Web-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
