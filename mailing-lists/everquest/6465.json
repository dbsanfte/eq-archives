But I haven&#39;t actually gotten xp in<br/>\nover a year. I can&#39;t even get dialup where I live<br/>\nbecause the phone company has spliced my lines so<br/>\nbadly I can&#39;t even dial out to an ISP. They refuse to<br/>\nfix it and so far I haven&#39;t found any way to get them<br/>\nto. Too much other stuff to worry about frankly. Like<br/>\nfinding a lawyer to sue a doctor for malpractice, and<br/>\nstill working on repairing hurricane Rita damage.<br/>\nI currently have direcway Satellite-- which inherently<br/>\nhas latency. When I first got it with the Direcway<br/>\n4000 2-way the bandwidth was 800k down and about 50k<br/>\nup (allegedly 50k up-- clocked around 30k). Sometime<br/>\nlater when the modem died due to an incident with my<br/>\ncat and a glass of milk I got the newer Direcway 6000.<br/>\nDirecway then dropped the bandwidth to 500k down<br/>\n(without informing me). When I play world of warcraft<br/>\nI generally have between 1200 to 4000ms latency. Last<br/>\ntime I tried to get into EQ it just kept timing out on<br/>\nme.<br/>\nAs for my system, I have an AMD athlon thunderbird<br/>\n1.4Ghz processor, 1GB of DDR SDRAM, ASUS A7M266-M<br/>\nmotherboard, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128Mb vid card, and<br/>\nPhilips Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card.<br/>\nI plan on upgrading to an ASUS A8V Deluxe (rev 2)<br/>\nmotherboard, 2Gb Kingston PC3200 ValueRAM, and AMD<br/>\nAthlon 3500 2.0GHz processor (with venice core).<br/>\nI will be using my same video card, sound card, and<br/>\npower supply (Antec SmartPower 2.0 450W) and adding an<br/>\nadditional 300Gb harddrive.<br/>\nI&#39;m currently trying to figure out how to transfer all<br/>\nof my data from my puny primary drive and putting it<br/>\non the 300Gb drive and setting it as primary, then<br/>\nupgrading to the new mobo setup without having to use<br/>\na windows xp cd. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have restore<br/>\nCDs for my pc bc it didn&#39;t come with any software on<br/>\nCDs. One of those deals where HP partitioned the<br/>\nharddrive. Since the warrenty is up on it I doubt I<br/>\ncould get tech support from them.<br/>\nI wish I could figure out a way to just copy all of<br/>\nthe programs so that they would be installable. I<br/>\nshould have an extra OEM of xp laying around somewhere<br/>\nbut it got lost in all the chaos of the hurricane.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nSu&gt; what class are you?

At level 66 I still have trouble<br/>\nkilling level 30s. Mostly because of the damage<br/>\nmisreporting related to the lag. Although I haven&#39;t<br/>\nplayed in months. My connection has gotten so bad that<br/>\nI really can&#39;t play anymore. I tried doing an LDON a<br/>\nfew months ago but the lag got so bad that I was stuck<br/>\nfor 15 minutes unable to do anything. Zoning takes at<br/>\nleast 5 minutes. If I die it will take me 20 minutes<br/>\nat the very least to get back to my corpse. Sometimes<br/>\nan hour if I have to zone a lot.<br/>\nI really don&#39;t think the game is designed for<br/>\ncharacters of my class and level to be able to solo. <br/>\nI&#39;ve pretty much switched to World of Warcraft now<br/>\nbecause it doesn&#39;t do damage misreporting and death<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take too much time.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Just Me &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eeyore_95682@...\">eeyore_95682@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; After a year and a half of playing, I&#39;ve done a lot<br/>\n&gt; of group play and<br/>\n&gt; a lot of duoing, but I seem to enjoy soloing more<br/>\n&gt; nowdays.
