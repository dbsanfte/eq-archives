There is a nice <br/>\nshop near here that has been custom building systems for about 20 <br/>\nyears. I may check with them and see if they can cobble up something <br/>\nat a good price. I don&#39;t want to build it myself. Had enough of that <br/>\nback in the mid-80&#39;s. I think over the next year or so I will come up <br/>\nwith a servicable solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great Holiday Season.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; If you are looking for a new system, I recommend you go with an AMD <br/>\nAthlon<br/>\n&gt; processor. I know they have had problems with EQ in the past but <br/>\nthey cost<br/>\n&gt; much less than pentiums. I used to be loyal to pentiums but even <br/>\nthough my<br/>\n&gt; mother has more RAM in her computer and a 1.7GHz P4, my system with <br/>\na 1.4GHz<br/>\n&gt; AMD (both have same OS and both are HPs) runs faster. It cost $119 <br/>\nfor 256M<br/>\n&gt; of RAM for the P4. I&#39;d have to ask my dad how much he payed for my <br/>\nupcoming<br/>\n&gt; RAM, but for xmas he&#39;s getting me 1.2GHz of RAM. I also read some <br/>\narticles<br/>\n&gt; on building new computers and Pentiums run hotter and require <br/>\nspecial<br/>\n&gt; sockets and special RAM that all cost more than it costs for AMDs. <br/>\nFor a<br/>\n&gt; modem, you could try a V92 Zoom. I got one for about $21 (not <br/>\nincluding<br/>\n&gt; shipping) online. But that&#39;s for phone line modem. Once you figure <br/>\nout what<br/>\n&gt; you want, look up pricegrabber.com, epinions.com, pricewatch.com, <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; cnet.com. You can compare them and see which one has the lowest <br/>\nprice and<br/>\n&gt; best review.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I bought my machine last year for Christmas. A gift for the <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It was a mid-range system at that time, though I did not know that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the 256k memory limit would make it low-end so quickly. I added a <br/>\n3d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; card at about six months, not knowing that the standard was moving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ahead so fast. With the knowledge I now have, I may have scraped <br/>\nup a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bit more and bought higher end, but it was not then a good <br/>\neconomic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; move.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I will be adding enough memory in a few weeks to bring my system <br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to it&#39;s 256k max. I ordered sol in the summer, with the <br/>\nexpectation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that the 128k minimum would be in place when released. I found <br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my max would now be the new minimum.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As is the system is nominally playable. With the new memory and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; possibly a new graphics card (fortunately the cost of a gforce 2 <br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dropped to an easily reachable level) the machine will serve. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expect Sony/V will make improvements in the game to keep lower end<br/>\n&gt; &gt; players viable for some time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now I must plan to upgrade hardware and catch up, perhaps pull <br/>\nahead<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the curve a bit so I am not always catching up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I am not able to scrape up the $4k bucks for a real<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kick-ass system like I see in the magazines. I will probably see <br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a new tower with lots of memory, a gforce 3 and a good sized hard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drive will cost me, and begin saving in hopes of getting it online<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before this system gets too old to play.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For those of us on the lower end, we must hope Sony/V wants our <br/>\nbucks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough to keep us alive a bit longer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
