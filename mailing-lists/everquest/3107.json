","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1964731196\">No way Baby.<br/>\nEQ lives...................lol<br/>\n<br/>\nOk How about this topic.<br/>\nWhat do you all prefer..............(loaded question )<br/>\nUnrest or High Pass and High Keep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have played in both and like them a lot but I am not<br/>\nsure which I prefer.  The issue I have with Unrest is<br/>\nthat the closest bind/sell point is Kaladim or<br/>\nKelethin for noncasters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also seen that Unrest drops some of the best or<br/>\nmost sought after stuff in the game. Most stuff I have<br/>\nbeen looting is ok but I would not say Fantastic. <br/>\nNOW...I am only level 19 Ranger and pulling from the<br/>\n1st floor.  Does Unrest get better as you go up in<br/>\nlevel?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I like about High Keep is that I can bank<br/>\nthere and bind there.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour thoughts appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- silly_girl4ever &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silly_girl4ever@...\">silly_girl4ever@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; WOW,  this list has been quiet the last few days...<br/>\n&gt; Eveyone playing <br/>\n&gt; neverwinter nights or something?<br/>\n&gt; Katashaka<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
