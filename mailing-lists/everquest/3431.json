What is OS?<br/>\nKC might be a good idea. Thanks!<br/>\nSpeaking of jaggedpine I had someone beg me to come to Qeynos Hills with<br/>\nthem to rez a bunch of people who were killed in some sort of GM event. all<br/>\nkinds of npcs were in front of surefall glade. I hung out and rezzed people<br/>\nthen after waiting and finding they might not be able to make it happen<br/>\nagain for another hour or more I decided to head out and get some sleep.<br/>\nWas anyone around for an event of that type in Qhills?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly 2 places like that are Vox&#39;s lair (only inside it where she is, NOT<br/>\nthe rest of the zone) and Naggy&#39;s lair (same thing). Any OTHER part of the<br/>\nzone is 100% normal for all levels, and can be gone into. As for exp...try<br/>\nKarnor&#39;s and  OS. Jaggedpine might be a good bet too.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Su<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, July 28, 2002 12:38 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [EverQuest] Hunting grounds for 50+<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place to hunt<br/>\nto<br/>\n  get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>\n  Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the other<br/>\n  parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is there..<br/>\n  does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I<br/>\nwill<br/>\n  hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to<br/>\nzone<br/>\n  beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the<br/>\nhigher<br/>\n  lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>\n  Any suggestions?<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
