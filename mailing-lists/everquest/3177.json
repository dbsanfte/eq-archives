After some<br/>\nresearch, I found that the reason I am not hitting as<br/>\nmuch as others is because I have been switching<br/>\nbetween 2HS and 1HS weapons to increase the skills of<br/>\neach attribute.  <br/>\n<br/>\nExample: My skill in both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br/>\nattack is at like 152.  If I were to just use 1HS<br/>\nlet&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have proved this because now that I am using the 1HS<br/>\nmore, the skill is close to 30 and my ATK rating is<br/>\nclose to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is still at<br/>\n152.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you continue to alternate both weapon types or<br/>\nwould you just pick one and go with it?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHanks<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
