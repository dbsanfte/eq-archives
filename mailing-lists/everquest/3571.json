We do all the<br/>\nwork and maitencance on the 300-400 servers in<br/>\nproduction and QA.<br/>\n<br/>\nA nice field, if you like the techie stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck, maybe see you online.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat server are you playing on?<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shulse7@...\">shulse7@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hey Rob,<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the help and advice but it mysteriously<br/>\n&gt; came <br/>\n&gt; back to life last night as if nothing ever happened!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Damn computers! The problem was that I couldn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; get <br/>\n&gt; to a point where I could run the system restore<br/>\n&gt; option. <br/>\n&gt; As I start up the first thing I see is the Dell<br/>\n&gt; splash <br/>\n&gt; screen then it would proceed into booting up<br/>\n&gt; windows. <br/>\n&gt; Well it would get passed the Dell screen and then <br/>\n&gt; immediately go to a white screen telling me it<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; find any drives. Usually one can boot off a floppy<br/>\n&gt; or <br/>\n&gt; CDRom, I couldn&#39;t even do that! Being a laptop and<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; drives are interchangeable, I wasn&#39;t even getting<br/>\n&gt; power <br/>\n&gt; to the other drives. I was figuring something went<br/>\n&gt; wrong <br/>\n&gt; with the SCSI management on a hardware basis and<br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; the only repair option was to send it in. I hadn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; contacted Dell yet, I was mostly venting and<br/>\n&gt; throwing a <br/>\n&gt; fit. ;-) When I went to Dell&#39;s site to chat with<br/>\n&gt; support <br/>\n&gt; the stupid thing started working again and has been<br/>\n&gt; fine <br/>\n&gt; ever since. I uninstalled SP3 though!<br/>\n&gt; My level is pretty good, thanks for the<br/>\n&gt; consideration, <br/>\n&gt; not to many people are that way anymore. I&#39;m getting<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ready to test on my Win2k MCSE so wish me luck! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks again!<br/>\n&gt; Steve<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
