I&#39;ve yet to see a way to <br/>\nbring this number up or down. Mine has been at 15 ever since the expansion <br/>\ncame out.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a stat at the bottom of my player stat window that says<br/>\nCorruption.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume that is updated when a character commits an offense against<br/>\nhis home town like attacking a member of one of their allies or, worse<br/>\nstill, attacking someone in his own city. Please correct me if I&#39;m<br/>\nwrong about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy corruption stat is 15. Is there a way to remove corruption?<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Shopping has everything on your holiday list.
