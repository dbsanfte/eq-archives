Ask others for advice. Find some people you really like hanging with<br/>\nand put them on friends list. Then if you see them on contact them. Find out<br/>\nif you can hang out with people who seem to get along with you really well.<br/>\nNo stalking though. :-)<br/>\nI have friends that I met in the game who like to group with me or help me<br/>\nout. I help them out. A guild is a wonderful thing as well. My guildies and<br/>\nI like to get together and hang out. It&#39;s fun. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know it is hard to say. I am just not very good at most of the<br/>\naspects of EQ like camping items and meeting people to play with. I tend to<br/>\njust go where everyone else my level is and join pickup groups. I hate<br/>\nplaying alone. It just seems like the game would be ten times better if you<br/>\nhad a group of friends to play with.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Su<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, April 04, 2002 7:16 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Hi, I am new<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Welcome back to EQ!<br/>\n  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since September of 2000 or so. I obviously enjoy<br/>\n  playing. :-) I&#39;m not sure exactly what kind of advice you&#39;re asking for<br/>\n  here. Anything specific you need to know about?<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. I am not a very good EQ<br/>\n  player. I would consider myself ultra competent in group battles, but in<br/>\n  other aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I have never gotten a<br/>\n  character past level 40. My first character was an Erudite Enchanter by<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to level 40 after two years<br/>\nor<br/>\n  so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which was my friends character but<br/>\nI<br/>\n  own it. I just started playing again after giving up on the game and<br/>\nplaying<br/>\n  DAOC. Eventually I gave up all MMORPGS deciding they were a waste of time.<br/>\n  About a week ago, I decided to give EQ another chance and have decided<br/>\nthat<br/>\n  it has improved a great deal. I am now playing a Human Ranger who is level<br/>\n  30. I really like the character. His buffs and damage spells are great. I<br/>\n  guess I could use some help on how to be a good EQ player. I have been<br/>\n  playing for about two years and I feel like I know absolutely nothing<br/>\nabout<br/>\n  the game. I have never belonged to a good guild or anything. I play on the<br/>\n  Xegony server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
