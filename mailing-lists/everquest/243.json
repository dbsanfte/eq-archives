PCs<br/>\ncreating more lag  would seem logical for most NPCs dont have lots of   <br/>\nitems with various stats, and or skills, etc speech trade skills etc to   <br/>\nhave to load into memory as PCs do, unless someone can pretty much prove   <br/>\nto me that NPCs and PCs should have no effect, i will have to conclude   <br/>\nthat my observation is correct,<br/>\nDoublestar<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJoin the Star Wars craze!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nSet up your Star Wars list at ONElist.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
