No one needed you it also took away <br/>\nfrom bards as mana batteries.  I am glad they balanced it.  The <br/>\nreason you are upset with your toon is its off the crack and feeling <br/>\nthe shock of withdrawal.  Suck it up and learn to play your toon.  <br/>\nYou will be glad you did later.  Its easy to play any class if its <br/>\ntwinked out or buffed to the hilt.  Find a class you like buck naked <br/>\nand unbuffed thats where you will be happy in the long haul.  For me <br/>\nit was the Monk and Beastlord. A good place to try all the classes is <br/>\non the test server do the test buff and bam your 25 with decent gear.<br/>\n                  PS. For those of you with an eye for grammer and <br/>\nspelling, what can I say but enjoy =O`  /wink<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                          My 2 copper Hawg</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
