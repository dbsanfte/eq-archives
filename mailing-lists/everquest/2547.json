He asks you to bring him","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-994373554\">Here&#39;s a quest to get a weapon better than rusty..<br/>\nGo to the Ranger guild (one level up from the druid guild) and find Dill<br/>\nFireshine. He asks you to bring him two orc hatchets from the &quot;blue<br/>\nmeanies&quot;. The merchants sell them for 6pp a piece so it&#39;s not worth buying<br/>\nthem. Just look for an orc pawn that has an axe. Check to make sure it&#39;s a<br/>\nhatchet and not a rusty axe. When you have two hatchets, give them to you<br/>\nand he usually gives you two weapons in return. If you can&#39;t use them or<br/>\nthink they suck, then sell them to the merchant that you have the best<br/>\nfaction with.<br/>\nAlso, if you run around the area near the lifts and the ruins, sometimes a<br/>\nbright green patch spawns on the ground. It&#39;s evergreen leaves. They sell<br/>\nfor about 2 to 5pp a piece depending on who your buyer is and how much they<br/>\nwant to spend.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re high enough to go into Butcherblock then start to follow the path<br/>\n(right after you zone in from Faydark) and instead of keeping to the path,<br/>\nrun straight accross to the two houses (right thru the pit). along the way<br/>\nOak Bark sometimes spawns on the ground. That is an item that sells for a<br/>\ngood price too. It&#39;s rarer.<br/>\nThat&#39;s assuming you are a woodelf druid though.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I need to find a better Melee weapon for my young, on<br/>\n&gt; her own Druid, Amaiya (Ayonae Ro).  BF had suggested<br/>\n&gt; asking around for a Fine Steel Scimitar but I have so<br/>\n&gt; little money right now and the guy I talked to last<br/>\n&gt; night wanted 10pp for the one he had...sheeeesh, I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t even have 1pp yet...lol(but hey I am having<br/>\n&gt; fun)..sow, no wait, that should be so, any suggestions<br/>\n&gt; on a less expensive &quot;weapon&quot; and where i might find<br/>\n&gt; it.  I tend to hang out close to the lifts so I can<br/>\n&gt; run like hell if I have to so if there is somewhere<br/>\n&gt; near there that would be helpful...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wishing you all safe travels..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Amaiya, the Evercurious<br/>\n&gt;  Druid, Ayonae Ro (aka as Naara)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
