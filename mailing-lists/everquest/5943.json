Already the servers are<br/>\n&gt; populated with a lot of people.  Yet EQ2 does<br/>\n&gt; something EQ1 doesn&#39;t.  It will create a new<br/>\n&gt; instance of the zone and give you a choice so that<br/>\n&gt; it can balance out the increasing number of people. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve noticed a difference in the lag factor when I<br/>\n&gt; join a populated instance versus a non-populated<br/>\n&gt; instance.  I&#39;m not sure how they do it, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pretty cool.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve created 3 characters: Raido, Wulfric, and<br/>\n&gt; Celric.    Raido is of course a wood elf priest,<br/>\n&gt; soon to be druid.  He is currently level 8 and<br/>\n&gt; finished the first part of his priest training. <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric is a half elf fighter, currently level 7,<br/>\n&gt; and just gained his Qeynos citizenship last night. <br/>\n&gt; Celric is a dark elf priest and has yet to<br/>\n&gt; experience the world of Norath.  All 3 characters<br/>\n&gt; are on Crushbone server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I created Wulfric and Celric, I ran into a bit<br/>\n&gt; of trouble because the names wouldn&#39;t get past the<br/>\n&gt; name filter.  I assume it had to do with the *ric*<br/>\n&gt; in both names and possibly alluding to profane words<br/>\n&gt; that sound similar.   But I had used both names on<br/>\n&gt; the Beta server so I put in a CS ticket, and a GM<br/>\n&gt; responded about a few hours later (something you<br/>\n&gt; never see happen in EQ1).  We discussed it and he<br/>\n&gt; went ahead and changed the names for me so I could<br/>\n&gt; use them.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, one thing I noticed, there does nto seem to<br/>\n&gt; be a drop feature for items.  You can either trade<br/>\n&gt; it, sell it, or destroy it, but you can&#39;t drop it. <br/>\n&gt; I guess the citizens of Qeynos don&#39;t want random<br/>\n&gt; items littering their city.  Hopefiully it&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; implemented soon.  But so far the game is much kick<br/>\n&gt; ass.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope to see you all there!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric/Raido/Celric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.yahoo.com\">http://my.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
