Languages and <br>other skills like 1 hb 2 hb and slashing can be \ntrained way on past <br>21 at your trainer depending on your level.&nbsp; My \ndruid has always used <br>a 1hb When I decided to het a scimitar at lv 48 I \ntrained as high as <br>I could and it was costing several plat a point&nbsp; I \npaid over a <br>hundred to gain skill level at trainer.&nbsp; \n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been on almost 4 years and it has been this way \nthe entire <br>time I have&nbsp; played. I beleive the reason trade skills are \ncapped at <br>21 is to create player based economy for and to reward those \nwilling <br>to go out and put the work in \nsomething.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nMy 2 \ncopper,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nHogg<br><br></font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
