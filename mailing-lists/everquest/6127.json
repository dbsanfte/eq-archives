Added new wayfarer type camps and new zones. You can now zone into the bazaar from PoK. There is also a guild hall where you can summon your corpse to and have it rezzed by any available clerics. There is now ingame email to send messages to people when they are offline... A whole guild messenging center in the guild hall where people can look for guilds and guilds can look for people.<br/>\nIf you get mnemonic retention with AA points it gives you a 9th spellslot... There are new quests and such..<br/>\nRight now they are celibrating the 6th anniversary so there are fabled mobs and a scavenger hunt quest going.<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I can really think of right now.
