Kinda <br/>\nbeen wondering about getting a group of Halfling Druids together to <br/>\ntackle the elementals on the island in the Twilight Sea. Plenty of <br/>\npower for ports, defeating summond creatures, and healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought of one as primary porter and evac officer, and back-up <br/>\nhealer. At least two to dismiss summond, and at least one dedicated <br/>\nhealer. Seems that a group like this should be able to kill quickly <br/>\nand keep mana up enough to continue doing so for some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
