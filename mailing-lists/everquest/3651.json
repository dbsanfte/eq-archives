I have several <br/>\nnotebooks full of them. I doubt I&#39;ll buy Sony&#39;s version as I&#39;ve <br/>\nheard it&#39;s not as detailed or accurate. Even if you buy it you&#39;ll <br/>\nstill need EQ Atlas for those details.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also share many peoples disappointment in the name. EQ Atlas is <br/>\nTHE place to get maps. Sony had many choices for names, and they <br/>\nknew how popular EQ Atlas is, so it seems they wanted to cash in on <br/>\nit. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying don&#39;t buy it, it will be an excellent resource. Just <br/>\nremember Muse when you need the real thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nTul.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;mlockridge01&quot; &lt;MLockridge01@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I will probably buy the forthcoming atlas, once it is out. It will <br/>\nbe <br/>\n&gt; cheaper than printing up the rest of the maps I don&#39;t have, since I <br/>\n&gt; have been only printing maps as I need them. Plus, we ran out of <br/>\nink <br/>\n&gt; and nobody in my household wants to be the one to spring for the <br/>\nnew <br/>\n&gt; ink. Probably because they know a large number of maps will be <br/>\n&gt; printed as soon as the ink is loaded. ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I would really like is to have eq in a window, with a second <br/>\n&gt; monitor to hold my data; maps, charts, lists, and recipes. I know <br/>\n&gt; there is a hack to allow this, but I would prefer a sanctioned <br/>\n&gt; window. Plus I don&#39;t have the horsepower on this system to carry <br/>\nsuch <br/>\n&gt; a load. My game would suffer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Twenty bucks for the atlas sounds cheaper all round.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
