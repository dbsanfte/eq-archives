I have found a few helpful people out there but it seems most <br/>\nare playing solo. Is this normal?  They suggest grouping so that is <br/>\nmy first question.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, I am having trouble getting money to get decent weapons.<br/>\nI am a level 3 Druid and only have a club.  One guy gave me some <br/>\nmoney but it wasn&#39;t much.  He suggested buying more spells, but I <br/>\nreally would like a good weapon.  Dealing 1-3 points of damage just <br/>\nisn&#39;t cutting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly for now, should I be starting with a fighter type until I <br/>\nreally get use the the game and interface.  I really love wizards and <br/>\nthose type of characters but understand if playing a warrior makes it <br/>\neasier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always get confused on where I am going. I think I venture too far <br/>\nout of the city area.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for letting the newbie post?  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nRob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
