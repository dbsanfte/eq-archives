The CS online was always good. If you needed a GM you might have to wait \nMAYBE up to an hour on a busy day but would get a GM. Now with the GM pool you \ncan wait days on end and still never get help from one. I have no problem with \nthe cost going up to $12.95 a month but the CS should go up with it or at least \nstay the same but it has gone down hill. They have become uncaring about the \ncustomers. Now they have a pocket pc version,EQ 2,SWG and gods knows what else. \nThey just don&#39;t care about the customers anymore and that is just a shame. When \nthey cared more about the customers&nbsp; you got things like Newbie armor(how \nlong has it been since you have seen any added like they promised?),spells that \ncould be used even if you did not buy the expansion,etc... \n</font></strong></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"pavisoj@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pavisoj@...\">Justin</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Thursday, November 07, 2002 3:40 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] EQIM: EverQuest \n  Instant Messaging</div>\n  <div><br></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay I have to step in \n  here.&nbsp; first of all customer service has always sucked.&nbsp; I used to \n  call before the stormhammer server went live using the 800 number and it was \n  always busy.&nbsp; Occasionally i would get through but that was few and far \n  between.&nbsp; Second of all those who play Stormhammer should get a little \n  more support due to the fact the server cost about $40/month instead of the \n  $12.95/month that you pay or I pay for that matter.&nbsp; Third have you tried \n  using the live tech support on the web site itself es you may wait a while \n  before someone comes on but when they do they take all the time you need to \n  get your problem solved.&nbsp; Also if you read the note that was posted on \n  the site you would have seen the reason they rasied the price of the \n  game.&nbsp; finally I like the game and disagree that the game is going \n  downhill, it is perfectly fine the way it is .&nbsp; I hate to say this if you \n  don&#39;;t likeit so much than why play.</font></div><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest \n  homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
