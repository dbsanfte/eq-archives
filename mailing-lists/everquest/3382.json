Lag was terrible. It <br/>\nwas hard to even get my cursor on target. I suppose it will be ok <br/>\nonce I get set up to sell, but the set up is terrible. Move cursor. <br/>\nNot on object. Move a bit more. Not on object. Move back. Click. <br/>\nDon&#39;t have object. Click again. Hmph. Had object but didn&#39;t know it, <br/>\nand just put it back. Click...<br/>\n<br/>\nTook so long that I didn&#39;t finish setting up before I had to log. I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have logged if I could have left my toon to do business <br/>\nwhile I was gone, but no such luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just gotta get another machine, faster connection, and retire from <br/>\nmy job so that I can play all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
