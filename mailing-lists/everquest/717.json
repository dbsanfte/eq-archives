I&#39;m part beta program, however i rarely<br/>\n&gt; play it now.. its neat when you first start playing.. then you find out<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; the game just sucks.. :)  cant put it any other way.  Graphics are ok..<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; the world is so large and the distance between them is almost unbearable.<br/>\n&gt; Its really annoying running for what seems forever, then losing your best<br/>\n&gt; item you spent all your loot on miles from where you last bound yourself.<br/>\n&gt; Hehe..  The AC world is so empty, almost as empty as their dungeons. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For those that don&#39;t know.. when you die in AC you temporary lose some of<br/>\n&gt; your stat numbers and..  your best item.   This item.. which is now<br/>\n&gt; available to anyone walking by.  nice aye.  EQ example...  One minute you<br/>\n&gt; have your rubi tunic, when you return to your corpse you find that a level<br/>\n1<br/>\n&gt; guy is now sporting your hard earned tunic.. Welcome to AC. hehe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Shane Bole [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 2:57 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Fed up with EQ - any ideas??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Shane Bole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; AC and UO both suck ass.

It seemed ok but all the<br/>\n&gt; things I thought that were nice about it later on sucked<br/>\n&gt; its annoying as hell plus the graphics suck, monster AI is sucky so you<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; solo your whole way to the top without getting hurt for 1 point of damage<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fammuin, level 16 Erudite Cleric, Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; Fabno Licious &lt;Warriors of Apocalypse&gt;, level 22 Erudite Enchanter,<br/>\nErollisi<br/>\n&gt; Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: kale eusi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 26, 1999 12:04 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] Fed up with EQ - any ideas??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;kale eusi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m rather fed up with Verant! They&#39;re constantly nerfing everything<br/>\n&gt; ingame<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s worth while, or ignoring classes that need to be balanced or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; upgraded! So in retrospect, I&#39;m looking to find greener pastures<br/>\n&gt; elsewhere.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps someone out there knows of another game (other than AC and UO)<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; perhaps a group who&#39;s programming their own game similar to EQ?
