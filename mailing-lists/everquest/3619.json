I tried what you suggested below and it actually <br/>\nworked! I adjusted my face and waited forever for my character to save. Then <br/>\nmy face stayed the same through multiple zones!

Pick your desired features<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using the /face command. Force a character save.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Zone into another area, still without head gear.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check yourself, you should be &quot;yourself&quot;. If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not...start over and try again. If you are okay,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then you should be okay and can put back on head<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gear/masks.
