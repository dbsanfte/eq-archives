I went to check them out and you know I have to say I was a little dissapointed in the guides. A lot of the information that they contain can be found at almost any EQ related website! It&#39;s basically that I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay for any of these guides, it&#39;s really not worth the money. The only thing I&#39;m truly interested in is making money. Man&nbsp;it sucks trying to get some decent armor when you have no money. I&#39;ve wondered about the &quot;make Plat at any level&quot; guides and&nbsp;I figured that you would still need to group or partner at some point. </p>\n<p>Either way I&#39;m having fun just going along and doing things the old fashioned way. I do suggest going and getting these guides because there were a few things in there that was nice to know about but for any player, especially noobs, I suggest doing it the old fashioned way and go out there and take the lumps and partner with some others. It&#39;s funner and you&#39;ll feel better knowing that you did it on your own. </p>\n<p>I got some good info about Unrest so&nbsp;I think I may go and try it out this week. </p>\n-- \n<p>_______________________________________________<br>\r\nSign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at <font color=\"#0000FF\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\">Mail.com</a></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Free price comparison tool gives you the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestbuyfinder.com/download.htm\">best prices and cash back!</a>&quot;</p></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
