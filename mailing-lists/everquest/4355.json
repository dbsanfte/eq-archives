I&#39;ll back<br/>\n&gt; track and see what I missed. My newbe weapon is a club. I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; been able to use it because it won&#39;t equip. Maybe that&#39;s because I<br/>\n&gt; need hand-to-hand training to use it. I&#39;ll check that out. Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Edward<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
