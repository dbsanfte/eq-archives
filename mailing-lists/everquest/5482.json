The quest was to kill the \nundead that walked the night.&nbsp; They would drop some sort of loot - \nmushrooms I think it was - and you handed these mushrooms to a priest that stood \non the shore.&nbsp; when the priest had collected enough mushrooms he would call \nforth a giant snake that would come up out of the water.&nbsp; The snake took up \nthe majority of the zone and required many many people to kill.&nbsp; I have no \nidea what the treasures were this snake was guarding for I never saw them with \nmy own eyes, but I did manage to get in some good wacks to its scaly hide.&nbsp; \n</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I also remember when the region known as Jagged \nPine was first discovered, the Qeynos militia had dilligently lined up outside \nthe entrance to Surefall Glade to fiend off any gnoll lurkers who got too \nclose.&nbsp; It was quite a spectacle to behold except that it caused for \nencumbering movement and seriously slowed down your transit between zones.&nbsp; \nWhether or not the gnoll trouble subsided or if the GMs realized the trouble the \nguards were causing on weary travelers, I don&#39;t know, but the militia has since \ndisappeared.&nbsp;

Do you remember your \n  first GM <br>event?&nbsp; Or even the most memorable.&nbsp; <br><br>Now I know \n  some of you are asking what are those!&nbsp; Back in the olden <br>days of \n  Everquest, before the new planes were revealed, before the <br>Nexus opened \n  and the moon Luclin moved closer to us, before the great <br>ice sheet that is \n  Velious was found there were mythical beings that <br>walked the land called \n  GM&#39;s.&nbsp; On certain occasions they would come <br>down to the lands of \n  Norrath and alter them.&nbsp; Sometimes they played <br>tricks, or reset a \n  zone to their own liking.&nbsp; Some of you may have <br>experienced this over \n  Christmas, or during Halloween.<br><br>When Tuldayen was a young and very \n  inexperienced Ranger roaming the <br>hills around Qeynos he was involved in \n  such an event.&nbsp; He awoke one <br>morning to find himself in the quiet of \n  Surefall Glade.&nbsp; He took up <br>his trusty Hickory Bow and sheathed his \n  now only tarnished long sword <br>and ventured out into the still unfamiliar \n  hills.&nbsp; But when he <br>entered the tunnel he was met by several of the \n  evil undead.&nbsp; He was <br>lucky enough to jump back into the protection of \n  the glade and <br>avoided death.&nbsp; He thought to himself &quot;where are those \n  guards&quot; and <br>ventured out again.<br><br>He was amazed by what he \n  found.&nbsp; The sky was a deep red, blood red.&nbsp; <br>The entire land was \n  filled with all manner of Skeletons.&nbsp; Many were <br>familiar to him, but \n  many more were not and some were 30 feet tall!&nbsp; <br>It was as if the \n  ancient battlefields of Norrath had spilled their <br>dead on the land.&nbsp; \n  Then he heard the wails of Varsoon the undying and <br>saw great magicks near \n  the ruins.&nbsp; He ran for his life toward the <br>City of Qeynos.&nbsp; When \n  he looked back there were a dozen of the evil <br>creatures behind him.&nbsp; \n  He made it to the city and found many like <br>him.&nbsp; Parties were formed \n  and we headed back to the hills to destroy <br>what evil we could.&nbsp; Oh, \n  many of us fell that day.&nbsp; We had the good <br>fortune to have obtained a \n  bind in the city.&nbsp; Experience was gained <br>and lost, many of us found \n  better weapons amongst the shattered bones <br>and plenty of gold was \n  found.<br><br>Eventually the hills filled with powerful adventurers and the \n  Guilds <br>called upon their members to gather for the war.&nbsp; The Undead \n  War <br>raged for days in the hills around Qeynos until at last enough blood \n  <br>had been spilled to satisify any God.&nbsp; Or GM! ;)<br><br>This was a \n  1-35 event that went for 8 actual hours.&nbsp; Tell us your <br>story, and \n  I&#39;ll tell you about day werewolves ravaged the West \n  <br>Commonlands!<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br><tt>\n  <hr width=\"500\">\n  <b>Yahoo!
