Because the DS is damaging them you don&#39;t have to hit as much as normal so your attack doesn&#39;t go up either. Yes being PL by a druid or a class equal to them will get you to 65 in a hurry but you&#39;re going to be a wimp unable to either take a hit or make a hit leading to yours and possibly your groups untimely death. You&#39;re also not going to be using your spells as much as they&#39;re going to be rooting the mobs for you.... can we say fizzle city here, you can&#39;t save your group or yourself if you can&#39;t cast once before your oom</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div>Feralkin&nbsp;Flaumigavylke&nbsp;</div>\n<div>65 Barbarian&nbsp;Feral Lord</div>\n<div>Silver Tears of Flame</div>\n<div>Quellious</div></div>\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-265734441IncrediOriginalMessage\"><i>-------Original Message-------</i></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div><tt>Skills, skills, skills, skills, skills, skills, skills!<br><br>I hate to be the one to say this but you really should focus on your battle skills. Trust me, at the lower levels that is a perfect time to get the skills built up. I can understand wanting to go in and just beat the heck out of everything and being uber and killing it all in one shot. But ponder this, When you get to be up in levels (50&#39;s, 60&#39;s, and 70&#39;s) you are going to be taking on some majorly nasty monsters. If you have just gained levels and have an uber weapon but never really worked on your fighting skills and they are low, it&#39;s not going to help you or your party out very much. Actually you will hurt your group more than help them. Now being a Shammy you have some awesome spells at higher levels. This is another thing I would suggest focusing on. If your at a higher level and your fighting say a dragon and 60% of your casts fizz <br>then you may as well run or be able to hit! (See first part otherwise your gonna get killed or your group killed.<br><br>That&#39;s just my 2 cents.<br><br></tt></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td id=\"ygrps-yiv-265734441INCREDIFOOTER\" width=\"100%\">\n<table cellSpacing=\"0\" cellPadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"100%\"></td>\n<td id=\"ygrps-yiv-265734441INCREDISOUND\" vAlign=\"bottom\" align=\"middle\"></td>\n<td id=\"ygrps-yiv-265734441INCREDIANIM\" vAlign=\"bottom\" align=\"middle\"></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
