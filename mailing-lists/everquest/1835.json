Anyway,<br/>\n&gt; for newbies I recommend that you hang out at the dwarf fishing camp<br/>\n&gt; and wait for someone to work over the named dorfs there. Hey drop<br/>\n&gt; serious weapons and ringmail armour. You may be able to get them to<br/>\n&gt; cough up some of the goods, since selling them locally will be tough<br/>\n&gt; as they are ruining their faction with the Citizens of Kaladim.<br/>\n&gt; Begging never hurt either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dagdason Level 35 Rogue - Drinal<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;MDMcMahon&quot; &lt;mdmcmahon@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rico,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Welcome to EQ. =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Firstly, way to go on choosing a cleric! hehe I&#39;m biased as I play<br/>\n&gt; a level 50 High Elf Cleric on Xegony. Clerics are a lot of fun imo.<br/>\n&gt; As a new cleric I agree with some of the statements made below. Being<br/>\n&gt; BRAND new, just solo around your starting point and loot everything.<br/>\n&gt; Sell that stuff and save all the money. You will need it for spells<br/>\n&gt; obviously and you&#39;ll also want to pick up some better armor than the<br/>\n&gt; tunic your guild gives you. I wore leather armor for a very long time<br/>\n&gt; until I had saved enough to buy something else.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When you do get higher in level and can start buying some better<br/>\n&gt; items, work on buying stuff that is +wis. This will help a lot.<br/>\n&gt; Farther down the road at much higher levels you will want to work on<br/>\n&gt; making your AC and saves better, but you shouldn&#39;t have to worry<br/>\n&gt; about that too much for quite some time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Everyone has different opinions on how to play, but the important<br/>\n&gt; thing is to have fun. Find some people on your server that play in<br/>\n&gt; your area. Usually you&#39;ll start seeing familiar faces.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lyli<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 50 Cleric of Xegony<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dark Reign Order<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Cook Miller-ETOP03<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   To: &#39;EverQuest@y...&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Wednesday, August 08, 2001 1:13 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] New EQ Player<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Rico,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I have a 38 dwarf cleric on The Nameless.  A few tips:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   1) Max wisdom - not all subscribe to this, but you have an inate<br/>\n&gt; strength already as a dwarf.  I put my other points to bring up<br/>\n&gt; either dex or agility, whichever lower<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   2) Find a regular partner to help you to level at the low levels -<br/>\n&gt;  you can solo first few levels, but I found grouping with one other<br/>\n&gt; PC helped<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   3) As a cleric, go to Kurn&#39;s tower around level ten - lots of<br/>\n&gt; undead to nuke on when alone and clerics were always welcome in<br/>\n&gt; groups there<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Use the other yahoogroups specifically for clerics for more help<br/>\n&gt; and advice: EQ_Cleric@y... and EQ-Clerics@y... - Some of the folks<br/>\n&gt; there are quite, er, vocal and opinionated, hehe.  But we all know<br/>\n&gt; that Dwarves make the best clerics - you picked the right race.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Use Caster&#39;s Realm and Rayne&#39;s cleric site for cleric reference<br/>\n&gt; information.  Also Allakhazam&#39;s for a lot of general information.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/\">http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Good luck,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Robiinton<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Dwarf Cleric of 38 Heals<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Piemur Draggonsinger<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Woodelf Bard of 42 Songs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Message: 16<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Unity of Spirits<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   The Nameless<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;      Date: Wed, 08 Aug 2001 01:43:41 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;      From: &quot;Rico&quot; &lt;sage422@h...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: New EQ player<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Hey guys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I know I&#39;m about 2 years late but better late than never.

Beside saving up fo rmy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   spell, I bought the book, should I invest next for my armor?<br/>\n&gt; weapon?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   or misc items such as rings?
