That dot gets his attention, and begins doing <br/>\ndamage. I then begin running away from the Spires, to get some <br/>\ndistance from any possible gnoll back-up. Once I have the distance I <br/>\nwant, I root him and hit him with another dot, Incinerate in this <br/>\ncase. I then rest to regain mana. I will run, root, and dot him until <br/>\ndead. With luck I have enough mana left to rest only a short time <br/>\nbefore I go get another.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was talking with my son-in-law while taking one gnoll, and rooted <br/>\nthe thing at the spire rather than pulling him away. I guess I was <br/>\ndistracted. A second gnoll came along and agroed on me, driving me <br/>\naway. I knew I did not have the mana to manage both, so ran south for <br/>\nLake Raithtear. I reached the zone well ahead of them. I rested to <br/>\nfull capacity, with no gnolls in sight. Didn&#39;t even zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went back to get some more gnolls, but found someone camping the <br/>\nspire I had been working. I started to leave, honoring his claim to <br/>\nan abandoned camp, when a gnoll hit me from behind. I lead him on a <br/>\nfatal chase. The camper sent a tell regarding a perceived violation <br/>\nof camp courtesy, for which I appologized.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that the gnolls will abandon a chase after some time and <br/>\ndistance, but remember you well. The second gnoll I had been involved <br/>\nwith agroed on me from a considerable distance from the Spires. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, gnoll hunters, keep in mind that an injured gnoll has a long <br/>\nmemory, and even longer agro range.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
