Get more +int and +mana<br/>\non<br/>\nyour items, it will help you way more in the long run. And get your<br/>\nfocus<br/>\nitems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Steven R. Hulse] I guess AC was a bad term to use, Mostly I was wanting<br/>\nto know about clothing other than the cheap crap, cloth stuff. I was<br/>\nwondering mostly about leather goods. For example, I found soft wicker<br/>\nlegging in Ak&#39;anon but I&#39;m afraid to buy them because I&#39;ll just waste<br/>\nmoney I can use on other things like spells. I was just hoping for a<br/>\nlittle better protection other than cloth. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks though! ;-)<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 14<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 18 Jul 2002 21:13:29 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;bigmaca3&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmaca3@...\">bigmaca3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Clothing or armor for a Mage<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere a lot of newbie armor quests out there now.  I heard the <br/>\nGnomes armor were going to be in the next patch.  You might check the <br/>\nArcane Order Armor quests in Qeynos, or the similar ones in <br/>\nFreeport.  These all have minor stats on them, but they&#39;re better <br/>\nthan cloth and sometimes even raw silk.  You are well above the level <br/>\nrange for them so they should be easy to get.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n38th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\nTerris-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n[Steven R.

I found the Orcs<br/>\nlove to pick on the little guys! Yesterday I was playing my new warrior<br/>\nGnome and went to Orc hill and man I was even there yet and already had<br/>\n3 of them on my butt! I got creamed but it was fun though!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 15<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 18 Jul 2002 21:15:55 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;bigmaca3&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmaca3@...\">bigmaca3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Magician stuff<br/>\n<br/>\n/help pet will bring up all the pet commands.
