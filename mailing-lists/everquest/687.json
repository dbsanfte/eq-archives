For instance, I see my 1H Blunt going up<br/>\npoint by point on the text box, but can&#39;t see any place that shows<br/>\nwhat point I&#39;m at *now* in all my skills.  I have a friend who says<br/>\nshe&#39;s seen a screen that lists them but can&#39;t remember how to get to<br/>\nit now.  :o/<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I was recently killed by Tovax Vmar.  I was confused at first<br/>\nbut was informed he kills random newbies... Okay, I can live with that<br/>\n(even if my character didn&#39;t &lt;grin&gt;) but before he killed me he &quot;said&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Cannot open file Q2TovaxPL.txt&quot;.  What is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nLori<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
