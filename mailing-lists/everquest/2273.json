I was there and a couple people started namecalling.<br/>\nThen other people got in on it. Then the person who instigated it started<br/>\ntelling people to shut up that he/she didn&#39;t care. and I was thinking, if he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t care why is he bothering to respond? It was just really silly. It<br/>\nlasted a good half hour.<br/>\nDo you want a last name that doesn&#39;t give away your class?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I was checking the list and thought i&#39;d add my two cents to this<br/>\n&gt; subject line :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I play a shaman, i just hit level 18 two nights ago (^_^). Ive paid<br/>\n&gt; for a tp myself, sometimes more than usual to get out of a place i<br/>\n&gt; just cant stand (like yesterday.. i was hunting in Lake of Ill Omen<br/>\n&gt; and someone was doing a raid for their monk epic, and everyone was<br/>\n&gt; shouting and /oocing and even /auctioning and when i asked them to<br/>\n&gt; tone it down to one channel because not everyone in the zone was on<br/>\n&gt; the raid, i was rudely told to shut up and the less i whined the<br/>\n&gt; faster they would be done) or if im despreate and someone&#39;s switched<br/>\n&gt; characters just to port me somewhere.  On the SoW part of the idea, i<br/>\n&gt; think that taking a donation for a sow is all right, like when you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; in the middle of a fight and someone comes up asking for one,  or if<br/>\n&gt; your in a group and really low on mana and someone comes up and wants<br/>\n&gt; one, or when all you hear is &quot;can i have sow?&quot; &lt;cast spell&gt; &quot;ooh!<br/>\n&gt; shes casting sow!!&quot; &lt;the whole durn zone comes running over&gt; &quot;can i<br/>\n&gt; have sow?&quot;  I finally put my character on Roleplay mode (full anon is<br/>\n&gt; not allowed by my guild) so people wouldnt ask me as often.<br/>\n&gt; Occasionally i have the random &quot;you are being inspected&quot; and then i<br/>\n&gt; get asked for it (my weapon is shm only so its kind of a giveaway if<br/>\n&gt; you know my wep), and ill always cast it for corpse runs for people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A slightly different subject now... Can anyone suggest a good surname<br/>\n&gt; for my shammie?  Her name&#39;s Lorecie, at the rate im going i&#39;ll be 20<br/>\n&gt; by the end of the month and i want a surname hehehe.  Also am looking<br/>\n&gt; for suggestions for my fiancee (both in game and real life) for his<br/>\n&gt; characer... so i&#39;ll be taking his surname on soon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions and my random ranting about the jerks in<br/>\n&gt; LoIO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lorecie &lt;Vivix Protectorate&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 18th shaman<br/>\n&gt; Erolissi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., Jeff Gaudry &lt;bgrifter@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to me. Sure, I sometimes get stiffed and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;get something I can&#39;t use as a tip, but for the most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;part I think I have been well rewarded. For me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;it is in character and adds to the game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think i&#39;m coming to the conclusion that a Druid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should less demand payment for a TP, than players<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should feel that the right thing to do is to donate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what they can for one. :) As someone who&#39;s taken quite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a few, I always make sure I have the standard 10pp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; available to offer, it&#39;s just the right thing to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for the investment of time being given for the other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; player. I don&#39;t think i&#39;d stand there once my druid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can group TP and demand payment, but watching that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; twinked level 12 with better equipment than I have go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on about how broke he is might be a little hard to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; swallow.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Web-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
