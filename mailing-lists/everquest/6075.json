I&#39;ve been playing maybe<br/>\nthree days.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am now a level 9 barbarian warrior.  So far I&#39;ve been putting all my<br/>\npoints into 1h slashing.  I have six points that I have no clue where<br/>\nto put.  Any suggestions?  Bash, taunt? Dodge? I&#39;m leaning towards<br/>\nthose, but I want to focus my efforts so that I get the most results<br/>\nfrom my points so I can really use some advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, for some strange reason i&#39;ve been developing blacksmithing.  I&#39;ve<br/>\ngot near 30 points in that.  It&#39;s fun, but seriously...will anything<br/>\nfruitful ever come of this trade skill?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
