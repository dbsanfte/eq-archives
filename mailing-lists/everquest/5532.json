I&#39;m 25 years old married. Both my husband and I<br/>\nplay EQ. He is the one that got me hooked. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Characters:<br/>\nVenetia Valgrave - Lvl 43 Ench High elf - Currently<br/>\ngaining exp to dungeon groups and not liking it<br/>\n<br/>\nClawdya Valgrave Lvl 23 - Beastlord Kitty - Currently<br/>\nin PC<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on the the Tarew Marr server with my husband<br/>\nMorrdak Valgrave who is a lvl 52 Iksar SK. Also a<br/>\nbunch of My RL friends play on that server. We all<br/>\nhave the family name of Valgrave. Its pretty funny.<br/>\nHehe<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to level to 46 as quickly as possible so I<br/>\ncan level in POJ with my friends who are in their 50&#39;s<br/>\nnow. It sucks not being able to level with them. The<br/>\nDungeon groups suck because everybody is sooo rude and<br/>\nI have been jipped out of split 4 times now. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell I just thought I would introduce myself! <br/>\n<br/>\nCary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
