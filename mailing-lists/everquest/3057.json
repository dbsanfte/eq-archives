The \n  drawbacks: Good races<br>won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want to \n  kill you. If you play a<br>darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally \n  suck but you get pretty<br>cool armor when you can manage to find all the \n  stuff you need for it. People<br>don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they think \n  of tanks. They don&#39;t often<br>invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they get the \n  spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br>The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon a pet to \n  tank for you<br>while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, and you get a \n  spell that<br>snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can solo alot and \n  are a good<br>asset to a group. Way later in the game you get to summon your \n  own horse<br>called an Unholy Steed.<br>My brother started a shadowknight and \n  got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br><br>Paladins are welcome in all good cities. \n  Don&#39;t usually have problems selling<br>to merchants. Get good damage, duel \n  wield, disarm. Are thought of as tanks<br>and can get into group. Can also \n  heal and buff. Can even resurrect. But they<br>cannot gate. They can solo \n  pretty well with a good weapon and armor. There<br>are newbie paladin armor \n  quests for humans and halfelves in freeport.<br><br>Druids, not really great \n  tanks but can snare/root and dot from afar. sucks<br>alot of mana. Sometimes \n  they can charm an animal to attack a mob for them.<br>But then the animal \n  turns and attacks them when charm wears off. They can<br>also track, port, and \n  heal.<br><br>If you like things to be more difficult, there&#39;s clerics. They \n  can pretty<br>much get into any group because people always seem to want a \n  healer. But<br>they can&#39;t really solo much and have alot of downtime from \n  medding.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br>&gt; It depends on your playstyle. Solo or \n  group, this will matter a lot later,<br>&gt; the druid you can solo all the \n  way to level60 with if you want and can<br>group<br>&gt; up, but the warrior \n  will have problems crossing the road without getting<br>&gt; killed without a \n  healer back him up. But the warrior is in need in numbers<br>&gt; in the highe \n  end raiding game where the druid is an assist class.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Answer \n  is: it depends on your goals.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -----Original \n  Message-----<br>&gt; From: eclipse4449 [mailto:perrenoud@...]<br>&gt; \n  Sent: Monday, June 17, 2002 4:58 AM<br>&gt; To: \n  EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br>&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] getting \n  started<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I choose to be a Ranger right at the start, \n  maybe a bad choice<br>&gt; because i&#39;m dying more often then playing.<br>&gt; \n  What is the best way to get started, &amp; and which character is a \n  good<br>&gt; newbie character?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Visit the \n  EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  Your use of Yahoo!
