After much exploration I found that my graphics card had \n  <br>crapped out. I thought more trouble was afoot, when my computer <br>seemed \n  to think it was a 256. After reloading a few drivers, I tested <br>the video \n  card again. No video output.<br><br>I was planning on a new card, anyway. We \n  are limping along on the old <br>video out, and I started the disheartening \n  search for a pci card of <br>some value.<br><br>Imagine my elation when I \n  found a gforce4 in pci format for $116!<br><br>Lacking a free $116 right now, \n  I am still limping. But more than I <br>dared hope for is available.<br><br>On \n  the down side, I learned just how much of an EQ junkie I am. I was <br>so \n  depressed by the malfunction that I got drunk. I don&#39;t usually do <br>that. \n  Drank a half pint of Gilby&#39;s vodka and watched dvd&#39;s for a <br>while. Then \n  went to work on the &#39;puter, got it running again, and <br>started \n  shopping.<br><br>Hope to get the new card very soon. Should have my son buy \n  it, as he <br>plays more than I do. His primary is over ten levels ahead of \n  mine.<br><br>Good hunting, everyone.<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
