It is my husband<br/>\n&gt; indeed who kind of made me interested in the game on the internet as<br/>\n&gt; he is very good at it and can play hours (when I say hours I mean<br/>\n&gt; LOTS of hours!!!) in a row!! I saw him playing a straight 24 hours<br/>\n&gt; recently.... :) So hopefully this group will help me understand the<br/>\n&gt; addiction it does create!! :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Danielle<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
