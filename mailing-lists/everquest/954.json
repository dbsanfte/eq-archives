Money will come.  Once you get<br/>\nto your mid 20&#39;s to late 20&#39;s almost everything drops FS weapons and up to 4<br/>\nor 5plat in money as well.  Although I do remember the days when you could<br/>\nkill dwarf NPC in BBM and get an axe that sold for 22p Xg everytime you<br/>\nkilled them.  3 spawns every 12  minutes. 1 person could make over 300pp<br/>\nevery hour.  Not too bad.  They are lvl 35 btw but no longer drop the good<br/>\naxes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great place for money and EXP is Neriak (sp?).  If your around lvl<br/>\n40 or so and can get a group together you wont be disapointed (at 40 you<br/>\nwould need a pretty well rounded group at 50 or so , btw still get exp here<br/>\nat 54 all the guards are still blue, you could do it with 3 or 4 people.  Go<br/>\nin the city and head to 3rd gate zone but dont zone in.  Fight at the zone<br/>\nin and pull from Neriak Commons.  18 spaws here that we could kill in 24<br/>\nminutes.  All of them dropped a sword that our enchanter could sell for 11p<br/>\nand some change, also dropped a shield and usually a second FS weapon.  Have<br/>\nfun know this is a little off the lvl range for what you guys were talking<br/>\nabout but might help someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: IT3 Adam J.
