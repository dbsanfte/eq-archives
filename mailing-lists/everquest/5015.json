Thank you very much! I&#39;ll share this info on my guild board. <br/>\nWould be<br/>\n&gt; fun to do the wars as a guild event.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; To start the quest you should speak to Master Barkem in Shar Vahl <br/>\nat the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; smithing building.  The first part of the quest can be found at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1542\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1542</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; You have to do this quest twice to get 2 carapaces.....then smith <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; carapaces with a tunic mold and nepeta oil, sold by Chialle near <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; bridge<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to shadeweavers, to make the bloodling mail.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hand the tunic to Barkem to get the first hammer. Then you are <br/>\nassigned<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; task of repairing the bridge guard shields.  Ask Barkem [What <br/>\nrepair<br/>\n&gt; order]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get the order, then head to one of the two guards at the end <br/>\nof each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bridge, Shadeweavers and Hollowshade.  Handing them the order <br/>\ngets you<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shield. Take the shield and hammer and combine in a forge to get <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; repaired shield, then hand the shield back to its owner before he<br/>\n&gt; respawns.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he will hand you a letter.  Once you do all 4 guards, the 2 at <br/>\nthe end of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shadeweavers and the 2 at the end of hollowshade, you will then <br/>\nbe given<br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anvil and told to make shadow disks.  To make the disks you <br/>\ncombine 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; swirling shadow with 1 metal bit in a forge with the hammer and <br/>\nanvil.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barkem will hand you a box to put 10 in.  After that, you move on <br/>\nto the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; humming orbs.  Handing Barkem 3 orbs plus your hammer gets you <br/>\nthe hammer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; used to make shadowscream armor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for the substances, that requires running the war of <br/>\nhollowshade.  the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; basics of the war is this.......<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Each camp has a trigger, for the grimling camp in the south its <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; Grimling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Chief, for the wolves east cave its Ghowlik, and for the owlbears <br/>\nits the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; named in back of the caves (was never good at remembering the bear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; names....so oddballed.)  Killing this trigger usually sets off <br/>\nthe enemy<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attack them.  The war moves in one direction...the mobs <br/>\ncontroling the<br/>\n&gt; north<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cave always attacks the south camp, south camp always attacks the <br/>\neast<br/>\n&gt; cave,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and east cave always attacks the north cave.  So to get a mob you <br/>\nwant in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; control of one area, you need to get them to the attacking camp, <br/>\nthen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trigger them to attack the one you want them at.  Once a mob <br/>\ncontrols 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; camps however, if they are attacked they do not spawn defenders <br/>\nin the<br/>\n&gt; camp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; under attack.  The substances you want will drop off the owlbears <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; sonic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wolves once they take the south camp area, rarely they drop off <br/>\nthe others<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but its a once in a 100 kills.  South camp kills are one almost <br/>\nevery<br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill.  The wolves drop Shrieking substances, looks like a blueish <br/>\ngreen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rock, and the owlbears drop wailing substances, looks like an <br/>\norange orb.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Combine 1 each of the substances with the hammer, anvil, one <br/>\nmetal ring,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; water to make the orb, then combine the right number of orbs, <br/>\nswirling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shadows, and mold to make shadowscream armor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The info on the war is also listed at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1609\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1609</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The info on shadowscream armor is at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?\">http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?</a><br/>\narticle=128&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=lchain&menustr=080100120000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Btw...i had heard some trivs near lower 200s, but now see most <br/>\ntrivs in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; higher 200s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
