After much exploration I found that my graphics card had <br/>\ncrapped out. I thought more trouble was afoot, when my computer <br/>\nseemed to think it was a 256. After reloading a few drivers, I tested <br/>\nthe video card again. No video output.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was planning on a new card, anyway. We are limping along on the old <br/>\nvideo out, and I started the disheartening search for a pci card of <br/>\nsome value.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine my elation when I found a gforce4 in pci format for $116!<br/>\n<br/>\nLacking a free $116 right now, I am still limping. But more than I <br/>\ndared hope for is available.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the down side, I learned just how much of an EQ junkie I am. I was <br/>\nso depressed by the malfunction that I got drunk. I don&#39;t usually do <br/>\nthat. Drank a half pint of Gilby&#39;s vodka and watched dvd&#39;s for a <br/>\nwhile. Then went to work on the &#39;puter, got it running again, and <br/>\nstarted shopping.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to get the new card very soon. Should have my son buy it, as he <br/>\nplays more than I do. His primary is over ten levels ahead of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting, everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
