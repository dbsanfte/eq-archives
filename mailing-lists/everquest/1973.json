If your into computers and games<br/>\nin particular you will have to stay slightly ahead of the curve.  Currently<br/>\nyou can pick up memory pretty cheap..  I got mine from googlegear.com.. They<br/>\nhave 512megs of memory for as low as 60$  Keep in mind that only a few years<br/>\nago that could have cost you up to 1$ per meg.  Besides they released the<br/>\nrequirements for Luclin months ago, there was time to upgrade prior.  You<br/>\ncan still certainly play the previous Everquest as well as the prior<br/>\nexpansions without changing much if anything.. If it&#39;s the directx 8<br/>\nproblem, you can pick up compatiable cards (geforce2 MXs) for as low as 35$.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alexander.jones@...\">alexander.jones@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alexander.jones@...\">alexander.jones@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 11, 2001 4:23 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EverQuest] I hate Shadows of Luclin and I don&#39;t even own it<br/>\nyet...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOld puters work just fine. The only problem you have is that your video card<br/>\n*MUST* be dx8 certified. Other than that even going as low as 128 megs will<br/>\nwork. There is not the slightest chance in hell you can install luclin on<br/>\nthat machine tho, cause it will die while trying to render the new graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you should really get more ram, it isnt that expensive. Ram and a nice<br/>\nvideo card and everything works a lot smoother. CPU power isnt that<br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\n512mb for $100 isnt steep. And your machine needs to be nicely configured.<br/>\nFor example if you run WinXP old world eq and me would be like 256 megs to<br/>\nrun ok but on 98 128 works ok and 160 is fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd dont be so negative, SoL is a whopping expansion worth the new specs.<br/>\nGraphics are cool (some char models are a bit weird) but mobs/surrondings<br/>\nare very nice. The mob features are a LOT improved adding more tactics to<br/>\nfights. <br/>\n<br/>\n/Alex<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: den 11 december 2001 10:02<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] I hate Shadows of Luclin and I don&#39;t even own it<br/>\nyet...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly don&#39;t know.<br/>\nI am hoping (as do some of the GMs) that they will make it so that<br/>\nnon-Luclin users can still play without having to upgrade.
