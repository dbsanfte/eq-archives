You <br/>\nget a lot more money when you group.  Sure, you probably don&#39;t get <br/>\neverything for yourself but because the groups can pull fast and <br/>\nkill &#39;em, you generally get more money that way even if you are doing <br/>\nalpha looting.  If you can get into a group, you probably can make <br/>\nmoney that way.  Try the aviaks group in SK.  You can probably do it <br/>\nat 19.  And yeah, Lena&#39;s correct, if you can get a few more levels <br/>\nyou can group in paw or whatever cuz they drop a lot of FS weapons.  <br/>\nThough, killing gnolls can get really boring after a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Denis Baldwin &lt;dbaldwin@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a 19 Warrior and I need more plat.
