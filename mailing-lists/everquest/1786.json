Never used one, don&#39;t know how I should start <br/>\nwith a monk.  Any of you monk amateurs or experts want to give me <br/>\nsome suggestions how I should start my monk on character creation and <br/>\nonward?  That&#39;ll be great.  And for those who are on Druzzil Ro, you <br/>\ncan help me out too because that&#39;s where I&#39;m gonna be making my <br/>\ncharacter.  I don&#39;t know what my character name is gonna be yet but <br/>\nif you guys want to chat, meet me, or help me on druzzil ro, I would <br/>\nlove to know what your character names are.  Now here&#39;s a question, <br/>\nShould I be a human monk or an iksar monk?  I know there are only two <br/>\nraces you can be for a monk.  Anyway, there I am.  Plus the other <br/>\nreason for making this character is to meet somoene who is going to <br/>\nbe married which I met on Vazaelle.  So she asked if I could go to <br/>\nher wedding.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m making this character but since I&#39;m <br/>\ngonna make a character to meet her, might as well use that character <br/>\nin good use.  I was gonna make a new character anyway on a different <br/>\nserver that has better economy than Vazaelle.  Anyway, I would <br/>\nappreciate the help you guys can give me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
