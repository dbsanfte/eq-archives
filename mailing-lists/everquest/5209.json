My main character is a 30th level ranger on<br/>\n&gt; the Tarew Marr server,<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;ve soloing the sarnak fort for the last few<br/>\n&gt; levels (since about<br/>\n&gt; 24th)...so all in all, probably about a month&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; worth of play time for me.<br/>\n&gt; For the most part, the fort has been really quiet.<br/>\n&gt; More often than not, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; the only one fighting there, but over the last few<br/>\n&gt; days, the sarnak fort has<br/>\n&gt; become an extremely popular spot for some reason and<br/>\n&gt; the place is now<br/>\n&gt; overcamped with groups that end up fighting over the<br/>\n&gt; sarnaks that spawn<br/>\n&gt; there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;m trying to figure out where to take my ranger<br/>\n&gt; next for when I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; soloing. When I&#39;m in a group, I have a number of<br/>\n&gt; places to go, but I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; figure out what my next step should be for soloing.<br/>\n&gt; Would anybody care to<br/>\n&gt; share some suggestions, please?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
