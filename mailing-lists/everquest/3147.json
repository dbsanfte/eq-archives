It can be plugged and unplugged while the computer is on, and is easy<br/>\nto install. I think it&#39;s a better solution than a battery powered or<br/>\nrechargeable device.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Anyone else using a wireless mouse? My son installed one on our<br/>\n&gt; computer. I have mixed feelings. When it is good it is very, very<br/>\n&gt; good. When it is bad, it sucks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For the most part, it is nice to be free of wires. This one is radio,<br/>\n&gt; not infra-red. Not bad, until it runs out of juice when you are doing<br/>\n&gt; something important. Don&#39;t forget to put it in it&#39;s docking station<br/>\n&gt; to recharge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t put it in the docking station with care, it calls up a<br/>\n&gt; help window. That is a pain, since the screen saver and monitor shut<br/>\n&gt; off don&#39;t seem to want to work while the help window is open. A<br/>\n&gt; little care prevents this, but what a pain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The up side is that you can re-arrange your gaming hardware<br/>\n&gt; configuration to suit your tastes without worrying about the mouse<br/>\n&gt; cable. This wireless stuff may be rather nice once the bugs are<br/>\n&gt; worked out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
