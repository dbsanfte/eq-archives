Here<br/>\n&gt; is what I would try:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. uninstall everything associated with the game<br/>\n&gt; including Direct X., REBOOT,<br/>\n&gt; 2.

Install EQ BUT BUT BUT, when you install it this<br/>\n&gt; time, change the directory to something like c:&#92;EQ and<br/>\n&gt; not the default.<br/>\n&gt; 5. after installing eq reboot and try again ti run<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; NOTES: if it still does not work, make sure your<br/>\n&gt; software firewall is not running, make sure you are<br/>\n&gt; not running TOO high of a resolution for your monitor.<br/>\n&gt; Most important, try shutting down any application<br/>\n&gt; running in the background you do not need, even<br/>\n&gt; disable antivirus software just as a test.

I have cookies <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enabled, I&#39;m signed in and it says &quot;hi muddywag&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at the top, but it <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; keeps telling me that I need to be registered. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; AHHH! IWANNA KILL A <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BAT!!  By the way I CAN play the tutorial.  Which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only served to let <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me know that I&#39;ll REALLY like this game- someday!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can&#39;t post to the tech boards because you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have an EQ account <br/>\n&gt; &gt; yet.  Until you finish the registration screens in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the game your station <br/>\n&gt; &gt; name and password isn&#39;t associated with an EQ<br/>\n&gt; &gt; account.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do yourself a favor and delete that tutorial.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s the one you <br/>\n&gt; &gt; download off the station&#39;s website, it&#39;s very old. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It does give an idea <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of gameplay but you&#39;ll still be very lost when you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play for the first <br/>\n&gt; &gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; First thing you do when you do get a character<br/>\n&gt; &gt; started is change where <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the autoattack key is.  Every newbie gets killed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trying to talk to thier <br/>\n&gt; &gt; trainer because they don&#39;t hit enter before they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start to type<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You click Options then Keyboard then click the field<br/>\n&gt; &gt; below Autoattack <br/>\n&gt; &gt; then hit a key on the keyboard you don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll use often.  Mine <br/>\n&gt; &gt; is set to Q, some people use the Insert key.  Dont<br/>\n&gt; &gt; use the numbers, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything on the number pad, Pgup, Pgdown, or any of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Fkeys or arrow <br/>\n&gt; &gt; key; all those have a use already in the game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Good luck<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bebinn Maolcataig<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 24 Woodelf Druid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dignatio cum Demori guild, Bertoxxulous server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Sign up for SBC Yahoo!
