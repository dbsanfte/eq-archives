I&#39;ve found that killing <br/>\nBandits and Raiders in NK helps with the bad guard faction.  I have a <br/>\nfriend who is running a Half-elf Rogue and he keeps close track of <br/>\nhis faction.  He can go anywhere!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd back on topic, give him the teeth 4 at a time, and make sure you <br/>\nhave slots open.  And you do know about that second part of the quest?<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n36th Ranger of Tunare<br/>\nTerris-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
