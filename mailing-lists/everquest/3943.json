I was reading the posts on the Beta website<br/>\nand the oldest person is 64, (so far), so all ages enjoy the game. Hope you<br/>\nare wrong about people not playing because of difficulty getting hooked up.<br/>\nCan you buy the network adapter online? I haven&#39;t started yet. When they<br/>\nsend the disks I&#39;ll get the adapter but I&#39;m wondering if it will be hard to<br/>\nfind here in Hawaii. If they were smart they would make sure places like<br/>\nWal-Mart had em.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee ya in the game!<br/>\nSteve<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPolitics is the show business of industry.  --Frank Zappa<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Steven R.

I got into it also, I&#39;m really<br/>\n&gt; excited!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well I don&#39;t know about it being a &quot;kid&#39;s platform&quot; I&#39;m 33 and think<br/>\n&gt; it will do great on the PS2. The only thing I think there might be<br/>\n&gt; issues with regarding it&#39;s survival is the whol PS2 online part. I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know if there will be too many people that will get the adapter<br/>\n&gt; or allow their kids to go online with it. Didn&#39;t Nintendo or another<br/>\n&gt; gaming console maker try that a few years back but it failed?<br/>\n&gt; Personally there were times I wish I had EQ for my PS2 simply to free<br/>\n&gt; up my PC for other things. Like I can play EQ all day and the wife<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t have to yell at me to get off the PC so she can use it! LOL<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You said a regular USB keyboard will work on the PS2? Thats cool, I<br/>\n&gt; have one so now I won&#39;t have to go buy the PS2 specific one. You know<br/>\n&gt; what would be great, if you could use those little USB storage<br/>\n&gt; devices to save info on! God that would rock!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW since your also in the Beta, you can PM me anytime and we can<br/>\n&gt; chat about the game. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
