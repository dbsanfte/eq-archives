From experience, I did notice a slight increase in the<br/>\ntime it took to zone when I upgraded my AMD athlon 600 from 64 megs to 192<br/>\nmegs.  Of course, 64 was a little under powered anyway so I might have just<br/>\nbrought it up to normal speed...<br/>\n<br/>\nMackmillan<br/>\n11th lvl Barb Shaman<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
