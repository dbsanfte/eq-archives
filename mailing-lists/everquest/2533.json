But both<br/>\ncomputers are easily playable for 2 group situation encounters. You really<br/>\nneed to tune your computer so it will run EQ and SoL the best for your<br/>\ncomputer. Verant has some many options now that help cut down on lag. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one EQ ini.client program that will help you set all your defaults<br/>\nto maximize your performance. The web site is<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uncon.com/reverend/eqiniedit/\">http://www.uncon.com/reverend/eqiniedit/</a> The owner of this program really<br/>\nstays on top of patches too. He already has a /hitsmode option to help set<br/>\nyou the way you want it. Although, I still not that happy with the /hitsmode<br/>\noptions, but it is a step in the right direction. What I want is another<br/>\nwindow, that I can resize that has ALL combat chat in it. Right now, I still<br/>\nsee my damage shield message, Taunt message and Disarm message. I think<br/>\nVerant is really working hard to get all these nice features into the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in your ini client file, you can turn off dynamic lighting, on server<br/>\nside filter, on/off armor texture, Texture Quality, Each character module on<br/>\nor off and many tracking options. One of the best fixes for SoL on my second<br/>\ncomputer was the use of Umbra. This really helped my zone times in the old<br/>\nworld and overall lag in all zones.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry it out, go to the message board and ask for features. I really like this<br/>\nprogram and first used it to get my chat colors just the right color.<br/>\n<br/>\nSistily - 60 Warrior  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tJerry M.
