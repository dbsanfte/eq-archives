I hope you will have a good time and <br/>\nenjoy the game along with trying to figure out why hubby is addicted! <br/>\nLOL Actually I like to think of the &quot;addiction&quot; caused by EQ is one like <br/>\nan &quot;on-going vacation&quot; It&#39;s always something new, challenging, the <br/>\npossibilities are almost endless. There are so many places to go and <br/>\nsee, and real people to meet and not just computer created people <br/>\nalthough there are those too, (called NPC&#39;s) that you do need to talk <br/>\nto. You can meet others from all over the world from the safety and <br/>\ncomfort of your house. Plus the growth and development of your character <br/>\n  is like watching a child grow. Before you know it, you&#39;ll be addicted!<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy adventureing!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 1         <br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 28 Aug 2004 23:45:35 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;danielleheier&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danielleheier@...\">danielleheier@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: New<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m Danielle and I&#39;m quite new with EverQuest. It is my husband <br/>\n&gt; indeed who kind of made me interested in the game on the internet as <br/>\n&gt; he is very good at it and can play hours (when I say hours I mean <br/>\n&gt; LOTS of hours!!!) in a row!! I saw him playing a straight 24 hours <br/>\n&gt; recently.... :) So hopefully this group will help me understand the <br/>\n&gt; addiction it does create!! :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Danielle<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
