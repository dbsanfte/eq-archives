Everquest is an old game, using<br/>\nolder code, and some of that code has been modified to<br/>\ntry and make the game graphics look like some of the<br/>\nnewer games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not blaming them, they&#39;re just trying to keep up<br/>\nwith what the players want (better looking graphics).<br/>\nIt&#39;s just that the original graphic engine is too old.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n3 gigs of RAM and a 3 gig processor... wow, I&#39;d love<br/>\nto have that, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.  I think at some point there will be a massive overhaul of the<br/>\ngraphics in these zones that lag and change the code so it&#39;s more up to<br/>\ndate.  Moving to the XML GUI I think helped a lot, except now there is more<br/>\nof the screen to refresh.So when they can fix that, the Bazaar will be so<br/>\nmuch more bearable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we&#39;d all love to have 3 gigs of RAM and a 3 gig processor!  I know I<br/>\nwould.  Maybe Santa will bring me one for Christmas!<br/>\n<br/>\nWulfric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
