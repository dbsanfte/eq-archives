Some are on upper floors,<br/>\n&gt; seldom visited. I usually only do this when there are not a lot of<br/>\n&gt; people on, to reduce the probability of someone picking up my drop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I get my twinker and twinkie in the same place, make the drop, log<br/>\n&gt; twinker off, log twinkie on, make the pick up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For the most part I keep this in a rp mode by having twinkie and<br/>\n&gt; twinker be cousins, one passing to the other such things as relatives<br/>\n&gt; might to help each other out. No super-twinks. A bit of a push, but<br/>\n&gt; it works for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My primary and first alt are from Rivervale, and I found a few good<br/>\n&gt; twink spots there as well. However, one of them I moved to Freeport<br/>\n&gt; and had bound there, so my higher level character visits him in<br/>\n&gt; Freeport from time to time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., D M &lt;sailorecko@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how do you make a twinkie? what ways are there?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yes I suck<br/>\n&gt; &gt; === message truncated ===<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Send your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.com\">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
