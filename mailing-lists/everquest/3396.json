I personally<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been there yet. I was told you need the Luclin expansion for it.<br/>\nDon&#39;t have that one, heck I just picked up the Ruins expan yesterday!<br/>\nLol!<br/>\nI have to admit I personally am enjoying the little amount of people in<br/>\nthe game, I&#39;m getting a hold of a lot of great stuff and making some<br/>\ndecent plat amounts. I&#39;ve been able to get all the items I need for my<br/>\nquests and so forth. Today I was surprised and happy to see a few people<br/>\nrunning around in Steamfront. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway back to my quests!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 5<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 28 Jul 2002 11:11:03 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Lag at the Bazaar<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone has said this was Verant&#39;s fault. I think we all<br/>\nrealize that anytime you have a large number of people someplace it is<br/>\ngoing<br/>\nto zone. It is kindof amazing to realize that there are 200+ people in<br/>\none<br/>\nzone though. I don&#39;t think people expected to see that many in one zone.<br/>\nHopefully the lag will die down some as the novelty of the new features<br/>\nstart to fade. Who knows though, maybe they might have to make a<br/>\nbazaar2.<br/>\nUntil then, some of us with really pathetic &#39;net connections will have<br/>\nto<br/>\nwait until the fervor dies down.<br/>\nAnd nah. You&#39;re not going to get flamed. You&#39;re just stating the facts.<br/>\n:-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
