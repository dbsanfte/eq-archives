The problem was that I couldn&#39;t even get <br/>\nto a point where I could run the system restore option. <br/>\nAs I start up the first thing I see is the Dell splash <br/>\nscreen then it would proceed into booting up windows. <br/>\nWell it would get passed the Dell screen and then <br/>\nimmediately go to a white screen telling me it couldn&#39;t <br/>\nfind any drives. Usually one can boot off a floppy or <br/>\nCDRom, I couldn&#39;t even do that! Being a laptop and the <br/>\ndrives are interchangeable, I wasn&#39;t even getting power <br/>\nto the other drives. I was figuring something went wrong <br/>\nwith the SCSI management on a hardware basis and that <br/>\nthe only repair option was to send it in. I hadn&#39;t <br/>\ncontacted Dell yet, I was mostly venting and throwing a <br/>\nfit. ;-) When I went to Dell&#39;s site to chat with support <br/>\nthe stupid thing started working again and has been fine <br/>\never since. I uninstalled SP3 though!<br/>\nMy level is pretty good, thanks for the consideration, <br/>\nnot to many people are that way anymore. I&#39;m getting <br/>\nready to test on my Win2k MCSE so wish me luck! <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\nSteve</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
