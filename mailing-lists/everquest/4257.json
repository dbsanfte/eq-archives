It was cause by my screen resolution <br/>\nbeing 32 bits when my game resolution was set to 16 bits. <br/>\nYou can set the graphics resolution once your in the game, but to get <br/>\nin the game try setting your display to 16 bits, 32 bits etc until <br/>\none works. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that solves your problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWes</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
