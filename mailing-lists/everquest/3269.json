It happens.  People don&#39;t <br/>\nrealize that if they unload that big damage DD or DoT or heal for too <br/>\nmuch too soon the mob is going to head straight for them.  It can be <br/>\nhard to hold aggro on a mob when that happens.  My Ranger has had to <br/>\nbecome good at peeling the mobs off the casters just to keep them <br/>\nalive.  They&#39;ll never make it if they run!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen and been involved in total party wipeouts, and they are <br/>\nno fun!  I&#39;d rather the Cleric survive it, maybe we&#39;ll get a Rez?<br/>\n<br/>\nI play a Cleric from time to time as well.  He fights to the death <br/>\nand beyond!  So he has a melee mentality!<br/>\n<br/>\nTul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
