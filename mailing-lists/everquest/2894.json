Very weird person. \n<div></div>&gt;luv, \n<div></div>&gt;-Su \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Hi, \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; ROFLOL at Rob. Yeah EC definitely!!!! \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; I&#39;m female and I play female characters. The only way I&#39;d consider \n<div></div>&gt;playing \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; a male character is if their stats were better. But, since EQ is an equal \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; opportunity creator, meaning men and women share the same stats, it&#39;s not \n<div></div>&gt;an \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; issue. \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Now, I do notice that when I&#39;m playing with my 22 year old son and his \n<div></div>&gt;male \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; character I get a few more buffs than him but not often. \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Maybe men play female characters because they think it will help them \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; understand women better. LOL just joking! \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Anyway, I love the game and I don&#39;t care whether your male or female just \n<div></div>&gt;as \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; long as you enjoy the game! \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Kanalyn 17 Druid \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Analyn 9 Beastlord \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Allilee 9 Ranger \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Maralexis 9 Wizard \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Tarew Marr \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Anelalyn 7 Cleric \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Karana \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
