I finally did it!<br/>\n&gt; I failed a combine a couple times and lost two runed sea shells <br/>\n(which were<br/>\n&gt; the most expensive thing I had to buy for it-- I tried hunting in <br/>\nSG but<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have any luck). I got my JC to 173, my tailoring to 176, <br/>\nfletching to<br/>\n&gt; 180, brewing to 184, pottery to 154, and smithing to 112. I got <br/>\nimpatient on<br/>\n&gt; the pottery and just asked someone to put the water and the velium <br/>\npowder<br/>\n&gt; (made from the runed sea shell and a small brick of velium in a <br/>\nmortar and<br/>\n&gt; pestle-- no fail combine) in a pottery wheel and got my Unfired <br/>\nRune. I<br/>\n&gt; fired the rune. I bought a geerlok gemsetter. Borrowed a geerlok <br/>\nplaning<br/>\n&gt; tool for my fletching for the combines. and borrowed a geerlok <br/>\nsewing kit<br/>\n&gt; for the final combine. Had C3 on and success!!<br/>\n&gt; I now have my Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl!<br/>\n&gt; Now I need to work on JC and Smithing some more for my 8th shawl...<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt; Version: 6.0.544 / Virus Database: 338 - Release Date: 11/25/2003 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
