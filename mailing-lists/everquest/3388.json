Find a spot on one of the trading <br/>\nplatforms. You cannot trade if you are not on a platform. Type /trade<br/>\nand set your prices. Hit List Items so others can scan the list. Now <br/>\neither sit there and chat or afk and do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sold for an hour, but no buyers. Then I scanned the shopping list <br/>\nand found a hq brute hide for 5pp. Seemed a good deal, so I bought <br/>\nit, banked, and logged.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a fabulous setup once you get it set up. Find a spot on the <br/>\nplatform and your toon can sell all day while you work or sleep. Just <br/>\nthe thing when you actually want to eat in real life. A real meal, I <br/>\nmean, not just gamer food.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Heh.<br/>\n&gt; How do you set up to sell in the bazaar anyways?<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Went there this morning to set up some sales. Lag was terrible. It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was hard to even get my cursor on target. I suppose it will be ok<br/>\n&gt; &gt; once I get set up to sell, but the set up is terrible. Move <br/>\ncursor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not on object. Move a bit more. Not on object. Move back. Click.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t have object. Click again. Hmph. Had object but didn&#39;t know <br/>\nit,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and just put it back. Click...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Took so long that I didn&#39;t finish setting up before I had to log. <br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t have logged if I could have left my toon to do business<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while I was gone, but no such luck.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just gotta get another machine, faster connection, and retire <br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my job so that I can play all the time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
