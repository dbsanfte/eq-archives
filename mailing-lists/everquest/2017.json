These<br/>\ndirectx7 / win95 customers are not supporting Verant by buying SoL and any<br/>\nother expansions or games that could come out in the future.

But to some other<br/>\npeople that&#39;s<br/>\n\ta hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a<br/>\nrent-to-own<br/>\n\tbasis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s easy to say<br/>\nthey<br/>\n\tshould quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an escape for them. To<br/>\nsuddenly<br/>\n\tnot be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way<br/>\nVerant<br/>\n\tcould work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so<br/>\nfinancially<br/>\n\tstable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if nothing else.<br/>\n\tBtw, someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap? Where was<br/>\nthat<br/>\n\tagain?
