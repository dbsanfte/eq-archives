I&#39;ve seen Druids, Wizards,<br/>\nShadow Knights, Paladins, Rangers, Bards, Enchanters and even Clerics solo<br/>\nat 60, some are just more effective than others. With all the new AA skills,<br/>\narmor, spells and Flowing Thought items that now all stack on top of each<br/>\nother, soloing is not that hard at level 60. Some are more effective than<br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Shamans can solo just about as good as any other class. From level 1<br/>\nto 60, some classes will do some levels faster than others. As long as you<br/>\nhave the right gear and spells. No class can get the higher end gear to solo<br/>\nat level 60 unless they buy it with plat and MQ some of the armor quests. No<br/>\nepic can be obtained unless they group, some epic pieces can be solo&#39;d, but<br/>\nno class can get their end epic weapon 100% solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to pick 1 class to just solo from 1 to 60, I&#39;d pick either a shaman<br/>\nor druid and I&#39;ve played both classes at level 60. The Shaman class would be<br/>\nmore valuable at level 60 imo, but the Druid would level faster. <br/>\n<br/>\nSistily<br/>\n60 Warlord<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tHanna Clutterbuck [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karra42@...\">karra42@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tThursday, January 17, 2002 10:41 AM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\tRe: [EverQuest] Best soloing class<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t--- Emily Bembeneck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ebembeneck@...\">ebembeneck@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; I am just wondering your thoughts on which class<br/>\n\t&gt; makes for the best soloing.. all the way from 1-60..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tI&#39;m told that the only class that can effectively solo<br/>\n\t1-60 is druids.
