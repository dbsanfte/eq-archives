BAH!!! Listen to the REAL news like CNN and <br/>\nstuff, don&#39;t listen to 48 hours or talk shows, they only want <br/>\nratings, tell your Parents that if they got a problem with EQ talk to <br/>\nme I&#39;ll knock some sense into them! I&#39;ve been playing for 2 years, my <br/>\ncousin&#39;s been playing since it game out along with his friends and <br/>\nthey&#39;re fine. yeah There are obsessed people out there but that&#39;s for <br/>\nall the games not just EQ. I mean there are stalkers out there also. <br/>\njeezuz, and if they talk to me about the game tell them to email me <br/>\nor shut up about giveing you crap about EQ. Same goes for anyone else <br/>\nwho has this problem, tell your parents to get over it, if they KNOW <br/>\nyou and they should, then there is no problems unless you&#39;ve done <br/>\nthat kind of stupid stuff before (suicide), I mean as you all <br/>\nprobally heard about EQ that guy who commited suicide had a mentel <br/>\ncondition, hopefully none of you have that problem, and if you do, <br/>\njust be safe ^_^. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Thunder Cat&quot; &lt;Thunder_Cat_4283@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone heard the news lately about EverQuest?

They also said people become obsessed and make the game their <br/>\n&gt; life...they don&#39;t get jobs or do anything else, just play all the <br/>\ntime. My <br/>\n&gt; parents are now concerned and told me as soon as they see any signs <br/>\nthat I <br/>\n&gt; am going to kill myself, they are taking the game away. I can&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve <br/>\n&gt; that...the game is fun, yeah, but to end your life over it?
