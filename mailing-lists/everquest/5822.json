For the few who might of known me..well I am back.<br/>\nFor those who don&#39;t remember here is a little story on how I got into this<br/>\ngroup.  Last year I was in the gulf for 9 months with no EQ (only thing that<br/>\nkept me sane was my collection of EQ guides) and I managed to have a buddy<br/>\nof mine register this email address with Yahoo Groups..so while I was at sea<br/>\nI could still keep up with the latest EQ news.  When I came back mid Nov. I<br/>\nwas amazed at all the changes the game has been thru (before I left I just<br/>\nhad downloaded LoY) now I&#39;m upto date with all the expansions.  So anyway<br/>\nhere is a little info about me:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been playing EQ now since June of 02 (a buddy of mine got me started)<br/>\nand have been addicted ever since.  I spent the majority of my time making<br/>\nall kinds of characters, deleting them, making more, deleting<br/>\nthose..etc.,just to see how each class is like.  Well I have finally managed<br/>\nto stick with a class I like which is my main 53 DE SK..3 more AAs and I get<br/>\na title heh.  I play on the Ayonae Ro server (with a couple old alts on<br/>\nTunare) and I am a member of the Caelitus guild and have been for about 5<br/>\n1/2 months now.  Here is a list of all my..mains.<br/>\n<br/>\nAyonae Ro Server<br/>\nBloodbrood Deathdisciple 53 dark elf sk<br/>\nShruiken Tranquilfist 35 human monk<br/>\nRaptersaur Reptilianclaw 30 iksar bst<br/>\nBloodlich 25 dark elf necro<br/>\nCleptocat Thiefofthenight 24 vah shir rogue<br/>\nSteelbow 12 wood elf ranger<br/>\nHackx 10 vah shir zerker<br/>\nCruifixx 7 froglock pally<br/>\nSpeakerbox 6 half-elf bard<br/>\n<br/>\nTunare Server<br/>\nDabruiser 35 troll war<br/>\nXatrok Hellraiser 26 iksar necro (retired)<br/>\nShrubwacker 5 human druid (still has KEI back when anyone could get it)<br/>\nMisticmind 5 eurodite wizzy (also with KEI)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I better end this before it gets too long, later all and Happy Hunting!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
