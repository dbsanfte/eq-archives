That&#39;s why I said get a port to DL and run to FM. :-)<br/>\nJust get sow and levitate-- maybe invis/camo and run like hell. That&#39;s what<br/>\nI do. :-)<br/>\nOh yeah, I forgot there were brutes in FM.. But there are some relatively<br/>\nsafe spots in DL near KC.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The fix is in. They haven&#39;t gotten the boats running, and the<br/>\n&gt; shuttles just sit at the dock. However, on the dock is a temporary<br/>\n&gt; NPC who will translocate you to Timorous Deep. The one in TD will<br/>\n&gt; send you either way. I went to FV and set my bind point, but then<br/>\n&gt; returned to SK to finish my goals of gathering a full toolbox of<br/>\n&gt; Plains Pebbles and completing level 32. Dinged 33 last night, went to<br/>\n&gt; Rivervale to put my things in order, and put my toon to bed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Su, I am not sure that a level 33 hanging around KC in DL is a very<br/>\n&gt; survivable idea. I am more inclined to Frontier Mountains.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tend to approach the game in a semi-role-playing way. The game<br/>\n&gt; allows us to go boldly almost anywhere, as death is no very big deal.<br/>\n&gt; I prefer avoid game death, planning my moves with care and setting<br/>\n&gt; incremental goals. I think Frontier Mountains is a good step.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will keep in mind your advice, however. As I level up I will still<br/>\n&gt; need those Brute hides, and the KC hunting experience will be a good<br/>\n&gt; later step.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
