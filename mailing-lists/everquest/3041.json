The drawbacks: Good races<br/>\nwon&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want to kill you. If you play a<br/>\ndarkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally suck but you get pretty<br/>\ncool armor when you can manage to find all the stuff you need for it. People<br/>\ndon&#39;t think of shadowknights when they think of tanks. They don&#39;t often<br/>\ninvite them to group. I don&#39;t think they get the spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br/>\nThe bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon a pet to tank for you<br/>\nwhile you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, and you get a spell that<br/>\nsnares and dots a mob at the same time. You can solo alot and are a good<br/>\nasset to a group. Way later in the game you get to summon your own horse<br/>\ncalled an Unholy Steed.<br/>\nMy brother started a shadowknight and got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins are welcome in all good cities. Don&#39;t usually have problems selling<br/>\nto merchants. Get good damage, duel wield, disarm. Are thought of as tanks<br/>\nand can get into group. Can also heal and buff. Can even resurrect. But they<br/>\ncannot gate. They can solo pretty well with a good weapon and armor. There<br/>\nare newbie paladin armor quests for humans and halfelves in freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids, not really great tanks but can snare/root and dot from afar. sucks<br/>\nalot of mana. Sometimes they can charm an animal to attack a mob for them.<br/>\nBut then the animal turns and attacks them when charm wears off. They can<br/>\nalso track, port, and heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you like things to be more difficult, there&#39;s clerics. They can pretty<br/>\nmuch get into any group because people always seem to want a healer. But<br/>\nthey can&#39;t really solo much and have alot of downtime from medding.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It depends on your playstyle. Solo or group, this will matter a lot later,<br/>\n&gt; the druid you can solo all the way to level60 with if you want and can<br/>\n </span></blockquote>group<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; up, but the warrior will have problems crossing the road without getting<br/>\n&gt; killed without a healer back him up. But the warrior is in need in numbers<br/>\n&gt; in the highe end raiding game where the druid is an assist class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Answer is: it depends on your goals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: eclipse4449 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:perrenoud@...\">perrenoud@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 17, 2002 4:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] getting started<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I choose to be a Ranger right at the start, maybe a bad choice<br/>\n&gt; because i&#39;m dying more often then playing.<br/>\n&gt; What is the best way to get started, & and which character is a good<br/>\n&gt; newbie character?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
