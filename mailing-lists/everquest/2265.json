I am convinced that<br/>\n&gt;such good will comes back. A gift, a hand, good<br/>\n&gt;advice. I cannot always afford to cross zones to do<br/>\n&gt;so, but when I can I like to sow and buff.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, that sums up what i&#39;ve been referring to as<br/>\n&quot;adding to the good karma pool&quot;, every time I SoW<br/>\nsomeone and brighten their day, when they&#39;re playing<br/>\ntheir alt Druid or Shaman, they&#39;re just a little more<br/>\nlikely to do the same for me. As for the last line<br/>\nthough, that&#39;s where I draw a personal line. You want<br/>\nSoW, sure thing, absolutely happy to help, but you<br/>\ncome to me. Sometimes people decide it&#39;s not worth it<br/>\nin large zones like LOIO, others they don&#39;t mind, but<br/>\nmost of the time either way people understand. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I like to do though is randomly hunt<br/>\npeople down and SoW them without any warning, then run<br/>\noff before they can figure out where I am. ;) You know<br/>\nyou&#39;re running thru LOIO on your way to FV or<br/>\nsomething and you see a guy in combat, swing near him<br/>\nand SoW &#39;em, never once had a complaint and<br/>\naccidentally saved a few lives that way. :) It&#39;s the<br/>\nsame deal in less combat intensive zones, running thru<br/>\nGFay when you blow past that guy on the path cause<br/>\nhe&#39;s running normal speed, give him a boost. I know<br/>\nwhat a boring run that is at normal from my rogue. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now that I can port, I have decided to do so without<br/>\n&gt;thought of reward. Oh, of course I will go quite a<br/>\n&gt;bit out of my way for an offer of good money, but I<br/>\n&gt;have found giving a port to someone unable to give<br/>\n&gt;much in return seems to add to the game in other ways<br/>\n&gt;than money. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m still pondering exactly how I feel about group<br/>\nports. I don&#39;t think I could ever feel right about<br/>\nrunning around auctioning &quot;Porting to NK, BB, SF, Tox<br/>\nand WC for 50pp per seat&quot;, but I do personally think<br/>\nthat a small donation is the right thing when<br/>\nrecieving a port. (not that i&#39;d ever actively demand<br/>\none) As someone who&#39;s probably spent a couple hundred<br/>\nplat on ports over the last while, I just see the<br/>\nstandard 10pp donation is a small way of saying<br/>\n&quot;thanks for your time&quot;. Again, not required, but a<br/>\nnice gesture. It&#39;s most certainly a larger commitment<br/>\nthan SoW... (I still can&#39;t feel right about taking<br/>\ndonations for a SoW though, the guy with the HQ Bear<br/>\nPelt was rather persistant, but I usually stubbornly<br/>\nrefuse &#39;em :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nWeb-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
