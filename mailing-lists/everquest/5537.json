Now someone has thrown me another mystery to<br/>\nsolve. A<br/>\n&gt; player sent me the following words:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Link your wep pls?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Ok. I figured out that a wep is a weapon. When I asked him what he<br/>\nmeant,<br/>\n&gt; he said that he wanted to link with my hammer. I have an Intel&#39;s<br/>\nHammer.<br/>\n&gt; However, I have no idea what he means by linking him to it or how to<br/>\ndo it.<br/>\n&gt; Somebody please throw this poor newbe a clue. G. I&#39;m playing a level<br/>\n24 vah<br/>\n&gt; shir shaman. Great goddess, there is something totally new to learn<br/>\n&gt; everything I log on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you hold down the ALT key while clicking on an item it will open up a<br/>\npersistent window describing its stats. If you then click on the icon of<br/>\nthe item that appears in this window (the top right corner of the<br/>\nwindow), it will paste a hot-link with the name of the item into your<br/>\nchat bar at the current cursor location. You can use this procedure to<br/>\npass a hot-link to other people, who can then click on the link (the<br/>\nname of the item) on their screen, which will then open up the items<br/>\ndescription window on their computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can have up to 4 item windows open at once, subsequent items will<br/>\nreplace the contents of the 4th window opened.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will often notice item names appearing in different colour to the<br/>\nsurrounding text as you play (they updated the loot message to use these<br/>\nhotlinks too). If you click on the highlighted text you will see the<br/>\nitem window, with all the stats for that item.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.568 / Virus Database: 359 - Release Date: 26/01/2004 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
