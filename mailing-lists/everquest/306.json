Woodelves have the<br/>\n&gt;born-with-skill to Hide.  However, when I was watching them play with<br/>\n&gt;Hide (they were lvl4-6), I could still see them.  On their screen they were<br/>\n&gt;hidden and they can nolonger see their character, but I can see them plainly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Once in awhile I see them disappear, but most of the time I still see them<br/>\n&gt;even though they said they got the message &quot;you are hidden&quot; and they can<br/>\n&gt;no longer see themselves in any camera view.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Is this a bug, are they doing something wrong, or do Humans have a chance<br/>\n&gt;of seeing them even though they are hidden from other eyes?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; //Aldaren the Human, woodelf spotting, cleric <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Are you?
