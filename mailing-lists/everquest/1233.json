Even if I&#39;m already in a group I get people<br/>\nsending me tells asking for a heal or a bind. They&#39;ll expect me to leave my<br/>\ngroup and go find them to bind or heal. but most people are polite about it.<br/>\nIf I ask for clarity or breeze I generally offer to donate or pay for said<br/>\nservice. Or I offer to return a buff if my buffs are good enough.<br/>\nI mostly have people outside my group being polite. but when I have people<br/>\nin my group they can be rather rude. Like I was grouped with his one kid<br/>\n(who I later found out was only 9 yrs old) who kept saying &quot;Heal me. HEAL<br/>\nME!&quot; when he wasn&#39;t even halfway down and I&#39;d already told him I was out of<br/>\nmana. I had said to other people I swore he was only 10. but then his father<br/>\ntold me he was 9.<br/>\nPersonally I don&#39;t think kids that age should play EQ. Especially when they<br/>\ncould potentially screw things up for other people&#39;s characters.<br/>\ngo figure.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; /lfg on<br/>\n&gt; /ooc 55 Enchanter looking for group or partner<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In comes about 5 or 6 tells asking for clarity haste ect ect.
