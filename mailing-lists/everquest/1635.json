One guy in particular. He kept looting<br/>\nwhile we were still fighting. I told him to stop it. (with my female alt).<br/>\nHe tried to claim he had only looted once corpse but I watched him loot 3 in<br/>\na row. I told him to stop looting and let others have a chance. Still he<br/>\nkept hogging loot. We killed a Lego. He sat back and didn&#39;t do much while we<br/>\nkilled it but he ran up and looted. He looted a bronze weapon. I said I<br/>\nwanted to roll for it. Everyone rolled, I got the highest roll. Not only did<br/>\nhe not roll, but he refused to give the brozne weapon up. So he got df<br/>\nshoulderpads AND the bronze weapon. Finally, we killed the orc weaponsmith.<br/>\nI said his name and &quot;Do NOT loot the weaponsmith&quot;. He looted it. I<br/>\nimmediately disbanded him. He stood around for awhile and didn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nrealize he wasn&#39;t in group until he tried to loot something. Then he asked<br/>\nto be allowed back into group. I said &quot;no&quot;. I think he was shocked that a<br/>\nfemale character was so &quot;harsh&quot;. I only wish I had disbanded him before he<br/>\ncould loot the Lego.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t have any male characters.
