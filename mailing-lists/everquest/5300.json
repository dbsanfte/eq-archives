The <br/>\nclosest zone was thurgadin and i had to pray to cazic-thule that the <br/>\ncoldain didn&#39;t hate Iksar Necromancers.<br/>\nI had heard about a wedding being held earlier and i remembered that <br/>\nit was at the waterfall by thurgadin so i shouted train to thurgadin <br/>\nand remembered that i could FD so i did to make sure that i wasn&#39;t <br/>\nkilled and that the wurms did&#39;t spoil the wedding.  Luckily i was far <br/>\nenough from the wedding that the wurms ran back to their caves.<br/>\nHeres where it stars...  First of all the wedding was in OOC.  Bad <br/>\nchoice.  Second the peeps of the wedding kept telling people in the <br/>\nzone to &quot;Shutup&quot; or &quot;Stfu&quot;  That was being rude.  I proceeded to tell <br/>\nthem that they should hold a wedding in SAY or a seperate channel.  <br/>\nThey all got pissed at me and everyone there kept vowing revenge on <br/>\nme.  Made me a bit mad but i held it in so that i didn&#39;t purposefully <br/>\ngive them a reason to get mad.  They continued to nag on and on so i <br/>\nallerted my guild and they all thought the same thing.  A Wedding <br/>\nshould be held in private chat and if others talk in the zone just <br/>\nfilter the ooc and shouts.  The wedding was very badly planned and <br/>\nnow i have a whole guild mad at me.  ( the other guild that was <br/>\nhaving the marriage not mine)  I was wondering what you all think of <br/>\nweddings in EQ and was i justified in shouting train and telling them <br/>\nthat they should hold their wedding in private if they don&#39;t want to <br/>\nhear all the shouts and ooc&#39;s of a zone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPiezie V&#39;rix<br/>\n47th Necromancer<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
