If any<br/>\nVerant admins monitor this list maybe they could post the stats on how<br/>\nmany hits the servers for the bazaar are getting and their processing<br/>\npercentage plus the net traffic stats. I bet that they will all<br/>\npractically be maxed out. Basically what I&#39;m saying is, yes the lag is<br/>\nannoying but be patient and give it time and it will quickly even itself<br/>\nout. The problem is not your computer, it&#39;s a combination of your<br/>\nconnection to the net and how many are also on at your local hub at the<br/>\nsame time you are, (if you have a broadband connection), and that the<br/>\nservers are taking a hellacious beating right now. The bank in Kelethin<br/>\nis this way, it lags when everyone is meeting there but when everyone is<br/>\nout hackin and slashin it&#39;s really smooth. <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Hunting!<br/>\nSteve<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nSteven R.
