Our purpose will be to enjoy this game for all it&#39;s worth -- \nto help each other, to teach those new to Norrath the skills they will need to \nsurvive. Rules will be simple -- things such as never beg, never ks, and always \nhelp your guildmate first. We will also be focused on life in Norrath being more \nthan just the battle -- other skills are given to you for a reason. Want to \nlearn how to tailor? You&#39;ve got to start with the basics, and if you and a \ncouple of guildmates want a nice quiet night, why not go out together and gather \nspiderling silks to get going? Or get together for a trip to Steamfont to pick \nup some supplies for smithing? \n<p>We will also be planning raids for various levels, a couple of parties... and \nmaybe even a wedding or two. ) \n<p>So if you&#39;re interested in helping us create this guild, just to have fun, \neither leave a post here, or email to akane@... with your character \nname, level, class and race, along with an email address where we can reach you. \n\n<p>Look forward to hearing from you! ) \n<p>***Akane<br>Wood Elf Ranger of 13 seasons</p></font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
