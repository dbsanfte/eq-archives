Even if I&#39;m already in a group I get people\n<br>sending me tells asking for a heal or a bind. They&#39;ll expect me to leave my\n<br>group and go find them to bind or heal. but most people are polite about it.\n<br>If I ask for clarity or breeze I generally offer to donate or pay for said\n<br>service. Or I offer to return a buff if my buffs are good enough.\n<br>I mostly have people outside my group being polite. but when I have people\n<br>in my group they can be rather rude. Like I was grouped with his one kid\n<br>(who I later found out was only 9 yrs old) who kept saying &quot;Heal me. HEAL\n<br>ME!&quot; when he wasn&#39;t even halfway down and I&#39;d already told him I was out of\n<br>mana. I had said to other people I swore he was only 10. but then his father\n<br>told me he was 9.\n<br>Personally I don&#39;t think kids that age should play EQ. Especially when they\n<br>could potentially screw things up for other people&#39;s characters.\n<br>go figure.\n<br>luv,\n<br>-Su</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br>\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\"><b><i>\n<br></i></b></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
