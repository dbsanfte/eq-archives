However, we are playing around the world, and so <br/>\naround the clock. Still, if you have a good alt, you could park your <br/>\nranger in Everfrost and hunt when it is good. When it is not so good <br/>\nyou can camp the ranger and switch to your alt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend finding a high point overlooking the frozen river. You <br/>\ncan see the mammoths coming and intercept. You can often see if it <br/>\nhas been grabbed by another player or group as well, allowing you to <br/>\nfocus on another target.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;J.

Thus I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   recommend going there to anyone but druids. Track is<br/>\n&gt;   absolutely essential or you just plain won&#39;t get any<br/>\n&gt;   mobs, and even more important is the ability to leave<br/>\n&gt;   and go hunt in SK or somewhere else when the zone is<br/>\n&gt;   overcrowded.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt;   Only a few days left to file! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://taxes.yahoo.ca\">http://taxes.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
