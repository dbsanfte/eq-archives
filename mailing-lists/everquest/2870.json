I also heard horror stories about people<br/>\nwho ordered the Ti from Best Buy bc Best Buy was offering a really low price<br/>\n(they basically mixed the price up with another card but didn&#39;t correct the<br/>\nerror until it was too late). They refused to ship the item after already<br/>\nbilling the customers. Customers had to file paperwork or call their credit<br/>\ncard companies to get their money back. In one particularly nasty case Best<br/>\nBuy had a guy arrested when he tried to pick up his card that he had<br/>\npurchased online from a store. They claimed he was trying to defraud the<br/>\nstore and called the police. Pretty crappy eh?<br/>\nOk, that&#39;s my rant for the day.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have played with both cards and I thought the Geforce 4 Ti made things<br/>\n </span></blockquote>look better than the &gt;MX. The 4 MX seems to basically be a 2 MX, just faster<br/>\nand more memory. I may take back my &gt;MX and get the Ti, the day that I spent<br/>\nwith that card was the most enjoyable day I ever spent in &gt;EQ.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
