Then you right click on them or hit U. If you are not<br/>\nKOS to them you can sell.<br/>\nYeah, there is a whole underground area of SK and necro and evil races<br/>\ntrainers and stuff down there. Gotta be careful. If you want to work on your<br/>\nfaction, kill Deathfist Pawns. Turn in 4 picks to Tashan Hallard in<br/>\nHallard&#39;s Resales in East Fp. It gets you good faction. If you have good<br/>\nenough faction to go down to the rogue guild guy (I think there&#39;s the<br/>\ncounterparts to Janem and Rebby-- who are by the monk guild in West<br/>\nFreeport). There is a note deliver quest you can do that gets you good<br/>\nfaction with them.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; yes I did that with my WoodElf rOGUE GOT TO LVL 5 WAS<br/>\n&gt; SUPER BORED IN Faydwer so got a tp to WC then I am<br/>\n&gt; still hunting in EC & doing very well, no one will<br/>\n&gt; sell to me in Freeport though that sux and I got<br/>\n&gt; attacked by SK or something I didn&#39;t see it was such a<br/>\n&gt; fast death (a de sk I think it was) when I went into<br/>\n&gt; the underground part of town to practice my skills<br/>\n&gt; that sucked~ had to sneak all the way back in and<br/>\n&gt; slowly drag my corpse out lol woohoo~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ecko~<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
