And it gives you a chance to <br/>\nlevel much quicker. Typically people beng PL&#39;d already have high <br/>\nlevel characters and are simply getting help in order to supplement <br/>\ntheir guild with a different race so they can go on more afective <br/>\nraids. <br/>\n<br/>\nI created a Ranger and spent the last 2 years getting him to 35. Then <br/>\nI created a dwarf rogue and PL&#39;d him to 35 so that I could join a <br/>\nguild that frowned on Rangers, once I was in the Ranger tagged along. <br/>\nSoon after that I got another account and created a druid which was <br/>\nplayed by myself and friends of mine, essentially PL&#39;ing it to mid <br/>\n40&#39;s so that I could run my Ranger and Rogue around with gates (my <br/>\nson has several characters on both accounts that he uses as well, <br/>\nnone PL&#39;d). <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the integrity aspect of it, thats a matter of opinion. Since  <br/>\nwhen I am PL&#39;ing I am more interested in the level over the goods, <br/>\nnoob&#39;s benefit since I give away 90% of what I get. My guild <br/>\nbenefits, since we have a more diverse membership (who wants a guild <br/>\nfull of bloody druids anyway?). However I don&#39;t believe that high <br/>\nlevel characters should be allowed to camp out a noob location to <br/>\nbenefit just their friends. They should show alot more nobility and <br/>\nclass by assisting any others that may be fighting in the area.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents worth<br/>\n<br/>\nDagdason <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Richard Ong&quot; &lt;nakor@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Mmm... it&#39;s true that the peopel who are getting PLed are not doing <br/>\n&gt; much work.  They level faster than people who actually level <br/>\n&gt; themselves.  I understand how you would think this is not really <br/>\nfair <br/>\n&gt; but sometimes people like to help others.  When I help people, I PL <br/>\n&gt; them.  I won&#39;t help them get equipment because that&#39;s what you need <br/>\n&gt; to do for yourself since it generally makes you more powerful <br/>\n&gt; especially magical items.  AND when I PL them, I don&#39;t take over <br/>\n&gt; camps to help them level.  I just look around for roaming mobs that <br/>\n&gt; are not a RARE of course and let them kill it.  Heal them when <br/>\n&gt; necessary.  The usual method.  I don&#39;t steal camps from people or <br/>\n&gt; camp things when tyring to PL &#39;em.  I know that&#39;s wrong cuz if I <br/>\ndid <br/>\n&gt; that I would feel like I&#39;m hogging the camp since I wouldn&#39;t get xp <br/>\n&gt; in the first place and it&#39;s a camp that everyone wants to have.  <br/>\nFor <br/>\n&gt; example, PLing in cb.  I just look for any orcs i see and let them <br/>\n&gt; kill it.  There are hardly any camps in there.  The only camps <br/>\nthere <br/>\n&gt; are in cb are in the castle itself and near the tents.  Anyway, my <br/>\n&gt; point is, is that I find it wrong when people take over camps to PL <br/>\n&gt; but I find it ok when people just kill roaming mobs to PL.  AND <br/>\nyeah, <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like when peopel twink.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t give peopel <br/>\n&gt; equipment or money.  Maybe leather armor but that&#39;s about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Dan&quot; &lt;danspth@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Opinions vary. I personally find the whole power leveling idea to <br/>\n&gt; be most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dishonorable. To see an orc camp taken over by a 50+ druid and a <br/>\nlv <br/>\n&gt; 6 ogre<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer reminds me how people <br/>\nare <br/>\n&gt; have no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; willingness to work for things (the whole cheat code thing). But <br/>\n&gt; many people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find it ok to twink/power level and, well, so be it. I can see <br/>\nit, <br/>\n&gt; shiver,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and keep moving. Live and let live. I am fortunate that at lv 43 <br/>\nI <br/>\n&gt; can solo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and this is only an inconvience at worse to me instead of a real <br/>\n&gt; issue. But<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up until lv 35 I was still having camps stolen from me by uber <br/>\n&gt; twinks and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anon druids.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Thomas H.
