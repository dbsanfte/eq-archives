Our lvl<br/>\n70 guild leader&#39;s cleric commonly shows up anywhere from 22 to 53, our necro<br/>\nis known to show as low as 3 thanks to his new ranger, and mine are all over<br/>\nthe board on all 3 accounts. Always worth a laugh when someone who doesn&#39;t<br/>\nknow my alts well wonders why I haven&#39;t bothered to level my enc since she&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;so close to KEI&quot;.  She&#39;s actually 38 now, and was about 22 at the time, but<br/>\ngets this every level or so. My sneaky 57 gnome wiz, always making trouble,<br/>\nhe is....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bad side is, 4 levels in a week on my mage and everyone thinks THAT&#39;S<br/>\nbugged, not legit :-)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: D.

So, I have to decide whether or not I want<br/>\n&gt; to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a higher price.<br/>\n&gt; I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me off that they<br/>\n&gt; pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an angry letter of<br/>\n&gt; complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>\n&gt; ARG.
