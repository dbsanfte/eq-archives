As a RL (or even <br/>\na participant in a raid), I have an obligation to <br/>\neveryone on that raid to make it go as smoothly as <br/>\npossible.  And if someone is repeatedly doing something <br/>\nto put the raid at risk, then the RL has an obligation <br/>\nto &quot;protect&quot; the rest of the raiders.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a 2-way street, Su.  If someone is screwing around, <br/>\nwasting other people&#39;s time, why should I allow him to <br/>\nstay on the raid?  I will give respect to nayone that <br/>\nearns it, but if a person doesn&#39;t have the decency to <br/>\nrespect the RL and the raiders, I&#39;m not going to get <br/>\nupset when I boot him (or when the RL boots him) from <br/>\nthe raid.<br/>\n<br/>\nA 2hr CR at midnight really sucks, especially if you <br/>\nhave to get up early the next morning for work.  It&#39;s <br/>\nfar worse when it&#39;s caused by some jack@ss that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel the need to listen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say we don&#39;t have fun on our raids, <br/>\nbecause we do.  But we know that when it&#39;s time to get <br/>\nto work, the play time stops.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if I wante to be nasty, I&#39;d leave them in the zone, <br/>\nungroupsed, with no way to get out.  Or I&#39;d let them die <br/>\nand get their own damn corpse.  A TL is humane.<br/>\n<br/>\nSulamwen<br/>\nOutrider of &lt;Fate&#39;s Forge&gt;<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
