This increases<br/>\nyour faction with the people in Kaladim. Oh, and killing the BB bandits will<br/>\nincrease your faction with the citizens of Kaladim. Possibly the Stormguard<br/>\ntoo. So get a group and pick off the bandits. Beware that PegLeg and his<br/>\ngroup undercon. They may be green but they hit hard and fast. They tend not<br/>\nto stay rooted very long. They like to gang up on you. So get someone who<br/>\ncan harmony/mezmerize or snare. Then kick the crap out of em one at a time.<br/>\nIf a lesser spirit spawns when you kill Peg Leg do NOT kill it. It is bad<br/>\nfaction with shamans if you do.<br/>\nAlso, keep the Runnyeye Warbeads to turn in to the guy in the same building<br/>\nas the guy who takes the belts and pads.<br/>\nByzar Bloodforge I think..<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve started an iksar monk named Zainal....leve 14 (so close to double<br/>\n&gt; damage)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I&#39;ve decided to have great faction with him with almost<br/>\n </span></blockquote>everyone...cept<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the people who don&#39;t matter like the orcs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I was just wondering....does anyone know how to get better faction<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; the merchants?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m currently killing everything in Crushbone (or will be when I make 15)<br/>\n&gt; for faction with Storm Guards (dwarven guards in BB and Kaladim&#39;s warrior<br/>\n&gt; guild)<br/>\n&gt; Then I&#39;ll start turning in the pads/belts for faction.
