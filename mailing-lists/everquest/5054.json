I played for the first time on his computer the other night.<br/>\nTechno-envey and power lust have me big time. I still limp along on a<br/>\nnearly three year old etower 600mh rig with limited memory and graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo cruise the Bazaar with hardly a hitch. To visit POK and be able to<br/>\nmove in a normal fashion. Ah. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is we work different schedules with different days off.<br/>\nSince we (gasp) share an account, we can&#39;t play at the same time,<br/>\nanyway. So, on my days off I borrow his system and live the EQ life<br/>\nthe way it was intended to be lived.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise I play Gamecube. Almost done with Windwaker. Stalled in<br/>\nMetroid Prime; gotta get in there and try harder. And I actually play<br/>\nAnimal Crossing every day. That would be so uncool if the game weren&#39;t<br/>\nso well designed and balanced. You can&#39;t kill anything, but I<br/>\nsurrounded Bill&#39;s house with pitfalls. How&#39;s that for evil AC?<br/>\n<br/>\nI really appreciate the gaming community here. You all enhance my<br/>\ngaming experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
