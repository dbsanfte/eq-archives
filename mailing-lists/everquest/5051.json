And it&#39;s very difficult to do some of<br/>\nthe adventures without a mezzer.<br/>\nAnd sometimes if you have to locate a mob and kill it before a certain<br/>\ntime-period is up, the mob doesn&#39;t spawn until literally 3 minutes before<br/>\ntime is up and you can&#39;t get to it before then. I haven&#39;t had much luck, but<br/>\nhopefully the next time I actually get to play I&#39;ll have better luck. I<br/>\nthink the 7 level difference sucks though.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Paid a few extra bucks and bought it from AllaKhazam.  So I got a CD<br/>\n&gt; and the easy of loading it that way.  I also got the pack of Abu-Kar<br/>\n&gt; and did the quest to upgrade it.  The Dungeons have a D&D feel, but<br/>\n&gt; the whole system feels like AO to me.  But the XP and PP are great.<br/>\n&gt; And some of the rewards are outta sight!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n&gt; Pathfinder of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Terris-Thule<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
