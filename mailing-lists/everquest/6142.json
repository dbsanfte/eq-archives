I&#39;m going to talk to them when their CS opens today. I had a problem with my mother&#39;s account and them saying she didn&#39;t have the new expansion registered. I had to email them and complain. They took care of it fairly quickly. Considering they might lose 4 accounts from me, they better do something when I contact them. <br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-04-25, 22:46:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If they still owe you time or $$$ then contact them and sort it out.

I went to login to check my email and apparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea why. Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with my brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not I want to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a higher price. I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me off that they pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an angry letter of complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>\n&gt;  ARG.
