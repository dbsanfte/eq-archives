Using","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-619855929\">From <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/new_items.jsp\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/new_items.jsp</a><br/>\nThe Lost Dungeons of Norrath introduces an exciting new type of treasure to<br/>\nEverQuest. Using new modular items gained from dungeon adventures,<br/>\ncharacters are able to modify the powers and effects of their equipment,<br/>\nallowing for a tremendous amount of customization.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing these new items, characters can augment an existing breastplate, for<br/>\nexample. Bonding the proper augmentation item to the breastplate might give<br/>\nit +5 strength. Bonding a different augmentation item could give it +6<br/>\nwisdom. These are just a few simple examples; the new items have a wide<br/>\nvariety of possible effects and benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a helmet that you like, but think needs a little boost? This new item<br/>\nsystem allows you to customize that helmet and make it fit your character&#39;s<br/>\nneeds better. Most characters have a favorite item that they&#39;ve had in their<br/>\nbank for a while. They don&#39;t want to destroy it because it holds some<br/>\nmemories, a link to the adventures they had gaining it. With this new item<br/>\naugmentation system, those items gain new life and endless potential!<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this will be pretty cool. I have some items that I like that I would<br/>\nlove to augment. I guess it means the new items you find will allow you to<br/>\naugment current armor. Someone likened it to the way gems affect items in<br/>\nDiablo II. At the live chat they said that the augmentations can be undone<br/>\nbut that then they would be lost or something. And they said certain types<br/>\nof armor can only take certain types of mods. Any comments or thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
