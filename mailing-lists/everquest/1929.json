The loot is pretty good, cash anything <br/>\nfrom poor to fair, and the hunting interesting. Getting there was a <br/>\nspecial adventure for me, as I am KOS in Neriak. I went in chamo and <br/>\nlevitated, turned left as I entered the forest, and kept to the zone <br/>\nwall. There is a river half way through the zone, which I levved <br/>\nacross (not being a good swimmer) and kept on along the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really liked the rock dervishes. Good cash and they dropped ore, <br/>\nwhich sells well but is heavy. I would pick up a load until I was <br/>\nencumbered even with strength, then port to a selling point. If you <br/>\ncan find someone to port the stuff out at a discount, the ore would <br/>\nbe profitable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mostly solo, so that is what I did there. Lots of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting.<br/>\n <br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Pedgar1787@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Where to go to fight for a 15 Shaman?
