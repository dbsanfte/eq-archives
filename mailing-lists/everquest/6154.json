Great to see ya!<br/>\nThere are so many things they need to fix and there is alot they can learn from World of Warcraft.<br/>\nIf they could get EQ to load half as fast as WoW I would be happy. There are also some cool combat features in WoW that make it a bit easier. Camera views are better and such. But considering how long ago EQ was first made and the technology available I think Verant did an incredible job. I realize it would be a royal pain for everyone to upgrade again though. Not only would it take programmers time and then have people working out the bugs on test, but they would have to upload it to all of the servers and then the players would have to download it all.<br/>\nScott is on this list so just wave to him. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-04-27, 09:41:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I see it like this Su.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A) it is probably a simple billing mistake<br/>\n&gt;B) SOE screwed up and should have backups of the char<br/>\n&gt;data files IF they are gone or damaged<br/>\n&gt;C) this is just another example of why we all need to<br/>\n&gt;start griping more and letting them know that after 6<br/>\n&gt;friggin years they should fix some crap.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Don&#39;t worry though, I am sure yer cleric and your<br/>\n&gt;bro&#39;s SK are fine.
