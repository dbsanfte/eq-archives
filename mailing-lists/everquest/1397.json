If you need to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1520781011\">If your faction allows, you can get to Runnyeye through <br/>\nRivervale/Misty Thicket. Runnyeye is on the far side of Misty just <br/>\nbehind a gob camp. If you need to hone your orc killing skills, there <br/>\nis an orc camp on the South side of Misty. I was able to solo the <br/>\ncamp at my present level, 14. The toughest thing that spawns there is <br/>\nan Orc Legionaire. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are gob camps in Misty, three of them. The toughest is a Gob <br/>\nAlchemist, which is still red to me. I train him to the guards to <br/>\nclear the area, since it is unpleasant to have him hit you while you <br/>\nare bashing two or three gobs. For more Gobs, enter Runnyeye. I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t hunted inside, since most Gobs give me little experience and <br/>\nthe ones that would have a lot of back-up inside the dungeon. I may <br/>\ntry it later, or with a group. The dungeon is quite large and <br/>\nelaborate, so I hear, and gets more difficult the deeper you go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother path to Runnyeye is through Beholder, otherwise known as <br/>\nGorge of King Xorbb. You can get into the gorge from the Eastern <br/>\nPlains of Karanas. I believe the entrance is to the North. There are <br/>\nlots of nasty things in the gorge for a level 14, so I travel fast <br/>\nand under camo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yeah.

I <br/>\ngroup<br/>\n&gt; &gt; once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a while, but prefer to develop solo skills. I am a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; relatively new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; player, so I am not sure just where I am going.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My current goal is attaining level 14, to gain SOW and <br/>\nbind. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plan to begin traveling and picking up some of the little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am drawn initially toward the Commons.
