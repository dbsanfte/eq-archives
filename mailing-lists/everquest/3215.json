I actually did forgat a few things and want to refamiliarize<br/>\nmyself, On the 3 bars that tell you your health and level status, I<br/>\nforgot what the blue line is for. I know it has something to do with<br/>\nyour charma or something like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I just started playing with a Necro just to see what it&#39;s like. Any<br/>\ngood suggestion for getting Necro stuff? BTW I&#39;m a Gnome. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are the elements a Magician needs to conjure up a elementa pet like<br/>\nfire or earth? I ran out and now I can&#39;t remember what I need to get!<br/>\nWhat a dummy!  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\nDurgaa<br/>\nShizney</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
