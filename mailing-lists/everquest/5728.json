Spiderling Silk, Spider Silk, Shadeling Silk, and Shade Silk sell for 1-5 plat each","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1107738354\">I have found silk to be one of the best ways to earn plat for us youngin&#39;s.<br/>\nSpiderling Silk, Spider Silk, Shadeling Silk, and Shade Silk sell for 1-5<br/>\nplat each in the bazaar.  You can carry 20 in a stack and they are so light<br/>\nyou never worry about being encumbered.  Many places have spiders,<br/>\nbonecrawlers, widows, etc that drop silk so you should be able to find a<br/>\nplace to farm that is friendly to you.  I am using a human (level 8) at the<br/>\nmoment and he has been haning out in the commonlands.  Once the spiderlings<br/>\ngo green I start on the bigger spiders.  Not only am I making $$ I am<br/>\nimproving my skills the whole time.  Loot all the spider parts, sell<br/>\neverything to local vendors but keep the silk.  When selling to vendors look<br/>\nat their stock.  Occasionally I find silk for sale for a gold or two, buy it<br/>\nall!  When you have enough silk sell it in the bazaar.  See what others are<br/>\nselling it for and price it the same as the lowest priced guy.  Demand is<br/>\nhigh enough I always sell out in under and hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my cleric I use my spells to kill since you can get better at casting<br/>\neven if you cast on green creatures.  I have noticed the my melee char does,<br/>\non rare occasions, improve skills on green chars.  This is contrary to what<br/>\nI have read in a few places, but it is so rare you might as well say melee<br/>\nskills never go up on green.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your on a server that allows for more then one character, make one char<br/>\nand send it to the bazaar right away.  That char will now live in the bazaar<br/>\nso it does not need skills or equip.  Gather silk and put in shared bank.<br/>\nSwitch to bazaar char and sell, drop plat in shared bank and swtitch back to<br/>\nmain char.  Keeps you from running so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nGloomingdeep silk is an exception.  Have not sold any in bazaar, sell to<br/>\nvendors.  Don&#39;t buy if you find it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: vampirezach2000 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vampirezach2000@...\">vampirezach2000@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, June 20, 2004 11:10 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] Easy pp<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was wonderin where is a good place for a lvl 7 def cleric to get<br/>\n&gt; good pp?
