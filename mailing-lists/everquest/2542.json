There just aren&#39;t a lot of places to get it the GF <br/>\narea.  Another option are the Frozen or Velium weapons coming out of <br/>\nVelious.  I&#39;ve seen them for as little as 10 PP, and sometimes people <br/>\njust give them away!<br/>\n<br/>\nAny Avatar I&#39;ve started in GF or BB has always done the CB belt quest <br/>\nas many times as possible.  You have to load up and go see the <br/>\nDwarves, then sell any armor and weapons you don&#39;t want.  Also, <br/>\npeople do buy them, and if you can sneak into Crushbone you can clean <br/>\nup.  Some people can&#39;t be bothered with them and will just leave them <br/>\naround.  Make sure to ask unless there&#39;s nobody nearby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, since I assume you are one of those cute little Wood Elf Druids <br/>\njust flirt a little and all those big Warriors will fall all over <br/>\nthemselves to help you out! I know I would!  LOL  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood Hunting<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\nRanger of Tunare, Terris-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
