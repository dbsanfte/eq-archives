My video card is a Voodoo 3 with 64mb of<br/>\nram<br/>\n  in it. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on! This only started happening awhile<br/>\n  ago... and I haven&#39;t changed anything with my computer... I even<br/>\nuninstalled<br/>\n  a bunch of crap to try and make more room... *shrugs*<br/>\n  Sincerely,<br/>\n  Deidre<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;What expansion do you have? Meaning Lucling, Trilogy,<br/>\n  &gt;etc.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;The reason I ask is if it is Luclin, chances are your<br/>\n  &gt;video memory is not enough for the rendering, not the<br/>\n  &gt;RAM of the system.  If you have 500MB of Ram, you have<br/>\n  &gt;plenty to run the game.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Do you know what video card you have and how much<br/>\n  &gt;Video Ram it can handle.  For instance, if I run<br/>\n  &gt;Luclin on my laptop, the people show up naked....lol<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;So your symptoms are different but I bet similar in<br/>\n  &gt;cause.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Let us know<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Rob<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;--- electrum101 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:electrum101@...\">electrum101@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Hey Everybody,<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to the list!
