Told me I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t use it to its fullest.  I am a level 3 Druid<br/>\nhalfling.  It is a wee harvester and I can&#39;t remember<br/>\nits stats and such but my question is should I have<br/>\nsold it because I didn&#39;t.?  I kept it.  It is magical<br/>\nand makes food for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else also told me to buy my level 1 and level<br/>\n5 spells.  I take it there are no level 2,3,4?  Should<br/>\nI look for the spells in this order<br/>\nBuff<br/>\nHeal<br/>\nStr<br/>\nCombat<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, You all have been very helpful<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
