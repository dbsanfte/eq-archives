Most of<br/>\nyour skills go up so fast at these early levels, that there is no need to<br/>\nput any of you practice points into any skill. Most people just save their<br/>\npoints to use later in life. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as some skills costing plat, gold etc., once you reach a certain<br/>\npoint in your skills, the train will not train you for free, you will have<br/>\nto pay him. So say at level 35 my warrior&#39;s sense heading skill is 96 and I<br/>\nhave 80 skill points to use and I want to increase my skill. The warrior is<br/>\npast the free training point and it would cost me 1 skill point and 5 gold<br/>\nto increase the skill to 97 and so on so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this wasn&#39;t too confusing, but I tried to explain it the best I know<br/>\nhow.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 8 ranger wrote:<br/>\n\tHey all.  I&#39;m a level 8 Half Elf ranger (first character) and I want<br/>\n<br/>\n\tto train up some of my abilities beyond the 5 practice credits I get<br/>\n<br/>\n\twhen I level.  I&#39;ve noticed several skills that have what look like <br/>\n\tprices (coins of varying colors with numbers inside them) but I have<br/>\n<br/>\n\tbeen unable to get the trainers to teach me those skills.  When I <br/>\n\tclick practice (after putting my practice credits into another <br/>\n\tskill), it tells me that I&#39;m out of practice credits and have to go <br/>\n\tadventuring some more.  Is there ANY way to pay gold (or silver or <br/>\n\tcopper) for training?  If so, HOW?  What do I click and all?  It <br/>\n\tshows my available money and I&#39;ve got the cash, but I just can&#39;t<br/>\nseem <br/>\n\tto get the trainer to take the money and train me.<br/>\n\tThanks for any help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t------------------------ Yahoo!
