I got my hubby involved in EQ<br/>\nso he&#39;d stop bugging me to get off the computer.  He&#39;s got a 10th lvl<br/>\nhalfling fighter, and I know next to nothing about the melee classes.<br/>\nAssuming he&#39;s got about 1000pp to spend, what are his best choices for armor<br/>\nand a decent weapon.  He&#39;s got a fine steel longsword right now, which seems<br/>\nto suck, and leather armor.  Should he go to bronze or fine steel armor?<br/>\nWhat does a full suit of either of these cost?  And what&#39;s the best weapon<br/>\nfor him at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m trying to powerlevel him just a little so we can go adventuring<br/>\ntogether, though I&#39;m not generally a fan of leveling people that don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat they&#39;re doing.  They should die plenty and learn like the rest of us<br/>\ndid :P  I have a 16 druid and he just needs a couple of levels so we can<br/>\nhang out.  Is there a good place to do this quickly?  All I can think of at<br/>\nthe moment is to fear kite lions and bears, oh my, and let him hack them up.<br/>\nThere&#39;s so darn many people in EC these days, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
