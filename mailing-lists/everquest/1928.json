Provided it&#39;s not over camped. If<br/>\nyou get in a good group around lvl 18 you can take orcs-- but be careful,<br/>\nthey gang up something nasty. I was actually fighting orcs when I was lvl<br/>\n13-- with my wizard. She would DS the people in group and occassionally get<br/>\nin a good AE spell to draw attention off the cleric. Heh, I took to calling<br/>\none of my spells &quot;Wizard Taunt&quot; bc it would always get the mobs after me. I<br/>\nsuicided alot of times to save the cleric. But at lvl 13 and 14 it wasn&#39;t<br/>\ntoo much of an xp loss.<br/>\nBut Blackburrow is still a nice place to stay for awhile. Elite ledge is a<br/>\nnice place to hunt.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where to go to fight for a 15 Shaman?
