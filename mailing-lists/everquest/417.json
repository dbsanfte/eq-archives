The game (Everquest) doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlook<br/>\ntoo much different from my last card, but other games are much much<br/>\nbetter.<br/>\nWell worth the money in my opinion.<br/>\nScio<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blizzard15@...\">blizzard15@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blizzard15@...\">blizzard15@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am building a new computer and I was wondering if any of you have had any<br/>\n&gt; experience with the Voodoo3 2000. Does it give good enough performance to<br/>\n&gt; warrant buying it? Also would the following system give good performance on<br/>\n&gt; EverQuest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Celeron 433<br/>\n&gt; 128 MB PC100 SDRAM<br/>\n&gt; Diamond Monster MX300<br/>\n&gt; Abit BX6 Rev2<br/>\n&gt; Maxtor 10.2GB 5400 RPM<br/>\n&gt; Diamond SupraExress 56K Internal ISA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also I&#39;ve been seeing that the Cable Modems aren&#39;t that good for EQ, but I<br/>\n&gt; was wondering how bad are they? Will they get at least better performance<br/>\n&gt; than a 56K? Answers to any of these questions would be very appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Blizzard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
