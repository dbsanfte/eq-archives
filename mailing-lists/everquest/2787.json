Got it installed and went for a test drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne area that is a big problem is Rivervale. With the last expansion <br/>\nRivervale became so laggy that I avoided going home when I could. Now <br/>\nI get a few hiccups when I enter the zone, then it settles down to a <br/>\nplayable level. A hitch now and then, but nothing like before the <br/>\nupgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\nChecked out a few cities, some zones in between. Made technical <br/>\nadjustments. On the whole quite pleased.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I noticed was a bit of lag in laggy zones (Luclin was <br/>\nalmost unplayable until now)until I had been there a bit. When I went <br/>\nto the Bazaar I just did a slow 360 and the lag went away. Figure <br/>\nenough of the zone loaded into active memory to carry the play from <br/>\nthen on. Perhaps someone could explain what was actuall happening to <br/>\nthe system when I do this. Anyway, I do a scan of my environment when <br/>\nI zone and things are pretty smooth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my last upgrade to my present system. Have to replace my <br/>\ntower next, and hope to hold out a while. How much can I spend every <br/>\nyear on these things? The family expects me to feed them, and I hate <br/>\nto dissppoint them too often on that account just to play my game.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if DSL comes down a bit in price, I may try that. Could that be <br/>\nthe key to absolute smooth-as-butter-on-a-bald-monkey performance on <br/>\nmy aging machine? (The thing is just a bit over a year old. How fast <br/>\nthey grow old.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
