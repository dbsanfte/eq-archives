They are to be held in high regard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will always be those who will have fun with language, and cause<br/>\nit to evolve in new and interesting ways. Especially with these new<br/>\ndevelopments in communications. Their courage and spirit is to be admired.<br/>\n<br/>\nI encourage both views, for without some restraint, a mutating<br/>\nlanguage will cease to do what it must. Communicate. Without change<br/>\nover time, a language will stagnate and no longer relate to the world<br/>\nas it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I straddle my polyphonic fence, I can enjoy the richness of both<br/>\nsides. The joy of lex is a form of masturbation, but usually won&#39;t get<br/>\nyou into trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nWords are fun to play with. Quite affordable, and such a delight.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, lori smith &lt;lizardbretteq@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; nope sorry i like the way i type ok? i really like it alot and its<br/>\nmuch much ezier ( or in your tongue easier) c (see) how much funner<br/>\nand ezier (easier)it is!!?? now , i hate to sound rude, but will U<br/>\n(YOU) plz (please) shut up and let ppl(people) talk or type like they<br/>\nwant to!! and there r (are) lots of other ppl (people) that type like<br/>\nthis and no one ever says ne(any) thing!! now leave us alone!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gina Peterson &lt;gina@m...&gt; wrote:PLEASE.... in the name of all that<br/>\nis holy... could you learn to spell out<br/>\n&gt; complete words?
