Is it not drawing<br/>\nmuch interest? Do we have too many places to go? Or are they just not<br/>\nkeeping the site updated?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;mlockridge01&quot; &lt;MLockridge01@c...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; We bought the expansion for some of the features, rather than any<br/>\n&gt; plans to go there. However, since we got the new computer, I have been<br/>\n&gt; thinking of someday making the trip.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Trouble is, I don&#39;t know how to get there. Granted, I haven&#39;t yet<br/>\n&gt; tried, but when I look on some of the EQ sites I visit, I don&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; any way to get there. Is there a boat? From where? Is it even worth<br/>\n&gt; going there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t even gone to Jagged Pines since we got a machine that makes<br/>\n&gt; the zone playable. In fact, I need to visit lots of places. I have<br/>\n&gt; only limited experience on Luclin due to the lag. Been working Crystal<br/>\n&gt; Caverns this last week, my first week on the new machine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
