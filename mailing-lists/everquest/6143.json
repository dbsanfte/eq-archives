I havent played EQ since May of last <br/>\nyear, and was hoping to return next month if all goes well. I am cer <br/>\nworried about my two accounts..which havent been paid for in quite <br/>\nawhile...I hope they are still all good and such. I put alot of <br/>\ntime, effort, sweat, and tears into them and wou;d hate to loose <br/>\nthem..<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh..I guess time will tell...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always...Greg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Yeah.

Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with <br/>\nmy brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not <br/>\nI want to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a <br/>\nhigher price. I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me <br/>\noff that they pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an <br/>\nangry letter of complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  ARG.
