You enter the Grounds of Fate, turn right before entering the PVP<br/>\n&gt; area and go up the ramp. At the top turn left and follow the elevated<br/>\n&gt; walkway to the building at the other end. Go inside and turn to the left.<br/>\n&gt; Captain Tillin is standing outside on the balcony.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Be aware that turning in gnoll fangs to him lowers your faction with the<br/>\n&gt; Corrupt Qeynos Guards.
