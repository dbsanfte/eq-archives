My<br/>\n&gt; question is this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Are the trade skills really good and do they play a<br/>\n&gt; part of succeeding at higher levels?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Here is why I ask.  My friend is a level 17 druid and<br/>\n&gt; a tailor.  He can&#39;t make armor that my level 13 Ranger<br/>\n&gt; can use that is worthwhile to me.  I bought some mail<br/>\n&gt; boots and chest armor, which are far better than what<br/>\n&gt; he can make.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am also doing pottery with my Druid and I can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; any value to this trade.  If I make 30 muffin tins, is<br/>\n&gt; some baker really going to buy the lot off me?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I feel that as I get up in level, I will be able to<br/>\n&gt; get better Drop items than I can make.<br/>\n&gt; However, I do know that trades take part in some<br/>\n&gt; quests and this is the only purpose I can see for<br/>\n&gt; them.  I think<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Am I missing something here?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trade confused!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; LAUNCH - Your Yahoo!
