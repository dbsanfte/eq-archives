A cool thing to<br/>\ndo is collect crushbone belts and turn them in. You get some patchwork armor<br/>\nthat you can wear. It&#39;s cruddy, but it&#39;s a start.<br/>\nBasically kill critters til you get armor. When you start hunting higher<br/>\nlevel mobs they start dropping more coin.<br/>\nMost of my characters are on the Tribunal.<br/>\nYou can contact Elzeria, Damita, and Tiladanu (I know I&#39;m missing some but<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember their names right now).<br/>\nWhat class and race?

I&#39;ve been enjoying it so far on the<br/>\n&gt; Tribunal Server. THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE! Leveling is pretty balance.<br/>\n&gt; Plenty of helpful players!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just looking for advice on how to get more money.
