It has been in the archives of<br/>\n&gt; Longleat House, the country seat of the Marquess of<br/>\n&gt; Bath, since the 18th century, but until now has been<br/>\n&gt; reserved for scholarly use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Longleat staff now plan to publish copies of the book.<br/>\n&gt; They have reproduced and eaten some of the recipes,<br/>\n&gt; including &quot;pyke and eles in balloke broth,&quot; a dish of<br/>\n&gt; pike and eels spiced with cloves, cinnamon and<br/>\n&gt; saffron, and a mixture of milk and colored eggs called<br/>\n&gt; &quot;ledlardes.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The pike and eels were very strong ... and when we<br/>\n&gt; made the dish we weren&#39;t as liberal with the spices as<br/>\n&gt; they were -- so it was pretty clear that medieval<br/>\n&gt; nobles didn&#39;t like bland food,&quot; said Kate Harris,<br/>\n&gt; Longleat&#39;s librarian and archivist.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At least one noblewoman adored the dish: &quot;That must<br/>\n&gt; our dame have or els she will be wrothe (angry),&quot; the<br/>\n&gt; book notes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Historians say the 80-page book offers new insight<br/>\n&gt; into the life of England&#39;s nobility, including its<br/>\n&gt; kings and archbishops, and was designed for the<br/>\n&gt; merchant and gentry classes who aspired to copy their<br/>\n&gt; betters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is divided into three sections: a history of noble<br/>\n&gt; feasts, including the banquet at King Henry V&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; coronation in 1413, a calendar of seasonal foods and a<br/>\n&gt; list of ingredients.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unlike modern cookbooks, it does not give quantities<br/>\n&gt; or cooking times -- cooks to the nobility were<br/>\n&gt; expected to be skilled enough to judge that for<br/>\n&gt; themselves. Scribbled Latin notes in the margin show<br/>\n&gt; that the book was used.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The book was printed by London-based printer Richard<br/>\n&gt; Pynson, a Norman who later became the king&#39;s official<br/>\n&gt; printer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Harris said it was brought to Longleat when Elizabeth<br/>\n&gt; Harley, whose mother Margaret later became the first<br/>\n&gt; Duchess of Portland, married the first Marquess of<br/>\n&gt; Bath in 1759.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The book reveals that Henry V&#39;s coronation feast<br/>\n&gt; featured a first course of 31 swans, roasted and<br/>\n&gt; probably redressed in their feathers. All carried<br/>\n&gt; signs praising the king.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This was followed by dishes of venison, antelope,<br/>\n&gt; porpoises and a range of fish, including carp, perch,<br/>\n&gt; and lamprey, on which King Henry I is said to have<br/>\n&gt; gorged himself to death.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is no mention of vegetables, and desserts are<br/>\n&gt; mentioned in passing as &quot;dowcetes.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Harris said menus for a feast for George Nevill, who<br/>\n&gt; became archbishop of York in 1465, list a wide range<br/>\n&gt; of bird dishes including sparrows, gannets, gulls,<br/>\n&gt; larks and peacocks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Presentation was lavish, with many animals served<br/>\n&gt; whole. Tables were often decorated with sugar<br/>\n&gt; sculptures that were painted and sometimes even<br/>\n&gt; gilded.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Harris said that contrary to popular belief, the<br/>\n&gt; nobility ate tidily and wasted little. They had knives<br/>\n&gt; and spoons, but used fingers instead of forks, a later<br/>\n&gt; Italian invention.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ********************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At least with stuffed peacock, you have a really nice<br/>\n&gt; flourishy toothpick as a souvenir when the meal is<br/>\n&gt; finished....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Beatrice<br/>\n&gt; (who thinks eel-stuffed roasted antelope would be<br/>\n&gt; yummy with her cup of espresso right now)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br/>\n&gt; http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; trimaris-temp-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
