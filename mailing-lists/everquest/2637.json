Do you know if the 1.5 Ghz<br/>\nDuron has been released yet? I always double everything when it is<br/>\navailiable. I have a 750 Duron now and 512MB of ram. I guess I need to get a<br/>\n1.5Ghz Duron, 1GB or ram and what ever video card is relatively cheap right<br/>\nnow, guess ill have to do some research on that. Maybe a 19&quot; monitor too.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Su<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Friday, April 05, 2002 10:13 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] hello<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have the same video card and it runs great on mine.
