I&#39;m no big fan of <br/>\nC&C games or Starcraft - I like truly immersive, original, and meticulously <br/>\ndesigned games - Homeworld is a great game - EQ is as well.  I guarantee <br/>\nanyone who tries Homeworld will be astounded with what the folks at Relic <br/>\ngames have accomplished.  It is sooooo much more than the typical harvest and <br/>\nbuild RTS.
