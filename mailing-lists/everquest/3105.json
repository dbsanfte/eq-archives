So, I have been beating up gobs in Permafrost and <br/>\ntaking their stuff. However, no ore yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone know how rare this drop is? Alakhazam said Ice Goblins drop <br/>\nthe stuff. Only Ice Goblins, or any Ice Goblin tribe mob? I have been <br/>\nbeating up any greens near the entrance, since I am solo there most <br/>\nof the time and it gets ugly in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I put in a little time there, then go out for some exp <br/>\nkills to balance my game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe new cultural tailoring stuff is great. I am working on getting my <br/>\nVale sewing kit before lvl 34. Then I will have to split my time <br/>\nbetween Kunark and Velious to get exp plus materials for tailoring. <br/>\nSome components will depend on my Gnome Mage, which I am glad I <br/>\ncreated even before the changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t keep up on all the new skills, items and quests. So much to do, <br/>\nso little time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
