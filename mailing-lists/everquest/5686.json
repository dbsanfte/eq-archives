It is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Initiate of Tunare neckpiece, that will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eventually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lead me to getting a neck piece that has a mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; free<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; root effect.  I am having problems getting the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rancerous Ghouls to spawn in Lesser Faydark.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; done all day (real time) camps running around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; killing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; undead, and tracking, but can&#39;t seem to get them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spawn.  Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iaeerwen Feywarder<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Druid of the 20th Season.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure that they spawn anymore... I think they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were only there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fore a couple of weeks for a special &#39;event&#39; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; couple of years ago, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the quest involving them dates to that event too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I may be wrong, but I don&#39;t think that quest works<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anymore.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Honig Wayfarer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 65 Ranger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Version: 6.0.644 / Virus Database: 412 - Release<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: 01/04/2004<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
