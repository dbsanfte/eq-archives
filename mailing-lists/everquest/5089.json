(spawns \n  once every 11.4 hours and the Staff is Very rare drop off of him)&nbsp; The \n  torch off Neh ashir (Spawns of the Top&nbsp;Reaver Torch is a rare drop off of \n  him)&nbsp;&nbsp;in Com. &nbsp; There are other pain in the ass peices as well \n  the element of fire in Sol A takes forever to get, the pages in najena were \n  just about as bad.&nbsp; </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">&nbsp;</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">Hope this helps</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">&nbsp;</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">Nakoor TheRedRider</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">65 Mage Solesk \n  Ro&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Honor \n  First Unity Forever&quot;</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">Officer of Sacred \nHonor</div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
