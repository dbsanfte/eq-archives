My laptop, less then one year old, is still unable to get on as the card is no longer supported. When I finally did get through to tech support I was told by one of their &quot;experienced tech support personnel &quot; that my backup computer is a dinosaur and unable to use their game any more... it&#39;s 2 years old but the graphics card is what&#39;s holding it up. </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Hmm choices, decisions, should I use my back up computer with the slow processor to run my business, my laptop which my husband uses in his semi truck so it&#39;s usually at the other side of the country, my business computer to play around on and hope the IRS don&#39;t find out about the deduction I&#39;ve claimed,&nbsp;or should I just tell EQ what I think of them and cancel all our accounts?
