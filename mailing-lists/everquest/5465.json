Is there a website that has <br/>\nthe dye recipes and the steps I need to take to make dyes? I found <br/>\nsomething on Allakazham but it just listed the components needed and <br/>\nnot what I need to do with them. I hunted in N. Karana to kill <br/>\nbeetles and get Plains Roots and put one at a time in a brewer along <br/>\nwith a water flask. I am up to 3 in brewing now LOL. But no dye. Do I <br/>\nneed to be putting a bottle or empty flask in there too with the <br/>\nother stuff? And does anybody know what color Plains Dye is? Thanks <br/>\nin advance for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnie Menieminiemoe 31 Erudite Enchantress<br/>\nLamorie Sabreblade 22 Barbarian Warrior<br/>\nLilmomma Layofhands 22 Halfling Cleric<br/>\nLorlei Kissofdeath 20 Human Shadow Knight<br/>\nOnehomelysista 5 Ogre Shaman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
