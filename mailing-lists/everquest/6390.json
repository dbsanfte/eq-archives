Also started<br/>\n&gt; playing Everquest like a few days ago. So I hope that this group would<br/>\n&gt; enhance my game playing. One more thing, I wanted to know how I can<br/>\n&gt; look for local Everquest groups. I live in Brooksville, FL. So if<br/>\n&gt; anyone has any ideas, please let me know. Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
