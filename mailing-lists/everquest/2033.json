It gives them a broader customer base.

A customer with<br/>\nmoney adds a flavor of long lasting customer relation ships. You however,<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t meet these standards (you self who said it). So, you think Verant<br/>\nshould keep the old game just cause some of the old customers, who btw<br/>\nbought this game which clearly stated on the bottom of the box that OS and<br/>\nhardware requirments could/will change, can&#39;t pay for the new produc that.<br/>\nYou know the product that will keep EQ alive and not let it die before the<br/>\nend of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet real Su, if they wouldn&#39;t have updated EQ they wouldnt survive a month.<br/>\nA company that chose to develop shit for a old tech ain&#39;t a company with a<br/>\nlong lasting future.<br/>\n<br/>\n-domi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Ursprungligt meddelande-----<br/>\nFrån: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\nSkickat: den 14 december 2001 23:58<br/>\nTill: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nÄmne: Re: [EverQuest] I hate Shadows of Luclin and I don&#39;t even own it<br/>\nyet...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen my friend&#39;s computer run.

But to some other people<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rent-to-own basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easy to say they should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; escape for them. To<br/>\n&gt; suddenly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; financially stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nothing else. Btw, someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Where was that again? I just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; RAM with it&#39;s motherboard<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chipset. luv, -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not cost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; $265 after tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The chip is a AMD Athlon 950.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
