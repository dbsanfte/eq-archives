But to get good skills, get<br>\n&gt;in a group and fight on orc hill up to lvl 8<br>\n&gt;then go into CB.

Solo?<br>\nBwahahahahahahahahahaha...&quot;. ;) (hey, my main&#39;s a<br>\ndruid, i&#39;ve gotta give all the other non-necro classes<br>\na hard time about soloing :) Honestly, from what I<br>\nunderstand (having a friend with a lvl 30 Cleric and<br>\nhaving talked to/grouped with others), Clerics just<br>\nplain don&#39;t solo past 20. It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to<br>\nfind a group though, Clerics of a decent level are<br>\nalways in short supply. I&#39;d be inclined to head<br>\nsomewhere like Cazic-Thule or Guk. Plenty of yummy<br>\nundead in LGuk, just shout LFG there and max out your<br>\n&quot;Ego&quot; skill while everyone fights over you. :) Of<br>\ncourse, if you absolutely insist on soloing, hit<br>\neqatlas.com and take your pick of the 30+ undead heavy<br>\nzones. Personally, i&#39;d rather have a pet warrior or<br>\ntwo around to soak up the damage though... :)</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n</span></blockquote></font></font></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
