Seems<br/>\nto fit here)<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant must want a lot of people available when Star Wars Galaxies comes<br/>\nonline.  Or Anarchy online.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen calculating the cost of their crappy customer service I sure hope<br/>\nthey&#39;re not taking into account the fees of the amateur guides who would<br/>\nnormally be paying to play EQ.  And yes, I consider any company who makes<br/>\nyou wait up to three hours just to *answer* a complaint crappy... if you get<br/>\nan answer at all.  Apparently /petition requests get purged from the lists<br/>\nif they sit there more than 3 hours.  Would you sit on hold on the phone for<br/>\nthree hours with or without an 800 line?  I sure wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guild has people who are also interested in playing other MMORPG&#39;s, some<br/>\nof us are in Beta for Anarchy Online, and believe you me, if enough of us<br/>\nare interested we&#39;ll be porting the guild over to a new game.  Why stay with<br/>\na company who assumes we are guilty or too stupid to own an account?  Plus<br/>\nif you share a PC, or are on a home network and are connected to the PC of<br/>\nsomeone who is NOT computer savvy, you are also vulnerable.  I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthe average home user should have an MS Certification in Network<br/>\nadministration just to play a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nKellee<br/>\nTunare Server<br/>\nDiela, 26 Bard<br/>\nDiablesse, 14 Enchanter<br/>\nSanika, 17 Iksar Shaman<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Paul Martin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pmartin66@...\">pmartin66@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 14, 2001 4:44 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: SV: [EverQuest] Verant&#39;s new security policy..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question is, why can&#39;t V simply transfer my stuff from my<br/>\n&gt; hacked account<br/>\n&gt; to a new account that I create??
