I have the same problem<br/>\nwhen I log on and end up having to log off and relog with 2 characters<br/>\nwhen I have friends that are on. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tOne solution is ICQ. I know it sucks and if your friends do not use<br/>\nit then this point is moot. But if everyone uses it, you can check to see<br/>\nif your friends are on-line.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSecond, there is a program that has just been released and is in <br/>\nbeta called EverGuild. It is by the same person that does the EverMon<br/>\nprogram and is supposed to be able to let you know when each person<br/>\non you list (configurable) is on-line. This is all done before launching EQ<br/>\nso you will know if someone is on-line or not. As the name applies it was<br/>\nbasically for Guilds, but as it stands right now you can monitor for Users,<br/>\nCharacters and Guilds. So believe this will be a very handy asset. Again,<br/>\nI believe the people that you want to see if they are on-line, must be running<br/>\nthe program also, but not for sure, As I just got the EverGuild program this<br/>\nmorning and haven&#39;t had a chance to check it out completely. But looks <br/>\nvery promising.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYour suggestion is very good, but in the mean time, you may want<br/>\nto check out these alternatives. Hope this helps.

I have a couple<br/>\n&gt;characters (Mithe on Cathic-Thule and another druid there). Everytime I<br/>\n&gt;get to that character selection screen I debate, should I play my ranger<br/>\n&gt;or druid. If I play the druid I will greatly fall behind my friends that<br/>\n&gt;only play one character. To solve this I&#39;d love to see /who friends<br/>\n&gt;available from the character selection or server selection screen that<br/>\n&gt;way i could tell who was on and on which server. Say I click on<br/>\n&gt;Cathic-Thule and see my high level friends are not on I could decide to<br/>\n&gt;start a new character on PVP server etc...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let me know what you think. If you agree petition or suggest this when<br/>\n&gt;online.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;thanks </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
