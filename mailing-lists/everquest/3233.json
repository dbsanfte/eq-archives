I get sooo many rez requests for my cleric. I mean,<br/>\nI will get people who contact me when I am in GD and want me to rez them in<br/>\nGuk. And I&quot;m not even talking about guildies.. My guildies are fairly nice<br/>\nabout that. There have been maybe 2 people in guild (not counting the ones<br/>\nrelated to me by blood) who annoyed me by wanting me to drop everything to<br/>\ngo either rez or powerlevel them. The rezzing doesn&#39;t bother me. I did over<br/>\n33 rezzes in 2 days. I received donations for 2 of them. But I felt good<br/>\nhaving helped people. I generally only ask for a rez if I can&#39;t get back to<br/>\nmy own corpse to rez it-- or if I&#39;m playing my bard or wizard.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; In regards to death in game and such.  There was a time<br/>\n&gt; when our highest level Cleric at the time was so<br/>\n&gt; inundated with requests from  guildies to rez them<br/>\n&gt; everytime they died.  It didn&#39;t matter that  there was a<br/>\n&gt; cleric in the zone that was happy to do the rez, for a<br/>\n&gt; small donation in most cases.  But the people that<br/>\n&gt; either had not been smart enough to carry enough pp on<br/>\n&gt; them or were just too cheap to donate for the rez were<br/>\n&gt; mostly the ones to beg our cleric to rezz them.  Now our<br/>\n&gt; cleric soon realized the pattern only after I had the<br/>\n&gt; gumption to mention it to him after I got a rezz from<br/>\n&gt; him, luckily he was only one zone over from where I had<br/>\n&gt; died and he was getting ready to log for the night so I<br/>\n&gt; managed to catch him when he wasn&#39;t busy.  Once I showed<br/>\n&gt; him the pattern he learned to not drop everything he was<br/>\n&gt; doing to rezz the poor soul and also checked to see if<br/>\n&gt; there was a cleric nearby before he even went to rezz<br/>\n&gt; the peep.  Unfortunately he got  one request too many<br/>\n&gt; when he was working on his Epic and he got fed up and<br/>\n&gt; left guild.  But the few of us who didn&#39;t bother him<br/>\n&gt; constantly if he was not busy he will still do teh rez<br/>\n&gt; for  us IF and only If we were not able to find one on<br/>\n&gt; our own.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But the rezzes really are  more of a priviledge than a<br/>\n&gt; right in the game. At least that is the way I see it.  I<br/>\n&gt; pretty much solo a lot onmy own atm when i am really not<br/>\n&gt; wanting to hurry up and level.  this helps me learn the<br/>\n&gt; zone I am in a little better and  I rarely ask for a<br/>\n&gt; rezz unless I have lost a level or I am very close to<br/>\n&gt; ding.  And if I must go to the guild for a rezz i make<br/>\n&gt; sure I have exhausted all the other avenues before going<br/>\n&gt; to teh guild to see if any of our rezzers are on.  Hell<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve even settled for a 35% on more occasion than I can<br/>\n&gt; count  if that was the best i could get and was quite<br/>\n&gt; happy with it. And i always make sure that I offer a<br/>\n&gt; donation whether I have said I would donate or not.<br/>\n&gt; Most times when I do get teh rezz I have had the<br/>\n&gt; donation rejected only because I made the effort to fork<br/>\n&gt; over the pp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cynfyn MacCulloch 51 DESK<br/>\n&gt; Halyburton Bearhugger 26 BarbShm<br/>\n&gt; Saltaque 12 HIEEnch<br/>\n&gt; Qapmoc 11 HalfElf Ranger<br/>\n&gt; Oroblram 9 Hu War<br/>\n&gt; Doktari 6 HIE Cleric<br/>\n&gt; Defender of the Faith<br/>\n&gt; Saryn </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
