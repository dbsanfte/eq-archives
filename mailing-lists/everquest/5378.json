I now have three character <br/>\n&gt; between level 10 and 15.  I have been going to Crushbone alot <br/>\n&gt; to hunt, and the tower in the field of bone is cool but I am <br/>\n&gt; getting tired of the same old stuff.  Where else can a <br/>\n&gt; character in the 10-20 range go to hunt where he can find a <br/>\n&gt; group easily?  I have looked over the EQ Atlas and see a lot <br/>\n&gt; of stuff for 1-10 and 30+. Since I may try some more <br/>\n&gt; class-race combos before I try and take anybody over 20 I <br/>\n&gt; could use some more places to fill the gap between newbie and <br/>\n&gt; experienced.  I am not interested in power-leveling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have EQ Evolution, so every expansion but LDON.  I play on <br/>\n&gt; the Tunare<br/>\n&gt; (sp?) server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
