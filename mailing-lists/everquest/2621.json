If you are camping a rare spawn that&#39;s all you can do.  You <br/>\nare usually focused on a certain item for a certain quest, so that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat keeps your interest up.  This is where friends or guildies help, <br/>\nas you know they will ask for your help on their boring camp.  I&#39;m in <br/>\nthe midst of the Ivy Etched Armor quests and I have several camps <br/>\nahead.  One guy is an 8 hour pop, if he pop&#39;s!  My buddies gladly <br/>\ncome along, and there&#39;s usually a few people around to chat with.  <br/>\nAnd there&#39;s always gems!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I would say look at what you need for what you want, and plan for <br/>\nit.  Many guilds take in new members in your level range, join up and <br/>\ntell them what you want to do.  Odds are there will many people <br/>\nwilling to help you, as long as you help them.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
