Some people<br/>\neven turn the ooc off.  As for yelling for you to Go Away...either they had<br/>\nbeen fighting off others trying to take the camp and didn&#39;t pay attention to<br/>\nyour request or they are just the kind of jerks i find a lot of in the game.<br/>\nBringing the mobs back to the camp was a bad idea since it might trigger<br/>\nmore mobs on you and them...a move some people use to wipe a group at a camp<br/>\nthen take it from them.  Asking ooc they may have not noticed, again might<br/>\nhave turned ooc off, especially if they had a fight going as messages fly by<br/>\nfast.  The only thing you can do is try to take them or run to zone.  When<br/>\none runs to zone with mobs always best to shout or ooc a train so anyone<br/>\nnear it hears that since in PC most people sit around the Shadow Haven ZL<br/>\nwaiting for a group to open.  As for what they will do to you later...most<br/>\npeople I have played with know about the kind of people who constantly do<br/>\nthings like this both intentionaly and unintentionaly.  They understand<br/>\npeople will train zone and often if they were not ready they have no way of<br/>\nshouting train without getting killed themselves.  People will listen to<br/>\nboth sides usually.  I even group almost daily with one lady who I trained<br/>\nand killed 3 times in one day.....guess she wanted to make sure she knew<br/>\nwhen I ran..lol.  Most people forget your name though, all you have to do is<br/>\nplay on..))</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
