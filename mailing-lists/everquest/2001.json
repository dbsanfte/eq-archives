In fact that is in the game now.  With<br/>\n&gt;the SoL expansion you can set it on a low res version<br/>\n&gt;of the entire game or high if you choose to  that<br/>\n&gt;includes both game world and player models ).  The <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It has everything to do with the lack of an old Vah<br/>\nShir model, which seems to be Verant&#39;s only<br/>\njustification for requiring everyone to update to<br/>\nDirectX 8.1 instead of having a dual standard of &quot;if<br/>\nyou want the new graphics/want to play Luclin,<br/>\nupdate&quot;. There has been no enhancements (at least to<br/>\nmy knowledge) of the pre-luclin graphics aside from<br/>\nthe new character models all of which can be disabled<br/>\nexcept for the Vah Shir model. By allowing users to<br/>\nget by with an older version of DirectX, older video<br/>\ncards are still acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;whole problem here is when Microsoft made a majority<br/>\n&gt;of video cards obsolete with the release of directx<br/>\n&gt;8.. PERIOD...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Argued that one ages ago, not inclined to go back.<br/>\nMicrosoft bashing is easy, Verant chose to push to a<br/>\nhigher hardware/software standard than their customer<br/>\nbase was ready to support, again I point to Origin as<br/>\nan example of what that tends to cause. If anyone<br/>\nrecalls they were among the largest gaming companies<br/>\nin the industry in their heyday, and systematically<br/>\ndestroyed their customer base with increasing hardware<br/>\nrequirements. Sure the games looked great, but only a<br/>\ntenth of the market could play &#39;em. :P<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;problem.  Do you see any other company even<br/>\n&gt;attempting to release a updated DirectX 8 version?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When they have an established customer base, much of<br/>\nwhom are using DX8 incompatable video cards? Nope,<br/>\nVerant appears to be the only one. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You will, however, never see a DirectX 9 version...<br/>\n&gt;Nor will they be supporting the same program 3 years<br/>\n&gt;from now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You seem to forget that a significant portion of the<br/>\nEQ community doesn&#39;t want these &quot;improvements&quot;.<br/>\nGraphically the game was just fine, beyond what was<br/>\nnecessary to get the point across. (of course, i&#39;m the<br/>\ntype who still plays MUDs on occasion :) A few pretty<br/>\nnew graphics do not justify alienating a significant<br/>\nchunk of your customer base. (there was already more<br/>\nthan enough worldspace and &quot;phat l00tz&quot; in game,<br/>\n*VERY* few have explored every nook and cranny of<br/>\nVelious and Kunark, nevermind the original worldspace)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hehe.. Computer technology changes every few<br/>\n&gt;months.. If your still using the same computer you<br/>\n&gt;had 3 years ago, its probably time to upgrade.  Ah<br/>\n&gt;well.. Its Christmas :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lol, well, I personally don&#39;t have any problems<br/>\nmeeting the reqs aside from the RAM and fortunately<br/>\ni&#39;m in a position to fix that. (well, at least once I<br/>\nget my puter back, damn FedEx :( I fail to see why<br/>\nloyal customers of up to three years should be<br/>\npunished for not having an interest in the expansion<br/>\nthough. This is totally ignoring the astounding and<br/>\nabsolutely brutal bugs that still existed after the<br/>\nrelease date, Luclin is a rather shoddy product from<br/>\nthat perspective, and obviously should have been held<br/>\nback a month or two at least. Amusingly enough, it<br/>\nseems like Verant&#39;s own slogan seems to sum up their<br/>\nattitude &quot;You&#39;re in our world now b*tch.&quot; :P<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________ <br/>\nSend your holiday cheer with <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.ca\">http://greetings.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
