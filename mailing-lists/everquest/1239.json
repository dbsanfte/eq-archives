I need to save up my mana. or sorry I&#39;m busy and I need<br/>\n  to save up my mana.<br/>\n  I generally try to say please when I ask for sows or buffs. I&#39;ve asked for<br/>\n  buffs without saying please and then realized I forgot the please and then<br/>\n  add that on in another line.<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m sure this thread has been beaten to death here but<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m going to ask it anyway cuz I&#39;m new to the list :)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I have a 47 druid on Cazic-Thule and, like many of<br/>\n  &gt; you, I get *very* tired of being begged for SoW,<br/>\n  &gt; ports, HP buffs, etc. Also like many of you, I SoW,<br/>\n  &gt; buff, and port newbies and friendly people for free<br/>\n  &gt; whenever I can. I hand out nice weapons and decent<br/>\n  &gt; armor to newbies like they&#39;re candy, and I genuinely<br/>\n  &gt; enjoy helping people (That&#39;s a big reason I chose a<br/>\n  &gt; druid as my main).<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; However, like almost all druids, I have times when<br/>\n  &gt; newbies and/or experienced players come up to me and<br/>\n  &gt; ask for things without saying please or when I&#39;m very<br/>\n  &gt; busy (like for instance the cleric just left the<br/>\n  &gt; group, we haven&#39;t found another healer, my heals blow,<br/>\n  &gt; but I am the primary healer until another is located).<br/>\n  &gt; I have a standard hotkey set up for those who ask for<br/>\n  &gt; SoW or whatever rudely (the &quot;Can I get a SoW&quot; irks me<br/>\n  &gt; no end):<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Beggar: Can I get a SoW?<br/>\n  &gt; Nymue: I&#39;m sorry, I do not comply with rude requests.<br/>\n  &gt; Nymue: Have a nice day!<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; This does not work. They hang around begging, saying<br/>\n  &gt; please, and so on and so forth. One guy told me today,<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Damn druids ruin the game.&quot; Lovely.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; So my poll today is to collect people&#39;s favorite ways<br/>\n  &gt; of denying requests when they don&#39;t want to/don&#39;t have<br/>\n  &gt; the time/are in a group/don&#39;t feel like complying. If<br/>\n  &gt; anyone has an amusing, polite, or snotty reply to<br/>\n  &gt; share with me I&#39;d love to hear it - I&#39;m going to set<br/>\n  &gt; my favorites up as hotkeys, so please don&#39;t share it<br/>\n  &gt; unless you don&#39;t mind me copying it :)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Many thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s assistance,<br/>\n  &gt; Nymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br/>\n  &gt; Lvl 47 Wood Elf Druid<br/>\n  &gt; Cazic-Thule Server<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; =====<br/>\n  &gt; Nymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br/>\n  &gt; Wood Elf Druid, Cazic-Thule Server<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n  &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n  &gt; Yahoo!
