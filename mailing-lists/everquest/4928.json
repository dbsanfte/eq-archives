In game however it could <br/>\nhave appeared so.  The group probably thought you had pulled the <br/>\nbandits intentionally.  There is little you could have done.  As far <br/>\nas training them to zone, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that either as <br/>\nlong as you send a /shout that you have a train coming to the zone <br/>\nline.  As far as what they can do to you, really all they can do is <br/>\nkill steal and say things in /ooc and /shout to other players who <br/>\nmay be grouping with you.  It is unfortunate that things like this <br/>\nhappen, but as long as you explain what happened there&#39;s nothing you <br/>\ncan do.  If you play on Druzzil Ro, and are having problems with <br/>\nthem in-game send a /tell to Jaxum and I&#39;ll see if myself and some <br/>\nguildmates can help you out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Clay&quot; &lt;wolffmanus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I have been playing EQ for about 2 years and enjoying every min. <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; it.
