How long were<br/>\nyou online between talking to the GM and logging out? <br/>\nBecause your petition gets removed from the queue when<br/>\nyou log off your character ... if she was still<br/>\nlooking into it, and you logged, there wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nbeen anything left for her to do because you weren&#39;t<br/>\nonline.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nymue~<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nNymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br/>\nWood Elf Druid, Cazic-Thule Server<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
