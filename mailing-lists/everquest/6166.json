Even as SOEs major flagship game, SOE is seeing <br/>\nthe darkness at the end of the tunnel.  They will be spending more <br/>\nmoney to maintain the game than they are bringing in with <br/>\nsubscriptions dropping more and more each month.  I think SOE &quot;may&quot; <br/>\ntry to revitilize EQ by releasing a completely new graphics engine <br/>\nand serious upgrade for the game, but this would be optional and only <br/>\nbe window dressing since there is not too much they can do with the <br/>\nbackend servers without a complete game overhaul, which they just are <br/>\nnot going to do.  EQ2 was a serious disapointment to them, as the <br/>\nplayers were already use to EQ1 and the social structure there.  It <br/>\ndoes sadden me a bit that EQ will come to a close, but we all knew it <br/>\nwould happen eventually.  I doubt SOE will ever cancel EQ completely <br/>\n(at least not for another 5 or so years), but I would imagine the day <br/>\nwhen new expansion are no longer released, patches are no longer <br/>\nmade, and maybe one or two servers are all that are left is not too <br/>\nfar around the corner.... like I said, maybe 2 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt there will ever be another game that has the same appeal and <br/>\ndrive that SOE captured with EQ1... however I think we might find <br/>\nthat another game may come close only after SOE &quot;pulls the plug&quot; on <br/>\nEQ1 and forces everyone to find another game.  We may see a game in <br/>\nthe future released from SOE along the same genre of EverQuest, but <br/>\nwith a completely different story line and perhaps even the same <br/>\nstayability of EverQuest, but I rather doubt it.  I think SOE will <br/>\nend up making their bread and butter with shoot-offs of the Star Wars <br/>\nUniverse and maybe some other games like they offer on the station <br/>\nwebsite (jeopardy, wheel of fortune, etc), while another game company <br/>\nwith the same spirit that SOE had long ago steps up to take the <br/>\nlead.  I would say the next big game will be Vanguard : Saga of <br/>\nHeros.  I think that Brad and Jeff have both learned a lot from their <br/>\nexperience helping shape EverQuest, and Microsoft (one of the biggest <br/>\nbackers of Sigil) has learned from its mistakes in the online game <br/>\nfield and won&#39;t make the same mistakes again.  SOE has started <br/>\nloosing its grip on the market and Microsoft has a habit of stepping <br/>\nin and taking over when something like that happens.  I mean look at <br/>\nNintendo, Sega, and even Sony.  They started slipping in the console <br/>\ngame industry and Microsoft stepped in with the X-Box and dominated <br/>\nthe market by throwing money at the market till they owned it.  Now <br/>\nthe best graphics for console games out there are on X-Box, even if <br/>\ncontent is still split evenly but leaning more towards X-Box as time <br/>\ngoes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\naka Dragowulf Bowcraft (Ranger of The Tribunal)<br/>\nDulcere the Furryfooted Ranger (Retired Guide of Erollisi Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Oh cool!!<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though.
