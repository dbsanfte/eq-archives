At lvl 13<br/>\nyou&#39;re getting into the level range for Crocs in<br/>\nOasis, just head down there and solo or duo yourself<br/>\nup to 19-20. (groups larger than two people at that<br/>\npoint just slow down the experience gain) Since you&#39;re<br/>\nnew, i&#39;ll give you directions how to get there. Take<br/>\nthe teleport from The Nexus down to West Commonlands,<br/>\ngo east from there to the East Commonlands and ask<br/>\nsomeone to show you where the EC Tunnel is. Go thru<br/>\nthe tunnel turning right at the Shady Swashbuckler<br/>\ninto Northern Desert of Ro. Head to the left til you<br/>\nhit the water and follow the beach to the Oasis of<br/>\nMarr. Continue following the beach til you get to the<br/>\ndocks there, that&#39;s the rest stop in Oasis. Just go<br/>\nfurther down the beach and look for crocs of various<br/>\nlevels to kill. (starting with Crocodiles and Caimans<br/>\non the low end, til Deepwater Crocs on the high end)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you ding 20, head either to *shudder* LOIO (Lake<br/>\nof Ill Omen) on Kunark, or my personal preferance, the<br/>\nKaranas. (Eastern, Northern and Southern Plains of<br/>\nKarana) I&#39;m not too familiar with the Beastlord class,<br/>\nbut as a pet class you shouldn&#39;t have too much<br/>\ndifficulty soloing in the Karanas. You&#39;ll be a little<br/>\nmore likely to find groups in LOIO if that&#39;s what you<br/>\nreally want, but friendly groups? Probably not. LOIO<br/>\nis the haven for all the mouthy thirteen year olds who<br/>\nwant to bicker over the &quot;phat lewt&quot; dropped by a<br/>\nSarnak. It also happens to be the best XP spot in the<br/>\ngame for that level range and there is halfway decent<br/>\ncoin on the MOBs. Pick your poison. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for roleplaying, I can&#39;t speak for FV as a server<br/>\nmyself not having played there. I suppose your best<br/>\nbet is to come up with a good roleplaying<br/>\njustification for people to want to group with you. In<br/>\nterms of simply enjoying the game mechanics though,<br/>\ngrouping with any more than one person before level 20<br/>\nis just going to slow down your progress. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nWeb-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
