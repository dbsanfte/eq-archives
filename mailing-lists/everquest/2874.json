I&#39;ve found people just say &quot;can<br/>\nI have sow&quot;. (now that my druid is able to sow). I had one guy come up and<br/>\nbug me when I was turning in CB belts in Kaladim yesterday. He said &quot;can I<br/>\nhave sow.&quot; I said &quot;I can&#39;t cast that spell indoors&quot;. guy says &quot;What are you<br/>\ngiving him?&quot; me: &quot;Crushbone belts&quot; guy &quot;Can I have sow.&quot;<br/>\nSo I tried to cast it on him just to show it wouldn&#39;t work. then I told him<br/>\nthe message. I was just about to camp. He&#39;s like &quot;ok. tell me when you&#39;re<br/>\nleaving so you can sow me.&quot;<br/>\nI was thinking &quot;would it kill the person to ask if I could go out and sow<br/>\nhim? or to say please?&quot; That has been bothering me lately. Lack of manners.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been casting sow on people before they can ask for it lately. they hail<br/>\nme and I cast it. Just so I won&#39;t have to be angry if they don&#39;t say please.<br/>\nMost of them say thanks at least.<br/>\nanyhoo, I just camped right there and never said another word to the person.<br/>\nI was too tired to deal with it.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
