He was seeking a tailor to make the new 100% weight reduction <br/>\nbags.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him I was a level 80 tailor, and level 70 smith. After not <br/>\nfinding anyone better, he and I went to the Vale Forge to try to make <br/>\nthe Vale Sewing Kit I would need. As getting parts for this kit <br/>\nhappens to be my present goal, I was delighted.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had parts for five tries. In five tries I failed five times, but <br/>\ngained three levels. Not bad for me, but unfortunate for my new <br/>\nfriend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gained also in learning how to get my hq metal bits. I have been <br/>\nseeking the ore, but he suggested reverse-engineering fine steel <br/>\nweapons. He said a fs weapon, flask of water, and chisel can break <br/>\ndown the fs weapon to the component parts. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe suggested Hill Giants in Raith Mountains as a good source of fs <br/>\nweapons to work with. I am nearly leveled enough for that adventure, <br/>\nand so I may direct my efforts to leveling a bit so I may follow this <br/>\nadvice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone know of other good hunting which nets fine steel drops? I <br/>\nexpect that my quest to make my Vale Sewing Kit will raise my <br/>\nexperience and my smithing levels quite nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd about reverse engineering. Anyone know much about this? For <br/>\nexample, I looted a chainmail tunic in Permafrost, but it was too <br/>\nlarge for my alts to use. However, if I could break it down into <br/>\nparts and remake it with the correct pattern for a small character, I <br/>\ncould come out ahead. Any idea if this works?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
