I recieved numerous suggestions, and more support than I ever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expected to get about the matter. But after all I have tried to <br/>\n&gt;accomplish,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it has amounted to nothing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last night, I once again was in a heated debate with Tinysa (even though <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had been informed by a guide that she wouldn&#39;t be on until Thursday <br/>\n&gt;night).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; After lengthy discussion, I was informed that neither my money nor the <br/>\n&gt;Thick<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Banded Belt would be returned to me, as there was no record on the <br/>\n&gt;backup<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tapes of the transaction having ever occured. I was informed after much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; questioning, that ALL COMPLETED trades conducted by players was logged.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Grudgingly, I got Tinysa to admit that it seemed a bit odd that 7500pp <br/>\n&gt;would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simply vanish off a character into thin air. However, I was informed <br/>\n&gt;that it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; did not warrant further investigation because I could have just left the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cash on the ground for someone else to pick up which also would not have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been logged (yeah - as if I&#39;m going to leave 48+ days of savings around <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone to pick up).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Based upon the information I recieved last night, and from the numerous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emails I have recieved from other players about the matter, I have come <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the following conclusion - I believe that the Thick Banded Belt that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bought had indeed been exchanged. However it is my belief that for <br/>\n&gt;whatever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reason, the server detected it as a duplicate, and destroyed it. As <br/>\n&gt;such, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would not have registered as a completed trade, and there for would not <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been logged.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To the best of my knowledge, the GM&#39;s did everything they possibly could <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; verify this information short of restoring the offending character, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; verifying that they did indeed have my 7500pp cash. In fact, they had me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doubting that I had actually conducted the trade until I pulled up the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; screenshot of the trade that I had managed to take a snapshot of, and <br/>\n&gt;looked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at it closely. Based on the screenshot which I myself had taken, I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clearly see the items in question in both trade windows so I know the <br/>\n&gt;trade<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had taken place. I also presented the time and date that it occured<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Date/Time info off of the screenshot) to no avail. In the end, I lost <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; money. I&#39;ll never see it again...... Cheaters 99999..... Good guys<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 0............. I guess it doesn&#39;t pay to be honest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Once again, I stress the fact that I merely present this information to <br/>\n&gt;all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so that you may avoid having this happen to you. This in no way is a <br/>\n&gt;rant,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; flame, gripe, or an attempt to get a thread going about duping/cheating.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unique Valentine gifts, available now at eGroups.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine2</a> &quot;&gt;Click <br/>\n&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Want To Be Showered With Kisses?<br/>\n&gt;Visit eGroups Valentine Gift Guide<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine9\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine9</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
