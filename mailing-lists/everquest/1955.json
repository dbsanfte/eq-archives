I have an<br/>\n1.8Mhz system and most of the game runs slick.  Some zones like the Oasis is<br/>\nreally laggy at times.. (like trying to run through some thick soup) They<br/>\nmention today that there was a bug that caused lag when you had your<br/>\nparticle effects off, of all things.  Not sure what the problem is but give<br/>\nthem a few days to figure it out.. They are still iorning out some of the<br/>\nvisible lag related issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf ya can.. Post more of the equipment you have..
