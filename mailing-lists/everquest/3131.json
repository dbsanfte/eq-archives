I want to be able to go into dungeons for<br/>\nexperience instead of outdoor kiting. One of the characters I would like to<br/>\nbe is a paladin. I have been playing a paladin/magician duo and it seems<br/>\nreally good for dungeon play. I have been looking at necromancers, shaman<br/>\nand druids as well. They all seem to have their strengths and weaknesses.<br/>\nPaladin/Shaman duo seems really good, as the Shaman would be like a third<br/>\ntank. The others would go down fast when swarmed.<br/>\n<br/>\n          Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Your use of Yahoo!
