I am currently <br/>\n&gt; hunting just outside the gate of Misty Thicket. I can handle about <br/>\n&gt; 30% of what I meet, and with care I have not been killed lately.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I cannot find my heading very well, so I am cautious going out too <br/>\n&gt; far. At the gates are deputies to take care of the big stuff, so I <br/>\n&gt; hunt nearby. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know if there is a zone at the other side of Misty <br/>\n&gt; Thicket?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How nasty do things get out there? I don&#39;t expect to take on giant <br/>\n&gt; spiders too soon, but I don&#39;t want to play too timid, either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any advise?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can group with other newbies for short runs, but I don&#39;t have the <br/>\n&gt; time to get a regular group together right now. Can these short term <br/>\n&gt; groups be very useful, or is it better to concentrate on solo stat <br/>\n&gt; building?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Samwiseguy<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
