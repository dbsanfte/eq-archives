I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; working on a new <br/>\n&gt; show for VH1 entitled &quot;My Obsession&quot; It focuses on<br/>\n&gt; pop-culture and <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s effects on society, people, etc.  We are<br/>\n&gt; working on a segment <br/>\n&gt; that highlights people submerged in the world of<br/>\n&gt; Everquest, and I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; looking for possible candidates for the show.  Our<br/>\n&gt; ideal person would <br/>\n&gt; be someone who plays the game<br/>\n&gt; continuously/excessively and has <br/>\n&gt; encountered problems be it family or friends due to<br/>\n&gt; their EQ habits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Side note: This is not meant to be an Everquest<br/>\n&gt; &quot;bashing&quot;<br/>\n&gt; story as so many from the past have been.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Reg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
