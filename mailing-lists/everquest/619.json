I&#39;d hate like hell to see a level cap put on certain <br/>\nitems, and here&#39;s why. I saved every single copper I could, and worked my <br/>\nsmithing skills up just high enough to be able to make a few banded items <br/>\nwith a decent success rate. After saving for weeks, lagging behind in <br/>\nlevels, spending countless hours at the forge, and seeing a lot of good <br/>\nfriends lose interest in EQ, I managed to save up enough to get a steel <br/>\nchestplate. If they impose a level cap on items, then I just may well lose <br/>\nthe ability to wear what took about 2.5 to 3 weeks to save for, and that was <br/>\nafter the month of saving enough cash to work up my smithing skill in the <br/>\nfirst place. I don&#39;t think that it would be fair to lose the ability to <br/>\nwear/wield it after all that. However, on the same note, I don&#39;t think that <br/>\n1st level characters should be wearing mithril and steel either. So where is <br/>\nthe line drawn, where it&#39;s fair for those of us who don&#39;t/didn&#39;t twink, but <br/>\nmanage through legitimate means to get something of great worth and those <br/>\nwho twink? It&#39;s a fine line. And by the way - I&#39;m 14th level.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
