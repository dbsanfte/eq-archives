I take it that, since the Ti <br/>\nis not pci format, the Mx will do alright. I was concerned about the <br/>\nlack of DirectX 8.1 support. The info I have gathered so far <br/>\nindicates that the Mx is built to support DX 7. Anyone know how the <br/>\nlack of 8.1 support might affect the game? Everyone who has come in <br/>\npositive for the Mx has said the frame rates are good enough. What <br/>\nabout other graphics factors?<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone run both the Mx and Ti on the same system? How did they <br/>\ncompare? Since I cannot run the Ti due to lack of pci, what am I <br/>\nmissing? Also, how does the Mx compare to a Gforce2 with the 64 <br/>\nmemory load? Anyone have experience with such?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;justin&quot; &lt;pavisoj@q...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;      I run Direct X 8.1 and have no problems with my GeForce 4 MX <br/>\n440 card on my system. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
