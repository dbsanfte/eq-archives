A friend of mine, level 60 shaman, can easily solo dragons in<br/>\nwestern wastes, not all of them of course, but a couple he can do of the<br/>\neasier ones, I have also seen him solo level 50ish mobs 4 at a time in<br/>\nvarious zones for exp. How does he do it? Well, forget clarity, shaman<br/>\ncannibalise is ALOT better than clarity, and now he just got the<br/>\ncannibalise class skill that came with luclin which gives him about 1750<br/>\nmana for 2000 hitpoints in one single blow, skill is usable every 3<br/>\nminutes.. Pair that up with Torpor and regular cannibalise 4 and you<br/>\nhave endless mana, he can go through 30,000 mana in a couple of minutes<br/>\nwhen buffing a guildraid.. He just Malo&#39;s and slows the mobs, then has<br/>\nhis pet beat on it while he dots and nukes it while tanking it. I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I have ever seen him OOM to this day..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
