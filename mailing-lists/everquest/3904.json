I was playing D&D at the time and when <br/>\nthe story came out all the parents freaked out. We litterally had to <br/>\nhide our D&D stuff from our parents. This is an age old debate <br/>\nwhenther or not violence in TV, games, movies, ect cause violence. <br/>\nPersonally I believe that no they don&#39;t. The problem is already there <br/>\nin the persons mind. Really, think about it. If those mediums did <br/>\ncause it then why don&#39;t we have more people going around squirting <br/>\nothers with water hoses?
