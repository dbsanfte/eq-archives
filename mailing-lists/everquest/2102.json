I would love to go to 512 or more, <br/>\nbut that would require a new system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings have improved with the added memory, but I still get lots of <br/>\nlag in Rivervale, and similar town type zones. My graphics card is an <br/>\nNvidia TNT 64 (don&#39;t know what the 64 means, it is 32meg). It is the <br/>\nbest I could find last year for the money I had, and more than <br/>\nadequate for the game at that time. I needed pci, so my choices were <br/>\na bit limited. More than that, my knowledge was much less in those <br/>\ndays.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious as to what kinds of graphics cards people use, and <br/>\nwhether or not they are experiencing lag in zones like Rivervale in <br/>\nspite of having a pretty good system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have a killer rig, and still find lag or other problems? I <br/>\njust wonder how much is the game, how much my now low end system.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
