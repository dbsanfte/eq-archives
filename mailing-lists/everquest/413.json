What it will do is decrease ping time, which can lessen the impact &gt; of packetloss problems.  The only way to (hopefully) lessen packetloss problems is to try a different ISP (which,<br/>\n&gt; subscribing to a cable modem service, you will accomplish).  The main problem with cable modems, however, is that  &gt;  as more people in your area subscribe to cable modem service, your connection quality will decrease.  This is also     &gt; true for dial up service, but to a far lesser extent since they are low connection speed to begin with.  As I will explain in a &gt; moment, this is not as a real big problem.  DSL, supposedly, does not have this downfall.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s not all that true. You can get rid of the packetloss even if you subscribe to cable modem service within the same ISP. In fact I think cable modem will help you allot. Not only to improve ping times. Since ISPs (mostly) rent higher speed and different routes, at the next wave of ISP or backbone, when they offer their customers higher speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis however kind of depends on how good/serious your ISP is. They should be able to answer you if they have guarantied speed to UUNet, or any of the backbones, the eq servers uses and how many concurrent users using the service.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n <br/>\nMikael Laine / MCSE<br/>\nSystem Engineer<br/>\nExide Nordic<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCheck my Terminal Server site at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://welcome.to/wts\">http://welcome.to/wts</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
