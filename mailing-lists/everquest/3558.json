Granted things","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-172940141\">Woah woah woah.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you mean send it back?<br/>\nIf this is win 2000, you can install the OS to another<br/>\ndirectory just to get into the machine.  Granted<br/>\nthings won&#39;t be installed but you could test whether<br/>\nit is OS related or something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you should be able to uninstall the SP.<br/>\nHowever, if the machine blue screens, then the other<br/>\noption you have it just after starting your machine, I<br/>\nam not sure on the key it might be different but you<br/>\nshould be able to hit F8 every three seconds or so and<br/>\nget a menu.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom that menu you can choose &quot;last known good&quot;, and<br/>\nother options, try things like safe mode or other<br/>\nbasic ones to see if you can get in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you get in, try to uninstall the SP.<br/>\nThis might sound crazy but was the SP the only thing<br/>\nyou installed?  I have seen before where people<br/>\ninstall an SP, then update thier video driver from a<br/>\nsite, only to reboot after both installs.  Then when<br/>\nthe machine does not boot, they point it to the SP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure your level of expertise with computers,<br/>\nso bear in mind I am thinking of the least amount of<br/>\nknowledge with my suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nlet me know if any of this works, before you go<br/>\nshipping it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Steven R.
