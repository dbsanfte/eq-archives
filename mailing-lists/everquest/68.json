Delivering a letter to an undercover temple of thunder operative in the bloodsaber temple down there.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaven&#39;t managed any of those. And the bloodsaber guards kill me as soon as i set foot in the door with 100+ dmg hits. So the undercover thing seems a little hard for me to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJaybay</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
