Yes for the most","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-870997742\"><p>I guess I should restate my position on these. </p>\n<p>1. Since someone is providing them for free, go snag them! Don&#39;t waste the money on ebay.</p>\n<p>2. Yes for the most part they are worthless, however for some newbies they do contain a little info that is nice to know. </p>\n<p>What I am saying here is that for you higher level players they won&#39;t really do you any good except maybe in research for an area you haven&#39;t played yet. For example, I&#39;m currently taking my lvl12 Ranger to Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron because I read in one of the guides that it&#39;s a good place for leveling and loot pays off good. It also gave some good info about the &quot;trains&quot; and other nasties over there that I didn&#39;t know or have found on some of the legit EQ sites. I went over there thinking to myself that I will only stay by the entrance where I can make an escape if needed otherwise I probably would have just skipped my way in there only to get totally creamed! :-) </p>\n<p>Also&nbsp;I am aperson who likes to &quot;earn&quot; his gear and money. Granted&nbsp;I may take an occasional &quot;shortcut&quot; to gaining some plat but that&#39;s only because I really need to. Other than that just playing the game as it is designed to be played does fine. Now if there was a quick and easy way to get a couple of Orc Fibulas to finish my armor quest then let me know! LoL! I can&#39;t find them anywhere! The one thing the defenders of the &quot;cheats&quot; don&#39;t mention and I&#39;m not sure if they have even thought about it is faction. Faction means a lot when dealing with locals. If your a newbie with uber gear you can kick some butt, but you may have a heck of a time dealing with the locals when trying to buy or sell items. </p>\n<p>Either way just have fun and enjoy the game! </p>\n<p>Laters!</p>\n<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Steven R.
