Just thinking<br/>\n&gt; of adding an item or two in the future. You are right, the money<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t be critical until I get closer to my next spell level. Just<br/>\n&gt; wondering if I could do both.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At present I spend part of my time in Velious, getting exp. The other<br/>\n&gt; part I spend in Misty Thicket, foraging Misty Acorns. I have found a<br/>\n&gt; minor money mine there. Running around looking for the ground drops<br/>\n&gt; of acorns is not too productive. Forage, though rare, is better. So,<br/>\n&gt; while I wait for forage to clear, I kill the conveniently grouped<br/>\n&gt; diseased rats. The 1pp tails and a few stackable high-gold items make<br/>\n&gt; the time at least somewhat productive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The present course, until it gets just too boring, is hunt kitties<br/>\n&gt; for one bubble of exp, then off to Misty until I find an acorn. Then<br/>\n&gt; back to Velious for another round.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Starting to feel like a job. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., Rob LeBeau &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What do you need the cash really for? Meaning, if you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; made lots of cash then why not just find a place where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the exp is Excellent.  My attitude is you can always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make money in the higher levels.  Or take up a trade<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like pottery and get your skill up to make things that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sell for good PP.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents...... I have a 32 druid and currently<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hunt in the Overthere and I find the PP good as well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as the exp.  But I am grouping since lots of baddies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resist spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hope this helps<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rob<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- mlockridge01 &lt;MLockridge01@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been hunting Snow Cougars in Iceclad for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level and a half.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The experience is good, and whether solo or duo the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time invested is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the same.
