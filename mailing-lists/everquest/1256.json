If a major item drops, we normally have it go to whomever will use<br/>\nit<br/>\nfirst.  If no one will use it as a primary item, then it is rolled on by the<br/>\ngroup.  We allow people to trade up, when better items drop.  Some days we<br/>\nmight<br/>\nonly see one or two major items drop.  Then other days, we have seen<br/>\nmultiples<br/>\nof items drop and everyone in the party get something good.  It is always<br/>\nthat<br/>\nluck element that decides the quality and quantity.  Nowadays, I am more<br/>\nexperienced oriented and fun oriented than loot oriented.  Most of the<br/>\nplaces I<br/>\ncamp do not drop items that are useable by my class or drop items that are<br/>\nbetter than the items I might already have.  I do not like loot hogs or<br/>\nninja<br/>\nlooters, but I am not really concern about loot as long as the system is<br/>\nfair<br/>\nand everyone understands and agrees to it ahead of the time.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been ages since I been in a group that use alpha loot or loot to X<br/>\nplat<br/>\nor whatever.  Normally, I really like the king looter system, since it<br/>\nallows me<br/>\nto concentrate on supporting the party and getting mana back up.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side bar, what does FFA stand for.  I know I should know it, but I am<br/>\nnot<br/>\nvery good with abbreviations.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom aka Waylorn Dragonsbane, Druid of 58 seasons<br/>\n<br/>\nSu wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems with<br/>\n&gt; loot order.
