Robin Lefler (Ashley Judd in her second appearance on<br/>\nST:TNG-- previously in the episode &quot;Darmok&quot; she played Ensign Lefler) in the<br/>\nepisdoe &quot;The Game&quot;. The director of &quot;Darmok&quot; said in a scifi magazine way<br/>\nback then that Ashley was going &quot;to be a big star&quot; someday.<br/>\nYes, I&#39;m a Star Trek geek. I have a uniform, a phaser, rank pips,<br/>\ncomunicator with sound, and a tricorder. Oh, and I have a tribble. :-)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; If it was like that there&#39;d be more subscribers I<br/>\n&gt; think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lol. True.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, I don&#39;t know any *real* junkies who give up<br/>\n&gt; their horse for EQ horses :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, my horse is a real jerk. He bit my leg and broke the skin just to<br/>\nprove he&#39;s a jerk. So I&#39;d take EQ over my horsie on some days. Would be cool<br/>\nif there were horsies in game that look like him though.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some people have no lives, and if it wasn&#39;t EQ it&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; button collecting, beanie babies and crap.  Just<br/>\n&gt; because they focus their neurotic behavior on EQ<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean EQ caused their neurotic behavior.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly! I was neurotically addicted to TV and internet before EQ. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.544 / Virus Database: 338 - Release Date: 11/25/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
