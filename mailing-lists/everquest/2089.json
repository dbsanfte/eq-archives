Not many play in this zone though. At most I<br/>\nhave seen 10 people when I have played.  In Kelethin,<br/>\nI have seen more than 70.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are more merchants and stuff to get your<br/>\nhands on in Kelething but I hate wandering around the<br/>\ntreetops always running in circles.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I figure once I get the game mechanics down and<br/>\nexperience behind me, I can start another char in<br/>\nKelethin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like you and I would agree on this one,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n--- Spuds McCat &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:spuds@...\">spuds@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Sun, 6 Jan 2002, Minigamer wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or<br/>\n&gt; Loot my corpse?

Meaning, When I went back with a dead<br/>\n&gt; body I died again?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Which meant I found the wrong corpse?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you /consent &lt;Char name&gt; they can MOVE your body,<br/>\n&gt; but on a non-pvp<br/>\n&gt; server they can&#39;t remove anything from your corpse.<br/>\n&gt; on a PVP server rules<br/>\n&gt; are different, and (I think) depends on wether they<br/>\n&gt; killed you or not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now?<br/>\n&gt; seeing as I have no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; food, no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I beg or do I<br/>\n&gt; start another char? This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to<br/>\n&gt; learn which way to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all the time and dying, it is starting to get to<br/>\n&gt; me, I don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give up just yet and I turned to this board since<br/>\n&gt; the Chat from the game<br/>\n&gt; &gt; options was USELESS.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is a personal choice, can keep on going, or<br/>\n&gt; start over.  The zone<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re in is IMHO hard to learn since so few<br/>\n&gt; landmarks, but many people<br/>\n&gt; feel is the best starting zone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Corpse decay:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; for a nude body, it&#39;ll decay (vanish) in 5 minutes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; for a low level char (think below 20?) body with<br/>\n&gt; items will decay in 30<br/>\n&gt; minutes of online time(i.e. if logged in to game),<br/>\n&gt; or 24 hours if not<br/>\n&gt; logged in (EQ not running on your machine)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; for a high level char (20+) body with items will<br/>\n&gt; decay in something like<br/>\n&gt; 24 hours online, or 1 week offline.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; note that &#39;online&#39; includes time logged in as other<br/>\n&gt; chars, and reportadly<br/>\n&gt; even if in chat server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There have been rumors that after corpse decay items<br/>\n&gt; stick around slightly<br/>\n&gt; longer(and could be picked up by anyone) but I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never heard of this<br/>\n&gt; actually happening, and I&#39;ve seen many a corpse<br/>\n&gt; decay, so I don&#39;t belive<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s true.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
