Hell, it&#39;s even hard when you are in a guild. I&#39;m one of the<br/>\nleaders in a guild that has 150+ members and most are 50+, however, you will<br/>\nnotice problems when you get higher and you&#39;ve noticed that EQ ain&#39;t that<br/>\nfun. You wanna do the real stuff like dragons, planes and more &quot;uber&quot; stuff.<br/>\nThat&#39;s when guilds comes handy. At lower levels it&#39;s more like a community,<br/>\nbut still great tho, you will get to know alot more people via your guild<br/>\nand hopefully you will join a good guild. As for me, i like to chat with<br/>\nfolks all the time, i wouldnt manage to stick to EQ (already hard as it is<br/>\nwith AO this close) without a guild.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tMaster Charrick [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mastercharrick@...\">mastercharrick@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, June 20, 2001 4:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EverQuest] Guilds vs. Solo<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have seen a lot of people with guild names on my server and I was really<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wondering what the benefit of being in a guild would be to going it<br/>\n&gt; without <br/>\n&gt; one???<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I mean I can always find someone to group with... or solo it on the blue&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and blacks....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Other then maybe another aspect added to the role playing game what<br/>\n&gt; benefit <br/>\n&gt; do you recieve from a Guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ok got to run just wondering<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
