Besides being an officer<br/>\non a local and Kingdome level I am also heavily into the lighter weapons<br/>\naspect of the period (Rapier) and am doing my best to have a nice Rapier<br/>\nmelee unit  ready for a week long event  in Lumberton, MS set in March Known<br/>\nas Gulf Wars.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut as Jenn said the SCA is one of the best clubs around to teach and learn<br/>\nabout  the Middle Ages.  Being able to &quot;live&quot;  in the time period is fun.<br/>\nNot to mention the various cultures that were prevalent  during that era<br/>\nthat you can choose from.  Mongol, Welsh Scots, Irish Japanese, German,<br/>\nItalian, French.  Basically any culture that is documentable  and had some<br/>\nkind of proven contact with Middle Ages Europe is available for you to<br/>\nchoose from.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically an entire cornucopia of knowledge can be had<br/>\n<br/>\nKwasi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jenn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:juniper.jot@...\">juniper.jot@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, August 04, 2002 1216<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Re: SCA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 8<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Sat, 3 Aug 2002 19:29:40 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 550<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What is SCA?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Society for Creative Anachronism  Medieval re-creation group dedicated<br/>\n&gt; to education about the middle ages. Check out www.sca.org for more info<br/>\n&gt; than you can ever take in and understand.  It&#39;s more than the<br/>\n&gt; description tho, it&#39;s a family of close friends who will usually do<br/>\n&gt; anything for each other.  It&#39;s camping trips where you dress in medieval<br/>\n&gt; clothes for up to 2 weeks, don&#39;t ever call the clothing a costume, we<br/>\n&gt; call it garb.  How do you explain SCA?  It&#39;s teaching leadership and<br/>\n&gt; respect for elders to our children.  It&#39;s awarding the hard work and<br/>\n&gt; dedication of all the people who put the events together so we can have<br/>\n&gt; fun.  It&#39;s learning how to do medieval cooking, sewing, felting,<br/>\n&gt; drumming, knitting chainmail, dancing, pounding out armor, just for the<br/>\n&gt; fun of learning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So much more too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
