It will happen someday. Here let<br>me tell you my story and see if you feel any better ok? <br><br>Back in 1988 I met this girl going to the local Jr. college in the town<br>I was living in. I was a senior in high school and we really hit it off.<br>I&#39;ll call her &quot;K&quot;, K and I were always together and I soon fell madly in<br>love with her. Soon the school year came to a close, things were<br>changing a little for us, I actually cut my waist long hair so her<br>parents wouldn&#39;t freak! Yea, I really liked her! <br>Well after she moved back to Denver I got a phone call from her. She<br>wanted to break up and see other people. Of course I was devastated,<br>(I&#39;m one of those sappy sensitive types), and it was hard. I agreed<br>because I really didn&#39;t have the experience in relationships to try and<br>work something out. Well two weeks pass and my graduation came. K shows<br>up to go to my graduation, which was cool and all but the night before<br>we get into this nasty fight. We&#39;re cruising along and there is a truck<br>full of some of my female friends fom school and they are drunk off<br>their ass! They&#39;re whopin&#39; and hollarin&#39; having a good ol&#39; time. Well K<br>suddenly jumps out of the passenger seat and practically into my lap.<br>&quot;Don&#39;t look at them.&quot; She says to me as she entwines her arm in mine.<br>&quot;Excuse me? You broke up with me remember?&quot; I said back to her, &quot;I can<br>look at whomever I want!&quot; granted it probably wasn&#39;t the most mature way<br>to put it but either way we ended up into a fight. So we came home and<br>went to bed. (I left a bunch of non-important stuff out to save time,<br>btw nothing happened.)<br>The next morning I woke up before she did. I was lying there looking at<br>her and thinking this will be the last time we see each other. So I<br>stroke her arm ans she wakes up. We start to kiss and one thing leads to<br>another. It was my first time mind you so I was really nervous about<br>that and to top it off, my Mother was asleep in the next room! So<br>afterwards I ask the usual guy question, of &quot;How was I&quot; and her response<br>was &quot;I&#39;ve had bigger.&quot; SMAK! Oh that hurt! I was destroyed, whether or<br>not it was true, (My wife says she&#39;s full of crap!), it really hurt.<br>This began a 7 year drought for me. I completely shut myself off. I<br>didn&#39;t date, never went out, got into stamp collecting. ;D Man it was<br>rough! So finally to make an incredibly long story a little shorter I<br>finally got back into the dating scene. I put an ad out on<br>coloradosingles.com which was a great site because I&#39;ll never meet<br>someone say in Pennsylvania! I don&#39;t suggest going to that site now<br>because they are now a &quot;swinger&#39;s&quot; site, unless of course your into<br>that. :-)<br>So now you know that love can happen but it just takes time. Hey are you<br>going to the Denver Everquest Meetup? <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.meetup.com/\">http://everquest.meetup.com/</a> I&#39;m<br>going to meet some fellow CO Eqer&#39;s.

I have known several friends who either gave up or <br>were never looking who were most pleasantly surprised.
