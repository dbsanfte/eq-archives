I managed to <br>force my hef rgr to lvl 18/19--18 is where I spend most of my time, <br>but sometimes I lvl to 19. <br><br>I have been recently been building my fletching skills(104). I spent <br>about 4hrs a day hunting in front of Qeynos killing green mobs for <br>about 3wks. All I make is about 150plat in the 4 hrs with no exp, but <br>when I go hunting elswere--like bb--I only get about 5 plat for 4 hrs <br>and some exp. I seem to go up about 2 skill points in that time in <br>front of Qeynos. <br><br>I don&#39;t mean to complain, but I am starting to feel sorry for all <br>knolls and gopher snakes I&#39;ve killed. Plus I would like to be able to <br>do more quests.<br><br>I do want to earn everything myself, but would like to know where I <br>can earn some serious plat? I have heard of people lvl 12\n earning 4-<br>5000 plat/hr. <br><br>How do they do that?<br><br>Anyone have any suggestions?<br><br>Thanks<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com/\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1027218776a\">\n&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1027218776b\" style=\"visibility:hidden;\">\n</div>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n</style><p>\n\t\t<hr size=\"1\">Do you Yahoo!?<br> \nYahoo!
