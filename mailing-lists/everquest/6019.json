Thankfully most tanks I have \ngrouped with learn very fast how to get it back from her, also I&#39;ve become quite \ngood at pulling mobs off her onto me till tank gets aggro again (or wants \naggro.)&nbsp; I&#39;ve even kept one spell slot for my best heal so I can fire off \nsome quick rounds her way to keep her from getting low health aggro.&nbsp; Not \nto say shes an aggro magnet, but she has learned how to kite mobs with her \nchanter till either I or the tank can get it more upset with us again, although \nlately shes gotten better at using that Rune shield to keep herself from getting \nhit till we get its attention.&nbsp; Usually if the tanks a warrior thanks to \nthose new disicplines she doesnt draw as much aggro and paladins have those stun \nspells that really work well.&nbsp; Had rangers tank a few times but they really \ndidnt seem to do as well on aggro management (but the one that tanked for us on \nseveral occasions is teamed with a druid and they usually kite mobs.)&nbsp; My \nchanter friend and I have duoed a few areas for xp, using her slows and such \nwith my pet tanking and me on heals (yes my gimpy little beast heals...not like \nshes got tons of HPs anyway *smile*) and done very well in older zones, but if \nwe try the newer zones (GoD, OoW) then we need a good healer.&nbsp; One thing to \nremember, try to make some friends who play same times you do and try to work \ninto a regular group, had so many times our group was saved by her remaining \ncool under powerful attacks and getting them mezzed followed by me pulling them \noff her (once we were accused of being a hydra team.)&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen bad tanks \nand super tanks, some bad tanks I even knew weren&#39;t really bad tanks, they just \nhad someone in the group used to a tank with higher aggro abilities (he had \ndecided the tank was worthless since he didnt own some expensive weapon with \nmega aggro ability...like everyone has dozens of K of plat just waiting to be \nspent.)&nbsp; We found really quick all we had to do was delay how often we used \nour abilities and tanks would often be able to&nbsp;keep the aggro better (but \nthen again was one tank who not only couldnt keep aggro well the chanter made a \nbetter tank than he did.)&nbsp; As for aggro magnets...chanter friend of mine is \nfinally losing her &quot;group sacifice&quot; title since I&#39;m now better at getting them \noff her till tank gets them again.&nbsp; Mean time my beast is now quickly \nbecoming a tank himself, but dont count on the cleric or druid having much mana \nwhen done...beasts are not really ment for damage input, just damage output \n))</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <table id=\"ygrps-yiv-1694722383INCREDIMAINTABLE\" cellSpacing=\"0\" cellPadding=\"2\" width=\"100%\"\n border=\"0\"><tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"ygrps-yiv-1694722383INCREDITEXTREGION\"\n style=\"FONT-SIZE:12pt;CURSOR:auto;FONT-FAMILY:Arial;\" width=\"100%\">\n        <div>it&#39;s getting so pitiful with some wars when&nbsp;I&#39;m playing my \n        chanter i stand right next to them to cast at least that way they don&#39;t \n        have to chase the mob to taunt it all they have to do is turn a little, \n        and as I&#39;m usually grouped with guildies the healer already has me on \n        target when they pull.... and it&#39;s getting so&nbsp;I&#39;ll only group in \n        BoT when&nbsp;I&#39;m on my beast&nbsp;with a healer i know cause&nbsp;half \n        the time&nbsp;if I&#39;m using Sha&#39;s Revenge I&#39;m going to get my behind \n        kicked till the tank can get it off me.
