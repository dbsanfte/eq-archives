I no longer have a Voodoo card, so was unsure if they released a driver that worked.  I didn&#39;t want anyone with a Voodoo to buy DAoC on my advice and not be able to run it.  As we are all on a budget (or have no money if still in high school or college), it not good to buy something you can&#39;t use.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for why I bought Luclin, I guess due to my friends that tried DAoC and returned to EQ.  As you found, DAoC was not for them.  I have been playing with the same group of folks since I started EQ 2.5 years ago.  We all went to the Orlando Fan Faire together in October.  We met 4 other folks (guild brothers) from Maine and other places there face to face for the first time since meeting them 1.5 years ago on The Nameless.  I miss my friends.  So even if I am not playing it, EQ is still a part of my life I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, I am still having a blast in DAoC.  My guild there, Mithril Hammer, Midgard, Gawaine Server, went to the frontier last night for some realm vs. realm combat.  We had a running battle going there for over 3 hours!  And this was no camp or wait for a spawn.  It was a constant battle of people vs. people and all the variety that represents.  50 folks vs. 50 folks.  Attack, pull back, flank, up the hill, retreat, res him quick, get that damn caster - it was sweet!  My only regret is I am the typical family player (dad, 2 daughters, wife, holidays, work, sleep deprivation, blah, blah) so I was probably the lowest PC there due to my limited time on line - all the enemy was purple (much higher than me).  However, as a Skald, I still can be value added to the group and I feel like I really made a difference last night.  Everyone was disappointed when I had to leave.  I stayed up much later than I planned, but EQ does that too at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough of this.  This is after all an EQ list.  Thanks for being patient and listening.  Enjoy whatever game tickles your fancy.  I hope Santa brings everyone a 256 mb stick of Ram and a new video card for Christmas, lol.  Back to lurking again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy holidays all,<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cook Miller-ETOP03&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:etop03@...\">etop03@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 17, 2001 12:54 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] SoL alternative<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; But I am still not playing EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust curious, but why did you even buy SOL?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Voodoo cards do not work though<br/>\n<br/>\nNot true, at least for the Voodoo 5.
