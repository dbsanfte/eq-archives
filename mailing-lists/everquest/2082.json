It&#39;s NOT possible for others to loot<br/>\nor drag your corpse unless you give them permission using the /consent<br/>\ncommand.<br/>\n<br/>\n  More likely what&#39;s happened is that your corpse is inside a tree or object<br/>\nor even slightly underground.  If you have the /loc where you died, stand<br/>\nthere and use the /corpse command which will summon it to you (if you&#39;re<br/>\nclose enough).  If you don&#39;t know where it is, try gaining the help of a<br/>\nnecromancer or bard, they have the ability to locate corpses.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You can also buy a Chipped Bone Rod in Felwithe (I don&#39;t remember which<br/>\nshop, sorry), when used, this item will point you towards the closest corpse<br/>\nyou have in the zone you&#39;re in.  You can then run in that direction until<br/>\nyou get close enough to summon it with /corpse.<br/>\n    ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n    From: Minigamer<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n    Sent: Sunday, January 06, 2002 7:39 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [EverQuest] Serious Everquest question, please help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\n    Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th level Druid in the city<br/>\nof Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, with others, I got killed by an Orc<br/>\nCenturian and when I returned to get my corpse, nothing was there.  It was<br/>\nnot more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my corpse? The<br/>\nbook says no but I beg to differ.<br/>\n    Is it possible that I had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I went<br/>\nback with a dead body I died again?  Which meant I found the wrong corpse?<br/>\n<br/>\n    And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have no<br/>\nfood, no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I beg or do I start another char?<br/>\n    This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to learn which way<br/>\nto go all the time and dying, it is starting to get to me,<br/>\n    I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since the<br/>\nChat from the game options was USELESS.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\n    Rob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
