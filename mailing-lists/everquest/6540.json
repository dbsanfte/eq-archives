They said there was a free or trial download so I could <br/>\ngive it a try this weekend. I thought what a perfect opportunity to <br/>\ntry it while I have a couple of days off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, my problem is that I don&#39;t know what site to download the game <br/>\nfrom or what version. I mean there is a Everquest 2 and there are 7 <br/>\nday trials and a 30 day one but only if you are on a certain server <br/>\netc. I&#39;m so confused and I haven&#39;t even started the game...lol. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if anyone knows of the best site to download from I&#39;d really <br/>\nappreciate it. I can&#39;t call my co-workers since I dont know their <br/>\nphone numbers off hand. I guess I&#39;d like to be able to have the <br/>\ndownload from a place that has several servers so I can find my co-<br/>\nworkers on there when I see them next. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh by the way I&#39;m not sure if this makes a difference when <br/>\ndownloading etc. but after talking with my co-workers about <br/>\ncharacters/classes etc. I decided I would like to be an Elf :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a bunch in advance for all of your help and hope to see you <br/>\nplaying Everquest soon!<br/>\n<br/>\nthx,<br/>\n<br/>\nRamona</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
