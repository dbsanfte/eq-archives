I guarantee one,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be in one of these pick up groups and a good item will drop and an<br/>\nargument will start. The only way around this is to only group with friends<br/>\nwhom you trust or join a good guild. Everybody does not think the same way<br/>\nyou or I might think. You might think need before greed. But sure enough, a<br/>\ncaster item will drop and the Monk, Rogue or what ever will insist on full<br/>\nrandom. It happens all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think you can just solo and never need a group, that is fine also.<br/>\nBut you will never see some of the great zones and dungeons in the game<br/>\nwithout a guild or a group. Going to the Planes or Armor quest dungeons, you<br/>\nwant to be in a good, well organized guild. I am not saying by any means<br/>\nyou&#39;ll never get some great items by soloing or in pickup groups, you can<br/>\nget you fair share of loot, but it&#39;ll be at the cost of many headaches if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t find some regular friends or a guild to stick with.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuilds have many advantages. In my guild, we hand down items once we get<br/>\nbetter items or sell them to a guild mate for like half the cost of the<br/>\ncurrent market. My warrior has Thurg armor and I handed down all my stuff,<br/>\nCobalt gloves, Hammerhead Helm, Kylong legs & 2 cheep bracers. We keep it<br/>\nall in our family. My guild mate gave me 5k for the gloves, 5k for the legs<br/>\nand 6k for the HHH. When I got my quest armor, not only did that make me a<br/>\nstronger warrior, but it also made some of my guild members stronger, and<br/>\nthus my guild is stronger. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother guild advantage is the guild chat handle. If you have every tried to<br/>\nraid Kael with your guild of 2 - 3 groups and there is already another raid<br/>\ngoing on in Kael. While the other raids are using the /shout & /ooc chat<br/>\nhandles, you and your guild can use the guild handle. Believe me, Kael can<br/>\nbe as bad as GFay if they are 3-4 groups there and all you see is the<br/>\nfollowing:<br/>\n/shout Incoming giant xxxxx<br/>\n/ooc giant xxxxx is tash&#39;d<br/>\n/shout giant xxxxx is snared<br/>\n/shout Incoming giant yyyyy<br/>\n/ooc giant zzzzz is malo&#39;d<br/>\n/ooc giant yyyyy is malo&#39;d<br/>\n/ooc giant xxxxx is slowed<br/>\n/shout giant yyyyy is snared<br/>\n/shout Silk arms, all casters give me a tell now if you want to roll<br/>\n/ooc giant zzzzz is slowed<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me, it is great to go there and only have to look at my guild chat<br/>\nto see what is incoming, slowed or what just dropped. Maybe it is just me,<br/>\nbut there is A LOT of advantages to belonging to a guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for all the rambling!<br/>\n<br/>\njeff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tMaster Charrick [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mastercharrick@...\">mastercharrick@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tWednesday, June 20, 2001 9:47 AM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\t[EverQuest] Guilds vs. Solo<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have seen a lot of people with guild names on my server and I was<br/>\nreally <br/>\n\twondering what the benefit of being in a guild would be to going it<br/>\nwithout <br/>\n\tone???<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI mean I can always find someone to group with... or solo it on the<br/>\nblue&#39;s <br/>\n\tand blacks....<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOther then maybe another aspect added to the role playing game what<br/>\nbenefit <br/>\n\tdo you recieve from a Guild.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tok got to run just wondering<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t_________________________________________________________________<br/>\n\tGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n\t <br/>\n<br/>\n\tYour use of Yahoo!
