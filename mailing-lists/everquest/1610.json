If you know how much money some \npeople have made on just ebaying legit loot then you can figure out how much \nthey can make from spreading a simple EQ virus to gain access to hundreds of \naccounts(I&#39;ve had one guildmate this year that had a virus like that, she ended \nup being banned).. They get your account info, ebay all tradable loot then they \nsell the account itself.. Unfortunately the buyer is screwed since the real \nowner will report the theft most likely.. But the virus programmer still makes a \nbundle.. :(</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-868540241880251117-15062001\"></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote>\n  <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-868540241OutlookMessageHeader\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"\n size=\"2\">-----Ursprungligt meddelande-----<br><b>Fr�n:</b> Lance Whitmore \n  [mailto:vesuvus@...]<br><b>Skickat:</b> den 15 juni 2001 \n  16:15<br><b>Till:</b> EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br><b>�mne:</b> Re: SV: SV: \n  [EverQuest] Verant&#39;s new security policy..<br><br></font></div>\n  <p><em>Ok I had never thought about getting my account &quot;hacked&quot; into. &nbsp;I \n  would have <br>thought that as long as I didn&#39;t give out my information that I \n  would be <br>safe.</em></p>\n  <p>That&#39;s cause you are safe..&nbsp; The odds of anyone hacking your system.. \n  or anyone else&#39;s system just to get your everquest account is next to \n  nothing.&nbsp; Sure it happens every now and then due to the lack of players \n  realizing their personal responsibility to protect themselves on the \n  Internet.&nbsp; If your handing your account information out to other \n  players/not running uptodate anti-virus programs/personal firewalls/etc. \n  then&nbsp;they have no one to blame but themselves.&nbsp; There&#39;s certainly \n  more personal information about them that would be more important \n  to&nbsp;&quot;hackers&quot; other then your Everquest account.&nbsp; Those protection \n  programs are easy to install and maintain - most are automatic with the least \n  amount of input from the end-user.&nbsp; If someone is &quot;sniffing&quot; the packets \n  from your computer, you&#39;ve got a much larger problem then worrying if they \n  have compromised your EQ account.</p>\n  <p>D.</p>\n  <p><br>\n  <hr SIZE=\"1\">\n  <b>Do You Yahoo!?</b><br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://personal.mail.yahoo.com/?.refer=mailiyfoot\">Yahoo!
