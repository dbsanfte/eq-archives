A possible solution is the &quot;sewing<br/>\nneedles for Willamina&quot; quest. Talk to Willamina (loc neg 415, pos 1160), and<br/>\nshe sends you off on a Fed Ex quest involving 9 other NPCs, all in PoK.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou finally get a book from her that, in addition to some minor stats, also<br/>\ncontains something called a &quot;faction modifier&quot;, which I am assuming modifies<br/>\nPoK faction to the point that others will give you quests, i.e. continue<br/>\ntheir conversations further.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have written down the names and locs of all the NPCs, if you want them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 19, 2002 1:22 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Plane of Knowledge NPC&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have been exploring the pok for my last two sessions. Had a bit of<br/>\n&gt; a break between sessions due to having no power for most of a week.<br/>\n&gt; Quite a storm here in the Central Coast district of California.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In talking with many NPC&#39;s I found them giving me about a paragraph<br/>\n&gt; of monologue, breaking at a point which indicates more to come.<br/>\n&gt; However, few have the &quot;continue&quot; command attached. Anyone know how to<br/>\n&gt; get the whole monologue from these NPC&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tried increasing the size of my dialogue box, but had no success.<br/>\n&gt; Now I did have two boxes open, side by side, and only tried adding<br/>\n&gt; length to the box in which the NPC&#39;s were talking. I may try a wider,<br/>\n&gt; longer box next time. Anyone have any experience in pok with this<br/>\n&gt; problem?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
