What really made<br/>\nthe difference for me was the addition of a new vid card. I picked up an<br/>\nnVidia 5500 at Wal*Mart for $120 and it was well worth the investment.

I<br/>\nhave 1gb ram, with an amd processor ( running win 2000 ) lol i was cheap,<br/>\nbut it works. However I am on dialup, as there isnt anything faster or<br/>\nbetter in my area yet, tho i hear wi-fi is coming so....&lt;crossing fingers&gt;.<br/>\nThe huige wait tho, sometimes longer than the actual loading, is zoning into<br/>\nPoK. It is is horribley long wait...worse if the character i want to play is<br/>\ncamped there...so until there is a change..I seldom go there now ort camp<br/>\nthere. I have a pocket cleric and chanter to temp/ virtue and kei, me in<br/>\nnexus, so al is good.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Tho I do have an issue with PoK..am I the only one that has to run around<br/>\nPoK loking at their feet and suing the map so not to run into stuff? The lag<br/>\nthere, most times ( early morn seems to be best) is very bad...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
