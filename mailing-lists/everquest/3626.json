Right now I only have 256mb (Samsung DDR333 PC2700) of memory, but I plan to increase that in the next few weeks. It came stock with a Chaintech GF2 MX400 64MB agp card which runs quite well. Surprised me a bit because my older system also has a GF2 MX400 in it, but runs soooo much slower, possibly because it&#39;s a pci card I suppose. Bus speed is still at the norm 100..possibly 133 but I don&#39;t think so. It&#39;s an Asus P4S533 Mobo with the SiS 645dx chipset that has gotten quite good reviews. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed spell effects drag down my fps quite a bit, but still quite playable. In a raid situation I would probably turn them off. The bazaar is a little laggy if I don&#39;t have the clip plane down, altho if I only have the old character models enabled I can set the clip plane to about 50% before I get bad lag. All this, I&#39;m assuming, is because of the video card limitations. Quite probably it is your problem (mostly) as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nScanning through Pricewatch.com I noticed some pretty good prices on the GF3 ti200 and ti500. So I will likely be going with that....but then again the GF5s should be coming out within the next few weeks (according to a magazine article I read) I think, and the prices should fall even further...<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: Rob LeBeau &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">rlebeau65@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: RE: Network setup help<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;hey can I ask if you have Luclin and use the new ui?<br/>\n&gt;If so, can you tell me the Amount of Ram in the<br/>\n&gt;system, the video ram, and the bus speed if you happen<br/>\n&gt;to know it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;the reason I ask is I bought a new machine Intel<br/>\n&gt;Celeron 1.2Ghz processor with over 300 MB ram and<br/>\n&gt;Nvidia 32MB ram card. The game runs ok but I can&#39;t use<br/>\n&gt;the new UI else I get Mouse lag or hesitation like<br/>\n&gt;MAD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And when spells are cast, the mouse is VERY slow.<br/>\n&gt;the graphics are fine though and actually run smooth.<br/>\n&gt;I have about 15 Luclin graphic images turned on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let me know<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYour favorite stores, helpful shopping tools and great gift ideas.
