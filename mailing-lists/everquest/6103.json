I used to be on dialup but my phonelines kept deteriorating. When the bandwidth dropped under 10k we had to get satellite. Once when it was raining and lost satellite I dialed up but was only at 6.2k. On a later attempt the bandwidth was too low to even dialup at all. The phone company denies there is anything wrong with the lines so we can&#39;t get them to do anythign about it. So we are completely on satellite now. It&#39;s supposed to be about 800k dl speed and 50k upload. However, they tend to cap usage if you load more than a certain amount. Because of the delay with the satellite signal I get over 800ms ping. I pretty much average around 3kms. It makes things tough in WoW, but it&#39;s still doable. Death in WoW is easier to deal with than death in EQ. I kinda wish EQ would change it so you no longer lost xp on death, but I doubt they will. I would be willing to sacrifice some cash for armor repair or such <br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n====== At 2005-03-02, 02:42:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;DOH!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Umm......
