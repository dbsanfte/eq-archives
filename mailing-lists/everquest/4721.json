We all start new toons and only play them once a <br/>\nweek <br/>\n&gt; on game night unless you miss a night and need to make up lvs. <br/>\n&gt;    Any server or server type is good to me PVP, PVE, or blue , Even <br/>\n&gt; blue and we follow discord.  We could all play one type of toon <br/>\n&gt; (beastlords or mages) or shoot for balnce or all iskar some thing <br/>\n&gt; like that.
