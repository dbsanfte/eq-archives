I felt like my character <br/>\nwas swimming in really thick jello. I looked around and noticed a lot of <br/>\npeople with their faces to the walk. Were they being punished? Hehehe. I <br/>\nwondered how I could sell anything. I didn&#39;t know that I needed a trader&#39;s <br/>\nsatchel yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn time my video card blew. I had to use the on-board video from my main <br/>\nboard. Needless to say, the graphics capability lacked a lot. My character <br/>\nis a Val Shir. The main board video chip wasn&#39;t capable of handling the <br/>\npolygons for clothing. All of the female kitty dancers at the campfire in <br/>\nThicket were completely nude. I sat down in from to the white tigress for <br/>\nabout 10 minutes and watched her dance. The dances were short but very <br/>\nentertaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdward Fox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
