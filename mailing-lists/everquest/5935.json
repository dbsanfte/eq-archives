So keep that in mind when building your system, you might need a larger power supply or else the system shuts itself off and has other problems. My father found this out the hard way when he ordered a new PC from HP. They put in the GeForce 5 but did not increase the power supply so he had to go buy a new power supply in order for his computer to work.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======== At 2004-11-19, 11:15:00 you wrote: ========<br/>\n<br/>\nMy system specs are a Pentium 4 1.8Ghz and a 400mhz FSB  with 1024MB of RAM and a 128MB ATI Radeon 9200 video card.

I expect good things from it when I&#39;m done.   I think EQ2 should run quite nicely on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWulfric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
