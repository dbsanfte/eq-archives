I&#39;m having some trouble and need advice on the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) I am &quot;solo&quot;-ing bandits in Western Karana for the xp and <br/>\nsashes.  I am pulling one or two at time and most con white or dark <br/>\nblue to me.  The problem is the bandit casters that con dark blue <br/>\nare kicking my butt.  Any Advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) I am trying to procure a perfect quality bear skin for the cape <br/>\nquest.  I took about 25 brown and grizzly bears last night, and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get a single one.  Any advice on which drops them more <br/>\nfrequently or how rare they are?<br/>\n<br/>\n3.) Finally, what are there yellow and red cons that I may be able <br/>\nto take down at this level?  I am extremely anxious to reach the <br/>\n15th season and get my dual wield.  I have pretty decent gear <br/>\ncourtesy of my guild-mates.  Any pointers would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  I am particularly interested in taking down the werewolf that <br/>\nroams WK.  He&#39;s snuck up on me and offed me 3 times now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance,<br/>\nJaxun</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
