I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2042277926\">HI everyone,<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading this list but havent posted before.<br/>\nI have a 51 warrior and a 44 druid. I am currently working on leveling my 31<br/>\ncleric. I mainly have her to help my guild with rezzes. Otherwise my warrior<br/>\nis my favorite. I&#39;ve been playing a little over a year.<br/>\nI agree with you Barto on the lag in the baazar. I cant move or get my mouse<br/>\nto work either. I actually walk in there frame by frame and I have a very<br/>\nupgraded computer. I&#39;m not doing any selling or buying but my husband does<br/>\nsell a lot, so of course I had to go check it out. I&#39;ve turned my clip plane<br/>\nalmost all the way down and look down a little. thats help me move some. I<br/>\nalso found because the lag is so bad that people have been doing a lot of<br/>\nselling out in the spires.<br/>\nHow does everyone feel about the new interface? I&#39;m having a hard time<br/>\ngetting use to it, like someone else said I too am having a problem with the<br/>\nchat box on the bottom, I&#39;ve been moving it to the top and faded it so there<br/>\nis no background. It makes it easier to target. What I dont like is that we<br/>\ncant see ourselves anymore. What I mean is in the other interface when I am<br/>\nrunning I could see behind me when I clicked on the inventory, but now we<br/>\ncant do that anymore. All in all I like this new look and the many options<br/>\nits given us.<br/>\nHope to talk more soon.<br/>\nDoneka Pullemall<br/>\n51 warrior<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 27 Jul 2002 01:35:06 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;mlockridge01&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: bazaar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Went there this morning to set up some sales. Lag was terrible. It<br/>\n&gt; was hard to even get my cursor on target. I suppose it will be ok<br/>\n&gt; once I get set up to sell, but the set up is terrible. Move cursor.<br/>\n&gt; Not on object. Move a bit more. Not on object. Move back. Click.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t have object. Click again. Hmph. Had object but didn&#39;t know it,<br/>\n&gt; and just put it back. Click...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Took so long that I didn&#39;t finish setting up before I had to log. I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have logged if I could have left my toon to do business<br/>\n&gt; while I was gone, but no such luck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just gotta get another machine, faster connection, and retire from<br/>\n&gt; my job so that I can play all the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
