PCI. I have seen the gforce 2<br/>\n&gt;for about $45. I am wondering if I can expect much improved<br/>\n&gt;performance with the gforce 2. Both are pci, both 32k. I get lots of<br/>\n&gt;lag in Rivervale, most of Luclin, and some of the other cities. Not<br/>\n&gt;everywhere, just where lots of people gather and the backgrounds are<br/>\n&gt;graphics intensive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t have the money to go for the gforce 3, and I don&#39;t even know<br/>\n&gt;if the 3 comes in pci format. I need another hard disk as well as<br/>\n&gt;doing a graphics upgrade, so the money needs to stay around that $45.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would want a very obvious improvement to even bother with the<br/>\n&gt;upgrade on the graphics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;Zeb server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
