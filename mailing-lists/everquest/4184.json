Just read Thinking Out Loud, and one point I failed <br/>\nto see as a hurdle for EQ and EQ style games moving to consoles is <br/>\nthe difference in gaming philosophy the two camps still hold. Console <br/>\ngamers play by themselves, or with up to four others in the same <br/>\nroom. Interaction in the game, and cooperation to achieve goals, is <br/>\njust not part of the console experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe social aspect of EQ is boring and a burden to finger twitching <br/>\nconsole players. Action is faster. Rewards are more immediate, in the <br/>\nconsole world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe addition of online technology to consoles will cause an evolution <br/>\nin console games, and over time educate console gamers to a more <br/>\ntolerant attitued toward EQ like games. They will learn the value of <br/>\nplaying cooperatively and attaining in-game goals. But that will take <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately the two worlds will become more integrated, but the time <br/>\nframe is an unknown. What ideas will investors back? How will this <br/>\naffect the products we can buy, and at what cost?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, flexibility will be the key to finding the optimal gaming <br/>\nexperience. The pc and the console, and whatever new is to come, are <br/>\nbut the tools for gaming. I see the potential for games to become <br/>\ndeeper, more involving, and very fulfilling, if we are willing to <br/>\ngrow with the industry.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
