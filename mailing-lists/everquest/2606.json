I obviously enjoy<br/>\nplaying. :-) I&#39;m not sure exactly what kind of advice you&#39;re asking for<br/>\nhere. Anything specific you need to know about?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. I am not a very good EQ<br/>\nplayer. I would consider myself ultra competent in group battles, but in<br/>\nother aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I have never gotten a<br/>\ncharacter past level 40. My first character was an Erudite Enchanter by the<br/>\nname of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to level 40 after two years or<br/>\nso. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which was my friends character but I<br/>\nown it. I just started playing again after giving up on the game and playing<br/>\nDAOC. Eventually I gave up all MMORPGS deciding they were a waste of time.<br/>\nAbout a week ago, I decided to give EQ another chance and have decided that<br/>\nit has improved a great deal. I am now playing a Human Ranger who is level<br/>\n30. I really like the character. His buffs and damage spells are great. I<br/>\nguess I could use some help on how to be a good EQ player. I have been<br/>\nplaying for about two years and I feel like I know absolutely nothing about<br/>\nthe game. I have never belonged to a good guild or anything. I play on the<br/>\nXegony server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
