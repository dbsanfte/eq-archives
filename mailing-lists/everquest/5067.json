However, since we got the new computer, I have been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thinking of someday making the trip.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Trouble is, I don&#39;t know how to get there. Granted, I haven&#39;t yet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried, but when I look on some of the EQ sites I visit, I don&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any way to get there. Is there a boat? From where? Is it even worth<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going there?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t even gone to Jagged Pines since we got a machine that makes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the zone playable. In fact, I need to visit lots of places. I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only limited experience on Luclin due to the lag.
