I am a<br/>\n&gt; lvl 20 (almost 21) Mage and am in need of cash. (Those spells are<br/>\n&gt; real expensive!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone knows where to get good loot please let me know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!!<br/>\n&gt; Faroina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nWell, if they aren&#39;t camped there are the aquagoblin camps in butcherblock<br/>\nmountains. They drop a few items that sell for a few plat each. If you hunt<br/>\nrats in freeport they drop plague rat tails that sell for just over 1 plat.<br/>\nYou can also take up a tradeskill like brewery and make money selling heady<br/>\nkiolas (trivial at 46). You can probably solo the bandits in highpass (right<br/>\nnear highkeep). They drop bronze weapons and gems that sell for a few plat.<br/>\nI think Netherbian Lair is also good for loot but I&#39;m not sure on the levels<br/>\nthere.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
