Both were taken to court, \nneither were ever proven.&nbsp; Basically because the children who committed \nsuicide were known to have f*cked up family lives and mental problems to begin \nwith.&nbsp; The music was no more to blame than the musicians.&nbsp; The parents \nwere just looking for a scapegoat.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Now as I see it, Sony does put a label on the game \nsaying that it does contain graphically violent content and some mature \nsituations.&nbsp; Sony cannot be held liable for anything that happens.&nbsp; \nI&#39;ve just recently noticed they also started labelling it that it may cause \nepileptic seizures.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Now I have been playing Everquest for over a \nyear.&nbsp; And consequently enough, it&#39;s helped me more than hindered me.&nbsp; \nI started playing at a down point in my life when I didn&#39;t have a social life, \nwhen I never left my apartment, and I really had nothing to do except sit and \nwatch TV all day.&nbsp; I craved social interaction, and for a guy that lived \nway out in the boonies with no transportation, Everquest was a god-send.&nbsp; \nthe people at work turned me on to it strictly for those reasons.&nbsp; It \nbecame my social life when I needed one.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Now things are different.&nbsp; I get out more, I \nhave a social life, and I&#39;ve turned a few other people on to the game.&nbsp; I \ndon&#39;t play nearly as much as I used to, but I still enjoy the game for its \ninteraction - it&#39;s still &quot;new&quot; to me.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">So if anyone commits suicide, it has nothing to do \nwith the game, it&#39;s cause they already had some mental problems and inside \nturmoil that they were harboring even before EverQuest came along.&nbsp; That&#39;s \nwhat I believe.&nbsp; And again, I think it&#39;s just the parents looking for a \nscapegoat.&nbsp; My parents know I play EverQuest.&nbsp; Albeit, they think I \nplay it too much, but because I am the one paying for it, they don&#39;t try to stop \nme. </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">and that&#39;s that.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"vash_love_and_peace@...\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vash_love_and_peace@...\">Vash The Stampede</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Friday, October 25, 2002 3:56 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Re: The News</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>BAH! tell your parents to shut up, 48 hours just played on \n  the bad <br>news about the game, if that were true then they would also play \n  on <br>Ultima Online and Ashron&#39;s call 1 and 2 and also Dark Age of Camelot. \n  <br>They just played on that story because more people that I know play \n  <br>Everquest than any other online game, people who have quit EQ has <br>come \n  back because it is by far that I heard of the superior of the <br>breed of \n  online games. BAH!!! Listen to the REAL news like CNN and <br>stuff, don&#39;t \n  listen to 48 hours or talk shows, they only want <br>ratings, tell your \n  Parents that if they got a problem with EQ talk to <br>me I&#39;ll knock some \n  sense into them! I&#39;ve been playing for 2 years, my <br>cousin&#39;s been playing \n  since it game out along with his friends and <br>they&#39;re fine. yeah There are \n  obsessed people out there but that&#39;s for <br>all the games not just EQ. I mean \n  there are stalkers out there also. <br>jeezuz, and if they talk to me about \n  the game tell them to email me <br>or shut up about giveing you crap about EQ. \n  Same goes for anyone else <br>who has this problem, tell your parents to get \n  over it, if they KNOW <br>you and they should, then there is no problems \n  unless you&#39;ve done <br>that kind of stupid stuff before (suicide), I mean as \n  you all <br>probally heard about EQ that guy who commited suicide had a mentel \n  <br>condition, hopefully none of you have that problem, and if you do, \n  <br>just be safe ^_^. <br><br>--- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Thunder Cat&quot; \n  &lt;Thunder_Cat_4283@h...&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; Has anyone heard the news lately \n  about EverQuest?
