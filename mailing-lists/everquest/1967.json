The only problem you have is that your video card<br/>\n*MUST* be dx8 certified. Other than that even going as low as 128 megs will<br/>\nwork. There is not the slightest chance in hell you can install luclin on<br/>\nthat machine tho, cause it will die while trying to render the new graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you should really get more ram, it isnt that expensive. Ram and a nice<br/>\nvideo card and everything works a lot smoother. CPU power isnt that<br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\n512mb for $100 isnt steep. And your machine needs to be nicely configured.<br/>\nFor example if you run WinXP old world eq and me would be like 256 megs to<br/>\nrun ok but on 98 128 works ok and 160 is fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd dont be so negative, SoL is a whopping expansion worth the new specs.<br/>\nGraphics are cool (some char models are a bit weird) but mobs/surrondings<br/>\nare very nice. The mob features are a LOT improved adding more tactics to<br/>\nfights. <br/>\n<br/>\n/Alex<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: den 11 december 2001 10:02<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] I hate Shadows of Luclin and I don&#39;t even own<br/>\nit yet...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly don&#39;t know.<br/>\nI am hoping (as do some of the GMs) that they will make it so that<br/>\nnon-Luclin users can still play without having to upgrade.<br/>\nBut for the time being, if your computer does not meet the minimum system<br/>\nrequirements that Verant listed, it will probably not work-- even people<br/>\nwho&#39;s computers *do* meet the minimum requirements are having problems right<br/>\nnow.<br/>\nWe&#39;ll just have to wait and see.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; SU<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have ben reading this site as recent a few posts.
