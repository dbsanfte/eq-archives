The<br/>\nfirst merchant next to the bank sells them. He sells both kinds, stackable<br/>\nand non-stackable coffins. I just had to buy a couple yesterday :-( Some<br/>\nguild members do not listen about pushing mobs through the wall, I was<br/>\ntanking a flurry drake in NToV and it got pushed through the wall and it<br/>\nsummon myself and 2 others. Since I was bound in bazaar and the corpse&#39;s<br/>\nwere now almost to the Plane of Mischief zone, they had to be summoned. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, has anyone else been to the PoM zone before? Some card drops are<br/>\ndropped at a ridiculous rate. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tcarmacculloch [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crhydderch@...\">crhydderch@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tTuesday, June 18, 2002 6:34 PM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\t[EverQuest] Re: getting started<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have to Agree with Erik here.  Each class hass a role to play in <br/>\n\tany grouping.  Especially when it comes epic Raids.  As one of the <br/>\n\tpremier Sk&#39;s in my guild on Saryn,  I&#39;m needed  in regards to <br/>\n\ttanking, Fearing on occassion and if we need to go to aplace with <br/>\n\talot of undead like the Epic raid to The Hole this past weekend IVU <br/>\n\twas needed to get to where 2 of the Epic mobs spawned so we didnt <br/>\n\thave a bunch of casualties. alos using hat Evocation skill is a <br/>\n\tdefinate plus when using the Ward Undead line of spells.  Also to a <br/>\n\tminor degree so far  with FD we can stay at the pull spot and be the<br/>\n<br/>\n\tspy network to give out the all clear if everyone in the group is <br/>\n\tdead  so the Clerics if they have not zoned or logged can come in<br/>\nand <br/>\n\trezz folks<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMonks are great for pulling when it comes to breaking agro&#39;s.  Using<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFD  9 times out of 10 they can sucessfully  break the agro train so <br/>\n\tthe rest of us can go after one particular mob. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tClerics obviously are a plus when it comes to heals and rezzes if <br/>\n\tthings go completely awry<br/>\n<br/>\n\tRangers and Druids have that nice tracking ability to let folks know<br/>\n<br/>\n\tif the objective has spawned or not.  Not to mention the dot&#39;s, <br/>\n\tsnares and roots they have<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNecros  have this nice little spell called summoned corpse. if<br/>\nthings <br/>\n\tget hairy and peeps who were not able to get out in time need to get<br/>\n<br/>\n\ta rezz and their corpse happens to be deep into the zone with a <br/>\n\tgazillion mobs between the zoneline and their corpse (CT, ToFS, The <br/>\n\tHole, Befallen are prime examples) If the prson  manages to make it <br/>\n\tback tot he zone nekked then the necro can target the PC and summon <br/>\n\tthe corpse.  admittedly Sk have the lesser summon corpse spell but <br/>\n\tihave not used it yet and still can&#39;t find whre Ineed to get the <br/>\n\tcoffin Ineed for that spell seeing as Neriak still doenst have them <br/>\n\thehe I may ned to go into Paineel for it.  Plus necros can fear cast<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIVU and also have other nice damaging spells at teir disposal.  and <br/>\n\tDMF is to die for when you need to swim to someplace and you dont <br/>\n\thave  a good  underwater spell not to mentionletting you see invis <br/>\n\tand float at the same time<br/>\n<br/>\n\tShamans have a lot of nice spells to cast on peeps and some can be <br/>\n\tstacked with other peeps buffs.  not to mention they have some nice <br/>\n\tdot&#39;s  and back up roots  if the Druids are unable to root.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPallies make great tanks as well as back up healers and at higher <br/>\n\tlevels can do  limited rezes. buffs are of the lower end Cleric line<br/>\n<br/>\n\tbut if no cleric is around for heal&#39;s buffs and rezzes, are you<br/>\ngonna <br/>\n\tcomplain? I ain&#39;t cause a pally buff/heal could mean the difference <br/>\n\tbetween life and death.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tChanter&#39;s have ths nice mezz line of spells as well as charm.  Ever <br/>\n\tbeen to a raid or in group where you have a couple of mobs on your <br/>\n\trear end and you happen to see a mob fighitng another mob?  Thank <br/>\n\tthat Chanter for that.  And their  Clarity line of spells are a <br/>\n\tgodsend for  all of us mana users<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSpeaking of Meddings and such dont forgett eh bards with their mana <br/>\n\tsong that goes quite well in conjuntion with Clarity.  also their <br/>\n\tRegen song goes great in conjunction with  some of teh Regen spells <br/>\n\tsome peeps (shammy  comes to mind right off the bat) have<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThen you have the Rogues.  Not only do they tank well but they also <br/>\n\thave this nice  backstab ability that can do some serious damage to <br/>\n\tthe mob giving that nice death from behind effect<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMages and Wizards have some great nuke spells that come quite handy <br/>\n\twhen an especially difficult mob is encountered and the pally lay on<br/>\n<br/>\n\thands is used up the sk harm touch is used up and your healers are <br/>\n\toom <br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd last but not least oyu have the Warrior.  The premier Tank <br/>\n\tclass.  You need a tanks to help take down a mob call a warrior.<br/>\nnot <br/>\n\tonly do they hit hard but the can do some nice crits as well as kick<br/>\n<br/>\n\tharder than a mule and igf I remember correctly they can duel wield <br/>\n\tand double attack thus making them a force to be reckoned with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy apologies if I did not mention the Beastlord.  I have not come <br/>\n\tacross one yet at the time of this writing so i have very little <br/>\n\t(read as none =()information as to how they fit in the scheme of <br/>\n\tthings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAll of the above of course is based on my personal encounters with <br/>\n\teach of these classes.  Whether my encounter be in group or based on<br/>\n<br/>\n\tthe chars I have of a particular class.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tCynfyn MacCulloch 47 DESK<br/>\n\tHalyburton Bearhugger 22 BarbShm<br/>\n\tSaltaque 12HIEEnch<br/>\n\tQapmoc 11HalfElfRng<br/>\n\tOroblram 8HuWar<br/>\n\tDefender of the Faith<br/>\n\tSaryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> \t--- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;erik&quot; &lt;naslund@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n\t&gt; <br/>\n\t&gt; This is the kinda thing that gives people the wrong impression<br/>\nabout<br/>\n\t&gt; classes.  Shaman are extremely important to a raid, from slowing a<br/>\n<br/>\n\tmob to<br/>\n\t&gt; giving melee some excellent stat buffs.  High level Rangers put<br/>\nout <br/>\n\tobscene<br/>\n\t&gt; amounts of damage and are able to tank mobs that aggro on casters,<br/>\n<br/>\n\twhile<br/>\n\t&gt; being about to almost immedialely reduce aggro when needed.  Mages<br/>\n<br/>\n\tare<br/>\n\t&gt; excellent for mana regen (mod rods) and CotH.  Druids are<br/>\nexcellent<br/>\n\t&gt; secondary healers on raid, throwing in heals between CHs.  Monks <br/>\n\tand SK&#39;s<br/>\n\t&gt; are excellent indoor pullers (breaking Fear is terribly hard <br/>\n\twithout a Monk<br/>\n\t&gt; or SK to scout).<br/>\n\t&gt; <br/>\n\t&gt; There really isn&#39;t one single class that is not needed in a raid <br/>\n\tsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t------------------------ Yahoo!
