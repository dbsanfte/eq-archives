She was farming silks<br>with her lvl 17 and got mad bc a lvl 4 came \n  over and was trying to hunt mobs<br>in the same area (the newbie area). She \n  kept having a fit that he was going<br>after the mobs she wanted to kill. When \n  I tried to explain to her that<br>technically farming is against the rules and \n  the lvl 4 had every right to<br>hunt and wasn&#39;t doing anything wrong or even \n  rude, she just yelled at me.<br>Then later on she was camping a spot with her \n  lvl 10 where she was getting<br>xp and swirling shadows. A Baron came up and \n  started killing mobs all around<br>her. She told him that she was getting xp \n  from them and asked him to stop it<br>bc she&#39;d been there first. He told her \n  she could get xp elsewhere and that<br>he just wanted the swirling shadows. \n  but she was after those too. After the<br>tried to reason with him he got mad \n  and told her to go ahead and petition,<br>and then started intentionally ksing \n  every lesser shade she attacked. I<br>mentioned it to some of my guild \n  alliance and I think one of them said<br>something to him bc he went away. I \n  mean, the dude could&#39;ve gotten more<br>swirling shadows off of the shadows in \n  twilight sea but he had to be a dick<br>and KS a lvl 10. But I guess what goes \n  around comes around.<br>I had someone else ks me at the same camp before. He \n  said I was being a<br>bitch when I complained that he ksed 3 mobs that I had \n  snared and was in the<br>process of fighting.
