I was in<br/>\nOld Sebilis yesterday for about 6 hours. I went back through my log files<br/>\nand found some interesting facts. Now my group was all guild members and our<br/>\ncleric was doing the commie loot. We worked the bar room first and later<br/>\nmoved to the chef room. After 6 hours we had a lot of loot, Singing Steel<br/>\nboots, Arms. Rogue Helm, Seb. Scale Cape and neck piece and a few spells and<br/>\nsome other stuff I can&#39;t remember. When it was time for the group to log, we<br/>\nall rolled 100 - 1000, whoever had the highest got first pick till there was<br/>\nnothing left. But when I went through the files with a search of &quot; has loot<br/>\n&quot; I saw that our cleric has looted 17 fire opals, plus many other gems and<br/>\njewelry. I also have a level 52 Cleric. I know it is hard at the lower<br/>\nlevels, but if you wait it out, your day will come. I know our guild cleric<br/>\nand enchanter was using a lot of peridots in the 6 hours we were there, but<br/>\nI guarantee they still came out ahead by several 100 plat ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the cleric was dropping all the runes and words on the ground and my<br/>\nwarrior was picking them up and I sold all the stuff he trough on the ground<br/>\nand I think I made about 75 plat on those items alone. When you get up<br/>\nhigher in levels, you won&#39;t be worrying about plat, you&#39;ll start thinking<br/>\nabout items. My suggestion to you is, find a guild or a group of friends and<br/>\nonly group with them. If you always work in pick-up groups you are just<br/>\nasking for trouble. If you think it is bad about FFA plat, bronze armour and<br/>\nfine steal weapons, you wait till a good 1HS warrior only weapon drops and<br/>\nthe warrior says it is his to keep because it is warrior only. But this<br/>\nweapon is not an upgrade from his current weapon, but he stills says it is<br/>\nhis, but can sell for say 5k, you got trouble. Find some friends and stick<br/>\nwith them or find a guild to join. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen it happen too many times, people fighting about loot. Just<br/>\nremember it is a game.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tNygaardr, FC3 [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nygaardr@...\">nygaardr@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tThursday, May 03, 2001 3:01 AM<br/>\n\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\tSubject:\tRE: [EverQuest] About loot order<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTrust is the only way, after lvl 35 ( I think its 35) this gets<br/>\neasier no<br/>\n\tmore book to stare at.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMu<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent: Wednesday, May 02, 2001 3:33 PM<br/>\n\tTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject: Re: [EverQuest] About loot order<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHow do you know how much coin the other people loot though?
