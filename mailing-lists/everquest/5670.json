The last two kills I have \nto finish the quest are the dragon Faydedar and the Corrupted Seahorse.&nbsp; \nFaydedar will probably happen first since The Fabled Estrella seems to be \nroaming the area where the Corrupted Seahorse spawns.&nbsp; We tried that once \nalready and she conned red to a level 65 beastlord with me.&nbsp; She used him \nas a footrug hitting him at 1500 a whack.&nbsp; So either gonna have to wait \nuntil the Fableds are past history or else get up one serious uber guild raid to \ntake her down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to have the epic done before I hit 57 so I&#39;m \nworking on AA xp until then.&nbsp; I&#39;ve also been stock piling a lot of my upper \nlevel spells as I see them drop or for sale cheap in the bazaar.&nbsp;I dont \nhave them all yet but I got a few for each level up to 62 so it gives me \nsomethign to look forward to.&nbsp; Anyway.... it&#39;s getting ever closer then \nI&#39;ll be epic druid!&nbsp; hehehe :)</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Raido Covenfall</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">56 ELF DRU</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Cazic Thule server</font>&nbsp;</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
