They have patched it but it still breaks, though less<br/>\n&gt; often.  But it is fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nStill breaks?  Not that I&#39;ve seen on mine.  I can get any mob to take over<br/>\nthe zone anytime i want, just takes time to get them to attack.  There will<br/>\nbe times that the wrong mob attacks, you just have to kill the attacking<br/>\nforce and go back to hitting the named to get the right ones to attack.<br/>\nBtw, one secret would be just hit the grimlings if you want either bears or<br/>\nwolves.  Most everyone knows how to get the bears to take over, its just<br/>\nmost get lost trying to get the wolves to win.  The trick is once the bears<br/>\ntake over, just keep hitting the screechmaw at the chiefs hut and the wolves<br/>\nwill attack the north, then keep hitting him till the wolves attack the<br/>\nsouth..then you have wolf only zone.  One down side is the bears attacking<br/>\nthe wolves once they lose their home, has happened before.  Just have to try<br/>\nto make it close to the wolves cave and kill the 5 attacking bears...and<br/>\nmake sure you count.  Miss one and the bears will win if the wolves already<br/>\nhave the north cave.  As for the grimlings...you have to hit the wolves then<br/>\nthe bears in that order. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
