I <br/>\n&gt; am a graduate student at the Institute of Design at<br/>\n&gt; Illinois Institute of <br/>\n&gt; Technology in Chicago. For one of my classes,<br/>\n&gt; entitled Observing Users, we <br/>\n&gt; have to study a product and its users. Our group<br/>\n&gt; chose Everquest because we <br/>\n&gt; think that it is very interesting and complex. As a<br/>\n&gt; retired online gamer I know <br/>\n&gt; how much fun and involving the games can be. In<br/>\n&gt; fact, I am very tempted to <br/>\n&gt; jump into Everquest, but I am worried that I may<br/>\n&gt; lose concentration on my <br/>\n&gt; studies. If anyone is willing to devote a little of<br/>\n&gt; their time to helping us out we <br/>\n&gt; would really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are<br/>\n&gt; poor grad students and will <br/>\n&gt; not be able to compensate anyone who helps us out,<br/>\n&gt; but we will very very <br/>\n&gt; thankful.
