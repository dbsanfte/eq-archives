Having never played an online rpg before I have a few questions ?<br/>\n&gt; (Forgive my lack of knowledge and feel free to laugh at my questions)<br/>\n&gt; 1. Being used to playing solo games I could pretty much play at my<br/>\n&gt; own pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other online players but<br/>\n&gt; seeing as I am a casual gamer i only spend  10-15 hours a week gaming<br/>\n&gt; is this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play occurs with whoever<br/>\n&gt; is online at the time and am I not tied into a specific group/times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes you can play as much as you want..........you are noe tied down to<br/>\nspecific groups or times unless you want to be. But watch out it is know as<br/>\nevercrack for a reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join with?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes it is very easy to fine other peeps to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kharnak, etc) does it<br/>\n&gt; matter which one I start with or are the later addons geared for<br/>\n&gt; higher level characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMY recomendation is to get the trilogy it gives you the three old world game<br/>\nand expansions and also get the luclin expansion, it will save a lot of<br/>\nheadaces later on, all of the expansions are geared for all levels and style<br/>\nof play, just the new one coming out in october will be gared for the higher<br/>\nlvls.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the system requirements<br/>\n&gt; but what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866, 128sdram, 32mb ddr nvidia<br/>\n&gt; geforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or should I wait<br/>\n&gt; till I upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe speed and cpu are fine but I highly recomend upgrading the memory to 512<br/>\nmb or the highest you motherboard can hold, the graphics card and modem will<br/>\nwork till you upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any feedback<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
