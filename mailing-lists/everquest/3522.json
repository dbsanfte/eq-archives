Halfling or dwarf?&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; I think someone who has a lot of \ntime on their hands should do a scaled drawing of all the races, shortest to \ntallest just so you can get a size comparison.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">If you try to put them in terms of measured height, \nwhere would they &quot;stand&quot; so to speak?&nbsp; I figure dark elves are between 5&#39; \n-5&#39;2&quot;, wood elves are between 5&#39;4&quot; and 5&#39;6&quot; and half elves are about 5&#39;8&quot;, \nhumans 5&#39;10&quot;, Vah Shir about 6&#39;, barbarians about 6&#39;6&quot; - 6&#39;8&quot;, trolls about 7&#39;, \nand ogres standing the tallest at 8&#39; or 9&#39; tall.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that leaves \na few out because I&#39;m not sure where they fit in.&nbsp; How would you measure \nthem up?</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Also, on a different topic, I&#39;ve been thinking \nabout forming a guild lately, but I&#39;m not sure of the process how to go about \ndoing so.&nbsp; Since I already have characters in 3 different guilds, I&#39;m \nthinking it would have to be on a completely different server that I&#39;ve never \nplayed on.&nbsp; Any suggestions on which server I should pick?&nbsp;&nbsp; \n</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The guild would be called &lt;Epic Hunters&gt; and \nis pretty much as it sounds.&nbsp; A guild devoted to people who are trying to \nobtain their epic weapons/armor.&nbsp; This entails mostly high level characters \n- that means people that have been playing for awhile that know what they&#39;re \ndoing in a group.&nbsp; However, since many high level characters also have low \nlevel alts used for mules or slaves, the guild would still be open to all \nraces/classes/levels keepng in mind the main focus.&nbsp; The guild&#39;s not \ndevoted toward pure roleplay, but toward friends helping other friends out, \nsharing their information, skills, treasures.&nbsp; The main focus on the guild \nwould be the quests.&nbsp; It is encouraged to do as many quests as possible, \nand to work tradeskills as necessary to accomplish individual quests.&nbsp; I&#39;m \nsure the details would fill out in time, but would anyone have interest in such \na guild?</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">So these are some questions and thoughts.&nbsp; I&#39;d \nlike to hear others opinions/comments on this.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">aluve for now</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric Rennison</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">31 HEF ROG Cazic Thule \nserver</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
