A player may \nask a bard or necromancer to verify that indeed their corpse is invisible, (the \nbard or necromancer can see it, but the player cannot), as sometimes where a \nplayer &quot;thinks&quot; they died, is not where they actually are. This is especially \ncommon in larger zones like Greater Faydark. Once a player has verified their \ncorpse is indeed invisible to them, usually a quick log out and log in corrects \nthe problem, if it does not, give the Guides a /petition and they will come to \nassist.</font></span></div>\n<div>\n<p><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">How long will my corpse last?</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Level 1 - 5: 30 minutes real time. Corpses need to be \nretrieved immediately or they will decay.<br>Level 6+: 24 hours of online time, \nor 1 week of offline time, whichever comes first.</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Arial\"><font size=\"2\">*Note: Empty corpses that are level 30 or above \ncharacters will remain in game for 3 hours. It is best advised to get your \ncorpse right away. If that is not possible, remember that one-hour in game is \nthe same as seven hours out of game. Also, be advised that your corpse decay is \nstill advancing if you leave your computer at the character select screen or \nplay on another character on that same account<span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-1965044489286520415-07012002\">.</span></font></font></p>\n<p><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1965044489286520415-07012002\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">Source: \n<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/common_gameplay_questions.jsp\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/common_gameplay_questions.jsp</a></font></span></p></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
