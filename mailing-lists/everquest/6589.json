I see a few people peaking in now, so that&#39;s a good sign.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, myself, am a returning veteran player.  Back in the day I was on E&#39;Ci which is now merged with Tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was amazed at the changes that SOE worked into my beloved game.  I venture to say that all of them are positive.  In essence what they&#39;ve done is make the game easier.  You can still immerse yourself in quests out the wazoo if that&#39;s your style but good gear, and good xp are easier to come by these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe addition of hire-able NPCs (mercenaries/mercs) with the latest expansion (Seeds of Destruction)has made it possible for anyone, virtually, to solo if a group cannot be found.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo many of the newer zones are beautiful and the xp, IMHO, is hot in many of The Serpent Spines zones in addition to those zones flagged as Hot Zones (+ XP).  It&#39;s now possible to go from 1-20 in relatively little time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have met a great number of returning vets on TUNARE server, which I find encouraging.  Perhaps SOE will regain some it&#39;s player base lost to other games.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome back to those who are just now returning.  Tunare is a relatively well populated and player friendly server and I&#39;ve heard good things about Drinal, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to email me if you&#39;d like more info as I don&#39;t check in here as often as I should.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay you never fizzle,<br/>\nMaegyssa</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
