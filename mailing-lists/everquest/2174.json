Not only do you get XP for killing the<br/>\ndratted things, but you learn pulling, group work --<br/>\nif you happen to find a good group -- and you can get<br/>\nXP from the dwarves for turning in CB belts,<br/>\nshoulderpads and bracers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my new Vah Shir rogue, I&#39;m finding the best way<br/>\nto level quickly is to work on my throwing skill and<br/>\nbreak camps. The Loda Kai camp near the mountains is<br/>\nproving a great place to do both -- I throw, get a<br/>\ncouple skeletal brigands, kill them, heal for two<br/>\nminutes, and then repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was levelling my dwarf in about...maybe not an hour<br/>\nbut certainly two if I put my mind to it and I was<br/>\nlevelling my rogue in at least two. It&#39;s  bit harder<br/>\nnow because I&#39;m level 12 working on 13, so it simply<br/>\ntakes longer.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Hanna<br/>\n<br/>\n(Vah Shir Rogue Karrah on Sol Ro)<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Bury my lovely, bury the lies, bury me under a thousand goodbyes...&quot; - October Project<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
