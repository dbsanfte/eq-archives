I don&#39;t know for sure how useful it is at <br/>\nhigher levels, but I can say that clarity has thus far been a a major boon <br/>\nfrom level 20 to 32.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to finding groups at higher levels, if you&#39;re in the right places, <br/>\nfinding a group about your current level is easily done. In fact, I&#39;ve found <br/>\nthat it&#39;s easier getting a group by not being set /role or /anon unless you <br/>\nwish to either roleplay or be left alone. Hope you find this info useful. <br/>\nGood hunting!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Shane Bole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EverQuest] wake up!!<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 7 Jan 2000 12:31:18 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I agree that the list has died, but anyways I got a question for all you<br/>\n&gt;enchanters out there...<br/>\n&gt;I am halfway into 28, would have hit 29 but I am cautious and I like to <br/>\n&gt;play<br/>\n&gt;around (all guards except highpass hate my 24 illusions... hehe).... How<br/>\n&gt;often do people ask you for clarity? and how hard would it be to get a <br/>\n&gt;group<br/>\n&gt;after achieving 29? and last.... do you recommend going /anon or /role?<br/>\n&gt;Thanks in advance...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Fabno Licious, 28th Erudite Enchanter, EMarr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
