Both have cracked staves (he recently &quot;swapped&quot; his for one an<br/>\nOrc had just in case his was &quot;faulty&quot; - lol), same &quot;skin like wood&quot;<br/>\nbuff - in fact mine wears off and I often forget to put it back on.<br/>\n:o/   I gave him some of my armor, making his AC higher than mine, and<br/>\nthen he went and bought some more (I haven&#39;t heard the end of that<br/>\none, yet... :oP ) and *still* he&#39;s hitting for these puny amounts and<br/>\nmissing a lot (and therefore getting hit more often himself).  I told<br/>\nhim to make a new character and see if he advances better with that<br/>\none, but he doesn&#39;t *want* a new character ::whine whine::.  We&#39;re<br/>\nonly lvl 6, it&#39;s not like it would take forever to work his way back<br/>\nup to it.  Oh, well, he&#39;ll survive...or not.  :)  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nLliani<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 4 Nov 1999 05:31:12 +0100, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Avron Elselynn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avron@...\">avron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Are you also using the same equipment and weapons?
