It was like<br/>\nthey did it just to spite me bc they knew I wouldn&#39;t get the xp.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well, yes I admit it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am sarcastic.  My most recent outbreak was most likely caused by your<br/>\n&gt; short one word response with no other information added.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll try it tonight, maybe they changed the way it worked but I know it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>use<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to be the way I described it.  Doesnt anyone else remember running to the<br/>\n&gt; guards when they were lower lvl and almost killing a mob only to have<br/>\n&gt; another jump you.
