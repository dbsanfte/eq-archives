It is the biggest problem in raiding,<br/>\n&gt; by far.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree. Maybe some people don&#39;t want to listen but not all. Some people<br/>\ntry very hard but because of lag or too much spam miss things.<br/>\nI had problems on my first raid to Hate because I kept missing messages<br/>\nbecause I kept getting spammed with too many spell messages and at the time,<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know how to turn them off. I also lagged and did not receive messages<br/>\nin time to take action.<br/>\nMaybe people get distracted sometimes. But it is just a game. Real life can<br/>\ninterfere.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The best way to get attention and keep attention is to<br/>\n&gt; boot people from raids that don&#39;t listen.  Have a person<br/>\n&gt; wandering off after repeated tells to stay in camp, TL<br/>\n&gt; him/her out.  It&#39;s the easiest way to get their<br/>\n&gt; attention.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would only work if they accepted the TL.<br/>\nAnd I would never use that tactic with my own guildies. That&#39;s just rude.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a game. It should be fun. And yeah, getting wiped out from someone not<br/>\nlistening isn&#39;t very fun, but I think it&#39;s even less fun to be nasty to<br/>\npeople.<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
