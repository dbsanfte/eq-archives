I asked if there was anything I could do<br/>\nfor him, and he said &quot;No, just do the same for someone else when you are at<br/>\na higher level and wealthy enough to do so.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that Froondor is level 41 and has a bit o plat in the bank he can afford<br/>\nto help out new players some with plat and equipment; it&#39;s fun to &quot;pass on<br/>\nthe good deed,&quot; in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say, though, that he will not help out those people who go around<br/>\nbegging for armor, weapons, and money -- only random players who seem<br/>\ndeserving.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there was the guy I gave a Sarnak Emblazened Tabard, a Straw Spun<br/>\nBelt, and a few other items to because he seemed needy. I offered him a<br/>\nbarbed leather whip, and he said &quot;no thanks&quot; and showed me his Centi Short<br/>\nSword and SSoY.
