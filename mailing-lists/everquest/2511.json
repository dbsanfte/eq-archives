Kelethin itself is no problem, it s the morons you deal with near Orc Hill that make it difficult. ;) The best bet for anyone who s brand new to the game","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1041813349\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Be careful in Kelethin since it is a hard area to<br/>\n&gt; learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kelethin itself is no problem, it&#39;s the morons you<br/>\ndeal with near Orc Hill that make it difficult. ;) The<br/>\nbest bet for anyone who&#39;s brand new to the game is to<br/>\nlevel up to 4th or 5th level near newbie lift killing<br/>\nbats, decaying skeletons, orc pawns, etc. then just<br/>\ntotally skip Orc Hill and get a TP to West<br/>\nCommonlands. WC is a little high level for you by that<br/>\npoint, but EC is great, and although it&#39;s a LAST<br/>\nresort (and a rather embarassing one IMHO), there are<br/>\na lot of high levels around in EC and near the druid<br/>\ncircle in WC for a bailout if necessary. I always hate<br/>\nmentioning stuff like that cause people tend to take<br/>\nit too far and beg for buffs etc, but if it&#39;s an<br/>\noccasional thing, it&#39;s better than dying and most<br/>\npeople don&#39;t mind. Just don&#39;t do it repeatedly. (like<br/>\ntwice in the same night :P)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nFind, Connect, Date! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://personals.yahoo.ca\">http://personals.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
