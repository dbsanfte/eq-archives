I&#39;ve been there.&nbsp; I&#39;m still there with some \ncharacters.&nbsp; But if it weren&#39;t for my guild, people helping me out, or my \nestablished characters, I&#39;d probably still be poor and using leather \narmor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as what&#39;s good prices for things, it all comes \ndown to what you feel like is fair to pay.&nbsp; If you think you can afford it, \ngo ahead and buy it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can do an item search in the Bazaar and see \nwhat other vendors are selling it for.&nbsp; If they all have about the same \nprices, then go for what&#39;s available.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"dawn_marie@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn_marie@...\">Enie</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Tuesday, March 11, 2003 9:42 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Generous \n  People/Intelligence Boosters?</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>I had been playing EQ for about a week, and a Dark Elf lady \n  walked up <br>behind me, gave me some buffs, and gave me a Smoldering Brand. I \n  <br>asked what it was and she said &quot;You can use it, or sell it and get \n  <br>good money&quot;. I thanked the lady to death! Later when I went to the \n  <br>bank to put the brand in there, I also noticed that she had given me \n  <br>600PP! Another Dark Elf asked me if I&#39;d go into the Herb Jar in S. \n  <br>Qeynos and buy a spell for her. When I did, she gave me a Runed \n  <br>Circlet. A Warrior asked me to do the same thing, and he gave me <br>buffs \n  and 5PP. I have been pretty lucky in that aspect.<br><br>With the money, I \n  have been trying to buy items to boost my <br>intelligence, and I&#39;ve been \n  trying to buy things to help my sister, a <br>Level 10 Mage out too. Can \n  anyone give me suggestion on what to buy? <br>Last night I ran across a \n  Karana&#39;s Tear Earring for 91PP and a Polar <br>Bear Robe for 6GP for myself; \n  and a Magi&#39;??? Earring for 50PP for my <br>sister. Where these good prices for \n  these items? And what else do <br>y&#39;all suggest might help me gain \n  intelligence?<br><br>Thanks a bunch<br>Dawn (Enie)<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
