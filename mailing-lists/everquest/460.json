The reason I&#39;m asking, is that I noticed that fish <br/>\n&gt;(which can be gotten by fishing, which costs practically nothing - just the <br/>\n&gt;cost of a fishing rod and bait) seem to last longer than loaves of bread <br/>\n&gt;(cost around 2 SP each). I was wondering if this were true, or just my <br/>\n&gt;perception of it. If this is true however, I wonder if the same were true <br/>\n&gt;for drink (IE - mead or ale would last longer than water)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
