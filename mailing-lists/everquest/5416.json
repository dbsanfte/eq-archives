Yes<br/>\n&gt; its true that other classes can pull too.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>\n&gt; many a would be puller mess it up though... that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; just a matter of practice since I&#39;ve been doing it for<br/>\n&gt; over 4 years now.  I never get my groups killed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I do wish there were a role for monks like there<br/>\n&gt; used to be... damn nerf.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Quwi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Lorie C &lt;mlchiello@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In PoP a bard is the puller of choice. Who cares if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lull fails, if we can fade. Faster then trying to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; split the pull. If you are pulling aggro off of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tank, well, you are doing it wrong. It is not thier<br/>\n&gt; &gt; job to keep aggro off you, but your job to not pull<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it off the tank. Try FD every 30 seconds. Then you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can do max damage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Awulfie A&#39;Mused<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Kent King<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Sunday, December 21, 2003 11:48 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: RE: [EverQuest] Hangouts for teens<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   LOL, so so true!  As a monk (my main) my trouble<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   now is that mamby pamby tanks can&#39;t hold aggros<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I&#39;m hitting the mobs.  The art of monkish melee is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   to do maximal damage, but to do just a little less<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   damage than the tank I&#39;m paired with.  If I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; paired<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   with a bard or a pally then forget it.  I might as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   well hold a fishing pole in my primary hand.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   You don&#39;t know how many times the tank I&#39;m working<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   with has over-aggroed and gotten the group killed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   You also don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve seen bards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   having to kite their adds and pull in even more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   because harmony fails :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Let a monk pull onsies... lots safer for the group<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   that way.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Quwi Changkane Fenin Ro Grandmaster<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   --- &quot;Steven R.
