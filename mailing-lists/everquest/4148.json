However, when I tried<br/>\n&gt; to turn in the items for <br/>\n&gt; my Broom of Trillion, Vira told me that Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; did not accept half <br/>\n&gt; measures, kept my items, and did not give me the<br/>\n&gt; focus item.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She evidently felt that I had somehow failed to<br/>\n&gt; properly fulfill the quest, <br/>\n&gt; yet I am certain I gave her all the correct items.<br/>\n&gt; When offering her an item, <br/>\n&gt; the 4-slot trade-box opens with that item in the<br/>\n&gt; first slot.
