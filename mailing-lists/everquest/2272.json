It really cuts down on the spam.<br/>\nI play with 2 computers and I always have these turned off on one of my<br/>\ncomputers. My advice is you better get use to it. The higher level you get,<br/>\nthe more raids you are going to run into. Until Verant gives us the raid<br/>\nchat channel they have promised us, this will always be there. <br/>\n<br/>\nSistily<br/>\n60 Gnome Warlord<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tjerlaynemoon_2000 [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ami_Chan_Mizuno@...\">Ami_Chan_Mizuno@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tMonday, January 28, 2002 5:18 AM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\t[EverQuest] Re: the gift of sow<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI was checking the list and thought i&#39;d add my two cents to this <br/>\n\tsubject line :)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI play a shaman, i just hit level 18 two nights ago (^_^). Ive paid <br/>\n\tfor a tp myself, sometimes more than usual to get out of a place i <br/>\n\tjust cant stand (like yesterday.. i was hunting in Lake of Ill Omen <br/>\n\tand someone was doing a raid for their monk epic, and everyone was <br/>\n\tshouting and /oocing and even /auctioning and when i asked them to <br/>\n\ttone it down to one channel because not everyone in the zone was on <br/>\n\tthe raid, i was rudely told to shut up and the less i whined the <br/>\n\tfaster they would be done) or if im despreate and someone&#39;s switched<br/>\n<br/>\n\tcharacters just to port me somewhere.  On the SoW part of the idea,<br/>\ni <br/>\n\tthink that taking a donation for a sow is all right, like when<br/>\nyou&#39;re <br/>\n\tin the middle of a fight and someone comes up asking for one,  or if<br/>\n<br/>\n\tyour in a group and really low on mana and someone comes up and<br/>\nwants <br/>\n\tone, or when all you hear is &quot;can i have sow?&quot; &lt;cast spell&gt; &quot;ooh! <br/>\n\tshes casting sow!!&quot; &lt;the whole durn zone comes running over&gt; &quot;can i <br/>\n\thave sow?&quot;  I finally put my character on Roleplay mode (full anon<br/>\nis <br/>\n\tnot allowed by my guild) so people wouldnt ask me as often.  <br/>\n\tOccasionally i have the random &quot;you are being inspected&quot; and then i <br/>\n\tget asked for it (my weapon is shm only so its kind of a giveaway if<br/>\n<br/>\n\tyou know my wep), and ill always cast it for corpse runs for people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA slightly different subject now... Can anyone suggest a good<br/>\nsurname <br/>\n\tfor my shammie?  Her name&#39;s Lorecie, at the rate im going i&#39;ll be 20<br/>\n<br/>\n\tby the end of the month and i want a surname hehehe.  Also am<br/>\nlooking <br/>\n\tfor suggestions for my fiancee (both in game and real life) for his <br/>\n\tcharacer... so i&#39;ll be taking his surname on soon.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks for any suggestions and my random ranting about the jerks in <br/>\n\tLoIO.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLorecie &lt;Vivix Protectorate&gt;<br/>\n\t18th shaman<br/>\n\tErolissi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> \t--- In EverQuest@y..., Jeff Gaudry &lt;bgrifter@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n\t&gt; &gt;to me.
