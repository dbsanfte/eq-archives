You can buy<br/>\n&gt; as many satchels as you like, but remember that folks can only see the<br/>\n&gt; first 30 items you have for sale.  I&#39;ve got a bunch of satchels in the<br/>\n&gt; bank for storage space.  You have to activate every item you want to<br/>\n&gt; sell specifically, so you an use the satchels for anything.  They do<br/>\n&gt; weigh a tonne (practically) so the bank is the only useful use for them<br/>\n&gt; outside of the bazaar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh a side note .. there is no weight penalty to movement rate in the<br/>\n&gt; bazaar.  So you can safely haul around 3 (or more) of those 25 WT<br/>\n&gt; satchels!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You get the satchels from the first merchant on the right in the big<br/>\n&gt; building between the 2 banks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope that helps!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh .. and takeout is a wonderful thing :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -- Ariaya (who generally on cooks in game)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
