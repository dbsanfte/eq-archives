I recieved numerous suggestions, and more support than I ever <br/>\n&gt; expected to get about the matter. But after all I have tried to accomplish, <br/>\n&gt; it has amounted to nothing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night, I once again was in a heated debate with Tinysa (even though I <br/>\n&gt; had been informed by a guide that she wouldn&#39;t be on until Thursday night).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After lengthy discussion, I was informed that neither my money nor the Thick <br/>\n&gt; Banded Belt would be returned to me, as there was no record on the backup <br/>\n&gt; tapes of the transaction having ever occured. I was informed after much <br/>\n&gt; questioning, that ALL COMPLETED trades conducted by players was logged.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Grudgingly, I got Tinysa to admit that it seemed a bit odd that 7500pp would <br/>\n&gt; simply vanish off a character into thin air. However, I was informed that it <br/>\n&gt; did not warrant further investigation because I could have just left the <br/>\n&gt; cash on the ground for someone else to pick up which also would not have <br/>\n&gt; been logged (yeah - as if I&#39;m going to leave 48+ days of savings around for <br/>\n&gt; someone to pick up).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Based upon the information I recieved last night, and from the numerous <br/>\n&gt; emails I have recieved from other players about the matter, I have come to <br/>\n&gt; the following conclusion - I believe that the Thick Banded Belt that I <br/>\n&gt; bought had indeed been exchanged. However it is my belief that for whatever <br/>\n&gt; reason, the server detected it as a duplicate, and destroyed it. As such, it <br/>\n&gt; would not have registered as a completed trade, and there for would not have <br/>\n&gt; been logged.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To the best of my knowledge, the GM&#39;s did everything they possibly could to <br/>\n&gt; verify this information short of restoring the offending character, and <br/>\n&gt; verifying that they did indeed have my 7500pp cash. In fact, they had me <br/>\n&gt; doubting that I had actually conducted the trade until I pulled up the <br/>\n&gt; screenshot of the trade that I had managed to take a snapshot of, and looked <br/>\n&gt; at it closely. Based on the screenshot which I myself had taken, I can <br/>\n&gt; clearly see the items in question in both trade windows so I know the trade <br/>\n&gt; had taken place. I also presented the time and date that it occured <br/>\n&gt; (Date/Time info off of the screenshot) to no avail. In the end, I lost my <br/>\n&gt; money. I&#39;ll never see it again...... Cheaters 99999..... Good guys <br/>\n&gt; 0............. I guess it doesn&#39;t pay to be honest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once again, I stress the fact that I merely present this information to all <br/>\n&gt; so that you may avoid having this happen to you. This in no way is a rant, <br/>\n&gt; flame, gripe, or an attempt to get a thread going about duping/cheating.<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unique Valentine gifts, available now at eGroups.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
