I&#39;d still say go with <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Planes of Power becasue that takes you to every <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; major city which is where you&#39;d go to buy your spells.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; The Luclin spires won&#39;t do that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Given your level, I would definitely go for Luclin over PoP or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>SoV.
