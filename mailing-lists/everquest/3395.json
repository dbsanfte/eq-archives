You can buy<br/>\nas many satchels as you like, but remember that folks can only see the<br/>\nfirst 30 items you have for sale.  I&#39;ve got a bunch of satchels in the<br/>\nbank for storage space.  You have to activate every item you want to<br/>\nsell specifically, so you an use the satchels for anything.  They do<br/>\nweigh a tonne (practically) so the bank is the only useful use for them<br/>\noutside of the bazaar.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh a side note .. there is no weight penalty to movement rate in the<br/>\nbazaar.  So you can safely haul around 3 (or more) of those 25 WT<br/>\nsatchels!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the satchels from the first merchant on the right in the big<br/>\nbuilding between the 2 banks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh .. and takeout is a wonderful thing :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Ariaya (who generally on cooks in game)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
