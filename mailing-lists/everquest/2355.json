Is this card new and did this start happening once<br/>\nhe card was installed?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Did you install the software from the CD that came<br/>\nwith it, or have you downloaded the LATEST driver for<br/>\nthe card?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Not so much a question but I searched my machine<br/>\nfor that file and it is in Windows&#92;System which means<br/>\nit is an Operating System file.<br/>\n<br/>\nSearch the web for this file and see what you get. I<br/>\nwill myself and get back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Justin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pavisoj@...\">pavisoj@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     Does anyone know how to fix the following<br/>\n&gt; problem?
