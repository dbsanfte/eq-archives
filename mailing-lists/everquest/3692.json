Level 34 puts me low on the<br/>\n&gt; food chain in EW. I have tried my standard hunting routine from the<br/>\n&gt; foot of the bridge, but have been beaten back to the zone repeatedly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This last time, I crossed the zone to get away from a mob, and was<br/>\n&gt; instantly killed by some kind of tracking wolf pack. They took me<br/>\n&gt; down twice more in the next fifteen minutes. Found someone else<br/>\n&gt; contending with them when I resurrected. He being a higher level<br/>\n&gt; offered to train them away, and did so. I got my corpse and got my<br/>\n&gt; stuff back, but am now a high 33 again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I may have to rethink my Velious career. Solo at 34 in EW seems a bit<br/>\n&gt; tough, even if I need the tufts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are the direwolf tufts only for hafling tailoring?<br/>\nI keep seeing them dropped on the ground near the bank. If they can be<br/>\nforaged I think you can forage them in GD and Thurgadin. GD seems to have<br/>\nless mobs. There are some spots that are safer to hunt. There&#39;s a spot where<br/>\nyou can just get the wolves and if you get into trouble you can run to the<br/>\ncoldain wolves and guards for help.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
