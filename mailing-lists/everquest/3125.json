I used to be subscribed to the Rialto but I can&#39;t <br/>\nkeep up with that and a.g.everquest too.  That come off the SCA-cooks <br/>\nlist?  that&#39;s an active mailing list, couldn&#39;t keep up with that one <br/>\neither before I even got EQ.  SCA is totally too time consuming for me <br/>\nright now.  Still got my garb and other stuff around the house but <br/>\nhaven&#39;t been to fighter practice or an event in over a year.  Hubby had <br/>\nhis name go through but I haven&#39;t done mine yet, his official name is <br/>\nWolfgang Schwarzvald, my SCA name is the same one I use in EQ--Bebinn <br/>\nMaolcataig, Bebinn is the name of Brian Boru&#39;s mother and the surname is <br/>\nMulcahy at around the same time period.  I don&#39;t anticipate any problems <br/>\nwith getting it to pass when I decide to rejoin the SCA.  BTW what <br/>\nkingdom are you in?  I&#39;m in Atlantia, Barony of Bright Hills, in <br/>\nprobably the only barony that has 2 Barons instead of a Baron and <br/>\nBaroness, I keep up on local Barony news, the elected Baron is a good <br/>\nfriend of mine and his consort is his husband.  I love them both and <br/>\nit&#39;s a very stressful job they have.  There was opposition to his <br/>\nconsort at first because he wasn&#39;t a woman, sheesh, you don&#39;t have to <br/>\nhave a male/female couple to run the barony.  Just have to have 2 people <br/>\nwho can keep the barony together up there in the fancy chairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee ya<br/>\nBebinn Maolcataig<br/>\n24 Woodelf Druid, Dignatio cum Demori<br/>\nBertoxx server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
