That thing that you have to click to accept is annoying, then all<br/>\nthose other screens. and now they&#39;ve added an aditional screen that flashes<br/>\n3dfx after you&#39;ve selected your server.

I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; even get past the login screen for 5 or 10 minutes.  Kept saying that it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t connect to login server.  Never had that happen unless it was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for a patch (which it wasn&#39;t).  Also noticed that the times when I<br/>\nchoose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my server, and going to the character screen, and the time from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; character screen to the game are much longer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m running a Celeron 533 w/ 185 MB ram, windows ME a cable modem, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about 2GB of drive space for windows to write to.
