Thanks to the<br/>\n&gt; others here I have been able to advance my Shaman into the high 20s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I now have a problem and again ask for some help...I am trying a Bar.<br/>\n&gt; Beastlord.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I now need to find a place to move on to and advance in levels, with<br/>\n&gt; my shaman I found I &quot;ran in to a wall&quot; at 15th level and it was like<br/>\n&gt; pulling teeth to make 16th , 17 and 18th levels. I want of avoid this<br/>\n&gt; with my BL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I have made it to 15th level (thanks to Mammoth calfs and wrath orc<br/>\n&gt; wristbands) I have all my spells for 15th level, most of my armor is<br/>\n&gt; magic or BL newbee Quest armor. I have the Newbee Claw,and a harpoon<br/>\n&gt; I could use a better hth weapon but by all acounts I am doing good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where does a 15th level Bar. Beastlord hunt to make levels in good<br/>\n&gt; time?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I thank you and will keep you all informed on how I do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wolff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nYou can try Paludal Caverns fighting recondite bandits and those phlarg<br/>\nfiends or whatever they&#39;re called that cast disease on you... Or even try<br/>\nkilling the mushrooms in PC. Or you can try killing gnolls and orcs in<br/>\nhighpass. Even bandits might give you xp at this point. The only problem is<br/>\nthat they changed the pathing for gnolls and orcs so instead of staying at<br/>\ntheir spawn point, they wander off to the guards and can sometimes attack<br/>\nyou when you are fighting the bandits. Bandits sometimes drop pearls which<br/>\nare good to keep for components for cleric and mage spells. If you ever need<br/>\nto be summoned by a mage, it takes a pearl. Pearls are also used by<br/>\nenchanters for making vials of viscous mana. Oh, and the weapons the bandits<br/>\ndrop are pretty good too. Dalishea is the highest level of the 3 bandits.<br/>\nThe dwarf is the next highest.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
