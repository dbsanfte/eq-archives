Unfortunately, there are always fizzles.  And mobs hitting the cleric, etc. etc.  I don&#39;t have as good of a solution to the jerks as was volunteered earlier(make a character on your server and yell at the jerks you have to deal with), but I do have one to show all in your group you are doing, or at least trying to do, your job as a healer.  The solution is set up and use macros.  At level 28, I have two main heal macros.  Each one states I am healing or greater healing the person I have targeted.  It also tells them to stay close as sometimes folks walk out of range of a heal.  This is my basic macro set up.  You have five lines to work with in a macro and my greater heal spell is in slot 1:<br/>\n<br/>\n/sit off<br/>\n/g Casting Greater Heal on %t.  Stay close friend.<br/>\n/cast 1<br/>\n<br/>\nI include /sit off so I can hit the macro whether I am medding or not.  The /g will groupsay whatever you want.  %t returns your target&#39;s name.  /Cast 1 casts the spell in your first spell slot.  You can do /cast 1 to /cast 8 for any of your slots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have macros to state a mob is &quot;On me, can&#39;t heal&quot; or &quot;I just cast Divine Aura, I can&#39;t heal - get this mob off me&quot; or &quot;Zone zone zone.  Your cleric is on his way to zone!&quot;  By the way, I don&#39;t always run for zone, but it sure gets their attention that we might have a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find if you tell folks what you are doing, they stop asking.  Also, any time I med, I call out that I am medding and how much mana I have.  My macro for that is:<br/>\n<br/>\n/book<br/>\n/g Medding.  My mana is at...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I tell them 50% or whatever it happens to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe some don&#39;t like the fact I say over and over again what I am doing, but I find most appreciate it.  I can&#39;t please everyone.  And when someone asks why you Greater Healed so and so 4 times in a row, I say I didn&#39;t, I had a bad fizzle streak.  They can see how quickly each of my healing messages came and realize themselves what happened - a good thing.  Enough.  Too much caffeine.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobiinton<br/>\nPiemur<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 12<br/>\n   Date: Sat, 5 May 2001 07:16:36 +1000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: About loot order<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, but I needed the xp and didn&#39;t want to leave Highpass. If I&#39;d pissed<br/>\nhim off he could&#39;ve easily disbanded me. I&#39;ve had people disband me from<br/>\ngroup bc they were pissed off that I couldn&#39;t heal them in time (like one<br/>\ntime in Crushbone when I kept getting hit by Legos-- the group leader didn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve me that I kept getting hit. She claimed that I wasn&#39;t even trying to<br/>\nheal her).<br/>\nAlthough onetime we had a group leader who was such a jerk that we all sent<br/>\ntells to each other and regrouped without him. We had to put him on ignore.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
