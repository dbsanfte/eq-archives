In fact that<br/>\nis in the game now.  With the SoL expansion you can set it on a low res<br/>\nversion of the entire game or high if you choose to ( that includes both<br/>\ngame world and player models ).  The whole problem here is when Microsoft<br/>\nmade a majority of video cards obsolete with the release of directx 8..<br/>\nPERIOD...  Everquest is over 3 years old now.  When it was first released<br/>\nDirectx was in release 6.  Since then with the introduction of Kunark and<br/>\nVelious, players were required to upgrade to release 7.  Directx 7 made<br/>\nminor improvements to 6, however, didn&#39;t require changes to the home users<br/>\nPC.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have Luclin you can immediately see the improvements in graphics.. It<br/>\nlooks absolutely great.  Problem is for a game that&#39;s been out so long they<br/>\nneed to keep up with the release schedule of Microsoft&#39;s DirectX.  With the<br/>\nintroduction of WindowsXP they ( they being Microsoft ) introduced a new<br/>\nrelease version 8.  Everquest is a game that has gone through 3 different<br/>\nversions of directx in order to keep up with the visual quality that ever<br/>\nother game out there has had the luxury of not having to contend with.  I<br/>\nguarantee that if any other game out there attempted to provide the<br/>\nenhancements and a quality product that incorporated the latest video<br/>\nstandards they would be experiencing the same problem.  Do you see any other<br/>\ncompany even attempting to release a updated DirectX 8 version?  Return to<br/>\nCastle Wolfenstein was released and is a DirectX 8 only product that<br/>\nincorporates the same technology improvements.  You will, however, never see<br/>\na DirectX 9 version... Nor will they be supporting the same program 3 years<br/>\nfrom now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe.. Computer technology changes every few months.. If your still using<br/>\nthe same computer you had 3 years ago, its probably time to upgrade.  Ah<br/>\nwell.. Its Christmas :)<br/>\n<br/>\nD</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
