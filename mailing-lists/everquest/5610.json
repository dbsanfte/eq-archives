Just got back in a couple days \n  ago. My<br>Halfling Druid lvl 42 returned to Rivervale, and I got this \n  whispered<br>message to meet a NPC. I had seen the message before, but since I \n  had<br>nothing else going on, I responded. As a result I went searching for \n  a<br>camp of adventurers. I talked to whom I had been directed to, and \n  was<br>encouraged to go on missions for them. However, I haven&#39;t found \n  anyone<br>in the camp in Butcherblock nor the camp in East Commonlands who \n  will<br>give me a mission. Anyone know about this Adventure business, or \n  some<br>place I can look?<br><br>Oh, it was sure interesting spending the \n  night in East Commonlands. It<br>used to be lowbee heaven, but I found myself \n  actually fighting for my<br>life and wondering if I might actually have to \n  run. It was rather fun.<br>A positive change.<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br>42nd \n  season Halfling Druid.<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
