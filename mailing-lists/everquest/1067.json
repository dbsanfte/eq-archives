Each level awards you<br/>\nwith 5 practice credits.  Those credits can be used<br/>\ntowards any available skill, to which you would like<br/>\nto increase.  After you have increased your skill in<br/>\none area ( either with practice points, or earning<br/>\nthem fighting in the field ) there will come a time<br/>\nwhen they will no longer train a skill for free. <br/>\nThink of the Practice Credits as a chance to add to<br/>\nyour skill, and eventually there comes a point when<br/>\nyou have to pay the trainer for their services.  The<br/>\npayment they would require, would therefore be noted<br/>\nnext to the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuHase 54 Pathfinder<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
