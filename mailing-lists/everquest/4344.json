The original Gold Box version <br/>\nof Everquest was said to have differences from the newer Everquest <br/>\nClassic. I think that the first version was said to have been <br/>\ndeveloped for use directly between two computers in a network or <br/>\nover a phone instead of through a paid game server.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have Everquest Trilogy installed plus the Shadows of Luclin <br/>\nexpansion pack. I just got into all of this last week. I bought the <br/>\nexpansion pack first because I liked the kitties. Then I bought the <br/>\nEverquest Trilogy so that I could use the expansion pack. G. I have <br/>\nno regrets. My only complaint is that I can&#39;t stop playing once I <br/>\nstart. I love this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdward</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
