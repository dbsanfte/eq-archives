However, male characters get listened to more often.<br/>\nIf a female character is giving instructions people tend to either ignore<br/>\nher or call her bitchy, but if a male character is giving instructions,<br/>\npeople are more likely to listen. Of course some people don&#39;t listen to<br/>\neither gender. Well, I&#39;ve noticed that they are more likely to listen to a<br/>\nfemale now than they were a few years ago. Guys get more buddy-buddy with a<br/>\nmale character. I like playing a male character bc I get treated like one of<br/>\nthe guys. People joke with me and don&#39;t feel uncomfortable about saying<br/>\nthings that they wouldn&#39;t say if they knew I was female. Also, females are<br/>\nmore likely to be flirted with and asked their bra size. So annoying.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n    Well this is an opinion mind you, I think most guys like to play females<br/>\nbecause of the way they look.  I have played females as well as males and I<br/>\nam a guy.  A friend of mine when he played only played female characters,<br/>\nwhen I asked him about it he said he liked the way they looked.  Well that&#39;s<br/>\nmy two coppers.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
