Remember, you \n  accepted the EverQuest Terms of Use, License and Non-Disclosure Agreement as a \n  condition for acceptance into the beta program, and everything included here \n  as well as what you see on the beta server, in beta-related communications and \n  beta forums and message boards are covered by that agreement. <br><br><br>HOW \n  DO I GET ON THE BETA SERVER?<br><br>In order to access the Depths of \n  Darkhollow beta server, you will need to download the Beta patcher. The FTP \n  site for downloading the patcher is listed below. There may be a lot of data \n  to download, so please be patient.&nbsp; You should run this patcher before \n  you log in, every time.&nbsp; Failing to do so may cause you to experience \n  crashes or gameplay issues that could be fixed just by \n  patching.</font><br></font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size=\"3\">You may \n  download the Depths of Darkhollow beta patcher at the following FTP \n  site</font></font></font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\"\n size=\"3\"></font></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\"\n size=\"3\"></font></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">FTP Site \n  omitted due to NDA.</font></font></div>\n  <div><br><br><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">To get to the ftp \n  site:<br><br>Enter the ftp address into your Internet Explorer web \n  browser.&nbsp; It will bring you to the ftp site.

You will see the Beta Server on the server \n  list, choose that server and log in.<br><br><br>HOW LONG IS BETA?<br><br>The \n  beta test is scheduled to begin on July 20th, 2005 and is scheduled to end on \n  September 13th, 2005, unless we decide to change these dates.<br><br><br>HOW \n  DO I GET TO THE DoD ZONES?<br><br>When you get onto the beta server, create \n  your character and head to the Plane of Knowledge. Find Old Man Thorren and he \n  can teleport you to Corathus Creep.<br><br><br>HOW DO I COPY MY CHARACTER ONTO \n  BETA?<br><br>For us to copy your favorite EverQuest character to the beta \n  server, please indicate which character you want us to copy by logging into \n  your play server as your favorite character. You indicate that you want us to \n  copy an individual character by typing the command /beta in your chat window. \n  Periodically we will run scripts that will copy characters to the beta server. \n  Keep in mind that we will be running the character copies on an as-needed \n  basis - not necessarily at regular intervals. It may take several days for us \n  to copy your character.<br><br><br>THE /betabuff COMMAND<br><br>The level \n  range needed to test all of the variations of dungeons for&nbsp; DoD is \n  huge.&nbsp; In order to give you that ability to test as much of the expansion \n  as possible, we have created a /betabuff command.&nbsp; Here&#39;s how you use \n  it.<br><br>1. Create a first level character on the beta server and log in \n  with that character (this command will only work on 1st level \n  characters).<br><br>2. Type /betabuff CLASS LEVEL - where CLASS is the class \n  of the character you would like to create, and LEVEL is the level that you \n  want that character to be.&nbsp; LEVEL can only be numbers divisible by 5, \n  starting at 20.&nbsp; So 20, 25, 30, etc.<br><br>That&#39;s it.&nbsp; The \n  character you created will be transformed into a character of the level and \n  class you have chosen.&nbsp; Your race and even gender may change as \n  well.<br><br><br>BETA FEEDBACK<br><br>There are two methods for passing \n  information to us about what you experience during the beta.<br><br>/bug \n  should be used to report bugs.&nbsp; Bugs are gameplay features that do not \n  work, spelling errors, and anything that just does not work as intended.&nbsp; \n  Please give us as much detail about the bug as you can think of when reporting \n  it.<br><br>/feedback should be used to send in comments about parts of the \n  expansion that work properly, but that you would like to see changed.&nbsp; If \n  you discover an item that you think should have less Wis and more Int, then \n  use /feedback.&nbsp; If you think a certain encounter is too easy or too hard, \n  use /feedback to report it.<br><br>It is important that you distinguish \n  between these two options, as one is read primarily by our testing team and \n  the other is read mostly by our game designers.&nbsp; Sending a bug through \n  /feedback can delay our ability to fix it, since we&#39;ll have to route that to \n  our testers for verification.<br><br>Please use this command to explore as \n  many of the adventures as you can and report your findings to us.<br><br>If \n  you find yourself in dire need of assistance, you can use /petition to contact \n  us for help.&nbsp; Please only petition if the situation is one that you can&#39;t \n  correct yourself.&nbsp; For example, if you used /betabuff to create a \n  character and you have lost the corpse, there is no need to /petition.&nbsp; \n  You can just log out, create a new character and use the /betabuff command \n  again.<br><br>Please remember that your participation in the beta program is \n  subject to the Terms of Use, License and Non-Disclosure Agreement \n  (&quot;Agreement&quot;) which you have already agreed to. Your access in and to the beta \n  program, including the patcher, is for your personal, non-commercial use only, \n  in accordance with the Agreement, and any feedback you provide is \n  confidential.<br><br>Thank you for your time and effort; we appreciate your \n  help testing this expansion.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br><br>The EverQuest Depths \n  of Darkhollow Development Team</font><br></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;</font></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
