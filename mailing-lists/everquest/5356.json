If I was in that zone, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to watch the wedding spam in /ooc, and I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to turn that channel off in case something<br/>\n&gt; pertaining to the game is being said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I attended a wedding at the top of the SS tower once.<br/>\n&gt; It was very nice, pretty area with all the dragons<br/>\n&gt; around, and we weren&#39;t bothering anyone. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.544 / Virus Database: 338 - Release Date: 11/25/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
