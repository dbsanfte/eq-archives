But i do","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1085847057\">Now i know some of you are thinking, didnt we talk about this!?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my two cents on the whole deal, and im by far the best<br/>\nsource for this info.  But i do know a few spots to make some <br/>\nmoney so ...<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, the only time you need to worry about cash is if:<br/>\n1) you REALLY need the eq someone is selling/need to buy from<br/>\nsomeone.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)you want to twink the hell outa your next character.<br/>\n<br/>\nNuff&#39; said there, mostly its going to be 1 until you hit the<br/>\nupper levels then its most 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you cant make money at low levels.  Well, thats cause you<br/>\nCANT!  deal with it.  No level 5 character can go make money<br/>\nlike a level 50 char can.  So start spending some time in <br/>\nyour favorite seat cause, your arse is gonna need to love it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -<br/>\nSo, i start this at about 10+.  This is based off my exsperience<br/>\nso, since i was a melee class, i dont really know how this will<br/>\neffect you.  And faction may just cause you to NOT be able to<br/>\ndo this also.<br/>\n<br/>\nErud&#39;s Crossing.<br/>\n  This has to be the best spot for wisp hunting.  The island<br/>\nspawns non aggressive bugs, wisps, and the occasional undead.<br/>\nFor those SK&#39;s and necros, thats a decent plus.  You NEED!<br/>\nand i cant stress the NEED enough a magical weapon.  I always<br/>\nmade sure my monk had magical gloves as soon as he could take<br/>\nthe frogloks in the sewers of Qeynos.  So, Head on over to<br/>\nQeynos, its the first stop on the way to Erudin.  They have<br/>\na vedor on the island.  <br/>\n  Pick up a spit, a fishing rod, and may some grubs for the trip<br/>\nthere.  Work that cooking skill up a bit before you leave.<br/>\nLook to get a bind at the docks in Qeynos, or if a caster bind<br/>\nat the docks on the Crossing.<br/>\n  Why a spit!?  Why the rod?<br/>\nYou want to minimize the costs while here and maximize the<br/>\nincome!  Fish while resting at the docks, use the spit to<br/>\nmake fish cakes, and eat that rather then buy over priced food.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow then - Simply put, hunt wisps night and day.<br/>\nI try to avoid groups like the plague except when i find some<br/>\none that complements me, a healer for melee and melee for<br/>\ncasters.  The wisps are good for atleast 4 levels of money.<br/>\nUp until 15, last i remember do they give you experience.<br/>\nIf they changed this, let me know cause i was thinking of<br/>\nstarting a new character.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thats basicly it from 10-15, ill work on a good spot for 15+<br/>\nfor the next post.  <br/>\n  Anyone car argue, but to prove me wrong is something else.<br/>\nSo if you dont think this is a good spot, start a character<br/>\nand TRY IT YOURSELF!  Dont complain to me ...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
