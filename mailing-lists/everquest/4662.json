Please!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fellow EverQuest&#39;ers. I am a communications student at the <br/>\n&gt; University of Washington in Seattle, WA. For a class I&#39;m taking,<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; have to write a paper about Everquest. It would REALLY help me <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our survey is located at: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sitedifference.com/edu/COM480\">http://www.sitedifference.com/edu/COM480</a> . <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you would like more info on the class I&#39;m taking, the course <br/>\n&gt; website is at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/redwood/com480/\">http://faculty.washington.edu/redwood/com480/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you very much. My grade depends on you. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I just can&#39;t believe a prof got away with being able to play EQ DURING a <br/>\nclass.  How much EQ do you guys actually get to experience?  I&#39;m curious <br/>\nnow.  Ya&#39;ll can&#39;t be getting the full immersive experience with a prof <br/>\ntagging along.  Own up, does he make ya&#39;ll raid something for phat lewt <br/>\nand keep the stuff for himself?  If he doesn&#39;t have an established <br/>\ncharacter that is profiting from this I&#39;ll eat my hat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas just reading the weblog entries at livejournal.  Someone was talking <br/>\nabout offering 5pp to someone for taking the survey.  One of the people <br/>\nwho they got to take the survey was a level 40.  Level 40 people KNOW <br/>\nthat you are a newbie if you think 5pp is alot of money.  Also, most <br/>\nlong time players don&#39;t trust people doing interviews.  We haven&#39;t <br/>\ngotten very good press, there has been various times when some players <br/>\nhave helped someone with similar interviews and then it&#39;s come back and <br/>\nbitten us in the behind.  Look up stories from when that poor <br/>\nunfortunate young man killed himself and his mom blamed it on EQ for <br/>\nsome examples, sorry I don&#39;t have any urls at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince it seems ya&#39;ll have a class of raw newbies, some EQ urls for ya: <br/>\n&lt;everquest.allakhazam.com&gt;  more quest information than you can ever process<br/>\n&lt;eq.crgaming.com&gt;  class-specific information for every class, spell <br/>\ninfo and what skills you should have for each level.<br/>\nya&#39;ll have eqatlas already on the links page.<br/>\n&lt;www.eqtraders.com&gt; trade-skills information,EQ isn&#39;t just about kill <br/>\nthe monster for experience, also look up the quests page on that site, <br/>\nthen look for your class and race, every newbie has a newbie armor quest <br/>\nto keep them busy.<br/>\nand for Tunare&#39;s sake, get thyselves away from Misty Thicket unless you <br/>\nreally really need the newbie armor quest materials.  See more of <br/>\nNorrath, you won&#39;t regret it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
