Well, I got a computer this way... (I know, I know...) Anyway, it arrived yesterday, but it will not turn on. It&#39;s like it&#39;s not getting power. When I hit the power switch, I can see the red light coming on for a sec, so SOME power is getting to it.... but it won&#39;t come on. The hubby and I have taken it apart and looked in it, but neither of us really knows enough about computers to tell what might be wrong. </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve emailed the ppl I got it from, but haven&#39;t heard back from them yet. (I&nbsp; just emailed them last night, so I&#39;ll give them til tomorrow to answer). </p>\n<p>I know I haven&#39;t supplied a lot of info, but I was just wondering if you guys could throw out some ideas of what could be causing this.</p>\n<p>Thanks. :)</p><br><br><font face=\"Verdana\" color=\"purple\" size=\"4\">The happiness you seek is right where you left it.<br></font><p><br><hr size=\"1\">Do you Yahoo!?<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webhosting.yahoo.com/ps/wh3/prod/\">Yahoo!
