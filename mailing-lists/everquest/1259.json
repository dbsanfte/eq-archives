But then when I run out of mana and I know my<br/>\npeope need help fast and that medding won&#39;t help fast enough I get up and<br/>\nstart beating the crap out of things. (I like to make my 1HB go up).<br/>\nSometimes if I&#39;m full mana, nobody is getting seriously hurt, and I know the<br/>\ntargets will resist my spells, I just get up and beat on them.<br/>\nI&#39;m lvl 25 and I still barely have 100pp to my name. Lvl 24 spells were<br/>\nabout 15pp each (from Rivervale-- and I&#39;m a High Elf). At 24 I think the<br/>\nonly essential spells to get are Greater Healing and Dismiss Undead. Symbol<br/>\nof Ryltan might help if you can afford the Bloodstones to keep using up.<br/>\nBravery seems to be outdone by some other shaman or other class spells but<br/>\nif you are the only buffer it&#39;s still useful.<br/>\nNot sure if Counteract Poison does anything better than Cure Poison...<br/>\nAs for the various incarnations of the Fear spells at lvl 24, I haven&#39;t<br/>\nbothered with them. I generally don&#39;t want to make things run away from me.<br/>\nAnd if they are high enough lvl for me to want them to run away then they<br/>\nwill probably resist the spell anyways.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I agree completely!<br/>\n&gt; I play a cleric and a shaman and nearly always get shafted when it comes<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; looting.

Not sure if I would have done :-)<br/>\n&gt; Not that I&#39;m loot greedy at all, but my characters aren&#39;t twinked and last<br/>\n&gt; time I bought my new spells I couldn&#39;t afford them all.  Am trying to<br/>\n&gt; survive with fairly crap armour and weapons.  I&#39;m lvl 23 and have about<br/>\n&gt; 100pp to my name, with more spells to buy next level.<br/>\n&gt; The best group I found was partnering a monk who didn&#39;t want any of the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>loot<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at all!<br/>\n&gt; Hugs<br/>\n&gt; Dalura (23rd Cleric, Lanys T&#39;Vyl)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 01, 2001 3:16 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] About loot order<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; loot order.
