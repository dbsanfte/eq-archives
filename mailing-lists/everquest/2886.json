But asking for items is frowned upon. Wait until you<br/>\nget some money from killing things and selling their loot and then offer to<br/>\nbuy things. And never be too aggressive about asking if someone will PL you.<br/>\nIt might make people want to avoid you. And don&#39;t be upset if people refuse.<br/>\nSometimes people just aren&#39;t in the mood to PL.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hey, well i guess i read more than i post, but i<br/>\n&gt; wanted to get this newbie some adivce:<br/>\n&gt; dont be afraid to ask for help.  when i first started,<br/>\n&gt; i was terrified to ask any one for buffs or extra<br/>\n&gt; items, but you should.  also, dont be afraid to ask<br/>\n&gt; anyone to pl you.<br/>\n&gt; Regards<br/>\n&gt; Charles Clavey<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Sandaris&quot;<br/>\n&gt; --- muaddib_1974 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:muaddib1974@...\">muaddib1974@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   How is everyone today?
