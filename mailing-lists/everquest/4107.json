YOU HAVE TO PlAY EQ<br/>\nonline.....The Cards you see being sold are<br/>\nPREPURCHASED game cards that you buy so you don&#39;t have<br/>\nto use a credit card and setup monthly billing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for your questions<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I have a Ranger and they are fun but it depends on<br/>\nthe flavor and role you enjoy playing. For instance,<br/>\nif later in the game you want to jump in the mix and<br/>\ngo pull that Dragon and go TOE to TOE, do not play a<br/>\nRanger.  Rangers are a Hybrid class, meaning caster<br/>\nand tank but not a true tank.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. You do get backstab and the Rogue is the class that<br/>\ncan dish out more damage than anyone else in the game.<br/>\nHowever, seeing as he /she has this ability, you can<br/>\ndraw the mobs on you very quickly.  Like a Ranger,<br/>\nyour  HP&#39;s are not as good as a warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  There are numerous classes in the game I would<br/>\nrecommend going to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com\">http://eq.castersrealm.com</a> to<br/>\nresearch what each class can do and their advantages<br/>\nor disadvantages.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. YES, YES, YES, YES , YES  (Need I say more)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n--- Louis-Gabriel Leal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nwojapan@...\">nwojapan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi there everyone. I posted this over on the forum<br/>\n&gt; at Sorcerors.Net <br/>\n&gt; originally and have decided to post this here<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there a way to play the game w/o going online?<br/>\n&gt; Probably not, I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; say. But I&#39;ve seen some gamecards being sold at EB<br/>\n&gt; etc which allows <br/>\n&gt; ppl to play w/o credit cards so I&#39;m tempted to<br/>\n&gt; install it. But some <br/>\n&gt; questions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1- What are the Rangers like?<br/>\n&gt; 2- Can thieves backstab? If so, do they fade out<br/>\n&gt; like in the <br/>\n&gt; Infinity Engine D&D games? would the enemy player<br/>\n&gt; (being attacked) <br/>\n&gt; be able to dodge?<br/>\n&gt; 3- What are some of other classes like?<br/>\n&gt; 4- Is it REALLY that addictive?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gabriel <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
