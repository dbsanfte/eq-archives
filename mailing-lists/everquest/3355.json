As a Halfling tailor, brute hides are a <br/>\nvaluable next step in tailoring. My son recalled finding brutes in <br/>\nthe tunnel to Dalnir, so I went there. Once I do an initial harmony <br/>\nto draw only one, I am able to root, dot, dot, root, nuke with <br/>\nsurprising ease. With a respawn of about 15 minutes I can keep <br/>\nfarming these for quite a while as I build my tailoring skills making <br/>\nHalfling Vale leather armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nExperience is not great, but since I will be working on trade skills <br/>\nas I farm, the time making lvl 34 will be well spent here.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I have gotten tired of farming here I will try Frontier <br/>\nMountains. <br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
