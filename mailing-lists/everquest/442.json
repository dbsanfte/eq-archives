Maybe you do have 22 years of<br/>\nexperience playing RPGss.. can you name any where you can give your<br/>\ncharacter&#39;s equipment, to another one of your characters? Or do you have to<br/>\nrestart with a new character - most only allow you to maintain one<br/>\ncharacter.  If anything you are flaming me.  I clearly stated that your<br/>\nrequest for info on the stein is no big deal.. infact I don&#39;t care if<br/>\nsomeone gives it to your or not.. and as far as you trying to bring shame to<br/>\nmy name KALE, if that is your real name, by posting my personal message to<br/>\nyou.  Whose the one who has a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW my other character is a Level 16 Dark Elf Necromancer.. where do you<br/>\nhave any room to telling me your problems. Stating my case:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  I didn&#39;t have a problem with you, if you would reread the message.  I<br/>\nsimply had posted a rant about Twinkies, maybe you took it personally don&#39;t<br/>\ncry over it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Can you legitably transfer one of your characters equipment to another,<br/>\nin any of those other games you mention.  Everquest blesses us with the<br/>\nablity to have more than one character, for flexibility not for<br/>\nexploitation.  If you choose not to be a legitimate player, forgive my<br/>\nattempt to maintain some integrity.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Obviously if you feel offended by anything contained in this or the<br/>\nother message, its perfectly clear to me and to others:  you feel that what<br/>\nyou are doing, if you are doing it, is wrong and you take the observation<br/>\npersonally as an attack.  I think someone might have a problem with their<br/>\nconscience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, and I hope its final...  its just a game, if you feel that you are<br/>\nhandicapped by playing the game as it was designed ( EQ designers have<br/>\nalways had concerns about players that maintain mule accounts, and look to<br/>\nways of hindering users from using them ) maybe you should submit an email<br/>\nto them, letting them know you want them to include an interface so you can<br/>\npass equipment between your characters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember Smile :)  I only state facts, I don&#39;t pour out my emotions to<br/>\nmake people feel sorry for me.  Please, please don&#39;t post messages here<br/>\nunless you originated the message, if it was meant for everyone I would have<br/>\nposted it so everyone can see.  But I do forgive you for your slander.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLance<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: kale usi [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 14, 1999 3:46 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Rudeness and info verification<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhitmore, Lance&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lwhitmore@...\">lwhitmore@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes I ponder this.  Why to people just give things away to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;people. Let them work for it, or at least pay for it.  Especially <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;when the person receiving it has no idea where it came from.  Its <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;funny and sad really, when your in the newbie yard and you see a <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;level 2 player chasing a snake around in full bronze armor.  The <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Crude Stein is no big deal, but if someone wants to give &gt;&gt;&gt;you <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;something that is significant don&#39;t accept it.  Add a little <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;character to your character, so to speak. Get down in the trenches <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with the rest of us, in the long run it will make you a better <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;player.  Some call it twinking, I call them Twinkies.. looks good <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;yet not much substance. :) hehe<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;          Anyways...   have fun... hehe          Duhase - Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this guy like rude or what? I just asked for verification of info, or a <br/>\npossible in game trade/sale which occurs on a regular basis. Does anyone <br/>\ngive merchants a hard time in the game? I think not. Nor do I think players <br/>\ngive other players a hard time when they come upon something they think is <br/>\nworth selling. He then labels those who do such things as &quot;twinks&quot;. I have <br/>\nover 22 years of roleplaying (MUD&#39;s, MUCK&#39;s, MUSH&#39;s, RPG&#39;s, CRPG&#39;s), you <br/>\nname it, I&#39;ve probably played it, and in my books, thems fighting words bub!<br/>\n<br/>\nHis response, to which I replied the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;For your information, I&#39;m a level 10 Dark Elf Shadow Knight and am <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;down in the trenches. An item like this doesn&#39;t just grow on trees, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and I know it. And another thing, just because I know where to find <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;an item, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll be able to walk in and just get it. It <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;has to be earned. Name one thing in EQ that doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;earned? SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.... before you go calling someone a <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;twink and make comments like that, I suggest you get all your facts <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;straight before you offend someone..... like you just did.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He then replies:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Like i really care if i hurt your feelings..  Big deal  i have 2 <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;characters that are lvl 16 and growing. Neither one is twinked.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe the game<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;is too hard for you, well some people can handle a little pressure <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;some cant. Big Deal.  Earn it.  Btw are you twinked..  Guess what <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;it still takes the same amount of time to get thru the levels.. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;just dont sweat it and keep playing.  If you read my email i stated <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that the Stein i hadno problem with..<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Seeya :)  and remember its only a game<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Lance<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you ask me, I&#39;m not the one with the problem here, and I can think of a <br/>\nbillion different ways to rationalize off what you call twinking LANCE. And <br/>\nif you&#39;re going to start flaming and calling someone something they consider<br/>\n<br/>\nrude and offensive LANCE, you better be ready to deal with the consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just for your info, my character is hardly twinked. Every little copper <br/>\nI have, I earned by starting a level one character with just the basic items<br/>\n<br/>\non his back that you start with. And if you think playing a Dark Elf Shadow <br/>\nKnight is so easy, I suggest you try doing so. Just about every NPC (except <br/>\nthose in Neriak) attack you on sight or won&#39;t sell equipment to you. As for <br/>\nhandling pressure LANCE, I have 6 years in the military. You don&#39;t get much <br/>\nmore pressure than that. So who needs to learn about pressure here? Not me. <br/>\nI&#39;d look closer to home. And while you&#39;re at it, next time I suggest using a<br/>\n<br/>\nthesarus and dictionary. Your spelling and grammar are terrible LANCE.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you out there who consider this spam, my apologies (but if the <br/>\nshoe fits, wear it). I just can&#39;t stand people who go off half cocked about <br/>\nsomething when they no as to what they&#39;re talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
