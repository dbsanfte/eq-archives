Just thinking <br/>\nof adding an item or two in the future. You are right, the money <br/>\nwon&#39;t be critical until I get closer to my next spell level. Just <br/>\nwondering if I could do both.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt present I spend part of my time in Velious, getting exp. The other <br/>\npart I spend in Misty Thicket, foraging Misty Acorns. I have found a <br/>\nminor money mine there. Running around looking for the ground drops <br/>\nof acorns is not too productive. Forage, though rare, is better. So, <br/>\nwhile I wait for forage to clear, I kill the conveniently grouped <br/>\ndiseased rats. The 1pp tails and a few stackable high-gold items make <br/>\nthe time at least somewhat productive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe present course, until it gets just too boring, is hunt kitties <br/>\nfor one bubble of exp, then off to Misty until I find an acorn. Then <br/>\nback to Velious for another round.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting to feel like a job. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Rob LeBeau &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; What do you need the cash really for? Meaning, if you<br/>\n&gt; made lots of cash then why not just find a place where<br/>\n&gt; the exp is Excellent.  My attitude is you can always<br/>\n&gt; make money in the higher levels.  Or take up a trade<br/>\n&gt; like pottery and get your skill up to make things that<br/>\n&gt; sell for good PP.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my 2 cents...... I have a 32 druid and currently<br/>\n&gt; hunt in the Overthere and I find the PP good as well<br/>\n&gt; as the exp.  But I am grouping since lots of baddies<br/>\n&gt; resist spells.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rob<br/>\n&gt; --- mlockridge01 &lt;MLockridge01@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have been hunting Snow Cougars in Iceclad for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level and a half. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The experience is good, and whether solo or duo the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time invested is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the same.
