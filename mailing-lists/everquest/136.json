There only two places orcs and gnolls spawn.  To get to free port you might try pulling the orcs to the guard wait for him to kill them or us him as your second tank.  Anyways heres a map of highpass... Parts are in japanese but you&#39;ll make it out..<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    -----Original Message----- <br/>\n    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a>] <br/>\n    Sent: Monday, April 26, 1999 1:01 PM <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n    Subject: [EverQuest] High Pass Hold <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Ok, I&#39;&#39;m a 9th Level Barbarian Warrior and last night I decided to make the <br/>\n    treacherous run from Queynos to Freeport.  I got as far as High Pass Hold <br/>\n    when I was waylaid and killed by a gnoll soothsayer.  I retrieved my corpse <br/>\n    and then spent an hour running around trying to find the way out of High Pass <br/>\n    Hold towards Freeport.  IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING!!!  It was also scary as hell <br/>\n    seeing how I was practically naked and the only player character in the <br/>\n    entire zone. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Could someone please give me some advice or direction in how to get the hell <br/>\n    out of High Pass Hold and through to Freeport? <br/>\n<br/>\n    McBanus of Halas <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n    New hobbies?
