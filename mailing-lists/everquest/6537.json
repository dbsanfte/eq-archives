I came really close to<br/>\nbuying a ps2 just so I could try it once *chuckle*  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell scott, its just like you would on the pc, i would assume. You<br/>\nmake you characters, and you build them just like you would on pc.<br/>\nLike for example, You have 8 toons a server u can make. I only play on<br/>\none, but i have all my spots taken up. Partly because i get bored<br/>\nplayin one toon and partly because I like to have a variety. My first,<br/>\nfav and my main would be my 60 dwarf burgular (Rogue). Then i also<br/>\nhave a 60 Erudite Pyromancer/Aeromancer (Mage), 60 Elf<br/>\nmetabolist(Alchemist), 60 Stack faithful (Cleric), 42 Elf Wizard, 33<br/>\nBarbarian Warrior, 32 Human monk, and last but not least 32 Dark Elf<br/>\nenchanter. I also have a sha on my boyfriends account. But as you see<br/>\nits quiet the same, We xp, we raid, we do pretty much the same thing.<br/>\nI would assume the jist is the same but computer might seem a lil more<br/>\ncomplicated. You really should buy the ps2 version and try it out.<br/>\nThis is my first game like this and i love it. I hope that answers<br/>\nyour question a lil bit....Talk to you laters</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
