Everytime I get to server select and try to get to character select.<br/>\nI don&#39;t have that problem with World of Warcraft but I think the login system is completely differen.

I even ran complete file check. I rebooted and closed all programs I didn&#39;t need... I used to be able to connect with my satellite but my connection and has gotten progressively worse. I don&#39;t know if it is Sony&#39;s servers or my ISP. Or both.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-08-06, 23:52:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You get this before or after you submit your user/pass??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I imagine you&#39;ve done a fair amount of torubleshooting to try and fix it.  what all have you tried?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wulfric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.10.1/64 - Release Date: 8/4/2005</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
