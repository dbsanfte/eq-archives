There are certain areas, and \nmobs you can camp at most levels, from about 6 on, that drops a bit better gear \nthan others.&nbsp; The only other way to gain much in the way of pp at the lower \nlevels is to drop every cp earned into a tradeskill such as smithing, or \ntailoring, to get it up to over 100, where you can sell stuff to other players, \nsuch as player made backpacks, and banded armor.&nbsp; All it takes to find the \nright mobs is experimentation, and research, eventually you will find what you \nare looking for.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Rich</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"ikestarwolf@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ikestarwolf@...\">Nuada \n  Armat&#39;gh</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Tuesday, June 18, 2002 11:14 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Hello and a \n  Money making question</div>\n  <div><br></div>\n  <div>\n  <div>\n  <p>I&nbsp;to thought that there were quick fix ways of getting money, but all \n  it comes down to is killing the right mobs, i.e farming giants etc, selling \n  your wares from tradeskills and farming items such as centi weapons etc. a lot \n  of ppl tend to use a high lvl char to fund thier twinks, which is most likely \n  the reason for the excessive amounts of money players buy/sell things for - \n  sometimes it feels like im trading in russian rouble&#39;s as in pp being near \n  worthless :(</p>\n  <p>i have seen some of these guides but havn&#39;t bought one yet so i have no \n  idea as to there real value or content.Most likely they are like other \n  official Game Guides for other games i.e a waste of time and money, anything \n  in the guides you can probably find out just by asking the right questions or \n  checking out sites such as alakazam and casters realm, i would ask around see \n  if anyone has bought one before paying for information.</p>\n  <p>Nuada - KIA</p>\n  <p>Druzil Ro<br></p></div>\n  <div></div>\n  <div></div>&gt;From: &quot;dnelle74&quot;

\n  <div></div>&gt;Does anyone know a good way to make money in Everquest. You \n  find \n  <div></div>&gt;these websites with these huge secrets to making plat. but who \n  <div></div>&gt;knows. I just started, and didn&#39;t know this game could be so \n  <div></div>&gt;addictive. I am a wood elf ranger. I boosted all my bonus \n  points \n  <div></div>&gt;to str at 90. So its not so bad. Im only level 3 though. \n  <div></div>&gt; \n  <div></div></div><br clear=\"all\">\n  <hr>\n  Join the worldÂ’s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://g.msn.com/1HM505301/46\">Click Here</a><br><br><tt>Visit the \n  EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
