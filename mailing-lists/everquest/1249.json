Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But \n  since I play the main<br>healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting \n  up to heal) I get<br>totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try \n  to establish alpha<br>loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the \n  casters. All they care<br>about is getting loot for themselves. These people \n  partake in<br>&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else \n  gets a<br>chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people \n  will<br>still loot out of turn.<br>And then we have times when people say we \n  roll for certain types of loot.<br>When I first joined a group, this one guy \n  told me it was ffa (and he was a<br>ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore \n  were rolled for. I saw that he<br>picked up an FS morning star and wanted to \n  roll for it (bc it&#39;s an expensive<br>item). He said no, it was only for \n  bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br>bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s \n  roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br>for bronze armor&quot;...<br>Has anyone \n  else had this problem?<br>What do you think is the best and fairest loot \n  order?<br>Just wondering.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br>ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per \n  turn (per person) works pretty well when<br>people \n  cooperate.<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
