And I have to say, this is the first place I have even<br/>\nheard people happy about it.... myself, I&#39;m glad I got to beta it, because I<br/>\nwould have sure been ticked off if I had paid all that money for it! And I<br/>\nwaited for that game for years. What a disappointment. When I went to get my<br/>\npre-order deposit back, the manager said that they had been giving a<br/>\nwhooooole lot of deposits back...<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I&#39;ll just wait for EQII.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kyndara Silverleaf~<br/>\nPathfinder of Karana,<br/>\nFiriona Vie<br/>\n&lt;Circle of Sisters&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
