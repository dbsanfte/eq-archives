Pretty good. Have to hunt with care, but so <br/>\nfar I am doing well. Good loot, much of which people will buy right <br/>\nthere. Also, I can sell my foraged food for a nice penny or two. I <br/>\nwill probably be here a while. <br/>\n<br/>\nI used sow, camo and levitate to get through Nektulos Forest. Kept to <br/>\nthe left, as advised on this list. Levitated over the river, since I <br/>\nam not a good swimmer. Never bothered to develop the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nA solo druid must be cautious in selecting targets. I found the <br/>\ndrakes and some little imp not too bad. Fire Elementals, Basilisks <br/>\nand the snake things can stun, making it hard to win against them. I <br/>\nam sticking close to the entrance, so if I am doing poorly I can <br/>\nretreat. I can either zone, or at least not have a long journey to <br/>\nget my corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bound myself just inside the entrance from the forest. Since I can <br/>\nforage well, I don&#39;t need to leave except to get rid of the weight of <br/>\nmoney and other loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really enjoying this zone. The recommendation was well made.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto of Rivervale.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., MLockridge01@c... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Lavastorm is good for teen solo?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll check it out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;ZeonChar&quot; &lt;ZeonChar@M...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Go to Lavastorm, great exo and loot all the way through the teens.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ~Daikun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shadow Knight and Guardian of Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karana Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;IT3 Adam J.
