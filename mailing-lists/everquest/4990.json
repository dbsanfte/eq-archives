I talked to Guide Llamar and he said that there is a general play<br/>\nnice rule that if someone is taking two camps they should share. That if<br/>\nsomeone else wants to hunt at one of those camps, for every mob the guy<br/>\npulls from your camp you get to pull one from their camp. But that can&#39;t<br/>\nreally be enforced. Camps are not actually upheld. By play nice rules it is<br/>\nconsidered rude to take more than one camp if there are not enough camps to<br/>\nshare with others. so it&#39;s ok to claim several camps if nobody else wants<br/>\nthem, but if other people want to move in, best thing you can do is pick one<br/>\nand stay there. If the person tries to pull mobs that you have already<br/>\nengaged then it is considered KSing on his part or attempted ksing.<br/>\nFurthermore there are rules against farming. The everquest official page<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t give details but I think if someone is hogging spawns by pulling<br/>\nmass amounts and not letting other people kill then it is considered<br/>\nfarming. I will have to ask a GM about the specifics.<br/>\nI suppose I should state my point, someone can&#39;t really claim more than one<br/>\ncamp if someone else wants the camp and can get the spawns before the<br/>\nmulti-camper does. It&#39;s generally polite to ask if you can move in on a<br/>\ncamp. If the person is rude about it just move in anyways.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Speaking of... what do you guys think of camping two camps at once?
