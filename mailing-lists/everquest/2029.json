Look at Sims. They make expansion packs but they<br/>\ndon&#39;t require you to change your system everytime a new expansion comes out.<br/>\nConsidering how addictive EQ is, even without the new graphics engines<br/>\npeople would still be playing. They could still add to the game by making<br/>\nnew zones and such without requiring a change in directx programs. They<br/>\ncould find other ways to make the game better without changing the system<br/>\nrequirements so drastically. What if they expanded the game one day and<br/>\nchanged the system requirements to the point that you could not afford to<br/>\nupgrade? What then? Would you be a happy camper?<br/>\nWhile verant may be getting a few more customers who can handle the higher<br/>\nend requirements, they are alienating older customers with lower end<br/>\nsystems. In the long run, that kind of attitude toward customers is bad for<br/>\nbusiness. If Verant doesn&#39;t give a fuck about their current customers then<br/>\nthey will start to lose business.<br/>\nIf I were the VP I would find some way so that there would be some servers<br/>\nset aside so that the lower end systems could still play on them-- which is<br/>\nwhat the GMs have been suggesting. And I certainly wouldn&#39;t release a game<br/>\nfull of bugs before it had been fully tested. I would also have research<br/>\ndone and surveys to find out just how many people would no longer be able to<br/>\nplay with their current systems and factor that into my decision on what<br/>\ntypes of changes could be made without alienating a large customer base.<br/>\nChange is important in some regard, but so is reliability and integrity. So<br/>\nfar, Verant seems to be lacking the latter two.<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a paying customer, I do not want EQ to just survive.

Change is good when it comes in the form of an<br/>\n&gt; upgrade :-) I think that for every person that quits EQ because of the new<br/>\n&gt; requirements, they keep 2 people playing for months longer by making the<br/>\n&gt; more enjoyable.
