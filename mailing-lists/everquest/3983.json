I started working on the Felwithe Defenders <br/>\n&gt; Falchion quest. <br/>\n&gt; I am 8th level and the quest is rated 10th to 15th<br/>\n&gt; level.I started <br/>\n&gt; the quest (talking to the Seria elf in the pally<br/>\n&gt; house) I killed the <br/>\n&gt; masked spy and the Gen. Orc (with the help of a<br/>\n&gt; Dwarf with a Big <br/>\n&gt; hammer.) (Note: the Spy and the Gen. Orc can be<br/>\n&gt; found talking <br/>\n&gt; together at -2096.28, 2326.77  in Greater<br/>\n&gt; Faydark)and they can be <br/>\n&gt; pulled with spells one at a time) I got their heads<br/>\n&gt; and turned them <br/>\n&gt; in to Seria and got the dull sword I&#39;m to sharpen<br/>\n&gt; the sword, and turn <br/>\n&gt; it in with  some arborean amber and a P.forest<br/>\n&gt; drakeling scale to get <br/>\n&gt; the first pally sword....well the dum sword will not<br/>\n&gt; sharpen, I use 1 <br/>\n&gt; and 2 sharping stones, the sword and put them in the<br/>\n&gt; forge in the <br/>\n&gt; armorer&#39;s shop and I&#39;m told &quot;these idems will not<br/>\n&gt; combine try another <br/>\n&gt; forge...WHAT other forge??
