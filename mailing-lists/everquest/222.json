Since they use a database form inwhich to store this temporary<br/>\ndata ( in a text form ) the transer time is very slight..  for the most part<br/>\ni would think that the time it takes you to enter a zone is based on this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. closing your connection with one server  ( there are a minimum of 10<br/>\nservers per World server<br/>\n2. connecting to a new zone server<br/>\n3. zone server transfers PC information and world conditions<br/>\n4. your system loads the graphic data that is stored locally<br/>\n5. tell the server your system is ready and your dropped into the zone..<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a logical guess.. via observation of the game and its proformance.<br/>\n<br/>\n:) Ves<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Brady Maxwell [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brady_maxwell@...\">brady_maxwell@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 06, 1999 2:32 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] What&#39;s missing in Everquest?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Brady Maxwell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brady_maxwell@...\">brady_maxwell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you sure about that? That doesnt seem to make<br/>\nsense. The only reason I can think of is that when you<br/>\nload a zone you need to recieve lots of packets<br/>\ncontaining info on the position and status of each NPC<br/>\nand PC in the zone. What items are for sale for how<br/>\nmuch and what kinda loot each mob has although that<br/>\ninfo could wait untill the kill. I also thought maybe<br/>\nthe Eq each PC was carrying would have to be<br/>\ntransfered as well. Or at least the texture map for<br/>\neach diferent item and which character might be<br/>\nassociated with which particular texture map. <br/>\nAfter the zone is loaded you only need to recieve<br/>\nupdates. Also obviuosly the graphics change but these<br/>\nare locally stored and load rather quickly. I think if<br/>\nthe Zone was on a different server it would load<br/>\nquicker. As each physical machine is supporting fewer<br/>\nplayers they can spend more time sending info and less<br/>\ntime crunching data. I agree about pipe and processor<br/>\nsize I have a cable modem and an AMD 333 and I zone in<br/>\nabout 8-10 seconds sometimes faster depending on the<br/>\nzone and I would guess how crowded it is. <br/>\n<br/>\n--- Shane Horne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dextrin@...\">dextrin@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Shane Horne&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dextrin@...\">dextrin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reason it takes so long to go from zone to zone<br/>\n&gt; is your going to another <br/>\n&gt; server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lilu<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
