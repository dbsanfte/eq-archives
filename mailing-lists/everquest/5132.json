candidate becuase everyone has their own story.&nbsp; Some are unique, \nsome are not.&nbsp; Me, for example, I&#39;ve been on EverQuest over 2 years and I \nalso have two accounts.&nbsp; The difference is that I started EverQuest BECAUSE \nof my job.&nbsp; Most of the people I worked with also played EverQuest and it&#39;s \nall they ever talked about.&nbsp; I began playing EQ at a time in my life when \nmy job was all I had.&nbsp; No social life, no nothing.&nbsp; Just Work and \nEQ.&nbsp; I slept very little and played up to 16 hours a day.&nbsp; Needless to \nsay, I becamse very burned out, and I quit my job.&nbsp; I moved and got a new \njob and put myself in a position where I had a nice balance between EQ, social \nlife, and work.&nbsp; I would have considered myself an addict.&nbsp; EQ was all \nI thought about.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t wait to get home from work so I could \nplay.&nbsp; But now, I&#39;ve been able to refocus my attention on other \nthings.&nbsp; Now I go to school full time, work part time, and play EQ when I \nhave no other social plans.&nbsp; Even though I still play, it&#39;s no longer the \nfirst thing I think of when I&#39;m bored and need something to do.&nbsp; I still \nlove the game and I have no intentions of quitting.&nbsp; Especially now that \nafter 2 years my main character is JUST NOW hitting level 50 and going to start \nworking on his epic and AA points.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">It&#39;s always interesting and entertaining for me to \nhear other people&#39;s stories.&nbsp; Although I wouldn&#39;t mind appearing on the \nVH-1 show, I wouldn&#39;t consider myself the &quot;ideal&quot; candidate since my addiction \ndays are over and I&#39;ve found a comfortable niche, but I think whoever does get \non the show is gonna have a great time.&nbsp; I know I did when I went to San \nFrancisco for the episode of Call For Help on Tech TV.&nbsp; Good luck to anyone \nwho&#39;s interested, and congrats to whomever they choose - even if it&#39;s me.&nbsp;

Hello \n  Everyone,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks for taking the time to read this post. \n  I&#39;m<br>&gt; working on a new <br>&gt; show for VH1 entitled &quot;My Obsession&quot; It \n  focuses on<br>&gt; pop-culture and <br>&gt; it&#39;s effects on society, people, \n  etc.&nbsp; We are<br>&gt; working on a segment <br>&gt; that highlights people \n  submerged in the world of<br>&gt; Everquest, and I&#39;m <br>&gt; looking for \n  possible candidates for the show.&nbsp; Our<br>&gt; ideal person would \n  <br>&gt; be someone who plays the game<br>&gt; continuously/excessively and \n  has <br>&gt; encountered problems be it family or friends due to<br>&gt; their \n  EQ habits.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Side note: This is not meant to be an \n  Everquest<br>&gt; &quot;bashing&quot;<br>&gt; story as so many from the past have \n  been.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt;
