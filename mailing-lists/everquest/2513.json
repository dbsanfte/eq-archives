Once you have that, you can always<br/>\n&gt; teleport back to where you&#39;re bound. (the spot where<br/>\n&gt; you go to when you die) If you&#39;re a Wood Elf, that<br/>\n&gt; will be near Newbie Lift in Kelethin, if you travel to<br/>\n&gt; Freeport try to get a bind near the Eastern Gate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One thing to watch for: Gate easts a LOT of mana at lower levels. It takes a<br/>\nwhole bubble from my level 14 druid.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; (pretty common request) Once you get your next round<br/>\n&gt; of spells (again memory is foggy but I believe level<br/>\n&gt; 9) you get a spell called Bind Affinity, which allows<br/>\n&gt; you to change your bind point to wherever you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; standing. It&#39;s your best friend to keep from getting<br/>\n&gt; lost, you can just wander at random and gate back to<br/>\n&gt; safety whenever you need. Plus Gate is your panic<br/>\n&gt; button, when you see MOBs you can&#39;t handle, you can<br/>\n&gt; always run away a bit and gate. (preferably with snare<br/>\n&gt; on them and SoW on you to buy a bit more time)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh. You are foggy. Bind affinity comes at level 14. As does sow.<br/>\nAnd it costs around 8pp.<br/>\nMy druid just dinged 14 and the spells were pretty expensive.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
