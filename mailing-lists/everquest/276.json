I went ahead<br/>\nand trained in several, and now I have 11 different languages, this includes<br/>\nCommon and Elf. Do you need to put more than one point in it to learn it<br/>\nfrom someone else? Or to teach it to someone else? I grouped with someone<br/>\nthat wanted to work on it, so we gave it a try. Made a key that said several<br/>\nlines to the group and spammed each other. I saw the blue message that your<br/>\nlanguage skills have improved several times but did not seem to see any<br/>\nchange in the language on the skill list. Also, when I right click to change<br/>\nwhat language that I am talking in and click the choice to scroll threw<br/>\nthem, Dark Elf shows up on the list of choices, but when I look at my skill<br/>\nlist it is not there. Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nChris aka Thunderheart lvl 16 Wood-Elf Druid Innoruuk server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
