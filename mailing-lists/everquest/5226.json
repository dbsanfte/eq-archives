I haven&#39;t played any int casters.  I tried<br/>\n&gt; a bard.  After all is said and done.  I went right<br/>\n&gt; back to the wis caster.  The druid.  I think people<br/>\n&gt; will choose a natural affinity for one type of<br/>\n&gt; character over another.  I guess it depends on<br/>\n&gt; personality sometimes, but I find the druid is the<br/>\n&gt; easiest for me to play.  I don&#39;t know why.  It just<br/>\n&gt; is.  I even played a rogue for nearly 40 levels<br/>\n&gt; before I realized I got more enjoyment playing the<br/>\n&gt; druid.  bards are probably one of the more difficult<br/>\n&gt; characters to play becuase of their song weaving<br/>\n&gt; abilities.  They have elements of both casters and<br/>\n&gt; non caster classes.  Because of this they are one of<br/>\n&gt; the most well rounded classes for all around<br/>\n&gt; purposes.  So if you think your personality is such<br/>\n&gt; that you can handle the difficulty of playing a<br/>\n&gt; bard, then I&#39;d say go for it.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Masteradept <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, October 15, 2003 7:54 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Re: hi I need help<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I would agree...playing a bard right off is not a<br/>\n&gt; good idea.  I <br/>\n&gt;   played a bard twice..and both chars have been<br/>\n&gt; deleted....start off <br/>\n&gt;   with a warrior or a cleric..work your way up to a<br/>\n&gt; bard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   SvC<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
