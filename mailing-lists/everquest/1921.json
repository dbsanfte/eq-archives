There&#39;s a high level cleric that comes thru on my server and buys<br/>\nthe small bricks for 5pp and the large for 10pp.<br/>\nI assume that the ore in Runnyeye is probably the same. What lvls is<br/>\nRunnyeye for?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I took the advice of others here and having finished my goals in EK I<br/>\n&gt; moved to SK. I have found the gnolls camped heavily, but while there<br/>\n&gt; have found Aviak Rooks wandering with sufficient frequency to be<br/>\n&gt; profitable. I solo them, getting about 1.5pp average in cash and<br/>\n&gt; loot. Not too bad, and I can pick off something else when they are<br/>\n&gt; too thin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone know if the hq ore dropped in Runnyeye is no drop? My druid<br/>\n&gt; does not do that well in dungeons, so hunting up the stuff myself is<br/>\n&gt; not a happy prospect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot, Halfling Druid<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
