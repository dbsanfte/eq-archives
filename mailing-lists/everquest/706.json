What ideas do you have? I&#39;m sure we would all<br/>\n&gt;like to listen to a few suggestions. You can&#39;t be a lone ranger and submit<br/>\n&gt;them yourself and expect changes to occur.. We all need to work together,<br/>\n&gt;unfortunately I here a lot of complaining yet no set forth solutions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hint us in on a few, we might just agree.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(and this is in no way a flame)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Didn&#39;t meant to imply that you were flaming, nor do I take your suggestion <br/>\nas such.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s just a few suggestions (of many) that have been made to Verant:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) To spur a &quot;player run&quot; economy, add in item durability on armor, weapons <br/>\nand such. The appropriate trade skill could repair the items durability - IE <br/>\nsmithing for armor and weapons, tailoring for clothing and tailor made <br/>\nitems, bowyer/fletching to fix bows etc etc. If the player made repairs in a <br/>\nshop with all the &quot;tools&quot; needed are assume to be handy, then there&#39;d be no <br/>\nreduction in the items durability. If it was done &quot;out in the field&quot;, IE not <br/>\nin a shop with the proper tools, then there&#39;d be a permanent reduction in <br/>\nthe max durability of the item. Also, have NPC&#39;s that you could go to who <br/>\ncould also make these repairs (of course the NPC would charge more). If the <br/>\nitems durability hits zero, then there&#39;d be a chance of it breaking every <br/>\ntime it was used. If the item breaks, it would be permanently and totally <br/>\nuseless.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) Have additional modes of transportation in the future add on - IE <br/>\nHorses, Flying Mounts etc. as an alternative to JBoots. The graphics are <br/>\nalready in the game for them both. It would take some minor adjustments to <br/>\nadd them in, and make them fully functional.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.) Have NPC&#39;s in key locations that you could pay to bind you to an area. <br/>\nWould have fixed the need to remove the Ring of the Dead (which should have <br/>\nworked before they put it on the live servers). Instead, they removed the <br/>\nring (another band aid patch).<br/>\n<br/>\n4.) Have rubi as a lore, no drop quest loot for a long, involved and hard <br/>\nquest. Would have fixed the need to remove it to decrease camping/farming of <br/>\nthe armor. Instead, they removed it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
