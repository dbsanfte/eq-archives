It would make<br/>\nhaving languages important and also limit their access to those less incline to<br/>\nlearn such based on limited thinking capacity (low intelligence).  I know<br/>\nseveral other roleplaying systems that your intelligence determines the number<br/>\nof languages you can learn.  Just some food for thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nFindar<br/>\nBertoxxulus Server<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear friends from EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wish to divide with you my opinion on languages and how to enchant<br/>\n&gt; everquest using it better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Already in game is included languages, we have Troll, dark elf, halfling,<br/>\n&gt; elf and some secret languages. But what is use of this very important<br/>\n&gt; feature in game?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nearly nonexistent unfortunatly only some magic users use it for reading<br/>\n&gt; some lost magic books in long lost languages and nothing more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In all citys merchants speak common, people in remonte huts talk common,<br/>\n&gt; trolls talk common, elfs a nobile and arrogant race talk common you can go<br/>\n&gt; in every city and every place and all shop vendors speak common ALL PLAYERS<br/>\n&gt; talk perfect common also. So all other languages are nearly never used !!<br/>\n&gt; Why to waste this valuable resurce ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What we can do,  as now in Verant they have under work a new race war<br/>\n&gt; server it will be nice to include this option in new code and enchant this<br/>\n&gt; interesting new idea!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My points to change<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.) I think that some MAX knowelege based on inteligence and wisdom for any<br/>\n&gt; language can be imposted so that you can learn max awaful in dragon if you<br/>\n&gt; have inteligence under 60. It is very strange to have a Troll wich speak<br/>\n&gt; fluent and with melodic elf language or read a long lost book writen in<br/>\n&gt; combine language.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.) all city vendors speak a local language and some rare speak also common<br/>\n&gt; in some degre. In some citys arogant high elfs can speak only their<br/>\n&gt; languages and will not hear any of  beast races languages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.) All players start with a race language based on total inteligence and<br/>\n&gt; wisdom and common in some degre but not at maximum. On base of class i will<br/>\n&gt; add some rare aditional languages but only for casters some base of<br/>\n&gt; languages at wich are writen a basic spell books.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4.) all aditional lv of spells can be only writen if you have enough<br/>\n&gt; knowelege in language on wich a scroll is writen. This can create a<br/>\n&gt; traduction skills to translate spells from one language to another and so<br/>\n&gt; on. Some paterns instructions can be in a specific language.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5.) In spell research you must have a tome with instruction in one hand and<br/>\n&gt; a combine book in another and to create new spell is checked not only your<br/>\n&gt; skill but also a language knowelege for language in wich is writen a book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 6.) Npc will nor reply on your questions or trade with you if you dont know<br/>\n&gt; a language enough<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This are only some of possible uses of languages and there are many more im<br/>\n&gt; shure that some can be easily implemented right from start and others will<br/>\n&gt; require much work and maybe will not enter in game untio a everquest 2 but<br/>\n&gt; i think that here is hiden posibility to make a new profondity to this<br/>\n&gt; great game .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Silverion<br/>\n&gt; High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt; Fenin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; moderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
