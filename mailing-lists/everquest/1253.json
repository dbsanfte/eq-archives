If a major item drops, we normally have it go to whomever will use it<br/>\nfirst.  If no one will use it as a primary item, then it is rolled on by the<br/>\ngroup.  We allow people to trade up, when better items drop.  Some days we might<br/>\nonly see one or two major items drop.  Then other days, we have seen multiples<br/>\nof items drop and everyone in the party get something good.  It is always that<br/>\nluck element that decides the quality and quantity.  Nowadays, I am more<br/>\nexperienced oriented and fun oriented than loot oriented.  Most of the places I<br/>\ncamp do not drop items that are useable by my class or drop items that are<br/>\nbetter than the items I might already have.  I do not like loot hogs or ninja<br/>\nlooters, but I am not really concern about loot as long as the system is fair<br/>\nand everyone understands and agrees to it ahead of the time.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been ages since I been in a group that use alpha loot or loot to X plat<br/>\nor whatever.  Normally, I really like the king looter system, since it allows me<br/>\nto concentrate on supporting the party and getting mana back up.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side bar, what does FFA stand for.  I know I should know it, but I am not<br/>\nvery good with abbreviations.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom aka Waylorn Dragonsbane, Druid of 58 seasons<br/>\n<br/>\nSu wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems with<br/>\n&gt; loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br/>\n&gt; healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br/>\n&gt; totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>\n&gt; loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they care<br/>\n&gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>\n&gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>\n&gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>\n&gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>\n&gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>\n&gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>\n&gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>\n&gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an expensive<br/>\n&gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>\n&gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>\n&gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>\n&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>\n&gt; Just wondering.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>\n&gt; people cooperate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
