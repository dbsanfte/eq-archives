It applies to all experience<br/>\n&gt; gained in that zone.

Can anyone tell me how this works? Or is it as I assume<br/>\n&gt; and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an XP bonus for each kill made in that zone?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
