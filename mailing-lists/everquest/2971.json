If I hit the button on the front of my computer to turn it<br/>\noff, it tells itself to shut down XP and shuts it down properly.<br/>\nWorks really well when the power goes out and my freaking stupid backup unit<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t keep the monitor on. I used to have a backup that kept the monitor<br/>\non but it died. I wish I could find another one like it.<br/>\nI was playing EQ the other night and a tree fell on my powerlines. :-(<br/>\nIt sucked.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n    I now have windows xp and eq looks even better.  I still use a GeForce 4<br/>\nMX 330 video card but the dirvers for windows xp make it WQHL certified and<br/>\nit works fine.  just thought I would let everyone know.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
