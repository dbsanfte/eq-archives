I use this to build my tailoring <br/>\nskills. Soon I will no longer get exp with these hunts, and I will <br/>\nhave advanced my tailoring as much as possible with craig spiders <br/>\nsilk. So, I am wondering where I can go to make some money.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I can go to Neriak and camp guards for their 2pp bronze <br/>\nweapons, but wonder if there is anything equally profitable which <br/>\nwill also net me some exp and perhaps let me explore some place new. <br/>\n<br/>\nany suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nZeboxorouk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
