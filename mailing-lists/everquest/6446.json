I mean, if<br/>\nyou&#39;re trying to catch up to someone else to be able to group with<br/>\nthem (and you&#39;ve actually gotten a toon above 20 before), then I could<br/>\nsee it.

To me, it&#39;s the journey and<br/>\nlearning to play your character properly.  Nothing irks me more than<br/>\nto group with someone who is level 60, but has no real clue as to how<br/>\nto play their toon.
