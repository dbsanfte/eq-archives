Only once recently have I been in a great group where we managed<br/>\nto keep alpha looting, and even then it was a struggle.  A couple of the<br/>\ntanks complained mightily, until I pointed out that it was my heals keeping<br/>\nthem alive, and if they weren&#39;t going to let me loot every so often then I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t heal them.  Didn&#39;t have to carry the threat through, thank the<br/>\ngods. Not sure if I would have done :-)<br/>\nNot that I&#39;m loot greedy at all, but my characters aren&#39;t twinked and last<br/>\ntime I bought my new spells I couldn&#39;t afford them all.  Am trying to<br/>\nsurvive with fairly crap armour and weapons.  I&#39;m lvl 23 and have about<br/>\n100pp to my name, with more spells to buy next level.<br/>\nThe best group I found was partnering a monk who didn&#39;t want any of the loot<br/>\nat all!<br/>\nHugs<br/>\nDalura (23rd Cleric, Lanys T&#39;Vyl)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 01, 2001 3:16 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] About loot order<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems with<br/>\n&gt; loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br/>\n&gt; healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br/>\n&gt; totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>\n&gt; loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they<br/>\ncare<br/>\n&gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>\n&gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>\n&gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>\n&gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>\n&gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>\n&gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>\n&gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>\n&gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>\nexpensive<br/>\n&gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>\n&gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>\n&gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>\n&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>\n&gt; Just wondering.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>\n&gt; people cooperate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
