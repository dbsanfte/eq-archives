That reminds me, what CAN you do on a horse?<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been told you can med without hitting the sit key. Is that true?<br/>\n&gt; And what else can you NOT do on a horse?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i think &quot;fighter&quot; classes won&#39;t be too happy about horses (the only<br/>\nexception are the lvl 60 pallies and sks: summon horse as skill).<br/>\n<br/>\nmy mage and cleric have horses, because of the following reasons:<br/>\n - better mana regen than standing<br/>\n - less aggro (you are sort of standing not sitting)<br/>\n - cast and mem other spells without sitting down, standing up<br/>\n<br/>\nespecially if you are in a raid situation (45+ zones, especially planes)<br/>\nit is better to be on horse, because you can&#39;t sit down to mem another<br/>\nspell without getting aggro. the better mana regen rate really kicks in<br/>\nwhen you also have C3. so you can really say, horses (or mounts) are<br/>\nsort of a must for spell users doing raids.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe main problems with horses:<br/>\n - non-small races on horses are large... very large... a shrink is a must<br/>\n   in raid situiations when there isn&#39;t much room<br/>\n - small races on horses (like gnomes) look pretty stupid! a mounted<br/>\n   gnome can ride between the legs of a mounted troll without &quot;ducking&quot;.<br/>\n - you can&#39;t duck ... and moving to interrupt a spell isn&#39;t that nice/easy<br/>\n - moving/targeting/looting has to be &quot;learned&quot;... it is sort of clumsy and<br/>\n   you have to get used to it<br/>\n (- there were bugs where mounted people couldn&#39;t be healed)<br/>\n<br/>\nin non-raid situations, i prefer jboots to horses: instant click; horses<br/>\ntake<br/>\nsome time to get summoned (and you can get interrupted).<br/>\n<br/>\nnecros can use their skelly form on a horse, but i don&#39;t think druids<br/>\ncan change into wolf form, but i am not sure about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  - bilt<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik, lvl 57 gnome magician, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
