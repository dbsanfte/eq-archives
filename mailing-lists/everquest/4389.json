","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-405555580\">You might try the casters realm site to get the details and <br/>\nstrategies for your class. I haven&#39;t developed this class, so I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave any background to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know the fear factor. Actually, that is one of the aspects of <br/>\nthis style of gaming that makes playing worthwhile. In console games, <br/>\nyour character and story line are generally created for you. If you <br/>\nsave often enough, trying something dangerous costs you nothing but <br/>\nthe time it takes to learn how to solve the puzzle or beat the boss.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this game, you invest time and effort to create your character. <br/>\nYou have an investment to protect. I know that I am cautious going <br/>\ninto new situations, not wanting to die and risk losing all that I <br/>\nhave invested. Sometimes the risk is just a corpse run. Sometimes you <br/>\ncan get yourself into a situation where you will need high-level help <br/>\nto get out, and that help cannot always be found. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thrill of facing these risks, learning to overcome real danger, <br/>\nand learning how to capitalize on every new situation is what makes <br/>\nthis game worth playing. You aren&#39;t just learning to twitch faster on <br/>\nyour controls. You think, plan, and design your own adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dawn&quot; &lt;dawn_marie@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I am new here, my sister recommended this group to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a question. I enjoy being an Enchantress because I am <br/>\nlooking <br/>\n&gt; forward to some of the cool spells that I will eventually get <br/>\n(Charm, <br/>\n&gt; KEI, etc.) I just made Level 10 and am scared to death now because <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m afraid of getting killed, not being able to get back to my <br/>\n&gt; corpse, and losing all my stuff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I joined a website that lists quests and the levels you can <br/>\ncomplete <br/>\n&gt; the quests at, the site says you can complete the Stein of Moggok <br/>\n&gt; quest at level 8. I have components to make a Stein of Moggok, have <br/>\n&gt; the book to get another Stein, but when I try to give bartender <br/>\nClurg <br/>\n&gt; the book, his body guard knocks me on my butt. And I can&#39;t use the <br/>\n&gt; Dark Elf Ill. spell until level 12, so why does everyone say that <br/>\nyou <br/>\n&gt; can finish the quest at 8?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are there any other quests that low-level Enchantress&#39;s can do to <br/>\nget <br/>\n&gt; nice equipment, money and experience?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please help a lady out? Thanks much. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
