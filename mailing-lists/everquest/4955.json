Anyways, I know that one of the <br/>\nlargest guilds out there, Sisterhood of the Rose??, is all female <br/>\ntoons, and like 300+ members.  I don&#39;t know how many are actual <br/>\nfemale gamers.  I can tell you that three of the best gamers I play <br/>\nwith are women.  They are guildmates, and I know they&#39;re female <br/>\nbecause their significant others are also in the guild.  They have <br/>\nall been playing a LONG time and know the game well.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood to know threads don&#39;t always have to be about critical gaming <br/>\nstrategies. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Richard&quot; &lt;soulfire18_01@y...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Me and my friend were having a discussion the other night while he <br/>\n&gt; was playing eq, he was talking to his eq wife, and i was messing <br/>\n&gt; with him, and if brought up the questions of, are there really <br/>\n </span></blockquote>girls <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; that play eq, or are the all guys.
