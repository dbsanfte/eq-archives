Take the entrance from<br/>\nShadeweaver&#39;s Thicket, though. First, you can start by killing the weakest<br/>\ncreatures near the entrance. Around 15th, you can move in and fight the<br/>\nplerg fiends until the XP starts slowing down. After that, move in deeper to<br/>\nkill the phlarg fiends. That can easily sustain you until close to 20th<br/>\nlevel. I think I managed to hunt there with my ranger off and on until<br/>\naround 22nd (I bounced back and forth from Lake of Ill Omen to Paludal<br/>\nCaverns).<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Techpriest [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:techpriest@...\">techpriest@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: December 18, 2003 8:56 PM<br/>\nTo: EverQuest (E-mail)<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Hangouts for teens<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am fairly new to EQ and have been trying various class-race combos to see<br/>\nwhat I like.  I now have three character between level 10 and 15.  I have<br/>\nbeen going to Crushbone alot to hunt, and the tower in the field of bone is<br/>\ncool but I am getting tired of the same old stuff.  Where else can a<br/>\ncharacter in the 10-20 range go to hunt where he can find a group easily?  I<br/>\nhave looked over the EQ Atlas and see a lot of stuff for 1-10 and 30+.<br/>\nSince I may try some more class-race combos before I try and take anybody<br/>\nover 20 I could use some more places to fill the gap between newbie and<br/>\nexperienced.  I am not interested in power-leveling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have EQ Evolution, so every expansion but LDON.  I play on the Tunare<br/>\n(sp?) server.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
