It may slow down initial loads a bit, and every time you enter a<br/>\nnew zone for the first time (overall, not per session) it makes the cache<br/>\nfile, but once your files are made, it REALLY speeds things up. I zone much<br/>\nmore quicker than I used to, in most cases. I also rarely get dropped<br/>\nzoning, unless the server is already iffy. Also, since you have loads of<br/>\nroom....set your VM manually. 2x real ram + 50 megs in 9x/ME, 4x + 50 in 2k<br/>\nor XP, both min and max. I tend to get around a 10-12% boost with this<br/>\ntweak. Last but not least...get a better vid card.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: apcooper &lt;apc@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;EverQuest@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 08, 2003 5:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Slow load and zoning<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello - just joined this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son is very a very enthusiastic EQ player, but is constantly<br/>\n&gt; frustrated by the initial loading times (about 10 minutes) and in<br/>\n&gt; particular time to go from one zone to the next - about five minutes<br/>\n&gt; on average. Very often it crashes back to the server screen after a<br/>\n&gt; long wait.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The PC is a PII 450 with 384Mb RAM and a 60GB hard disk, 90% of which<br/>\n&gt; is free. The graphics card is a 16MB nVidia Riva TNT. Internet<br/>\n&gt; connection is a fast 512Kbs ADSL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is this normal with EQ, and if not, how long should it take to load<br/>\n&gt; and zone? What can be done to really speed things up?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
