EQ Atlas is a good resource, however their<br/>\nmaps aren&#39;t the best IMHO. One, they need to be consistence and have one<br/>\nmap that they update off the other maps they have. Two, No cartoony<br/>\nmaps. It makes things a little too confusing; And three, Add a legend to<br/>\nthe maps and include a N S E W compass. I&#39;m not saying they suck, just<br/>\nwould like to see some improvements. Hopefully Verant&#39;s will be more<br/>\nconsistent. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the dual monitor, It&#39;s easy, just have a second video card<br/>\ninstalled and run EQ on one and your other info on the other. You may<br/>\nhave to tweak the settings a little but that shouldn&#39;t be hard to do.<br/>\nThe monitors can be mapped to do this. <br/>\n<br/>\nC-ya!<br/>\nSteve<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n Message: 1<br/>\n   Date: Mon, 26 Aug 2002 14:00:51 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;mlockridge01&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Forthcoming Atlas<br/>\n<br/>\nI will probably buy the forthcoming atlas, once it is out. It will be <br/>\ncheaper than printing up the rest of the maps I don&#39;t have, since I <br/>\nhave been only printing maps as I need them. Plus, we ran out of ink <br/>\nand nobody in my household wants to be the one to spring for the new <br/>\nink. Probably because they know a large number of maps will be <br/>\nprinted as soon as the ink is loaded. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would really like is to have eq in a window, with a second <br/>\nmonitor to hold my data; maps, charts, lists, and recipes. I know <br/>\nthere is a hack to allow this, but I would prefer a sanctioned <br/>\nwindow. Plus I don&#39;t have the horsepower on this system to carry such <br/>\na load. My game would suffer.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwenty bucks for the atlas sounds cheaper all round.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
