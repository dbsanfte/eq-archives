A kind<br/>\nnecro helped me in exchange for me giving him some pieces of velium. He<br/>\nlocated Tanik for me, and I handed in the thurg gate potion. :-)<br/>\nI have 75 crystalline threads. I need to start combining them to make fibers<br/>\nand then combine with teh wurm bile. But my tailoring is only 52. So I need<br/>\nto work on that first. Anyone know of a quick relatively easy way to go up<br/>\nin tailoring? I&#39;m having a hard time finding supplies for it.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Congrats on the shawl progress. I just came across those a while back<br/>\n&gt; in my research for mid-level wish list items. Not ready yet, but I<br/>\n&gt; think the shawls makes a cool quest series. Lot of work. Good luck on<br/>\n&gt; the rest of them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I really like to find the lvl 1s who just logged in and don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their guild is.
