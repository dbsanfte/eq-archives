As a druid, I <br/>\ninitiated most of my trade skills in my teens. I make some items I <br/>\nneed, make some for alts and an occasional customer. Other than a few <br/>\nspecial items, the trade items are not so profitable as I think they <br/>\nwere intended to be. Some of the ethnic items are very nice, and <br/>\npotentially profitable. Unfortunately, they are very high level and <br/>\nwill require lots of travel into dangerous places.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a caster I must earmark much of my money for spells. Once I know I <br/>\nhave enough for my new set of spells, I begin dumping some money into <br/>\ntrade skills. I do shop for items now and then, but the good stuff <br/>\ncost a lot. I prefer to dump that money into trade skills, and plan <br/>\non making some nice stuff over the course of my career.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;bigmaca3&quot; &lt;bigmaca3@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;dnelle74&quot; &lt;dnelle74@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is it going to kill my bank account or what?  I also want to make <br/>\n&gt; &gt; arrowheads for my Fletching skill.  I think it would be cheaper.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What do u all think?  I&#39;ve been to eqtraders.com.  I&#39;d just like <br/>\n&gt; your <br/>\n&gt; &gt; opinions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When they first came out I also thought about making my own <br/>\n&gt; arrowheads.  Arrowheads go trivial at 41.  They might be good to <br/>\n&gt; raise your skill to that point but are cheaper to buy.  And there&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; no failures when you buy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But the new Condensed substance arrowheads are a reason to build <br/>\nyour <br/>\n&gt; smithing skill, as are the acrylia shafts.  The problem is all that <br/>\n&gt; stuff is on the moon and it is in high level zones, except the <br/>\n&gt; acrylia which is on mid-level mobs.  And they are all highly prized <br/>\n&gt; thus hard to find.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for money, until the recent patch you could master blacksmithing <br/>\n&gt; for under 100 plat if you had decent int.  Now most of the skill <br/>\n&gt; building stuff, like skewers, top out in the 50&#39;s.  So you&#39;re stuck <br/>\n&gt; having to make armor, and that&#39;s an expensive way to go.  And since <br/>\nI <br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t seen anyone looking for a smith in months it&#39;s probably <br/>\n&gt; unprofitable.  I can&#39;t remember the last time I saw someone in <br/>\nbanded <br/>\n&gt; or even plate.  Everyone is in drop armor, or now their newbie <br/>\narmor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Luckily my guys mastered smithing a while ago.  It looks like <br/>\n&gt; smithing will be expensive now, unless you find a lot of dropped <br/>\n&gt; stuff to work with.
