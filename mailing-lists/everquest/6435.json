It has been a long time since I have seriously <br/>\nplayed, I have returned for brief periods, but nothing fulltime. My <br/>\nfirst question is..is there some npc you can go to ( or some other <br/>\nmethod) that will tell you what you faction is...ya know..who like you <br/>\nand who doesnt. It has been a long time and I dont recall who and what <br/>\nfactions I was building and destroying. Im thinking its as easy as the <br/>\nseer in PoK that tells you what steps are needed for Planar progression.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and btw... in my sheer boredom, i went through the EQ file and <br/>\nhooked all the songs from the different zones so they&#39;d play in their <br/>\nown playlist on my media player. If you listen to them all in series <br/>\nlike this, it actually isnt a bad soundtrack. Just thought id let you <br/>\nall in on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAS always,<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
