I would<br/>\ngreatly appreciate any feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  How does &quot;sneak&quot; work exactly?  Can I sneak across someone&#39;s line of<br/>\nsight?  What is the difference between &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; that comes later?<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.  Does it do me any good to<br/>\nattack monsters from behind without the ability yet?  I have been making an<br/>\neffort to do just that, but should I not even bother?<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot recall<br/>\nhaving ever seen or heard of a trap in EQ.  Can anyone give an example of<br/>\nwhere and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>\nthere is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Alazais&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
