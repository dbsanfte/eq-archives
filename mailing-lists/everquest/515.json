Sometimes you will see a<br/>\n&gt; goblin swimming at the mouth of the cave.  The cave itself is inside<br/>\n&gt; the mountain, so as you swim it will eventauly open up above the<br/>\n&gt; surface of the water.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe that the NPC Necro&#39;s con was aggressive and he was red at<br/>\n&gt; lvl 16.  Be careful when approaching him.  BTW there is very little<br/>\n&gt; light, and it is a maze ( oh what fun... hehe)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I never zoned so i dont believe its a new zone, just undiscovered..<br/>\n&gt; the cave itself is quite large (or it seemed that way) but was<br/>\n&gt; relativly empty. This is what i saw:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.. House with 4 icebone skeletons<br/>\n&gt; 2.. Shrine ( zone point )structure protected by 2 icebones skeletons<br/>\n&gt; 3.. Human NPC Necromancer with pet  - red at lvl 16<br/>\n&gt; 4.. Possible Giant.. (type unknown) - I never saw one myself<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And, there could be more to the cave that went unexplored, because i<br/>\n&gt; had no way of passing the Necro at the time. I was informed of the<br/>\n&gt; cave by a fellow player.  She stated that she had seen a giant, but<br/>\n&gt; alass i have not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good Luck<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
