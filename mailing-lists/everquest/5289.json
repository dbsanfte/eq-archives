I play on the Tunare server.  I have a 13<br/>\n&gt; Iksar Monk but have been playing my 5 Wood Elf Ranger lately.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My ranger has a quiver that he keeps his arrows in.  I saw a tip when<br/>\n&gt; I logged on that says keeping arrows in a quiver decreases attack<br/>\n&gt; time.  I can not get him to draw from his quiver.  The only arrows he<br/>\n&gt; uses are in the ammo slot.  The quiver will not fit in the ammo slot.<br/>\n&gt; If I have no arrows in the ammo slot I get a message &quot;Out Of<br/>\n&gt; Ammunition&quot; when I try and use my bow, even with my quiver full.  I<br/>\n&gt; have tried putting the quiver on my back and it won&#39;t fit there<br/>\n&gt; either.  I have asked a bunch of people in game with no luck,<br/>\n&gt; searched the web and looked in my hint book.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Put a stack of arrows in your ammo slot, and a quiver in your inventory.<br/>\nYou get haste just by having the quiver, and if you have more than one<br/>\nquiver it uses the haste from the one nearest the top left slot in your<br/>\ninventory. It doesn&#39;t matter if the arrows are being drawn from a stack<br/>\nin your quiver or another back, it just looks for a quiver to see if you<br/>\nget any haste.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have shot the last arrow in your ammo slot it looks for a stack<br/>\nof *identical* arrows sored in your inventory, and if it finds any it<br/>\nmoves a single arrow from your inventory to the ammo slot. If it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nfind an identical arrow, your get an out of ammo message, even if you<br/>\nare carrying lots of other types of arrows. To use these other arrows<br/>\nyou would need to put at least one into the ammo slot manually.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; While on the subject of archers, my bow and arrows each have a range<br/>\n&gt; and damage rating.  My bow is Range 75 Damage 8 (I think).  My arrows<br/>\n&gt; are Range 25 Damage 1.  What is my range and damage?  100 and 9 by<br/>\n&gt; adding the numbers, 25 and 1 taking the lower of each?  Something<br/>\n&gt; else?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You add the numbers for damage and range from both bow and arrow in use<br/>\nto get the final result. A 3 damage 150 range Arrow with a 20damage 200<br/>\nrange bow gives 23 base damage and 350 range<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\nHunter Honig Wayfarer<br/>\n65 Forest Stalker (Ranger)<br/>\nCazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.542 / Virus Database: 336 - Release Date: 18/11/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
