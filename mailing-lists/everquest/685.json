I know the rangers is ivy etched, and the druid im guessing.<br/>\nThe temple of solosek ro, is through lava storm.  Inside there is the three spellcasters and bards<br/>\ni know the enchanters have wand, mask, and gloves.   The magician has robes and some other stuff.  OTHER! equipment is available there.  As well as a few clerical items.  If anyone wants to go through and start naming who gives what and how.  I have taken screen shots of what the enchanter person has said.  But other then what he said thats it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNefertina<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Avron Elselynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avron@...\">avron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqpaladin@onelist.com\">eqpaladin@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Wednesday, October 13, 1999 5:25 PM<br/>\n    Subject: [EverQuest] Rubicite replacement armor<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    I would like to hear reports of any and all armor that replaces rubicite, stats, where quests start etc..<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Oh and does anyone know what level you need to be to go to the new zone Temple of Solusek Ro?<br/>\n    <br/>\n    - Avron -</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
