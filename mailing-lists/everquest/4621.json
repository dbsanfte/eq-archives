I am in AWE of you people even<br/>\n&gt; though I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; understand half of what you say. I long for the day<br/>\n&gt; when I can talk <br/>\n&gt; about the finer ponts of EQ like you guys. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the moment I have a love/hate relationship with<br/>\n&gt; EQ after playing <br/>\n&gt; for about two months or so. Its a type of game I<br/>\n&gt; have never <br/>\n&gt; experienced before - I am totally fascinated and<br/>\n&gt; mildly (well, at the <br/>\n&gt; moment!) addicted. The game boths thrills and scares<br/>\n&gt; me. I find <br/>\n&gt; myself nervously approaching the PC every night<br/>\n&gt; mentally preparing <br/>\n&gt; myself for the dangers ahead. Once I&#39;m in, I am<br/>\n&gt; immersed. GET THAT <br/>\n&gt; LEVEL UP is my only goal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I levelled 10 I knew that I was going to have<br/>\n&gt; to deal with REAL <br/>\n&gt; dying and corpse retrieval. Boy, that was - and<br/>\n&gt; still is  - a <br/>\n&gt; learning experience. The first few times I got so<br/>\n&gt; depressed that I <br/>\n&gt; vowed to give up and cancel my subscription. But I<br/>\n&gt; crawled to lvl 11 <br/>\n&gt; and am much more careful about conning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By nature I am not a team player so grouping is<br/>\n&gt; still a bit alien to <br/>\n&gt; me although I realise its the only fast way to get<br/>\n&gt; xp. But too often <br/>\n&gt; I find myself in groups that just gung ho for<br/>\n&gt; everything in sight <br/>\n&gt; hitting anything that moves (= Excelsis having to<br/>\n&gt; retrive his corpse <br/>\n&gt; ONCE more in some weird, out of the way loc).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can I ask you guys some questions? I reckon a 1/5<br/>\n&gt; bub a night is <br/>\n&gt; pretty average to aim for. That would lvl me up once<br/>\n&gt; a week. Is that <br/>\n&gt; the norm? How long did it take you in the beginning?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have tried to solo in Black Burrow but that is<br/>\n&gt; well nigh impossible <br/>\n&gt; on your own. Grouping is the only way but I HATE<br/>\n&gt; that place so much <br/>\n&gt; it makes me so nervous to go there. I am soloing in<br/>\n&gt; West Kerana but <br/>\n&gt; grizzly and giant spider spawns are pretty rare so I<br/>\n&gt; spend a lot of <br/>\n&gt; time hanging around and trying to avoid the bandits<br/>\n&gt; (by the way, they <br/>\n&gt; seem to be walking all over WK recently,  not just<br/>\n&gt; around their huts. <br/>\n&gt; Is this new?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any advice and encouragement you can give me is<br/>\n&gt; greatly appreciated. <br/>\n&gt; I know I&#39;m not alone, but sometimes it feels as<br/>\n&gt; though I am! I use <br/>\n&gt; the English server Venril Sathir (I live in<br/>\n&gt; Amsterdam) and sometimes <br/>\n&gt; the zones are completely deserted. Is it like that<br/>\n&gt; on the US servers <br/>\n&gt; as well?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope to hear from some of you anyway, especially<br/>\n&gt; your experiences and <br/>\n&gt; feelings about EQ when you first started. I&#39;m off<br/>\n&gt; again now to that <br/>\n&gt; HUGE VAST world that we all know and love (and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes hate...)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Excelsis<br/>\n&gt; Erudite Paladin 11<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
