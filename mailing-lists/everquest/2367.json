Also, leveling is only part of the <br/>\ngame. Explore trade skills, shopping from vendors, and trading with <br/>\nplayers. Take enough time to learn all you can from your first newbie <br/>\nexperience. Once you have leveled your first character, you may want <br/>\nto power level some of your alternate characters. Or, taking the long <br/>\nroad to leveling for alts may appeal to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake your time. Every level has it&#39;s own challenges and pleasures. <br/>\nHave fun on your EverQuest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nHalfling Druid<br/>\nZeb Server <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Chris Surratt &lt;clrod4u@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a newbe trying to find a good place to level??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Got any ideas??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
