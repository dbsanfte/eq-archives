My deep armor knowledge is<br/>\nconfined to games as primal as UO =) Sooo, if you can do a little<br/>\nexplanation of the general differences between AC and Absorbtion, I would be<br/>\nmost gracious. And also, will I notice a big difference between no armor and<br/>\nmy new Bronze (let&#39;s assume it&#39;s a full suit)? I know it should be an<br/>\nobvious yes, but I have been less than enthralled with armor effects in the<br/>\ngame so far, and am wondering if I&#39;m going to noticed monsters about my<br/>\nlevel that did 20 or so damage suddenly start doing 4 or 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a bunch again,<br/>\n-Rukkak<br/>\n<br/>\n(Just to cover my prospective flame bases, nothin against UO. IT is just my<br/>\npersonal opinion that EQ is faaaaaar better. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael_Wyatt@...\">Michael_Wyatt@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bronze plate, in addition to being extremely heavy, does not<br/>\n&gt;absorb damage as well as normal plate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On the heaviness side - 86lb may not seem like much, until<br/>\n&gt;you factor in that you will be carrying at least 10LB of weapons,<br/>\n&gt;4LB of backpacks, several LB of food and drink, every 40 coins<br/>\n&gt;weighs 1B.
