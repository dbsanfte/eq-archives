Cuz I haven&#39;t.  I&#39;m a total<br/>\nnewbie with a monk.  Never used one, don&#39;t know how I should start<br/>\nwith a monk.  Any of you monk amateurs or experts want to give me<br/>\nsome suggestions how I should start my monk on character creation and<br/>\nonward?  That&#39;ll be great.  And for those who are on Druzzil Ro, you<br/>\ncan help me out too because that&#39;s where I&#39;m gonna be making my<br/>\ncharacter.  I don&#39;t know what my character name is gonna be yet but<br/>\nif you guys want to chat, meet me, or help me on druzzil ro, I would<br/>\nlove to know what your character names are.  Now here&#39;s a question,<br/>\nShould I be a human monk or an iksar monk?  I know there are only two<br/>\nraces you can be for a monk.  Anyway, there I am.  Plus the other<br/>\nreason for making this character is to meet somoene who is going to<br/>\nbe married which I met on Vazaelle.  So she asked if I could go to<br/>\nher wedding.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m making this character but since I&#39;m<br/>\ngonna make a character to meet her, might as well use that character<br/>\nin good use.  I was gonna make a new character anyway on a different<br/>\nserver that has better economy than Vazaelle.  Anyway, I would<br/>\nappreciate the help you guys can give me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
