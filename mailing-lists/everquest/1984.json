He did not tell us to run, nor did<br/>\nhe warn us that he was pulling almost half the zone. I was the main healer.<br/>\nI saw him injured. So I healed him. Next thing I know, everything is on me.<br/>\nI asked the backup healer to help me. Backuphealer did nothing. I died. I<br/>\nwas the only one who died though bc after healing and effectively taunting<br/>\nmobs off the enc, he was able to mez. Right after I repopped after dying a<br/>\nsystem message said half an hour til downtime to patch. So, I memmed spells<br/>\nand was heading back for my corpse. 5 minutes later another system message<br/>\nsaid &quot;Servers coming down, log out now&quot; I know this bc I did a /ti to<br/>\ncompare the times. So what does my group do? Rather than help me, they just<br/>\ncamped and left me there. So now I probably lost all of my stuff. I wish<br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t lie about how long til patch time.<br/>\nSorry, just very frustrated.<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
