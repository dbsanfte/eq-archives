Shaman are extremely important to a raid, from slowing a mob to<br/>\ngiving melee some excellent stat buffs.  High level Rangers put out obscene<br/>\namounts of damage and are able to tank mobs that aggro on casters, while<br/>\nbeing about to almost immedialely reduce aggro when needed.  Mages are<br/>\nexcellent for mana regen (mod rods) and CotH.  Druids are excellent<br/>\nsecondary healers on raid, throwing in heals between CHs.  Monks and SK&#39;s<br/>\nare excellent indoor pullers (breaking Fear is terribly hard without a Monk<br/>\nor SK to scout).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere really isn&#39;t one single class that is not needed in a raid situation.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
