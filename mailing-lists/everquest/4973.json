I&#39;m gonna wait and see about \nall this bc I&#39;ve heard conflicting reports on requirements....several guildies \nof mine claim it has no requirements beyond what current EQ with all expansions \nhas, but a page I saw claims otherwise....much, much higher...and with my \nrelatively old puter I don&#39;t want to&nbsp;end up with something I can&#39;t even \nplay. Once I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t mess up everything for me, then chances are I&#39;ll \nbuy it for the features, and items/spells. I rarely play in the planes \ndue&nbsp;to lag issues (POJ being a notable exception, small hallways are \nsomething my puter handles admirably) and same thing with many Luclin \nzones...ME, TS, and FG are close to a lost cause for me.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div>----- Original Message ----- </div>\n<blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nefrahari@...\"\n title=\"Nefrahari@...\">Nefrahari@...</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Thursday, August 21, 2003 9:04 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Re: What game \n  features would you like to see added?</div>\n  <div><br></div>\n  <div>\n  <div>\n  <div>BUT, with LDoN, this is supposed to be somewhat possible... not \n  necessarily changing the look of things but to give any item special \n  properties.
