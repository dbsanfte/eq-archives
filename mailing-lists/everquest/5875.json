Last spring I bought Evolution thinking I would<br/>\nre-join Norrath.  Well, apparently not!  My system couldn&#39;t handle the change<br/>\non the first of April (no matter what I tried, my sad, tired machine couldn&#39;t deal<br/>\nwith the changes).  So, now I have a new machine that will work with the game<br/>\nand will be getting dsl shortly.   I will be using the game I bought (Evolution) and<br/>\nwould like to know if any of the expansions beyond LoY offer anything for the<br/>\n&#39;new&#39;, young player or if they are mostly for above levels 20, 30, 40, 50 or more?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first played (on a borrowed account to see if I would like it) I couldn&#39;t get<br/>\nout of the room/building where I was created!!!  It was hysterical!  My Mentor had<br/>\nto come get me!  and he was kos in Felwithe!  I definately won&#39;t be repeating <br/>\nthat scenario......LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nStarshyyn (I hope)<br/>\nTarew Marr (soon)<br/>\n(and others)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
