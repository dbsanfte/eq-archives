That is a very <br/>\nfast, memory loaded machine on the new Radeon ubercard. With multiple <br/>\nhard drives in a RAID array.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose machines begin at about $5000. Now I don&#39;t mind driving my <br/>\nHundai Accent a few more years, and paying for such a machine. <br/>\nHowever, my wife may object, as well as some of those who wait each <br/>\nmonth for a piece of my paycheck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if I drop the wife and family, move into a very cheap studio <br/>\napartment, within walking distance of work, I could have my machine <br/>\nwith no trouble at all. But I kind of like the family, so I will <br/>\nstill dream. Perhaps, someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Wulfric Rennison&quot; &lt;wulftech@e...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am running EverQuest on a PIII 800mhz with 1GB of RAM and a ATI <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Radeon 128MB 4X AGP video card.    I never saw any lag on my system <br/>\npre-Luclin.  It&#39;s only when they souped up the game engine for better <br/>\ngraphics that my system started lagging.  Thus the upgrade to more <br/>\nRAM and a better video card.  Now I run on a cable modem.  There&#39;s <br/>\nvirtually no lag on zones that existed prior to Luclin.  There is <br/>\nstill lag on Luclin, but I can turn the clip plane down to nil and <br/>\nturn off spell effects (which are annoying anyway) and get almost no <br/>\nlag at all.   However, same system specs with a 64MB video card and  <br/>\nwas getting major lag in Bazaar.  Now it&#39;s pretty smoothe.  I plan on <br/>\nupgrading the processor to a 1Ghz or better next month so I am sure <br/>\neven Bazaar will be fine.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I still contend that a higher end video card can compensate for a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>low end processor.  But when you&#39;ve got both together, EQ should be <br/>\nflawless.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric/Raido/Celric/Shifu/Sandahl/Savawulf/Ramsen         Cazic <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thule Server<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Pseudowulf        The Seventh Hammer Server<br/>\n&gt; Kenjite/Petrus        Tunare Server<br/>\n&gt; Airbourne            E&#39;ci Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Melanie Johnson <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, January 08, 2003 11:34 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: video cards<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m also running Win ME with 384 megs of ram.
