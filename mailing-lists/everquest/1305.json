I think there were 10 of us and we had 3 tunics.  I had the<br/>\nsecond highest roll.  I also have lost 3 insidious robes by virtue of going<br/>\nLD before we could decide who gets it. I also went LD when my Enchanter Robe<br/>\ndropped in PoG but luckily my brother was in the same room with me on the<br/>\nsame raid and let everyone know I was coming back.  I was one of two<br/>\nenchanters there and it was the other enchanters first time in PoG while I<br/>\nhad been there about a dozen times or so.  I  was awarded that. Once I<br/>\nlogged on I spent the next 3 or 4 minutes trying to loot this HUGE tree, I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find the right place to loot it (it was down by the &quot;feet&quot;, FYI).<br/>\nSeveral times I got the message someone is already looting that corpse was<br/>\nreally beginning to worry.  After several /ooc /shout&#39;s finally got whoever<br/>\nwas crouched on the corpse to get his/her lazy tail off of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nymue Ce&#39;Nedra [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nymue_uberdruid@...\">nymue_uberdruid@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 04, 2001 9:18 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Rolling for loot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Since there&#39;s been a lot of talk on loot order, I<br/>\n&gt; thoguht I&#39;d ask what everyone uses as a fair<br/>\n </span></blockquote>assesment for Rolling for loot or how one determines<br/>\nwho gets a particular item.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way it works on my server (C-T) is seed random<br/>\nrolling.  When a mob drops something worth rolling on,<br/>\nthe leader of the group rolls /random 1000.  Say for<br/>\nexample he gets a 678 ... everyone in the group,<br/>\nincluding the leader, then rolls /random 678.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow why we do it this way but we do :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best roll coup I EVER got was for a locustlure in<br/>\nKarnor Castle.  This item is worth about 7kpp on my<br/>\nserver, by far the best loot I&#39;ve ever seen on a mob<br/>\nin my 48 levels.  I was leader of the group, so I<br/>\nrolled /random 1000.  I got a 227.  So everyone rolls<br/>\n/random 227 and guess what I got on that roll ..<br/>\nthat&#39;s right, a 227.  Talk about WOOT!!!  I was so<br/>\nexcited, I&#39;d NEVER won a roll before on ANYTHING. <br/>\nAnyway, I traded it for Coldain Skin Boots (worth<br/>\nabout 12kpp) a few minutes later (didn&#39;t even have to<br/>\nauction the thing), but it was still the most exciting<br/>\nthing that&#39;s ever happened to me in Everquest .. ok<br/>\nthat&#39;s sad ..<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nymue~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nNymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br/>\nWood Elf Druid, Cazic-Thule Server<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
