I quit <br/>\nabout a year and a half ago when I upgraded to Windows XP. I have a <br/>\nSound Blaster Live (value) card. I had the Shadows of Luclin <br/>\nexpansion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sound effects and ambient sounds were good, but the music was <br/>\nhorribly distorted. I did the usual card driver updates with XP and <br/>\nposted to the Vault and other fan sites. Others with XP and this <br/>\nsound card had the same problem. EQ support emailed me back a <br/>\nresponse that they were aware and were working on the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I consider coming back, I was wondering if anyone had similar <br/>\nproblems and were they solved with the current, new expansion I <br/>\nbelieve is called &quot;Planes of Power&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d hate to invest in the expansion to discover I still can&#39;t have <br/>\nthe music specific to areas within the zones. Any feedback would be <br/>\nappreciated.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
