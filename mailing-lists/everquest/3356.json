As a Halfling tailor, brute hides are a<br/>\n&gt; valuable next step in tailoring. My son recalled finding brutes in<br/>\n&gt; the tunnel to Dalnir, so I went there. Once I do an initial harmony<br/>\n&gt; to draw only one, I am able to root, dot, dot, root, nuke with<br/>\n&gt; surprising ease. With a respawn of about 15 minutes I can keep<br/>\n&gt; farming these for quite a while as I build my tailoring skills making<br/>\n&gt; Halfling Vale leather armor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Experience is not great, but since I will be working on trade skills<br/>\n&gt; as I farm, the time making lvl 34 will be well spent here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once I have gotten tired of farming here I will try Frontier<br/>\n&gt; Mountains.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
