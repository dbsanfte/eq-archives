The spells to <br/>\nget to start with is locate corpse (saves you hours when you die, I found <br/>\nNektulos forest to be very confusing to start with).  Most people would say <br/>\nget the 1st level skeleton spell, however I never bothered with it.  level <br/>\n1 to 4 is easy enough, you will die a few times, but not that often - the <br/>\nbiggest problem is the beetles who may gang up on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSense the dead is also useful - save every bone chip you pick up, don&#39;t <br/>\nsell them - you need them for your skeleton at level 4!  Disease cloud is <br/>\nuseful - doesn&#39;t seem to damage your target much, but they don&#39;t seem to <br/>\nheal either - and it improves conjuration which is good for your skeletal <br/>\npets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest problem with nektulos is that there aren&#39;t any shops there - <br/>\nthe first thing you should buy is a backpack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s it really - if you need any help and I&#39;m online feel free to ask me <br/>\nany questions, I&#39;d be pleased to help.  I&#39;m bound in Qeynos at the moment, <br/>\nbut I can give advice easily enough.  When you reach level 8 or so and you <br/>\nstart adventuring into the commons, don&#39;t go near any human npc&#39;s - they&#39;ll <br/>\nattack you on sight.  That&#39;s the biggest disadvantage to being a dark elf - <br/>\nnobody likes you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anybody in Qeynos needs help finding any corpses, please ask me - I&#39;ll <br/>\nbe glad to help, and I only ask for some food and water as payment :-) <br/>\n They really should start selling food and water in the necromancers guild!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\nMored<br/>\n10th level Dark Elf Necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tNick [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brutalny@...\">brutalny@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\t02 June 1999 15:23<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[EverQuest] necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\nI just rolled up a dark elf necromancer.
