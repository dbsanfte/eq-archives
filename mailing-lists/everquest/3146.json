He was seeking a tailor to make the new 100% weight reduction<br/>\n&gt; bags.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I told him I was a level 80 tailor, and level 70 smith. After not<br/>\n&gt; finding anyone better, he and I went to the Vale Forge to try to make<br/>\n&gt; the Vale Sewing Kit I would need. As getting parts for this kit<br/>\n&gt; happens to be my present goal, I was delighted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He had parts for five tries. In five tries I failed five times, but<br/>\n&gt; gained three levels. Not bad for me, but unfortunate for my new<br/>\n&gt; friend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I gained also in learning how to get my hq metal bits. I have been<br/>\n&gt; seeking the ore, but he suggested reverse-engineering fine steel<br/>\n&gt; weapons. He said a fs weapon, flask of water, and chisel can break<br/>\n&gt; down the fs weapon to the component parts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He suggested Hill Giants in Raith Mountains as a good source of fs<br/>\n&gt; weapons to work with. I am nearly leveled enough for that adventure,<br/>\n&gt; and so I may direct my efforts to leveling a bit so I may follow this<br/>\n&gt; advice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone know of other good hunting which nets fine steel drops? I<br/>\n&gt; expect that my quest to make my Vale Sewing Kit will raise my<br/>\n&gt; experience and my smithing levels quite nicely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And about reverse engineering. Anyone know much about this? For<br/>\n&gt; example, I looted a chainmail tunic in Permafrost, but it was too<br/>\n&gt; large for my alts to use. However, if I could break it down into<br/>\n&gt; parts and remake it with the correct pattern for a small character, I<br/>\n&gt; could come out ahead. Any idea if this works?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nFine steel drops off of Tae Ew mobs in Feerott near the Cazic Thule entrance<br/>\nand off of pickclaw warriors and raiders in Highkeep. I think some sand and<br/>\nhill giants drop fine steel as well. Rathe mountains has wonderful loot.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
