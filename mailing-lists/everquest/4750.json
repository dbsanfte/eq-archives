Back before \nthe nerf of KEI and other group buff spells not meant to be cast on the younger \nplayers&nbsp;you could have almost endless mana as a younger player and that was \ndefinitely not how the game was designed.&nbsp; I mean I would just log in my \nhigh lvl mage group with a newly made char on my other acct cast a 45 point \ndamage shield on the lvl 1 character and be lvl 30 with in a matter of \nhours,&nbsp; after that with KEI and other PL&#39;ing tools I could make lvl 50 with \nin a couple of days, I think PL&#39;ing in it self is much to powerful of a tool \nright now, I do&nbsp;power level my characters on occasion but I wish they could \nfind a way to tone that power down it makes the game a bit to easy.&nbsp; Good \nLuck with the letter, and if you do quit, I shall say we&#39;ll probably see you \nback in the game in a few months.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Nak </font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
