My mistake with my shaman was  getting more of the Wis<br/>\nitems to build up my mana, however I always tried to find stuff that<br/>\nincluded an addition to my mana with  &quot;x&quot; amount of mana to try and balance<br/>\nit out.  Unfortunately the price of things in the bazaar tended to deplete<br/>\nmy funds for tradeskills like &quot;Alchemy&quot; (still can&#39;t believe the prices for<br/>\nmaking those durned potions) but the more my wis  ultimately led to the<br/>\nbetter my success rates in making my  tradeskill items. But I digress. Most<br/>\npeople will tell you put more into the mana pool and forget about the mana<br/>\nregenerator ability. In Ya&#39;lls case Intelligence. Others will tell you the<br/>\nexact opposite cause they say that you will regenerate your mana pool faster<br/>\nas well as increase it per level.
