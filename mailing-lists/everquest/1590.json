Or in cases where harassment<br/>\nleads to one player purposely pulling a train of high lvl mobs onto lower<br/>\nlvl characters and getting them killed on purpose just to harass one of the<br/>\nlower lvl characters in that area?<br/>\nIs this high priority or low or what?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; If you look at the matter seriously you&#39;ll find 100k+<br/>\n&gt; players on a day with only 10 average support staff<br/>\n&gt; per server (includes guides, senior guides and GMs)<br/>\n&gt; they do become overwhelmed at times.  Behind the<br/>\n&gt; scenes they do a great job supporting the EQ community<br/>\n&gt; as a whole.  The turn over rate for guides, the<br/>\n&gt; mainstay of Verant&#39;s CS staff is rather high.  This<br/>\n&gt; makes it difficult to have a smooth flowing CS<br/>\n&gt; operation staff on a regular basis.  The rate is high<br/>\n&gt; due to a few reasons:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. It&#39;s difficult for most to play and be a guide.<br/>\n&gt; 2. Some can&#39;t handle the workload average 100-200<br/>\n&gt; petitions a shift (depending on shift hours, time of<br/>\n&gt; day,  etc.).<br/>\n&gt; 3. Burn out<br/>\n&gt; 4. Some just get tired of irate players =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They are constantly retraining new support staff and<br/>\n&gt; attempt to provide the best possible assistance.   To<br/>\n&gt; me it&#39;s amazing at all someone gets a petition<br/>\n&gt; answered.   How many other games out there even<br/>\n&gt; attempt to support 200k+ users with direct online<br/>\n&gt; face-to-face access to a support staff on a 24hour<br/>\n&gt; basis.   Hehe. Hey if you feel the system has a<br/>\n&gt; problem join the CS staff and try and change the<br/>\n&gt; system for the better.   I dare ya.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just FYI - To process a surname request:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Apprentice/Guide answers a petition and takes down<br/>\n&gt; your information.<br/>\n&gt; 2. Boots up your petition to a higher level and waits<br/>\n&gt; in the queue till a Senior/GM can make the change.<br/>\n&gt; GMs work on a 5 day on 2 day off schedule.  Senior<br/>\n&gt; Guides are not always available.   They do have SWAT<br/>\n&gt; GMs however a surname change would not fall under<br/>\n&gt; emergency support.<br/>\n&gt; 3. Your request also gets posted to a bulletin board<br/>\n&gt; after the Guides shift to be handled as soon as<br/>\n&gt; possible.<br/>\n&gt; 4. Either a Senior Guide fulfilled a request from the<br/>\n&gt; Board or you were lucky enough to have one online the<br/>\n&gt; second time you petitioned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW. Problems like name changes. guides don&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt; ability to make the change, so its normal to not have<br/>\n&gt; it acted upon immediately.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; D.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
