Like <br/>\nkill the orcs in EC to get into freeport but you will never be able <br/>\nto get into north freeport because they are on a different faction <br/>\nfrom the rest of the city.  I also think you cant get into rivervale <br/>\nand qeynos and i dont think anyone can get into paineel without being <br/>\nkos</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
