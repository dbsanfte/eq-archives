I have played for 2+<br/>\nyears and still develop my play style today.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Techpriest &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:techpriest@...\">techpriest@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Quick answer, no I have not seen it.  Most of this<br/>\n&gt; info can be found on web,<br/>\n&gt; they just lump it one place.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Item locations and quests can be found at<br/>\n&gt; www.everquest.allakhazam.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Trade skill info is all at www.eqtraders.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maps can be found at www.eqatlas.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Using Kazaa Lite (not plain Kazaa, it will jack up<br/>\n&gt; your PC) I found a ton of<br/>\n&gt; EQ cheat, hack plat-making, etc guides.  I<br/>\n&gt; downloaded some and if they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; involve anything illegal I would be willing to post<br/>\n&gt; them to the files<br/>\n&gt; section of the group for those that don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; mess with file-sharing<br/>\n&gt; programs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For $5 less then the guide you can buy 10,000 plat<br/>\n&gt; if that is what you want.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Be careful with power-leveling.  It is a great way<br/>\n&gt; to make a high-leveled<br/>\n&gt; character that is pretty useless.  In some games it<br/>\n&gt; works great since the<br/>\n&gt; only way to increase skills is to gain a level. <br/>\n&gt; When people come to EQ they<br/>\n&gt; do it and end with with a level 30 char with no<br/>\n&gt; skills.  You get 5 points<br/>\n&gt; for leveling, I normally get 100 - 150 skill points<br/>\n&gt; while gaining my level.<br/>\n&gt; How are you going to make up for all those lost<br/>\n&gt; points?  You do boring stuff<br/>\n&gt; over and over and over, that&#39;s how.  When I get to<br/>\n&gt; level 30 I won&#39;t need to<br/>\n&gt; spend hours working my safe fall, bind wounds, or<br/>\n&gt; dodge, I use them all the<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am also concerned about the PDFs.  How often are<br/>\n&gt; they updated?  I have<br/>\n&gt; several of the published EQ guides I have gotten<br/>\n&gt; from book store discount<br/>\n&gt; racks and much of the stuff in them is flat out<br/>\n&gt; wrong.  The game is always<br/>\n&gt; changing and the websites change with it, my books<br/>\n&gt; do not.  Do these guides<br/>\n&gt; get updated with every patch?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
