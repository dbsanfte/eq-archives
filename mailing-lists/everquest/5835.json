This would normally not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-672455220\">I agree - even at lower levels the missions are tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy level 12 enchanter was recently sent to Unrest to kill 10 <br/>\nTormented Dead.   This would normally not be too big a deal, as they <br/>\ncon mostly DB to me. the problem is the Death Beetles that wander <br/>\naround the outside that all aggro on you when you attack one of the <br/>\ndead.   I died once, and had to train three times to zone - and this <br/>\nwas a &quot;medium mission&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one before was incredibly easy - I had to run to the center of a <br/>\ngoblin camp, I had to run to pok, then I had to speak to someone in <br/>\nfield of bone.  All easy actions for a level 12 enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I do have to somewhat defend the system.  I believe these quests <br/>\nmay be soloable, but they require intense skill.  I am not very <br/>\nskilled with my enchanter yet, which may be why I&#39;m having a <br/>\nproblem. (I am not implying anything about anyone elses play skill - <br/>\nthis is just my observation on my characters)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also recieved a mission for my level 51 shaman to go to lower guk <br/>\nand kill 10 Dar Ghoul Knights.  I had never been to Lower Guk, and I <br/>\nhonestly enjoyed it down there - I made nearly 100 pp from killing <br/>\nthe greenies and picked up some items that I have sold in the bazaar <br/>\nfor an extra 250 pp.  I am very skilled with my shaman, as he is the <br/>\nthird one I have ever had.  So the mission doesn&#39;t seem as bad <br/>\n(though still very hard).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have sent feedback, there are some things I want them to implement:<br/>\n<br/>\n** Titles for people who complete a large number of missions<br/>\n** Adventure points of some sort would be nice - get rewards other <br/>\nthan just plat (I would like a trophey).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind them being hard - I just want to have something more <br/>\ntangible to prove I did it, besides some xp and money (though maybe <br/>\nI been playing to much fable).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I tried to get some tasks with my 65 cleric but all of the &quot;short&quot; <br/>\ntasks started in sebilis. I don&#39;t like working my way to sebilis. <br/>\nAnd I know I can&#39;t solo the mobs there. I think we should feedback <br/>\nand request they have some tasks that actually ARE soloable.<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve now got a couple of my characters working on tasks. My 49 <br/>\nranger was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;advised by the task masters to go to Rathe Mountains for a task. <br/>\nI did, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;everything was pointing me to Lower Guk. I&#39;ve never really been <br/>\nthrough<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Upper and Lower Guk, and going that far underground with a ranger <br/>\njust makes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;me concerned.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I abandoned the task. The next thing I tried was getting a task <br/>\nfrom a task<br/>\n&gt; &gt;master in Overthere. It sent me into Burning Woods, where one of <br/>\nthe things<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I had to do was enter the giant fort and scout it out. To <br/>\naccomplish that, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;discovered I had to run into the middle of the fort. I was <br/>\ninvisible, but as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;soon as I got within agrro range, I started wailed on by a giant.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thankfully, a group was pulling giants from the fort, so it was <br/>\nsomewhat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;abandoned. I trained a giant or two out and ran for the zone <br/>\nline. The next<br/>\n&gt; &gt;step is to kill 10 skeletons (can&#39;t remember exactly what type, <br/>\nbut I know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they con dark blue -- not sure how well bow-kiting will work in <br/>\nsuch a busy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;zone).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Frustrated with such difficult and dangerous tasks for my 49 <br/>\nranger, I tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a task with 10 cleric. I was sent into Innothule Swamp from a PoK <br/>\ntask<br/>\n&gt; &gt;master and told to kill 10 bull alligators (most con white, some <br/>\na healthy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dark blue). I had to run for my life and died about 10 feet from <br/>\nthe PoK<br/>\n&gt; &gt;book. I didn&#39;t realize bull alligators helped each other out. I <br/>\ngot trounced<br/>\n&gt; &gt;by two of them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m becoming increasingly convinced that tasks are not soloable. :<br/>\n(<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Chris<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
