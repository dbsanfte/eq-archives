When a mob drops something worth rolling on,<br/>\nthe leader of the group rolls /random 1000.  Say for<br/>\nexample he gets a 678 ... everyone in the group,<br/>\nincluding the leader, then rolls /random 678.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow why we do it this way but we do :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best roll coup I EVER got was for a locustlure in<br/>\nKarnor Castle.  This item is worth about 7kpp on my<br/>\nserver, by far the best loot I&#39;ve ever seen on a mob<br/>\nin my 48 levels.  I was leader of the group, so I<br/>\nrolled /random 1000.  I got a 227.  So everyone rolls<br/>\n/random 227 and guess what I got on that roll ..<br/>\nthat&#39;s right, a 227.  Talk about WOOT!!!  I was so<br/>\nexcited, I&#39;d NEVER won a roll before on ANYTHING. <br/>\nAnyway, I traded it for Coldain Skin Boots (worth<br/>\nabout 12kpp) a few minutes later (didn&#39;t even have to<br/>\nauction the thing), but it was still the most exciting<br/>\nthing that&#39;s ever happened to me in Everquest .. ok<br/>\nthat&#39;s sad ..<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nymue~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nNymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br/>\nWood Elf Druid, Cazic-Thule Server<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
