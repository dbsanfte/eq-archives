I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1809570748\">Taven,<br/>\n    I&#39;m sorry to see you having so many problems.  I am on a 28.8 modem and<br/>\nan AMD 300 machine with RIVA TNT.  The only problem I have is prom my ISP.<br/>\nI have a Live card installed and the initial install was painful to say the<br/>\nleast.  This is what happened to me.  After installing Live I found that the<br/>\nall my DMA channels were taken.  If you have a hard drive that uses DMA then<br/>\nthe Live card may have taken it away.  This caused my system to lockup<br/>\nbecause my hard drive would take all CPU processing whenever it was<br/>\naccessed.  Even for just looking at the drive space would shoot my CPU above<br/>\n100%.  I had to reload my drivers for the hard drive.  You may want to go to<br/>\nyour drives site and get a current version of the driver while you are at<br/>\nit.  Just incase you don&#39;t know how to check to see if DMA is checked on the<br/>\ndrive, go to the control panel select System and then device manager, select<br/>\nyour hard drive and select properties.  The DMA box should be checked.  If<br/>\nthere is know DMA box present(as was my case) make sure you have a DMA<br/>\ndrive.  If you do install a new driver.  If the new driver doesn&#39;t resolve<br/>\nthe problem then use a generic driver.  I have a 2.5 gig Western Digital and<br/>\na 6 gig Maxtor.  They both use a generic driver and I haven&#39;t had any<br/>\nproblems since.<br/>\n    If this isn&#39;t your problem then I guess best of luck.  I hope that this<br/>\nmay help a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nLilu - Monk of Tranquility (Veeshan)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
