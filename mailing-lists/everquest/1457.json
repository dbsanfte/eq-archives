These things happen every day, both in-game and<br/>\n outside. If you are a core roleplayer just think of it as he had a rich<br/>\n uncle. If not well, you would do it yourself if you had a chance. Simply<br/>\n nothing to moan about.<br/>\n <br/>\n Envy wont help you one bit. Most likely hes gone through the &quot;i killed 2000<br/>\n rats and then 2000 orc pawns&quot; with another character and its not appealing<br/>\n to do it again.<br/>\n <br/>\n /Alex &gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
