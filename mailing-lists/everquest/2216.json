I wont say what is best because I guess it<br/>\nmight boil down to two players that play well together and not depend on<br/>\ntheir class too much (par from two straight melee).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite?  Ranger + Enchanter.  Outdoor zones fights go something like<br/>\nthis enchanter tashs with beserker up or whatever dmg absorb spell they have<br/>\nfor that lvl.  As enchanter is casting tash he runs at the mob while the<br/>\nranger starts to cast snare enchanter will get hit and his pet will start to<br/>\nattack.  By this time the ranger should have hit the mob and taken agro from<br/>\nthe pet (The pet agro patch actually helped enchanter pets a ton.  They<br/>\ntaunted like nobody&#39;s business and died fairly quick).  Enchanter fears and<br/>\nuses his mana wisely nuking when it wont hurt down time more than help by  a<br/>\nfaster kill.  Ranger shouldnt cast any spells but snare and save the rest of<br/>\nhis mana for heals depending on what you are fighting a few seconds of non<br/>\nfeared mob might take a bub or two.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUsing this tactic an Enchanter Ranger combo can make a great team for<br/>\noutdoor mobs.  Yes, you can substitue the ranger class for any class that<br/>\ncan snare but there are a few reasons, in my opinion, why rangers make the<br/>\nbest choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nNecro, he doesnt need an enchanter, he will get faster exp solo, and the<br/>\nonly thing the enchanter will bring to the group is haste (necro has this<br/>\nfor thier pet, enchanters haste is better at some lvl&#39;s but really not a<br/>\ngood enough reason to group with you).  Clarity?  Necro lich type spells are<br/>\nbetter at every lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\nShadow Knight, his darkness spell doesnt seem to last very long and unless<br/>\nhe has some really good weapons isnt going to do as much dmg as a ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruid, too mana dependant over a period of time the ranger will be able to<br/>\ndo better for you as the druid will start to go oom with constant fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard, maybe a nice second choice never duo&#39;d with one much.  Maybe first,<br/>\nnever tried it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also done this with a warrior that has a snare whip but can make for<br/>\na nasty fight while waiting on whip to proc.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust me rambling at work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Gaudry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bgrifter@...\">bgrifter@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 18, 2002 8:41 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Subject: Best soloing class<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am just wondering your thoughts on which class<br/>\n&gt; makes for the best soloing.. all the way from 1-60..<br/>\n&gt; -emily<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This question comes up way way too often, i&#39;ve seen it<br/>\nargued about 20 seperate times on message boards,<br/>\nhere&#39;s how it usually plays out. The Necros and Druids<br/>\nimmediately leap up and shout &quot;We&#39;re best!&quot; and<br/>\nfrankly, they are. Necros and Druids solo better than<br/>\nany other class in EQ. Which is better? It&#39;s largely a<br/>\nmatter of personal preferance and where you&#39;re<br/>\nsoloing. Then everyone else crowds in on the thread<br/>\narguing the merits of their pet class. (as in<br/>\n&quot;favorite class&quot;, not Mages ;) Technically really any<br/>\nclass can solo, it just involves unmanagable amounts<br/>\nof downtime, picking less than profitable mobs, and<br/>\nunacceptable amounts of risk... unless you&#39;re a Druid<br/>\nor Necro. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an afterthought, had to reply to the post<br/>\nquestioning Mage&#39;s dominance as &quot;the pet class&quot;, take<br/>\na look at the message boards on eqvault.ign.com<br/>\nthere&#39;s a large thread comparing the Mage Epic pet to<br/>\nthe highest level Beastlord pet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nWeb-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
