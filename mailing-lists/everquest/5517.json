Keep trying, be patient.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want a black racial character you need to play<br/>\nan erudite.  You just can&#39;t be an Erudite Monk...<br/>\nheheh<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Robert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rengar65@...\">Rengar65@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok, I&#39;m new to this group and to playing EQ.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My questions may be redundant to those asked by<br/>\n&gt; others here or even <br/>\n&gt; off the wall but her goes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does any one use begging?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have built mine to 23 (not real hi I know but the<br/>\n&gt; character is only <br/>\n&gt; 9th level) so far all it has done is get me 2 copper<br/>\n&gt; and attacked <br/>\n&gt; twice.  Not good odds (one attack per copper).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why do I have direction sense?  And why would you<br/>\n&gt; buy a compass?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a compass on my screen.  I already know what<br/>\n&gt; direction I am <br/>\n&gt; facing.  My direction sense is at 200 and it still<br/>\n&gt; only works about <br/>\n&gt; 60% of the time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a monk, how do I improve my safe fall skill<br/>\n&gt; without spending all <br/>\n&gt; my points on it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I keep jumping off tall things and taking damage but<br/>\n&gt; no improvement.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why are all the characters white?
