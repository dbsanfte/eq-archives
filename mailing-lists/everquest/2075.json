The lowest<br/>\nend are the brown and tan rope bridles. The highest end I saw were the black<br/>\nand white chain bridles. The chain ones went for about 117,000pp (to my wood<br/>\nelf druid). The silk bridles ran about 78,000pp. I want to take my bard with<br/>\nher charisma gear. The tan and brown silk ones were around 75,000. So i<br/>\nguess they figured the black ones and white ones were more sought after. I<br/>\njust wish they had other colors. I think it would be cool to have a pinto.<br/>\nOr a red horse like the one my sister has in rl. Or a gray one like the<br/>\nhorse I got for my b-day one year.<br/>\ntoo bad it would be too complicated to give the horses personalities.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
