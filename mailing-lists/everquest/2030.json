Look at Sims. They make expansion packs but they<br/>\ndon&#39;t require you to change your system everytime a new expansion comes out.<br/>\nConsidering how addictive EQ is, even without the new graphics engines<br/>\npeople would still be playing. They could still add to the game by making<br/>\nnew zones and such without requiring a change in directx programs. They<br/>\ncould find other ways to make the game better without changing the system<br/>\nrequirements so drastically. What if they expanded the game one day and<br/>\nchanged the system requirements to the point that you could not afford to<br/>\nupgrade? What then? Would you be a happy camper? While verant may be getting<br/>\na few more customers who can handle the higher end requirements, they are<br/>\nalienating older customers with lower end systems. In the long run, that<br/>\nkind of attitude toward customers is bad for business. If Verant doesn&#39;t<br/>\ngive a fuck about their current customers then they will start to lose<br/>\nbusiness. If I were the VP I would find some way so that there would be some<br/>\nservers set aside so that the lower end systems could still play on them--<br/>\nwhich is what the GMs have been suggesting. And I certainly wouldn&#39;t release<br/>\na game full of bugs before it had been fully tested. I would also have<br/>\nresearch done and surveys to find out just how many people would no longer<br/>\nbe able to play with their current systems and factor that into my decision<br/>\non what types of changes could be made without alienating a large customer<br/>\nbase. Change is important in some regard, but so is reliability and<br/>\nintegrity. So far, Verant seems to be lacking the latter two. -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a paying customer, I do not want EQ to just survive.

People will and do quit after <br/>\n&gt; doing everything there is to do in EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is crazy for people to think that a company should hold back and <br/>\n&gt; try<br/>\n </span></blockquote>not<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to be the best game out on the market.
