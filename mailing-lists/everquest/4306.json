Your characters and their info are <br/>\nkept indefinitely in their servers unless they go cleaning it out for <br/>\nspace which I highly doubt since your files are miniscule in size. <br/>\nI&#39;ve had a number of friend who have left for over a year (one for 3) <br/>\nand have returned with everything intact. The only catch is it make <br/>\ntake some time to re-activate your account after extremely prolonged <br/>\ninactivity. :) So there is no way you can leave for a year, then come <br/>\nback and not get your account back. Of course if you were banned or <br/>\nsuspended, then that is another issue, or your credit card is maxed <br/>\nheh. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Melanie Johnson &lt;melanie_6602@y...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not really trying to argue here  but I have canceled my account 3 <br/>\n </span></blockquote>different times for RL things.
