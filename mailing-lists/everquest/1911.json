No buffs.<br/>\nHighhold Pass was like a giant puzzle.  Great fun. I have done it many <br/>\ntimes since, but the first time was the most fun. Things killed me in <br/>\nKithicor that I had never seen before.

He he, after how far i&#39;d come it would have been very annoying to <br/>\n&gt;get killed there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  btw - Ralwen made it to Kelethin so say hi if you&#39;re in the <br/>\n&gt; neighbourhood - most peopole there don&#39;t believe that a lv6 could foot it <br/>\n&gt; alone from Qeynos, even with the assist through highpass, tho to be <br/>\n&gt; honest, with Selo&#39;s most of the zones were easy, especially once i got to <br/>\n&gt; the Commons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheers<br/>\n&gt;Ralwen<br/>\n&gt;Bard of the 6th verse<br/>\n&gt;Torvonnilous<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hmmm, I tend to be very cautious because I hate CRs so I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;know....  Maybe the stupidest thing I do often is running through Kithicor <br/>\n&gt;at any time of the night.  I just get a sow and run up on the side of the <br/>\n&gt;hill as fast as I can and never look back.  So far, I&#39;ve been lucky and <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been doing this since my mid teen levels.
