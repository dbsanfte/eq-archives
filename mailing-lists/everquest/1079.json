Mine is only <br/>\n&gt; a level 6 halfling warrior, but I have invested quite a bit of time <br/>\n&gt; in just getting this far. I know I can build another character a bit <br/>\n&gt; faster based on what I have learned, but is that investment of time <br/>\n&gt; worthwhile?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do have a second character just started, but that was only <br/>\n&gt; something to play when the area my halfling was camped in was shut <br/>\n&gt; down for repairs. I am thinking more on building a second character <br/>\n&gt; for tactical purposes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example, I wandered out of Rivervale to High Hold Pass one day, <br/>\n&gt; and was slaughtered by Orcs. I managed to sneak back to recover my <br/>\n&gt; stuff, but could not get out fast enough. I gave up that corpse, and <br/>\n&gt; concentrated on building in Misty Thicket.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My thought is to build a character over time just to get through High <br/>\n&gt; Pass Hold. My greater interest is in the warrior working his way <br/>\n&gt; across Misty Thicket. Am I wasting valuable game time on this second <br/>\n&gt; character? High Pass Hold seems extremely difficult, and might not be <br/>\n&gt; worth the effort until much later in the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Samwiseguy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
