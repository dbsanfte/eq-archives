It&#39;s defintiely \nworth it to play various chars, esp low levels in different areas. It keeps you \nfrom being &quot;burned out&quot;. I&#39;ve got 6 chars on Nameless under 10 in commons and \ngfay area and if I played one steady I woudl go insane from boredom!

Mine is only \n  <br>&gt; a level 6 halfling warrior, but I have invested quite a bit of time \n  <br>&gt; in just getting this far. I know I can build another character a bit \n  <br>&gt; faster based on what I have learned, but is that investment of time \n  <br>&gt; worthwhile?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I do have a second character just \n  started, but that was only <br>&gt; something to play when the area my \n  halfling was camped in was shut <br>&gt; down for repairs. I am thinking more \n  on building a second character <br>&gt; for tactical purposes.<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; For example, I wandered out of Rivervale to High Hold Pass one day, \n  <br>&gt; and was slaughtered by Orcs. I managed to sneak back to recover my \n  <br>&gt; stuff, but could not get out fast enough. I gave up that corpse, and \n  <br>&gt; concentrated on building in Misty Thicket.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; My \n  thought is to build a character over time just to get through High <br>&gt; \n  Pass Hold. My greater interest is in the warrior working his way <br>&gt; \n  across Misty Thicket. Am I wasting valuable game time on this second <br>&gt; \n  character? High Pass Hold seems extremely difficult, and might not be <br>&gt; \n  worth the effort until much later in the game.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Any \n  thoughts?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Samwiseguy<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
