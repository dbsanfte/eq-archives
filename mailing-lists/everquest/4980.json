Attacking a mezzed, snared, or rooted mob that you did not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1426423784\">Well, according to the official rules it&#39;s only KSing if the other person<br/>\nengaged the mob first. Attacking a mezzed, snared, or rooted mob that you<br/>\ndid not engage first is KSing (if you get the kill). Sometimes it gets into<br/>\ngray areas. For instance if a mob comes and attacks you after someone else<br/>\naggrod it and the people who were originally attacking it don&#39;t come to get<br/>\nit or help you and you have to kill it to defend yourself then it&#39;s not<br/>\nKSing as the mob is considered abandoned.<br/>\nSome people still do camp checks. If you camp a spot for a long time people<br/>\ncan still come in and kill a mob that you are waiting for and the GMs can&#39;t<br/>\ndo anything about it bc it&#39;s not against the rules. The reason for these<br/>\nrules is bc it&#39;s too difficult to figure out who was camping a spot first.<br/>\nThe only time I have moved in on a camp that someone else was at was when a<br/>\nlvl 65 was claiming the entire undead section of lower guk and I wanted to<br/>\nhunt there for xp. My group moved into one room and the jerk tried to pull<br/>\nmobs that we were already fighting. (he started pulling the entire dungeon<br/>\nover other people and then killing them).<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re right about KS&#39;ing, I may add if someone looks like they<br/>\nare waiting for a spawn, and you find out they are, taking it would be a<br/>\nKS IMHO.  I haven&#39;t played in a while, do people still do camp checks<br/>\nwhen they enter a zone?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: STG2 Pierce [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:piercer@...\">piercer@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 21, 2003 3:00 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EverQuest] Re: Has this ever happened to you?? and<br/>\nwhat can you do when it does<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don&#39;t think you did anything wrong..you basically<br/>\npulled for camp 1 even though you did not mean to and all the group did<br/>\nwas let you get pounded so you ran off to save your life which is what I<br/>\nwould of done in that situation.  That group might of all been afk<br/>\n(doubt it) and when they got back on they thought that you trained them<br/>\non purpose...but anyway if all their gonna do in the game is cause you<br/>\nproblems then they are all immature and don&#39;t have much of a life.  If<br/>\nit happens again you should take a screen shot of what they said and<br/>\ntell a gm about it..if he asks for the proof then you have it all right<br/>\nthere...it&#39;ll take like a week to get a response back but thats the only<br/>\nsure way to take care of this problem...that or either ignore them.<br/>\nThis kind of thing happened to me in Echo Caverns..I was wondering<br/>\naround looking for a spot to solo when this needlite comes out and<br/>\nattacks me from behind.  I see a group of 3 people nearby in the<br/>\nneedlite camp and I tell them I have a mob for you guys but all they did<br/>\nwas sit there.they had no mobs in their area.  I tell them again but I<br/>\nstill get no response.  By this time I lost about 2 bubs of health so I<br/>\nsaid screw it and killed it off.  Later I get a shout telling everyone<br/>\nin the zone I am a KSer..now let me get this right isn&#39;t KSing killing a<br/>\nmob that someone else is already fighting?
