Well, I can definitely help your hubby get to your <br/>\nlevel if you&#39;re on Vazaelle.  I doubt it though.  Not many poeple <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen online post that they&#39;re on vazaelle.  Cuz I can definitely <br/>\nhelp him level.  I&#39;m a level 51 druid and I can use my 49 DS and <br/>\nhe&#39;ll kill mobs like they were nothing.  It deals 24 points of damage <br/>\neach time the mob hits the person with the DS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Laura Buskirk&quot; &lt;wolffe@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if some of you could help me.  I got my hubby <br/>\ninvolved in EQ<br/>\n&gt; so he&#39;d stop bugging me to get off the computer.  He&#39;s got a 10th <br/>\nlvl<br/>\n&gt; halfling fighter, and I know next to nothing about the melee <br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n&gt; Assuming he&#39;s got about 1000pp to spend, what are his best choices <br/>\nfor armor<br/>\n&gt; and a decent weapon.  He&#39;s got a fine steel longsword right now, <br/>\nwhich seems<br/>\n&gt; to suck, and leather armor.  Should he go to bronze or fine steel <br/>\narmor?<br/>\n&gt; What does a full suit of either of these cost?  And what&#39;s the best <br/>\nweapon<br/>\n&gt; for him at this point?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, I&#39;m trying to powerlevel him just a little so we can go <br/>\nadventuring<br/>\n&gt; together, though I&#39;m not generally a fan of leveling people that <br/>\ndon&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; what they&#39;re doing.  They should die plenty and learn like the rest <br/>\nof us<br/>\n&gt; did :P  I have a 16 druid and he just needs a couple of levels so <br/>\nwe can<br/>\n&gt; hang out.  Is there a good place to do this quickly?  All I can <br/>\nthink of at<br/>\n&gt; the moment is to fear kite lions and bears, oh my, and let him hack <br/>\nthem up.<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s so darn many people in EC these days, though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any help!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Laura </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
