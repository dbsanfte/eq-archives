I was in GFay<br/>\nwith my halfling druid memming spells when suddenly<br/>\nthere was a zone wide message of &quot;You hear faeries<br/>\ngiggling&quot;, then a handful of faeries started to talk<br/>\nabout wanting to play hide and go seek. After doing a<br/>\nquick &quot;/who&quot; on one and getting &quot;there are no players<br/>\nin this zone under this name&quot; I lept up and started<br/>\nrunning madly around Kelethin trying to find them. A<br/>\nfew other players caught on rather quickly and started<br/>\na zone wide game of hide and seek. :) I found a couple<br/>\nof them on the ground after a while and since I was<br/>\nplaying a halfling didn&#39;t mind getting into the whole<br/>\nthing. (&quot;hee hee! I&#39;ve found you, now it&#39;s off to find<br/>\nthe others!&quot; ;) Eventually things culminated just<br/>\noutside of Felwithe where about 25 or so players<br/>\ngathered around the faeries. Unfortunately a couple of<br/>\nblithering morons decided it was a good idea to attack<br/>\nand managed to deal on average 2-3 points of dmg (one<br/>\nper swing, zero per spell) and get laughed at. The<br/>\nfaeries handed out gifts to a couple of people, one<br/>\ngot a Mithiril Breastplate, don&#39;t know about anything<br/>\nelse. (I didn&#39;t get anything) Then the faeries blinded<br/>\nus all a few times, gave everyone levitate, and left<br/>\nciting the &quot;meanies who tried to hurt us&quot; as their<br/>\nreason. It was pretty cool for my first GM event, and<br/>\nif nothing else, levitate is a ton of fun, all the<br/>\nnewbies were having a blast with it. :) (I still think<br/>\nthe most frightening thing an Orc will ever see is a<br/>\nflying halfling coming to cleave them in half ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________ <br/>\nSend your holiday cheer with <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.ca\">http://greetings.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
