The ranger seems much better suited for \nthis, and one of the reasons I wanted to be a ranger is so I could walk into a \nlow level dungeon and camp items. They get snare which is&nbsp;imperative for \nkeeping mobs from running. They can track so outdoors they can find rare mobs \nand indoors they can see if any rare mobs are there.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I guess I am asking for some advice and tips. I \ncamped&nbsp;some items&nbsp;with my enchanter and found it to be rather tedious. \nIt seems like a good starting camp for beginners is the dragoon dirk in \nCrushbone. I&nbsp;once camped that whole area with my level 40 enchanter and \nwith a pet it was actually pretty easy as long as everything is green to you. \n</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I camped some item for a quest in Upper Guk from \nthe froglok&nbsp;scryer and I had to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;killing everything in the \nroom&nbsp;until the Scryer actually spawned and I got the&nbsp;glowing \ngloves&nbsp;for the incandescent gloves quest. </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I guess I should go to Alakhazam and even pay the \nsubscription fee to find out some good stuff to camp/quests to do, etc. \n</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I guess you decide upon a target and then spend a \nridiculous amount of time waiting for it to show up. </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Like a classic target is Grenix Mucktail, who drops \nthe Polished Granite Tomahawk. I suppose in order to camp the PGT you just keep \nkilling all the gnolls in the area that Grenix spawns until he does and then you \nkill him and get the Tomahawk. I don&#39;t think that is very productive for a level \n30 ranger to do, but it would be good practice. I suppose you would make some \nmoney from the items the gnolls dropped as well. Maybe I will camp the orcs on \nthe other side to see if that guy who drops the weight reduction bag shows up. \n</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">It seems like an enchanter is a better character \nfor getting into groups and being invited on epic encounters, but a ranger is \nbetter for doing quests and camping items. \n</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
