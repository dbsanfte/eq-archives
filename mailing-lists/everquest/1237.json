I need to save up my mana. or sorry I&#39;m \n  busy and I need<br>to save up my mana.<br>I generally try to say please when I \n  ask for sows or buffs. I&#39;ve asked for<br>buffs without saying please and then \n  realized I forgot the please and then<br>add that on in another \n  line.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>&gt; I&#39;m sure this thread has been beaten to death \n  here but<br>&gt; I&#39;m going to ask it anyway cuz I&#39;m new to the list \n  :)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I have a 47 druid on Cazic-Thule and, like many of<br>&gt; \n  you, I get *very* tired of being begged for SoW,<br>&gt; ports, HP buffs, etc. \n  Also like many of you, I SoW,<br>&gt; buff, and port newbies and friendly \n  people for free<br>&gt; whenever I can. I hand out nice weapons and \n  decent<br>&gt; armor to newbies like they&#39;re candy, and I genuinely<br>&gt; \n  enjoy helping people (That&#39;s a big reason I chose a<br>&gt; druid as my \n  main).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; However, like almost all druids, I have times \n  when<br>&gt; newbies and/or experienced players come up to me and<br>&gt; ask \n  for things without saying please or when I&#39;m very<br>&gt; busy (like for \n  instance the cleric just left the<br>&gt; group, we haven&#39;t found another \n  healer, my heals blow,<br>&gt; but I am the primary healer until another is \n  located).<br>&gt; I have a standard hotkey set up for those who ask \n  for<br>&gt; SoW or whatever rudely (the &quot;Can I get a SoW&quot; irks me<br>&gt; no \n  end):<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Beggar: Can I get a SoW?<br>&gt; Nymue: I&#39;m sorry, I do \n  not comply with rude requests.<br>&gt; Nymue: Have a nice day!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  This does not work. They hang around begging, saying<br>&gt; please, and so on \n  and so forth. One guy told me today,<br>&gt; &quot;Damn druids ruin the game.&quot; \n  Lovely.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So my poll today is to collect people&#39;s favorite \n  ways<br>&gt; of denying requests when they don&#39;t want to/don&#39;t have<br>&gt; \n  the time/are in a group/don&#39;t feel like complying. If<br>&gt; anyone has an \n  amusing, polite, or snotty reply to<br>&gt; share with me I&#39;d love to hear it \n  - I&#39;m going to set<br>&gt; my favorites up as hotkeys, so please don&#39;t share \n  it<br>&gt; unless you don&#39;t mind me copying it :)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Many thanks \n  in advance for everyone&#39;s assistance,<br>&gt; Nymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br>&gt; Lvl 47 \n  Wood Elf Druid<br>&gt; Cazic-Thule Server<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  =====<br>&gt; Nymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br>&gt; Wood Elf Druid, Cazic-Thule \n  Server<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  __________________________________________________<br>&gt; Do You \n  Yahoo!?<br>&gt; Yahoo!
