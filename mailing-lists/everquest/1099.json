One tick is 6 seconds. Bard songs<br/>\nare either instants or 3 ticks long. If you manage to time it perfectly<br/>\nwith<br/>\nthe ticks on the server you can hold 4 songs up without any misses. This<br/>\nrequire a lot of training and a very good connection AND a very good sense<br/>\nof timing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree songs is the norm and all bards worth the name should be able to<br/>\nhandle this with an ok con if you put your mind to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe macro that was described works ok in non-combat situations. In combat<br/>\nits a lot better to just twist manually. If you get a missed note in the<br/>\nbeginning of the macro you cant start any songs at all until the macro<br/>\nfinishes which is not acceptable in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read some of the articles written by Thott (guildleader of Afterlife<br/>\non Mithaniel Marr) he does a good job in describing timings and mechanics<br/>\nof<br/>\na bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people claim to be able to do 5 songs but to my knowledge this is not<br/>\npossible without &quot;faking it&quot; with for example Breath of Harmony that procs<br/>\n&quot;NivÂ´s melody of preservation&quot;. Thus you can hold 5 effects in the air and<br/>\nREALLY impress people around you. just hotkey 4 songs and hit them in order<br/>\nand keep it timed. Thats the life of a bard. Also Instruments boost the<br/>\neffect of many songs VERY much. Many times its worth NOT meleeing and just<br/>\ntwist songs and sometimes instruments too. Always remember - youre not a<br/>\ntank. After playing bard over two years now i can say the best thing about<br/>\nbards is that they are good at minimizing downtime. And boy downtime sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo time the ticks are used by other classes aswell but not as much as the<br/>\nbards. But some casters use tick-med as a technique.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Ranina Fyrecurls of Ayonae Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: IT3 Adam J.

So, starting and stopping and restarting songs fast<br/>\n&gt; enough will allow you to have multiple song effects active all at the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>same<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; time.  I think 3 songs at a time is what most people try to manage.  The<br/>\n&gt; best method I&#39;ve seen to do this is by programming a hotkey that would<br/>\n&gt; look something like this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; /pause 30;/sing 1<br/>\n&gt; /pause 30;/sing 2<br/>\n&gt; /pause 30;/sing 3<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When you hit this hotkey, it would start song in spell slot 1, wait 3<br/>\n&gt; seconds, start song in spell slot 2, wait 3 seconds, then start song in<br/>\n&gt; spell slot 3.  When you notice the effects of song 1 fading, you hit the<br/>\n&gt; hot key again and it starts over.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a lvl 5 bard char which I have only played a little.  If anyone<br/>\n&gt; knows of better ways to twist songs I would like to hear them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -mac<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
