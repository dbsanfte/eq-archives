I <br/>\nam a graduate student at the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute of <br/>\nTechnology in Chicago. For one of my classes, entitled Observing Users, we <br/>\nhave to study a product and its users. Our group chose Everquest because we <br/>\nthink that it is very interesting and complex. As a retired online gamer I know <br/>\nhow much fun and involving the games can be. In fact, I am very tempted to <br/>\njump into Everquest, but I am worried that I may lose concentration on my <br/>\nstudies. If anyone is willing to devote a little of their time to helping us out we <br/>\nwould really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are poor grad students and will <br/>\nnot be able to compensate anyone who helps us out, but we will very very <br/>\nthankful. Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew Haywood</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
