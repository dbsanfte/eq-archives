I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1626639831\">Before LoY, certain kinds of armor were dyable. Off<br/>\nthe top of my head, the only ones I can think of were<br/>\nfine plate (which not many people wear anymore). I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know exactly how the dyes were made, but I&#39;m<br/>\npretty sure brewing was a part of it,and the<br/>\ncomponants were dropped from mobs, for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith LoY, all armor can be dyed. I&#39;ve only done a<br/>\nlittle dying, but if I remember right, it requires<br/>\npottery and brewing, neither of which has to be *too*<br/>\nhigh, but maybe at least around a skill of 100. The<br/>\ndye is called Prismatic Dye, and you can usually find<br/>\nsomeone selling it in the bazaar.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have the dye, all you do it open your<br/>\ninventory, and at the bottom there is a &quot;dye&quot; button.<br/>\nJust click on that, then pick the piece you want to<br/>\ndye, and it does it for you automatically, as long as<br/>\nthe vial of dye is in your inventory.<br/>\n<br/>\n(and if I had bothered to read all this thread, I<br/>\nwould have seen that some of this info was already<br/>\ngiven to you.
