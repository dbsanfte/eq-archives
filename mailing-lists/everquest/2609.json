An enchanter is not a good choice for a first character, \nalthough it did make me a much better player in the long run. That was before \nbreeze came out too, so it was ultra hard. I have had my current character for \nquite some time. I kind of twinked him with some basic stuff like banded armor \nand a mino axe but nothing extravagant. I got him from level 23 to 30 in about a \nweek though when I started playing him again. Of course, Xegony was one of the \nfirst servers and everyone is totally twinked and power-leveled on that server. \nThere are some aspects of the game I know a lot about, like the classes and \ntheir roles in a group. I know a lot about the enchanter and wizard classes as I \nhave a level 40 enchanter and wizard. That is good that you are trying out \ndifferent classes but eventually you will have to figure out which one to \nconcentrate on. What classes are you playing?</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"rlebeau65@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">MiniGamer</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Thursday, April 04, 2002 8:37 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Hi, I am \n  new</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>If you have played for a week and have a level \n  30+<br>character, you are better than anyone on this list.<br><br>I have 4 \n  chars, been playing 4 months and they are at<br>16, 14 10, and 10.<br><br>I \n  don&#39;t power level nor do I twink.&nbsp; I actually enjoy<br>the lower levels I \n  just wish I could get good items at<br>those levels.&nbsp; I can&#39;t seem to \n  find good armor or<br>weapons.<br><br>Good Luck but I don&#39;t think you need \n  it.....&nbsp; ;)<br><br><br><br>--- Su &lt;suceress@...&gt; \n  wrote:<br>&gt; Welcome back to EQ!<br>&gt; I&#39;ve been playing EQ since \n  September of 2000 or so.<br>&gt; I obviously enjoy<br>&gt; playing. :-) I&#39;m \n  not sure exactly what kind of<br>&gt; advice you&#39;re asking for<br>&gt; here. \n  Anything specific you need to know about?<br>&gt; luv,<br>&gt; -Su<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; Hi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. I<br>&gt; am not a \n  very good EQ<br>&gt; player. I would consider myself ultra competent \n  in<br>&gt; group battles, but in<br>&gt; other aspects of the game I am \n  decidedly mediocre. I<br>&gt; have never gotten a<br>&gt; character past level \n  40. My first character was an<br>&gt; Erudite Enchanter by the<br>&gt; name of \n  Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to<br>&gt; level 40 after two years \n  or<br>&gt; so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which was my<br>&gt; \n  friends character but I<br>&gt; own it. I just started playing again after \n  giving up<br>&gt; on the game and playing<br>&gt; DAOC. Eventually I gave up \n  all MMORPGS deciding they<br>&gt; were a waste of time.<br>&gt; About a week \n  ago, I decided to give EQ another<br>&gt; chance and have decided that<br>&gt; \n  it has improved a great deal. I am now playing a<br>&gt; Human Ranger who is \n  level<br>&gt; 30. I really like the character. His buffs and<br>&gt; damage \n  spells are great. I<br>&gt; guess I could use some help on how to be a good \n  EQ<br>&gt; player. I have been<br>&gt; playing for about two years and I feel \n  like I know<br>&gt; absolutely nothing about<br>&gt; the game. I have never \n  belonged to a good guild or<br>&gt; anything. I play on the<br>&gt; Xegony \n  server.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  <br><br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do You \n  Yahoo!?<br>Yahoo!
