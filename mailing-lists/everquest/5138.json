You have to kill x number of mobs. Usually we churn through them<br/>\npretty fast. It&#39;s pretty fun.<br/>\nYou generally need someone for crowd control. I was grouped with an<br/>\nexcellent bard who handled crowd control, haste, cure disease/poison, mana<br/>\nregen, tracking,  and being main looter. We finished with about 20 minutes<br/>\nto spare and went on to kill the named. Got 22 points for that one<br/>\nadventure.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The suggestion worked well.  I was playing my 29 alt<br/>\n&gt; barbarian warrior and was the lowest of the party (35<br/>\n&gt; Human Ranger, 34 Dwarf Paladin, 33 Froglok Cleric, 35<br/>\n&gt; Woodelf Druid, 32 Iskar Monk).  I got the mission and<br/>\n&gt; we churned thru it, got to the target and killed him<br/>\n&gt; with very few problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Estro Runeweaver<br/>\n&gt; 46 Halfling Druid<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oltheros Baneslayer<br/>\n&gt; 29 Barbarian Warrior<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; The New Yahoo!
