If you ask for a group in a zone, go ahead and say Enchanter seeking group to hunt with and cast clarity on.

How<br/>\n  often do people ask you for clarity? and how hard would it be to get a group<br/>\n  after achieving 29? and last.... do you recommend going /anon or /role?<br/>\n  Thanks in advance...<br/>\n<br/>\n  --<br/>\n  Fabno Licious, 28th Erudite Enchanter, EMarr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
