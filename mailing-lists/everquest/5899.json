There is no<br/>\nreal wrong way  in regards to your choice of melee.  Do what you feel<br/>\ncomfortable doing and go with it. but at least keep up yer skills in those<br/>\narea&#39;s that you don&#39;t use much just  as a fall back type situation or if you<br/>\nhappen to come across a weapon with some really neat stats that you decide<br/>\nyou want to make use of  later on<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHalyburton MacCulloch<br/>\n67 Barb Shammy<br/>\nLegion of Vengeance<br/>\nSaryrn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Fire on High&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scendera@...\">scendera@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 06, 2004 1:30 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] 1HS vs 2HS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Learn them both, of course...always master every weapon skill open to you.<br/>\n&gt; 2hs is bigger hits but usually less aggro, useful for when you&#39;re not the<br/>\n&gt; MT<br/>\n&gt; of a group or raid but want to get your licks in anyway. 1hs is faster,<br/>\n&gt; typically more aggro, and allows you to use a shield for bash.<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Greg &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freechylde@...\">freechylde@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, November 05, 2004 7:36 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] 1HS vs 2HS<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Greetings....<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have been playing EQ for a long time, played nearly every class<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with most races. I feel I am knowledgeable about many things in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; regards to each class, race, etc. Yet, there is the one question<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that evades me.. For the &quot;Knight&quot; classes, (Shadowknights and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Paladins), what is better..the traditional 1hs or the 2hs. I have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; seen people, including my friends who do 2hs, and some that do 1hs.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; What are the pros and cons of each...so I can decide which way to go<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with my new pally...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; thanks </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
