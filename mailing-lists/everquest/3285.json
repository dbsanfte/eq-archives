I do agree very much that you shall keep your account safe and all<br/>\nthis, but in a large scale operations guild its IMPOSSIBLE to not share your<br/>\naccount with a few people that you trust. This is essential to day to day<br/>\noperations. You choose a couple of people who you trust and hand them your<br/>\ninfo.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 example. Guild property and funding. A single person cannot manage the<br/>\ntrades/funds/hand out of items for the guild. This would be a full time job<br/>\nfor 1 person in my guild. Our solution is a separate account shared among<br/>\nthe officers with mules for cash / gems / spells / items. On our<br/>\nmessageboard transactions take place and a member can ask any officer to<br/>\ncomplete a transaction once its validated on board. This is clearly against<br/>\nthe EULA but since there are no support for these types of operations with a<br/>\ncentral store for a guild we have not found a better way to handle work like<br/>\nthis. How do others solve these types of problems?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, July 19, 2002 5:32 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Digest Number 531<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, any exchange of accounts is forbidden by the terms of service. Part of<br/>\nthe reason for this is that the person buying the account may get swindled.<br/>\nThey may pay for the account only to find that the character is deleted or<br/>\nthe person changes passwords on them and so forth. I&#39;ve heard of this<br/>\nhappening. Or they may get an account that has many soulmarks for bad<br/>\nbehavior. Also, people who work for Verant and EQ have been invited to this<br/>\nlist. If they see the people advertising they are selling their accounts<br/>\nhere, they may bust the person who is trying to sell it.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since he is selling his account for Platnum (15k, which I don&#39;t have) is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that against the rules?
