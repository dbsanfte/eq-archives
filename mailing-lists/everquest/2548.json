I don&#39;t<br/>\ndo it for money, I like to be nice and joke with people. The other day some<br/>\nguy gave me 100pp just for emoting something.<br/>\nAnd high lvl druids have been nice to my druid. One walked up and gave her a<br/>\nbunch of armor, a Forest Loop, and a wraithbone hammer!<br/>\nVery sweet of him.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Well, a FS Scimitar or War Hammer are good choices when you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; starting out.  There just aren&#39;t a lot of places to get it the GF<br/>\n&gt; area.  Another option are the Frozen or Velium weapons coming out of<br/>\n&gt; Velious.  I&#39;ve seen them for as little as 10 PP, and sometimes people<br/>\n&gt; just give them away!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any Avatar I&#39;ve started in GF or BB has always done the CB belt quest<br/>\n&gt; as many times as possible.  You have to load up and go see the<br/>\n&gt; Dwarves, then sell any armor and weapons you don&#39;t want.  Also,<br/>\n&gt; people do buy them, and if you can sneak into Crushbone you can clean<br/>\n&gt; up.  Some people can&#39;t be bothered with them and will just leave them<br/>\n&gt; around.  Make sure to ask unless there&#39;s nobody nearby.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And, since I assume you are one of those cute little Wood Elf Druids<br/>\n&gt; just flirt a little and all those big Warriors will fall all over<br/>\n&gt; themselves to help you out! I know I would!
