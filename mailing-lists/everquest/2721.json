The Geforce 3 and 4 Ti series do. I \nnoticed a definate difference between the appearance of my enchanter friend&#39;s \nair elemental illusion with the Geforce 4 Ti and the Geforce 4 MX. With the Ti \nhe looked incredible, with the MX he looked mediocre at best. It is such a major \ndifference that I cannot play the game anymore without a Geforce 4 Ti. I&nbsp;am \nso distraught that I have to go to bed now so I can take this crap card back to \nthe store and get a real graphics card. &nbsp;</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"biltilie@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:biltilie@...\">Biltilie \n  Dwimmerlaik</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Tuesday, April 16, 2002 11:25 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Geforce 4 MX vs \n  Geforce 4 Ti</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>J.
