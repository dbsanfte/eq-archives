If you didn&#39;t think your gear did a huge impact \nit&#39;s time to think again and start checking how to exp while gaining as good \ngear as possible during your lower levels. Check safehouse as someone else \nmentioned, that forum has all the info you need (don&#39;t forget the search \nfunction, people can get somewhat irritated on new people asking questions that \nhas been asked 100 times in the past few days =P).</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-467700298312201707-20032003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-467700298312201707-20032003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\">-domi</font></span></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote>\n  <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-467700298OutlookMessageHeader\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"\n size=\"2\">-----Original Message-----<br><b>From:</b> Wulfric Rennison \n  [mailto:wulftech@...]<br><b>Sent:</b> den 19 mars 2003 \n  23:30<br><b>To:</b> EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] \n  Playing a rogue<br><br></font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Perhaps you people can help me.&nbsp; This is \n  something I&#39;ve pondered for awhile.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">My rogue is level 32.&nbsp; I play him \n  infrequently.&nbsp; At level 30 rogues get all the skills they are going to \n  get.&nbsp; Rogues are non-casters so they don&#39;t have new spells to look \n  forward to.&nbsp; The only things rogues have to look forward to are their \n  disciplines at level 50.&nbsp; So how does one get from level 30 to level 50 \n  in the shortest amount of time possible?&nbsp; Whenever I play, it seems like \n  I always have a hard time finding a group.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking in places like \n  Frontier Mountains, The Overthere, and Dawnshroud Peaks.&nbsp; I&#39;m not high \n  enough level that I can easily solo any mobs in either of those zones.
