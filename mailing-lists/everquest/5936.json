So keep \n  that in mind when building your system, you might need a larger power supply \n  or else the system shuts itself off and has other problems. My father found \n  this out the hard way when he ordered a new PC from HP. They put in the \n  GeForce 5 but did not increase the power supply so he had to go buy a new \n  power supply in order for his computer to work.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>======== \n  At 2004-11-19, 11:15:00 you wrote: ========<br><br>My system specs are a \n  Pentium 4 1.8Ghz and a 400mhz FSB&nbsp; with 1024MB of RAM and a 128MB ATI \n  Radeon 9200 video card.&nbsp; It seemed to run the beta version of EQ2 quite \n  well with minimal lag in most cases, so if you&#39;re system is commensurate to \n  that, you shouldn&#39;t have a problem.&nbsp; <br><br>I am, however, building a \n  new system that will be a Pentium 4 2.4Ghz and a 533mhz FSB with 1024MB of RAM \n  and a 256MB ATI Radeon 9600XT video card.&nbsp; I expect good things from it \n  when I&#39;m done.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think EQ2 should run quite nicely on \n  it.<br><br>Wulfric<br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest \n  homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
