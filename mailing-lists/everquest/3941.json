I got into it also, I&#39;m really <br/>\nexcited! <br/>\n<br/>\nWell I don&#39;t know about it being a &quot;kid&#39;s platform&quot; I&#39;m 33 and think <br/>\nit will do great on the PS2. The only thing I think there might be <br/>\nissues with regarding it&#39;s survival is the whol PS2 online part. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if there will be too many people that will get the adapter <br/>\nor allow their kids to go online with it. Didn&#39;t Nintendo or another <br/>\ngaming console maker try that a few years back but it failed? <br/>\nPersonally there were times I wish I had EQ for my PS2 simply to free <br/>\nup my PC for other things. Like I can play EQ all day and the wife <br/>\nwon&#39;t have to yell at me to get off the PC so she can use it! LOL <br/>\n<br/>\nYou said a regular USB keyboard will work on the PS2? Thats cool, I <br/>\nhave one so now I won&#39;t have to go buy the PS2 specific one. You know <br/>\nwhat would be great, if you could use those little USB storage <br/>\ndevices to save info on! God that would rock! <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW since your also in the Beta, you can PM me anytime and we can <br/>\nchat about the game. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
