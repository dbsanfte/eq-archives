I hardly ever get to loot bc<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my connection speed. People always beat me to the corpses. So I&#39;m lucky<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make 10p in several hours of camping. I think I made about 50p camping<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SolA for 26 hours. I&#39;m generally busy healing or medding so the tanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; usually get the loot anyways. Plus I&#39;m not that aggressive about loot.<br/>\n&gt; there are tradeskills as well: i sold heady kiolas to get the money for<br/>\n&gt; the two horses i have. i takes some time to make them and it also<br/>\n&gt; may take some days to sell them (on vendor in bazaar), but it is sort<br/>\n&gt; of easy money. the only drawback: you hate doing it! hint: never start<br/>\n&gt; to count the clicks you have to do!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI suck at selling and can&#39;t go into the bazaar anymore. Sharing a network<br/>\nwith 4 computers with only a 19.2kbps connection really really blows. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t even play EQ if one person has a text based rpg going on online now.<br/>\n:-(<br/>\nWhich means I haven&#39;t been able to play for quite awhile...<br/>\nI&#39;m still using heady kiolas to try to get tailoring up to move on to do the<br/>\n6th shawl. I have everything I need to make it except the skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i fill my trader with two or three bags full of heady kiola. it takes<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; 45 minutes to fill one bag, that&#39;s 10 stacks, eg 200 per bag. on tarew<br/>\n&gt; you can set prices to 3pp to 5pp per piece. i have seen people buying<br/>\n&gt; them off me instead from cheaper vendors, because i had many stacks,<br/>\n&gt; and not &quot;only&quot; less then 20 on me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nMan I wish I could use the bazaar....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; another item are some furs/pelts used for tradeskills or quests, for<br/>\nexample<br/>\n&gt;  in WW wolves drop a pelt, that is sold for 400pp to 600pp each. well,<br/>\n&gt; some still ask for 1000pp for it (i believe it is used for blacksmithing).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nWow. WW is what now? warsilk woods? What lvl are they?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; tradeskills got really complex! allakhazam has a nice feature showing<br/>\n&gt; the full &quot;chain&quot; of items needed. for example have a look at the<br/>\n&gt; recipe for a &quot;Fearful Darkly Pulsing Orb&quot;:<br/>\n&gt;     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/recipe.html?recipe=2529\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/recipe.html?recipe=2529</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nCool!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; the problem is: are there people around who will by this thing?<br/>\n&gt; is it worth to &quot;hunt&quot; for some components which can be considered<br/>\n&gt; rare drops, or are off mobs in &quot;not-so-easy-zones&quot; (not everyone<br/>\n&gt; can hunt in cazic for example).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nYeah.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; also bazaar is somewhat &quot;ugly&quot; about prices, on the other hand<br/>\n&gt; you also can be very lucky in there. let&#39;s go back to the example<br/>\n&gt; from the start: one weekend (fr to mo morning) i sold about 1500<br/>\n&gt; heady kiolas (and i couldn&#39;t click anymore), then it took about<br/>\n&gt; 5 days to sell 200 again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nAgain, this would work if I could actually go to the bazaar and not go LD<br/>\nwithin 2 seconds. That is the longest I have been able to be in the bazaar<br/>\nin months. and then had to get GM to move me bc I couldn&#39;t even make it to<br/>\nthe zone. As soon as I tried to move I got black screen and &quot;YOU HAVE BEEN<br/>\nDISCONNECTED&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; when i bought my first horse (proud to be able to spent 9k) i<br/>\n&gt; witnessed when a monk bought a 100k horse for his girlfriend.<br/>\n&gt; nice gift indeed... could really need such friends as well... ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI need nice friends like that...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; one more hint about bazaar: hit F9 (or was it F10) to look<br/>\n&gt; from above to ground. it isn&#39;t easy to &quot;navigate&quot;, but the &quot;speed&quot;<br/>\n&gt; improvement is worth it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nYeah, but by the time I can actually hit a key I&#39;m kicked. :-( It takes me<br/>\n10 minutes to zone in and then boom. disconnected.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; another hint about gfx: i only enable &quot;new models&quot; for the chars<br/>\n&gt; that have horses. all other additional features are turned off.<br/>\n&gt; zoning is faster, and i have less &quot;gfx lag&quot;. i only have P3 systems<br/>\n&gt; with 512MB, but that way i could play much smoother again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI disabled most models. I have an AMD Athlon 1.4Ghz processor and 1GB of DDR<br/>\nSDRAM. But I still get kicked from bazaar bc of my internet connection.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ooops ... i have to stop now... getting late to work, again...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nheh. Have fun at work!<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
