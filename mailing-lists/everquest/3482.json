Soon the market will<br/>\nbe flooded with Sony Zombies buying everything related to Sony and<br/>\nEverquest. The brainwashing is working perfectly! <br/>\nThe fools! Do they not realize the power that Sony has over them? <br/>\nDo they not realize the contributions they are making to the<br/>\ncapitalistic ways of the Sony Clan? <br/>\nAs long as this plan holds there is no telling how far it can go! Sony<br/>\nwill rule the world!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n(he, he, he. Sorry, don&#39;t know where that came from!) Anyway I really<br/>\nneed to get back to playing Everquest!<br/>\n<br/>\n(Acts very jittery and rubs inside of arm intensely.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n Message: 7<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 30 Jul 2002 08:56:01 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n   From: Melanie Roark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melanie_6602@...\">melanie_6602@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Digest Number 543<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I got lucky.
