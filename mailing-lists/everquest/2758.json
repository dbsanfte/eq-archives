Since you have done it,<br/>\n&gt;could you explain?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a quick rundown, it&#39;s really quite simple and<br/>\nbeing a druid, safe as always. By the level you&#39;re at<br/>\nyou should realize that we never die, we just gate.<br/>\n*grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, always try to do it in an unpopulated area,<br/>\npeople around especially at lower levels are a real<br/>\npain. Nothing worse than having some jerk snare one of<br/>\nthe mobs you&#39;re quadding. (completely ruins the quad,<br/>\nyou&#39;re likely best off gating at that point)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou start by finding four mobs, preferably identical<br/>\nones that you know are well suited to quad kiting.<br/>\n(Snow Cougars, Ulthorks, and Wyverns are well known<br/>\nfor it, Wyverns will get you thru the low 50s I<br/>\nbelieve) Snare one, find another, repeat til you have<br/>\nfour snared and angrily chasing you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have all four up, back away so that the mobs<br/>\nstart to group together a little. Explaining this is a<br/>\nlittle tricky, but basically if there&#39;s two mobs<br/>\nsnared, one ahead and to the left, one ahead and to<br/>\nthe right, if you continue backing up eventually<br/>\nthey&#39;ll come together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter they&#39;re loosely grouped together, run circles<br/>\naround the mobs just outside of their melee range to<br/>\nget them grouped right on top of each other. They have<br/>\nto be VERY close together, it sounds tricky but really<br/>\nit isn&#39;t. If you&#39;re not sure, do another circle around<br/>\nbefore casting.<br/>\n<br/>\nok, so now you have four angry and closely grouped<br/>\nmobs. What now? If you&#39;re lower than level 34 you run<br/>\nlike hell cause you can&#39;t quad kite yet. *grin* If<br/>\nyou&#39;re level 34, memorize the spell Lightning Strike,<br/>\nand kite like normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nLightning Strike is the first druid AOE spell, dealing<br/>\nabout 125dmg to a maximum of four targets. Just kite<br/>\nlike you normally would with a DD spell until all four<br/>\ntargets are dead. Usually this will take you from full<br/>\nmana to OOM, so don&#39;t be surprised or worried when you<br/>\nget low on mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuad Kiting usually gets you about one more mob out of<br/>\nyour mana bar than normal kiting, so it&#39;s not a huge<br/>\nincrease, but what&#39;s best about it is once you&#39;re OOM,<br/>\nyou can just hide or camo, have a seat and walk away<br/>\nfor five mins while you get your mana back. Just make<br/>\nsure Hide succeeded before walking away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf memory serves you&#39;re still 33 so you have one more<br/>\nlevel to go, take the boat to Velious to rot and root<br/>\nSnow Cougars til you get that last level, you can<br/>\nstart quadding Cougars right away and they drop Cougar<br/>\nClaw Earrings that generally sell for 250-300pp each.<br/>\nOnce the XP from Cougars starts to tail off, you can<br/>\nhead over to Eastern Wastes to do Ulthorks, which is<br/>\nwhen the money starts to pick up. (Ulthorks drop<br/>\naround 4pp in coin each, as well as ulthork hide<br/>\narmor, words/runes, velium weapons, and rarely ulthork<br/>\ntusks for a quest in CS where you can get Blue<br/>\nDiamonds among other things)<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nOnly a few days left to file! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://taxes.yahoo.ca\">http://taxes.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
