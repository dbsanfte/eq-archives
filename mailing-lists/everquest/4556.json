So here I am a level 14 warrior wanting a<br/>\nport so I go to WC and kill some Dervs while waiting<br/>\nfor a port.  Now, I just run my tail to Freeport and<br/>\ntake a book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is more in line of what we are seeing, I<br/>\nplay on Druzzil and see the same types of scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\n--- mlockridge01 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I popped into West Commons my last two sessions to<br/>\n&gt; see if I could bag <br/>\n&gt; a giant.
