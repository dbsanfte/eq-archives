","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-36878248\">First, what server?<br/>\nAnd why would your BF, start a char on a different<br/>\nserver than your chars?  Hmm guess he doesn&#39;t want you<br/>\nto twink him either lol.........<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a level 20 mage and to be honest with you, you<br/>\ndont need much under 25 since pet will work most of<br/>\nthe baddies<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean if you can get some mana increasing items, I<br/>\nwould say do it.....but your power is in your hands<br/>\nnot your clothes......hahahaha<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways plan on getting enough PP to get spells,<br/>\nespecially your pets....<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and words of advice, playing a mage can stink<br/>\nunless you have friends......since travelling to<br/>\nneriak to get the summon staff spell STINKS.....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd at 16 your pets can be either made from research<br/>\nwhich needs to be learned no matter what for other<br/>\ncool spells and killer pets, or you need to get on<br/>\nover to the Ocean of Tears and find some girl up on a<br/>\nhill, visit eq.castersrealm.com for that details.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut all in all, the mage is fun for soloing, I<br/>\nactually put mine to rest but have started him up<br/>\nagain since I am now in a guild... I hear getting into<br/>\ngroups with a mage is tough later on in the game.  But<br/>\nthey still are second to wizzies for DD spells so what<br/>\nthe heck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind, you can solo your hearts content with a<br/>\nmage so Enjoy and if you play with your RLBF,<br/>\ndepending on what class he is, he will love your pet<br/>\ntaking the beating so you can NUKE away.....<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Sheri Kendall &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skendall@...\">skendall@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just started a new mage on a different server than<br/>\n&gt; the one I usually play on<br/>\n&gt; (so I could play with my BF). Just wondering if<br/>\n&gt; anyone had any suggestions<br/>\n&gt; for gear I can get her. I totally dont want to do<br/>\n&gt; the newbie gear quests if<br/>\n&gt; I can help it. I&#39;d rather go out and buy some<br/>\n&gt; inexpensive armor.  Got a<br/>\n&gt; decent robe for now, but at level 10 she&#39;s wearing<br/>\n&gt; nothing else but cloth<br/>\n&gt; and the summoned focus items. Got any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; (sniff... I&#39;m so used to<br/>\n&gt; twinking my alts I forgot what it&#39;s like to work for<br/>\n&gt; your stuff hehe)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
