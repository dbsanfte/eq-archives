It will be <br/>\ncheaper than printing up the rest of the maps I don&#39;t have, since I <br/>\nhave been only printing maps as I need them. Plus, we ran out of ink <br/>\nand nobody in my household wants to be the one to spring for the new <br/>\nink. Probably because they know a large number of maps will be <br/>\nprinted as soon as the ink is loaded. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would really like is to have eq in a window, with a second <br/>\nmonitor to hold my data; maps, charts, lists, and recipes. I know <br/>\nthere is a hack to allow this, but I would prefer a sanctioned <br/>\nwindow. Plus I don&#39;t have the horsepower on this system to carry such <br/>\na load. My game would suffer.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwenty bucks for the atlas sounds cheaper all round.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
