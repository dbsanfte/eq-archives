Some of the things you guys are doing on the \n    movie brings back some memories. Noone on my server goes to PoA anymore, and \n    I miss it. I have the quest sandals and haste belt for monks from PoA and \n    had a blast getting them. Now people just take a group of lvl 65s up to get \n    epic parts. No weekend long raids or anything like that. But anyway, enough \n    of this old fart (since 1999 lol) reminiscing. Good job, excellent choice of \n    music, and great screenshots. Love the pink Barb at the end lol. </p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Kerudor Cooterking</p>\n    <p>63rd lvl MonkyShiner</p>\n    <p>Tunare server \n&lt;Cohesion&gt;</p></blockquote></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
