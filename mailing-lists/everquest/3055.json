The other classes are better<br/>\n&gt; if you want to play mostly by yourself, explore,<br/>\n&gt; camp items, do quests, and just generally have fun.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am playing a paladin/magician duo right now and<br/>\n&gt; they can really destroy what they are fighting,<br/>\n&gt; often as many as 4 blues at once. The last classes I<br/>\n&gt; tried were enchanter, wizard and ranger and those<br/>\n&gt; are all really weak. I wanted to play some classes<br/>\n&gt; that could kill exp giving mobs without resorting to<br/>\n&gt; any kiting techniques, and actually go into<br/>\n&gt; dungeons.  <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Su <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, June 17, 2002 5:24 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EverQuest] getting started<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Another class that might be good is shadowknight.<br/>\n&gt; The drawbacks: Good races<br/>\n&gt;   won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want<br/>\n&gt; to kill you. If you play a<br/>\n&gt;   darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally<br/>\n&gt; suck but you get pretty<br/>\n&gt;   cool armor when you can manage to find all the<br/>\n&gt; stuff you need for it. People<br/>\n&gt;   don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they think of<br/>\n&gt; tanks. They don&#39;t often<br/>\n&gt;   invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they get the<br/>\n&gt; spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;   The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can<br/>\n&gt; summon a pet to tank for you<br/>\n&gt;   while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself,<br/>\n&gt; and you get a spell that<br/>\n&gt;   snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can<br/>\n&gt; solo alot and are a good<br/>\n&gt;   asset to a group. Way later in the game you get to<br/>\n&gt; summon your own horse<br/>\n&gt;   called an Unholy Steed.<br/>\n&gt;   My brother started a shadowknight and got him to<br/>\n&gt; lvl 35 in 8 days.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Paladins are welcome in all good cities. Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; usually have problems selling<br/>\n&gt;   to merchants. Get good damage, duel wield, disarm.<br/>\n&gt; Are thought of as tanks<br/>\n&gt;   and can get into group. Can also heal and buff.<br/>\n&gt; Can even resurrect. But they<br/>\n&gt;   cannot gate. They can solo pretty well with a good<br/>\n&gt; weapon and armor. There<br/>\n&gt;   are newbie paladin armor quests for humans and<br/>\n&gt; halfelves in freeport.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Druids, not really great tanks but can snare/root<br/>\n&gt; and dot from afar. sucks<br/>\n&gt;   alot of mana. Sometimes they can charm an animal<br/>\n&gt; to attack a mob for them.<br/>\n&gt;   But then the animal turns and attacks them when<br/>\n&gt; charm wears off. They can<br/>\n&gt;   also track, port, and heal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   If you like things to be more difficult, there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; clerics. They can pretty<br/>\n&gt;   much get into any group because people always seem<br/>\n&gt; to want a healer. But<br/>\n&gt;   they can&#39;t really solo much and have alot of<br/>\n&gt; downtime from medding.<br/>\n&gt;   luv,<br/>\n&gt;   -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; It depends on your playstyle. Solo or group,<br/>\n&gt; this will matter a lot later,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; the druid you can solo all the way to level60<br/>\n&gt; with if you want and can<br/>\n&gt;   group<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; up, but the warrior will have problems crossing<br/>\n&gt; the road without getting<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; killed without a healer back him up. But the<br/>\n&gt; warrior is in need in numbers<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; in the highe end raiding game where the druid is<br/>\n&gt; an assist class.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Answer is: it depends on your goals.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; From: eclipse4449 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:perrenoud@...\">perrenoud@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Sent: Monday, June 17, 2002 4:58 AM<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Subject: [EverQuest] getting started<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; I choose to be a Ranger right at the start,<br/>\n&gt; maybe a bad choice<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; because i&#39;m dying more often then playing.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; What is the best way to get started, & and which<br/>\n&gt; character is a good<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; newbie character?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
