For instance, I see my 1H Blunt going up<br/>\n&gt; point by point on the text box, but can&#39;t see any place that shows<br/>\n&gt; what point I&#39;m at *now* in all my skills.  I have a friend who says<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s seen a screen that lists them but can&#39;t remember how to get to<br/>\n&gt; it now.  :o/<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, I was recently killed by Tovax Vmar.  I was confused at first<br/>\n&gt; but was informed he kills random newbies... Okay, I can live with that<br/>\n&gt; (even if my character didn&#39;t &lt;grin&gt;) but before he killed me he &quot;said&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Cannot open file Q2TovaxPL.txt&quot;.  What is that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lori<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
