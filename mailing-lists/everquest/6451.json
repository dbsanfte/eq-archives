Subject: \n    [EverQuest] Powerleveling<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone \n    else see PLing beyond level 20 as wrong?&nbsp; I mean, \n    if<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; you&#39;re trying to catch up to someone else to be able \n    to group with<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; them (and you&#39;ve actually gotten a toon \n    above 20 before), then I could<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; see it.&nbsp; But \n    powerleveling people up to 20+, just because they want \n    to<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; be uber and go to better zones for better drops isn&#39;t \n    teaching them<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to play their character very well, \n    IMO.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have more fun fighting and scratching my \n    way toward 70, than just<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; killing the same mobs over and \n    over until they turn blue, them moving<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to another zone \n    to kill tougher stuff.&nbsp; To me, it&#39;s the journey and<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n    learning to play your character properly.&nbsp; Nothing irks me more \n    than<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to group with someone who is level 60, but has no \n    real clue as to how<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to play their toon.&nbsp; It steals \n    from everyone in the groups good<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; experience to have to \n    &quot;take care of&quot; the newb who was PL&#39;d to 60.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n    /rant off<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n    <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
