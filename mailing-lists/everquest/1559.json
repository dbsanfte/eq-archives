After talking to<br/>\ntech support to determine that the card is indeed dead, and finding out that<br/>\nI won&#39;t get the warranty replacement until Monday at the earliest via FedEx<br/>\n(it is Thursday night/Friday morning now), I resurrected my old VooDoo 3<br/>\n3000 out of its resting place in the bottom desk drawer and installed it in<br/>\nmy PC. After going to www.3dfx.com and downloading the latest drivers and<br/>\ninstalling them, I had 3 hours of flawless EQ action in Lake of Ill Omen,<br/>\none of the laggiest zones in the game (DING 25!).<br/>\n.<br/>\nIf you ask me (yeah, I know, you didn&#39;t ask me, but oh well), I think the<br/>\nVoodoo 3 looks better than the Geforce 2 Ultra. Maybe it doesn&#39;t _perform_<br/>\nbetter -- I know the specs are far inferior -- but the images on the monitor<br/>\nsure look better, and EQ behaved better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 31, 2001 6:16 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] does anyone else have problems..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; with a voodoo3 3000?<br/>\n&gt; I have spent hours in tech support trying to get this ressolved but kept<br/>\n&gt; getting booted out to server select or desktop while waiting my turn and<br/>\n&gt; losing my place in line..<br/>\n&gt; My computer screen freezes up at random during eq.
