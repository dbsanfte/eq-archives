You have pretty<br/>\nmuch wasted that time working on your begging skill.  Why do you have<br/>\ndirection sense?  Norrath is a huge world..you will soon answer your own<br/>\nquestion on that.  And safe fall, just keep doing what you are doing to<br/>\nbuild it up, practice Mend with Safe Fall whenever you take too much damage.<br/>\nRemember you can only use Mend every 6 minutes.  I suggest working on that<br/>\nskill the most..if your skill in Mend is 5 then it will only work 5% of the<br/>\ntime.  Plus a couple things to remember as a monk do not carry more than<br/>\n14lbs..do it and your AC will suffer.  Balence your weapon skills meaning<br/>\nuse a 1hb in one hand and a hand to hand weapon in the other hand or<br/>\nwhatever.  Once you get Feign Death practice that skill as much as you can,<br/>\nit will save your life many times.  And also not all the characters are<br/>\nwhite, Eurdites are of course black and the dark elves, trolls, vah shir,<br/>\nand froglocks are their own colors/races.  Well that is it Happy Hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBloodbrood Deathdisciple &lt;Ceatlitus&gt;<br/>\nShadowknight of the 30th Season<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Robert [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rengar65@...\">Rengar65@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 22, 2004 3:16 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Questions??????<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I&#39;m new to this group and to playing EQ.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy questions may be redundant to those asked by others here or even <br/>\noff the wall but her goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes any one use begging?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have built mine to 23 (not real hi I know but the character is only <br/>\n9th level) so far all it has done is get me 2 copper and attacked <br/>\ntwice.  Not good odds (one attack per copper).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I have direction sense?  And why would you buy a compass?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a compass on my screen.  I already know what direction I am <br/>\nfacing.  My direction sense is at 200 and it still only works about <br/>\n60% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a monk, how do I improve my safe fall skill without spending all <br/>\nmy points on it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep jumping off tall things and taking damage but no improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are all the characters white?  What if I want to play a black <br/>\nperson?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell that&#39;s about it for now.
