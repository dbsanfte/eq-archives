Lets","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-599253911\">You wouldn&#39;t believe the number of people who have asked for help finding <br/>\nthe Registrar in Shar Vahl. It&#39;s hard to explain where she is, but I will <br/>\ntry. Lets start with the bridge that leads to the thicket zone, not the <br/>\nhollow... there are two bridges. Standing on the bridge to the thicket, run <br/>\ninto the city. Pass the black female vender - do NOT turn left or right, go <br/>\nstraight past her. Then turn right. There is a little passage that looks <br/>\nlike a tunnel. Go through that. You will then turn up in a little market <br/>\nsquare. The Registrar is in one of the rooms in the square. I know it&#39;s <br/>\nconfusing, but that is the best way I can explain it. Let me know if you <br/>\nneed any more help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my favorite race and class to play... well, my main is a druid, but I <br/>\nlike to do a little fighting as well. I am also fond of pets and being able <br/>\nto turn myself into another form. Because there is no class that does all of <br/>\nthat, I can&#39;t say I have a favorite. I enjoy my beastlord though. I can&#39;t <br/>\nsay what my favorite race is either... halflings are adorable, but I also <br/>\nlike Vah Shirs. However, I can&#39;t wait for Frogloks to come out!<br/>\n<br/>\n-= Mippon - Level 40 Halfling Druid =-<br/>\n-= Nevfalath - Level 8 Dark Elf Necromancer =-<br/>\n-= Areznia - Level 7 Vah Shir Beastlord =-<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
