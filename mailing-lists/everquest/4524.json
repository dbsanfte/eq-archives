With a p4 1.2 ghz,  384 MB,<br/>\n32mb geforce 2 and a 512k connection. =(<br/>\n<br/>\nNow i&#39;ve managed to get my zoning times down to less than 20 seconds =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m assuming that you have got Shadows of luclin, as this caused everybody&#39;s<br/>\nzoning times to go up when it first came out.  The main problem with SoL is<br/>\nthe RAM requirement, it really needs a minimum of 512MB to run smoothly, but<br/>\nheck i&#39;m a full time student, I took the cheap option =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI switched off some of the new &#39;Lucin&#39; character graphics and my zoning and<br/>\nloading times went right back down, I switched off just less than half of<br/>\nthe new models and now i have great performance without needing to add more<br/>\nram.<br/>\n<br/>\n(to switch off the models, on the Eq title screen, click options, keep<br/>\nclicking &#39;ok&#39; until you get to the list of character models, then uncheck<br/>\nsome of the boxes, load up eq and see how it runs).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\n(Of course, this is assuming that you have SoL installed, if not then i hope<br/>\nthat someone else can help)<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDorfl - Beastlord (50 levels and rising)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
