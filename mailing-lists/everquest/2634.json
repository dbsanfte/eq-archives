I suppose in order to &gt;camp the \n  PGT you just keep killing all the<br>gnolls in the area that Grenix spawns \n  until he does and then you kill &gt;him<br>and get the Tomahawk. I don&#39;t think \n  that is very productive for a level 30<br>ranger to do, but it would be \n  &gt;good practice. I suppose you would make some<br>money from the items the \n  gnolls dropped as well. Maybe I &gt;will camp the orcs<br>on the other side to \n  see if that guy who drops the weight reduction bag<br>shows up.<br>&gt;<br>The \n  PGT isn&#39;t that hard to get. I got it and the cracked darkwood shield a<br>few \n  times. It&#39;s more fun if you are in a gnoll killing group for xp \n  or<br>faction.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;It seems like an enchanter is a better character \n  for getting into groups<br>and being invited on epic encounters, but &gt;a \n  ranger is better for doing<br>quests and camping items.<br>&gt;<br>Since my \n  mains are a cleric and a wizard, I wouldn&#39;t \n  know.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br></tt><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
