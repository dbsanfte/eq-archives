I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1719157085\">Congrats!<br/>\nIf you have Luclin I suggest you get some friends (especially ones with vs<br/>\nundead spells) and head to Umbral Planes to hunt for Elysian Armor. I<br/>\nbrought my mother&#39;s lvl 41 druid to sit invis on the sidelines while my 56<br/>\ncleric and a 52 druid soloed the elysian mobs. She snared and dotted them<br/>\nand kited them until I rooted them and used my undead dots. I was doing<br/>\n190dmg every 6 seconds with my dots. They do have alot of HP though. and<br/>\nthey hit pretty hard. The arms dropped twice and so did the tunic. So both<br/>\ndruids got arms and tunic. It was fun!<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my druid has finally dinged level 50!!!    WOOT!!!! *MAD CELEBRATION*<br/>\n<br/>\nMan, it&#39;s been a long time coming!   If I feel this ecstatic about level 50<br/>\nthink how I&#39;m gonna be at 65!  by the time I hti that they&#39;ll have raised<br/>\nthe level cap to 70!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just recently purchased LDON but my cable modem got disconnected so I<br/>\ncould not play for like 2 months.  I moved to a new place and got cable<br/>\nmodem reconnected and finally had my first adventure tonight!!  I did the<br/>\nCollect 28 Mummy Wrappings in Mistmore, and also the Kill 60 in Mistmore.<br/>\nSuccessful on both and dinged 50 to boot!!<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to start working on my epic I guess!<br/>\n<br/>\nRaido Covenfall<br/>\n50 ELF DRU<br/>\nCazic Thule Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\naka Wulfric Rennison<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.544 / Virus Database: 338 - Release Date: 11/25/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
