I am really looking for some friends on<br/>\n&gt; everquest so i can meet people outside of my own hometown. When i<br/>\n&gt; play the game it seems like everyone is busy and really doesnt want<br/>\n&gt; to talk so i decided to come to a group where i could meet some<br/>\n&gt; people and talk and become friends in the game! So if anyone is<br/>\n&gt; interseted in becoming friends please reply or maybe chat with me<br/>\n&gt; while on everquest if ya see me!! My Name on Everquest is Curapachi<br/>\n&gt; and i am a level 10 bard/wood elf. I hope i meet ya there and we can<br/>\n&gt; become friends! Bye!!! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
