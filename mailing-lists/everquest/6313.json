My modem would not work with a router at all so we had to use a hub instead. It was working fine for months but all of a sudden we started having problems with connection. We didn&#39;t change any of the settings or anythings. It mostly was a problem with loading webpages. I think it has something to do with the web accelerator software my ISP uses. The modem itself has software on it that the ISP sends to it but the accelerator stuff has always been a bit wonky, but it didn&#39;t seem to interfere with EQ before.<br/>\nI really don&#39;t know what the problem is.<br/>\nI have a Direcway 6000 2-way external modem hooked to an 8 port hub. Even when none of the other computers are accessing the internet, I still have problems with connection now. I can&#39;t get cable or even dialup out here so it&#39;s very frustrating.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-08-07, 13:38:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Make sure any ports that need to be mapped on your router are mapped, and if<br/>\n&gt;you have a firewall now that you didn&#39;t have before, that it&#39;s set to allow<br/>\n&gt;what EQ requests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We had a problem with being able to connect after our ISP finally realized<br/>\n&gt;we were using an outdated &quot;DSL manager&quot; program they&#39;d supplied several<br/>\n&gt;years ago and for an older, identical appearing modem and when we replaced<br/>\n&gt;it last year after it went tits up unexpectedly, we continued with the same<br/>\n&gt;until out of the blue, it stopped working. A few very puzzled calls later,<br/>\n&gt;we had it changed to treating the modem as if it were any normal router, but<br/>\n&gt;still not working right with EQ. Spent some more time with tech support and<br/>\n&gt;we find out not only is our little modem a router in disguise, it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;hardware firewall also...and that aspect of it was turned on with the same<br/>\n&gt;changes we had to make to connect. We had to turn the firewall feature off<br/>\n&gt;to be able to connect to EQ, most IRC servers, and pretty much anything<br/>\n&gt;beyond basic email and web browsing. If you&#39;ve made any recent changes to<br/>\n&gt;your configuration, even just a router firmware update, please look into<br/>\n&gt;that as a possible cause.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, if you do find it&#39;s something like that, make sure you have a good<br/>\n&gt;software firewall to take up the slack. I like Tiny Personal<br/>\n&gt;Firewall....very easy to configure and lives up to its name on resources.<br/>\n&gt;Sygate Firewall did it&#39;s basic job extremely well before that, and was also<br/>\n&gt;extremely easy to configure, but over time got to be wickedly unstable and<br/>\n&gt;then finally refused to play nicely with the second NIC, so it had to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.10.1/64 - Release Date: 8/4/2005</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
