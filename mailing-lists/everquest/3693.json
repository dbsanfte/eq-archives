My guild is <br/>\nquickly growing,  and starting to do Higher level raids.  Many of our <br/>\nmembers have not had much experience raiding, so we have been <br/>\ndoing &quot;training&quot; raids.  We are still having people not listening, <br/>\nand ending up causing TPW&#39;s.  If any of you have any Guids to <br/>\nraiding,  and/or rules that your guild has,  please send them to me <br/>\nso I can design something tailored to my guild.<br/>\n&gt; Any personal advice is welcomed also.<br/>\n&gt;     OH,  Barto,  you should try Iceclad Ocean on Velious, and fight <br/>\nthe cougars.
