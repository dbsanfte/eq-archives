Or to make money. Brewing allows you to make sauces for cooking, tempers for smithing, tannins for tailoring, etc. Baking, smithing, tailoring, poisonmaking, and brewing are all needed for the rogue epic 2.0. My brother was lucky that I had skilled up my tradeskills for the 8th shawl quest because I was able to make everything he needed but the poison and no drop stuff for his epic. I farmed stuff and spent days skilling up his tradeskills for him and then got him all of the droppable things he needed. My being able to make stuff saved alot of time though. Because he only needed to be high enough to do the no drop parts.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-03-14, 02:24:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Howdy,<br/>\n&gt;    I&#39;m relatively new to EQ, an I&#39;m sill feeling my way around things. I do havfe a question. No th Trade skills, Im understand most of them, they&#39;re pretty straitforward...but I do have a question bout the cooking one. Why? I understand smithing...get ore, make bars, make weapons/armour...I know in EQ, every so many time units, you automaticlly eat food. Since rations and milk will fill this funcion,  what is the purpose of cookin and brewing? Do you get more food value out of something you&#39;ve made, as oppoised to the rations and bisquits? Can you eat the food and get boosts from it? Same thing for the brewing? Or is it just a vanity thing to be walking around with something you cooked as opposed to the iron raions and milk thing...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,<br/>\n&gt;butcher a hog, design a building, con a ship, write a sonnet, balance<br/>\n&gt;accounts, build a wall, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders,<br/>\n&gt;cooperate, act alone, solve an equation, analyze a new problem, pitch<br/>\n&gt;manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die<br/>\n&gt;gallantly. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Specialization is for insects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Robert A.
