It&#39;s really easy to get<br/>\nto if you have Planes of Power too, just take the Cabillis port and head<br/>\nstraight for the huge tower (just don&#39;t go anywher near to Cabillis itself).<br/>\nIt&#39;s fantastic xp, either solo the floor where you zone in and the floor<br/>\nabove or get a group and head into the basement.  The skellies here are<br/>\neasier that their level suggests (something very rare in eq). I remember<br/>\nstarting a new iksar when kunark was released and killing yellow cons with<br/>\nmy tarnished sword :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have PoP, Kurn&#39;s can be tough to get to.  My favorite place<br/>\nbefore PoP came out was Unrest. This place is famous for it&#39;s trains, but if<br/>\nyou follow the zone wall to the left and pull things to the side wall, you<br/>\nshould aviod all of the trains.  You should easily be able to solo Death<br/>\nbeetles, Tormented dead and greater skellies, just stick to the things on<br/>\nthe grass and keep out of the house and you should get great xp from 15 to<br/>\nabout 17 (yay! dual wield time).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you hit 17, head to Paludal, get a group at the bandits and you will be<br/>\nlvl 25 before you know it =)<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n______________________________________<br/>\nDorfl - 52 Beastlord on Torvo<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=452875\">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=452875</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
