Its allways best to sneak behind.  Once you have the hide<br/>\nskill you will hide first (make sure you get the msg that you have hid<br/>\nsuccesfully) then sneak (again make sure you get the right msg) at this<br/>\npoint you will be invisible to almost every mob in the game (there are some<br/>\nthat will see you, but most will not, con them to see).<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) Without going into a long reason as to why, yes it is allways better to<br/>\nattack mobs from behind, even if you are not a rogue (unless your main tank<br/>\nthen sure you dont want to be attacking from behind much that means he is<br/>\nhitting someone else).  Plus its good practice for you to attack from<br/>\nbehind.  You are a Rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.) Sense traps tells you where the traps are.  Disarm, well, disarms them.<br/>\nAnd yes there are many traps in Velious (Velks Labryinth, Dragon Necropolis,<br/>\nPlane of Mischief, Skyshrine maybe more).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Miewald@...\">John_Miewald@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Miewald@...\">John_Miewald@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 22, 2001 12:28 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Hi, I am new & stupid :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a brand spankin&#39; new rogue and I have some questions.  I would<br/>\ngreatly appreciate any feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  How does &quot;sneak&quot; work exactly?  Can I sneak across someone&#39;s line of<br/>\nsight?  What is the difference between &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; that comes later?<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.  Does it do me any good to<br/>\nattack monsters from behind without the ability yet?  I have been making an<br/>\neffort to do just that, but should I not even bother?<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot recall<br/>\nhaving ever seen or heard of a trap in EQ.  Can anyone give an example of<br/>\nwhere and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>\nthere is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Alazais&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
