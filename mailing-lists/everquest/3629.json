Movie quality graphics. <br/>\n<br/>\nSigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I will go back to sleep, now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto<br/>\nLiving on today&#39;s yesterday formerly ok technology.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Kuervodr@n... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Yes I am running with Luclin, with about 14 of the new models, and <br/>\nthe new UI. Right now I only have 256mb (Samsung DDR333 PC2700) of <br/>\nmemory, but I plan to increase that in the next few weeks. It came <br/>\nstock with a Chaintech GF2 MX400 64MB agp card which runs quite well. <br/>\nSurprised me a bit because my older system also has a GF2 MX400 in <br/>\nit, but runs soooo much slower, possibly because it&#39;s a pci card I <br/>\nsuppose. Bus speed is still at the norm 100..possibly 133 but I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink so. It&#39;s an Asus P4S533 Mobo with the SiS 645dx chipset that <br/>\nhas gotten quite good reviews. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have noticed spell effects drag down my fps quite a bit, but <br/>\nstill quite playable. In a raid situation I would probably turn them <br/>\noff. The bazaar is a little laggy if I don&#39;t have the clip plane <br/>\ndown, altho if I only have the old character models enabled I can set <br/>\nthe clip plane to about 50% before I get bad lag. All this, I&#39;m <br/>\nassuming, is because of the video card limitations. Quite probably it <br/>\nis your problem (mostly) as well. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scanning through Pricewatch.com I noticed some pretty good prices <br/>\non the GF3 ti200 and ti500. So I will likely be going with <br/>\nthat....but then again the GF5s should be coming out within the next <br/>\nfew weeks (according to a magazine article I read) I think, and the <br/>\nprices should fall even further...<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Rob LeBeau &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: RE: Network setup help<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hey can I ask if you have Luclin and use the new ui?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If so, can you tell me the Amount of Ram in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;system, the video ram, and the bus speed if you happen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to know it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the reason I ask is I bought a new machine Intel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Celeron 1.2Ghz processor with over 300 MB ram and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Nvidia 32MB ram card. The game runs ok but I can&#39;t use<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the new UI else I get Mouse lag or hesitation like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;MAD.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And when spells are cast, the mouse is VERY slow.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the graphics are fine though and actually run smooth.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have about 15 Luclin graphic images turned on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Let me know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Your favorite stores, helpful shopping tools and great gift ideas. <br/>\nExperience the convenience of buying online with Shop@Netscape! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shopnow.netscape.com/\">http://shopnow.netscape.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape Mail account today at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com/\">http://webmail.netscape.com/</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
