Thought it couldn&#39;t be that bad,<br/>\nbut I had never been to Chardok before.  The mission<br/>\nwas to enter the fort inside Chardok and explore the<br/>\narea around the first bridge.  Went in and found the<br/>\nfort (was invised) opened the door, it squeaks and<br/>\nevery mob in Chardok seems to have heard it, and what<br/>\nresulted can only be described as Woodelf paste.<br/>\n--- Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I tried one task.  There are 3 Task Masters in POK. <br/>\n&gt; And I believe at least 1 in every home town.  Just<br/>\n&gt; hail them.   They will give you a list of tasks to<br/>\n&gt; choose from.  Rezize your task window to see the<br/>\n&gt; rewards.  These tasks are not easily soloable, but<br/>\n&gt; if you get a group you can finish them fairly<br/>\n&gt; quickly.  My first task was to collect 4 bone chips<br/>\n&gt; and kill 10 reanimated mobs in Chardok.  It took<br/>\n&gt; awhile but it was good xp and a 58pp reward.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Raido<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Chris <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, September 21, 2004 1:54 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Task system<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I just got Omens of War, and I&#39;ve been trying to<br/>\n&gt; find information <br/>\n&gt;   about the new task system.
