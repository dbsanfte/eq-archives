What&#39;s rude is taking 30+ people to a raid and not<br/>\ngetting what you came for beacause you also broght people that can&#39;t do the<br/>\nraid for one or another reason. One person delaying for half a minute while<br/>\nafk making coffe or what ever will make up for a total loss of 15 minute if<br/>\nyou count every persons missed time. One person causing a 2 hour CR we<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t even talk about. If you got the need to go afk every 10:th minute,<br/>\nif you can&#39;t listen or if you don&#39;t know what you are doing you shouldnt<br/>\nattend the high lvl raiding game. It&#39;s to time consuming for other people.<br/>\nThen again, if you are raiding with people that doesn&#39;t care if they lose a<br/>\nevening due to people not paying attention or whatever reason it is i guess<br/>\nit&#39;s fine. <br/>\nBut i know i wouldn&#39;t put up with that shit. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t set aside much time for EQ so i want the time i use for EQ to be<br/>\ngood, either for me, my friends or my guild. If that makes me rude then<br/>\nmaybe i am rude. But i know that from the time i led raids my tolerant lvl<br/>\nwas low, very low. People may have called me harsh but they DID learn the<br/>\ngame and DID learn to pay attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the spamm part, you&#39;ll learn, either by misstake or someone telling<br/>\nyou. That&#39;s not a problem, the problem is with people not listening or<br/>\nshutting up during events.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure your playstyle differs alot from mine, so i wanted to<br/>\nfinnish of telling you that this ain&#39;t a flame in any way, it&#39;s me stating<br/>\nwhat i put up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to the 3 most important rules about raiding (cept a raid leader(s)<br/>\nthat knows what they are doing, it&#39;s their fault if the raid fails, no one<br/>\nelse to blame).<br/>\n<br/>\n1, Listen up and pay attention.<br/>\n2, Know your class.<br/>\n3, Shut the fuck up, don&#39;t use shout or the raid channel for unimportant<br/>\nstuff like asking for buffs etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m gonna try to dig out a pretty good document about EQ raiding, it has it<br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\n-domi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: den 11 september 2002 06:49<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: Raid Guide<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; People don&#39;t listen because they don&#39;t want to listen,<br/>\n&gt; plain and simple.  It is the biggest problem in raiding,<br/>\n&gt; by far.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree. Maybe some people don&#39;t want to listen but not all. Some people<br/>\ntry very hard but because of lag or too much spam miss things.<br/>\nI had problems on my first raid to Hate because I kept missing messages<br/>\nbecause I kept getting spammed with too many spell messages and at the time,<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know how to turn them off. I also lagged and did not receive messages<br/>\nin time to take action.<br/>\nMaybe people get distracted sometimes. But it is just a game. Real life can<br/>\ninterfere.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The best way to get attention and keep attention is to<br/>\n&gt; boot people from raids that don&#39;t listen.  Have a person<br/>\n&gt; wandering off after repeated tells to stay in camp, TL<br/>\n&gt; him/her out.  It&#39;s the easiest way to get their<br/>\n&gt; attention.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would only work if they accepted the TL.<br/>\nAnd I would never use that tactic with my own guildies. That&#39;s just rude.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a game. It should be fun. And yeah, getting wiped out from someone not<br/>\nlistening isn&#39;t very fun, but I think it&#39;s even less fun to be nasty to<br/>\npeople.<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
