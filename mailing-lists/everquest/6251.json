All of thse items aim for a strong balance bt int, raw mana,<br/>\nand cha.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 44, Camenae (my Dark Elf chanty) has had her int maxed for about 7<br/>\nlevels, and cha of 240 with most of her gear still needing to mature. Once<br/>\nshe gets 55 or so, even with no gear changes she&#39;ll easily cap. I did throw<br/>\na couple of Radiantcut Skyflows her way to help things along, but prolly 50+<br/>\nto 60 they&#39;ll be mostly wasted as her gear matures but her cap remains low.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any of the token cha-only, no int/mana gear I see a lot of<br/>\nchanters use, tho I did use a 12 cha 12 dex ring for a few levels til I<br/>\ncould use a Glowing Magma Ring and toss another aug in to bring the cha back<br/>\nup.  I do have a few &quot;lower end&quot; items on her, such as a bracer from LS<br/>\nthat&#39;s matured by 10, but again, it was chosen for the balance of the stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 44, she has 2.7k mana pool, 2.1k hps, and has pulled my ass outta the<br/>\nfire more times than I can count...mezzes land very reliably and mana is<br/>\nplentiful. Now if only Discordant Mind was resisted less....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: mushuplus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mushuplus@...\">mushuplus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 27, 2005 9:40 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Enchanters<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Anybody know some good equip for chanties?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
