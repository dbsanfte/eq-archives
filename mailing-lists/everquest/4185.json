I also like to play on<br/>\n&gt; consoles. I find <br/>\n&gt; the style of game play is quite different in each<br/>\n&gt; medium.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ultimately the consoles prove the easiest and least<br/>\n&gt; expensive to buy <br/>\n&gt; and upgrade. Generally a console and two games,<br/>\n&gt; maybe a few more <br/>\n&gt; items, can be had for $300.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is hard to put a decent pc together for gaming<br/>\n&gt; for under $1000. <br/>\n&gt; About double that will net a decent machine with<br/>\n&gt; upgrade potential, <br/>\n&gt; but without the need to upgrade for some time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The upper end of pc gaming runs around $8000. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Obviously, more people can buy in for $300 than for<br/>\n&gt; the $1000 plus.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Part of me wants to be a pc hotrodder, and build an<br/>\n&gt; ubermachine. Big, <br/>\n&gt; bad, and hot. With adequate cooling, as well. That<br/>\n&gt; part of me does <br/>\n&gt; not have access to the purse. Sadly, real life<br/>\n&gt; expenses have first <br/>\n&gt; claim on my wallet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, I am watching the trends, and encouraging myself<br/>\n&gt; to adopt the <br/>\n&gt; philosophy that I am a gamer, and the platform is<br/>\n&gt; less important than <br/>\n&gt; the experience. It is within the scope of<br/>\n&gt; possibility, and probably <br/>\n&gt; in the path of great profitability for the makers,<br/>\n&gt; that console <br/>\n&gt; online multiplayer games will be of such game<br/>\n&gt; quality in the future <br/>\n&gt; that holding onto the pc platform will be only an<br/>\n&gt; option, and not a <br/>\n&gt; necessity.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alternately, I can see online game manufacturers<br/>\n&gt; selling systems to <br/>\n&gt; insure their audience is there. Wouldn&#39;t that be<br/>\n&gt; grand? Order the <br/>\n&gt; game and the system all for one monthly payment.<br/>\n&gt; Upgrade components <br/>\n&gt; will be shipped when software demands require it.<br/>\n&gt; Your system will <br/>\n&gt; always be current.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What will the future hold? I don&#39;t know, but I am<br/>\n&gt; sure I cannot be <br/>\n&gt; shelling out several thousand dollars every other<br/>\n&gt; year. The cost has <br/>\n&gt; to be brought in line with the spending capacity of<br/>\n&gt; a large audience, <br/>\n&gt; or else the hobby will suffer decline.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
