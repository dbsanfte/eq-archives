Sell what you <br/>\ncan and do buy your spells as money and level allow. The newbie <br/>\nperiod is one of learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a druid you will want to either build your tailoring and smithing <br/>\nskills or get to know someone who does these things. You can only <br/>\nwear leather armor, and making it is a good way to go. I am a level <br/>\n29 halfling druid (primary character) and I am currently making <br/>\nreinforced armor for myself and others. To do so I had to learn <br/>\ntailoring, smithing, and brewing. To make my special magic halfling <br/>\nleather armor I will need to advance these skills farther. Since I <br/>\nenjoy the challenge of skills as much as leveling, this is fun for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy your newbie time. This time will help you establish your style <br/>\nof play, learn to navigate and hunt, learn to play with others, and <br/>\nestablish you gaming goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet to know the gaming sites. Start with those which have been <br/>\nsuggested. Explore others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI printed out the zone connection maps and zone maps and keep the <br/>\ninformation handy when I play. I now know many zones well enough that <br/>\nI don&#39;t need the maps, but others have questions I can answer if I <br/>\nhave the map handy. For exploring new zones the maps and other <br/>\ninformation makes learning easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt times other players will be helpful. Sometimes they are busy with <br/>\nquests or personal goals and haven&#39;t time to help. Once in a while a <br/>\nmature player will look for newbies to help, and that is great. Other <br/>\ntimes you will be very much on your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Hunting to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;rlebeau65&quot; &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have just bought the Everquest trilogy box and have played a few <br/>\n&gt; times.  I have found a few helpful people out there but it seems <br/>\nmost <br/>\n&gt; are playing solo. Is this normal?  They suggest grouping so that is <br/>\n&gt; my first question.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Next, I am having trouble getting money to get decent weapons.<br/>\n&gt; I am a level 3 Druid and only have a club.  One guy gave me some <br/>\n&gt; money but it wasn&#39;t much.  He suggested buying more spells, but I <br/>\n&gt; really would like a good weapon.  Dealing 1-3 points of damage just <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t cutting it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lastly for now, should I be starting with a fighter type until I <br/>\n&gt; really get use the the game and interface.  I really love wizards <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; those type of characters but understand if playing a warrior makes <br/>\nit <br/>\n&gt; easier.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I always get confused on where I am going. I think I venture too <br/>\nfar <br/>\n&gt; out of the city area.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you for letting the newbie post?  ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rob </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
