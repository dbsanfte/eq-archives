I&#39;ve got a lumberjack&#39;s cap, splitpaw gloves, and a<br/>\nbrown chitin protector right now, but everything else is leather armor.<br/>\nI&#39;ve also got a black enameled mace.  What sort of upgrades would make the<br/>\nmost sense right now?  Is there a piece or two of armor that I can&#39;t live<br/>\nwithout?  I can&#39;t afford anything in the thousands, but I could swing a<br/>\ncouple hundred plats or a bit more for a good piece of armor.  I know it&#39;s<br/>\nbeen said that I won&#39;t melee much after lvl 20, but I still want to keep up<br/>\nmy battle skills.  Besides, I mostly solo and enjoy banging on something<br/>\nevery once in a while when its hps have gotten low.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m on Terris Thule, by the way :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
