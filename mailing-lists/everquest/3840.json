What was the<br/>\nproblem last year when it happened?<br/>\n<br/>\nIF all else fails, maybe reinstall EQ, maybe you have<br/>\na corrupt file.  Have you messed with the EQ skins at<br/>\nall?<br/>\nOr maybe even the eqclient.ini file.  If so, rename<br/>\nthe ini file and it will create a new one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get this write back or look for me on Yahoo<br/>\nchat as rlebeau65.
