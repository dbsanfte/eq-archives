When I played EQ the <br/>\nother day, I went to the OVERTHERE.  Instead of seeing the usual <br/>\ncreatures (succulents, rhinos, Sarnaks and tigers), I see only <br/>\nvarious sizes of human men.  Now this computer is supposed to have a <br/>\ntop line graphic card, so I&#39;m not sure how to adjust my settings to <br/>\nsee the normal bestiary for this area.  Does anyone know what I <br/>\nshould adjust to get things back to normal?   <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
