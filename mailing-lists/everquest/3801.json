People make mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome mistakes aren&#39;t that unbalancing and are safe to keep in the game and work around. Others can sometimes <br/>\nyield gameplay that turns out to be even more fun than developers even imagined, as ingenious adventurers <br/>\ndiscover unrealized potential in their abilities.  Yet others, even the best-intentioned ones, can cause an entire style <br/>\nof gameplay to shift dramatically in a direction that no one particularly enjoys.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, today, we need to address a number of the latter kind.  For that, we sincerely apologize. It is <br/>\nabsolutely our fault that certain abilities have been allowed to grow out of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our last letter, we stated that our goal for large scale battles in EverQuest was never one of endurance contests. <br/>\nWe&#39;d prefer to actively return to the type of battles that everyone feels are more fun - Battles that require tactics and <br/>\nskill, as opposed to attendance and endurance.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to some specific abilities as they exist today in EverQuest, this unfortunately isn&#39;t possible. The mathematics <br/>\nsimply cannot be made to work. In extreme cases such as that, the abilities themselves must be altered.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t possible, for example, to ever make another fast-action, do-or-die-quickly style encounter as long as <br/>\nManaburn exists in its current form, unless it is targeted solely at an entire group of people who have this ability, as <br/>\nit will otherwise be trivial to those who do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, it isn&#39;t possible to create encounters that must be completed in a certain amount of time due to mana <br/>\nconsumption, when Rods of Mystical Transvergence provide an essentially unlimited source of mana. Every <br/>\nchallenging encounter must also be challenging for the massive raid of people who have infinite mana, and the <br/>\nencounter then becomes undoable to those who do not have the infinite supply.<br/>\n<br/>\nHypothetically, the only alternative to changing abilities such as these would be to inflate every other class up to <br/>\nthe same tier of relative power (be it damaging power, or mana regenerative power), then inflate the rest of the world <br/>\nto compensate for the sudden rash of new found power. Drastic, world-wide changes of that sort, however, are a <br/>\nguaranteed way to do more harm than good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time has come to address these abilities. Fortunately, after doing so, EverQuest as a whole, and the <br/>\nencounters in Planes of Power, will be able to be tuned for forces who are interested in active participation in the <br/>\ngame, as opposed to those forced to sit through yet another 45 minute encounter with a single NPC, as became <br/>\nthe norm in Luclin.<br/>\n<br/>\nManaburn. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to the problem described above, this ability was never intended to be a way for small bands of high level <br/>\nplayers to hold hostage the advancement of larger numbers of more appropriately leveled people. While this was <br/>\nnot the universal case, it has unfortunately happened enough across most servers to where it became a large <br/>\nconcern in recent months.  The concept of someone looking to complete their epic quest via teamwork and <br/>\novercoming the odds, only to have their attempts obstructed, in some cases, by small teams of players looking to <br/>\nprofit financially from their power, quite frankly, is not a behavior that we wish the game to reinforce.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the next patch, Wizards who have purchased Manaburn will find that their ability points have been refunded. <br/>\nPlease make sure that you have fewer than 25 pooled Ability points.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point, they will be able to purchase a new Manaburn if they choose, which has most of the power of the old <br/>\none. However, the new Manaburn leaves a temporary effect on its target when used that does not stack with other <br/>\nManaburns.  The delay that we will be tuning on the Test Server soon will allow a single target to be manaburned no <br/>\nmore frequently than once every minute. <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, this will bring the ability back in line with the original intent -- A powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do <br/>\nmassive short-term damage, but not a method for a group of wizards to destroy powerful creatures with zero risk. <br/>\n<br/>\nRods of Mystical Transvergence. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe description above shows how this spell has perhaps singlehandedly altered the balance of the end-game <br/>\nencounter by turning it into an event where the largest challenge is setting up a timed rotation of Complete Healing.  <br/>\nOnce that is established, in many cases, the event is just as playable by leaving AutoAttack on, and wandering <br/>\naway to watch television. This does not make for stellar interactive content.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe view Magicians as an excellent source of damage, especially with the many pet enhancements that have been <br/>\nmade over the past year. To be honest, it is a more than a small shame that their full energies have been viewed as <br/>\n&quot;needed&quot; to be spent, full-time, purely on transferring their mana to others. Magicians are supposed to be the <br/>\nmasters of elemental conjuration and highly respected as a damage-dealer, not the masters of mana transferrence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the next update, Rods of Mystical Transvergence will be changed so that the spell summons an item that is still <br/>\na valuable upgrade over the original Modulation Rod, yet does not provide an infinite amount of mana.  The idea of <br/>\nsudden mana gain spells is only balanced if there is a net loss over time to counteract the rapid infusion.  The initial <br/>\nversion of the spell that we will be testing summons a Rod containing a single charge of 360 mana for 450 hit <br/>\npoints, and can only be used by a person once each minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, the Rods themselves will be non-droppable, and spell will turn into a &quot;target based summon,&quot; such that <br/>\nthe Magician summons them directly onto the recipient, as opposed to having to hand them out manually or create <br/>\na stockpile on the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince there are definitely encounters in the game where this type of mana regeneration is mandatory for the <br/>\nencounter to be beaten by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters will likewise be re-tuned to <br/>\nshorten their duration, most frequently by lowering the hit points on the NPC in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, our intent here is provide Magicians with a desirable secondary ability that would ideally be used before a <br/>\nbattle, not an ability which essentially compels them to suddenly transform into a full-time support role, transferring <br/>\ntheir mana to others, as opposed to dealing damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nComplete Healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of any class getting their single best, most efficient primary ability at level 39, has never sat well with <br/>\nmost people. In the days of characters having a maximum of 2000-4000 hit points, the spell was absolutely not <br/>\nimbalancing. However, as time went on and characters progressed, now doubling that amount of hit points, it <br/>\nbecomes obvious that the spell must be scaled back slightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis spell has, over time, become the defining cornerstone of the Cleric class. As such, it cannot be altered <br/>\nsignificantly. Taking that into account, and given that those with the most hit points in EverQuest have yet to hit the <br/>\nfull 10,000 HP cap of this spell, the spell will remain nearly as useful as it is today, by being reclassified as a spell <br/>\nthat heals for 7,500 hit points, down from its current cap of 10,000.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will allow it to continue to be used as it has been in the past, while allowing for more dynamic types of heals to <br/>\nbe introduced in the future. Making this change will allow us to providing more entertaining high-end encounters that <br/>\nrequire more active involvement than setting up a Complete Healing &quot;Rotation&quot; or &quot;Chain,&quot; then repeating the same <br/>\nmotions until the Large Thing you are facing, eventually falls down.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk Defense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.  Monks in EverQuest were <br/>\noriginally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment.  This ability <br/>\ncame at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, <br/>\nrestrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character.  It <br/>\ndid not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as &quot;Monk Loot,&quot; <br/>\nas far back as before the launch of Kunark.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, Monks&#39; defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness.  This, taken in <br/>\ncombination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly <br/>\ntransformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game.  Monks get hit less than any <br/>\nother class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game <br/>\nto have their proper relative power.  The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive <br/>\nabilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive <br/>\nabilities to compensate for this.  Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than <br/>\naltering the one class.  Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is <br/>\ncontributing to this problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMonk defense will be altered somewhat.  It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character&#39;s Armor Class does not <br/>\ncompare equally across different classes.  (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, <br/>\nfor example.)  It&#39;s not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to <br/>\nget used to.  As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, <br/>\nhowever, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it.  What we are <br/>\nprimarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, <br/>\nfollowed by the Chain classes and Monks.  The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to <br/>\nmake up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn closing, we would like to again apologize for the amount of time that we&#39;ve allowed these abilites to remain in <br/>\ntheir current state. With Planes of Power on the horizon, in order to make encounters that most people would <br/>\nconsider &quot;fun,&quot; these abilities and class attributes need to be brought back into line as sane upgrades and logical <br/>\nprogressions, as opposed to their current manifestations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe appreciate the many well thought-out letters that have been sent in on these topics and more.  As always, we <br/>\nthank you for playing EverQuest and look forward to seeing you soon in the Planes of Power.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Development Team<br/>\n=== copy of text - end ===<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik<br/>\nlevel 54 female gnome magician<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
