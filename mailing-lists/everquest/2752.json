The WIS maximum has always been 255, but before<br/>\nLuclin WIS above 200 only gave one point of mana per<br/>\npoint of WIS. They loosened the soft cap around the<br/>\nrelease of Luclin, so now each point of WIS above 200<br/>\ngives around 5-6 mana. In my experience (44 Druid is<br/>\nmy main) the best bet is to get WIS up to the 200 cap<br/>\nthen start shopping for resist and mana items. There&#39;s<br/>\nquite a few very inexpensive items with major WIS<br/>\nboosts available.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the other guy, at 33 you&#39;re high enough to be<br/>\nleveling in Velious, i&#39;d recommend heading over there<br/>\nASAP. I started by root and rotting Snow Cougars in<br/>\nIceclad til 34, then quad kiting them til 38. (I<br/>\nbelieve it was 38 that they started conning light<br/>\nblue, might have been 37) From there you can do<br/>\nDrakkel Dire Wolves in GD for faction or quad Ulthorks<br/>\nin EW for amazing loot and good xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe side perk of hunting in Velious is that&#39;s where<br/>\nthe higher levels tend to congregate these days. Drop<br/>\nyour bind at the bank in Thurg and keep an eye out for<br/>\nthose 100pp port requests. *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nOnly a few days left to file! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://taxes.yahoo.ca\">http://taxes.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
