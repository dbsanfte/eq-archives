Clerics are a lot of fun \nimo. As a new cleric I agree with some of the statements made below. Being BRAND \nnew, just solo around your starting point and loot everything. Sell that stuff \nand save all the money. You will need it for spells obviously and you&#39;ll also \nwant to pick up some better armor than the tunic your guild gives you. I wore \nleather armor for a very long time until I had saved enough to buy something \nelse. </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">When you do get higher&nbsp;in level and can start \nbuying some better items, work on buying stuff that is +wis. This will help a \nlot. Farther down the road at much higher levels you will want to work on making \nyour AC and saves better, but you shouldn&#39;t have to worry about that too much \nfor quite some time.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Everyone has different opinions on how to play, but \nthe important thing is to have fun. Find some people on your server that play in \nyour area. Usually you&#39;ll start seeing familiar faces. </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Lyli</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">50 Cleric of Xegony</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Dark Reign Order</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:etop03@...\" title=\"etop03@...\">Cook \n  Miller-ETOP03</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:&#39;EverQuest@yahoogroups.com&#39;\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">&#39;EverQuest@yahoogroups.com&#39;</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, August 08, 2001 1:13 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] New EQ Player</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>Rico,<br><br>I have a 38 dwarf cleric on The \n  Nameless.&nbsp; A few tips:<br><br>1) Max wisdom - not all subscribe to this, \n  but you have an inate strength already as a dwarf.&nbsp; I put my other points \n  to bring up either dex or agility, whichever lower<br>2) Find a regular \n  partner to help you to level at the low levels - you can solo first few \n  levels, but I found grouping with one other PC helped<br>3) As a cleric, go to \n  Kurn&#39;s tower around level ten - lots of undead to nuke on when alone and \n  clerics were always welcome in groups there<br><br>Use the other yahoogroups \n  specifically for clerics for more help and advice: EQ_Cleric@yahoogroups.com \n  and EQ-Clerics@yahoogroups.com - Some of the folks there are quite, er, vocal \n  and opinionated, hehe.&nbsp; But we all know that Dwarves make the best \n  clerics - you picked the right race.<br><br>Use Caster&#39;s Realm and Rayne&#39;s \n  cleric site for cleric reference information.&nbsp; Also Allakhazam&#39;s for a \n  lot of general information.<br><br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a><br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/\">http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/</a><br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</a><br><br>Good \n  luck,<br><br>Robiinton<br>Dwarf Cleric of 38 Heals<br>Piemur \n  Draggonsinger<br>Woodelf Bard of 42 Songs<br>Message: 16<br>Unity of \n  Spirits<br>The Nameless<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Date: Wed, 08 Aug 2001 01:43:41 \n  -0000<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From: &quot;Rico&quot; &lt;sage422@...&gt;<br>Subject: New \n  EQ player<br><br>Hey guys,<br><br>I know I&#39;m about 2 years late but better \n  late than never.&nbsp; I am on <br>Ayonae Ro and just made a dwarf \n  cleric.&nbsp; Any little tips and advice <br>thrown my way will be very \n  appreciated.&nbsp; Beside saving up fo rmy <br>spell, I bought the book, \n  should I invest next for my armor? weapon? <br>or misc items such as \n  rings?&nbsp; Thanks again.<br><br>Rico&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <br></tt><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
