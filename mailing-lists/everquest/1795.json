I&#39;ve got a lumberjack&#39;s cap, splitpaw gloves, and a<br/>\n&gt; brown chitin protector right now, but everything else is leather armor.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve also got a black enameled mace.  What sort of upgrades would make the<br/>\n&gt; most sense right now?  Is there a piece or two of armor that I can&#39;t live<br/>\n&gt; without?  I can&#39;t afford anything in the thousands, but I could swing a<br/>\n&gt; couple hundred plats or a bit more for a good piece of armor.  I know it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; been said that I won&#39;t melee much after lvl 20, but I still want to keep up<br/>\n&gt; my battle skills.  Besides, I mostly solo and enjoy banging on something<br/>\n&gt; every once in a while when its hps have gotten low.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m on Terris Thule, by the way :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
