We created our<br/>\ncharacters at the same time, we&#39;re both Wood Elf Druids.  We<br/>\ndistributed our extra 30 stat points the same.  We group most of the<br/>\ntime so level just about the same time.  We even have the same AC and<br/>\nHP within a couple of points.  We&#39;ve been keeping track of our<br/>\nnumerical stats/skills and he&#39;s actually a bit *better* than I am in<br/>\nmost abilities, including 1H blunt and most spell casting.  However -<br/>\nhe gets the snot beat out of him all the time.  He &quot;misses&quot; a *LOT*,<br/>\neven when I&#39;m fighting something and he&#39;s come up behind it.  When he<br/>\ndoes hit he hits for 6 and 7 points avg, where I avg. 10 or 11...  The<br/>\nonly *real* difference between his character and mine is the<br/>\ngender..... Any ideas *what* the deal is?  Oh, other things we&#39;ve<br/>\nchecked:  Weight allowance - carrying minimal amount.  Carrying<br/>\nsomething detrimental - nothing that I can see.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery confused, <br/>\nLliani, 6th level Druid of Kelethin, Karana server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
