I keep<br/>\n&gt; looking for strategies for each character all over the Web, but one thing<br/>\n&gt; eludes me. Of course, that&#39;s making platinum. I keep seeing all these<br/>\nbooks<br/>\n&gt; for sale on how to make platinum easily and quickly, but I keep writing<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; off as scams. Are there any half-decent methods for growing wealthier?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
