Also, buff him up with strength so he can<br/>\n&gt; deal more damage.  I&#39;m really not sure if fearing is very effective<br/>\n&gt; to PL because when I tried doing that, they didn&#39;t seem to get much<br/>\n&gt; xp out of it.  Well, I can definitely help your hubby get to your<br/>\n&gt; level if you&#39;re on Vazaelle.  I doubt it though.  Not many poeple<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen online post that they&#39;re on vazaelle.  Cuz I can definitely<br/>\n&gt; help him level.  I&#39;m a level 51 druid and I can use my 49 DS and<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;ll kill mobs like they were nothing.  It deals 24 points of damage<br/>\n&gt; each time the mob hits the person with the DS.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Laura Buskirk&quot; &lt;wolffe@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was wondering if some of you could help me.  I got my hubby<br/>\n&gt; involved in EQ<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so he&#39;d stop bugging me to get off the computer.  He&#39;s got a 10th<br/>\n&gt; lvl<br/>\n&gt; &gt; halfling fighter, and I know next to nothing about the melee<br/>\n&gt; classes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Assuming he&#39;s got about 1000pp to spend, what are his best choices<br/>\n&gt; for armor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and a decent weapon.  He&#39;s got a fine steel longsword right now,<br/>\n&gt; which seems<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to suck, and leather armor.  Should he go to bronze or fine steel<br/>\n&gt; armor?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What does a full suit of either of these cost?  And what&#39;s the best<br/>\n&gt; weapon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for him at this point?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, I&#39;m trying to powerlevel him just a little so we can go<br/>\n&gt; adventuring<br/>\n&gt; &gt; together, though I&#39;m not generally a fan of leveling people that<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what they&#39;re doing.  They should die plenty and learn like the rest<br/>\n&gt; of us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; did :P  I have a 16 druid and he just needs a couple of levels so<br/>\n&gt; we can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hang out.  Is there a good place to do this quickly?  All I can<br/>\n&gt; think of at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the moment is to fear kite lions and bears, oh my, and let him hack<br/>\n&gt; them up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There&#39;s so darn many people in EC these days, though.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for any help!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Laura<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
