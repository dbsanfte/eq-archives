Just got back in a couple days ago. My<br/>\n&gt; Halfling Druid lvl 42 returned to Rivervale, and I got this whispered<br/>\n&gt; message to meet a NPC. I had seen the message before, but since I had<br/>\n&gt; nothing else going on, I responded. As a result I went searching for a<br/>\n&gt; camp of adventurers. I talked to whom I had been directed to, and was<br/>\n&gt; encouraged to go on missions for them. However, I haven&#39;t found anyone<br/>\n&gt; in the camp in Butcherblock nor the camp in East Commonlands who will<br/>\n&gt; give me a mission. Anyone know about this Adventure business, or some<br/>\n&gt; place I can look?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, it was sure interesting spending the night in East Commonlands. It<br/>\n&gt; used to be lowbee heaven, but I found myself actually fighting for my<br/>\n&gt; life and wondering if I might actually have to run. It was rather fun.<br/>\n&gt; A positive change.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; 42nd season Halfling Druid. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
