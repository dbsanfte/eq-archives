I am looking for a kind soul that <br/>\nhas extra time, and willing to aid fellow adventurers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have problem patching the huge files.. mainly eqgame.exe <br/>\neqfeartintro.pak nedaria.s3d etc etc<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, using eq own default patch program, those files took ages.. <br/>\nand if I somehow manage to get the files I needed posted on a <br/>\nwebsite.. it will help me a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to quit 3 years ago, when Warrens and Stoneburnt (those <br/>\noptional download zones) came out and I cant download it..<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend used to help me by sending emails containing particular big <br/>\nfiles (over 1mb gives me problems, as my isp somehow limit/time my <br/>\nd/l if it took too long/over 1mb files) and somehow I manage to <br/>\nfinished patching.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not on a 56k modem, but using a CDMA phone connection that <br/>\nsupposedly have 260k speed (but honestly the max I ever got was 80k, <br/>\ntwice the speed of dial up).. and if I dont use software like <br/>\ndownload accelerator, then files will be downloaded at such a <br/>\nhorrible speed that 1mb will took 10 hours, but if using those 3rd <br/>\nparty software to somehow &quot;trick&quot; my isp insane firewall.. then I <br/>\ncan easily d/l 4mb-10mb per hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.. what I am asking for help is.. please, could anybody be as so <br/>\nkind as to post/upload to a free website the eqfeartintros.pak which <br/>\nserver shows as 1377409 big and ldonequip.s3d server 1133942. I have <br/>\nmany more files I had not manage to d/l. But once I manage to d/l <br/>\nthese 2 files, 3mb big which will take me upmost of 2 hours with d/l <br/>\nexpress (best booster soft!).. then I will update these kind folks, <br/>\nthanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologise if im hard to understand.. yep, im in my confused and <br/>\nweakened state as it has taken me 3days of phonecalls, browsing net <br/>\nto find solution (mess with MTU, ping, tracert, sent sony countless <br/>\npatch server date, and it somehows shows sonyonline.net should share <br/>\nthe problems too).. so sorry and please accept my thanks if anyone <br/>\ncan help. Thank You (I would gladly pass a Velious keycode)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
