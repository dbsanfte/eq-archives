I will be needing Brute hides, and so was ready to go and hunt <br/>\n&gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never met the boat. I <br/>\n&gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and they went out to <br/>\n&gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the boat left. The <br/>\n&gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick off gnolls, and <br/>\n&gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool box full of them. <br/>\n&gt; have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there until I get the <br/>\n&gt; rest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls, which I have <br/>\n&gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I want to do it the <br/>\n&gt; old-fashioned way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
