That&#39;ll<br/>\nbe your main aggro drawing spell (along with Terror/Fear-in the upper 50s).<br/>\nWhen shopping for items remember that your main job is to tank, take all the<br/>\nhits for the group so if a wep has anything with STA/AC/HP on it use those.<br/>\nFor the weapon you mentioned what kind of stats does it have?  <br/>\nThe stats will determine if you should use that over something with high dmg<br/>\nand no stats.  Like I said earlier the main ones you should focus on are<br/>\nSTA/AC/HP and STR/DEX to a lesser degree, anyone with WIS and CHA is pretty<br/>\nmuch useless to this class.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuke Bloodbrood Deathdisciple &lt;Caelitus&gt;<br/>\nShadowknight of Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: lisa b [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lisab38@...\">lisab38@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 09, 2005 11:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] SK Help ????<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello All:<br/>\nI started an alt SK and wanted to know what is a good focus effect for them <br/>\nif that makes sense.  They don&#39;t seem to have any Direct Damage spells that <br/>\nI could see on the spell list so that is out.<br/>\nAlso, having a hard time finding a decent weapon for my SK.  I have one now <br/>\nthat does 28 damage with no stats--should I go for lower damage and more <br/>\nstats or stay with high damage and no stats. lololol.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeath!!!
