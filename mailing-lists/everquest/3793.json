The most I&#39;ve looted off a HG at one time is<br/>\n41pp, the least is a few gold. Usually it&#39;s pp somewhere in between.<br/>\nEveryone I know at all levels above 30 go to Rathe specifically for cash...<br/>\nXp is good if you are a lower level (I have a 29 Troll SK)but cash is the<br/>\nbest I&#39;ve seen so far. Speaking of Unrest, my guild (Fire and Brimstone,<br/>\nAyonae Ro) is doing a raid on Unrest this Saturday, should be fun I need to<br/>\nreplace the Bloodstained Mantle I lost in a bad trade awhile back... They<br/>\nare doing a raid on Mistmoore tonight, but I can&#39;t loose faction with the<br/>\nIndigo Brotherhood since I do all my business in Neriak....<br/>\n  Anyway, my 2cp on makin money... I checked out the guides too, I&#39;ll keep<br/>\ndoin what I&#39;ve been doin....<br/>\n<br/>\n Steven Hulse wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for posting this. I went to check them out and you know I have to<br/>\nsay I was a little dissapointed in the guides. A lot of the information that<br/>\nthey contain can be found at almost any EQ related website! It&#39;s basically<br/>\nthat I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay for any of these guides, it&#39;s really not worth<br/>\nthe money. The only thing I&#39;m truly interested in is making money. Man it<br/>\nsucks trying to get some decent armor when you have no money. I&#39;ve wondered<br/>\nabout the &quot;make Plat at any level&quot; guides and I figured that you would still<br/>\nneed to group or partner at some point. <br/>\n<br/>\nEither way I&#39;m having fun just going along and doing things the old<br/>\nfashioned way. I do suggest going and getting these guides because there<br/>\nwere a few things in there that was nice to know about but for any player,<br/>\nespecially noobs, I suggest doing it the old fashioned way and go out there<br/>\nand take the lumps and partner with some others. It&#39;s funner and you&#39;ll feel<br/>\nbetter knowing that you did it on your own. <br/>\n<br/>\nI got some good info about Unrest so I think I may go and try it out this<br/>\nweek. <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
