(and the<br/>\nmodels I turned on were all hideous, didn&#39;t like the<br/>\nDwarf or Halfling models at all, it&#39;s embarassing to<br/>\nthink I look like that to some people) Of course, I<br/>\nprobably wouldn&#39;t be quite as soured on it if it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t for all the bad bugs and lengthy downtime right<br/>\nin the middle of my usual play time. (generally play<br/>\nfrom 2am til 6am PST, downtime was always 3am-6am) I<br/>\ncertainly appreciate Kunark a lot more post-Luclin<br/>\nthough. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or find a kind druid or wizzy who will do it for<br/>\n&gt; free or small donation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>10pp is a small donation. :) But yeah, that was<br/>\nessentially what I was suggesting. I always made a<br/>\npoint of scrounging up the 10pp selling crushbone<br/>\nbelts when I wanted to go somewhere, and most druids<br/>\nrefused it, felt appropriate to offer though. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nWeb-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
