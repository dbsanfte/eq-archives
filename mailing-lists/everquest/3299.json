We registered our own domain,<br/>\nasked members who cared for a contribution and it wasnt a problem. We<br/>\ndeveloped a raid system, its fairly nice now, its like an automated workflow<br/>\nsystem. You log in , go to the raid attendance page, sign for the<br/>\nappropriate raid, mark which mobs you killed, and how many hours you played.<br/>\nThe system then automatically updates your raidpoints online and deducts<br/>\npoints if you gained loot. A message is sent to raidleader with a raid<br/>\nattendance summary and here changes can be made, points added or deducted if<br/>\nthere are errors or inconsistensies. 5 days after finished raid the raid is<br/>\nclosed and archived. Old raids , mobs are searchable and loot history is<br/>\nsortable on who got what and when. Its...nice. You see your % raid<br/>\nattendance / month and class to see whos slacking and what classes you need<br/>\nmore of to keep raiding smooth. You see the total amounts of raids you could<br/>\nhave attended since you joined raid and how many you actually were there<br/>\nfor. Guild average level is calculated, aswell as there are flags on the<br/>\naccounts for special things like who is officer, what keys you hold, if you<br/>\nare afk, if account should be hidden when rendering member table cause of<br/>\nlow attendance, links to magelo profiles, mail address, contact info.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimply, a lot of work put into a solid system for an online community. These<br/>\nkind of things I would imagine the legends service would offer (without<br/>\nchecking). This is something VI should offer to all, it makes larger guilds<br/>\na lot easier to manage and give you time to do what you want, play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rob LeBeau [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">rlebeau65@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 22, 2002 4:15 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EverQuest] Digest Number 531<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\noooooo A very good point.  This sounds like a good<br/>\nidea but you are actually saying another real account<br/>\nfor just baking?

I do agree very much that you shall keep your<br/>\n&gt; account safe and all<br/>\n&gt; this, but in a large scale operations guild its<br/>\n&gt; IMPOSSIBLE to not share your<br/>\n&gt; account with a few people that you trust. This is<br/>\n&gt; essential to day to day<br/>\n&gt; operations. You choose a couple of people who you<br/>\n&gt; trust and hand them your<br/>\n&gt; info.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1 example. Guild property and funding. A single<br/>\n&gt; person cannot manage the<br/>\n&gt; trades/funds/hand out of items for the guild. This<br/>\n&gt; would be a full time job<br/>\n&gt; for 1 person in my guild. Our solution is a separate<br/>\n&gt; account shared among<br/>\n&gt; the officers with mules for cash / gems / spells /<br/>\n&gt; items. On our<br/>\n&gt; messageboard transactions take place and a member<br/>\n&gt; can ask any officer to<br/>\n&gt; complete a transaction once its validated on board.<br/>\n&gt; This is clearly against<br/>\n&gt; the EULA but since there are no support for these<br/>\n&gt; types of operations with a<br/>\n&gt; central store for a guild we have not found a better<br/>\n&gt; way to handle work like<br/>\n&gt; this. How do others solve these types of problems?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, July 19, 2002 5:32 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Digest Number 531<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, any exchange of accounts is forbidden by the<br/>\n&gt; terms of service. Part of<br/>\n&gt; the reason for this is that the person buying the<br/>\n&gt; account may get swindled.<br/>\n&gt; They may pay for the account only to find that the<br/>\n&gt; character is deleted or<br/>\n&gt; the person changes passwords on them and so forth.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard of this<br/>\n&gt; happening. Or they may get an account that has many<br/>\n&gt; soulmarks for bad<br/>\n&gt; behavior. Also, people who work for Verant and EQ<br/>\n&gt; have been invited to this<br/>\n&gt; list. If they see the people advertising they are<br/>\n&gt; selling their accounts<br/>\n&gt; here, they may bust the person who is trying to sell<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since he is selling his account for Platnum (15k,<br/>\n&gt; which I don&#39;t have) is<br/>\n&gt; that against the rules?
