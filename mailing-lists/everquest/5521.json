I find a bridge in<br/>\nthe Plane of Knowledge (no monsters) and figure out how high I need to fall<br/>\nfrom to take damage, but as little damage as possible.  I drop an item on<br/>\nthat spot, shruiken usually, so that I know where to jump off at when I run<br/>\nback up.  A while of that and I stop taking damage from that level and move<br/>\nthe item up the bridge.  I don&#39;t usually have to fall to many times to make<br/>\nit raise a point.  There is a max you can raise a skill to, so once you hit<br/>\nthe max you will never gain more points until you go to another level.  I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s 5x level +10 so at 9 max is 55, but I could be wrong.  This may<br/>\nbe why you can not raise it now.  I would never spend points on Safe Fall, I<br/>\nput all my points in Mend.  I find Mend to helpful to waste just to train,<br/>\nunless you are just training and not facing any real dangers.  All my<br/>\nfighting and defense skills tend to max out from fighting so I see no reason<br/>\nto add to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n[SNIP]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; As a monk, how do I improve my safe fall skill without spending all<br/>\n&gt; my points on it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I keep jumping off tall things and taking damage but no improvement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why are all the characters white?  What if I want to play a black<br/>\n&gt; person?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
