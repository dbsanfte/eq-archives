I now have a level 40 Vah Shir shaman that rocks. I have damage over time spells that can do around 2000 pts in damage in just under 2 minutes,&nbsp; Plus a pet who can do the rest of the damage while the dot&#39;s are doing their work.&nbsp; Like Orion said,&nbsp; I have SOW, plus buffs that enhance all melee stats.&nbsp; With the click of a button, I can give my whole group SOW with an attack bonus on it. I also have a spell that does the same with Strength.&nbsp; I can increase your Agility, Dex, Stamina all by 30.&nbsp; by the time I get to 60 I will have a spell that increases those stats by 120 AND your attack by 120.&nbsp; I have buffs that increase your HP and AC although they are not as powerful as a clerics, combined with the stat buffs they more than make up.&nbsp; I also have stat debuffing spells that can slow a mob,&nbsp; decrease strength, and decrease their resists so that a wizard or any other spellcasting class can nuke the mob.&nbsp; There are also a few nukes a shaman can get although not as powerful as a wizard.&nbsp; We can also act as back up healers if the cleric is OOM or getting hit.&nbsp; Overall,&nbsp; I think that the shaman is one of the best balanced classes and a great class to start with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the mid range armor (totemic) IS a might difficult to get =D&nbsp; (finally just got my totemic BP)&nbsp; I would suggest starting either a vah shir,&nbsp; or barbarian as they can go more places without being killed everywhere they go.&nbsp; As a vah shir,&nbsp; I am KOS to very few places =D&nbsp; Sorry about the soapbox,&nbsp; but I love my Shaman.&nbsp; I also forgot to add that at 25 (you&#39;re better off starting at 30) you get alchemy..&nbsp; you can make potions that you can sell to other players like SOW, &amp; invis vs undead which can be quite handy...&nbsp; Oh,&nbsp; Shamans also have the ability to gate.\n<p>Katashaka Naboombu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40 Shaman and future grandmaster alchemist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vazaelle&nbsp; Proud Member of Champions of War\n<p>&nbsp;\n<p>&nbsp; <b><i>Orion &lt;orionv@...&gt;</i></b> wrote: \n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;\">\n \n<style></style>\n\n<div><strong><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">I think everyone is forgetting a really great one.
