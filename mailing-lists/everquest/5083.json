As it is I have failed 4 or 5 times because of<br/>\nrunning out of time.<br/>\nThe first dungeon crawl I did we made over 100pp each. Second one I got a<br/>\nwisdom augmentation stone. Even though we didn&#39;t succeed we still had fun.<br/>\nI hope that I can get grouped with some guildies sometime though.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I have been in a couple of guild adventures.  It&#39;s not too hard to<br/>\n&gt; get 6 guildies together, but not all the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And the main idea of all these adventures is to get to the named mob,<br/>\n&gt; because that is where the big drop is.  Rangers and Druids have<br/>\n&gt; track, so once again we have a use.  And that snare helps too when<br/>\n&gt; they go for friends!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n&gt; Pathfinder of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Summoners of the Realm, Terris-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Lyles&quot; &lt;dwlyles@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a level 41 Half Elf Druid.  Like you, I have soloed most of my<br/>\n&gt; life.  What I have found about LDoN is, true you have to group.  But<br/>\n&gt; the organization is there, so that the groups constantly change.<br/>\n&gt; Most often I am asked to join by putting my LFG flag up.  The<br/>\n&gt; adventures are short, 2 hrs and have a specific goal to obtain.  The<br/>\n&gt; exp is great, typically half a level per adventure.  We druids are<br/>\n&gt; popular for our regen buff and healing, and have counteract poison up<br/>\n&gt; if someone&#39;s gonna play with the crates.  You can save yourself in<br/>\n&gt; time if your fast.  Then, after 2 hrs, you split the loot, typically<br/>\n&gt; 50 - 80 plat your share, and go back to soloing.  I thought it was<br/>\n&gt; more for guilds as well, but have yet to see a group of all one<br/>\n&gt; guild.  I am typically quiet (I type slow, hehe) but so much goes on<br/>\n&gt; so fast, that nobody seems to mind.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tokool Espirit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lany&#39;s server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: mlockridge01<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2003 1:03 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Hello All<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I am a lvl 41 Halfling Druid.
