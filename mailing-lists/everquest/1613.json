If you know how much money some people have made on just ebaying legit loot then you can figure out how much they can make from spreading a simple EQ virus to gain access to hundreds of accounts(I&#39;ve had one guildmate this year that had a virus like that, she ended up being banned).. They get your account info, ebay all tradable loot then they sell the account itself.. Unfortunately the buyer is screwed since the real owner will report the theft most likely..
