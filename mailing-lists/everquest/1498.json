It was highly<br/>\nrecommeneded from the EQ boards (before it became moderated).  I called <br/>\nthem up and asked for specific details on the motherboard, chips, etc, then<br/>\nsearched the web on these parts and found they were all highly rated. <br/>\nThe vid card is a GeForce made especially for them by Nvidia, so there&#39;s<br/>\nno brand name (creative, gulliomont, ect) to it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe system I got was a 1.2 Ghz T-Bird, with all the trimmings.  My previous<br/>\nsystem was a AMD 300, with a 16meg TNT Card. :)  Played for almost 2 years<br/>\non that system.  Needed to upgrade when we started to hunt deeper into<br/>\nKunark.  I was playing a cleric at the time and I was lagging in the <br/>\ntiming for heals.  That is NOT a good thing.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, i&#39;m very happy with the system.  I loaded every high perf game I<br/>\ncan get my hands on, and it hasn&#39;t missed a beat.  Oh, and the most important<br/>\nthing is that it hasn&#39;t crashed once in EQ (Old world, kunark, velious). Runs<br/>\nsmoooooth as silk with all settings MAXED (clipping, particles, resolution, etc).<br/>\nThe best part is that it runs all the games with out problems straight out<br/>\nof the box! Just plug it in, load it up, and go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne caveat, when you order the system, it takes about 3-4 weeks to get to you. <br/>\nI ordered mine a week before xmas, and didn&#39;t get it until mid januaray.  If<br/>\nyou got patients, its well worth it.  If not, grab the list of parts they use<br/>\nand build your own or find a local shop that can custom build it for ya. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, good luck.  I plan on purchasing another one from them for my GF. <br/>\nShe uses a pent3 -650, asus mb, asus geforce 2 64m card, and EQ crashes way <br/>\ntoo often on her system.  I&#39;ve tried everything to get her system stable, <br/>\nbut to no avail.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Knight<br/>\n<br/>\n-Cleric (Main), Shadowknight, Necro, Droood<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, May 25, 2001 at 02:29:07PM -0200, Nygaardr, FC3 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I will be buying a computer in a few months and am wondering what some of<br/>\n&gt; you people use to play EQ.
