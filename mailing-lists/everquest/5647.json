Recently they decided to change the engine to<br/>\n&gt; Direct X9 for some reason.  The end result so far<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;ve seen is lag, delays in computer responding<br/>\n&gt; to casting or pulling, LDs, some people falling<br/>\n&gt; through the earth and ending up in mid-space, even<br/>\n&gt; dying as a result of falling through.  Have no idea<br/>\n&gt; why this is happening so often, but my guild leader<br/>\n&gt; cant hardly play anymore since he tends to LD just<br/>\n&gt; crossing a zone (has even fallen through the earth<br/>\n&gt; and died one time.)  Not sure when they will finally<br/>\n&gt; get it ironed out, but hope its soon.<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Melanie Johnson <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, March 29, 2004 12:52 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: Very slow after<br/>\n&gt; DirectX 9 patch<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ve not been playing for a while now, but this<br/>\n&gt; has made me curious.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I upgraded to DX9 last summer so I could play SWG.<br/>\n&gt; Then I started playing EQ again last fall, still<br/>\n&gt; using DX9.
