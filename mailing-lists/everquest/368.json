I tried again and I waited, maybe the game was loading something<br/>\nbut nothing, all movement in the screen stops and the game hangs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I change the resolution? I would like to achieve 800x600.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaryoon<br/>\nLvl 2 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
