I find <br/>\nthe style of game play is quite different in each medium.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately the consoles prove the easiest and least expensive to buy <br/>\nand upgrade. Generally a console and two games, maybe a few more <br/>\nitems, can be had for $300.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to put a decent pc together for gaming for under $1000. <br/>\nAbout double that will net a decent machine with upgrade potential, <br/>\nbut without the need to upgrade for some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe upper end of pc gaming runs around $8000. <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, more people can buy in for $300 than for the $1000 plus.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of me wants to be a pc hotrodder, and build an ubermachine. Big, <br/>\nbad, and hot. With adequate cooling, as well. That part of me does <br/>\nnot have access to the purse. Sadly, real life expenses have first <br/>\nclaim on my wallet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I am watching the trends, and encouraging myself to adopt the <br/>\nphilosophy that I am a gamer, and the platform is less important than <br/>\nthe experience. It is within the scope of possibility, and probably <br/>\nin the path of great profitability for the makers, that console <br/>\nonline multiplayer games will be of such game quality in the future <br/>\nthat holding onto the pc platform will be only an option, and not a <br/>\nnecessity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternately, I can see online game manufacturers selling systems to <br/>\ninsure their audience is there. Wouldn&#39;t that be grand? Order the <br/>\ngame and the system all for one monthly payment. Upgrade components <br/>\nwill be shipped when software demands require it. Your system will <br/>\nalways be current.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will the future hold? I don&#39;t know, but I am sure I cannot be <br/>\nshelling out several thousand dollars every other year. The cost has <br/>\nto be brought in line with the spending capacity of a large audience, <br/>\nor else the hobby will suffer decline.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
