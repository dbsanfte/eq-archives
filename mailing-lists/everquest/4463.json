A lot of people like this can not handle someone disagreeing with them, and they simply don&#39;t want anything to do with that - maybe this was TC&#39;s problem, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this is not to say that they are the majority - not at all!  And I agree with whomever said that the reason we join groups like this, is to learn more about the game!  I know that&#39;s why I have joined...along with the chance to just chat with other EQ-heads, LOL  :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw nothing offensive, mean, or ill-natured in the dino/aggro posts whatsoever!  I simply saw everyone stating their own pro&#39;s and con&#39;s for them, flat out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow...just thought I&#39;d put in my two cents worth on this, LOL.  I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nBela<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nBela<br/>\n<br/>\n~*~Is all that we see or seem, but a dream within a dream?~*~<br/>\n                   ~*~Edgar Allen Poe~*~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
