I have <br/>\nbeen playing EQ since the beginning, and have a vast knowledge of the <br/>\ngame. I current have 3 characters, a 65 Ranger, a 48 Necro, and a 44 <br/>\nRogue. I have, however, played every class into the 30&#39;s, just to get <br/>\na feel for how each class works. Please feel free to ask me any <br/>\nquestions =) I check the boards once every three days, and will try <br/>\nto answer any questions I can =)<br/>\n<br/>\nRhemy DeMortis<br/>\n65 Forest Stalker of Tunare<br/>\nOfficer and Proud member of Haven&#39;s Promise<br/>\nMith Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
