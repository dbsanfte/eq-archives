I&#39;ve got pretty crappy \n8 28 and 11&nbsp;29 delay weapons and I can still do a lot of damage just by \nfighting. I still think that the damage spells are useful for bringing \nsomething&nbsp;down faster when&nbsp;a lot of mobs show up, the ranger&nbsp;can \nhelp take a spellcaster&nbsp;down really fast when they want to. I have been \nfinding that lately I just use my mana for snares and buffs.&nbsp;I guess at \nlevel 49 you get a 200hp nuke that has a long recast time, at 59 you get a 450hp \nnuke with a&nbsp;long recast time. It is obvious that rangers&nbsp;werent \ndesigned to chain nuke, they even gave us spells that would discourage us from \ndoing&nbsp;that, and just wade in with our weapons, and nuke&nbsp;when something \nneeds to die a little faster. The wizard of course is the&nbsp;best character at \nbringing mobs down&nbsp;immediately. </font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"bigmaca3@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmaca3@...\">bigmaca3</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Friday, April 05, 2002 3:52 \nPM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Re: Hi, I am \n  new</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>Actually, spells are a small part of a Rangers damage \n  output.&nbsp; You <br>should be looking for 20-24 delay weapons now and just \n  dual wield <br>them to death.&nbsp; There are several good Ranger sites around \n  that give <br>you the low down on playing an effective Ranger.&nbsp; Most \n  groups want a <br>SoW&#39;er and a Snare&#39;er!&nbsp; I&#39;ll look them up and post one \n  for you.<br><br>As for armor, banded is ok, but you should be starting your \n  Ivy <br>Etched quests or looking into Ry&#39;Gorr.&nbsp; Weight is the killer for \n  most <br>Rangers and all those armors help.&nbsp; And get you Short Sword of \n  <br>Morin.&nbsp; You should be able to handle the Ghoul Messenger in WK.&nbsp; \n  Make <br>us proud!<br><br>--- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;J.

Rangers are the <br>best outdoor pullers. At 30 I have found that I can \n  still be a main <br>tank. I concentrate soley on AC. Riftwind&#39;s protection is \n  a great <br>spell that really helps your AC. I like being a ranger because, \n  they <br>are surprisingly effective at helping out in bad situations. Of \n  <br>course, the wizard and enchanter are the best at putting down a bad \n  <br>situation, but the ranger isn&#39;t that bad either. If you have a full \n  <br>bar of mana and a decent wis, you can cast your 37hp nuke like twenty \n  <br>times. I guess I am saying that Rangers have some control over how \n  <br>much damage they deal, whereas the other tanks just do consistent \n  <br>damage. If a ranger wants something to die faster they can do that \n  <br>which is helpful in a group and something most people and rangers I \n  <br>played with dont realize. I understand that as you get older you have \n  <br>to be more aware about not drawing agro. I read a post somewhere that \n  <br>says a ranger needs to keep their AC at 20 times their level. I am at \n  <br>level 30 and with Riftwinds Protection and the new thornskin buff, my \n  <br>AC is exactly 600. I don&#39;t know how I am going to get the money to <br>get \n  it any higher. I am still mostly in banded though, so I guess it <br>shouldn&#39;t \n  be that hard. I will try to make some friends to play with, <br>but I have \n  always had a hard time with that for some reason, maybe I <br>should try the \n  friends command.&nbsp; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Group skills are probably the most \n  important thing you can have in <br>the game.&nbsp; As a Ranger you are \n  sometimes asked to pull, and you need <br>to know how to do that.&nbsp; \n  Otherwise you&#39;re a backup to the tank.&nbsp; The <br>roles change several \n  times during the game as you progress in <br>levels.&nbsp; Now I feel how \n  poorly Rangers tank when the Mob puts the <br>smack down on me!&nbsp; Maybe I \n  should change my name to Manasponge!
