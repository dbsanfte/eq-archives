You mentioned having Camouflage memmed, which, while a good<br/>\nidea while travelling in any dangerous zone, can lull you into a false sense<br/>\nof security in FM (Dreadlands too). I say that because the Mountain Giants<br/>\nare not fooled by Camo, or Invis -- they see right through it, and would not<br/>\nbe a good chance meeting for a level 29 druid travelling alone. I think some<br/>\nof the Goblin Casters and perhaps the Burynai Cenobites can also see through<br/>\nCamo/Invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor, Wood Elf Druid of 41 seasons<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
