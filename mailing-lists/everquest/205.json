I<br/>\ndecided early on to use dual hammers as weapons this<br/>\nseems to work out well my stats are ( Or close to) DW<br/>\n38 OF 27 Def 28 HTH 12 Kick 17. So here are my<br/>\nquestions. One should I give up on the Hammers and<br/>\njust use my fists ( They seem to do simular damage I<br/>\njust like the Hammers) Or should I keep using the<br/>\nhammers or switch to another weapon. Also I have been<br/>\nlooking for hammers better than rusty but cant find<br/>\nany to purchase and dont know where to look. I have<br/>\nasked around but to no avail. One more question, where<br/>\nnear freeport should I be adventuring to find better<br/>\nstuff. I have tried the bandits but they kill me quick<br/>\nand whoever I am with. The Fire Bugs and Armidillas<br/>\nare the only mobs that still give exp. Every once in a<br/>\nwhile I can take out a puma or jackal when I can find<br/>\nthem. I am a half a bubble away from 6 so my guess is<br/>\nthat the Fire Bugs and armmildillas wont be providing<br/>\nexp much longer. Also has anyone ever looted anything<br/>\nfrom an armidilla? Well any other words of advice<br/>\nwould be greatly appreciated.<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
