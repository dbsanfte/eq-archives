Check out it out and let me know what ya&#39;ll think!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo need to claim to view the spells when you read the exact spell from the<br/>\nspell dat file.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQCaster (http://www.eqcaster.com) is a program that lists every spell in<br/>\nthe Everquest world, including procs on weapons. The procs is something that<br/>\nwould not be listed on castersrelm. Every spell is on your hard drive in<br/>\nyour EverQuest folder named spdat.eff. The EQCaster program reads this file<br/>\nand lists all the information. Like for instance the weapon Wavecrasher. It<br/>\nhas a effect on the weapon called Breath of the Sea. I do not think any<br/>\nclass has this spell. Looking at the spell information, the proc does the<br/>\nfollowing:<br/>\n<br/>\nEffects:<br/>\nDecrease Attack speed by 20%<br/>\nDecrease Hit Points (HP) by 20 per tick over 10 ticks<br/>\nTarget: PC/NPC Targeted <br/>\nDuration: 10 ticks (1 minute) <br/>\nCasting Time: 0 second <br/>\nRecovery Time: 15 seconds <br/>\nRecasting Time: 0 second <br/>\nResistance Check: Magic <br/>\nRange: 200.0 feet <br/>\nMessage when someone cast on you: You are slowed by the mist of the seas. <br/>\nMessage when someone cast on other: Aradune is slowed by the mist of the<br/>\nseas. <br/>\nMessage when spell fades: The mist melts away.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, this weapon will proc a 20% slow plus a 200 hit point damage over time.<br/>\nThe DOT information tells me that it is going to do 20 HP of damage every 6<br/>\nseconds, for 60 seconds. This data also tells me that this weapon proc is<br/>\nchecked against the NPC/PC magic resistance. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpell reading programs are very helpful and can give you a lot of valuable<br/>\ninformation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do not feel like downloading a program, you can also go to some web<br/>\nsites that host this type of program and browse for a spell or proc. One<br/>\ngood web site is the Night Watchers guild from 7th Hammer<br/>\n(http://nightwatchers.dpn.ch/ &lt;http://nightwatchers.dpn.ch/&gt;  ) Go to the<br/>\ntool bar of the left and down at the bottom you can search for an item or<br/>\nspell. Click on Search under Equipment and in the new page type in the<br/>\nweapon, armor, potion, bag, food or drink or whatever is in the entire game<br/>\nof EverQuest. If you just put the word boot into the search, it will give<br/>\nyou the results of EVERYTHING the has the word boot in the item. With 10<br/>\npages of results you can then click on any of the items with the word boots<br/>\nin them. After you click on any of these boots, you see all the stats for<br/>\nthis boot. I clicked on the Akkirus&#39; Boots of the Risen. Every item in EQ<br/>\nhas an item number. Akkirus&#39; Boots of the Risen is item number 31146.<br/>\nAkkirus&#39; Boots of the Risen also has an effect, Abundant Drink. You can<br/>\nclick on this Effect and the new page will display the effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a very awesome web page, check it out. It is cool to see all the new<br/>\nitems coming into the game and wonder what this effect does and then able to<br/>\nclick the effect and know exactly what it does.<br/>\n<br/>\nSistily<br/>\nGnome Warlady<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tKAZ [SMTP:kazvorpal@...]<br/>\n\tSent:\tWednesday, February 20, 2002 9:42 AM<br/>\n\tTo:\teqrangers@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n\tSubject:\t[eqrangers] New Spells...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt;    From: &quot;Hayhurst, Alan R&quot; &lt;alan.hayhurst@...&gt;<br/>\n\t&gt; Subject: RE: Digest Number 1780<br/>\n\t&gt; <br/>\n\t&gt; I think I was referring to my new level 39 spells, nothing more.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry if<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; I<br/>\n\t&gt; confused you.
