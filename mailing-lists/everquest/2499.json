Help is great<br/>\n&gt; and i really do appreciate it but i also want to<br/>\n&gt; feel<br/>\n&gt; like i have accomplished something personally...Does<br/>\n&gt; that make sense...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Evercurious,<br/>\n&gt;  Naara<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
