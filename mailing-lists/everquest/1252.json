As a druid, I sometimes have to heal, sometimes nuke, sometimes damage shield and DOT, but rarely, if ever, melee. So I run into the same problem of not being near the corpse when it dies and the group you&#39;re with is FFA. I really don&#39;t mind free for all loot, provided that everyone understands no one needs to get greedy. By the sound of it, you were hunting in Highkeep, a personal favorite of mine. Most groups that are not ffa usually go alphabetically and you keep looting until you get a total of 2pp, a bronze or FS weapon or armor, or some combination of ore (down in the warrior and raider rooms).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think any looting order is any better than others. I think it completely depends on the people you&#39;re grouped with. Some people can do the ffa loot and no one ever loots too much and it works smoothly. And in the alpha loot, as long as everyone&#39;s honest, that works well too.<br/>\n<br/>\nCooperation is the key.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems withloot order.

I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>\nloot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they care<br/>\nabout is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>\n&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>\nchance.

I saw that he<br/>\npicked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an expensive<br/>\nitem). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>\nbronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>\nfor bronze armor&quot;...<br/>\nHas anyone else had this problem?<br/>\nWhat do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>\nJust wondering.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\nps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>\npeople cooperate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
