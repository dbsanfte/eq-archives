Everyone can<br>malee the kill to get experience. EverQuest is a \n  grouping oriented game, but<br>at the beginning levels, it is just not worth \n  it to group. Every class can<br>solo the first levels. Once it becomes harder \n  to kill the blue mobs you are<br>fighting, then you can start looking for \n  other PC to group with. But once<br>your druid gets a bit higher, you will not \n  malee the mob, you&#39;ll be<br>meditating to bomb or heal. You will still malee \n  at higher levels to kill<br>the mobs once they get to the point where they are \n  fleeing. <br><br>At level 3, you really don&#39;t need a decent weapon, stick with \n  your club<br>until you get level 6. Pocket all the coppers and sellable items \n  from your<br>kill. Once it gets too hard to kill these blues solo, your spells \n  will have<br>a better effect to kill. Druids can solo from level 1 to 60 \n  without ever<br>grouping one time. Do not fall behind on your spells. Buy them \n  and use them.<br><br>At your level you really do not need to venture out too \n  far from the guards,<br>unless there are other newbies there and you are \n  having a hard time finding<br>blue mobs.<br><br>Sistily<br>59 Gnomish \n  Warrior<br>Tunare Server <br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  -----Original Message-----<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  From:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rlebeau65 \n  [SMTP:rlebeau65@...]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  Sent:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday, December 31, 2001 9:07 \n  AM<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [EverQuest] Newbie has \n  questions<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  Hi,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have just bought the Everquest \n  trilogy box and have played a few <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  times.&nbsp; I have found a few helpful people out there but it seems<br>most \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are playing solo. Is this normal?&nbsp; \n  They suggest grouping so that is <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my first \n  question.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I am having trouble \n  getting money to get decent weapons.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a \n  level 3 Druid and only have a club.&nbsp; One guy gave me some \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; money but it wasn&#39;t much.&nbsp; He \n  suggested buying more spells, but I <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; really \n  would like a good weapon.&nbsp; Dealing 1-3 points of damage just \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; isn&#39;t cutting \n  it.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly for now, should I be starting \n  with a fighter type until I <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; really get use \n  the the game and interface.&nbsp; I really love wizards<br>and \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those type of characters but understand if \n  playing a warrior makes<br>it <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  easier.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always get confused on where I \n  am going. I think I venture too far<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out \n  of the city area.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for letting \n  the newbie post?&nbsp; ;)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  Rob<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ------------------------ Yahoo! \n  Groups Sponsor<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visit the EverQuest \n  homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your use of Yahoo!
