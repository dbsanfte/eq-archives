Bunch of Bull &%*(, I know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They are still legally obligated to keep the lines clear for voice. If you<br/>\nhear static then they are supposed to fix it. Don&#39;t mention internet to<br/>\nthem. Mention static on the lines when you&#39;re talking. When I spoke to qwest<br/>\na dialtone wasn&#39;t the only concern. They are supposed to keep the lines<br/>\nclear enough to hear without static. Although I feel your pain. Not only am<br/>\nI in a house with wiring about 30 years old, but I live out in the country.<br/>\nThe box with the phone lines just down the road is knocked over. I&#39;m also<br/>\nbehind a slick (which means they split the phone lines up to share amongst<br/>\nother people so I have huge bandwidth loss). The fastest I have ever<br/>\nconnected since moving here is 26k. And that is with a really good modem.<br/>\nBefore the good modem I was getting 21k. I actually need to remember to call<br/>\nthe phone company back and complain about the static on my lines...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just got off the phone with an eq tech, and he said to try downloading<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; files (and I didn&#39;t mention that some files keep re-downloading) and email<br/>\n&gt; him the names of them and he&#39;d email the files to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is a fix or troubleshooting guide on the eq website that specifically<br/>\nmentions certain files downloading over and over.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t get what verants prob is....DAoC works GREAT, no probs<br/>\n </span></blockquote>downloading,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; surfing the net is a bit slow, but managable, even downloading music isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; this big production that I need a damn tech support guy to help me do what<br/>\n&gt; should be a simple task.

I&#39;ve noticed that Verant has the<br/>\nattitude that the customers are out to screw them and approach us with<br/>\nmistrust. Really sad. They have completely forgotten rule #1 of game<br/>\nmaking-- make it FUN!<br/>\nI think Maxis is much cooler in that regard. They even incorporate user<br/>\ncreated skins and objects into their expansion packs.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh, and for all of you having SoL probs....he informed me that the are<br/>\n&gt; &#39;working on it&#39;, that they can&#39;t do things all speedy like, cause then if<br/>\n&gt; they screw up, they can&#39;t go back and fix it (say what???since when can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; you go back and fix something?) /sigh<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it might be more difficult to go back and fix it after it&#39;s screwed up<br/>\nthan to just take it slow and get it right the first time.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
