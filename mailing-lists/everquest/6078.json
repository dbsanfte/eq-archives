So far I&#39;ve got it up to 38 points without<br/>\nputting too much money in it besides spending on molds, sharpening<br/>\nstones, and water.  I&#39;d like to keep it that way.  But now it&#39;s<br/>\nbecoming a little less clear how I should proceed since the things I<br/>\nmake no longer give me more experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far things have gone as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nrusty stuff -&gt; tarnished stuff -&gt; ore -&gt; metal bits.  From metal bits<br/>\nI&#39;d make either files, studs, or skewers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I&#39;m wondering if there are more easy to find stuff that I<br/>\ncan make things from that will further my experience as a blacksmith?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
