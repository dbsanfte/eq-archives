I remember the run across Antonica to <br/>\nget from Qeynos to Freeport, out running Giants, that group in the <br/>\nmountains, Griffs, Gnolls, Orcs!  That was always fun.  And boat rides!<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to hate being in EC on Sunday.  Every channel was jammed with <br/>\nauctions, shouts and tells!  There were so many people there it was <br/>\nslow and glitchy.  And then there was the search to try and find the <br/>\nsellr.  But the deals!  And I used to make a ton of plat making arrows. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Ranger that would mean back to the days of the SSoM, Ivy Etched <br/>\narmor and Evileye bags.  How quaint!<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I&#39;d do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\nWarder of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
