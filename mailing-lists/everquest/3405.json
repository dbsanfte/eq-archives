I think we all<br/>\n&gt; realize that anytime you have a large number of<br/>\n&gt; people someplace it is going<br/>\n&gt; to zone. It is kindof amazing to realize that there<br/>\n&gt; are 200+ people in one<br/>\n&gt; zone though. I don&#39;t think people expected to see<br/>\n&gt; that many in one zone.<br/>\n&gt; Hopefully the lag will die down some as the novelty<br/>\n&gt; of the new features<br/>\n&gt; start to fade. Who knows though, maybe they might<br/>\n&gt; have to make a bazaar2.<br/>\n&gt; Until then, some of us with really pathetic &#39;net<br/>\n&gt; connections will have to<br/>\n&gt; wait until the fervor dies down.<br/>\n&gt; And nah. You&#39;re not going to get flamed. You&#39;re just<br/>\n&gt; stating the facts. :-)<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well I&#39;m probably going to get flamed for this but<br/>\n&gt; you all do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; realize that the bazaar is a new feature and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; going to get hammered<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by practically all the players in the first couple<br/>\n&gt; of weeks? If any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant admins monitor this list maybe they could<br/>\n&gt; post the stats on how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many hits the servers for the bazaar are getting<br/>\n&gt; and their processing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; percentage plus the net traffic stats. I bet that<br/>\n&gt; they will all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; practically be maxed out. Basically what I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; saying is, yes the lag is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; annoying but be patient and give it time and it<br/>\n&gt; will quickly even itself<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out. The problem is not your computer, it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; combination of your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; connection to the net and how many are also on at<br/>\n&gt; your local hub at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same time you are, (if you have a broadband<br/>\n&gt; connection), and that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; servers are taking a hellacious beating right now.<br/>\n&gt; The bank in Kelethin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is this way, it lags when everyone is meeting<br/>\n&gt; there but when everyone is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out hackin and slashin it&#39;s really smooth.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Happy Hunting!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Steve<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
