If you can actually make it to blackburrow safely it wasn&#39;t so bad from what I recall.<br/>\nAnother spot is East Commons. Hunting the lions, bears, and orcs. then you can move to west commons for the dervs and higher level bears. Just don&#39;t attack any near the druid ring.. oh wait.. just dont&#39; go near the druid ring. Killing the deathfist orcs gets you faction with freeport so it&#39;s good to do that.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-08-17, 15:29:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hell All<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;New to the group so I thought I would drop in and say hello.

Now being <br/>\n&gt;12th level, I play a Troll SK, what&#39;s a good place to hunt. I group <br/>\n&gt;when I can but the servers not always busy. Looking for good xp and <br/>\n&gt;coin of course.
