But I needed the xp and faction so I stayed. I was getting to loot a<br/>\nlittle bit but then one of the members looked at my gear and suddenly<br/>\ndecided that I didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; money or items bc I already had &quot;good stuff&quot;.<br/>\nNevermind that I had to work my ass off to get the money to buy the stuff<br/>\nand had no money left to buy spells or better items. I don&#39;t know where he<br/>\ngot off. I mean, I wasn&#39;t even getting xp from most of the stuff while he<br/>\nwas and he would&#39;ve been dead 10 times over if I hadn&#39;t saved him by using<br/>\nDDs to kill stuff before it could kill him. So he expected me to gain<br/>\nnothing but faction? Such a jerk. And the worst part was, he was main healer<br/>\nyet he refused to heal me when I had 1 bub of life left. He had 3 bubs of<br/>\nlife yet and started healing HIMSELF while I was near death. He wasn&#39;t even<br/>\ngetting aggrod on at the time. I was only injured so much bc I pulled some<br/>\norcs off of him so they wouldn&#39;t kill him. When I asked him nicely for a<br/>\nheal he said &quot;I heal the tanks first-- and I&#39;m the only one injured&quot;. I<br/>\nresponded with &quot;I think I did a pretty good job of tanking&quot;. I didn&#39;t get<br/>\nhealed til another person who wasn&#39;t in a group ran by and stopped to heal<br/>\nme.<br/>\nLuckily a guildmate of mine showed up and invited me to join his group. The<br/>\njerk was left on his own and he stupidly tried to attack the entire large<br/>\norc camp (in EC) on his own. I watched him die (nothing I could do about it<br/>\nreally).<br/>\nOh well.. don&#39;t mind me. just rambling.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you &quot;feel sad&quot; to see a 16 year old kid driving a new BMW or Corvette?<br/>\n&gt; Everquest resembles real life in many ways.

I&#39;ll get it one day so I&#39;m not envious.<br/>\n&gt; I just<br/>\n&gt; hate to see it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lena<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; It isnt sad, its real life. These things happen every day, both<br/>\n&gt; in-game and<br/>\n&gt; outside. If you are a core roleplayer just think of it as he had a<br/>\n&gt; rich<br/>\n&gt; uncle.
