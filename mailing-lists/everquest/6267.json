It&#39;s like <br/>\nits emulating you spuring it&#39;s side and saying &quot;Giddyup!&quot;. Oh and they <br/>\neat like mad! So either become good a baking or buy cheap food (Or <br/>\nbetter yet summon if you can) and keep it in an unbagged slot so it will <br/>\nbe the first food to get eaten.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the old debate of which is better, a Drog or a Horse, all I will <br/>\nsay is just keep this in mind, on a horse you constantly have his/her <br/>\nhead in your view and can make targeting a little difficult if you are <br/>\njust manually clicking on your target. With a Drog you don&#39;t have the <br/>\nhead in your view, unless you are surrounded by a bunch of gnomes!<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Durgaa<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 2         <br/>\n   Date: Thu, 30 Jun 2005 18:39:08 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;mushuplus&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mushuplus@...\">mushuplus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Are slow horses worth getting?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey look fun to ride on, but i don&#39;t think they are worth it because <br/>\non my friend&#39;s account he has a cheap drog and then i found out the <br/>\ncheap ones are slow =P lol.
