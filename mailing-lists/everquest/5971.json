For the game it is, and seeing that we<br/>\nare like 3 weeks into it, <br/>\n<br/>\nHATS OFF to SONY on a Great Job.<br/>\n<br/>\nServer stability vs Star Wars is second to none.  And<br/>\nWulf is 100% right.  There is marketing competition to<br/>\ncontend with not just the bottom line and a holiday<br/>\nseason.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey took their time and if you all think that the<br/>\nBETA was really a BETA, you should think again.  It<br/>\nwas a pre release now way a beta.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThey had the product 98% there if Microsoft had a beta<br/>\nas good there wouldn&#39;t exists UNIX  <br/>\n<br/>\nROFL<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy fellow gamers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just goes to show, you can&#39;t please all the people<br/>\n&gt; even some of the time.  If you&#39;re so hell bent<br/>\n&gt; against the game, then why are you even on this<br/>\n&gt; list???<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe your argument that EQ2 was rushed<br/>\n&gt; either.  Considering there was word of EQ2 in<br/>\n&gt; development long before there was ever a release<br/>\n&gt; date set, considering the game was in closed beta<br/>\n&gt; for months before we ever got a peek at it,<br/>\n&gt; considering it was in open beta for several months<br/>\n&gt; BEFORE it went live, AND considering the release<br/>\n&gt; date was even pushed back so tha tit came out later<br/>\n&gt; than it was supposed to, I seriously have a hard<br/>\n&gt; time believing it ws a rush job.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And apparently you don&#39;t know anything about<br/>\n&gt; business.  It would seem to me that to be<br/>\n&gt; competitive in the market place you have to take<br/>\n&gt; into account things like the release of other games<br/>\n&gt; and holidays and so on.  Let&#39;s face it, Sony Online<br/>\n&gt; Entertainment is a profiteering company.  they want<br/>\n&gt; to make money just like the rest of us.  If they<br/>\n&gt; have to cut a few edges to get the product out in<br/>\n&gt; manner to be more competitive with other companies,<br/>\n&gt; then that&#39;s what they have to do.  Since the game is<br/>\n&gt; an ongoing development, they can always add the<br/>\n&gt; stuff after the fact.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as I&#39;m concerned they did a damn good job<br/>\n&gt; with EQ2 and I think they will continue to do a damn<br/>\n&gt; good job with it.  EQ2 had far more content to it<br/>\n&gt; than Lineage II did when L2 was released.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Besides, SOE is only adding the stuff that people<br/>\n&gt; are asking for anyway, so if we don&#39;t like it, we<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t complain cause we&#39;re the ones who asked for<br/>\n&gt; it.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you really don&#39;t enjoy the game, then why are you<br/>\n&gt; here?  This list is supposed to be for people that<br/>\n&gt; like EverQuest and want to see it grow, not for<br/>\n&gt; people who are going to argue every single little<br/>\n&gt; nitpicky thing wrong with the game or SOE.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; time to move on....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: ej <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, December 08, 2004 7:59 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: Regular EQ<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Melanie Johnson wrote:<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; No, it actually makes it tougher.

You know exactly how many are<br/>\n&gt; coming and you can plan <br/>\n&gt;   for it.  EQ had &quot;linked&quot; mobs too, but you didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know how many were <br/>\n&gt;   coming.  WoW has linked mobs, but you really can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; tell which ones are <br/>\n&gt;   coming.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   EQ2 was a rushed product that probably needs about<br/>\n&gt; 6 more months of <br/>\n&gt;   development time.  They rushed it out because of<br/>\n&gt; WoW and Christmas.  Not <br/>\n&gt;   much of a surprise since SoE drove EQ into the<br/>\n&gt; ground as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nTake Yahoo!
