Couldn t have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-501001461\">Yeah the LD monster nearly got me killed last night on the Saryrn Server<br/>\nwhen I was playing my newly leveled shaman in EW hunting the uthork.<br/>\nCouldn&#39;t have come at a worse time I was OOM, LoHP (maybe had  5% hp),  all<br/>\nmy buffs were gone  (KEI included), pet was dead, and SoW was going. and I<br/>\nhad 3 Uthorks decide they wanted to break Enstill all at the same time .  Oh<br/>\nand I was soloing it.  Seeing as this was my first time in EW  and I was a<br/>\nnewly leveled 38 Shammy I was rather quite pleased with myself that I<br/>\nmanaged to hold my own against 4 Uthorks by myself  (well with help from my<br/>\nfaithful walking dot Xebaner) once and figured I could do it again. Well<br/>\nthat was when  everything went wrong when the conditions I stated above<br/>\nstarted to occur.  I had almost killed one of the uthorks when the other 3<br/>\ndecided to break Enstill  and I tried holding my own.  Forgot I was OOM and<br/>\nhad no more KEI and tried to cast Enstill on the mobs (can we say panic?)<br/>\nFinally I gave it up and ran when 2 of the uthorks decided that my pet<br/>\nwasn&#39;t worth their time and joined their buddy in chasing me leaving my pet<br/>\nto deal with an healthy Uthork. now turning to run probably was my worst<br/>\nmistake when I saw those other 2 coming cause I got stunned and started to<br/>\nspin. when I stopped spinning I began to run and realized I had no idea<br/>\nwhere the heck I was  Keep in mind I am new to the zone had come in earlier<br/>\nwith a guildy who took me directly to the Uthorks without giving me a tour<br/>\nof the site and logged after we had killed 2 or 3 uthorks.  SO I got lost<br/>\nand was  somewhere I have no Idea where in EW when I noticed that I was<br/>\ngetting no keyboard response.  that&#39;s when  looked at the connection<br/>\nindicator and saw that it was  a very broken yellow line that immediately<br/>\nwent to red and then  I get the &quot;You have been disconnected&quot; message and I<br/>\nknew I was a dead lvl 38 Shaman who would most likely be a Naked lvl 37<br/>\nBarbarian Shaman standing near the Waterfall in GD when I logged back on.<br/>\nWhen I logged back on I discovered I was on the bridge that goes to IC. And<br/>\nI WAS ALIVE With Sow still Blinking at me, still OOM, and 20 hp left on me<br/>\nAND STILL LEVEL 38<br/>\n<br/>\nCynfyn MacCulloch 51 DESK<br/>\nHalyburton Bearhugger 38 BarbShm<br/>\nSaltaque 12 HIEEnch<br/>\nQapmoc 11 HalfElf Ranger<br/>\nOroblram 9 Hu War<br/>\nDoktari 7 HIE Cleric<br/>\nDefender of the Faith<br/>\nSaryrn Server<br/>\nDoF Email list: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DoFGuild/<br/>\nCynfyn&#39;s EverQuest: http://cyfyn.hypermart.net/eq/<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Toni&quot; &lt;silly_girl4ever@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;EverQuest@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, October 12, 2002 1133<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: Error 1001<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems people have been having trouble everywhere.
