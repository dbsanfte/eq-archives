Thank you for sharing the link.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The sad thing is, you can just sit in GFay and watch the /ooc <br/>\nand /shout<br/>\n&gt; channel and see a lot of the stuff that Lowtax describes humorously <br/>\nin his<br/>\n&gt; &quot;newbie guide&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Example from my own experience on Tarew Marr server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other night I was playing my level 13 scratch (totally non-<br/>\ntwinked) Wood<br/>\n&gt; Elf Ranger. A level 1 HE enchanter started spamming GFay for 5pp to <br/>\nbuy her<br/>\n&gt; level 1 spells. Another person and I finally replied back in /ooc <br/>\nthat you<br/>\n&gt; could buy just about all the useful level 1 spells for a platinum <br/>\nor so. She<br/>\n&gt; then changed her spam to asking for 2pp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Someone else jumped in and chided us for &quot;being harsh&quot; so I decided <br/>\nto give<br/>\n&gt; the beggar 2pp just to see what happened. I tracked her down near <br/>\nFelwithe,<br/>\n&gt; hailed her, and gave her 2pp. The VERY next thing she says to me <br/>\nis &quot;you got<br/>\n&gt; any caster stuff?&quot; Not &quot;Thank You&quot;, not even &quot;ty&quot; or &quot;thx&quot;, <br/>\njust &quot;you got<br/>\n&gt; any caster stuff&quot;. I just said &quot;No, I am a Ranger, sorry&quot; and <br/>\nturned and<br/>\n&gt; left.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A few minutes later this same person was back spamming the zone for <br/>\ntiny<br/>\n&gt; daggers (ingredient to cast pet) because she &quot;looked everywhere in <br/>\nFelwithe&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;couldn&#39;t find them anywhere&quot;. I have played a HE enchanter, so <br/>\nI KNOW<br/>\n&gt; you can buy them for 1sp each from one of the 4 merchants in the <br/>\nroom where<br/>\n&gt; the Enchanter Guildmaster is, so I repeated that information <br/>\nin /ooc. She<br/>\n&gt; then asks for money to buy them because she didn&#39;t have any. I told <br/>\nher in<br/>\n&gt; /ooc &quot;An enchanter can get 1 sp for a wasp wing, and that happens <br/>\nto be how<br/>\n&gt; much a tiny dagger costs. Start killing stuff and stop begging.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I finally deleted my Enchanter at level 10 (I had also played <br/>\nhim<br/>\n&gt; without any help from my higher level characters) he had nearly all <br/>\nhis<br/>\n&gt; level 1, 4, and 8 spells, full (some looted, some bought) cloth <br/>\narmor, as<br/>\n&gt; well as 50pp in the bank, from just killing and looting everything <br/>\nhe was<br/>\n&gt; able to, and selling it to merchants, so I know it can be done. <br/>\nSure, he did<br/>\n&gt; a lot of corpse runs (this was before the patch that eliminated <br/>\ncorpse runs<br/>\n&gt; under level 10), but 1sp per wasp wing, 4sp per royal jelly, 3gp <br/>\nper wasp<br/>\n&gt; poison sac, 1pp per cracked staff, etc.at the merchants adds up <br/>\nfairly<br/>\n&gt; quickly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess maybe I was a litte harsh to that newbie chanter, yes, but <br/>\nI have<br/>\n&gt; used my Druid&#39;s bank account to equip numerous new druids and <br/>\nrangers in<br/>\n&gt; that zone with full leather armor, a half-way decent newbie weapon, <br/>\nand a<br/>\n&gt; little buffing (skin like diamond, sow, strength of stone, thorns, <br/>\nregen),<br/>\n&gt; but not because they begged. I did it because they seemed to be <br/>\nplayers that<br/>\n&gt; wanted to have fun and to play the game right, but needed a little <br/>\nboost,<br/>\n&gt; and I enjoy helping people. I don&#39;t enjoy beggars, though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone else have thoughts to share on players who spam the newbie <br/>\nzones<br/>\n&gt; asking to be given free money or items?
