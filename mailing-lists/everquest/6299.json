I imagine they will announce<br/>\n&gt; open testing registration periodically as the time<br/>\n&gt; draws near for its live release.  I did get<br/>\n&gt; registered and spent a pretty good hour plus<br/>\n&gt; downloading the beta files.  I have yet to play it,<br/>\n&gt; but I copied the email I received so people can see<br/>\n&gt; what it says.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS  Dont ask me for the FTP site address.  I wont<br/>\n&gt; give it to you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Welcome to the EverQuest(R) Depths of Darkhollow(TM)<br/>\n&gt; (DoD) beta!  Please read this entire email<br/>\n&gt; carefully. It contains all the information you will<br/>\n&gt; need to hit the ground running and make the most of<br/>\n&gt; your time in beta. Remember, you accepted the<br/>\n&gt; EverQuest Terms of Use, License and Non-Disclosure<br/>\n&gt; Agreement as a condition for acceptance into the<br/>\n&gt; beta program, and everything included here as well<br/>\n&gt; as what you see on the beta server, in beta-related<br/>\n&gt; communications and beta forums and message boards<br/>\n&gt; are covered by that agreement. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HOW DO I GET ON THE BETA SERVER?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In order to access the Depths of Darkhollow beta<br/>\n&gt; server, you will need to download the Beta patcher.<br/>\n&gt; The FTP site for downloading the patcher is listed<br/>\n&gt; below. There may be a lot of data to download, so<br/>\n&gt; please be patient.  You should run this patcher<br/>\n&gt; before you log in, every time.  Failing to do so may<br/>\n&gt; cause you to experience crashes or gameplay issues<br/>\n&gt; that could be fixed just by patching.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You may download the Depths of Darkhollow beta<br/>\n&gt; patcher at the following FTP site<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; FTP Site omitted due to NDA.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To get to the ftp site:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enter the ftp address into your Internet Explorer<br/>\n&gt; web browser.  It will bring you to the ftp site. The<br/>\n&gt; file you need is called EQBetaPatcher.zip.  Just<br/>\n&gt; right click on the file and copy it to your desktop.<br/>\n&gt;  Unzip the file and copy betaeverquest.exe into your<br/>\n&gt; root EverQuest directory (Should be in C:&#92;Program<br/>\n&gt; Files&#92;Sony&#92;EverQuest unless you changed your default<br/>\n&gt; installation.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Run this every time prior to logging in to the beta<br/>\n&gt; server. You will see the Beta Server on the server<br/>\n&gt; list, choose that server and log in.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HOW LONG IS BETA?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The beta test is scheduled to begin on July 20th,<br/>\n&gt; 2005 and is scheduled to end on September 13th,<br/>\n&gt; 2005, unless we decide to change these dates.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HOW DO I GET TO THE DoD ZONES?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When you get onto the beta server, create your<br/>\n&gt; character and head to the Plane of Knowledge. Find<br/>\n&gt; Old Man Thorren and he can teleport you to Corathus<br/>\n&gt; Creep.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HOW DO I COPY MY CHARACTER ONTO BETA?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For us to copy your favorite EverQuest character to<br/>\n&gt; the beta server, please indicate which character you<br/>\n&gt; want us to copy by logging into your play server as<br/>\n&gt; your favorite character. You indicate that you want<br/>\n&gt; us to copy an individual character by typing the<br/>\n&gt; command /beta in your chat window. Periodically we<br/>\n&gt; will run scripts that will copy characters to the<br/>\n&gt; beta server. Keep in mind that we will be running<br/>\n&gt; the character copies on an as-needed basis - not<br/>\n&gt; necessarily at regular intervals. It may take<br/>\n&gt; several days for us to copy your character.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; THE /betabuff COMMAND<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The level range needed to test all of the variations<br/>\n&gt; of dungeons for  DoD is huge.  In order to give you<br/>\n&gt; that ability to test as much of the expansion as<br/>\n&gt; possible, we have created a /betabuff command. <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s how you use it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Create a first level character on the beta server<br/>\n&gt; and log in with that character (this command will<br/>\n&gt; only work on 1st level characters).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. Type /betabuff CLASS LEVEL - where CLASS is the<br/>\n&gt; class of the character you would like to create, and<br/>\n&gt; LEVEL is the level that you want that character to<br/>\n&gt; be.  LEVEL can only be numbers divisible by 5,<br/>\n&gt; starting at 20.  So 20, 25, 30, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s it.  The character you created will be<br/>\n&gt; transformed into a character of the level and class<br/>\n&gt; you have chosen.  Your race and even gender may<br/>\n&gt; change as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BETA FEEDBACK<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are two methods for passing information to us<br/>\n&gt; about what you experience during the beta.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /bug should be used to report bugs.  Bugs are<br/>\n&gt; gameplay features that do not work, spelling errors,<br/>\n&gt; and anything that just does not work as intended. <br/>\n&gt; Please give us as much detail about the bug as you<br/>\n&gt; can think of when reporting it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /feedback should be used to send in comments about<br/>\n&gt; parts of the expansion that work properly, but that<br/>\n&gt; you would like to see changed.  If you discover an<br/>\n&gt; item that you think should have less Wis and more<br/>\n&gt; Int, then use /feedback.  If you think a certain<br/>\n&gt; encounter is too easy or too hard, use /feedback to<br/>\n&gt; report it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is important that you distinguish between these<br/>\n&gt; two options, as one is read primarily by our testing<br/>\n&gt; team and the other is read mostly by our game<br/>\n&gt; designers.  Sending a bug through /feedback can<br/>\n&gt; delay our ability to fix it, since we&#39;ll have to<br/>\n&gt; route that to our testers for verification.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please use this command to explore as many of the<br/>\n&gt; adventures as you can and report your findings to<br/>\n&gt; us.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you find yourself in dire need of assistance, you<br/>\n&gt; can use /petition to contact us for help.  Please<br/>\n&gt; only petition if the situation is one that you can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; correct yourself.  For example, if you used<br/>\n&gt; /betabuff to create a character and you have lost<br/>\n&gt; the corpse, there is no need to /petition.  You can<br/>\n&gt; just log out, create a new character and use the<br/>\n&gt; /betabuff command again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please remember that your participation in the beta<br/>\n&gt; program is subject to the Terms of Use, License and<br/>\n&gt; Non-Disclosure Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) which you<br/>\n&gt; have already agreed to. Your access in and to the<br/>\n&gt; beta program, including the patcher, is for your<br/>\n&gt; personal, non-commercial use only, in accordance<br/>\n&gt; with the Agreement, and any feedback you provide is<br/>\n&gt; confidential.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your time and effort; we appreciate<br/>\n&gt; your help testing this expansion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The EverQuest Depths of Darkhollow Development Team<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
