Hollowshade is one example, there are<br/>\n&gt; mobs that people farm for substances to smith, however those same mobs can<br/>\n&gt; be replaced by new mobs that don&#39;t have the substances they want by just a<br/>\n&gt; few kills in one area.  Usually if i was planning  on hunting a pertucular<br/>\n&gt; mob that can be effected as such...i usually ask what camps anyone has to<br/>\n&gt; make sure i&#39;m not going to interfer with them, but if noone replys what<br/>\n </span></blockquote>can<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you do....noone can read their minds...they might tell me they were later,<br/>\n&gt; and often i appologize saying I asked but noone said anything..they<br/>\n </span></blockquote>usually<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; understand and we try to get the mobs they were hunting back if they<br/>\n&gt; despawned for another set.
