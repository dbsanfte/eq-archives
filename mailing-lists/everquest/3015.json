CoM and Kedge sound possible with a small group, but what<br/>\ni read about the drop rate makes me sick. hate ... well, it is hate.<br/>\n<br/>\ni have been on air up to spiroc isle. it will be very interesting if i<br/>\never get to the 8th (or 7th, depends on how you count) isle. but there<br/>\nare other things to do first.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   - bilt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik<br/>\nlevel 53 female gnome magician<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
