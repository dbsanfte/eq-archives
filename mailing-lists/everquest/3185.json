The epic is two 1hs weapons.  Of<br/>\nall the skills for my 30 Warrior, I&#39;ve enjoyed the 1hs<br/>\nthe most due to the duel wield we get at 13, and then<br/>\ndouble attack at 15 makes it even more fun! <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;ve come across some wonderful bargains for<br/>\n2hb and 2hs weapons that had amazing stats and were<br/>\nlimited to warrior only or just a few other classes<br/>\nand sellers kept discouting the prices due to having a<br/>\nlimited market.  I landed a really fun 2hb weapon with<br/>\nsuper stats and some haste for a few hundred plat.  I<br/>\nwas forced to work on my 2hb then, but it&#39;s been worth<br/>\nit!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know a lot of melee classes that will switch out a<br/>\nweapon they aren&#39;t as skilled in during groups,<br/>\nespecially when the situation is well under control<br/>\nand there are more than one melee to help taunt.  This<br/>\nprovides an excellent opportunity to help work on<br/>\nthose skills!<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nNortic of Luclin<br/>\nBladze of Tribunal<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Melanie Roark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melanie_6602@...\">melanie_6602@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m currently leveling up a little warrior myself.<br/>\n&gt; Even though it makes fighting at a young age tough,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m working on all her weapon skills. As a result,<br/>\n&gt; they are all fairly low right now. But I feel that<br/>\n&gt; later on it will be worth it. My RL boyfriend plays<br/>\n&gt; a warrior as his main and at lvl 51, he&#39;s only good<br/>\n&gt; at a couple of weapon skills. He&#39;s the one who told<br/>\n&gt; me to train in all weapon skills since you find some<br/>\n&gt; nice weapons later in the game.<br/>\n&gt;  Rob LeBeau wrote:Ok, I have a level 11 warrior and<br/>\n&gt; would like your<br/>\n&gt; opinion on the following:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I started wondering why I was not hitting that much<br/>\n&gt; with him even though he has a good weapon. After<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; research, I found that the reason I am not hitting<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; much as others is because I have been switching<br/>\n&gt; between 2HS and 1HS weapons to increase the skills<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; each attribute.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Example: My skill in both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br/>\n&gt; attack is at like 152.  If I were to just use 1HS<br/>\n&gt; let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have proved this because now that I am using the<br/>\n&gt; 1HS<br/>\n&gt; more, the skill is close to 30 and my ATK rating is<br/>\n&gt; close to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is still at<br/>\n&gt; 152.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Would you continue to alternate both weapon types or<br/>\n&gt; would you just pick one and go with it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; THanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Sign up for SBC Yahoo!
