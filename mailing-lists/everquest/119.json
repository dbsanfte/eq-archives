I got as far as High Pass Hold <br/>\nwhen I was waylaid and killed by a gnoll soothsayer.  I retrieved my corpse <br/>\nand then spent an hour running around trying to find the way out of High Pass <br/>\nHold towards Freeport.  IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING!!!  It was also scary as hell <br/>\nseeing how I was practically naked and the only player character in the <br/>\nentire zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould someone please give me some advice or direction in how to get the hell <br/>\nout of High Pass Hold and through to Freeport?<br/>\n<br/>\nMcBanus of Halas</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
