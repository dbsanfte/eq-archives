I often go to GFay to buy stacks of<br/>\n&gt; Spiderling Silks, usually park myself at newbie lift<br/>\n&gt; and give SoW&#39;s and whatnot. Same deal in EC tunnel.<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s really starting to bug me is the number of<br/>\n&gt; Druids (and other classes for that matter) being<br/>\n&gt; downright stingy with things like SoW. I mean,<br/>\n&gt; nobody&#39;s obligated to give them out, but at least for<br/>\n&gt; me access to SoW was one of the primary reasons for<br/>\n&gt; playing a Druid, I don&#39;t mind sharing it cause I know<br/>\n&gt; how good it feels to be on the recieving end of one.<br/>\n&gt; (playing my rogue is maddening until some kind soul<br/>\n&gt; decides to SoW me, gods I need JBoots :) When<br/>\n&gt; something as simple as a laughably tiny amount of mana<br/>\n&gt; that will be recovered in two seconds of medding can<br/>\n&gt; enhance another person&#39;s gaming experience that much,<br/>\n&gt; I see it as a bargain. Plus, more often than not, for<br/>\n&gt; every ten or so SoW&#39;s I give out, I get a Clarity in<br/>\n&gt; exchange, or someone cuts me a deal on an item, or<br/>\n&gt; some other nicety. (had one guy give me a HQ Bear Pelt<br/>\n&gt; last night just because I SoWed him :) In a way I also<br/>\n&gt; view it as my contribution to the community as a<br/>\n&gt; whole. People have been very generous and helpful so<br/>\n&gt; far, it&#39;s the least I can do to give back a little. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Web-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
