Even though it makes \n  fighting at a young age tough, I&#39;m working on all her weapon skills. As a \n  result, they are all fairly low right now. But I feel that later on it will be \n  worth it. My RL boyfriend plays a warrior as his main and at lvl 51, he&#39;s only \n  good at a couple of weapon skills. He&#39;s the one who told me to train in all \n  weapon skills since you find some nice weapons later in the game. \n  <p>&nbsp;<b><i>Rob LeBeau </i></b> wrote: \n  <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;\"><tt>Ok, \n    I have a level 11 warrior and would like your<br>opinion on the \n    following:<br><br>I started wondering why I was not hitting that \n    much<br>with him even though he has a good weapon.
