Tasks are available<br/>\nto characters as low as level 3, and the low-level Taskmaster is in<br/>\nyour home town. I&#39;ve done tasks with various toons at levels 10, 20,<br/>\n31, and 65 now. The experience reward is decent at all those levels.<br/>\nThe lower-leveled tasks mostly force you to explore around and learn<br/>\nthe environment and worthwhile just for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Starshyyn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starshyyn@...\">starshyyn@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Merry Meet!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a sorta newby question.  Last spring I bought Evolution<br/>\n&gt; thinking I would<br/>\n&gt; re-join Norrath.  Well, apparently not!  My system couldn&#39;t handle<br/>\n&gt; the change<br/>\n&gt; on the first of April (no matter what I tried, my sad, tired machine<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t deal<br/>\n&gt; with the changes).  So, now I have a new machine that will work with<br/>\n&gt; the game<br/>\n&gt; and will be getting dsl shortly.   I will be using the game I bought<br/>\n&gt; (Evolution) and<br/>\n&gt; would like to know if any of the expansions beyond LoY offer anything<br/>\n&gt; for the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;new&#39;, young player or if they are mostly for above levels 20, 30,<br/>\n&gt; 40, 50 or more?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I first played (on a borrowed account to see if I would like it)<br/>\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; out of the room/building where I was created!!!  It was hysterical! <br/>\n&gt; My Mentor had<br/>\n&gt; to come get me!  and he was kos in Felwithe!
