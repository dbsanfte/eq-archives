I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even get past the login screen for 5 or 10 minutes.  Kept saying that it<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t connect to login server.  Never had that happen unless it was<br/>\n&gt; down<br/>\n&gt; for a patch (which it wasn&#39;t).  Also noticed that the times when I choose<br/>\n&gt; my server, and going to the character screen, and the time from the<br/>\n&gt; character screen to the game are much longer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m running a Celeron 533 w/ 185 MB ram, windows ME a cable modem, and<br/>\n&gt; about 2GB of drive space for windows to write to.
