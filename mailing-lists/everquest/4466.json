I thought I had read it was something with an AA point, but now I can&#39;t find where I read it at, LOL. My main is 191 skill in Baking.  I plan on taking her to 250...but I also want to do Tailoring with her.  She is a Halfling, and I am interested in making the Haversack 100% WR bags also.  If this is not possible (to GM two different skills) I may just keep Baking at 200, and go forward with GM Tailoring, as that probably would hold a better profit, just in the bags, alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I was reading on Caster&#39;s Realm, under the Warrior section, and it lists a Discipline called Resistance at Level 30.  Problem is, when I type in /resistance, it says invalid command.  Am I doing something wrong, is that not the command for it?  I have tried my /shield command, and that works fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone can help with these, I would greatly appreciate it!  Thanks...and I hope everyone is having a good week so far!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nBela<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nBela<br/>\n<br/>\n~*~Is all that we see or seem, but a dream within a dream?~*~<br/>\n                   ~*~Edgar Allen Poe~*~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
