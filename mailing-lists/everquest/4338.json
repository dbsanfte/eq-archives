I found it. Unfortunately, I mistakenly thought that one of <br/>\nmy Shaman spells was an offensive spell. It was something like Inner <br/>\nFire. It sounded like it would burn something when cast. I died <br/>\nabout 15 times before I finally figured out that something was <br/>\nwrong. I cast the spell on myself and discovered that I was <br/>\nincreasing my hit points. I hope that the skelletons and the rock <br/>\nhoppers appreciated me for being sporting enough to protect them <br/>\nfrom damage while I was fighting them. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk. I have a minor healing spell and a spell that raises hit points. <br/>\nI have a shaman so I can&#39;t use my club. I tried to equip it with no <br/>\nsuccess. I have no money. No one wants to buy mushrooms (must be a <br/>\ndrug free town). I think that I need to somehow come up with some <br/>\nmoney so that I can buy a scroll with a spell that can do damage. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t seem to be able to kill anything bare handed. I just keep <br/>\ngetting killed. Does anybody have any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nI could delete the character, start over, maybe sell one or both of <br/>\nmy spell scrolls and buy an attack spell scroll. But do I really <br/>\nneed to? Is there still hope for my character?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Edward</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
