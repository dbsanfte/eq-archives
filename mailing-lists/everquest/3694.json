Solo at 34 in EW seems a <br/>\nbit <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tough, even if I need the tufts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; try IC and go for cougars, or move further to GD (and thurgadin - <br/>\nthe lovely dwarven town) and hunt tizmaks (lowest level i hit <br/>\n&gt; them with a group was with 2x26 monk, but i had to bring my cleric <br/>\nafter some rounds).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; or try Drakkel Wolves if you want to go for thurgadin and skyshrine <br/>\nfaction ... the Tracking Wolves should be a bit lower, and <br/>\n&gt; give you good faction with Kael (frost giants) but lower it with <br/>\nThurgadin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; IMHO it is better to start with Thurgadin (and SS) faction, because <br/>\nit makes the start in Velious easier: two zones you can <br/>\n&gt; call home (or actually use the bank ... :-). also - if your SS <br/>\nfaction is good enough - you can gate/port to WL without <br/>\n&gt; checking if Wuoshi is up (normally this poor lady is killed every <br/>\nweek). and if you start hunting in CS (another quad kiter ... :-<br/>\n&gt; ( ... zone is still popular for this, but too small to supply many <br/>\nquadders at once) you have a city just one zone away (on the <br/>\n&gt; other hand this shouldn&#39;t be really a problem for a druid).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; after completing (or getting it to a certain level) some of the <br/>\nthurgadin quests (like the prayer shawl) and you don&#39;t need <br/>\n&gt; Thurgadin as a base, you can start to work on your Kael faction <br/>\nwith killing Dwarves in icewell keep (this is sort of higher <br/>\n&gt; level stuff). so after some (long) time, you can have SS and Kael <br/>\nfaction.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; good luck and have fun<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   - bilt<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Biltilie Dwimmerlaik<br/>\n&gt; level 54 female gnome magician<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
