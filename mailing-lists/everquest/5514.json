Not good odds (one attack per copper).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I have direction sense?  And why would you buy a compass?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a compass on my screen.  I already know what direction I am <br/>\nfacing.  My direction sense is at 200 and it still only works about <br/>\n60% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a monk, how do I improve my safe fall skill without spending all <br/>\nmy points on it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep jumping off tall things and taking damage but no improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are all the characters white?  What if I want to play a black <br/>\nperson?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell that&#39;s about it for now.  I look foreword (because my eyes are <br/>\nin the front of my head :P ) to your answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
