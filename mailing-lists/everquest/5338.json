It&#39;s true. Most people who get THAT<br/>\nlost in EQ are the kind of people who would become<br/>\nlost in something else, if they hadn&#39;t found EQ to<br/>\nfill their time.

The day you see<br/>\n&gt; someone go into DTs from EQ, you can talk to me<br/>\n&gt; about it being an addiction. These people play too<br/>\n&gt; much for other reasons (insecurity, mental problems,<br/>\n&gt; withdrawal).

I know people who let their house<br/>\n&gt; go, play from the time they get home from work til<br/>\n&gt; the time they go to bed, and their small children<br/>\n&gt; live there knowing they come second to a video game.<br/>\n&gt; Another person I know is a huge lady. She tells me<br/>\n&gt; that she loves EQ and spends all her free time there<br/>\n&gt; because where else can she be beautiful and skinny.<br/>\n&gt; She has children too. I keep hearing about how they<br/>\n&gt; get up to go to bed and find their kids asleep on<br/>\n&gt; the floor near their computer desk and they didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even realize the children were there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   It is sad. And I think this happens far more than<br/>\n&gt; people will admit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I think it is a true addiction for some.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on the eighth day God said, &quot;O.K.
