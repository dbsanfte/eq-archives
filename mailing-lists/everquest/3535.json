It will happen \n  someday. Here let<br>&gt; me tell you my story and see if you feel any better \n  ok?<br>&gt;<br>Huh? You can&#39;t give up something you never tried. lol. I&#39;m not \n  feeling bad<br>or anything. I just don&#39;t give a rats ass. lol.<br>I don&#39;t want \n  to date anyone or anything like that. Just not interested. It<br>would \n  probably cut into my EQ gaming time too much.<br>I&#39;m happy being \n  single.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Back in 1988 I met this girl going to the local Jr. \n  college in the town<br>&gt; I was living in. I was a senior in high school and \n  we really hit it off.<br>&gt; I&#39;ll call her &quot;K&quot;, K and I were always together \n  and I soon fell madly in<br>&gt; love with her. Soon the school year came to a \n  close, things were<br>&gt; changing a little for us, I actually cut my waist \n  long hair so her<br>&gt; parents wouldn&#39;t freak! Yea, I really liked \n  her!<br>&gt; Well after she moved back to Denver I got a phone call from her. \n  She<br>&gt; wanted to break up and see other people. Of course I was \n  devastated,<br>&gt; (I&#39;m one of those sappy sensitive types), and it was hard. \n  I agreed<br>&gt; because I really didn&#39;t have the experience in relationships \n  to try and<br>&gt; work something out. Well two weeks pass and my graduation \n  came. K shows<br>&gt; up to go to my graduation, which was cool and all but \n  the night before<br>&gt; we get into this nasty fight. We&#39;re cruising along \n  and there is a truck<br>&gt; full of some of my female friends fom school and \n  they are drunk off<br>&gt; their ass! They&#39;re whopin&#39; and hollarin&#39; having a \n  good ol&#39; time. Well K<br>&gt; suddenly jumps out of the passenger seat and \n  practically into my lap.<br>&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t look at them.&quot; She says to me as she \n  entwines her arm in mine.<br>&gt; &quot;Excuse me? You broke up with me remember?&quot; \n  I said back to her, &quot;I can<br>&gt; look at whomever I want!&quot; granted it \n  probably wasn&#39;t the most mature way<br>&gt; to put it but either way we ended \n  up into a fight. So we came home and<br>&gt; went to bed. (I left a bunch of \n  non-important stuff out to save time,<br>&gt; btw nothing happened.)<br>&gt; \n  The next morning I woke up before she did. I was lying there looking \n  at<br>&gt; her and thinking this will be the last time we see each other. So \n  I<br>&gt; stroke her arm ans she wakes up. We start to kiss and one thing \n  leads to<br>&gt; another. It was my first time mind you so I was really \n  nervous about<br>&gt; that and to top it off, my Mother was asleep in the next \n  room! So<br>&gt; afterwards I ask the usual guy question, of &quot;How was I&quot; and \n  her response<br>&gt; was &quot;I&#39;ve had bigger.&quot; SMAK! Oh that hurt! I was \n  destroyed, whether or<br>&gt; not it was true, (My wife says she&#39;s full of \n  crap!), it really hurt.<br>&gt; This began a 7 year drought for me. I \n  completely shut myself off. I<br>&gt; didn&#39;t date, never went out, got into \n  stamp collecting. ;D Man it was<br>&gt; rough! So finally to make an \n  incredibly long story a little shorter I<br>&gt; finally got back into the \n  dating scene. I put an ad out on<br>&gt; coloradosingles.com which was a great \n  site because I&#39;ll never meet<br>&gt; someone say in Pennsylvania! I don&#39;t \n  suggest going to that site now<br>&gt; because they are now a &quot;swinger&#39;s&quot; \n  site, unless of course your into<br>&gt; that. :-)<br>&gt; So now you know \n  that love can happen but it just takes time. Hey are you<br>&gt; going to the \n  Denver Everquest Meetup? <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.meetup.com/\">http://everquest.meetup.com/</a> \n  I&#39;m<br>&gt; going to meet some fellow CO Eqer&#39;s. Who know, you might meet \n  that<br>&gt; someone! ;-)<br>&gt;<br>Thanks for sharing. :-)<br>Glad things \n  worked out for you in the end. :-)<br>I&#39;m stuck on the farm taking care of my \n  animals so I can&#39;t go to conventions<br>and stuff.<br>I&#39;m a low energy person. \n  I do not have the energy to deal with people all<br>the time. Nor do I have \n  the desire to expend energy to work on a<br>relationship. I&#39;m just extremely \n  lazy. Too lazy to bother with a<br>relationship. And I don&#39;t feel any need to \n  find someone. I like things the<br>way they \n  are.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
