I do not want to keep paying for it, as I never use it, but <br/>\nI feel funny about just letting itdie. So, I&#39;d like someone that <br/>\ncould use it to take it over. Now, I am looking for some sort of <br/>\ncompensation. NO real money, but a donation to my guild in the way of <br/>\nplatinum or gear would be well considered. Do not ask me how much or <br/>\nwhat items  I don&#39;t know. If you are interested, just send an email <br/>\nto me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:z_elder@...\">z_elder@...</a> saying &quot;I would like to donate 25k to your <br/>\ncause in exchange for the account&quot;  or whatever.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
