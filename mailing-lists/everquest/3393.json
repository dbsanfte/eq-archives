Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>\nLike can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the other<br/>\nparts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is there..<br/>\ndoes it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I will<br/>\nhit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to zone<br/>\nbeginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the higher<br/>\nlvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
