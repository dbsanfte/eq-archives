I used to be a guild leader,<br/>\nand I can&#39;t count the number of times that newb&#39;s joined the guild and<br/>\nasked to be powerleveled, even though they had only been playing EQ<br/>\nfor a couple of weeks.  I always refused and tried to explain how that<br/>\nwould hurt them in the long run.  More times than not, they would<br/>\nleave the guild and join another guild that was more liberal about<br/>\ndoing such things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving played for 5 years, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen the enchanter who<br/>\njoins a pick up group, and when you get adds, they start off tanking<br/>\ninstead of mezzing the adds.  That is just scary to me, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Wulfric Rennison&quot; &lt;wulftech@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t PL other people.

I mean, if<br/>\n&gt;   you&#39;re trying to catch up to someone else to be able to group with<br/>\n&gt;   them (and you&#39;ve actually gotten a toon above 20 before), then I could<br/>\n&gt;   see it.  But powerleveling people up to 20+, just because they want to<br/>\n&gt;   be uber and go to better zones for better drops isn&#39;t teaching them<br/>\n&gt;   how to play their character very well, IMO.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I have more fun fighting and scratching my way toward 70, than just<br/>\n&gt;   killing the same mobs over and over until they turn blue, them moving<br/>\n&gt;   to another zone to kill tougher stuff.  To me, it&#39;s the journey and<br/>\n&gt;   learning to play your character properly.  Nothing irks me more than<br/>\n&gt;   to group with someone who is level 60, but has no real clue as to how<br/>\n&gt;   to play their toon.  It steals from everyone in the groups good<br/>\n&gt;   experience to have to &quot;take care of&quot; the newb who was PL&#39;d to 60.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   /rant off<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;   YAHOO!
