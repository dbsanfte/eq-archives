It keeps rebooting itself for no<br/>\nreason. The microsoft error report thing said there was some driver conflict<br/>\ncausing it but we don&#39;t know what driver it is and it often reboots before<br/>\nwe can get far enough to tell. Well, that and my brother is not willing to<br/>\ntake the time to mess with it and expects me to fix it for him.<br/>\nI know we had problems before and had to pay the computer shop we bought it<br/>\nfrom to fix a problem but it turns out they were the reason the problem<br/>\nexisited. One of their employees loaded software and drivers on it that were<br/>\ncausing it to not work before and I don&#39;t know if they left some of it or<br/>\nwhat. Really frustrating.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Heh heh not to brag or anything but I have no lag in the Bazaar..gotta<br/>\n </span></blockquote>love<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; DSL...I don&#39;t really remember the hardware stats on my PC but it has top<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the line stuff as of November 02 and I love it.
