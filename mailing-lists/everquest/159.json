I just feel that&#39;s its part of the game..  and all magic users know spells are not cheap :)  we need help in the beginning...  :)  hehe...     My fellow magic users are complaining that they cant find some spells and feel that they are were left out of the game ( which means immediately post vulgarities to anyone wishing to help them ) later only to find that its there, just in certain cities.. they need only explore the game further.. i know that some spells are not working correctly but its not worth hating someone else for it... :)<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Shane Bole [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>]<br/>\n    Sent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 3:13 PM<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n    Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Role Playing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    thats true.. but this game was meant to be an RPG and you find people running around twinking or overcharging for their services or making characters just for selling crap instead of /auctioning. ive seen some of these people, it pisses me off. this is a RPG, not some stupid place you run around greedy ripping people off. They disrespect necromancers, not through the character, but in their own words. that is not right and I believe its called necrobashing..? its hard to play them now with everyone giving you bs dueling you all the time<br/>\n      ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n      From: Whitmore, Lance <br/>\n      To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n      Sent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 3:01 PM<br/>\n      Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Role Playing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      You just have to face it.. everybody wants everything today. Its just a representation of soceity and the culture we live in.  I myself look at them sometimes when i feel im stuck.  The problem is though is.. during the game people /ooc or /shout out for solutions and people are so quick to give them the answer to any question. Unfortutely the answer is right there i cant block it out I can remove it from my mind.  I just wish that people would try to keep some mystery to the game, and i know i can just filter out Shouts and Out of Characters but... i shouldnt have to do that to enjoy the game.  Everyone just wants a hand out.. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n      -----Original Message----- <br/>\n      From: Shane Bole [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>] <br/>\n      Sent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 2:03 PM <br/>\n      To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n      Subject: [EverQuest] Role Playing <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      From: &quot;Shane Bole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n      this is pretty lame... this is an RPG, but on all the polls, people want <br/>\n      walkthroughs on quests? where is the fun in that? maybe a hint or 2, but its <br/>\n      no fun walking around following a guide telling you to avoid so and so <br/>\n      whatever to not get killed. <br/>\n      just wondering if anyone aggrees with this... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n      Shop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.! <br/>\n      Live Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns! <br/>\n      Accessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!! <br/>\n                <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0</a> <br/>\n      ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n      Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
