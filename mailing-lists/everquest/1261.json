Sometimes you group with the only people available though. Like in<br/>\nHighpass if you need in a group you&#39;re stuck with the people camping the<br/>\nroom you want to camp.<br/>\nI&#39;ve had mostly good experiences with looting but there are a few people<br/>\nwho&#39;ve given me trouble. One thing that pissed me off-- I was group leader<br/>\nand had alpha loot established. My computer crashed. When i logged back in<br/>\nthere was a new group leader. Despite the fact that I had been at the spawn<br/>\npoint first and had established the group, he felt that bc he had reinvited<br/>\npeople that he was now in charge. He said it was FFA -- ninja loot.<br/>\nWhen I asked them to allow me to loot just once corpse he told me I could if<br/>\nI was fast enough. Often while I was busy healing him he&#39;d go loot<br/>\nsomething. When it was clear he didn&#39;t appreciate my help, I left. I mean, I<br/>\nneed money to buy spells and stuff.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I, too, play a main healer (cleric), and have encountered this many<br/>\n&gt; times.  I either decide that the experience is worth it and miss out<br/>\n&gt; on looting, or I quit the group and look for another.  The tanks<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t appreciate what you bring to the group until you are gone.<br/>\n&gt; Also, while there are more of the type looter you describe in the<br/>\n&gt; game, there are many who strive to be fair and succeed.  Perhaps you<br/>\n&gt; should choose your friends more wisely...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my 2 cp worth...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Paul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few<br/>\n&gt; problems with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play<br/>\n&gt; the main<br/>\n&gt; &gt; healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to<br/>\n&gt; establish alpha<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All<br/>\n&gt; they care<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else<br/>\n&gt; gets a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of<br/>\n&gt; loot.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and<br/>\n&gt; he was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>\n&gt; expensive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he<br/>\n&gt; picked up a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just wondering.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people cooperate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
