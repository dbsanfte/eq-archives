As far as Guild&#39;s..... I&#39;ve not become a<br/>\nmember of one yet.  I don&#39;t really have the time it takes to be in a Guild.<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t want to be a leader either.  I enjoy the game for what it is, a<br/>\ngame and I&#39;m having fun meeting new people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be playing Allilee and Maralexis tonight about 7 pm PDT if anyone on<br/>\nTarew wants to say hello.
