What a conversation starter!<br/>\n<br/>\nG&#39;Fay is famous for the /ooc beggar.  I, like you, usually end up &quot;chiding&quot;<br/>\nany beggar that pollutes the chat with a constant cry for platinum or even<br/>\nPower Leveling and gear. But, I have never been accused of being too harsh<br/>\nwith someone.  Most people start sending me tells agreeing with me about<br/>\nstupid beggars, and then they /ooc support to my discouragement of begging.<br/>\nAnd NOTHING pisses me off more than the ungrateful player. I have on<br/>\noccasion given some plat or newbie gear to people that wouldn&#39;t stop begging<br/>\njust to shut them up. And yes, I would say that most of the begging souls<br/>\nthat I have donated anything to were just as ungrateful as the chap that you<br/>\ndescribed.  They can&#39;t even bother to type 2 letters -TY- or God forbid that<br/>\nthey might actually /bow or /kneel or /thank...  &lt;:-P&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI too often seek out young players above 3rd or 4th season that appear to be<br/>\nworking hard to advance themselves the way that most of us did as<br/>\nNewB&#39;s....and while I expect nothing in return for the small gifts that I<br/>\ngive. I find that more often than not these players are very thankful and<br/>\nbenevolent.  It just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to make some new<br/>\nplayer&#39;s day.<br/>\nI have found that it &quot;pays&quot; to work hard for the things that you want--in RL<br/>\nand in EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was going to say something about how all beggars should publicly die slow<br/>\ncruel deaths in explicit detail, but I&#39;ll leave it to your imagination----<br/>\n<br/>\nRedfists Bakdafugup - Cleric of His Holiness, Brell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n( I can be found on the Druzzil Ro server at odd times of the day and night,<br/>\nfeel free to say hello or even BEG from me, well that is to say that if you<br/>\nwould like to make the list of people that will never ever ever get a free<br/>\nor cheap REZ from me you should definitely beg.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
