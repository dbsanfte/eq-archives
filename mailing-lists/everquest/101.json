I would not feel very well if i had worked up my player 10+ lvls and found that one day, the character was deleted... its great for users to spend some time there..  heck i have 3 characters on there myself..  I just wouldnt advise a newbie to start there.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Vespair<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Shane Bole [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>]<br/>\n    Sent: Friday, April 23, 1999 4:05 PM<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n    Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Dark Elf Shadow Warrior - Newbie Fodder<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    if nobody was on the test server they swould have trouble testing out the weekly patches. It&#39;s actually quite nice there, not many people and it is almost like solo play (for you whiners), and I heard it&#39;s alot easier to raise a character in freeport because its not so crowded with people stealing kills<br/>\n      ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n      From: Whitmore, Lance <br/>\n      To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n      Sent: Friday, April 23, 1999 10:41 AM<br/>\n      Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Dark Elf Shadow Warrior - Newbie Fodder<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      maybe you should pick another server other than Test Server... most people reside on the other servers.. im sure you will find someone that can help you online there at the same level as you.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Vespair (Vesheen Server) <br/>\n<br/>\n      -----Original Message----- <br/>\n      From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BobbiS7@...\">BobbiS7@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BobbiS7@...\">BobbiS7@...</a>] <br/>\n      Sent: Thursday, April 22, 1999 8:11 PM <br/>\n      To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n      Subject: [EverQuest] Dark Elf Shadow Warrior - Newbie Fodder <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BobbiS7@...\">BobbiS7@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n      Last night I just started a Dark Elf.  <br/>\n      Walk on the Wild Side. <br/>\n<br/>\n      My first real character experience requiring so much <br/>\n      swimming.
