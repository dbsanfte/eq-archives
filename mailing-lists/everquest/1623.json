They always seem to assume that the players<br/>\nare guilty of some wrongdoing.<br/>\nThey are so concerned about making things &quot;fair&quot; that they make it unfair<br/>\nfor the players. They ban players for taking advantage of bugs or any<br/>\nadvantage they have over mobs yet mobs can still hit players through walls<br/>\nand solid objects, can walk thru objects (like trees, walls, stones), and<br/>\ncan hit from 5 feet away when the players can&#39;t hit. They can manage to be<br/>\ninvisible and unhittable to the player yet that is considered &quot;fair&quot;.<br/>\nAlso, when a player dies, his/her pet disappears. but when a mob dies, it&#39;s<br/>\npet stays and can kill the players. I think that&#39;s wrong. Verant needs to<br/>\nwork on making the game a little more fair for the players again.<br/>\nI know people who refuse to get EQ until they fix the mobs walking thru<br/>\ntrees and walls bit. oh, and mobs can run straight up vertical surfaces with<br/>\nno problem while players can&#39;t. that&#39;s another problem that needs to be<br/>\nworked out.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  Prior to banning any accounts reported as compromised, we will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; conduct a thorough review of the accounts in question and determine<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the appropriate course of action on those accounts. Accounts will only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be banned based on information gathered through our investigation and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not merely as a result of external allegations.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From my understanding, this bit was added to avoid cases like that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>pointed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; out by Mu, when someone may have a personal vendetta against you and may<br/>\n&gt; somehow find out your account username then call up Verant and claim that<br/>\n&gt; you stole their account just to have your account banned.  A rudimentary<br/>\n&gt; investigation would probably turn up who the original account owner was.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, I don&#39;t think this type of investigation would protect against a<br/>\n&gt; real &quot;hack&quot; of Verants systems.  If a completely unrelated third party<br/>\n&gt; were to obtain username and passwords to accounts on Verants systems, I<br/>\n&gt; would think it to be difficult for the owner of a compromised account to<br/>\n&gt; prove that they didn&#39;t give out any account information.  It seems to have<br/>\n&gt; been turned into a case of guilty until proven innocent.  Although this in<br/>\n&gt; no way benefits the victim (owner of compromised account), Verant is a<br/>\n&gt; business and businesses are in it to make money.  This probably seemed<br/>\n&gt; like the most economical solution for them with little work on their end<br/>\n&gt; and  &quot;should&quot; not have negative effects on the largest portion of the user<br/>\n&gt; base.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; mac<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
