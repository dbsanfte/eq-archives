I agree on the opening <br/>\nand bashing of chests and things. Other games I&#39;ve played, it&#39;s kinda <br/>\nfun finding new treasures in chests and when I find a chest in EQ I <br/>\nwant to bash it then remember I can&#39;t LOL. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the private space will be cool! My help some of the <br/>\nlower-level players (such as myself) level a little faster without <br/>\ngetting accused of Ks&#39;ing :) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe EQ site mentioned LoY Broken Skull was the starting point of this <br/>\nnew expansion. Does anyone know if I need to purchase LoY first <br/>\nbefore I can buy the new expansion?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; So, another expansion pack is coming out.
