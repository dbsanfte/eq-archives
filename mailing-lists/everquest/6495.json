People have been giving me<br/>\npet toys for three years and I didn&#39;t know what to do with them. My<br/>\nkitty shaman has a wolf pet and wolves don&#39;t have inventory slots to<br/>\nput things into. So I just tried &quot;giving&quot; my pet the toy this time.<br/>\nSurprise! Surprise! So that&#39;s how you do it. G.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also figured out why you only give a temporary pet temporary<br/>\ntoys. Fortunately I did that before I gave it something really<br/>\nexpensive. G. Pets don&#39;t give their toys back.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdward Fox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
