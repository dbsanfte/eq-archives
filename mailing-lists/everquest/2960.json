Having never played an online rpg before I have a few questions ?<br/>\n&gt; (Forgive my lack of knowledge and feel free to laugh at my questions)<br/>\n&gt; 1. Being used to playing solo games I could pretty much play at my<br/>\n&gt; own pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other online players but<br/>\n&gt; seeing as I am a casual gamer i only spend  10-15 hours a week gaming<br/>\n&gt; is this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play occurs with whoever<br/>\n&gt; is online at the time and am I not tied into a specific group/times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi! Yeah, Everquest is flexible. You can play however long or short you<br/>\nwant. There are different hunting grounds with different paces. you can try<br/>\nto level up quickly, or you can explore and meet the npcs and so forth. It&#39;s<br/>\npretty neat.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join with?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s fairly easy. Depends on what time you get on. Some times have more<br/>\nplayers than others. Generally at level 1 you can solo if you&#39;re careful.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kunak, etc) does it<br/>\n&gt; matter which one I start with or are the later addons geared for<br/>\n&gt; higher level characters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kunark is an expansion. You have to have the original to play it. It has one<br/>\nstarting race. For other races it is a higher level area. I recommend either<br/>\nstarting in the original world or in the new expansion of Luclin.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the system requirements<br/>\n&gt; but what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866, 128sdram, 32mb ddr nvidia<br/>\n&gt; geforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or should I wait<br/>\n&gt; till I upgrade.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe that would work. I was able to play the original EQ on a less<br/>\nsophisticated machine. You will have to cut down on character models though<br/>\nso you won&#39;t be able to enjoy as much of the graphics. The game will give<br/>\nyou recommendations on how many character models you should have switched<br/>\non. Even though I have a 1.4Ghz AMD Athlon, 1Gb of RAM, 64mb Nvidia GeForce<br/>\n2 MX, and Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card, I only use a few of the<br/>\nmodels because my internet connection is only 21k.<br/>\nI recommend that you try a trial version of EverQuest (you can contact their<br/>\nmarketting department at their website I believe) to find out how to get<br/>\none. If your system has problems with the trial, you may want to wait to<br/>\nupgrade. If you are planning to upgrade you may want to use pricegrabber.com<br/>\nto search for parts. Also, computershopper.com has reviews on the products<br/>\nand which ones are best. The better the video card the better the framerate<br/>\nyou will get.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any feedback<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My pleasure. I hope you join the world of EverQuest soon. I&#39;d love to see<br/>\nyou on The Tribunal server sometime.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
