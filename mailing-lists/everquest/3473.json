What is OS?<br/>\n  KC might be a good idea. Thanks!<br/>\n  Speaking of jaggedpine I had someone beg me to come to Qeynos Hills with<br/>\n  them to rez a bunch of people who were killed in some sort of GM event.<br/>\nall<br/>\n  kinds of npcs were in front of surefall glade. I hung out and rezzed<br/>\npeople<br/>\n  then after waiting and finding they might not be able to make it happen<br/>\n  again for another hour or more I decided to head out and get some sleep.<br/>\n  Was anyone around for an event of that type in Qhills?<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n  Only 2 places like that are Vox&#39;s lair (only inside it where she is, NOT<br/>\n  the rest of the zone) and Naggy&#39;s lair (same thing). Any OTHER part of the<br/>\n  zone is 100% normal for all levels, and can be gone into. As for exp...try<br/>\n  Karnor&#39;s and  OS. Jaggedpine might be a good bet too.<br/>\n    ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n    From: Su<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n    Sent: Sunday, July 28, 2002 12:38 PM<br/>\n    Subject: [EverQuest] Hunting grounds for 50+<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place to hunt<br/>\n  to<br/>\n    get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>\n    Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the<br/>\nother<br/>\n    parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is<br/>\nthere..<br/>\n    does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I<br/>\n  will<br/>\n    hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to<br/>\n  zone<br/>\n    beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the<br/>\n  higher<br/>\n    lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>\n    Any suggestions?<br/>\n    luv,<br/>\n    -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Yahoo!
