I got just<br/>\n&gt; enough bile to get my drum & to get the first part of the pottery quest<br/>\n&gt; done, but I can&#39;t seem to get any more!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So far I know Xakra bile drops off of Xakra Larvae & the rockhopper<br/>\n&gt; blood drops off of young rockhoppers .. both in the shar val pit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Ariaya, Ranger of 20 seasons<br/>\n&gt; Cariaya, Bard of the 8th circle<br/>\n&gt; Sariaya, Enchanter of the 9th circle<br/>\n&gt; Heart of the Dunedain, Terris-Thule Server<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ariaya@...\">ariaya@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that durn quest will make you nuts, I am not lying...I had 3! BLs <br/>\nfarming them worms at the same time for me and still didn&#39;t get many of <br/>\nthe bile.  FYI, keep the xakra blood you come across too.  Instead of <br/>\nusing the jars to get your skill higher, go to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_pottery2.htm\">http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_pottery2.htm</a>  and use his advice, <br/>\nonly thing I&#39;d change is the first amount of sketches, will probably <br/>\ntake 3 stacks of them to get to trivial on them.  BAM! new master potter <br/>\nafter reading that page for the first time.  Next skill points after 122 <br/>\nwill be tough. 50pp per stack of sketches for large bowls, ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nBookmark eqtraders and look up the quests section for more info on the <br/>\npottery quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\n<br/>\nBebinn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
