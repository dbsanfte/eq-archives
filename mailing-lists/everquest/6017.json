I don&#39;t know why, I guess his dps wasn&#39;t that good. The shaman was ready to leave bc he kept getting aggro and the tank had a hard time taunting off of him for some reason. So I decided to protect the shammy and as soon as the shammy slowed I would stun the mob and run up within melee range and start bashing the hell out of it. I was actually better at getting aggro than the tank. lol. I&#39;ve had to do that for chanters too.
