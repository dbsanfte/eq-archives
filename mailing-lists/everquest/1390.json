She didn&#39;t tell me<br/>\nno to loot my corpse. I went and looted it an hour after talking to her<br/>\n(that&#39;s how long it took me just to get back to my corpse).<br/>\nActually, there is a way they can give you xp without rezzing you. They did<br/>\nit for my mum once when she wasn&#39;t get xp for stuff. They determined that<br/>\nthere was a glitch and gave her xp.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;The worst part was, I lost my level.. and I still<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t gotten back after a week. I lost 3 blue<br/>\n&gt; bubbles of xp. :-( What do you folks think? Should I<br/>\n&gt; repetion?<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I doubt there&#39;s anything a GM can do now.  Since<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve probably looted your corpse completely, they<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t rez you for experience.  That really sucks that<br/>\n&gt; they didn&#39;t get back with you, though.  How long were<br/>\n&gt; you online between talking to the GM and logging out?<br/>\n&gt; Because your petition gets removed from the queue when<br/>\n&gt; you log off your character ... if she was still<br/>\n&gt; looking into it, and you logged, there wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; been anything left for her to do because you weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; online.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Nymue~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; Nymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br/>\n&gt; Wood Elf Druid, Cazic-Thule Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
