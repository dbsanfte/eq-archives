I have a couple<br/>\ncharacters (Mithe on Cathic-Thule and another druid there). Everytime I<br/>\nget to that character selection screen I debate, should I play my ranger<br/>\nor druid. If I play the druid I will greatly fall behind my friends that<br/>\nonly play one character. To solve this I&#39;d love to see /who friends<br/>\navailable from the character selection or server selection screen that<br/>\nway i could tell who was on and on which server. Say I click on<br/>\nCathic-Thule and see my high level friends are not on I could decide to<br/>\nstart a new character on PVP server etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know what you think. If you agree petition or suggest this when<br/>\nonline.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
