It sucks but that is the basics of it.<br/>\nI ran some tests using CoolMon and without anything else loaded EQ alone<br/>\ntook 340 megs of the 512 I had in the test machine. Now I&#39;m sure that<br/>\nwill be different with less RAM For example, with your 384 figure EQ to<br/>\ntake as much of that as possible baring any other apps you may have<br/>\nrunning in the background and what resources Windows is taking up. I<br/>\nwould suggest before you play to close any other apps that may be in the<br/>\nsystem try running in the background. Even better, I don&#39;t know for sure<br/>\nwhat OS your running but In almost all of them you can set up a version<br/>\nto load at startup. I have a version of Win2k that I called GAMING which<br/>\nis just the basic drivers and software I need to load and I get awesome<br/>\ngame play out of it. Plus I don&#39;t have to worry about other apps<br/>\nconflicting with EQ. <br/>\nIn all honesty, your setup is fine. Just try to clear some extra RAM for<br/>\nthe game. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n Message: 10<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2002 08:21:49 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n   From: Rob LeBeau &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">rlebeau65@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: EQ video question<br/>\n<br/>\nI just bought a new machine and have a question.  I<br/>\nhad some Mouse issues but I solved those but now I get<br/>\na little skip in the movement when I run or walk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is like frame by frame.  The machine is a 1.2 GHZ<br/>\nmachine with 384 Ram and 32 MB video card.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my question is, &quot;Does the video card with EQ make<br/>\nthe difference or is it RAM?&quot;  The reason I ask is<br/>\nbecause when you choose the Luclin images it tells you<br/>\nhow many to pick based on Ram and not Video memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo does EQ use RAM more so than Video ram or not?<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind getting a 64 MB video card but I want it<br/>\nto work.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend also sees the same issues but only has 256<br/>\nmb ram<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
