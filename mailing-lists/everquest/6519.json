I&#39;m thinking of making a return to EQ1 as the<br>bug to play seems to have left for the other game....tooo many kids<br>and it&#39;s becoming a job. I remember many sleepless nights exploring<br>Norath,\n Grinding with others on the plains of Karana and actually<br>enjoying it. Anyone still out there? I&#39;ve looked at the forum activity<br>and wasn&#39;t very hopeful, but the game looks to be active as far as<br>current expansions and whatnot.<br><br></div></div></blockquote><br><p>&#32;\n      <hr size=\"1\">Luggage?
