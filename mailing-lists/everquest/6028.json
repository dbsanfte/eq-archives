I seen a 65 cleric with epic who couldnt cast before oom. most <br/>\nthe time however power lvling is done by experanced players. I have a <br/>\nfriend who plays to about lvl 30 before deleting and starting <br/>\nanother, he enjoys going from lvl 1 to lvl 30 in a day.  It took all <br/>\ni  could do to make him play one to 65.  Dont get ripped on power <br/>\nlvling.  When you have a lvl 70 with everything under the sun, I <br/>\ndoubt you will want to sit lfg for 9 hours with a lvl 25 necro. Iam <br/>\nknow lvl 51 and still see very few groups as the servers have fewer <br/>\npeople on.  As far as doing it naked its all about where you go and <br/>\nskill in doing it, have done it a few times and i know how. I think <br/>\nyou may enjoy a druid so you will have the power to group power lvl <br/>\nand solo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Steven R.
