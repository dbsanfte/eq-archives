Could someone<br>&gt; suggest a \n  similar zone/area with good experience and average to good loot<br>&gt; where \n  I could hunt fairly safely, either in a group or solo?<br><br>You can try \n  going inside Paw (I was actually hunting in Paw from 25 to about<br>30, \n  altough you can hunt in Paw longer than that).<br><br>After that, I went to RM \n  to hunt HGs and spent some time in Crystal Caverns.<br>I basically did 30-40 \n  in RM, CC, OT and Eastern Wastes (with a couple<br>unsuccessful trips to Tower \n  of the Frozen Shadow).<br><br>I would make sure that you get as much \n  experience dungeons as you can<br>though.&nbsp; LGuk and SolB (along with CC) \n  are good places to try to find a<br>group.&nbsp; I did some hunting in SolA at \n  30, but you really need to go deep to<br>get good XP \n  there.<br><br>Sulamwen<br>Half Elf Pathfinder<br>E&#39;ci<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
