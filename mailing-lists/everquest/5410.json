None of the skills I get<br/>\nit on are ever over 100.  Is there a limit to how high a skill can go based<br/>\non level, or is it based on something else?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about my Iksar Monk and my Human Paladin.  The Iksar has a<br/>\nnegative modifier to exp, the Human has a positive one.  Both are at the<br/>\nsame level now and my Iksar has higher skill numbers for Offense, Defense<br/>\nand his primary fighting skills and could easily take my Pal in a fight.  I<br/>\nwas thinking that making the Iksar advance slower is bad in that it takes<br/>\nlonger to get access to more powerful skills, but good in that it takes more<br/>\nfighting to get to the same point, and more fighting means more skills<br/>\nadvancement.  If those facts are correct, I would rather have the negative<br/>\nmodifier.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
