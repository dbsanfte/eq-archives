Heart pounds, pulse rate goes up, I even get the shakes <br/>\nsometimes. I seldom get that in real life, even though I have a job <br/>\nthat requires occasional physical combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this game!<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto of Rivervale.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., LeSamLam@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; As far as I know, there&#39;s only the port to the Dreadlands.
