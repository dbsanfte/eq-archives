And once you have done your time in <br/>\nMeru Seru you can head over to Dawn Shroud Peaks.  You go straight <br/>\nat the big junction rather than right coming from the nexus.  That <br/>\nshould take you in to you mid to late 30&#39;s...If i remember right.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarudore,<br/>\nBTW, great choice of a new class for ya.

But if you have LDON  at level 20 try to get groups <br/>\nin <br/>\n&gt; there.. not bad loot and great exp and fun..

In my previous EQ days ( I quit right after PoP <br/>\ncame <br/>\n&gt; &gt; out) I played strictly melee characters....had a 57th lvl Barb <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Warrior, and a 59th lvl Hum Monk. I got tired of the endless <br/>\n&gt; &gt; searching for groups, and the seeming HUGE overload of really <br/>\nwell <br/>\n&gt; &gt; equipped melees on my server (Tunare) so this time around I <br/>\n&gt; decided <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to go with a high demand class, and finally, after much <br/>\n&gt; &gt; consideration, I decided to play the class I most loved duoing <br/>\n&gt; with <br/>\n&gt; &gt; as a monk, the Shaman. I rolled up a Barb Shaman with my new EQ <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Evolutions software, and -pop- there I was, back in Halas again <br/>\n&gt; after <br/>\n&gt; &gt; nearly a yeas absence. A lot of things came back to me, and <br/>\nwithin <br/>\n&gt; a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; couple of hours, I hit lvl 5, got my new spells, and then I hit <br/>\na <br/>\n&gt; &gt; brick wall. Non of my old friends seem to be around anymore, so <br/>\nI <br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have them to ask for advice, so I turned to this group for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; help. I have been told Steamfront is the best place to go to lvl <br/>\n&gt; up a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; shammy for the next few cycles anyway...any thoughts on this? I <br/>\nam <br/>\n&gt; &gt; not looking to necessarily powerlevel, though I do miss the high <br/>\n&gt; end <br/>\n&gt; &gt; raiding, pulling in Kael , the 12 hour raids in HoT in ToV, etc <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; would like to get back to those, but I am willing to put in the <br/>\n&gt; time <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to learn this classes ins and outs, and make myself an integral <br/>\n&gt; part <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of any group I join. So any help with where to level, etc would <br/>\nbe <br/>\n&gt; &gt; great, since it has been since early 2001 that I was a newbie <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; &gt; first time.........and the old haunts seem to be deserted now. I <br/>\n&gt; do <br/>\n&gt; &gt; like the new transport systems, made getting out of Halas much <br/>\n&gt; easier <br/>\n&gt; &gt; than it was with my warrior ( the run to Freeport with a lvl 5 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; nightblind warrior in cloth armor was harrowing lol) ...also if <br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone has a main or an alt on Tunare that would like to group <br/>\n&gt; with a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; n00b shammy and help him get the hang of it all, send a tell to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karudore  ..... see you all soon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karudore - lvl 5 Barb n00b shammy, Tunare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; R.I.P.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karudor (warrior)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kerudor (monk)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I miss you guys !!!!!!!! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
