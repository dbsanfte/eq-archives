It was fun<br/>\nstarting as a Barbarian shaman and warrior team then we moved to a Wood<br/>\nElf druid and ranger team.  I&#39;m amazed even though I&#39;m 10 yrs older how<br/>\nmuch I have learned from him about gaming.  He&#39;s hooked on WWII Online<br/>\nlately, but thats okay since I need to level a bit to catchup with him<br/>\nagain :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-mac<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 18 May 2001, Jackie wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also play with family members....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son and his wife both play EQ...

She has recently got a computer and<br/>\n&gt; bought EQ. So now we have started playing together. This is the first<br/>\n&gt; thing we have had in common in 20 years. A little weird to be killing<br/>\n&gt; orcs with your sister but cool.
