How often you want raids<br/>\nand such. Do you allow powerleving? Are any races/classes excluded?<br/>\nThen play the game. If you spot someone who is guildless who you really<br/>\nenjoy playing with and you think would fit well in your guild (and if they<br/>\nare in the right level range) keep an eye on them. If you find that all or<br/>\nmost of your encounters with the person are enjoyable you might want them to<br/>\njoin. Some guilds have a trial or probation period in which they watch that<br/>\nperson and the person must be on best behavior. After the probation is up<br/>\nand the person has proved to be good in the guild, their alts are allowed.<br/>\nI&#39;d say a big rule of thumb is to be available in case members need to speak<br/>\nto you. Especially in disciplinary matters. If someone in your guild does<br/>\nsomething that makes your guild look bad, investigate. Find out if they are<br/>\njust being jerks, or if someone is lying. There&#39;s alot of responsibility<br/>\nwith it. You also get to assign officers and such. And maybe plan raids.<br/>\nOk, I&#39;m babbling now so I&#39;ll shut up.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hail and well met.
