There is no better place from 15-25.  You can<br/>\nlevel 3 times in a few hours of consistent good play. <br/>\nOnly thing is, get yourself someone who can cure<br/>\nDisease because Creeping Crud is a bad bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, you can do Oasis until 18 or head to the High<br/>\nHold Pass, which is hard to find a group because of<br/>\npaludal but still is good.
