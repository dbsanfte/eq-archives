I soloed him form<br/>\nlvl 1 to lvl 10 which took me about a total of 24 hours (most of that time I<br/>\nwas working on my curscale armor).  Form there I went form lvl 10 to lvl 16<br/>\nin Kurn&#39;s Tower that took me about 6 hours game time in group.  Then from<br/>\nlvl 16 to 22 which I accomplished in roughly 3 hours in Paludal Caverns<br/>\nbouncing back and forth between  B1 and B2.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all that I am also helping form a new guild on the Starpyre and once we<br/>\nget approved by SOE we will be called Raiders of the Twilight.
