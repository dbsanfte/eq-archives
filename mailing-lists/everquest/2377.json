You are already way ahead having someone in your <br/>\nlife also sharing your virtual life. In that way you can play without <br/>\nneglecting someone, but infact bond with them in a very special way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, I am on the Zeb server, so our hails will have to be here. <br/>\nThis is a good list, and much fellowship and advice shall be found <br/>\nhere. It is a little slow here right now, but has it&#39;s busy periods.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a halfling druid as my primary. Lvl 30. I am also a halfling <br/>\nwarrior, lvl 8, and a gnome magician, lvl 3. I have worked my primary <br/>\nmost of the time, but now am attending a bit more to my alts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to ask questions here. This is a great place to share <br/>\nadventures, get advice, and share what you have learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nHalfling Druid<br/>\nZeb server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;masterkiis_nara&quot; &lt;masterkiis_nara@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I am really new at the game (have been playing only about a <br/>\n&gt; month)...i am on the Ayonae Ro server with a couple of characters <br/>\n&gt; (lvl 9 Barb Warrior and lvl 5 Cleric...told you I was new...LOL) <br/>\nWas <br/>\n&gt; just curious if anyone else in on that server...usually am hunting <br/>\n&gt; with the love of my life who is teaching me the game but would be <br/>\nfun <br/>\n&gt; to pass a friendly &quot;Hail&quot; to those here on the list should our <br/>\npaths <br/>\n&gt; cross...would that be proper and acceptable EQ etiquette??
