They have patched it but it still breaks, though less<br/>\n&gt; &gt; often.  But it is fun!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you want to increase your brewing cheaply just gather Payala fruit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in Shadeweaver Thicket and combine it with water.  It&#39;s a ground drop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so anyone can find it.  Just look for the blue topped trees.  It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; makes Shar Val essence, triv at 180+.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heh. Got my brewing to 184 so far. :-)<br/>\n&gt; A couple months ago I practiced going around the trees in the zone and got<br/>\n&gt; it down so that by the time I got back to the starting point the fruit<br/>\n&gt; repopped. Got lots of lots of the payala fruit.<br/>\n&gt; Is Shar Vahl essence good for anything? I have tons of it.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
