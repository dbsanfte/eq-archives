You enter the Grounds of Fate, turn right before entering the PVP<br/>\narea and go up the ramp. At the top turn left and follow the elevated<br/>\nwalkway to the building at the other end. Go inside and turn to the left.<br/>\nCaptain Tillin is standing outside on the balcony.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe aware that turning in gnoll fangs to him lowers your faction with the<br/>\nCorrupt Qeynos Guards. My level 41 druid is KOS to the Corrupt Qeynos Guards<br/>\nnow. Every time he has entered North Qeynos, even in wolf form, Lieutenant<br/>\nDagarok has killed him. I will say that you would have to turn in a LOT of<br/>\ngnoll fangs though.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;muaddib74447&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:muaddib1974@...\">muaddib1974@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 07, 2002 7:12 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] I have a question about a quest!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;   I need to know if someone can help me out or send me to a web site.<br/>\n&gt; I am a paladin of Karana, and I was told to talk to Captain Tillin<br/>\n&gt; about gnolls of Blackburrow.
