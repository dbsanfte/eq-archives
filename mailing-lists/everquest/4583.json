I did the Stein Quest twice today. Cast Illusion:DE<br/>\n&gt; on my Lvl 14 Erudite Enchanter, and cast Alliance on Clurg. I conned<br/>\n&gt; Clurg as Amiable both times. Both times I said &quot;What special book&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; he replied, and I gave him the compodium. Then he said something<br/>\n&gt; like &quot;You must have worked hard to get my book, I am indebted to you.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like being indebted, so take this as payment&quot;. He didn&#39;t give<br/>\n&gt; me anything; no PP, no stein. I petitioned the GM. Does anyone have a<br/>\n&gt; clue as to what is going on?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
