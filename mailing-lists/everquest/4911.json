At present, there is little motivation to craft unless you<br/>\nhave a gaming predilection to do things like that. At present, by the<br/>\ntime you have leveled up enough to aquire materials, plus leveled your<br/>\ncrafting, the items you make aren&#39;t as good as what you can hunt or buy. <br/>\n<br/>\nA real in-game economy would add to the fun. Especially if it would be<br/>\ngood even for casual gamers. I can&#39;t always find the time to play<br/>\nenough to level and aquire stuff in ways which seem economical. There<br/>\nshould be provision for a good gaming experience even for very casual<br/>\ngamers. <br/>\n<br/>\nBarto<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Ok, we know they are adding vases, coffins, and chests that can be<br/>\nopened or<br/>\n&gt; smashed into the game with Lost Dungeons of Norrath, but are there<br/>\nany other<br/>\n&gt; features you would like to see added to Everquest?<br/>\n&gt; Or, if you could go back in time and change something about<br/>\nEverquest during<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s creation to have certain features, what would you have done<br/>\n&gt; differently?<br/>\n&gt; Feel free to go into detail if you want. :-)<br/>\n&gt; (I&#39;m extremely bored bc I injured my wrists and can&#39;t play EQ much for<br/>\n&gt; awhile)<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; Baron Conwyn Collyrium lvl 56 epic cleric, officer of The Spellbinders<br/>\n&gt; The Tribunal server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
