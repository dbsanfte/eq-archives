A gift for the family. <br/>\nIt was a mid-range system at that time, though I did not know that <br/>\nthe 256k memory limit would make it low-end so quickly. I added a 3d <br/>\ncard at about six months, not knowing that the standard was moving <br/>\nahead so fast. With the knowledge I now have, I may have scraped up a <br/>\nbit more and bought higher end, but it was not then a good economic <br/>\nmove.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be adding enough memory in a few weeks to bring my system up <br/>\nto it&#39;s 256k max. I ordered sol in the summer, with the expectation <br/>\nthat the 128k minimum would be in place when released. I found that <br/>\nmy max would now be the new minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs is the system is nominally playable. With the new memory and <br/>\npossibly a new graphics card (fortunately the cost of a gforce 2 has <br/>\ndropped to an easily reachable level) the machine will serve. I <br/>\nexpect Sony/V will make improvements in the game to keep lower end <br/>\nplayers viable for some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I must plan to upgrade hardware and catch up, perhaps pull ahead <br/>\nof the curve a bit so I am not always catching up.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I am not able to scrape up the $4k bucks for a real <br/>\nkick-ass system like I see in the magazines. I will probably see what <br/>\na new tower with lots of memory, a gforce 3 and a good sized hard <br/>\ndrive will cost me, and begin saving in hopes of getting it online <br/>\nbefore this system gets too old to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of us on the lower end, we must hope Sony/V wants our bucks <br/>\nenough to keep us alive a bit longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
