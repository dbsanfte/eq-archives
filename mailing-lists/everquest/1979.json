I<br/>\nwant to go and visit EVERY Old World zone again. I was running through<br/>\nDagnor&#39;s Cauldron and I could not believe they made a very ugly plain zone<br/>\nlook so beautiful. I mean I thought this zone was just grayish rocks with<br/>\nwater in the middle. Well, not now. It looks so very good. I now want to go<br/>\nto every zone just to view the scenery. <br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I got a new computer just for the SoL. I had an old W95, 300 MHz, 256<br/>\nRAM that ran the Old World ok, but now with my new PC, wow, what a change. I<br/>\nhave P4 1.7 MHz, 80 gig HD, 512 RAM, geforce 3 400 and run this on a DSL<br/>\nthat downloads around 1,200 kbs and uploads ~ 800 kbs. Last night in the SoL<br/>\nI was zoning in 20-30 seconds ( glad they fixed this yesterday ) and very<br/>\nlittle to no lag. The ping bar looked good all night, with left side max<br/>\naround 200 and staying in double digits and on the EQ side around 2,000 max.<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t be happier with SoL. I can understand Verant wanting to get the<br/>\nproduct out on time, but I can also see the customer side. But I would have<br/>\nbeen happy enough just with the new zone graphics and the new AA experience.<br/>\nThis new experience really offers the +51 player a lot of cool skill to<br/>\nshoot for.<br/>\n<br/>\njeff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tWhitmore, Lance [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lwhitmore@...\">lwhitmore@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tTuesday, December 11, 2001 2:29 PM<br/>\n\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\tSubject:\tRE: [EverQuest] Re: I hate Shadows of Luclin and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t even own it yet...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt has nothing to do with a low res version of Vah Shir model.  In<br/>\nfact that<br/>\n\tis in the game now.  With the SoL expansion you can set it on a low<br/>\nres<br/>\n\tversion of the entire game or high if you choose to ( that includes<br/>\nboth<br/>\n\tgame world and player models ).  The whole problem here is when<br/>\nMicrosoft<br/>\n\tmade a majority of video cards obsolete with the release of directx<br/>\n8..<br/>\n\tPERIOD...  Everquest is over 3 years old now.  When it was first<br/>\nreleased<br/>\n\tDirectx was in release 6.  Since then with the introduction of<br/>\nKunark and<br/>\n\tVelious, players were required to upgrade to release 7.  Directx 7<br/>\nmade<br/>\n\tminor improvements to 6, however, didn&#39;t require changes to the home<br/>\nusers<br/>\n\tPC.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tIf you have Luclin you can immediately see the improvements in<br/>\ngraphics.. It<br/>\n\tlooks absolutely great.  Problem is for a game that&#39;s been out so<br/>\nlong they<br/>\n\tneed to keep up with the release schedule of Microsoft&#39;s DirectX.<br/>\nWith the<br/>\n\tintroduction of WindowsXP they ( they being Microsoft ) introduced a<br/>\nnew<br/>\n\trelease version 8.  Everquest is a game that has gone through 3<br/>\ndifferent<br/>\n\tversions of directx in order to keep up with the visual quality that<br/>\never<br/>\n\tother game out there has had the luxury of not having to contend<br/>\nwith.  I<br/>\n\tguarantee that if any other game out there attempted to provide the<br/>\n\tenhancements and a quality product that incorporated the latest<br/>\nvideo<br/>\n\tstandards they would be experiencing the same problem.  Do you see<br/>\nany other<br/>\n\tcompany even attempting to release a updated DirectX 8 version?<br/>\nReturn to<br/>\n\tCastle Wolfenstein was released and is a DirectX 8 only product that<br/>\n\tincorporates the same technology improvements.  You will, however,<br/>\nnever see<br/>\n\ta DirectX 9 version... Nor will they be supporting the same program<br/>\n3 years<br/>\n\tfrom now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHehe.. Computer technology changes every few months.. If your still<br/>\nusing<br/>\n\tthe same computer you had 3 years ago, its probably time to upgrade.<br/>\nAh<br/>\n\twell.. Its Christmas :)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tD<br/>\n<br/>\n\t------------------------ Yahoo!
