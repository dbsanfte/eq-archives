He even sat on one of the corpses so I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nloot it. I had to threaten to petition his ass for him to go away.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi everyone!<br/>\n&gt;   What is up with the kill stealing? I&#39;ve had it<br/>\n&gt; happen to me several times where I was soloing and<br/>\n&gt; after killing several creatures, (Getting attacked one<br/>\n&gt; right after another), I&#39;ll find that while I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; fighting off an attacker my other kills have been<br/>\n&gt; stolen. Sometimes I&#39;ll even see them do it. Granted<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve gone up to some other players kills after a time<br/>\n&gt; mistaking it for one of mine but I mean blatently<br/>\n&gt; going up and stealing a kill right in front of the<br/>\n&gt; original player?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That really sucks!<br/>\n&gt; C-ya!<br/>\n&gt; Steve<br/>\n&gt; (A.K.A Durgaa, Shizney, Printor, Ahlannah)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Make international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
