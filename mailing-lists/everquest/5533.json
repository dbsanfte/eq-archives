Finally somebody else who plays on Tarew Marr server. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t really experienced the LDoN problems that you&#39;re talking about,<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t tend to do many LDoN adventures anymore unless friends are<br/>\nonline. Then, even if it&#39;s just three of us, we might just do an adventure<br/>\nwithout recruiting a full team (we win about 3/4 of the time with a<br/>\nthree-person team, but certain types of adventures are nearly impossible,<br/>\nlike assassinations).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest complaint is the insistence of far too many players that an LDoN<br/>\ngroup absolutely needs a cleric in the mix. I&#39;ve wasted more hours than I<br/>\ncare to count sitting there with a perfectly-suitable five-person group just<br/>\nbecause the group refuses to budge without a cleric. Not fun at all. X(<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if you want, look me up on Tarew Marr server. My main, a 45th level<br/>\nranger, is named Crispinus.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cary Benford [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wishbear22@...\">wishbear22@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: January 28, 2004 11:29 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] New person to the list not new to EQ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello all!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought I would introduce myself. My name is<br/>\nCary. I&#39;m 25 years old married. Both my husband and I<br/>\nplay EQ. He is the one that got me hooked.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Characters:<br/>\nVenetia Valgrave - Lvl 43 Ench High elf - Currently<br/>\ngaining exp to dungeon groups and not liking it<br/>\n<br/>\nClawdya Valgrave Lvl 23 - Beastlord Kitty - Currently<br/>\nin PC<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on the the Tarew Marr server with my husband<br/>\nMorrdak Valgrave who is a lvl 52 Iksar SK. Also a<br/>\nbunch of My RL friends play on that server. We all<br/>\nhave the family name of Valgrave. Its pretty funny.<br/>\nHehe<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to level to 46 as quickly as possible so I<br/>\ncan level in POJ with my friends who are in their 50&#39;s<br/>\nnow. It sucks not being able to level with them. The<br/>\nDungeon groups suck because everybody is sooo rude and<br/>\nI have been jipped out of split 4 times now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I just thought I would introduce myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nCary</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
