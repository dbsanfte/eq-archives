The drawbacks:<br/>\n&gt; Good races<br/>\n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want to kill you. If<br/>\n&gt; you play a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally suck but you get<br/>\n&gt; pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cool armor when you can manage to find all the stuff you need for<br/>\n&gt; it. People<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they think of tanks. They don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; often<br/>\n&gt; &gt; invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they get the spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon a pet to tank<br/>\n&gt; for you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, and you get a<br/>\n&gt; spell that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can solo alot and are a<br/>\n&gt; good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; asset to a group. Way later in the game you get to summon your own<br/>\n&gt; horse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; called an Unholy Steed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My brother started a shadowknight and got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
