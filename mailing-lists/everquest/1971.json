Also clean your phone jacks but do not use<br/>\n&gt;water. :-)<br/>\n&gt;Sometimes just pulling out the phone line and plugging it back in to the<br/>\n&gt;jack can help improve the connection.<br/>\n&gt;I personally went to the trouble of getting special phone cords just for<br/>\n&gt;modems. They were about $12 for 15 feet of cable. They really helped my<br/>\n&gt;connection. They are much thicker than normal phone cords. There are also<br/>\n&gt;some cords that have special coating to sheild them from electrical<br/>\n&gt;discharge. Oh, magnets can screw up connections too. Anything with<br/>\n&gt;electrical or magnetic (or both) fields can disrupt internet connections.<br/>\n&gt;Radios, speakers, and fans are common culprits. Even phones have magnetism.<br/>\n&gt;That is why you should never ever ever set your phone down on a floppy disk<br/>\n&gt;unless you want the disk erased.<br/>\n&gt;Ok, I&#39;ll shut up for real now.<br/>\n&gt;luv,<br/>\n&gt;-Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
