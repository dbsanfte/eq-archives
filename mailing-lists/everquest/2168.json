It is sometimes hard to get on the list<br/>\nbut if you are playing a desirable class (one that they would want in group)<br/>\nthen it&#39;s easier. If you&#39;re above 25 you can go with a group into the<br/>\nWarrior room in Highpass.<br/>\nAs for 29.. I think the Sarnak Fort in Lake of Ill Omens is ok. Best to have<br/>\na group. Just be prepared to get a LOT of requests for sow. People are<br/>\nalways shouting for sow. Shamans and druids are very sought after. As are<br/>\nthe elusive clerics. (there never seem to be clerics around when people want<br/>\nthem).  Groups looking for a healer will sometimes settle for a druid<br/>\ninstead of a cleric.<br/>\nThe only zones I hunted in were Lake of Ill Omens, Frontier Mts, and The<br/>\nOverthere. I didn&#39;t spend much time in OT. I spent most of the time in LoIO.<br/>\nSo I recommend there as a good starting place. Even at 35 there are some<br/>\nmobs that still yield xp.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Thanks for the info. I will run by Highpass and purchase a bit of ore<br/>\n&gt; to try out. See just how hard hunting my own will be. I might be wise<br/>\n&gt; to postpone the visit to Kunark for a few more levels, from what I<br/>\n&gt; have read here. I am sure I can find something useful to do for a few<br/>\n&gt; levels. Any suggestions for possible good zones in Kunark to work<br/>\n&gt; through those levels? Might be good to do my leveling there after<br/>\n&gt; all. Once I have a Kunark bind point I can move back and forth<br/>\n&gt; quickly enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any higher level tailors out there? I am lvl 70 in tailoring, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; working toward making Halfling tailored and imbued armor.

I am<br/>\n&gt; soon to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be off to Kunark to obtain my brute hides. Anyone been a brute<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hunter, who can give me any advice?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; High quality ore drops off of pickclaw warriors and raiders in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Highpass/Highkeep (I can never keep it straight which is called<br/>\n&gt; which). You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would need a group at your level. Since you are a druid, people<br/>\n&gt; would really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want you in group there. Sow can be cast. And if you have regen and<br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beneficial spells they will love you. Especially since you can<br/>\n&gt; heal. If you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have coin to spend, go to highkeep and auction to buy high quality<br/>\n&gt; ore.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are usually some players who will part with it. I think the<br/>\n&gt; small<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bricks go for around 5pp and the large bricks around 10pp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You too!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
