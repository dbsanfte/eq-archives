I&#39;m having trouble with part of it that requires Mossy Rat Pelts. I have obtained several Ruined and undamaged rat pelts but no plain ol&#39; mossy. All the research I have done seems to suggest the diseased rats drop these so I have been hunting them for about a week now and no pelts. Does anyone know if they do drop them, if they are rare, no-drop and such? Any info would be greatly appriciated. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n-- <br/>\n__________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\">http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMeet Singles<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://corp.mail.com/lavalife\">http://corp.mail.com/lavalife</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
