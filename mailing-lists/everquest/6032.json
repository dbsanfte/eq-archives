I have a friend that has<br/>\n&gt; joined because of me <br/>\n&gt; and we did a little PL&#39;ing of him. However I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; go full bore but <br/>\n&gt; more like &quot;helped&quot; him in some areas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tAs of late I haven&#39;t had to much trouble finding<br/>\n&gt; groups between 20 and <br/>\n&gt; 40. But this may be a server thing. (I wonder if<br/>\n&gt; there are more of a <br/>\n&gt; certain level on some servers than others?) I do run<br/>\n&gt; into times when I <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t find a darn thing and it sucks but then I just<br/>\n&gt; go work on <br/>\n&gt; tradeskills (Like alcohol tolerance!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI still say you had to have &quot;some&quot; armor on! LOL<br/>\n&gt; j/k and yes Druids do <br/>\n&gt; rock.

I seen a 65 cleric with epic who couldnt<br/>\n&gt; cast before oom. most <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the time however power lvling is done by<br/>\n&gt; experanced players. I have a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; friend who plays to about lvl 30 before deleting<br/>\n&gt; and starting <br/>\n&gt; &gt; another, he enjoys going from lvl 1 to lvl 30 in a<br/>\n&gt; day.  It took all <br/>\n&gt; &gt; i  could do to make him play one to 65.  Dont get<br/>\n&gt; ripped on power <br/>\n&gt; &gt; lvling.  When you have a lvl 70 with everything<br/>\n&gt; under the sun, I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; doubt you will want to sit lfg for 9 hours with a<br/>\n&gt; lvl 25 necro. Iam <br/>\n&gt; &gt; know lvl 51 and still see very few groups as the<br/>\n&gt; servers have fewer <br/>\n&gt; &gt; people on.  As far as doing it naked its all about<br/>\n&gt; where you go and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill in doing it, have done it a few times and i<br/>\n&gt; know how. I think <br/>\n&gt; &gt; you may enjoy a druid so you will have the power<br/>\n&gt; to group power lvl <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and solo.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nDress up your holiday email, Hollywood style.
