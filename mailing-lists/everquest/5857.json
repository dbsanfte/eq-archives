I was playing before them and <br/>\nremember when we wanted someone to tank who could hold aggro we&#39;d look for a <br/>\npaladin or shadow knight since warriors would have problems keeping aggro <br/>\nwith all the casters nuking.  Sony added the disciplines as a way to boost <br/>\nthe melees abilities so they could compete with the hybrids.  Adding taunts <br/>\nand health regen discs are availible to even level 10 melees while the real <br/>\npowerhouse discs start in the 50s.  The introduction of this system also <br/>\nchanged how to activate the disciplines.  Before you automatically got them <br/>\nat the right level, butnow you have to buy the tomes and hand them to your <br/>\ntrainer to get the skill.  The original 4 are only 2 copper each but the <br/>\nnewer ones cost a lot more.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
