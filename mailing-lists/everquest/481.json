But what is use of this very important<br/>\n&gt;feature in game?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nearly nonexistent unfortunatly only some magic users use it for reading<br/>\n&gt;some lost magic books in long lost languages and nothing more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In all citys merchants speak common, people in remonte huts talk common,<br/>\n&gt;trolls talk common, elfs a nobile and arrogant race talk common you can go<br/>\n&gt;in every city and every place and all shop vendors speak common ALL PLAYERS<br/>\n&gt;talk perfect common also. So all other languages are nearly never used !!<br/>\n&gt;Why to waste this valuable resurce ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What we can do,  as now in Verant they have under work a new race war<br/>\n&gt;server it will be nice to include this option in new code and enchant this<br/>\n&gt;interesting new idea!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My points to change<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1.) I think that some MAX knowelege based on inteligence and wisdom for any<br/>\n&gt;language can be imposted so that you can learn max awaful in dragon if you<br/>\n&gt;have inteligence under 60. It is very strange to have a Troll wich speak<br/>\n&gt;fluent and with melodic elf language or read a long lost book writen in<br/>\n&gt;combine language.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2.) all city vendors speak a local language and some rare speak also common<br/>\n&gt;in some degre. In some citys arogant high elfs can speak only their<br/>\n&gt;languages and will not hear any of  beast races languages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3.) All players start with a race language based on total inteligence and<br/>\n&gt;wisdom and common in some degre but not at maximum. On base of class i will<br/>\n&gt;add some rare aditional languages but only for casters some base of<br/>\n&gt;languages at wich are writen a basic spell books.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4.) all aditional lv of spells can be only writen if you have enough<br/>\n&gt;knowelege in language on wich a scroll is writen. This can create a<br/>\n&gt;traduction skills to translate spells from one language to another and so<br/>\n&gt;on. Some paterns instructions can be in a specific language.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5.) In spell research you must have a tome with instruction in one hand and<br/>\n&gt;a combine book in another and to create new spell is checked not only your<br/>\n&gt;skill but also a language knowelege for language in wich is writen a book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;6.) Npc will nor reply on your questions or trade with you if you dont know<br/>\n&gt;a language enough<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This are only some of possible uses of languages and there are many more im<br/>\n&gt;shure that some can be easily implemented right from start and others will<br/>\n&gt;require much work and maybe will not enter in game untio a everquest 2 but<br/>\n&gt;i think that here is hiden posibility to make a new profondity to this<br/>\n&gt;great game .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Silverion<br/>\n&gt;High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt;Fenin Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
