I&#39;m paying for 56k but can&#39;t get it bc of my phonelines. Rather than<br/>\ngiving me a full phone line like everyone else in town has, they spliced<br/>\nmine with all of the other lines in the area. Basically they just cut the<br/>\nline and split it into little parts. The less bandwidth you have, the less<br/>\nphones you can use. So if I pick up one phone while another is off the hook,<br/>\none of them won&#39;t work. and I am supposed to be able to have up to 4 phones<br/>\non the same line.<br/>\nDrives me nuts!<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is terrible, I can&#39;t get DSL or Cable, but I am fortunate enough to<br/>\nhave 56k. I used to have 26k too when the game first came out and it seemed<br/>\nto work ok.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Su<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, April 06, 2002 7:52 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] hello<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oops.

Isn&#39;t that a little excessive? Do you know if the 1.5 Ghz<br/>\n  Duron has been released yet? I always double everything when it is<br/>\n  availiable. I have a 750 Duron now and 512MB of ram. I guess I need to get<br/>\na<br/>\n  1.5Ghz Duron, 1GB or ram and what ever video card is relatively cheap<br/>\nright<br/>\n  now, guess ill have to do some research on that.
