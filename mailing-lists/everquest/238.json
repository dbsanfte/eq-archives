I have a Pentium2 with 300Mhz and 128MB and a V.90 modem and it takes me 30 seconds to load.  The only difference between our two rigs is his cable modem.  He zones 3 to 6 times faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Swedish post said he took less than a minute.  I&#39;ll read that as 50 seconds not 5 to ten.  That&#39;s almost twice as slow as me.  He said he has and AMD K6 300 Mhz - didn&#39;t mention memory - so either he has less memory than me - or it&#39;s the additional hops from Sweden than the US.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example:<br/>\n?have a amd 400mhz 64mb of ps100 ram   16mb video card-banshee<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and an awesome creative 128bit sound card. however i have NEVER zoned in<br/>\n&gt;less than a minute, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is faster than my machine, but less memory - zones slower than me - looks like memory is an issue too!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is BOTH bandwidth AND system speed dependent.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Whitmore, Lance <br/>\n  To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 07, 1999 8:42 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] zoning<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  How can it be dependent on bandwidth..  my brother has a p3 450 with a 28.8 connetion.. he loads faster than me using a p2-333.  and the guy from sweden only takes 8-10 secs. to load..  i think Shane had an interesting comment..  how much extra drive space do you have.. i remember that the installation instructions stated that there is a requirement for a minnimum of 150 mb.  Any load times about 30sec between zones is highly unusal. Youve got a problem that goes beyond our disscusion.  Like i said before the data that is sent to your machine at anytime is quite compact and requires very little transfer time. Its system dependent when reference to load times.. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Lance <br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message----- <br/>\n  From: Shannon Upham [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shannon@...\">shannon@...</a>] <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 07, 1999 8:34 AM <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] zoning <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: &quot;Shannon Upham&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shannon@...\">shannon@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  It must be dependant on bandwidth more than anything else.
