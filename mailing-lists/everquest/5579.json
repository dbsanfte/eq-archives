I have found them helpful in the past.  But I can not find <br/>\nthe &quot;Gargoyle Island in Ocean of Tears&quot;.  I visited the Ocean of <br/>\nTears and gone to every island but did not find one as described <br/>\nhere.  Do any of you know weather this is a bad tip, old info or did <br/>\nI just miss this island?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Gargoyle Island in Ocean of Tears. Get a level or two, plus 60-80 <br/>\ngargoyle eyes here in a few days to a week of hunting and earn <br/>\nyourself a cool 500-700pp or more. The eyes sell for 9pp each. The <br/>\nthing to note with Garg Isle is that there are gargoyles and <br/>\nskeletons. Kill a garg, a skel will spawn, and visa versa. Keep <br/>\nkilling the skeletons or no gargs will spawn! Also, some monks find <br/>\nit fun to get a train of skels then run up to a garg, feign and let <br/>\nthe skels fight the garg down until the skels are dead, then pop up <br/>\nand finish the garg. It works well, but I found it more efficient to <br/>\nsimply kill the gargs. This is also the place to learn to run around <br/>\nin zoomed out mode. Hit F9 four times, zoom it all the way out and <br/>\nthen run around the isle. Takes some getting used to, but it&#39;s the <br/>\nonly way to go to spot the gargs when they spawn. This is a lonely <br/>\nfew levels, but the money is worth it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks <br/>\nRobert</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
