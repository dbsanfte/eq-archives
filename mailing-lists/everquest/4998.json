Half of<br/>\nthe xp you subsequently earn goes to paying of the debt rather than<br/>\nincreasing your current xp. If you log then the debt gets reduced over<br/>\ntime. After a day or so it is all gone. Thats how it worked in Earth &<br/>\nBeyond (the only other mmorpg I have played). It seemed reasonably fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t lose levels or skills, and could still gain xp while paying<br/>\noff the debt, but if you died repeatedly you could just say what the<br/>\nheck, log for the night, and the next day your debt would be gone. If<br/>\nyou only logged for a few hours only part of your debt would have gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.512 / Virus Database: 309 - Release Date: 19/08/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
