I&#39;m part beta program, however i rarely<br/>\nplay it now.. its neat when you first start playing.. then you find out that<br/>\nthe game just sucks.. :)  cant put it any other way.  Graphics are ok.. but<br/>\nthe world is so large and the distance between them is almost unbearable.<br/>\nIts really annoying running for what seems forever, then losing your best<br/>\nitem you spent all your loot on miles from where you last bound yourself.<br/>\nHehe..  The AC world is so empty, almost as empty as their dungeons. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those that don&#39;t know.. when you die in AC you temporary lose some of<br/>\nyour stat numbers and..  your best item.   This item.. which is now<br/>\navailable to anyone walking by.  nice aye.  EQ example...  One minute you<br/>\nhave your rubi tunic, when you return to your corpse you find that a level 1<br/>\nguy is now sporting your hard earned tunic.. Welcome to AC. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Shane Bole [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 2:57 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Fed up with EQ - any ideas??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Shane Bole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAC and UO both suck ass.

They&#39;re constantly nerfing everything<br/>\ningame<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s worth while, or ignoring classes that need to be balanced or<br/>\n&gt; upgraded! So in retrospect, I&#39;m looking to find greener pastures<br/>\nelsewhere.<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps someone out there knows of another game (other than AC and UO) or<br/>\n&gt; perhaps a group who&#39;s programming their own game similar to EQ?
