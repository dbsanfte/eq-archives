My<br/>\nquestion is this.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Are the trade skills really good and do they play a<br/>\npart of succeeding at higher levels?&quot;<br/>\nHere is why I ask.  My friend is a level 17 druid and<br/>\na tailor.  He can&#39;t make armor that my level 13 Ranger<br/>\ncan use that is worthwhile to me.  I bought some mail<br/>\nboots and chest armor, which are far better than what<br/>\nhe can make.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also doing pottery with my Druid and I can&#39;t see<br/>\nany value to this trade.  If I make 30 muffin tins, is<br/>\nsome baker really going to buy the lot off me?<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that as I get up in level, I will be able to<br/>\nget better Drop items than I can make.<br/>\nHowever, I do know that trades take part in some<br/>\nquests and this is the only purpose I can see for<br/>\nthem.  I think<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing something here?<br/>\n<br/>\nTrade confused!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo!
