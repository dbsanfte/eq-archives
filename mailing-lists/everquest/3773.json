I rock! Last night I was playing my Gnome Warrior Genmay, I had just<br/>\nhit lvl13, got my dual weild skill, and was hunting Minos in Ak&#39;Anon. Well I<br/>\ngo in and pull what I think is just one out of the cave but in all reality<br/>\nis actually four slavers! I change to one of the wide views and realize my<br/>\ndelima. Figuring that I would probably die before I got to the guard and<br/>\neven then he wouldn&#39;t be much help I decide to pull up my boots and lay into<br/>\nthem and at least try to do as much damage as possible. I changed from my<br/>\ntwo Mino battle axes to my Graoning Mace to give me a little better chance<br/>\nof taking at least one, maybe two slavers out before I die. So far i&#39;m doing<br/>\npretty good! I&#39;ve killed one and really wailing on another when I get<br/>\nattacked by a stupid giant infected rat! &quot;Oh great!&quot; I thought figuring my<br/>\nfate was sealed. I ignore the rat and keep wailing on the Minos. Luckily<br/>\nsomone was nice enough to come by and kill the rat for me. By this time I<br/>\nwas down to one bub!<br/>\n&gt; ble of life left and still two Minos to go. I finish off the one I&#39;ve been<br/>\nworking on and go right after the last one. &quot;I&#39;m dead so I might as well die<br/>\nwith my boots on!&quot; I thought, Well suddenly the mino takes off and starts<br/>\nrunning away! &quot;Holy cow! I might make this!&quot; I take off after him and<br/>\nfinally kill him.<br/>\n&gt; So now I&#39;m standing there with a smidgen of a bubble left for life, 4 dead<br/>\nmino slavers and a giant diseased rat at my feet. &quot;I have just taken out 4<br/>\nmino slavers!  RRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&quot; I yell. That felt so good!<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\">http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
