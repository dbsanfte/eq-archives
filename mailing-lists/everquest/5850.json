They&#39;re bought for 2 cp each in the PoK<br/>\n&gt; Library. Full melee classes<br/>\n&gt; get them around 30th level, while hybrids have to<br/>\n&gt; wait until 51st (my main,<br/>\n&gt; a ranger, is just about nearing the point where I<br/>\n&gt; can get his first<br/>\n&gt; Discipline -- the Resistant Discipline, I believe,<br/>\n&gt; which is the one warriors<br/>\n&gt; get at 30th or 31st).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Disciplines have been in the game for some time now.<br/>\n&gt; Someone who has been in<br/>\n&gt; the game for a few years could probably shed more<br/>\n&gt; light on exactly how old<br/>\n&gt; they are. I&#39;ve only played since January 2003, and I<br/>\n&gt; think they might&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been around at that time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once you have the Discipline book, you open it and<br/>\n&gt; learn the Discipline.<br/>\n&gt; Each Discipline has certain benefits (Resistant<br/>\n&gt; bumps up all your<br/>\n&gt; resistances, for instances). They last for a certain<br/>\n&gt; amount of time, but you<br/>\n&gt; can only use them once every X number of hours of<br/>\n&gt; play. There&#39;s a window<br/>\n&gt; that you can pull up (can&#39;t remember the command to<br/>\n&gt; open it up) that lets<br/>\n&gt; you activate the Disciplines.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Su [mailto:suceress@...]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know they are for melee classes. I think you have<br/>\n&gt; to buy books from a<br/>\n&gt; merchant of your class to get disciplines. I think<br/>\n&gt; there might be AA ones as<br/>\n&gt; well. I don&#39;t play melee class so I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe a monk, rogue, or<br/>\n&gt; warrior could shed some more light.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry I can&#39;t be of more help.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system<br/>\n&gt; (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt; Version: 6.0.775 / Virus Database: 522 - Release<br/>\n&gt; Date: 08/10/2004<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
