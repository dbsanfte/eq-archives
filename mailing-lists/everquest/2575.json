Often the velium weapons can be had for less.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that you will be able to hunt for magic weapon drops at <br/>\nyour level. You most probably will have to buy the weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep you eyes open, though. I got a velium morning star outside the <br/>\nbank in Rivervale. Someone had just left it laying on the ground. You <br/>\nnever know what you might find.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nHalfling Druid lvl 31<br/>\nZeb server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Biltilie Dwimmerlaik &lt;biltilie@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Kaos wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have only been playing a month and I am wondering where do you <br/>\nfind magic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapons in this game...My two main characters are a 11th level <br/>\nBarbarian<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Warrior and a 9th level Half elf Bard.....any help would be <br/>\ngreat....by the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way plz dont say buy it from other players...I dont have much in <br/>\nPP&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; actually it is cheaper to buy some weapons from other players,<br/>\n&gt; especially after the game is somewhat &quot;old&quot;, in other words<br/>\n&gt; there are so many high level people out there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; but you don&#39;t have to look at the things offered in EC, because<br/>\n&gt; almost everything there sold is &quot;stylish&quot; or &quot;ueber&quot;. so IMHO the<br/>\n&gt; prices there are so high because people are willing to pay high<br/>\n&gt; prices to get one of those kinky new weapons.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; when i was young i tried to get some magic pieces as well. (i<br/>\n&gt; started with warrior chars as well - IMHO a good thing to do, to<br/>\n&gt; learn the game mechanics) and i always wanted to hunt those nasty<br/>\n&gt; skellies in tundra, but they could only be hit by magic weapons.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; my dream weapon as this time were barbed whips and langseax swords.<br/>\n&gt; because i couldn&#39;t afford them, i got tentacle whips from someone<br/>\n&gt; for 20pp each. now those weapons are almost always destroyed when<br/>\n&gt; looted because they don&#39;t even give good money at the merchants.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and the kunark, velious and luclin expansion gave so many new <br/>\nweapons<br/>\n&gt; that the old ones almost got unknown (better say ignored), on the <br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; hand you can get magic weapons cheaper now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and now compare prices with those combine weapons sold in EC at the<br/>\n&gt; shady. i think they are the only magic weapons you can buy from an<br/>\n&gt; old world merchant (actually don&#39;t know of any other merchant). and<br/>\n&gt; i think gypsie camps have merchants selling some weapons as well ...<br/>\n&gt; i am not sure if those were magic ones ... oh the old days ... ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; if you play on Tarem Warr, we could arrange a meeting: i think i <br/>\nstill<br/>\n&gt; have many things on my different chars, i don&#39;t really need.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; take care<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Biltilie Dwimmerlaik<br/>\n&gt; level 52 magician<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt; &lt;not guilded anymore&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
