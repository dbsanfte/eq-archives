Soloing just isn&#39;t practical. I have to rely on others<br/>\nalot. But others rely on my healing skills and sometimes my ability to stun<br/>\na mob. It feels good to be the one keeping the group alive.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed. If your guild &quot;needs another cleric&quot; why not? Skill can be made up<br/>\nfor more easily than you think. My halfie cleric was PLed to 10 via<br/>\nquests...CB belts, Krag chick talons and bone chips...by 12 her skills were<br/>\nas good as anyone else&#39;s. This was pre-changes and it made life a lot<br/>\neasier. Unfortunately, clerics are boring, and STAY boring.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: mlockridge01<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, April 30, 2002 12:19 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Hello I am new<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree as far as not pl on first characters. Important game skills<br/>\n  are aquired through solo and group leveling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  PL is valuable for some alternate characters. How many times must one<br/>\n  spend endless hours killing spiders? If your plan for your alt is<br/>\n  more than just experiencing EQ from a different class perspective, pl<br/>\n  can be a legitimate gaming tool.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Orion&quot; &lt;orionv@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Don&#39;t be afraid to ask someone to pl you??
