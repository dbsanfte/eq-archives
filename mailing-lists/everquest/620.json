But more like things like rubicite, mithril eq etc.. And they HAVE put level caps on some eq in a way now.. Since you can&#39;t even go into fear plane below level 46 anymore, all that eq is capped at level 46.. AND nodrop.. I just dont want everything to be nodrop so it hinders the trade economy, I want to be able to trade away my old weapon for a new one and a shitload of platina, when I can, instead of just putting the old weapon in the bank to rot away, or destroying it..<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron Elselynn - Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 11, 1999 6:21 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Survey results ???? - my 2 coppers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Avron Elselynn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avron@...\">avron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;With a vote count of 19 here are the results of the survey concerning &gt;no <br/>\n&gt; &gt;drop items..

I&#39;d hate like hell to see a level cap put on certain <br/>\n&gt; items, and here&#39;s why. I saved every single copper I could, and worked my <br/>\n&gt; smithing skills up just high enough to be able to make a few banded items <br/>\n&gt; with a decent success rate. After saving for weeks, lagging behind in <br/>\n&gt; levels, spending countless hours at the forge, and seeing a lot of good <br/>\n&gt; friends lose interest in EQ, I managed to save up enough to get a steel <br/>\n&gt; chestplate. If they impose a level cap on items, then I just may well lose <br/>\n&gt; the ability to wear what took about 2.5 to 3 weeks to save for, and that was <br/>\n&gt; after the month of saving enough cash to work up my smithing skill in the <br/>\n&gt; first place. I don&#39;t think that it would be fair to lose the ability to <br/>\n&gt; wear/wield it after all that. However, on the same note, I don&#39;t think that <br/>\n&gt; 1st level characters should be wearing mithril and steel either. So where is <br/>\n&gt; the line drawn, where it&#39;s fair for those of us who don&#39;t/didn&#39;t twink, but <br/>\n&gt; manage through legitimate means to get something of great worth and those <br/>\n&gt; who twink? It&#39;s a fine line. And by the way - I&#39;m 14th level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; Drawing is held each week through August 20.
