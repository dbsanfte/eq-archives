Usually im in a group, and as <br/>\nhappens when fighiting in Oasis, usually one or more of my party <br/>\nmembers gets rabies or is poisoned by whatever mob we are fighting at <br/>\nthe time.  Since as a shaman i have Cure Disease (which cures rabies) <br/>\nand Cure Poison, i keep them memmed so that if a party member is <br/>\npoisoned or becomes rabid, i can cure them (most of the time, it <br/>\nworks on the first cast, the second one if nothing else).  The other <br/>\nday, i was grouped with two gnomes, one a warrior and the other... i <br/>\ncant remember, but he was a gnome too, and another barbarian.  We <br/>\nwere fighting a madman or zombie or something like that, and everyone <br/>\nbut me got rabies.  I healed the barbarian of it no sweat, but i used <br/>\nup my entire mana bar trying to heal the gnomes!  For some reason, it <br/>\nwouldnt work, no matter how many times i cast it!  So i went to the <br/>\ndock and there were some other random people that were rabid too, and <br/>\ni healed them without a problem, but i still couldnt heal the <br/>\ngnomes!! Should i report this as a bug or is this just something that <br/>\nis the norm?  Help on this matter would be appreciated!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you sooooo much,<br/>\nLorecie &lt;Vivix Protectorate&gt;<br/>\n16th shaman<br/>\nErrolisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
