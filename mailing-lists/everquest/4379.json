I think they should be like portable banks.<br/>\n&gt; Except they wouldn&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; coin conversion.<br/>\n&gt; I also kinda wish the horses and stuff could be like<br/>\n&gt; the ones in D&D where<br/>\n&gt; there are different kinds. Ones to carry stuff, ones<br/>\n&gt; for riding, or ones for<br/>\n&gt; fighting. And riding could be a skill.<br/>\n&gt; I really wish they&#39;d lower horse prices... I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want one for prestige. I<br/>\n&gt; want one that is useful. For the prices horses cost<br/>\n&gt; they should give you<br/>\n&gt; +100 to your charisma.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hey, that&#39;s pretty cool! Give a little, get a<br/>\n&gt; little, I guess, LOL. Oh,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I agree... horses and dinosaurs should definitely<br/>\n&gt; have bags equiped with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them, or at least there should be the option to<br/>\n&gt; buy some that fit on<br/>\n&gt; them...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and they should reduce weight 100%, seeing as you<br/>\n&gt; are not the one carrying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them, LOL.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -= Mippon - Level 40 Druid Halfling =-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
