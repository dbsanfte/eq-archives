Sure a Real good one but for the<br/>\naverage Joe, I can&#39;t see why you cant get a nice<br/>\ncomputer nowadays for around 700-900.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an Intel Celeron 1.2 Ghz with 300+ megs of ram<br/>\nand a Nvidia 64 mb video card. I get no lag most of<br/>\nthe time unless extreme casting in populated places.<br/>\n<br/>\nMachine runs smooth and fast enough for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree on the lag in zones though, until I bought<br/>\nmy newer computer, I could not stand to fight on Laggy<br/>\nzones. TOo much hassle.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck on the gamecube although I think I would go<br/>\nPS2 since you can get your fix of EQ online<br/>\nadventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;mlockridge01 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt;&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our most current game platform is the N64, but that<br/>\n&gt; is my son&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; exclusive property and resides in his room.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The computer is shared, and getting another one, and<br/>\n&gt; another line (or <br/>\n&gt; DSL on a network) is a bit costly for the family<br/>\n&gt; right now. So, a <br/>\n&gt; game platform for the TV is just the ticket for when<br/>\n&gt; someone else is <br/>\n&gt; playing EQ, or satisfying their email and surfing<br/>\n&gt; habit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why Gamecube? Metroid Prime. Love the Metroid<br/>\n&gt; franchise. Don&#39;t mind <br/>\n&gt; some of the cute (Mario, StarFox) games, either.<br/>\n&gt; Some are quite <br/>\n&gt; playable, and often very good as far as gaming.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just wonder how much more money I can scrape<br/>\n&gt; together for endless <br/>\n&gt; computer upgrades. Bottom line comes to at least<br/>\n&gt; $1700 to get current <br/>\n&gt; with the specs for EQ, and a little bit ahead as<br/>\n&gt; well. I just don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; know where I can get that money right now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, a cheaper alternative is the platform system.<br/>\n&gt; All things <br/>\n&gt; considered, upgrades for that every few years will<br/>\n&gt; still be cheaper <br/>\n&gt; than the big bucks I need for the computer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But the games, while good, are not the same.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The up side is that there is much in the EQ world I<br/>\n&gt; can continue to <br/>\n&gt; explore and enjoy even without the upgrades. I find<br/>\n&gt; the lag in Luclin <br/>\n&gt; and POP to be a bit anoying, but acceptable for all<br/>\n&gt; but heavy combat. <br/>\n&gt; My son will do battle even with the lag, but I avoid<br/>\n&gt; it. I find the <br/>\n&gt; lag to be too distracting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can quest there, use the bazaar, and transport<br/>\n&gt; system for my non-<br/>\n&gt; druid alts. Plus, I have only just begun in Velious.<br/>\n&gt; Still lots to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; May just get lucky with a lottery ticket one day.<br/>\n&gt; Then a nice botique <br/>\n&gt; machine would be mine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In case I don&#39;t get back on before the big day,<br/>\n&gt; Merry Christmas and <br/>\n&gt; Happy Holidays to all. I really appreciate the EQ<br/>\n&gt; community, and this <br/>\n&gt; group in particular. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
