It will <br/>\n&gt;bore you to death not to mention give your &gt;fingers cramps.. ;) I estimate <br/>\n&gt;if you do it well you can have full &gt;set of steel plate and a wb sword in <br/>\n&gt;about 75 realtime hours of &gt;pottery.. If you really want to &quot;cheat&quot; like <br/>\n&gt;this, and spend the time &gt;required to do it, I feel VERY sorry for you.. ;) <br/>\n&gt;But then again &gt;there are those that play over 10h per day(I feel sorry for <br/>\n&gt;them &gt;already;), they can be wearing this set of nice items in about a week <br/>\n&gt; &gt;and a half..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Avron Elselynn -<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I myself have used pottery to help work up my smithing skills, after having <br/>\nsunk over 300p into it without using ANY trade skills at all. So I can <br/>\nunderstand how easy it is to use, and the temptation to abuse it. What I&#39;ve <br/>\nfound is happening now, is that players are forming super &quot;twink&quot; guilds; <br/>\nthey all learn pottery, and then work up their cash. Now as you said, for an <br/>\nexample 75 hours of pottery, is now cut to 7.5 hours. Now just imagine a <br/>\nlarger guild which is pretty common - say 20 to 30 members. You just cut it <br/>\ndown to 2.5 to 3.5 hours each. In no time whatsoever, you&#39;ll have a massive <br/>\narmy of &quot;twinks&quot; that could quite possibly mow down most things (within <br/>\nreason mind you - I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be taking on giants and dragons!) if <br/>\nthey group rush and gaining levels quickly. With this in mind, I&#39;d be <br/>\nperfectly happy just to break even, rather than make a profit off of a trade <br/>\nskill. After all, Verant put them there for us to use wheter it was <br/>\nforethought or afterthought. But truthfully, who wants to use a trade skill <br/>\nwhich at the moment, has little to no real value/use and that costs you both <br/>\ntime and money ingame? Very few will endeavor to take on such a task.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
