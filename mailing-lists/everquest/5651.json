But I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; able to do any real playing, just wandered around on<br/>\n&gt; an alt for a few minutes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After reading all this though, I&#39;m not sure if I want<br/>\n&gt; to try and play, hehe. Maybe I&#39;ll wait a few more<br/>\n&gt; weeks... or months...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nYea the new graphics are great, the skys fabulous, but the probs continue.<br/>\nJust today i fell through the earth but they added a new feature thats<br/>\nsupposed to detect that and drop you at a safe point in the zone.  Dont know<br/>\nwhat else they are adding as a &quot;safety net&quot; type moves, but at least they<br/>\nare working on keeping us alive and moving till they get them fixed. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
