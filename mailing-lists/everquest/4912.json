Or lose a percentage of cash on hand if you aren&#39;t rezzed... something to make rezzing still worthwhile but less of a hassle if you can&#39;t get it done.<br>\n<br>\nI like the NPC idea too... that would be great b/c then you wouldn&#39;t have to go back somewhere dangerous (and without all the gear to help protect you!) to get your body back. <br>\n<br>\nI have to say though... I am grateful that you don&#39;t lose all your spells too when you die... it would suck to have to buy all of them back again!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&quot;Sail to your heart&#39;s desires, and know when to drop anchor.&quot;</span></blockquote></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
