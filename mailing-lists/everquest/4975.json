But I&#39;ve been in Dulak a lot lately <br/>\nand each ship is a camp.  Passing through the old camp areas I have <br/>\nheard camp checks, but not as often as in the old days.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to remember is that there are no exclusive rights to a <br/>\ncamp.  The EQ play nice rules say that any spot in dispute must be <br/>\nshared.  Sure, usually a GM has to enforce it and who&#39;s seen a GM <br/>\nlately?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I wouldn&#39;t worry about reprisals from campers.  What can they <br/>\ndo?  Actions speak louder than words.  You wouldn&#39;t want to group <br/>\nwith people that don&#39;t pay attention to their area.  That can get you <br/>\nkilled in plenty of zones.  And there&#39;s always /report and /ignore if <br/>\nthey bother you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\nRanger of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
