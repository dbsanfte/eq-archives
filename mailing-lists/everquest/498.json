You want to be evil <br/>\nor good? IMO if you would be evil (but I don&#39;t recomend it, unless your used <br/>\nto playing evil races) I would suggest a troll. I don&#39;t know if you would <br/>\nreally care but they have faster HP regeneration. I have not played a troll <br/>\nbut I think the ogres home city is not so great. They&#39;res not much stuff to <br/>\nfight and it would take longer to level. If youre good, then be a barbarian. <br/>\nThey have one of the BEST home cities I have ever been to. I was able to get <br/>\nto level 11 in two days. And they have great things for even higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Blizzard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blizzard15@...\">blizzard15@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Shaman@onelist.com\">EQ_Shaman@onelist.com</a>&gt;, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EverQuest] Race<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 28 Jun 1999 17:12:53 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am planning on making a shaman and I was wondering which you all think is <br/>\n&gt;the best.
