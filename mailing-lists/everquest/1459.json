Sense Traps, Disarm Traps..  they both work the same.<br/>\nSimply click on the button and an attempt will be made.. be there a trap or<br/>\nnot the skill will improve.  It&#39;s lame true, however, verant never bother to<br/>\nchange it.  BTW if your in sola or b..  you disarm a trap by clicking the<br/>\nmouse on the trap itself.. the button &quot;disarm traps&quot; wont disarm it.. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nD<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nygaardr, FC3 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nygaardr@...\">nygaardr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 23, 2001 3:50 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EverQuest] Hi, I am new & stupid :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can practice on some traps in Sol A and Sol B.<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Knight [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:knight@...\">knight@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 22, 2001 3:40 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Hi, I am new & stupid :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a brand spankin&#39; new rogue and I have some questions.  I would<br/>\n&gt; greatly appreciate any feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Woohoo!! Congrats, rogues are a fun class to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1)  How does &quot;sneak&quot; work exactly?  Can I sneak across someone&#39;s line of<br/>\n&gt; sight?  What is the difference between &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; that comes<br/>\n </span></blockquote>later?<br/>\n<br/>\nSneak, when successful, makes you walk &quot;quietly&quot; (slowly) by/near mobs<br/>\nwithout <br/>\nbeing seen.  However, usually if you are in the mobs line of sight it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork that often.  It&#39;s great for sneaking behind mobs to get past them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHide, by itself, makes you invisible but you can&#39;t move.  If you Hide AND<br/>\nSneak<br/>\n(forget which order you need to do it in; i have it hot keyed :) ), you can <br/>\nbascially walk around invis. :)  Be sure to keep both skills MAXED.  It&#39;s a<br/>\nreal life and corpse saver.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI have fun hide/sneaking up to mobs and attempting to pickpocket them. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.  Does it do me any good to<br/>\n&gt; attack monsters from behind without the ability yet?  I have been making<br/>\n </span></blockquote>an<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; effort to do just that, but should I not even bother?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Contrary to belief, hitting a mob from behind does give extra bonus.  About<br/>\n2 years ago Verant posted there is an extra (if slight) benefit from<br/>\nattacking<br/>\nbehind; lower AC?  While fighting mutiple mobs, people have noticed that<br/>\nthey<br/>\nget hit harder from behind than in front.  Stick a green mob behind you, and<br/>\nnote<br/>\nthe average damage.  Then turn around; the average damage is less.  This is<br/>\nwhy most<br/>\nppl try to get the mobs all in front of them instead of having some behind<br/>\nthem. <br/>\nThough the mob templates differ from characters, the principle is the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow when you get the backstab ability, you&#39;ll really wreak havoc!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot recall<br/>\n&gt; having ever seen or heard of a trap in EQ.  Can anyone give an example of<br/>\n&gt; where and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>\n&gt; there is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Disarm Traps skill was basically a non usuable skill, until the Velious<br/>\nexpansion launched.   The Disarm Traps skill will come in very handy in the<br/>\nland of Velious.  Hmmm.. then again, our group usually sets them off so we<br/>\ncan have something to kill (assuming mobs spawn when triggered).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the old world (non expansion lands), I don&#39;t know of any traps to<br/>\npractice skills on.  I know of a locked door in freeport, by the docks, that<br/>\nyou can probably practice lock picking, but that&#39;s about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bah, better to ask questions than be a useless rogue; and believe me, i&#39;ve<br/>\nran into some doozies. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep those piercing skills up! And if you can afford it, grab a bow and<br/>\nfletching<br/>\nkit and make some arrows.  It makes pulling mobs eaiser.  The one thing I<br/>\nfound<br/>\nreally annoying was sneaking into position to fight a mob only to have it<br/>\ncasted<br/>\non by some caster a mile away.   Now I just &quot;appear&quot; out of no where, fling<br/>\nthe bow,<br/>\nkill the mob, and disappear again. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n -Knight<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
