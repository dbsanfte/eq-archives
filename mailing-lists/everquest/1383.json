When I first started playing I was actually scared. A thunderstorm had<br/>\nstarted and I was sitting there wide-eyed asking my sister (over the phone)<br/>\nif lightning could hurt people. When I tried to follow her everything seemd<br/>\nso big.. I had never played this type of game before. It was amazing...<br/>\nI still get my pulse up when running from a train. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I am rather new to the game, but one of the things that fascinates me<br/>\n&gt; is the real sense of danger when I put my character in a new<br/>\n&gt; situation. Heart pounds, pulse rate goes up, I even get the shakes<br/>\n&gt; sometimes. I seldom get that in real life, even though I have a job<br/>\n&gt; that requires occasional physical combat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I love this game!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto of Rivervale.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., LeSamLam@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As far as I know, there&#39;s only the port to the Dreadlands.
