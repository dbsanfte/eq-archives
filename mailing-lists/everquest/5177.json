Also there is not a lot of <br/>\nroom to kite there, so it is mainly rangers you ever see there.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor druids at 46 I am sorry to say that other than GD, EW, <br/>\nand &quot;maybe&quot; PoD, your kiting days for solo are just about over.  <br/>\nTime to get a group and have some fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrago<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think Jaggedpine is actually attached to surefall glade. so if <br/>\nyou are kos<br/>\n&gt; in surefall you need to be careful.
