I played <br/>\nDAOC for a little, but its boring and I want to get back to EQ.  The <br/>\nproblem is, my friend is still using the account and my cd-key.  Is <br/>\nthere any former players that don&#39;t need their cd-keys and they could <br/>\npossible e-mail it to me? i would greatly appreciate it.  If <br/>\nnot....i&#39;ll have to buy the game...again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
