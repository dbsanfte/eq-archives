However I believe it more likely comes from<br/>\nthe fact that some defensive skills don&#39;t work when something&#39;s attacking<br/>\nyou from behind.  Most mobs are based off the warrior class so inherent the<br/>\nsame defense skills i.e. Riposte, etc. Truth be told as a ranger I prefer to<br/>\navoid the brunt of the attack and position myself behind the target while<br/>\ngrouped.
