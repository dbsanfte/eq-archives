It&#39;d be nice if all the trades<br/>\nwere PC desirable as far as produced product is<br/>\nconcerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, however, you refer to people being able to profit<br/>\nfrom the NPCs, I must resoundingly disagree. <br/>\nEverquest is different from UO in that macros and such<br/>\naren&#39;t usable in EQ; but the potential for abuse still<br/>\nexists.  To be able to take an evening (3-6 hours) to<br/>\ncrank out ten or twenty plat an hour of profit off the<br/>\nNPCs has far too much potential for abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrices in the game, both vendor and player, are<br/>\ngenerally set to encourage certain &#39;level ranges&#39; of<br/>\nbuyers; a first level character shouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>\nafford to buy a Polished Granite Tomahawk, or a pair<br/>\nof Dusty Bloodstained Gloves.<br/>\n<br/>\nNPC profit is abuseable because you can, literally,<br/>\nstand there and crank out a vast quantity of product<br/>\nto sell to the poor vendor; in real life the guy would<br/>\neventually tell you he really did have all the pie<br/>\ntins (or whatever) that he needed for now (and the<br/>\nnext three years).  NPCs in a computer game will keep<br/>\ntaking.  If they implemented a &#39;volume based reaction&#39;<br/>\nto the vendor prices, people would scream bloody<br/>\nmurder.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If that were the case, you&#39;d have only a small<br/>\n&gt; amount of people really taking advantage of it,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, reference the insanse amount of screaming done<br/>\nover the recent Verant fix to Brewing (removing the<br/>\ntwinkable profit level from it).  Small, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My argument is really about making money.<br/>\n&gt; Adventuring is what this game is all about, but<br/>\n&gt; killing things shouldn&#39;t be the only way. It&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; great for my situation, because of the limited hours<br/>\n&gt; I can play it&#39;s hard to form a group and go<br/>\n&gt; adventuring, so I have to solo a lot. But right now<br/>\n&gt; I have 4 characters at 5th level, and it&#39;s hard<br/>\n&gt; getting to the next step without a group. If I could<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You will typically solo until you hit double digits<br/>\n(10+), and even after that will still only group some<br/>\nof the time.  Most people hanging out in the &#39;outdoor<br/>\nareas&#39; (Commonlands, GFaydark, Butcherblock, Ro<br/>\nDesert) won&#39;t group up (for whatever reason).  When<br/>\nyou get to the midteens and start visiting dungeons<br/>\n(Befallen, Runnyeye, etc...), you&#39;ll be able to group<br/>\nconsistently and constantly.  DO NOT judge the game,<br/>\nthe economy, or the grouping situation; do not judge<br/>\n*anything* about Everquest based on what you see at<br/>\nany level below at least 15, and probably 20.  The<br/>\ngame is different for newbies and youngsters than it<br/>\nis after you put some levels on your character.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncluding the money.  At 15th, visiting dungeons, I<br/>\nbegan to make *good* money with my character; it all<br/>\nchanges at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; spend a few days making some money to better equip<br/>\n&gt; myself, it would be a lot easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is the abuseable part I describe above.  5th<br/>\nlevel characters shouldn&#39;t be able to afford to outfit<br/>\nthemselves with full banded or a combine weapon or whatever.<br/>\n===<br/>\n:D<br/>\n       Dave&#39;s World<br/>\n-No matter where you go, there you are-<br/>\n&quot;People will believe a lie either because they want to<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s true, or because they fear it is.&quot; Wizard&#39;s<br/>\nFirst Rule, Sword of Truth, Terry Goodkind</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
