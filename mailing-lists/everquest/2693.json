Just about any Gnoll you see on the north end with a staff <br/>\nhas one.  It&#39;s a 9/47 magic weapon.  They&#39;re lore so people just <br/>\nleave them after a while.  Any caster below 30 has one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n35th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\nPS you can see by the name where me tastes lie!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
