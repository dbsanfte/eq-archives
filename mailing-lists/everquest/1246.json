Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br/>\nhealer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br/>\ntotally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>\nloot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they care<br/>\nabout is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>\n&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>\nchance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>\nstill loot out of turn.<br/>\nAnd then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>\nWhen I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>\nninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>\npicked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an expensive<br/>\nitem). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>\nbronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>\nfor bronze armor&quot;...<br/>\nHas anyone else had this problem?<br/>\nWhat do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>\nJust wondering.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\nps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>\npeople cooperate.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
