Go kill gnolls in<br/>\n&gt; Blackburrow...it raises those factions without hurting your other ones.<br/>\n&gt; Also, tho I&#39;m not sure how city guards would react to you, the Gnome<br/>\nShadow<br/>\n&gt; Knights are followers of Bertoxx as well and might welcome you as a<br/>\nkindred<br/>\n&gt; soul.
