I got started playin EQ a few months ago,<br/>\n&gt; on a friend&#39;s account, and got my bard to lvl 34 before he pretty<br/>\n&gt; much wouldn&#39;t let me play anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now I&#39;ve got my own account, and my main is a lvl 31 cleric. Getting<br/>\n&gt; there was pretty easy, I just did everything I&#39;d already done<br/>\n&gt; before. One of my RL friends helps me whenever he&#39;s on, but we can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; always be on at the same time, and he&#39;s usually busy off on some<br/>\n&gt; raid with his guild. Plus I&#39;m getting tired of bugging him all the<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So where do I go from here? Where are the best places for xp? Are<br/>\n&gt; there any quests or anything that I should be doing, and what? I<br/>\n&gt; would very much appreciate any suggestions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Laielenie<br/>\n&gt; lvl 31 cleric<br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
