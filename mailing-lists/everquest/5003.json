So, I wearied of mugging Frost<br/>\nGiants in various locations, and went looking for something<br/>\ninteresting to do solo. I first returned to some favorite haunts where<br/>\nI knew Hill Giants were and took a few of those. A bit more profitable<br/>\nthan Frost Giants, but not so interesting that I spent much time<br/>\nhunting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I decided to try CC. Went to the Rygor fortress, and found the<br/>\nlittle building at the back. Could see the &quot;snowball&quot; inside, but an<br/>\niron bar gate was blocking the doorway. I had never heard of this<br/>\nbeing there. Anyone know what is up? Was I just not fully informed, or<br/>\nis this gate something new?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
