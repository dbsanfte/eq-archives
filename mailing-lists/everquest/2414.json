I played<br/>\n&gt; DAOC for a little, but its boring and I want to get back to EQ.  The<br/>\n&gt; problem is, my friend is still using the account and my cd-key.  Is<br/>\n&gt; there any former players that don&#39;t need their cd-keys and they could<br/>\n&gt; possible e-mail it to me? i would greatly appreciate it.  If<br/>\n&gt; not....i&#39;ll have to buy the game...again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
