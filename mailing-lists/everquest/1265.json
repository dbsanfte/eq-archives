Glad to see this NG start to pick up again too. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI play a Human cleric and basically broke as well.  Almost every group i&#39;ve gotten into<br/>\nloot up before the cleric does.  I played in one group for 4 hours and only looted <br/>\nonce.  During a random roll for a nice item (armor piece), the tanks got first roll on <br/>\nit.  I&#39;m lvl 44 and still wearing some Bronze and Banded pieces.      <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing the cleric since the day EQ opened its servers to the public, and<br/>\njoined Tunare (Hi Mu! :) ) the minute it went live.   I&#39;m not a power player, and in<br/>\nall this time i&#39;ve only made it to lvl 44.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I did take a few months break inbetween.  What I noticed though is that as<br/>\nthe server ages, or maybe its the more ppl on the servers, or the level range of players<br/>\ni&#39;m grouping with now, but groups have gotten very greedy.  The first 20-30 levels way back<br/>\nwhen the server was still new, people were nice, loot was evenly distributed, and all was <br/>\ngood.  I take a few months break and come back and its gone down the toilet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days I have to summon food and water just to save money.  I can&#39;t afford all my<br/>\nlvl 44 spells yet either, which is a shame.  This is not to say that there aren&#39;t &quot;good&quot;<br/>\ngroups/people out there, but they&#39;re just very hard to find these days.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCiao,<br/>\n-Knight; hopping one day to make it to lvl 50 and have All his spells. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
