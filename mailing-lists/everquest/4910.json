The only good thing I thought of for corpse runs was<br/>\nthat you<br/>\n&gt; can be summoned back to your corpse so you don&#39;t have to make the<br/>\ntrek to<br/>\n&gt; wherever you died all over again. But yeah, if you can&#39;t find your<br/>\ncorpse<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s a royal pain.<br/>\n&gt; Would you have it so you have all your gear but can still be rezzed? or<br/>\n&gt; would you just eliminate rezzes?<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or, if you could go back in time and change something about<br/>\nEverquest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s creation to have certain features, what would you have done<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; differently?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Definitely I would get rid of the corpse-hunting. I understand<br/>\nlosing exp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when you die, I think that&#39;s a good thing (well not GOOD but it makes<br/>\n&gt; sense) but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going back to find your body to get all your stuff back just sucks.<br/>\n&gt; Especially<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when you die somewhere you can&#39;t get back to. WHY can&#39;t you ever<br/>\nfind a<br/>\n&gt; necro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when you need one?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sail to your heart&#39;s desires, and know when to drop anchor.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
