There you can find a number<br/>\nof smithing supplies. However the journey is lonnnngggg and dangerous to under<br/>\n9th level characters. Camo and Invis a great help. Take Qeynos Hills to west<br/>\nkarana to north karana to east karana and then to HighHold Pass and explore the<br/>\ncity. You could also go into the beholder maze if you and a 17+ character and<br/>\nfight some mudites, they drop ore and clay.<br/>\n<br/>\nMCollins wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: MCollins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sandman1@...\">sandman1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am a beginning smith based in Qeynos and i am having a great deal of<br/>\n&gt; trouble finding ore near that city.  I was told that the closest place<br/>\n&gt; to find ore was in the Dwarven area, but I find it hard to believe that<br/>\n&gt; I would have to go that far!  Does anyone know of a place I can get ore<br/>\n&gt; within 2or 3 zones of Qeynos?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Marc<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the Week!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
