I obviously enjoy<br>playing. :-) I&#39;m not sure exactly what \n  kind of advice you&#39;re asking for<br>here. Anything specific you need to know \n  about?<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>Hi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. \n  I am not a very good EQ<br>player. I would consider myself ultra competent in \n  group battles, but in<br>other aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I \n  have never gotten a<br>character past level 40. My first character was an \n  Erudite Enchanter by the<br>name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to \n  level 40 after two years or<br>so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which \n  was my friends character but I<br>own it. I just started playing again after \n  giving up on the game and playing<br>DAOC. Eventually I gave up all MMORPGS \n  deciding they were a waste of time.<br>About a week ago, I decided to give EQ \n  another chance and have decided that<br>it has improved a great deal. I am now \n  playing a Human Ranger who is level<br>30. I really like the character. His \n  buffs and damage spells are great. I<br>guess I could use some help on how to \n  be a good EQ player. I have been<br>playing for about two years and I feel \n  like I know absolutely nothing about<br>the game. I have never belonged to a \n  good guild or anything. I play on the<br>Xegony server.<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
