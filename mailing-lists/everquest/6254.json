But i didn&#39;t buy<br/>\n&gt; equip to focus on HP (as an Enchanter) but i can&#39;t find where to buy<br/>\n&gt; the spells over lvl 50.... I thought it would be in Firiona Vie but<br/>\n&gt; there were no NPCs there =P. I think someone said it is over in the<br/>\n&gt; corner to the east side but i died trying to get there because the<br/>\n&gt; spider human things... lol they see invis at random then one attacked<br/>\n&gt; and they all cames. But luckily due to being a 6 years vete i used the<br/>\n&gt; Expedient Recovery vete AA. so i lived. But i would love to chat in<br/>\n&gt; the chat room over the subject, i will be on Tuesday 28th of june<br/>\n&gt; (today) in the chat room at 5:00 Mountain Time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
