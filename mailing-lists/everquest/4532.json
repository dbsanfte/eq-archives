I <br>have tweaked the datarate to 7.0 and switched on the caching to see \n  <br>if that makes much difference.<br><br>We have the basic New Dawn with the \n  Planes of Power expansion. The <br>Options screen however states &quot;Luclin \n  Options&quot; - I don&#39;t know why.<br><br>As for the PC - maximum RAM capacity is \n  384MB and that is what is <br>installed.&nbsp; There is 50Gb free on the hard \n  disk. I have noticed that <br>while loading and zoning however, the hard disk \n  light is always on <br>meaning it is doing alot of work. I suppose this would \n  be the case as <br>it is loading alot from the hard disk.<br><br>Performance \n  within a zone seems fine on the whole,it is just initial <br>loading and in \n  particular the zoning times. Very often, after waiting <br>5 minutes, it \n  simply gives up and goes back to the server screen - <br>very \n  frustrating!<br><br>The only other components that could be awapped are the \n  hard disk <br>controller - but I really don&#39;t see that making much difference \n  since <br>it is working fine, and the video controller - which is a nVidia \n  Riva <br>TNT with just 16Mb RAM. We are running DirectX 9.<br><br>Thanks very \n  much again for all of your suggestions, and I would be <br>grateful for \n  anytthing else you can suggest.<br><br>Best regards.<br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
