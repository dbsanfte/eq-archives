Yeah EC definitely!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m female and I play female characters.  The only way I&#39;d consider playing<br/>\na male character is if their stats were better.  But, since EQ is an equal<br/>\nopportunity creator, meaning men and women share the same stats, it&#39;s not an<br/>\nissue.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I do notice that when I&#39;m playing with my 22 year old son and his male<br/>\ncharacter I get a few more buffs than him but not often.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe men play female characters because they think it will help them<br/>\nunderstand women better.  LOL  just joking!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I love the game and I don&#39;t care whether your male or female just as<br/>\nlong as you enjoy the game!<br/>\n<br/>\nKanalyn 17 Druid<br/>\nAnalyn 9 Beastlord<br/>\nAllilee 9 Ranger<br/>\nMaralexis 9 Wizard<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nAnelalyn 7 Cleric<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
