I warn you though I found it to be very touching and <br/>\nfilled with emotion. It is a big flash movie and took me about an <br/>\nhour to load on my 56k connection, but it is worth the wait, it is <br/>\ntruly unforgettable. When you first visit the link it will ask you to <br/>\ndownload a japanese language pack, just click cancel to that, you can <br/>\nview the movie perfectly fine without it. I hope you all enjoy it as <br/>\nmuch as I did, please reply with your thoughts and feelings about the <br/>\nmovie after you watch it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.att.ne.jp/surf/mirage/memory_album.html\">http://home.att.ne.jp/surf/mirage/memory_album.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
