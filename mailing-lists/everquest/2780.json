There are points in the game where your role changes.  I <br/>\nhave been through 3 of them already.  If you don&#39;t play the lower <br/>\nlevels of your class you miss a valuable learning experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard all of the excuses, it&#39;s boring, I&#39;ve already done it, <br/>\netc.  So, they run an SK up to 30 with PL and Twinking.  They <br/>\nfigure &quot;I was a Warrior before, now I just have spells too&quot; and then <br/>\nget their party killed because they don&#39;t know how to play the SK <br/>\nproperly.  But that&#39;s everyone elses fault!  Because before their <br/>\nprotector buffed them up or twinked them out to the point that the <br/>\nmobs couldn&#39;t hurt them, so why couldn&#39;t the group?  Then it&#39;s a TPW, <br/>\ncorpse run and the SK is on the /Ignore list!<br/>\n<br/>\nI laugh when I see a blueberry run by with a Skeleton chasing them <br/>\nbecause they can&#39;t hurt it, but it can hurt them.  They beg me to <br/>\nhelp them, silly twink.  Go to your well deserved death, I&#39;ll kill <br/>\nthem mob when it finishes you.  You shouldn&#39;t pick on reds just <br/>\nbecause your daddy gave you Lambant armor to wear!<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, maybe I&#39;m bitter too! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my advice is to enjoy them game and play for every level you <br/>\nget.  If some kind soul casts a SoW or other buff on you, thank <br/>\nthem.  If someone offers you a weapon or armor, thank them.  If you <br/>\nbeg for these things they may let the Mob kill you, but if your Karma <br/>\nis right they may help.  Never expect anything, you&#39;ll never be be <br/>\ndisappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember when you see a newbie struggling that you were there <br/>\nonce.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeath to all Twinks! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n35th season Ranger of Tunare. <br/>\nTerris-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
