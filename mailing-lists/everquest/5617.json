The game accounts for things such as death and LinkDeath.&nbsp; As \n  long as the group stays at least 2 people intact&nbsp; AFTER the adventure is \n  requested you can still enter the zone.&nbsp; However, you cannot request an \n  adventure by yourself or enter a zone without having requested an \n  adventure.&nbsp; You will simply get a message staing perhaps you should try \n  finding other adventurers like yourself.&nbsp; </font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Consequently depending on your class, you are \n  right, it could be entirely possible to solo an adventure zone.&nbsp; Melee \n  types without some sort of snare or crowd control will most likely have a \n  tough time doing this, but a druid, a bard, a cleric or an enchanter might \n  theoretically be able to pull it off.&nbsp; Druids don&#39;t have any kind of mez \n  that works indoors, but they do have root and snare which helps a lot.&nbsp; \n  As long as root doesn&#39;t break they can concentrate on one while kiting \n  another.&nbsp; Bards have some pacifying songs and songs which cause direct \n  damage so weaving those could possibly solo as well.&nbsp; Clerics get Pacify \n  at a higher level and combined with root could probably do okay.&nbsp; I don&#39;t \n  know much about enchanters except that they are the ultimate crowd \n  control.&nbsp; With their ability to mezmerise mobs and even groups of mobs, \n  they are hella good to have along on an adventure, plus with mind candy like \n  C1 (level 30), C2 (level 45??), and C3 (level 60) they help a group a lot with \n  mana regeneration.&nbsp; </font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">So at a normal risk adventure, I think it could \n  be done.&nbsp; Some mobs have the ability to complete heal themselves which \n  makes it damn difficult to kill them so you&#39;d really have to watch out for \n  those.&nbsp; Otherwise, good luck on your next attempt to solo.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Raido Covenfall</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">55 ELF DRU</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Cazic Thule Server</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n    <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"adurston3@...\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adurston3@...\">adurston3@...</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Friday, March 26, 2004 10:51 \n    AM</div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Digest Number \n    975</div>\n    <div><br></div><tt>Hey all,<br><br>Oddly enough you could solo one (well go \n    into one alone). I was in a group of 5 where suddenly we lost two people \n    (before even getting to adv start) and then the other two folk decided to \n    bag the adventure. So, just for Ha-Has, I took my shaman into the adv to do \n    some foraging (some of the rarer forages sell for 50-100pp a pop on the \n    Nameless). Lack of common sense got the better of me and I tried some of the \n    mobs... the first multi-pull sent me running for the exit... \n    :)<br><br>Ciao,<br>Miracht Riversfriend,<br>51 Shaman, The \n    Nameless<br>Champions of Cabilis<br>&gt; Message: \n    3<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date: Fri, 26 Mar 2004 00:48:39 -0700 (Mountain \n    Standard Time)<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From: &quot;flaumigevylke&quot; \n    &lt;flaumigevylke@...&gt;<br>&gt; Subject: Re: \n    Adventuring<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Well first you have to make sure you have the \n    expansion Lost Dungeons of<br>&gt; Norath, once you have that then you join \n    a band of adventures of around your<br>&gt; level, maximum of 6 member with \n    a spread of no more then 7 levels between<br>&gt; the highest and lowest. \n    The group leader then goes and gets the adventure<br>&gt; for the group, \n    sorry but they won&#39;t let a solo in and you all have to have<br>&gt; the \n    expansion enabled and have your adventure stones. Just one way they \n    have<br>&gt; of making you group with people to have fun and see naked as \n    someone<br>&gt; possibly all of you will die on it at some time or another. \n    You&#39;ll have a<br>&gt; main looter who loots and then sells after the \n    adventure and splits the<br>&gt; proceeds between you all, items drop from \n    the mobs which are no drops and<br>&gt; you roll on them, there&#39;s also some \n    pretty nice things drop that you&#39;ll want<br>&gt; to roll on.<br>&gt; \n    <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Flaumigavylke<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n    Quellious<br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br><br><br><tt>Visit \n    the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br></blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
