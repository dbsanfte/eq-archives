Had a bit of <br/>\na break between sessions due to having no power for most of a week. <br/>\nQuite a storm here in the Central Coast district of California.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn talking with many NPC&#39;s I found them giving me about a paragraph <br/>\nof monologue, breaking at a point which indicates more to come. <br/>\nHowever, few have the &quot;continue&quot; command attached. Anyone know how to <br/>\nget the whole monologue from these NPC&#39;s?<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried increasing the size of my dialogue box, but had no success. <br/>\nNow I did have two boxes open, side by side, and only tried adding <br/>\nlength to the box in which the NPC&#39;s were talking. I may try a wider, <br/>\nlonger box next time. Anyone have any experience in pok with this <br/>\nproblem?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
