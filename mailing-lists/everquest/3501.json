Here let<br/>\nme tell you my story and see if you feel any better ok? <br/>\n<br/>\nBack in 1988 I met this girl going to the local Jr. college in the town<br/>\nI was living in. I was a senior in high school and we really hit it off.<br/>\nI&#39;ll call her &quot;K&quot;, K and I were always together and I soon fell madly in<br/>\nlove with her. Soon the school year came to a close, things were<br/>\nchanging a little for us, I actually cut my waist long hair so her<br/>\nparents wouldn&#39;t freak! Yea, I really liked her! <br/>\nWell after she moved back to Denver I got a phone call from her. She<br/>\nwanted to break up and see other people. Of course I was devastated,<br/>\n(I&#39;m one of those sappy sensitive types), and it was hard. I agreed<br/>\nbecause I really didn&#39;t have the experience in relationships to try and<br/>\nwork something out. Well two weeks pass and my graduation came. K shows<br/>\nup to go to my graduation, which was cool and all but the night before<br/>\nwe get into this nasty fight. We&#39;re cruising along and there is a truck<br/>\nfull of some of my female friends fom school and they are drunk off<br/>\ntheir ass! They&#39;re whopin&#39; and hollarin&#39; having a good ol&#39; time. Well K<br/>\nsuddenly jumps out of the passenger seat and practically into my lap.<br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t look at them.&quot; She says to me as she entwines her arm in mine.<br/>\n&quot;Excuse me? You broke up with me remember?&quot; I said back to her, &quot;I can<br/>\nlook at whomever I want!&quot; granted it probably wasn&#39;t the most mature way<br/>\nto put it but either way we ended up into a fight. So we came home and<br/>\nwent to bed. (I left a bunch of non-important stuff out to save time,<br/>\nbtw nothing happened.)<br/>\nThe next morning I woke up before she did. I was lying there looking at<br/>\nher and thinking this will be the last time we see each other. So I<br/>\nstroke her arm ans she wakes up. We start to kiss and one thing leads to<br/>\nanother. It was my first time mind you so I was really nervous about<br/>\nthat and to top it off, my Mother was asleep in the next room! So<br/>\nafterwards I ask the usual guy question, of &quot;How was I&quot; and her response<br/>\nwas &quot;I&#39;ve had bigger.&quot; SMAK! Oh that hurt! I was destroyed, whether or<br/>\nnot it was true, (My wife says she&#39;s full of crap!), it really hurt.<br/>\nThis began a 7 year drought for me. I completely shut myself off. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t date, never went out, got into stamp collecting. ;D Man it was<br/>\nrough! So finally to make an incredibly long story a little shorter I<br/>\nfinally got back into the dating scene. I put an ad out on<br/>\ncoloradosingles.com which was a great site because I&#39;ll never meet<br/>\nsomeone say in Pennsylvania! I don&#39;t suggest going to that site now<br/>\nbecause they are now a &quot;swinger&#39;s&quot; site, unless of course your into<br/>\nthat. :-)<br/>\nSo now you know that love can happen but it just takes time. Hey are you<br/>\ngoing to the Denver Everquest Meetup? <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.meetup.com/\">http://everquest.meetup.com/</a> I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to meet some fellow CO Eqer&#39;s. Who know, you might meet that<br/>\nsomeone! ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n Message: 5<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2002 08:07:27 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;mlockridge01&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Digest Number 543<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t work. I have known several friends who either gave up or <br/>\nwere never looking who were most pleasantly surprised. I don&#39;t know <br/>\nany who were surprised in this way who regretted the partner who came <br/>\ntheir way. More happy than those I have know who were so desperate <br/>\nfor a mate that they made unwise choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are content with your own company, then whatever way things go <br/>\nyou shall do well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
