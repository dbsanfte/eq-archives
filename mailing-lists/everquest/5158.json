I<br/>\nam a graduate student at the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute of<br/>\nTechnology in Chicago. For one of my classes, entitled Observing Users, we<br/>\nhave to study a product and its users. Our group chose Everquest because we<br/>\nthink that it is very interesting and complex. As a retired online gamer I<br/>\nknow<br/>\nhow much fun and involving the games can be. In fact, I am very tempted to<br/>\njump into Everquest, but I am worried that I may lose concentration on my<br/>\nstudies. If anyone is willing to devote a little of their time to helping us<br/>\nout we<br/>\nwould really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are poor grad students and<br/>\nwill<br/>\nnot be able to compensate anyone who helps us out, but we will very very<br/>\nthankful. Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew Haywood<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
