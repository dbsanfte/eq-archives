I appreciate you using full word spelling. For some reason<br>the abbreviations annoy the hell out of some people. I can stand it to some<br>extent but sometimes it annoys me. :-)<br>I do use some abbreviations like bc when typing, but try not to have every<br>word in a sentence abbreviated. Well, it works in groups when you have to<br>type really fast. :-)<br>Cool. I vaguely remember 9th grade. It sucked. lol.<br>I bet it&#39;s fun being on summer vacation. :-)<br>What server do you play on?<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>&gt; Ok then you all want me to type with good grammer ok I will do<br>so.......while i am typeing email&#39;s to you all at least. But my friends have<br>probably gotten used to me typeing that way so i am going to keep typeing on<br>eq. But ok see .......am I typeing ok so far?? any way, I just think it is<br>easier and faster so people dont have to wait forever to\n hear a response<br>when they want it and especially while they are excited...am I correct? I am<br>14 years old and going on 9th grade, k-6 is elementry for me and 7 and 8 are<br>middle school and 9-12 is high school..........so I have been going to<br>school around 10 or 11 years, my mom put me in school when I was 5 years<br>old. Ok is everything all cleared up and all or does some one else have a<br>problem or challenge for me?<br>&gt; c ya l8er......oops i mean see you all later-----lori<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Wulfric Rennison wrote:<br>&gt; I thought this was kind of funny actually. I don&#39;t recall ever taking<br>spelling after the elementary school levels. From Grades 9 - 12 they<br>assumed that if we made it that far then we already knew how to spell. So<br>if this person is still in that phase of his/her life where Spelling is a<br>major subject of study then I could believe &quot;whole life&quot; could equal 10<br>years!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I agree with Jerry, though, who\n stated in another email that if you do<br>that by habit, then you&#39;ll find yourself doing it when you shouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s<br>best to learn proper spelling and grammar skills first and make them a<br>habit. Then you can use your internet-ese for fun. Worst thing you could<br>do is turn in a research paper for your professor that&#39;s full of<br>abbreviations and misspellings, or perhaps be making a big presentation at<br>work and have that kind of spelling and grammar. Nobody would take you<br>seriously.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There are a few reasons why people type like that: 1. Because they don&#39;t<br>know how to type properly so they can&#39;t keep up with how fast the internet<br>chat room is moving, 2. Because they really don&#39;t know how to spell or how<br>to use proper grammar, and/or 3. They think it&#39;s cool when it&#39;s really not.<br>Which one are you?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You learned to spell for a reason. You say you&#39;re good at it. So use it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Wulfric<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -----\n Original Message -----<br>&gt; From: Su<br>&gt; To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 15, 2003 1:35 AM<br>&gt; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] hey ppl read this if intrested in equestrielle<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What was your grade in reading comprehension?
