New<br/>\nbusiness..personal BS...blah blah blah.  But generally I was working on<br/>\nFletching and exploring as many places as I could.  But consider this.<br/>\nAfter all of that time exploring  and learning about the game I became able<br/>\nto start a new character and level him to 26 in about two weeks of playing.<br/>\nNot bad me thinks.  Playing casually makes it hard to gain levels.  Spend<br/>\ntoo much time travelling and looking for groups etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying full time now though!
