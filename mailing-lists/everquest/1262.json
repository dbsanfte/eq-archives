I really don&#39;t mind free for all loot,<br/>\nprovided that everyone understands no one needs to get greedy. By the sound<br/>\nof it, you were hunting in Highkeep, a personal favorite of mine. Most<br/>\ngroups that are not ffa usually go alphabetically and you keep looting until<br/>\nyou get a total of 2pp, a bronze or FS weapon or armor, or some combination<br/>\nof ore (down in the warrior and raider rooms).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think any looting order is any better than others.
