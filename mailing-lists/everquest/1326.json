It was<br/>\nduring a GM run event.  First a bit of a disclaimer this is the first event<br/>\nthat I ever went to that was not a kill the bad guy event.  I had been to<br/>\nmany before this and when Mayong Mistmoore started running his mouth towards<br/>\na few people in the crowd (namely a lovely wood elf bard), I had just about<br/>\nhad enough of him.  So I charmed his buddy and tried to sick it on him but<br/>\nbefore I could sickhim someone dispelled him, oh well.  I really would have<br/>\nlove to have off&#39;d one of the more famous mobs in game.  But instead I was<br/>\nbanished to Tox forest where I was yelled at.  Ahh such is life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to change the color on the picture because the ship wont let me send a<br/>\nfile that is too large.</div>","specialLinks":[],"attachmentsInfo":[]}}
