My mother really got into the harvesting/crafting. She&#39;s now a master clothier and makes a ton of money selling stuff in the bazaar. She sells about 20 items every day.<br/>\nI had done some dancing but they made it sort of pointless because they took away the healing ability so I trained up in dancing and then did a respec to be an architect.<br/>\nToo bad you can&#39;t have dancers in EQ.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-06-09, 08:15:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hm, they must have changed it since I played.

The band leaders can make the musicians all flourish at the same time. I&#39;m not sure if a squad leader can make the dancers all do the same flourishes but they would have to be doing the same dances. Musicians can only play the song that the first musician started.
