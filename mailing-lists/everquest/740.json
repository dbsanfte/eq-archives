When have the Rangers truly ever been upgrade?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;     1.  Given &quot;Dances with Fire Flies spell&quot;  -  wow that&#39;s a winner<br/>\n&gt;     2.  Given Critical Hits with bows  -  that&#39;s a no brainer - even<br/>\n&gt; though warriors cover all weapons<br/>\n&gt;     3.  Given Slightly Higher Caps on certain combat skills - making them<br/>\n&gt; at least similar, but lower, to the other combat classes<br/>\n&gt;     4.  Given +4 SV against fire and cold - does this really matter,<br/>\n&gt; seriously =)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s it..  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;     Sure I have track, but so do druids and bards.  Problem is, when all<br/>\n&gt; the quests and locations for MOBs are published on the internet, who needs<br/>\n&gt; that skill anymore.  I remember Brad saying that he wanted to make Rangers<br/>\n&gt; the masters of duel wield... well how bout increasing our percentages for<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Oh well...   =) Lance<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t <br/>\n&gt; \tAfter the recent upgrade to the Ranger, Paladins were certain that<br/>\n&gt; they were<br/>\n&gt; \tnext for enhancement. We waited patiently for the patch that was<br/>\n&gt; supposed to<br/>\n&gt; \tbe our salvation. Instead, what we received was armor quests that<br/>\n&gt; were 10<br/>\n&gt; \ttimes the length and 5 times more costly than any of the quest of<br/>\n&gt; any other<br/>\n&gt; \tclass. And for all of that the armor stinks. Class specific plate<br/>\n&gt; armor for<br/>\n&gt; \tthe Paladin has less AC than that of the chain worn by the ranger.<br/>\n&gt; Paladins<br/>\n&gt; \tare the &quot;Holy Knight&quot; counterpart to the ranger. Yet, with the last<br/>\n&gt; 3<br/>\n&gt; \tpatches, the Ranger has been augmented so that he has more AC even<br/>\n&gt; though he<br/>\n&gt; \tcan wear no platemail. He also has higher skill caps, does nearly<br/>\n&gt; twice the<br/>\n&gt; \tdamage in battle, has spell equivalents to most of the Paladins<br/>\n&gt; spells yet<br/>\n&gt; \tnot confined to undead. Ensnare is far more effective that root.<br/>\n&gt; Several<br/>\n&gt; \tother spells and buffs of the druid class aren&#39;t nerfed , level<br/>\n&gt; wise, as with<br/>\n&gt; \tthe paladin. The ranger can track. Whereas the paladin can point<br/>\n&gt; himself in<br/>\n&gt; \tthe direction of the nearest undead, unless of course if there is a<br/>\n&gt; pet in<br/>\n&gt; \tthe area. Now to the arguements.<br/>\n&gt; \t <br/>\n&gt; \t <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
