It&#39;s like finding pickles in a cheese burger. <br/>\nSome people hate em. Some people like em. Some people don&#39;t care. The <br/>\nalternate style in spelling makes the words a little bit harder to follow <br/>\nfor people who aren&#39;t used to the style. That annoys some people because is <br/>\nslows down their reading and they get no pleasure out of the style. Other <br/>\npeople think it&#39;s cool. I&#39;ll take my cheese burgers with or without <br/>\npickles. It&#39;s no skin off of my nose to let people enjoy what they enjoy. <br/>\nSometimes people just happen to like things that I don&#39;t. What&#39;s wrong with <br/>\nthat? Not a thing. I wish them all well. Have fun everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdward Fox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
