Meanwhile, tried again just a bit after <br/>\nmidnight this morning, and went on fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that this was just a little problem. Otherwise the conclusion <br/>\nI might draw is that, for two days at many various times, I could not <br/>\nget on because the login server was swamped. That bodes ill for all <br/>\nof us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Sony to continue the investigation even though the problem <br/>\nseems to have gone away. I want some assurance that I can get on <br/>\nwhenever I want to play. I had plans for some extended play time on <br/>\nmy days off, and they were frustrated by this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the up side, I got back to Baldur&#39;s Gate for a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nHalfling Warrior<br/>\nZeb Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
