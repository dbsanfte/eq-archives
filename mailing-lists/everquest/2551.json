He asks you to bring him two orc hatchets<br/>\n&gt; from the &quot;blue<br/>\n&gt; meanies&quot;. The merchants sell them for 6pp a piece so<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not worth buying<br/>\n&gt; them. Just look for an orc pawn that has an axe.<br/>\n&gt; Check to make sure it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; hatchet and not a rusty axe. When you have two<br/>\n&gt; hatchets, give them to you<br/>\n&gt; and he usually gives you two weapons in return. If<br/>\n&gt; you can&#39;t use them or<br/>\n&gt; think they suck, then sell them to the merchant that<br/>\n&gt; you have the best<br/>\n&gt; faction with.<br/>\n&gt; Also, if you run around the area near the lifts and<br/>\n&gt; the ruins, sometimes a<br/>\n&gt; bright green patch spawns on the ground. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; evergreen leaves. They sell<br/>\n&gt; for about 2 to 5pp a piece depending on who your<br/>\n&gt; buyer is and how much they<br/>\n&gt; want to spend.<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re high enough to go into Butcherblock then<br/>\n&gt; start to follow the path<br/>\n&gt; (right after you zone in from Faydark) and instead<br/>\n&gt; of keeping to the path,<br/>\n&gt; run straight accross to the two houses (right thru<br/>\n&gt; the pit). along the way<br/>\n&gt; Oak Bark sometimes spawns on the ground. That is an<br/>\n&gt; item that sells for a<br/>\n&gt; good price too. It&#39;s rarer.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s assuming you are a woodelf druid though.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I need to find a better Melee weapon for my young,<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her own Druid, Amaiya (Ayonae Ro).  BF had<br/>\n&gt; suggested<br/>\n&gt; &gt; asking around for a Fine Steel Scimitar but I have<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; little money right now and the guy I talked to<br/>\n&gt; last<br/>\n&gt; &gt; night wanted 10pp for the one he had...sheeeesh, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t even have 1pp yet...lol(but hey I am having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fun)..sow, no wait, that should be so, any<br/>\n&gt; suggestions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on a less expensive &quot;weapon&quot; and where i might<br/>\n&gt; find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.  I tend to hang out close to the lifts so I<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run like hell if I have to so if there is<br/>\n&gt; somewhere<br/>\n&gt; &gt; near there that would be helpful...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wishing you all safe travels..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Amaiya, the Evercurious<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Druid, Ayonae Ro (aka as Naara)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
