My <br/>\n&gt; guild is quickly growing,  and starting to do Higher <br/>\n&gt; level raids.  Many of our members have not had much <br/>\n&gt; experience raiding, so we have been doing &quot;training&quot; <br/>\n&gt; raids.  We are still having people not listening, and <br/>\n&gt; ending up causing TPW&#39;s.  If any of you have any Guids <br/>\n&gt; to raiding,  and/or rules that your guild has,  please <br/>\n&gt; send them to me so I can design something tailored to my <br/>\n&gt; guild.<br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It would help a bit knowing what you are trying to raid <br/>\n&gt; and what rules you have nw to begin with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First off, it helps to have clearly defined goals and <br/>\n&gt; loot rules for each raid you are going to do.  There is <br/>\n&gt; nothing more frustrating than going on a raid with a <br/>\n&gt; group that doesn&#39;t know what they are doing or doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; look like they know what they are doing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s also important to have a raid channel set up for <br/>\n&gt; just the Raid Leader, officers, and any group leaders.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s also important that you stress that raiding ISN&#39;T <br/>\n&gt; about getting XP, it&#39;s about accomplishing a goal <br/>\n&gt; (whether that is killing one single mob, farming for <br/>\n&gt; armor and weapons, etc..)  No one should expect to get <br/>\n&gt; any XP during a raid (in fact, some people should expect <br/>\n&gt; to lose it) and groups shouldn&#39;t be created to allow <br/>\n&gt; people to get XP (I lost a full yellow of XP on my first <br/>\n&gt; Fear raid after we had trouble breaking the zone).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for the actual fighting, NOONE should attack any mob <br/>\n&gt; until your Main Tank calls for an assist.  Make sure you <br/>\n&gt; MT has a very clear assist call.  This is probably the <br/>\n&gt; single most important point you can stress on any raid.  <br/>\n&gt; The MT should be the only person that shouold be taking <br/>\n&gt; any direct damage from the mobs on the raid (except for <br/>\n&gt; enc while they are mezzing or charming any adds)....that <br/>\n&gt; includes casters too.  The only exceptions would be <br/>\n&gt; shammys and enc debuffing and slowing the mobs while the <br/>\n&gt; MT is gaining aggro (and even then, it&#39;s the RL call <br/>\n&gt; when those groups should be doing their stuff.....you <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want a mob &quot;ping ponging&quot; between those casters <br/>\n&gt; while the MT is getting aggro).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The biggest reason why raids fail is people not <br/>\n&gt; listening.  One person can kill a raid very quickly.  <br/>\n&gt; People need to have defined roles on a raid and know <br/>\n&gt; when to use them.  And the RL needs to tell each player <br/>\n&gt; what is role is.  Dont expect people to know what you <br/>\n&gt; want them to do, tell them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sulamwen<br/>\n&gt; Outrider of &lt;Fate&#39;s Forge&gt;<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
