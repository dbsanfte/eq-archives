But to some other people<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rent-to-own basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easy to say they should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; escape for them. To<br/>\n&gt; suddenly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; financially stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nothing else. Btw, someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Where was that again? I just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; RAM with it&#39;s motherboard<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chipset. luv, -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not cost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; $265 after tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The chip is a AMD Athlon 950.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
