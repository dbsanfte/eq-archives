My son installed one on \n  our <br>computer. I have mixed feelings. When it is good it is very, very \n  <br>good. When it is bad, it sucks.<br><br>For the most part, it is nice to be \n  free of wires. This one is radio, <br>not infra-red. Not bad, until it runs \n  out of juice when you are doing <br>something important. Don&#39;t forget to put \n  it in it&#39;s docking station <br>to recharge.<br><br>If you don&#39;t put it in the \n  docking station with care, it calls up a <br>help window. That is a pain, \n  since the screen saver and monitor shut <br>off don&#39;t seem to want to work \n  while the help window is open. A <br>little care prevents this, but what a \n  pain.<br><br>The up side is that you can re-arrange your gaming hardware \n  <br>configuration to suit your tastes without worrying about the mouse \n  <br>cable. This wireless stuff may be rather nice once the bugs are <br>worked \n  out.<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br></tt><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage \n  at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
