But when in a group, I tend<br/>\nto be at the mercy of the group leader, who decides where we go and<br/>\nwhat we do.  Most of the time, they have something specific in mind,<br/>\nlike a certain drop somewhere, or lots of plat, or uber xp (Like<br/>\nNoble&#39;s Causeway).  What I like to do is just go somewhere and<br/>\nexplore.  I&#39;ve started the Slipgem quest in CC, but to do that solo is<br/>\nsuicide in the first degree when it comes to some of the higher end<br/>\nzones from Depths of Darkhollow, but so far, it&#39;s been fun.  Over the<br/>\npast several months, I&#39;ve made it a point to go to zones I&#39;ve never<br/>\nbeen to and try my hand at playing there.  To me, that&#39;s more fun than<br/>\ngrinding out xp in a plat hungry group (which I tend to find more<br/>\noften than not).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been in a couple of guilds (I&#39;m on the Povar server), one of<br/>\nwhich was run by an immature, clueless person, and one that just<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have the membership to support higher end groupage.  I have a<br/>\ncore group of people I met in my first guild, but with the invent of<br/>\nmonster missions, they have chosen to chain play those, which is<br/>\nboring to me.  I&#39;ve done a few, but the same one for 8 hours straight?<br/>\n Not me.  Anyway, thanks for the information and I&#39;ll see what I can do.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
