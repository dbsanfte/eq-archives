I sometimes keep items around to give to newbies later. Even when my<br/>\ndruid was only lvl 10 I would turn in CB belts and come back with armor to<br/>\ngive to low lvls.<br/>\nIt&#39;s actually part of my guild practice to help others. The Spellbinders<br/>\npride ourselves on being kind to others. The other day a guy was stuck in a<br/>\npit in West Freeport. he was diseased and couldn&#39;t move around without<br/>\ngetting killed from the disease/dot. He didnt know how to get out and had<br/>\nless than 40hp left. So I called a wizard guildmate to TL him to his bind<br/>\npoint. I waited at his bind point to heal and cure him. It felt good to help<br/>\nsomeone. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; This is exactly what happened to me.  i had asked if<br/>\n&gt; anyone could help a young druid stand a fighting<br/>\n&gt; chance on her own...i was meaning just buffs...along<br/>\n&gt; came this WONDERFUL person who suited me with some<br/>\n&gt; basic leather armor and gave me 50pp to boot to help<br/>\n&gt; buy my spells...i was amazed!!!  He said he was<br/>\n&gt; fulfilling a promise...i will be glad to one day have<br/>\n&gt; the opportunity to give back to another who is just<br/>\n&gt; starting out...What is it they say...&quot;Pay It<br/>\n&gt; Forward&quot;??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **hugs**<br/>\n&gt; Amaiya, Fennin Ro Druid, Loyal to Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Su &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Heh.

The other day some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guy gave me 100pp just for emoting something.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And high lvl druids have been nice to my druid.
