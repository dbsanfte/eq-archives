Myself, I haven&#39;t<br/>\nexperienced any of the bugs most ppl have been<br/>\ncomplaining about, so I guess I got lucky. The lag<br/>\ngets to me sometimes, but that&#39;s because I got the<br/>\ncheapest 64 meg card I could get away with, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, it&#39;s so nice to be able to do something other<br/>\nthan kill kill kill the same ole monsters over and<br/>\nover again.
