I rock! Last night I was playing my Gnome<br/>\nWarrior Genmay, I had just hit lvl13, got my dual weild skill, and was<br/>\nhunting Minos in Ak&#39;Anon. Well I go in and pull what I think is just one out<br/>\nof the cave but in all reality is actually four slavers! I change to one of<br/>\nthe wide views and realize my delima. Figuring that I would probably die<br/>\nbefore I got to the guard and even then he wouldn&#39;t be much help I decide to<br/>\npull up my boots and lay into them and at least try to do as much damage as<br/>\npossible. I changed from my two Mino battle axes to my Graoning Mace to give<br/>\nme a little better chance of taking at least one, maybe two slavers out<br/>\nbefore I die. So far i&#39;m doing pretty good! I&#39;ve killed one and really<br/>\nwailing on another when I get attacked by a stupid giant infected rat! &quot;Oh<br/>\ngreat!&quot; I thought figuring my fate was sealed. I ignore the rat and keep<br/>\nwailing on the Minos. Luckily somone was nice enough to come by and kill the<br/>\nrat for me. By this time I was down to one bub!<br/>\n&gt; ble of life left and still two Minos to go. I finish off the one I&#39;ve been<br/>\nworking on and go right after the last one. &quot;I&#39;m dead so I might as well die<br/>\nwith my boots on!&quot; I thought, Well suddenly the mino takes off and starts<br/>\nrunning away! &quot;Holy cow! I might make this!&quot; I take off after him and<br/>\nfinally kill him.<br/>\n&gt; So now I&#39;m standing there with a smidgen of a bubble left for life, 4 dead<br/>\nmino slavers and a giant diseased rat at my feet. &quot;I have just taken out 4<br/>\nmino slavers! RRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&quot; I yell. That felt so good!<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\">http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
