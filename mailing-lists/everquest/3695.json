I only <br/>\nhave two so far. Need three to make my first attempt at the <br/>\ncombination. That is just the beginning for making the bags.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I got tired of camping Brutes in Warsliks Woods, so finally made <br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; journey to Velious.

Level 34 puts me low on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; food chain in EW.

They took me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down twice more in the next fifteen minutes. Found someone else<br/>\n&gt; &gt; contending with them when I resurrected.

Solo at 34 in EW seems a <br/>\nbit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tough, even if I need the tufts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are the direwolf tufts only for hafling tailoring?<br/>\n&gt; I keep seeing them dropped on the ground near the bank. If they can <br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; foraged I think you can forage them in GD and Thurgadin. GD seems <br/>\nto have<br/>\n&gt; less mobs. There are some spots that are safer to hunt. There&#39;s a <br/>\nspot where<br/>\n&gt; you can just get the wolves and if you get into trouble you can run <br/>\nto the<br/>\n&gt; coldain wolves and guards for help.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
