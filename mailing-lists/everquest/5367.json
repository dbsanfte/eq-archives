I finally did it!<br/>\nI failed a combine a couple times and lost two runed sea shells (which were<br/>\nthe most expensive thing I had to buy for it-- I tried hunting in SG but<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have any luck). I got my JC to 173, my tailoring to 176, fletching to<br/>\n180, brewing to 184, pottery to 154, and smithing to 112. I got impatient on<br/>\nthe pottery and just asked someone to put the water and the velium powder<br/>\n(made from the runed sea shell and a small brick of velium in a mortar and<br/>\npestle-- no fail combine) in a pottery wheel and got my Unfired Rune. I<br/>\nfired the rune. I bought a geerlok gemsetter. Borrowed a geerlok planing<br/>\ntool for my fletching for the combines. and borrowed a geerlok sewing kit<br/>\nfor the final combine. Had C3 on and success!!<br/>\nI now have my Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl!<br/>\nNow I need to work on JC and Smithing some more for my 8th shawl...<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.544 / Virus Database: 338 - Release Date: 11/25/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
