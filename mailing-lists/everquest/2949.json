The halfling can go most","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-444069454\">The previously posted advice covers most of what you asked. As a <br/>\ncasual gamer and rpg fan, you will do very well as a halfling druid. <br/>\nThe halfling can go most places with little concern for faction (how <br/>\nyou get along with other races.) The druid can port around, so you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to depend on others for travel. You can fight well enough <br/>\nget by, and have lots of good spells. I think halfling druid is a <br/>\ngreat first character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many good help sites on the net. Research is part of a good <br/>\ngame, and there is a great deal to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe druid is very good for groups, as they can heal (though not so <br/>\nwell as a cleric) and can help the group with track and with rooting <br/>\nor snaring prey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend building a map library from sites like EQATLAS. It helps <br/>\na lot to know a bit about a zone before going there. Unless breaching <br/>\nthe unknown is a thrill for you. I do that a bit, but having to spend <br/>\nhours working out how to get to your corpse in a place you should not <br/>\nyet have been is not particularly thrilling. Well, maybe the first <br/>\ntime, but not something to do often.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you plan to upgrade right away, just trilogy should be fine <br/>\nfor quite some time. For Luclin you need the biggest and fastest <br/>\nthing you can afford to buy or build. Not worth waiting for. Get <br/>\ntrilogy and get gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nHalfling Druid lvl 32<br/>\nZeb server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;quiller64&quot; &lt;jflip64@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi all, <br/>\n&gt; Having been a fan of computer RPG&#39;s for years I am considering <br/>\ntrying <br/>\n&gt; EQ. Having never played an online rpg before I have a few <br/>\nquestions ?<br/>\n&gt; (Forgive my lack of knowledge and feel free to laugh at my <br/>\nquestions)<br/>\n&gt; 1. Being used to playing solo games I could pretty much play at my <br/>\n&gt; own pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other online players <br/>\nbut <br/>\n&gt; seeing as I am a casual gamer i only spend  10-15 hours a week <br/>\ngaming <br/>\n&gt; is this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play occurs with whoever <br/>\n&gt; is online at the time and am I not tied into a specific group/times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join with? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kharnak, etc) does it <br/>\n&gt; matter which one I start with or are the later addons geared for <br/>\n&gt; higher level characters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the system requirements <br/>\n&gt; but what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866, 128sdram, 32mb ddr <br/>\nnvidia <br/>\n&gt; geforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or should I wait <br/>\n&gt; till I upgrade.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any feedback </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
