I was so crazy for EQ I made characters on her account.  Read <br/>\nforums if you can&#39;t get enough EQ from the books you have. <br/>\nEQtraders.com has good tradeskills discussions if you are interested in <br/>\nthem, eqlive.station.sony.com has the &#39;official&#39; forums, <br/>\neverquest.allakhazam.com has forums for EQ and many other games too, <br/>\neg.crgaming.com/forums is still working as of last night even though the <br/>\nmain Caster&#39;s Realm site has been down.<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s also newsgroups, alt.games.everquest is the active one, if <br/>\nyou can&#39;t get newsgroups on your email client (I use netscape&#39;s client) <br/>\n  try groups.google.com, you have to make an account to post but you can <br/>\nread the postings without one.  I get alot of EQ info out of that group. <br/>\n  If you use google, there will be alot of spam, just ignore it, DO NOT <br/>\nreply to any of them, you won&#39;t make any friends in the group that way. <br/>\n  Also basic newsgroup ettiquette:  the posting snobs (not me) will get <br/>\nupset if you top-post; never ever use HTML to post, plain text only; <br/>\nanything OT, plainly mark OT or the aforementioned snobs will get upset <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun and get home safely<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello me again lol.  Yeah I&#39;d love to go to all those forums and websites,<br/>\nonly problem is there is no internet on this ship.  I got lucky in Bahrain<br/>\nwhen we had internet on the ship for a couple days and I was able to have<br/>\nthis ship email address registered in Yahoo.  Hopefully we&#39;ll  have internet<br/>\nagain sometime in our ports and I&#39;ll be able to check out some of those<br/>\nforums and sites, until then I got my books to sustain me lol.  Well talk to<br/>\nyou later! <br/>\n=)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
