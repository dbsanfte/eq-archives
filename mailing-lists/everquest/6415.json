Whenever you are <br/>\n&gt; low on mana, every spell fizzles. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When in doubt, gate. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is not a single bathroom in all of Norrath. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Armor Class of a piece of armor is inversely proportional as to <br/>\n&gt; how good it looks on you. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The item that you want the most drops the rarest. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The item that you want the most is out of your price range. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The item that you want the most was sold at an auction while you <br/>\n&gt; were offline. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The item that you want the most was picked up by some moron who <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know the definition of &quot;No Drop&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The item you&#39;ll need tomorrow is No Rent. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The item you accidentally drop will be the most <br/>\n&gt; valuable/powerful/important item you carry. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you can afford it, it&#39;s not for sale. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want two of them, it&#39;s a Lore item. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want to sell it, it&#39;s a No Drop item. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The High Quality Bear Skin drops every 28 days, the same schedule as <br/>\n&gt; PMS. Coincidence? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even greens kill. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Backstab means never having to say you&#39;re sorry. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A bow without arrows seems awfully heavy all of a sudden. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Merchants are perfectly capable of kicking tail and taking names. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Trains have the right of way. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If it&#39;s stupid but it works, it isn&#39;t stupid. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The guards are never there when you need them. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Misuse of a combine button in a hurry = highly colorful language. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The time it takes to upload the newest patch is directly <br/>\n&gt; proportional to your eagerness to log on. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No two people have ever agreed on a single, precise definition of a <br/>\n&gt; twink. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Never forget that your newbie weapon was crafted by the lowest <br/>\n&gt; bidder. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A roleplayer drinks to increase his alcohol tolerance; an idiot does <br/>\n&gt; it in the Kelethin treetops. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having a tenth of a bubble of health left is Nature&#39;s way of telling <br/>\n&gt; you to slow down. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gnome wizards are proof positive that size does not matter. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The greatest mystery in Norrath is how NPCs figure out what religion <br/>\n&gt; you are just by looking at you. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Every shaman on Norrath at one point in his or her life has done the <br/>\n&gt; pig joke when someone asked for a SOW. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Only twelve people in all of Norrath are truly happy with their last <br/>\n&gt; names. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The last bubble takes forever to fill. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is somehow discouraging to realize that Qeynos is &quot;SonyEQ&quot; <br/>\n&gt; spelled backwards. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Sometimes, just sometimes, you dream too hard....and everything shatters... there&#39;s nothing left to do but pick up the pieces and go on...hoping time will be kind enough to heal your wounds.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.msn.com/mistayakiara/\">http://groups.msn.com/mistayakiara/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/mistayakiara/\">http://www.livejournal.com/users/mistayakiara/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Never stop believing that, if nothing else, things change, and evolve into the light, and all chaos will cease.
