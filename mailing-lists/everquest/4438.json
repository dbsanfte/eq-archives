I have a GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128mb vid card. My<br/>\nsystem is good. but my phone lines are horrible.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wow. WW is what now? warsilk woods? What lvl are they?<br/>\n&gt; sorry... forgot about that zone... i was referring to Western Wastes.<br/>\n&gt; and the right name of the wolves is &quot;Velium Hounds&quot;. the wolves<br/>\n&gt; are 49 to 51 i think and i can only solo them pet-chaining. one wolf<br/>\n&gt; needs up to four, sometimes five (air) pets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahh. No good for me cuz I can&#39;t have pets and can&#39;t solo. lol.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; getting there can be sort of an adventure for non-porters:<br/>\n&gt;     Cobalt Scar -&gt; Siren&#39;s Grotto -&gt; Western Wastes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahh.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; it is really nice to have a wizzy and druid alt... especially<br/>\n&gt; if they are on another account and you have more than one<br/>\n&gt; system to play... :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can barely stay connected with one account... I only get about 9k<br/>\nbandwidth if one other person uses the &#39;net on my network.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; and having a cleric on a third account with even one more<br/>\n&gt; system availible to play, makes me feel much better hunting<br/>\n&gt; there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh, I wouldn&#39;t be able to even open the patch checker with that many<br/>\naccounts.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; huh... did i mention i am maxxed ally on CoV faction (those<br/>\n&gt; drakes in Skyshrine)... also most of my alts have good CoV<br/>\n&gt; faction... it makes it much easier to stay alive in WW.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m dubious or indifferent. :-)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; actually there aren&#39;t many critters i could hunt in WW without<br/>\n&gt; hurting my CoV faction. well, and if there is one of those wurms,<br/>\n&gt; i just run... or gate...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh. :-)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; here is the link to the mobs:<br/>\n&gt;     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=108\">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=108</a><br/>\n&gt; think of this zone like the sandy area of South Ro:<br/>\n&gt;  - replace the sand with ice... looks almost like eastern wastes<br/>\n&gt;  - replace all the undead with wyverns (CoV faction)<br/>\n&gt;  - replace all the spiders with (named) drakes (CoV faction)<br/>\n&gt;  - add some Brontos<br/>\n&gt;  - add many Ice Burrower (really big wurms)<br/>\n&gt;  - add _some_ Velium Hounds<br/>\n&gt;  - add some more things that want to kill you...<br/>\n&gt;  - and of course some NPCs<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>oh I hate icy snowy stuff. Whenever it snows I get disconnected. and I tend<br/>\nto go LD while running over snow/ice graphics for some odd reason.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yeah, but by the time I can actually hit a key I&#39;m kicked. :-( It takes<br/>\n </span></blockquote>me<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; 10 minutes to zone in and then boom. disconnected.<br/>\n&gt; argl... this is pretty ugly... :-(((<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; maybe switch to top-down-view before entering the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t, see, I always zonecrash if I zone in from shadowhaven or bazaar. And<br/>\nthen I have to restart EQ and try to enter. Every other time I manage to get<br/>\nin but immediately go LD. Hence why I had to have a GM move me.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; my smallest system (p2/300, 512mb, tnt2) has some problems with<br/>\n&gt; the game (old zones are the fastest), but still works pretty good.<br/>\n&gt; actually i use that system for my trader and bazaar is no problem at<br/>\n&gt; all. about zoning: it is faster than all my other systems...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cool.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; the bigger systems are a notebook and a desktop, each with a<br/>\n&gt; P3 (notebook 1.12GHz, desktop 933MHz) and nVidia chips<br/>\n&gt; (notebook geforce 2 go, desktop geforce 3 ti550). all systems<br/>\n&gt; have a fixed swap file with 4095MB (limitation is because of<br/>\n&gt; windows 2k, i think XP can use bigger ones). most EQ options<br/>\n&gt; are turned off, no music, &quot;not much&quot; sound.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a great sound card on mine. :-) And a good processor, good RAM, good<br/>\nmodem, great vid card... But my phone company is retarded and gave me<br/>\nspliced lines so it&#39;s impossible for me to connect at more than 20kbps.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; the notebook gets slower in bazaar at a resolution of 1024x768.<br/>\n&gt; the desktop hasn&#39;t too many problems even at 1600x1200. other<br/>\n&gt; zones, like wakening lands (eg with many trees, and other stuff)<br/>\n&gt; or some of the new LoY zones give those boxes very much<br/>\n&gt; trouble.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use the lowest resolution possible bc the next lowest makes the text too<br/>\nsmall for me to read easily.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; all my systems are connected to the internet using a PPC/G4<br/>\n&gt; based linux system connected to DSL (actually the german<br/>\n&gt; &quot;T-DSL&quot; variant). the major problems i have is the connection<br/>\n&gt; to the states... on the other hand, sometimes it is hard to believe<br/>\n&gt; that the servers (eg Tarew Marr) is located overseas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My computer is the server. DSL and cable internet are not available to me. I<br/>\nsupport a network of 4 other computers. my brother is almost ALWAYS on and<br/>\nwhen he sends an IM or loads a webpage, if I&#39;m in EQ I get kicked out. :-(<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
