All you needed to do was to constantly spam<br/>\n&gt; the group with <br/>\n&gt; text in the language you wanted to teach, assuming<br/>\n&gt; of course, you <br/>\n&gt; knew the language.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   It&#39;s not uncommon for a guide or gm to make<br/>\n&gt; claims about the game <br/>\n&gt; as it is or was and for those claims to be totally<br/>\n&gt; baseless, I <br/>\n&gt; suspect that they lie as often as not.  Keep in mind<br/>\n&gt; that the <br/>\n&gt; development team recently suggested that people<br/>\n&gt; could interupt a <br/>\n&gt; spell being cast on horseback by making a hotkey<br/>\n&gt; that consisted of <br/>\n&gt; two lines, /dismount and /duck<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Anyone wanna explain why that won&#39;t work? <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s two reasons I <br/>\n&gt; know of offhand.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; &gt;     From: Kittin LovesYou <br/>\n&gt; &gt;     To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Sent: Wednesday, May 07, 2003 2:32 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Subject: [EverQuest] Languages<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;     I was curious what has changed about the<br/>\n&gt; languages.  I used to <br/>\n&gt; be able to teach a language to my group and get<br/>\n&gt; better at it.  This <br/>\n&gt; is no longer so, and I talked to a GM who told me<br/>\n&gt; this was never so.  <br/>\n&gt; I was also told that something changed in respect to<br/>\n&gt; languages and <br/>\n&gt; zoning or something.  I am quite curious about this,<br/>\n&gt; as I am trying <br/>\n&gt; to learn every language I can.  I was also curious<br/>\n&gt; if you could teach <br/>\n&gt; over your own knowledge in the language.
