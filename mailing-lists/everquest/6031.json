Another<br/>\n&gt; question I have for <br/>\n&gt; you is what type of armor did you start out with?<br/>\n&gt; Were you twinked?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to rip on you or put you down for<br/>\n&gt; getting PL&#39;d but what I <br/>\n&gt; am saying here is not everyone can go this route.<br/>\n&gt; You offer a great way <br/>\n&gt; to do it but again not everyone can do this. Now<br/>\n&gt; with EQ2 out and all <br/>\n&gt; the ubers moving over to it, you hardly ever find<br/>\n&gt; any on anymore and <br/>\n&gt; those that are don&#39;t want to waste their time with a<br/>\n&gt; lowbie when the <br/>\n&gt; camp they have been trying to get access to for the<br/>\n&gt; past 3 months to <br/>\n&gt; finish their epic is now free. Plus not everyone has<br/>\n&gt; all the expans yet <br/>\n&gt; and may not be able to get to some of those zones<br/>\n&gt; you mention. Not to <br/>\n&gt; mention the time to play. Not everyone has 4 days<br/>\n&gt; they can play. I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; lucky I can get 1 full day half the time! Again I<br/>\n&gt; congradulate you on <br/>\n&gt; your achievements.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now for those that are really that desperate (and<br/>\n&gt; stupid enough to give <br/>\n&gt; full access to their account to a perfect stranger),<br/>\n&gt; you can try this <br/>\n&gt; out! <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=4596&item=8154542079&rd=1\">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=4596&item=8154542079&rd=1</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good luck to all you young adventurers!<br/>\n&gt; Durgaa Silveroak<br/>\n&gt; Norrathian Ranger of the 35th season.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 2         <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Mon, 20 Dec 2004 22:43:10 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;shadow_4unme&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadow_4unme@...\">shadow_4unme@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: power lvling 101<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the ends and out about power lvling is simple. get<br/>\n&gt; temp from a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric, get a druid. druid casts regn, str, damage<br/>\n&gt; shield, sow. goto <br/>\n&gt; &gt; field of bone hit mob once move on, kill anything<br/>\n&gt; that walks away. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; make sure druid is healing you. lvl 12 goto kurns<br/>\n&gt; tower ( off field <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of bone ). kill in kurns tower to lvl 20 or intill<br/>\n&gt; something looks <br/>\n&gt; &gt; green or light blue. goto paludal caverns lvl<br/>\n&gt; there the same way hit <br/>\n&gt; &gt; mob once and move on. work your way to back<br/>\n&gt; tunnels and kill <br/>\n&gt; &gt; shrinkens once there light  blue take the camps at<br/>\n&gt; zone in. from Here <br/>\n&gt; &gt; you should be well on your way and zone choice can<br/>\n&gt; be done by you or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the druid.  Paw is mine it is getting nerfed soon.<br/>\n&gt;  I can lvl there <br/>\n&gt; &gt; till late 35 or so. You could also goto into<br/>\n&gt; Crystal Caverns at 30 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for power lvling. Usualy by the time iam lvl 40<br/>\n&gt; the druid is sick of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; lvling me and i solo dawn shroud peak has zelnicks<br/>\n&gt; thay are cake for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a power lvled twinked player least it hasnt failed<br/>\n&gt; me. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for you who say spells spells spells. have<br/>\n&gt; powerlvled warrior, monk, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric, enchanter, rogue, all to lvl 40. then<br/>\n&gt; soloed 40-50 and my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; skills where maxed from soloing. the coin you get<br/>\n&gt; plus the 5 points <br/>\n&gt; &gt; each lvl you can easly bring skills up spells to<br/>\n&gt; comp you at lvl 40 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get by. each class has a main spell class bring<br/>\n&gt; it and evocation <br/>\n&gt; &gt; up.  and the rest come in short order. I have only<br/>\n&gt; seen one person <br/>\n&gt; &gt; power lvled so hard he couldnt cast. But normaly<br/>\n&gt; you will work <br/>\n&gt; &gt; something up it does take time. and your melee<br/>\n&gt; skills will be maxed, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; if not close, my rogue i just started not only<br/>\n&gt; maxed pierceing but <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1hs as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  You may not want or like power lvling how ever i<br/>\n&gt; see nothing wrong <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with pling to 40 soloing to 50 before i begain my<br/>\n&gt; grouping career. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; todayes game has drop gear cheap to make an old<br/>\n&gt; school 65 war on a 40 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; war. so grping with people at lvls below 55 are<br/>\n&gt; slaying the mobs. its <br/>\n&gt; &gt; not like it was when the game came out, and grps<br/>\n&gt; realy did need <br/>\n&gt; &gt; players below 55 to play well. even my rouge can<br/>\n&gt; tank still at 46. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dont sweat lvl 70 because you not going to get<br/>\n&gt; there in a day. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;     lvl 46 rogue in 4 days played less than two<br/>\n&gt; weeks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nYahoo!
