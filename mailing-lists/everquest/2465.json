I have seen the gforce 2 <br/>\nfor about $45. I am wondering if I can expect much improved <br/>\nperformance with the gforce 2. Both are pci, both 32k. I get lots of <br/>\nlag in Rivervale, most of Luclin, and some of the other cities. Not <br/>\neverywhere, just where lots of people gather and the backgrounds are <br/>\ngraphics intensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have the money to go for the gforce 3, and I don&#39;t even know <br/>\nif the 3 comes in pci format. I need another hard disk as well as <br/>\ndoing a graphics upgrade, so the money needs to stay around that $45.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would want a very obvious improvement to even bother with the <br/>\nupgrade on the graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nZeb server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
