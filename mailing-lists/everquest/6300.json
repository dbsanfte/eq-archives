It contains all the \n  information you will<br>&gt; need to hit the ground running and make the most \n  of<br>&gt; your time in beta. Remember, you accepted the<br>&gt; EverQuest \n  Terms of Use, License and Non-Disclosure<br>&gt; Agreement as a condition for \n  acceptance into the<br>&gt; beta program, and everything included here as \n  well<br>&gt; as what you see on the beta server, in beta-related<br>&gt; \n  communications and beta forums and message boards<br>&gt; are covered by that \n  agreement. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW DO I GET ON THE BETA SERVER?<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; In order to access the Depths of Darkhollow beta<br>&gt; server, you \n  will need to download the Beta patcher.<br>&gt; The FTP site for downloading \n  the patcher is listed<br>&gt; below. There may be a lot of data to download, \n  so<br>&gt; please be patient.&nbsp; You should run this patcher<br>&gt; before \n  you log in, every time.&nbsp; Failing to do so may<br>&gt; cause you to \n  experience crashes or gameplay issues<br>&gt; that could be fixed just by \n  patching.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; You may download the Depths of Darkhollow \n  beta<br>&gt; patcher at the following FTP site<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; FTP \n  Site omitted due to NDA.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; To get to the ftp \n  site:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Enter the ftp address into your Internet \n  Explorer<br>&gt; web browser.&nbsp; It will bring you to the ftp site. \n  The<br>&gt; file you need is called EQBetaPatcher.zip.&nbsp; Just<br>&gt; \n  right click on the file and copy it to your desktop.<br>&gt;&nbsp; Unzip the \n  file and copy betaeverquest.exe into your<br>&gt; root EverQuest directory \n  (Should be in C:&#92;Program<br>&gt; Files&#92;Sony&#92;EverQuest unless you changed your \n  default<br>&gt; installation.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Run this every time prior to \n  logging in to the beta<br>&gt; server. You will see the Beta Server on the \n  server<br>&gt; list, choose that server and log in.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  HOW LONG IS BETA?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The beta test is scheduled to begin on July \n  20th,<br>&gt; 2005 and is scheduled to end on September 13th,<br>&gt; 2005, \n  unless we decide to change these dates.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW DO I GET \n  TO THE DoD ZONES?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; When you get onto the beta server, create \n  your<br>&gt; character and head to the Plane of Knowledge. Find<br>&gt; Old \n  Man Thorren and he can teleport you to Corathus<br>&gt; Creep.<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW DO I COPY MY CHARACTER ONTO BETA?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For \n  us to copy your favorite EverQuest character to<br>&gt; the beta server, \n  please indicate which character you<br>&gt; want us to copy by logging into \n  your play server as<br>&gt; your favorite character. You indicate that you \n  want<br>&gt; us to copy an individual character by typing the<br>&gt; command \n  /beta in your chat window. Periodically we<br>&gt; will run scripts that will \n  copy characters to the<br>&gt; beta server. Keep in mind that we will be \n  running<br>&gt; the character copies on an as-needed basis - not<br>&gt; \n  necessarily at regular intervals. It may take<br>&gt; several days for us to \n  copy your character.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; THE /betabuff COMMAND<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; The level range needed to test all of the variations<br>&gt; of \n  dungeons for&nbsp; DoD is huge.&nbsp; In order to give you<br>&gt; that \n  ability to test as much of the expansion as<br>&gt; possible, we have created \n  a /betabuff command. <br>&gt; Here&#39;s how you use it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. \n  Create a first level character on the beta server<br>&gt; and log in with that \n  character (this command will<br>&gt; only work on 1st level \n  characters).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. Type /betabuff CLASS LEVEL - where CLASS is \n  the<br>&gt; class of the character you would like to create, and<br>&gt; LEVEL \n  is the level that you want that character to<br>&gt; be.&nbsp; LEVEL can only \n  be numbers divisible by 5,<br>&gt; starting at 20.&nbsp; So 20, 25, 30, \n  etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That&#39;s it.&nbsp; The character you created will \n  be<br>&gt; transformed into a character of the level and class<br>&gt; you \n  have chosen.&nbsp; Your race and even gender may<br>&gt; change as \n  well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; BETA FEEDBACK<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There are two \n  methods for passing information to us<br>&gt; about what you experience during \n  the beta.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; /bug should be used to report bugs.&nbsp; Bugs \n  are<br>&gt; gameplay features that do not work, spelling errors,<br>&gt; and \n  anything that just does not work as intended. <br>&gt; Please give us as much \n  detail about the bug as you<br>&gt; can think of when reporting it.<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; /feedback should be used to send in comments about<br>&gt; parts of \n  the expansion that work properly, but that<br>&gt; you would like to see \n  changed.&nbsp; If you discover an<br>&gt; item that you think should have less \n  Wis and more<br>&gt; Int, then use /feedback.&nbsp; If you think a \n  certain<br>&gt; encounter is too easy or too hard, use /feedback to<br>&gt; \n  report it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It is important that you distinguish between \n  these<br>&gt; two options, as one is read primarily by our testing<br>&gt; \n  team and the other is read mostly by our game<br>&gt; designers.&nbsp; Sending \n  a bug through /feedback can<br>&gt; delay our ability to fix it, since we&#39;ll \n  have to<br>&gt; route that to our testers for verification.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  Please use this command to explore as many of the<br>&gt; adventures as you \n  can and report your findings to<br>&gt; us.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you find \n  yourself in dire need of assistance, you<br>&gt; can use /petition to contact \n  us for help.&nbsp; Please<br>&gt; only petition if the situation is one that \n  you can&#39;t<br>&gt; correct yourself.&nbsp; For example, if you used<br>&gt; \n  /betabuff to create a character and you have lost<br>&gt; the corpse, there is \n  no need to /petition.&nbsp; You can<br>&gt; just log out, create a new \n  character and use the<br>&gt; /betabuff command again.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Please \n  remember that your participation in the beta<br>&gt; program is subject to the \n  Terms of Use, License and<br>&gt; Non-Disclosure Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) which \n  you<br>&gt; have already agreed to. Your access in and to the<br>&gt; beta \n  program, including the patcher, is for your<br>&gt; personal, non-commercial \n  use only, in accordance<br>&gt; with the Agreement, and any feedback you \n  provide is<br>&gt; confidential.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you for your time and \n  effort; we appreciate<br>&gt; your help testing this expansion.<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; Sincerely,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The EverQuest Depths of \n  Darkhollow Development Team<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  <br><br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do You \n  Yahoo!?<br>Tired of spam?&nbsp; Yahoo!
