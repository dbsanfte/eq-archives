I am new to this mailing list so I thought I would give a word<br/>\nor many of introduction.  At this point I would introduce myself as my main,<br/>\nbut since I&#39;m still undecided as to who my main actually is, I will tell you<br/>\nabout my characters and how this all began.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started playing EverQuest a little over a year ago.  The first character I<br/>\never created was a half elf rogue by the name of Wulfric Rennison who is<br/>\ncurrently level 31.  Since Wulfric I have created a druid who originally<br/>\nstarted out as a half elf until I realized druids are wisdom based casters<br/>\nand half elves don&#39;t have much wisdom.  So I deleted the druid at level 15<br/>\nand recreated him as a wood elf.  His name is Raido Covenfall.  Currently he<br/>\nis level 40.  Wulfric and Raido are really my two mains, though Wulfric<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get played much.  I mainly use Raido to earn plat to buy better gear<br/>\nfor Wulfric.  Then my two lesser characters are Celric Feldrak (an anagram<br/>\nfor &quot;dark elf cleric&quot; in case you didn&#39;t catch it) a level 20 currently<br/>\nworking on faction in Qeynos for the Testament of Vanear quest, and Savawulf<br/>\nTageric (a combination of two words - Savatage and Wulfric.  Savatage being<br/>\nmy favorite band and Wulfric you already know.  Wulfric incidentally is made<br/>\nof two words &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;reich&quot;.).  Those are all on the Cazic Thule server.<br/>\nIf you see one of them sometime, feel free to send a tell.  Then I have<br/>\nvarious characters on other servers, the primary ones being Kenjite Arimasen<br/>\n(in Japanese means &quot;There are no forbidden subjects&quot;), currently a level 18<br/>\nwood elf druid, and Petrus Steelsinger (so named for Peter Steele, front man<br/>\nfor the band Type O Negative), who, of course, is a bard half elf, currently<br/>\nlevel 11 and rarely played.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these characters are in various guilds.  Raido and Celric are both<br/>\ntagged in the guild &quot;Amicus Concordiam&quot;.   Wulfric and Savawulf are tagged<br/>\nto the guild &quot;Draconis Rampant&quot;.  Kenjite and Petrus are tagged to the guild<br/>\n&quot;Bane of Tunare&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have many friends who play online, and I am also responsible for getting<br/>\nseveral people addicted.  I love the game, I don&#39;t plan on quitting any time<br/>\nsoon, and I believe that if I ever get married, my wife will have to be an<br/>\nEQ addict as well!  Oh yeah... and she has to like cartoons and kung fu<br/>\nmovies... but that&#39;s neither here nor there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for what it&#39;s worth... I don&#39;t really have a life outside of EQ.  :b<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you online!!<br/>\nSend me a tell!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAluve Norrathians!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWulfric/Raido/Celric/Savawulf/Kenjite/Petrus<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Friends In Unity&quot;<br/>\n&quot;CHAOS to All Our Foes&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(PS Hi Kwasi!)   :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
