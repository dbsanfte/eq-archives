But I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\nI am still pissed at him about it. I lost all the xp I&#39;d earned that day bc<br/>\nof his stupid actions.

In my guild I have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; friend,we&#39;ll just call her Luv. Luvs ex-boyfriend, Shift (that is his<br/>\n </span></blockquote>actual<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; character name on The Tribunal), was jealous that a married player gave<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Luv<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; an item.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They ended up breaking up.

Went to the zones she went to.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; asked him to leave her alone. he would still harass her. So, we&#39;re on a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild raid and he shows up. He buffs me and is really polite. I thank<br/>\n </span></blockquote>him<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; and am polite to him. Then Luv explains that he is her ex. He comes up<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; starts insulting her equipment. Saying stuff like &quot;That&#39;s a pathetic<br/>\n </span></blockquote>staff&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; and stuff like that. She politely responds &quot;Well, it&#39;s the best I can<br/>\n </span></blockquote>get at<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; my level&quot;. He makes some other snide remark. She tells me in group that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>he&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; annoying her. He makes her feel threatened. He goes away for awhile bc<br/>\n </span></blockquote>we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; start fighting stuff.

I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>said<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &quot;So you&#39;re here because..?&quot; He said he was going to pull a train to us.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>then<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; he shouts &quot;Where is my train?&quot; I tell him &quot;no no no.

I see Shift outside and say &quot;You got me killed!&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>he<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; turns and runs from me. I say &quot;Hey!&quot; and he just runs off and camps.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t even have the decency to apologize to me. And he did it all to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; at his ex-gf. Jerk. I petitioned as soon as I had come back from being<br/>\n </span></blockquote>dead.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; but he still logged before any GM answered Luv&#39;s petition. The GM never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; answered mine.
