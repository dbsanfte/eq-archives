I took the boat, just to have done it once. Found <br/>\nmy way to Eastern Wastes. Started foraging the tufts of dire wolf fur <br/>\nI need for advancing my tailoring. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have not been fortunate in hunting. Level 34 puts me low on the <br/>\nfood chain in EW. I have tried my standard hunting routine from the <br/>\nfoot of the bridge, but have been beaten back to the zone repeatedly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis last time, I crossed the zone to get away from a mob, and was <br/>\ninstantly killed by some kind of tracking wolf pack. They took me <br/>\ndown twice more in the next fifteen minutes. Found someone else <br/>\ncontending with them when I resurrected. He being a higher level <br/>\noffered to train them away, and did so. I got my corpse and got my <br/>\nstuff back, but am now a high 33 again. <br/>\n<br/>\nI may have to rethink my Velious career. Solo at 34 in EW seems a bit <br/>\ntough, even if I need the tufts.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
