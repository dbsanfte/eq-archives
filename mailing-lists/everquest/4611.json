The warrior class is very dependant on weapons that have \nan aggro producing proc attached on them. These weapons have an ok damage/delay \nbut this has very little to do with the warrior actually holding aggro. In my \nopinion this makes the warrior class somewhat broken, but thats another story \nand wasnt part of the discussion.</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">There \nare several weapons that have this some better some worse. Like the warrior \nepic, blade of carnage, Blade of war for example. Blade of war has the big \nadvantage of beeing a 2hander to not having to take high ripostes. This is \nabsolutely neccessary in some fights to keep the MT alive.</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">Put 2 \nwarriors beside each other on a mob have them taunt away, one using a &quot;turbo&quot; \ndamage/delay weapon without a proc and the other with blade of war and I can \nguarantee who will hold aggro. Every time, all the time. </font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">As for \ngiving an example on why you dont want to take ripostes, imagine fighting \nanything that hits 2000 or higher, and then imagine two ripostes instead of one. \nThats a pretty big difference. Or imagine fighting a 3600 quadding mob, it can \noneround you without defensive disc, try putting a SK or PAlly on this and the \nfight is over before it started. Im not saying that this is your average fight, \nbut the do happen quite a bit. The &quot;tankability&quot; of a warrior &gt;&gt; any other \nclass. The main problem is holding the aggro.</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">On \nnormal exp mobs a Pally or SK works fine as tank, or on special mobs with aggro \nwipes (some mobs memblur themselves for example) or mobs that proc detaunt on \nMT. In these situations it can be troublesome to usea Warrior as MT cause the \naggro a warrior produces takes a little time, and if its wiped every other round \nit wont be firm aggro, taunting factor on sk or pally is high and is easier to \ncontrol. But these kind of mobs typically arent very hard hitters to make them \ntankable for these non defensive disc classes. </font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">But \nthis is all a highend description and is more intersting if you are 65 and has a \nbunch of aa and raid every day. Its not the average exp group players everyday \nfights.</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">Dont \ntake this wrong, im jus ttrying to provide an insight into another world that I \nsuspect most on this list have never seen and have a hard time to \nimagine.</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div></div>\n  <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1833428505OutlookMessageHeader\" lang=\"en-us\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><font\n face=\"Tahoma\" size=\"2\">-----Original Message-----<br><b>From:</b> Nuada bobkins \n  [mailto:ikestarwolf@...] <br><b>Sent:</b> den 26 april 2003 \n  06:11<br><b>To:</b> EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br><b>Subject:</b> RE: \n  [EverQuest] Re: SK or Pali<br><br></font></div>\n  <div>\n  <div>\n  <p>Must have missed a few mails hehe, anyway it looks like a typical &quot;my class \n  is better argument&quot;.</p> \n  <p>What he means by DPS is Damage Per Second which is how Melees work out most \n  efficient weapon combo&#39;s.
