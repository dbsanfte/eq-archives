I have a couple<br/>\n&gt; characters (Mithe on Cathic-Thule and another druid there). Everytime I<br/>\n&gt; get to that character selection screen I debate, should I play my ranger<br/>\n&gt; or druid. If I play the druid I will greatly fall behind my friends that<br/>\n&gt; only play one character. To solve this I&#39;d love to see /who friends<br/>\n&gt; available from the character selection or server selection screen that<br/>\n&gt; way i could tell who was on and on which server. Say I click on<br/>\n&gt; Cathic-Thule and see my high level friends are not on I could decide to<br/>\n&gt; start a new character on PVP server etc...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me know what you think. If you agree petition or suggest this when<br/>\n&gt; online.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
