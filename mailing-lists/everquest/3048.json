The other classes are better if you \n  want to play mostly by yourself, explore, camp items, do quests, and just \n  generally have fun.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I am playing a paladin/magician duo right now and \n  they can really destroy what they are fighting, often as many as 4 blues at \n  once.&nbsp;The last classes I tried were enchanter, wizard and ranger and \n  those are all really weak.
