But, right now I havent been on for a while because \nI had to let my scribes go for the time being. I am planning to get back soon. I \nwant to get the two newiest expanesion. Lancy of Ysheka, and the lost dangunes. \nPlease forgive me I am a bad speller. But I like to keep up with it. I have a \nquestion where do you get EQ IM? And, does it cost anythign extra? Is there in \nthing great about those expanses? I know I have alot of questions. But, I \nremember that you guys are really helpful, and I am glad.
