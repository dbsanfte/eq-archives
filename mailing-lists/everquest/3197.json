Luckily I have a <br/>\nfriend that&#39;s a Druid so I got a port to the DL.  I tried to petition <br/>\nthe GM but it doesn&#39;t work if there isn&#39;t one on!<br/>\n<br/>\nKunark is a dangerous place for the good races.  The only place you <br/>\ncan bind a good melee is in FV and it&#39;s surrounded by mid-level <br/>\nmobs.  If you port over you end up in the DL, which is ok, it&#39;s just <br/>\ngetting out of there that&#39;s the problem!  The DL does have <br/>\nconnections to the FM and FV if you know where to look.  It&#39;s not a <br/>\nplace to be without a map!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I am also looking for a place to take me to the mid-40&#39;s.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen to the moon, Kunark, the Karanas and Velious.  I like to go to <br/>\nthe zones that have been abandoned, like all the dungones on <br/>\nAnatonica.  I&#39;m in the FM now and will probably be in the DL, like <br/>\neveryone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n37th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\nTeris-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
