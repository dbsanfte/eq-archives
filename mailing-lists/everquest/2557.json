One for<br/>\nthe rangers and one for the rogues.<br/>\nThere is also a quest in the warrior guild where you bring the guy a bat<br/>\nfur, a bonechip, a spiderline eye, and a ruined wolf pelt. He gives you a<br/>\nrandom item. sometimes armor or a gem that sells for a decent price. But you<br/>\nhave to have killed enough orcs to have good faction with him to do the<br/>\nquest. Hail him and he will give you the quest. I wish I could remember his<br/>\nname... he&#39;s in the place accross from the store that sells fletching stuff.<br/>\nPixies drop decent loot sometimes too. And there is the mail delivery quest<br/>\nfrom Felwithe to Kelethin. Sometimes the guy you deliver mail to gives you<br/>\nup to 5gp. I wish I could remember the name but my brain is just dead right<br/>\nnow.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Thanks so much Su...it just so happens that Amaiya<br/>\n&gt; (now on Fennin) was lucky enough to get two hatchets<br/>\n&gt; in her travels this weekend...This is great news and i<br/>\n&gt; will do as you have suggested...i have been hanging<br/>\n&gt; around the lifts but have now made lvl 5 (all by<br/>\n&gt; myself..WOOT)and will have to move on soon i think..no<br/>\n&gt; more safety of knowing the guards there...lol...Gosh i<br/>\n&gt; never knew i could have so much fun alone...is alot<br/>\n&gt; easier because i am not frustrating the BF who has<br/>\n&gt; been playing the game for a long time and cannot<br/>\n&gt; understand why i sometimes just &quot;don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; it&quot;...pffffffff...my thanks to all of you here who<br/>\n&gt; have been such a HUGE help...Anyone on Fennin???? :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **hugs**<br/>\n&gt; Amaiya, lvl 5 Wood Elf Druid, Loyal servant of Tunare </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
