But the problem with 2hb is that there are so many better<br/>\n&gt; weapons for the other weapons types that you rarely find a good 2hb to<br/>\nwork<br/>\n&gt; up your skill until the later levels.  I have 200+ skill in 1 and 2hs,<br/>\n1hb,<br/>\n&gt; and piercing but I&#39;ve never found a 2hb weapon that I could raise skill<br/>\n&gt; with.  Maybe I&#39;ll get lucky and win a roll on a Woodsman&#39;s staff one day<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; be able to use that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are good 2hb weapons......it&#39;s just that there are so many other<br/>\n&gt; better weapons that are easier to get.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I started practicing 2hb in my 20&#39;s with a Buryani Leg ripper I bought<br/>\nof a player for about 50pp... Fear kiting animals is a good way to get<br/>\nskill-ups with odd weapons, as it is fairly safe to do solo so you don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel a fool in front of other players with the amount of misses you get to<br/>\nbegin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I moved on to a Froglok Crusher, then a Drakkel Forged Sledgehammer<br/>\n(these can be bought off vendor for about 110pp if a player has sold one to<br/>\nthe vendor), and now a Drakkel Icegrinder. My 2hb is currently at 186 at<br/>\nlevel 47, and it would be maxed but I hardly used it  from 35 to 45 as I was<br/>\nleveling in a hurry in Dawnshroud.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my weapon skills at 47 are 1hs, 1hb, piercing all 200, 2hs 190, 2hb<br/>\n186. I expect to max both 2h before 50.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n<br/>\nHonig Wayfarer<br/>\n47 Ranger<br/>\nCazic Thule </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
