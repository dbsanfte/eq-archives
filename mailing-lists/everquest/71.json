Finding evidence of the death or whatever of a guards daughter last seen playing in the south pond. Killing the rat king and giving his head to one of the temple of thunder paladins. Delivering a letter to an undercover temple of thunder operative in the bloodsaber temple down there.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Haven&#39;t managed any of those. And the bloodsaber guards kill me as soon as i set foot in the door with 100+ dmg hits. So the undercover thing seems a little hard for me to do.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Jaybay</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
