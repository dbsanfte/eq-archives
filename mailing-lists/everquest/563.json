Well look no further, for I shall show you the way. Below is a<br/>\nbreak-down of the phases of smithing.<br/>\nBeginning Smithing (SKILL 1-27)<br/>\nThere are two ways to start smithing. One is to start from ground zero and<br/>\ngain all your skill naturally. This is certainly possible and you can do it<br/>\nby sharpening rusty daggers (place a sharpening stone and a rusty dagger in<br/>\nthe forge and click combine) and rusty shortswords until you hit 20 or so<br/>\nbut I suggest against it. Not only is it extremely tedious but its also<br/>\npretty wasteful of money and time. Finding that many daggers can be<br/>\nannoying. Instead I suggest gaining a few levels (4) and dumping 20 points<br/>\nin to Blacksmithing before you even sharpen your first weapon. 20 is the<br/>\nlimit that NPC trainers will train you to, so after that, you have to earn<br/>\nit the hard way. Once you hit skill 21, you will no longer gain any skill<br/>\nfrom sharpening cheap-o weapons. Instead you must get rusty weapons that you<br/>\ncan sell for more than 1gp and sharpen them only (longswords, spears, battle<br/>\naxes, etc) NOTE: You cannot sharpen hammers, staves or anything else without<br/>\nany &quot;sharp tips&quot; (maces are ok though) Keep sharpening these expensive rusty<br/>\nweapons until you hit approximate 27 skill. At that point these should stop<br/>\ngiving you skill increases and its time to REALLY spend some money.<br/>\n<br/>\nApprentice Smithing (SKILL 27-50)<br/>\nThis is massive boredom here. During this time period you will be making<br/>\nskewers. Skewers require one metal bit, one flask of water, and one skewer<br/>\nmold. NOTE: DO NOT USE SUMMONED WATER. Cost per skewer attempt is roughly<br/>\n2-3g each, so you can see if you are spending 40 plats the number of<br/>\nrepetitions you will go through. To make the metal bits you need to put two<br/>\nsmall pieces of ore and one flask of water in the forge and combine. Don&#39;t<br/>\nbe discouraged if you rarely succeed. I think I made maybe 10 or 11 skewers<br/>\nduring my whole journey to 40 smithing, if even that many, needless to say<br/>\nyou still gain skill. Just keep pouring in your money and improving your<br/>\nskill.<br/>\n<br/>\nJourneyman Smithing (SKILL 50-80)<br/>\nCongratulations! At skill 50 you can now make some easy banded mail items.<br/>\nStart by making Banded GORGETS. These take one gorget mold, one metal sheet,<br/>\nand one flask of water. Rough cost per attempt is about 1.2 platinum. These<br/>\nbanded gorgets can be sold to other players and thus your smithing training<br/>\nshould start to pay for itself. At 55, you can start making BRACERS and<br/>\nBOOTS. See the chart below for approximate skill needed to be successful at<br/>\nmaking banded items. This is not to say its impossible to make these items<br/>\nat lower skill levels, indeed you can make a helm with only 21 skill but<br/>\nyour chances are slim to say the least. My recommended skill levels produce<br/>\nsuccess around 20-30% of the time. This is sufficient for the items to pay<br/>\nfor themselves and provide extra money for increased learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster Smithing (SKILL 80+)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStart raking in the cash. As you get higher and higher you will notice<br/>\ncertain banded items no longer give you skill, eventually resulting in the<br/>\nneed to make mostly tunics, leggings, and cloaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMINIMUM SKILL CHART<br/>\n<br/>\nItem Name Skill Required Sheets: Needed:<br/>\nMetal bits  (10)<br/>\nFiles   (10)<br/>\nSteel Boning   (40)<br/>\nStuds   (40)<br/>\nGorgets  (50)   (1 sheet)<br/>\nBracers  (55)   (1 sheet)<br/>\nBoots   (55)  (1 sheet)<br/>\nMask   (60)  (2 sheets)<br/>\nSleeves  (60)  (2 sheets)<br/>\nHelm   (60)   (2 sheets)<br/>\nMantle   (80)  (2 sheets)<br/>\nBelt   (85)   (2 sheets)<br/>\nLeggings  (100)   (3 sheets)<br/>\nTunics   (100)  ( 3 sheets)<br/>\nCloaks   (145+)  ( 3 sheets)<br/>\n----------end paste----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nhope that helps =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 26, 1999 11:26 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Smithing info request<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Was wondering if someone would be so kind as to post/repost a complete<br/>\n&gt; listing of items you can create/make with blacksmithing, the approximate<br/>\n&gt; level they become trivial, the minimum skill level you&#39;d recommend before<br/>\n&gt; trying to create/make them, and the approximate resale value to other<br/>\n&gt; players.
