It took me 2 years to do this quest. I did some of the parts before it was made even more difficult. The part of finding the lost dwarf in Kael... That is a tough one.<br/>\nIt is a pretty good item though and I still wear it on my lvl 66 cleric.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-07-15, 12:30:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There is a great quest item with ext enhancement on it It is called <br/>\n&gt;the Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl it is a tradeskill quest however and <br/>\n&gt;takes some time to complete and has the effect of &quot;Zephyr of Brell&quot; <br/>\n&gt;which is 30 extension on your beneficial spells, as a bonus it also <br/>\n&gt;has FT 3 as well.
