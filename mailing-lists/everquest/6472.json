The rats there hit pretty hard, but<br/>\ndoable with Temp on at level 25.  Another place that I found, purely<br/>\nby accident, was the sarnak fort in the southwest part of Lake of Ill<br/>\nOmen.  There are two sarnak&#39;s at the gate, but once you break their<br/>\ncamp, you can single pull sarnak&#39;s out of there all day long.  Good<br/>\nxp, decent loot (not uber, but decent) and there is hardly ever anyone<br/>\nelse in the zone, so no competition.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Greg Burns &lt;freechylde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have an idea, and you may like it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is a little known zone, well its known but no body wants to go<br/>\nthere cause its abit out there. With the GOD expansion came a zone<br/>\ncalled &quot;Forgotten Halls&quot;. It is adjacent to Jaggedpine Forrest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Its an instanced zone, so you can solo there or go in with 5<br/>\nfriends. Go to the LDON camps and speak to the maguses there. Tell<br/>\nthem &quot;Nedaria&#39;s Landing&quot; and you will be ported there. ONce in<br/>\nNedaria&#39;s, go to the docks and find a High Elven Male on the docks, I<br/>\nforget his name, i think it starts with an &quot;E&quot;. Anyway, he is wearing<br/>\nsome kind of ornate tunic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do the dialog words and you will be given access, much like an LDON.<br/>\nIf you look at your compass, there will be a line marking your<br/>\ndirection. Follow the line and you will enter a cave, where you will<br/>\nsee some short chick, again her name escapes me. Do the dialog with<br/>\nher, and yo then have access. Click on the rock beside her and your in.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The nice thing about this zone, is at lower levels, nothing aggros<br/>\nyou. In here you  kill bats, rats, or &quot;earthen rejects&quot;.. There is a<br/>\nbat room, a rat room, and room with a mix of bats, rats, and earthen<br/>\nrejects. The rejects have a little more hp and hit a little harder,<br/>\nbut should be ok. WARNING... only attack bats, rats,or the earthen<br/>\nrejects. Attack anything else and the whole zone will unleash hell<br/>\nipon your head.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The zone respawns quite fast, so if you go in with a couple people<br/>\nyou will never run out of mobs to kill. It does get boring, but if you<br/>\nwant quiet effortless killing, go here. I took my SK here and in about<br/>\n3 hours, i managed to get her 2hs up from 20 to 100. Without a healer,<br/>\nit is tough, but was doable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The xp is quite good. If its just you, then the xp is close to what<br/>\nyou would pick up in PC. With others, percentage wise it drops, but<br/>\nagain, with the abundance of mobs, that shouldnt matter.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I took both of my clerics there and now their offensive and<br/>\ndefensive skills are maxed. Without the worry of aggro, its an awesome<br/>\nplace. I havent tried it, but with everything non-aggro there, one<br/>\ncould most likely fear kite in there. I.m not sure about quadding tho,<br/>\ndont have the cahoneys to try that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At around level 53 or so, stuff will start to aggro you, so unless<br/>\nyou have good crowd control, this zone is no longer good solo. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW, there is one way in and 2 ways out. 1) gate, or 2) speak to the<br/>\ndude at zone in, tell him you wish to leave...and he will put his foot<br/>\nto ur arse and zone you out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; rickcorriveau &lt;rickcorriveau@...&gt; wrote:    I have a lvl 25 shaman<br/>\nand I am trying to solo but wondering if I <br/>\n&gt;  just have it wrong.
