&nbsp;Ok, had to get that off my chest. \n  &nbsp;I hate when they do that. &nbsp; <br>And I tell them not to and they \n  still do it. &nbsp;Ok, with the looting. &nbsp; <br>Yesterday it was FFA and I \n  was trying to keep haste on tanks and everyone&#39;s <br>breeze going and tashan \n  and languid pace on mob and so there was a lot of <br>medding going on and I \n  wasn&#39;t getting loot. &nbsp;When I did loot I never got but <br>a few silver or \n  gold. &nbsp;The others were looting gems (which I could use ) and <br>tasarin \n  pages (which I really need) and was offering to buy. &nbsp;Well I meant to \n  <br>do a guild tell saying The bad thing about having to med in a group is I \n  miss <br>out on all the loot. &nbsp;Well guess what...I did a group tell. \n  &nbsp;Well then the <br>main tank started telling me to loot. &nbsp;She said \n  looting isn&#39;t going to take <br>away that much med time. &nbsp;And I also \n  started saying hey can I have that <br>Tasarins because no one else could use \n  them in the group but me. &nbsp;I like the <br>alpha loot 2 times no split. \n  &nbsp;I think it works good if people follow it. &nbsp;I <br>hate FFA! \n  <br><br>Lena <br><br><br>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;\"\n TYPE=\"CITE\">Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few \n    problems with <br>loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since \n    I play the main <br>healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up \n    to heal) I get <br>totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try \n    to establish alpha <br>loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the \n    casters. All they care <br>about is getting loot for themselves. These \n    people partake in <br>&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so \n    nobody else gets a <br>chance. And even when we establish a regular loot \n    order some people will <br>still loot out of turn. <br>And then we have \n    times when people say we roll for certain types of loot. <br>When I first \n    joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a \n    <br>ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he \n    <br>picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an \n    expensive <br>item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he \n    picked up a <br>bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, \n    &quot;no, that&#39;s only <br>for bronze armor&quot;... <br>Has anyone else had this \n    problem? <br>What do you think is the best and fairest loot order? <br>Just \n    wondering. <br>luv, <br>-Su <br>ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per \n    person) works pretty well when <br>people cooperate.</blockquote></font><font\n color=\"#000000\" face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\"\n FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\"></font></font></blockquote><br><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Arial\"\n size=\"2\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\"><br><br></font><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Arial\"\n size=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\"><b><i><br></i></b></font><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
