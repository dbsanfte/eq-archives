Anything specific you need to know about?<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. I<br/>\n&gt; am not a very good EQ<br/>\n&gt; player. I would consider myself ultra competent in<br/>\n&gt; group battles, but in<br/>\n&gt; other aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I<br/>\n&gt; have never gotten a<br/>\n&gt; character past level 40. My first character was an<br/>\n&gt; Erudite Enchanter by the<br/>\n&gt; name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to<br/>\n&gt; level 40 after two years or<br/>\n&gt; so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which was my<br/>\n&gt; friends character but I<br/>\n&gt; own it. I just started playing again after giving up<br/>\n&gt; on the game and playing<br/>\n&gt; DAOC. Eventually I gave up all MMORPGS deciding they<br/>\n&gt; were a waste of time.<br/>\n&gt; About a week ago, I decided to give EQ another<br/>\n&gt; chance and have decided that<br/>\n&gt; it has improved a great deal. I am now playing a<br/>\n&gt; Human Ranger who is level<br/>\n&gt; 30. I really like the character. His buffs and<br/>\n&gt; damage spells are great. I<br/>\n&gt; guess I could use some help on how to be a good EQ<br/>\n&gt; player. I have been<br/>\n&gt; playing for about two years and I feel like I know<br/>\n&gt; absolutely nothing about<br/>\n&gt; the game. I have never belonged to a good guild or<br/>\n&gt; anything. I play on the<br/>\n&gt; Xegony server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
