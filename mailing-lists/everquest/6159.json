I hope if by some scary chance EQ is around in 25 years, <br/>\nthat it would be very cool..more than it is now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see us wearing the &quot;VR Suit&quot; instead of using a keyboard. With it <br/>\nyou would feel it when an orc knocked you on your arse...and all <br/>\nmovements would respond, like (if my understanding is correct) they do <br/>\nwith digital animation for movies and such. You make a sword slashing <br/>\nmove, and your toon does....etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHell, if they&#39;d add that now, lol I&#39;d be there. I magine the workout <br/>\none would get after playing EQ...lol<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a moronic thought...Greg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds way to energetic for me!! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
