The Ti has a much faster redraw rate so graphics will<br/>\nlook cleaner and more detailed when you turn or move.  Also faster<br/>\nprocessing and memory so it cuts down on internal system lag.  A better<br/>\nvideo card can sometimes compensate for a slower system. Also, the Ti is<br/>\nmade from titanium which is much more heat resistant than previous cards.<br/>\nSo the card doesnt get as hot and there is less chance of failure later on.<br/>\nOverall it&#39;s a good card for the money.

I am picking up a GeForce4 TI 4200 64 mb<br/>\nvideo card and I was wondering how much of a difference that was from a<br/>\nGeForce4 MX440 04 mb video card.  Will I see much of a difference?  I was<br/>\njust wondering about that because I remember a while back a discussion about<br/>\nthe cards on this board before.  Well I would apperciate any comments on<br/>\nthis topic.  according to the manufacturer did say theis card did better<br/>\nthan thier 128 mb version of the same card due to the clock speed of the<br/>\nram.  Just what i have heard. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
