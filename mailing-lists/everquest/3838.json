I can see why","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-249549853\">I have not been playing EQ for years but I have played<br/>\nfor about 10 months and I feel I need to shed some<br/>\nfood for thought on this topic.......<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see why people suggest Stamina but I think it<br/>\ndepends on a few factors first.  If you are totally<br/>\nnew and don&#39;t know much about EQ NOR have a high level<br/>\nalt, I would Really have to say to put the extra in<br/>\nStr.  The reason is because Chainmail is still heavy<br/>\nand when have a full suit of Mail you will have about<br/>\n10-20 pts of weight to allow for loot.  This is not<br/>\nmuch at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOW, if you have an alt and are twinked, we all know<br/>\nwhat this means, then I can see why to put in Stamina.<br/>\n Since most will have a full suit of Ivory etched<br/>\narmow which does not weight all that much as compared<br/>\nto Chain.  Plus twinks will tend to CHAIN pull, like<br/>\nthe example we saw in the keep.  Meaning, pulling so<br/>\nmuch or the ranger being the main tank that you need<br/>\nto worry about Stamina.  If you have one or two<br/>\nwarriors, a ranger should not worry about STA since<br/>\nhis/her role is to assist and draw aggro if tank gets<br/>\nhurt to bad.  Also, Druids are so numerous that at<br/>\nafter level 25 they can cast Endure Fatigue which<br/>\nboosts your STA to full status.  So, if you are<br/>\ncareful in picking your groups, you should be ok with<br/>\nSTA.  The other thing that drains sta is a BIG TWINK<br/>\nweapon that is Heavy..  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSummary:  For a totally new player I still suggest STR<br/>\nand rely on others to assist in your flaws, like the<br/>\ndruid partner.  If you have alts and good weaps, then<br/>\nyes maybe STA is the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, make two rangers and play them til about<br/>\nlevel 20, which is not that hard once you get to know<br/>\nthe zones, then decide for yourself which char is<br/>\nbetter based upon your playing style...<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps but this is obviously open for debate,<br/>\nit really is a personal choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
