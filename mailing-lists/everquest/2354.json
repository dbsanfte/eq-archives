I created a Woodelf Ranger yesterday and planned to focus on this skill, but a friend has just told me that Archery is broken and serves no purpose but to pull albeit from great distances.  I was hoping that a well developed archer, along with snare could do most damage to mobs before its arrival.  If this not true I find it staggering.  Its fine for casters to snare, DD and DoT - ie fighting from a distance, but not bow-wielders?  <br/>\nAny advice and general observations would be kindly met<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nLegless, 8 Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\nAka Rykk Bloodfang,  52 Monk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
