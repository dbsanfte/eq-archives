I love it! Take everything good about eq, <br/>\nand you have daoc...there are a problem or 2, but thats to be expected....eq <br/>\nhad many more probs I hear ( I only started eq a year ago) so I am fully <br/>\npleased with my 40 bucks for the game (plus 35 for the memory card lol) its <br/>\nworth it to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m not cancelling eq...hubby still plays and I have some friends who <br/>\nwon&#39;t convert hehehe<br/>\n<br/>\nSynthea Firestorm<br/>\n40 Druidess<br/>\nSirens of the Storm - Drinal Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;wolffe&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wolffe@...\">wolffe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Camelot<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 23 Oct 2001 10:08:42 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been playing DAoC as well.  I think you&#39;re right in that they&#39;ve built <br/>\n&gt;on EQ and are better, much in the same way that EQ was better than UO when <br/>\n&gt;it came out.  I figure that we&#39;re all consumers and we play the best game.  <br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s nice to have the marketplace competition as each game tries to outdo <br/>\n&gt;the other.  There&#39;s nothing wrong or disloyal in switching RPGs, and there <br/>\n&gt;will be nothing wrong with switching back if/when EQ revamps itself.<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Keith J.

Dark Age has had the benefit of hindsight and learning from <br/>\n&gt;EQ&#39;s mistakes.  They have built upon them.  There is less downtime, more <br/>\n&gt;character specialization, less annoying corpse runs, better graphics, <br/>\n&gt;easier grouping, and better pvp.  DAoC is better than EQ currently, <br/>\n&gt;however, to EQ&#39;s credit -- Dark Age wouldn&#39;t be what it is if it hadn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;been for EQ&#39;s experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   If you like EQ, I think you&#39;ll like Dark Age if not as much, perhaps <br/>\n&gt;better.  The only drawback is that you need a pretty high-end system for <br/>\n&gt;smooth play (particularly a good graphics card).<br/>\n&gt;     -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;     From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LeSamLam@...\">LeSamLam@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LeSamLam@...\">LeSamLam@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;     Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 8:14 AM<br/>\n&gt;     To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;     Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Camelot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     My husband has been playing it.  In fact, after a few days, he <br/>\n&gt;cancelled his EQ account and is solely playing DAoC.  He keeps telling me <br/>\n&gt;to try it but I tell him I like EQ just fine.  From watching him, I can <br/>\n&gt;tell I don&#39;t wanna play.  BUT he&#39;s a hardcore gamer and EQ and Solitaire <br/>\n&gt;are the only games I play.
