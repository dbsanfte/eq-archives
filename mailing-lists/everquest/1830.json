Though, it&#39;s 5 levels within each <br/>\nohter in the beginning.  I forget when it starts to be 10 levels <br/>\napart.  Yes, you are right though.  This game is about fun not about <br/>\nwho gets to level 60 first.  That&#39;s what I asked myself with my <br/>\nfriends.  I always wondered why they always keep leveling instead of <br/>\ndoing other fun things.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m always behind my friends in <br/>\nlevels.  I&#39;m not always leveling.  I want to have fun.   I help <br/>\nlowbies (levels 10+) or newbies by healing them, buffing them, etc.  <br/>\nI just want to have fun by talking to others and maybe go trading.  I <br/>\nwill even maybe help my other friends who are lower level than me.  <br/>\nIf I don&#39;t do that, I probably will work on trading skills or skills <br/>\nI don&#39;t care about that still is fun such as fishing hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we&#39;ve all heard of the RP server when it first came out.  I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s almost been a month ever since it&#39;s gone live.  If it&#39;s <br/>\nwhat I think you&#39;re thinking of.  Sullon Zek right?  I think a lot of <br/>\npeople went over there because it sounded really cool. AND there&#39;s no <br/>\nsuch thing as &quot;play nice&quot;.  Training people is actually encouraged so <br/>\nyou better watch out when a train comes.  I like to roleplay <br/>\nsometimes but I&#39;m not a serious roleplaying player.  I like to <br/>\ncommunicate with everyone and be able to roleplay at the same time <br/>\nand also not roleplay whenever I want to.  So... I don&#39;t think that <br/>\nserver will fit me.  It&#39;s kinda cool for those who are serious <br/>\nroleplaying players though or that find it fun to try.  Oh yes, <br/>\nanother thing.  You don&#39;t have to share camps.  All camps are like a <br/>\ncontest so... that&#39;s another thing to watch out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Laura Buskirk&quot; &lt;wolffe@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like powerleveling much, either.  As I had stated in my <br/>\noriginal<br/>\n&gt; post, I just want to get the husband&#39;s char up a level or two so we <br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; travel together.  He&#39;s 10th and I&#39;m 16th.  I&#39;ve been playing for a <br/>\nwhile<br/>\n&gt; (though I had a long layover) and he&#39;s only been playing for a <br/>\nmonth or so.<br/>\n&gt; If I remember correctly, isn&#39;t the formula: level + (level/2) used <br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; determine who can group and still gain exp?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that I would ever want to be powerleveled, myself.  <br/>\nIt seems<br/>\n&gt; like a big pain in the neck to get all one&#39;s stats up to par.  I <br/>\ncan also<br/>\n&gt; honestly say that I really don&#39;t care if I ever get a character up <br/>\nto 60th<br/>\n&gt; lvl.  What&#39;s the point in reaching the end game as fast as you <br/>\ncan?  I say<br/>\n&gt; have fun along the way and roleplay like you would with paper and <br/>\ndice.<br/>\n&gt; Okay, maybe not speaking in an mock English accent to the computer <br/>\nscreen<br/>\n&gt; (at least not when anyone&#39;s looking), but still!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By the way, has anyone heard anything about the new roleplaying <br/>\nserver?  Has<br/>\n&gt; there been any word on when/if it will launch?  I&#39;d heard that they <br/>\nwere<br/>\n&gt; trying to work out the kinks to make sure that no one could <br/>\ncommunicate if<br/>\n&gt; they didn&#39;t speak the same language.  I can see that this would be <br/>\na problem<br/>\n&gt; if people used /emote to speak to each other, or even use their <br/>\ncharacter<br/>\n&gt; description.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How many people would leave their present servers and characters <br/>\nfor the RP<br/>\n&gt; server, I wonder?  I think I&#39;d give it a try.<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Dan [mailto:danspth@y...]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 29, 2001 7:31 AM[To: EverQuest@y...<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EverQuest] Re: Fighter armor and weapons at low level<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Opinions vary. I personally find the whole power leveling idea to <br/>\nbe most<br/>\n&gt; dishonorable. To see an orc camp taken over by a 50+ druid and a lv <br/>\n6 ogre<br/>\n&gt; warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer reminds me how people are <br/>\nhave no<br/>\n&gt; willingness to work for things (the whole cheat code thing). But <br/>\nmany people<br/>\n&gt; find it ok to twink/power level and, well, so be it. I can see it, <br/>\nshiver,<br/>\n&gt; and keep moving. Live and let live. I am fortunate that at lv 43 I <br/>\ncan solo<br/>\n&gt; and this is only an inconvience at worse to me instead of a real <br/>\nissue. But<br/>\n&gt; up until lv 35 I was still having camps stolen from me by uber <br/>\ntwinks and<br/>\n&gt; anon druids.<br/>\n&gt;     -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;     From: Thomas H.
