It&#39;s something funky with my mail I guess.&quot;</p>\n<p>aw, mail&#39;s messing up for me too.</p>\n<p>&quot;Anyway to answer your email David, I do understand where your coming from but for me that&#39;s the whole point. last night is a good example, I got over to Dagnor&#39;s and unfortunately went the wrong way and got killed, (several times), while trying to recover my body. I also was bound over in WF so that made the trip even more fun! One of my guildmates and a necro from another guild came to my aid but before this happened we spent the majority of the evening trying to get my corpse.&quot;</p>\n<p>:( Why did it take you so long to get your corpse?</p>\n<p>&quot;To answer the issue of getting invites, well I really don&#39;t have that much of a problem getting them. My Ranger is invited because of her skills in track and sence heading more than for her &quot;gear&quot;.&quot;</p>\n<p>:) you&#39;re lucky. I always hear that them and halflings are the butt of all jokes. and btw, how do you show them that you have high track and sense heading?</p>\n<p>&quot;My Gnome Warrior is invited alot by lower to mid level classes to help them with exp and funds. Mostly because I enjoy it and don&#39;t really care about my own personal gains.&quot;</p>\n<p>Gnome warrior? That must&nbsp;make some good roleplaying.</p>\n<p>&quot;My Mage is just coming up but he gets invited alot too mostly becuase he can take care of his own pretty well without his magic.&quot;</p>\n<p>ok, um, how&#39;s that possible?</p>\n<p>and gtg, i will finish this later.</p></blockquote><p><br><hr size=\"1\">Do you Yahoo!?<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">Faith Hill</a> - Exclusive Performances, Videos, & more<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">faith.yahoo.com</a> </p></span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
