But don&#39;t worry, <br/>\nit&#39;s not like you will go bankrupt. If they want a donation for locating <br/>\nyour corpse, just give what you can... it does not have to be expensive. I <br/>\nusually donate 5 plat. when I make donations, and I never expect donations <br/>\nwhen I buff, SOW, transport, ect. with my Druid. Some people might want <br/>\ndonations, some won&#39;t.
