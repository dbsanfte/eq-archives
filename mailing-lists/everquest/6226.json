Not sure.<br/>\nNot sure if it&#39;s still there but there was a guide on how to be annoying in Everquest on somethingawful.com.<br/>\nMy brother actually tried some of the ideas. He aggrod a bixie and then convinced some newbs that it was his friend in shapeshifted form and got them to try to invite it to group. He was like &quot;would you group with my friend please? He&#39;s not very big but he can punch pretty hard&quot;. He also did the same with some prisoners in Highkeep. Took them to the warrior room. Nobody believed him and started killing the prisoners. My bro was like &quot;NO! He&#39;s my friend!!&quot; When they looted the corpses he was like &quot;NOOO! Now he can&#39;t get a rez and he lost his level!!&quot;<br/>\nI&#39;ll have to look up more sites with EQ stuff.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-06-06, 16:45:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Where can somebody find more stuff like this, or more EQ-related humour sites?
