I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-396809246\">Actually, I have been PLed a little. I had people come up and offer to PL<br/>\nme. I learned what they were capable of and it helped to hone my grouping<br/>\nskills. I knew what I had to do as well as what they had to do. I learned my<br/>\nlimitations. I always try to suggest strategy to anyone I PL. Generally<br/>\nPLing is NOT good for a firsttime player. It&#39;s best for when you already<br/>\nhave a character that has leveled up well. Then you can just level up<br/>\nanother quickly. I don&#39;t really like it when people ask me to PL them.<br/>\nAlthough when I think about it, my mother has been PLed a bit and she is a<br/>\nhorrible player. She doesn&#39;t like grouping, doesn&#39;t like sharing loot,<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like sharing xp.. And she actually complains that she has to do some<br/>\nof the work to kill the mobs when I PL her... sheesh. Sorry, venting there.<br/>\nBut I got the thing down to less than a quarter of life, atoned it, and she<br/>\nwas like &quot;you didn&#39;t do enough dmg to it&quot;. But if I did more dmg I&#39;d kill<br/>\nit. Some people. Venting again.. sorry.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been playing for about two years and have never been powerleveled or<br/>\ngiven anything and I still have a ton to learn about the game. I don&#39;t see<br/>\nhow anyone could possibly be pl&#39;ed and be a good player.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: J.
