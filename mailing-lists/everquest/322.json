In fact, a couple of the higher level players in the chat room (both of them claimed to be 30+) came back with an absolute YES.  The thinking is that at lower levels (say 6-15), the level of MOB that would probably kill you is going to be higher than you.  At these levels, &quot;blues&quot; are not difficult to defeat.  At higher levels, MOBS than con blue to you (meaning lower level than you) are far more dangerous and can easily kill your character.  Even some &quot;greens&quot; are capable of defeating your character at high levels.  This may be part of the reason why people experience much greater experience loss at high levels and would also explain why some people lose more experience than others at certain levels (which has, so far, been attributed to race/class).  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tFor what it&#39;s worth, I have personally not seen any evidence that the above is true.  My main character is only a level 10 shaman, so I don&#39;t get killed by &quot;blues&quot; very often.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMunk<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 20, 1999 8:42 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Loosing exp when dying<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRE: [EverQuest] Loosing exp when dyingyou start losing exp at level 6<br/>\nthe amount you lose increases each level<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Whitmore, Lance <br/>\n  To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 10:19 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Loosing exp when dying<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is just a guess but i think its your level that is used to calculate.  It seems that the higher you are the more experience you lose.  You dont lose any until you reach lvl 5, after that it seems to increase with each lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lance <br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>] <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 10:13 AM <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Subject: [EverQuest] Loosing exp when dying <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  I saw someone write somewhere that the exp you loose depends on the monster that kills you.  Such as if you die from a monster that is many levels below you, you loose more exp.  Is this true?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Azboklin the enchanter <br/>\n<br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n  ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways! <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Are you?
