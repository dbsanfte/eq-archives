I went to login to check my email <br/>\n&gt;and apparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea <br/>\n&gt;why. Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with <br/>\n&gt;my brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not <br/>\n&gt;I want to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a <br/>\n&gt;higher price. I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me <br/>\n&gt;off that they pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an <br/>\n&gt;angry letter of complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  ARG.
