This zone is used on<br/>\n&gt; many severs as the common place to buy and sell via<br/>\n&gt; /auction channel.<br/>\n&gt; Besides the lag created by 100+ people in the zone<br/>\n&gt; yaking it up with all the<br/>\n&gt; shouts, auctions and price checks, you can miss a<br/>\n&gt; lot of text you need to<br/>\n&gt; see. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;ll be a lot better off in Riverdale. One word of<br/>\n&gt; advice though, try to<br/>\n&gt; print off a couple maps on the zones you are<br/>\n&gt; fighting and traveling in. This<br/>\n&gt; is a good site for maps here<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqmaps.com/maplist.php3\">http://www.eqmaps.com/maplist.php3</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqmaps.com/maplist.php3\">http://www.eqmaps.com/maplist.php3</a>&gt;  Also, do not<br/>\n&gt; wonder out into the<br/>\n&gt; Kithicor Forest. At 8 pm game time this zone turns<br/>\n&gt; into a zone of death,<br/>\n&gt; with many undead, wolfs and dark elf casters that<br/>\n&gt; can range to upper 50s. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, try to use the /friends feature. If someone<br/>\n&gt; seems to be helpful and<br/>\n&gt; knowledgeable, add the to your friends list. You can<br/>\n&gt; do this by typing<br/>\n&gt; /friend &lt;name&gt;. Many people are nice and can take<br/>\n&gt; the time to answer a<br/>\n&gt; question you might have. With you now hunting out of<br/>\n&gt; Riverdale as opposed to<br/>\n&gt; GFay, you&#39;ll run into a lot nicer people. I know<br/>\n&gt; when I head into GFay and<br/>\n&gt; get bombed with tells, people looking for free junk.<br/>\n&gt; I automatically go into<br/>\n&gt; ignore mode when I zone into GFay. I get a lot more<br/>\n&gt; satisfaction giving some<br/>\n&gt; amour or whatever to someone I see fighting and<br/>\n&gt; playing the game the way it<br/>\n&gt; is meant to, than giving ANYTHING to a beggar. And<br/>\n&gt; believe me, I give a lot<br/>\n&gt; of stuff away, nothing like the feeling of helping<br/>\n&gt; someone out!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sistily<br/>\n&gt; 60 Gnome Warlord<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \tFrom:\tRob LeBeau [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">rlebeau65@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \tSent:\tMonday, January 07, 2002 9:41 AM<br/>\n&gt; \tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \tSubject:\tRe: [EverQuest] Serious Everquest<br/>\n&gt; question, please<br/>\n&gt; help<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI have started another char in Rivale as a halfling<br/>\n&gt; \tand I am finding it a LOT easier.<br/>\n&gt; \tBetter land marks, a road that leads right back to<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; \tcity.

The zone<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; you&#39;re in is IMHO hard to learn since so few<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; landmarks, but many people<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; feel is the best starting zone.<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; Corpse decay:<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; for a nude body, it&#39;ll decay (vanish) in 5<br/>\n&gt; minutes.<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; for a low level char (think below 20?) body with<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; items will decay in 30<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; minutes of online time(i.e. if logged in to<br/>\n&gt; game),<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; or 24 hours if not<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; logged in (EQ not running on your machine)<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; for a high level char (20+) body with items will<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; decay in something like<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; 24 hours online, or 1 week offline.<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; note that &#39;online&#39; includes time logged in as<br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; chars, and reportadly<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; even if in chat server.<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; There have been rumors that after corpse decay<br/>\n&gt; items<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; stick around slightly<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; longer(and could be picked up by anyone) but I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; never heard of this<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; actually happening, and I&#39;ve seen many a corpse<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; decay, so I don&#39;t belive<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; it&#39;s true.<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t__________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; \tDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; \tSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
