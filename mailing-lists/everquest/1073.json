There are plenty of other zones to work in you just have to know which ones. It is good that you want to work your way to Highpass but furst you need to get lvls Misty is good till lvl 7 maybe. Once there go to east commons and you can get orc groups, pumas, rattlesnake, asp, ruins groups also form there too. all you have to do is travel it is scary at first in unknown zones. I still get scared going to zones cause alot of stuff could still kill me easily. But once you get used to traveling the zones it is less scary and alot faster since you can take short cuts and stuff. Highpass hold is lvl 18+ so just get up in East commons till about ten then go to West Commons, North Ro, **Oasis** (real good exp groups). and work your way through there and once you get high enough go on to Highpass and get yourself a group.

Mine is only \n<div></div>&gt;a level 6 halfling warrior, but I have invested quite a bit of time \n<div></div>&gt;in just getting this far. I know I can build another character a bit \n<div></div>&gt;faster based on what I have learned, but is that investment of time \n<div></div>&gt;worthwhile? \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;I do have a second character just started, but that was only \n<div></div>&gt;something to play when the area my halfling was camped in was shut \n<div></div>&gt;down for repairs. I am thinking more on building a second character \n<div></div>&gt;for tactical purposes. \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;For example, I wandered out of Rivervale to High Hold Pass one day, \n<div></div>&gt;and was slaughtered by Orcs. I managed to sneak back to recover my \n<div></div>&gt;stuff, but could not get out fast enough. I gave up that corpse, and \n<div></div>&gt;concentrated on building in Misty Thicket. \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;My thought is to build a character over time just to get through High \n<div></div>&gt;Pass Hold. My greater interest is in the warrior working his way \n<div></div>&gt;across Misty Thicket. Am I wasting valuable game time on this second \n<div></div>&gt;character? High Pass Hold seems extremely difficult, and might not be \n<div></div>&gt;worth the effort until much later in the game. \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;Any thoughts? \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;Samwiseguy \n<div></div>&gt; \n </span></blockquote><div></div><br clear=\"all\"><hr>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
