Sometimes you group with the only people available though. Like in\n<br>Highpass if you need in a group you&#39;re stuck with the people camping the\n<br>room you want to camp.\n<br>I&#39;ve had mostly good experiences with looting but there are a few people\n<br>who&#39;ve given me trouble. One thing that pissed me off-- I was group leader\n<br>and had alpha loot established. My computer crashed. When i logged back in\n<br>there was a new group leader. Despite the fact that I had been at the spawn\n<br>point first and had established the group, he felt that bc he had reinvited\n<br>people that he was now in charge. He said it was FFA -- ninja loot.\n<br>When I asked them to allow me to loot just once corpse he told me I could if\n<br>I was fast enough. Often while I was busy healing him he&#39;d go loot\n<br>something. When it was clear he didn&#39;t appreciate my help, I left. I mean, I\n<br>need money to buy spells and stuff.\n<br>luv,\n<br>-Su</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\"><b><i>\n<br></i></b></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
