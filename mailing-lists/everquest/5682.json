It is for<br/>\n&gt; the Initiate of Tunare neckpiece, that will eventually<br/>\n&gt; lead me to getting a neck piece that has a mana free<br/>\n&gt; root effect.  I am having problems getting the<br/>\n&gt; Rancerous Ghouls to spawn in Lesser Faydark.  I have<br/>\n&gt; done all day (real time) camps running around killing<br/>\n&gt; undead, and tracking, but can&#39;t seem to get them to<br/>\n&gt; spawn.  Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Iaeerwen Feywarder<br/>\n&gt; Druid of the 20th Season.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure that they spawn anymore... I think they were only there<br/>\nfore a couple of weeks for a special &#39;event&#39; a couple of years ago, and<br/>\nthe quest involving them dates to that event too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be wrong, but I don&#39;t think that quest works anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonig Wayfarer<br/>\n65 Ranger<br/>\nCazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.644 / Virus Database: 412 - Release Date: 01/04/2004 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
