Now this is <br/>\na choice that I made which seemed to &quot;fit&quot; my toon and her personality. <br/>\nI also have a Warrior who just uses a 2hs weapon. I plan on building up <br/>\nhis skills in the other areas too but a 2hs seems to &quot;fit&quot; him the best. <br/>\nIt&#39;s all about how you want to play YOUR toon, there is no right or <br/>\nwrong way. One thing you may want to consider is that some weapons carry <br/>\nsome cool abilities. such as a damage bonus or spell. This may be <br/>\nsomething you might want to keep in mind and also in some situations you <br/>\ncan benefit from these added bonuses. You asked a very good question, a <br/>\nbasic one and really IMHO is something that alot of players really don&#39;t <br/>\nthink about. They are more interested in getting the uber twink gear <br/>\nwhich is nice but if you can&#39;t use it to it&#39;s full potential and to your <br/>\nadvantage, it&#39;s really not that uber.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\nDurgaa<br/>\nRanger of the 34th season. (And still learning everyday!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
