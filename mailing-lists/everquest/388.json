The<br/>\nTnT2 also will support 32-bit textures - which will make a HUGE difference<br/>\nthat the 16-bit hardware that the Voodoo3 (22-bit in software but that will<br/>\ncause another performance hit)  Note that the 2000 is easily overclockable<br/>\n(but you&#39;ll need to add a fan).  Note that as far as I know - there&#39;s not a<br/>\nsingle game out there now that supports above 16-bit textures so TODAY this<br/>\nisn&#39;t an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn-the-other-hand:<br/>\nThe 2000 cost me $129 at Best Buy - the TnT2 Ultra will cost AT LEAST $100<br/>\nmore than that (possibly more - I haven&#39;t been pricing them)<br/>\nIf you are on a budget this is huge.  Also keep in mind - if you are ONLY<br/>\nplaying Everquest - I&#39;ve seen TONS of posts from people having problems with<br/>\nthe V770. Sounds like Diamond (Nvidia?) need to fix the driver for EQ.  My<br/>\n2000 has behaved flawlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - the Matrox G400 is out now as well a buddy of mine claims it smokes<br/>\nthe TnT2 - but I haven&#39;t done research to verify this.  If you  can afford<br/>\n$250 list for a V770 Ultra or a Matrox G400 AND plan on playing games other<br/>\nthan EQ consider forgoing the V3 2000<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion - the 2000 is the best performer for the price (also - I am<br/>\nrunning a 300 MHz machine so I won&#39;t see a speed difference with the faster<br/>\ncards anyway).  But given Trevor&#39;s concern - save that receipt, packing<br/>\nmaterials, etc in case you have to return a defective card.  I haven&#39;t had<br/>\nANY probs with the 2000 and am REALLY satisfied with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) SOME I repeat SOME people how are on @Home cable modem service have<br/>\nseverely high Packet Loss problems with Everquest.  MANY people on the same<br/>\ncompany have no problems at all.  If you are considering @home  I would<br/>\nrecommend posting on alt.games.Everquest and the www.eqvault.com Tech<br/>\nwebboard asking for people in your exact area if they have problems.  If<br/>\nyour cable is a different company I would sign up for cable as fast as you<br/>\npossibly can!<br/>\n<br/>\nDanny Sniderman<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Trevor Gray &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xenogear@...\">xenogear@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 01, 1999 12:59 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Voodoo3 2000, System, Cable Modem<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Trevor Gray&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xenogear@...\">xenogear@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; DONT get the Voodoo 3 anything go for a Nvidia Ultra Tnt2.
