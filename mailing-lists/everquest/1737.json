Hulse] I just found it extremely annoying. I was mostly just<br/>\nworking on leveling and the money aspect wasn&#39;t of too much concern but<br/>\nwhat about all the newbies. Man that would really tick me off if I was<br/>\nnew and trying to earn some cash and some ass comes up and steals my<br/>\nloot. <br/>\n[Steven R. Hulse] For example, the other night I was with a group at Orc<br/>\nHill and accidently stole another player&#39;s kill. (Carnage everywhere,<br/>\ngot confused), My whole intention was to help her out since she was a<br/>\nlower lvl character and getting her butt kicked by 3 Orcs Luckily she<br/>\nshouted out and I realized what happened and made it up to her. I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t mind the stealing if it was accidental and then they realized<br/>\nand apologized, heck I probably would ask them to team up, All I want to<br/>\ndo now is lvl my characters. But blatently follow and steal is just<br/>\nannoying. I&#39;ve noticed that a few newbies are the main ones. Yes I can<br/>\nunderstand if youÂ’re a Gnome and go over to Greater Fey to lvl at Orc<br/>\nhill or to buy stuff and don&#39;t want to get killed but hey there are<br/>\nthose of us that would love to team up with newbies to help them out. <br/>\n<br/>\nC-ya!<br/>\nSteve</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
