Just wanted to<br/>\nsee how you all are doing, been a long time and I haven&#39;t seen any of<br/>\nyour or your brothers toons online recently.   I responded to your<br/>\ningame email too btw =)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust checking to see what you guys are doing, what games you are playing<br/>\nand what your future plans are for EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been jumping around a lot.  You know I was playing SWG but<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been back there in quite a while.  Was very excited about EQ2<br/>\nbut although it&#39;s a simply georgous game, having a hard time getting<br/>\n&quot;into&quot; it.... Not as fun as I expected it to be.   Have tried WoW and<br/>\nthat&#39;s pretty fun even if the graphics aren&#39;t my style...  But getting<br/>\ntired of that too....  My real life bro has been begging me to try City<br/>\nof Heros and to tell you the truth, have only been playing a few weeks,<br/>\nbut that has been a lot of fun, but we will see if it lasts, it does<br/>\nseem kinda limited...  I even picked up Matrix Online LOL... And it<br/>\nseems a lot like city of heros with better graphics and that cyberpunk<br/>\nworld, kinda fun, we&#39;ll see... Sounds like the story will be furthered<br/>\nwithin the game somehow and I&#39;m weird, but I loved all the movies and so<br/>\nI&#39;m curious about the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, having said all that, I still find myself coming back to EQ ... As<br/>\nfar as I can tell, no game has it&#39;s depth or social system and although<br/>\nit&#39;s getting old and a bit tired, it is still &quot;home&quot; of sorts and I<br/>\nalways love coming back. Hahahaha, <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond here on privately!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nScott ( Nortic, Paria, etc... ) <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 10, 2005 1:41 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] how come<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPicture attachments are not allowed in this group as it causes some<br/>\npeople&#39;s email clients to crash.<br/>\nI have to check to see if the thing is set to allow people to upload<br/>\npictures.
