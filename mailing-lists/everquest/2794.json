I have thought about it a \n  bit. We <br>pay less than $200 a year just to play. Not bad. I spent at least \n  <br>$500 on GamesWorkshop products each year when I was more active <br>there. \n  <br><br>I don&#39;t have a problem dropping the monthly fee. It is quite \n  <br>reasonable. I might be able to dump another $500 a year into <br>upgrades. \n  Unfortunately, my machine is now pretty much maxed. So I <br>must hope that I \n  can hold out at the present level long enough to get <br>together the funds \n  for a more upgradeable tower.<br><br>How much are others willing to pay to \n  play?<br><br>Barto Proudfoot <br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
