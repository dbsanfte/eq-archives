There was a time <br/>\nwhen our highest level Cleric at the time was so <br/>\ninundated with requests from  guildies to rez them <br/>\neverytime they died.  It didn&#39;t matter that  there was a <br/>\ncleric in the zone that was happy to do the rez, for a <br/>\nsmall donation in most cases.  But the people that <br/>\neither had not been smart enough to carry enough pp on <br/>\nthem or were just too cheap to donate for the rez were <br/>\nmostly the ones to beg our cleric to rezz them.  Now our <br/>\ncleric soon realized the pattern only after I had the  <br/>\ngumption to mention it to him after I got a rezz from <br/>\nhim, luckily he was only one zone over from where I had <br/>\ndied and he was getting ready to log for the night so I <br/>\nmanaged to catch him when he wasn&#39;t busy.  Once I showed <br/>\nhim the pattern he learned to not drop everything he was <br/>\ndoing to rezz the poor soul and also checked to see if <br/>\nthere was a cleric nearby before he even went to rezz <br/>\nthe peep.  Unfortunately he got  one request too many <br/>\nwhen he was working on his Epic and he got fed up and <br/>\nleft guild.  But the few of us who didn&#39;t bother him <br/>\nconstantly if he was not busy he will still do teh rez <br/>\nfor  us IF and only If we were not able to find one on <br/>\nour own.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the rezzes really are  more of a priviledge than a <br/>\nright in the game. At least that is the way I see it.  I <br/>\npretty much solo a lot onmy own atm when i am really not <br/>\nwanting to hurry up and level.  this helps me learn the <br/>\nzone I am in a little better and  I rarely ask for a <br/>\nrezz unless I have lost a level or I am very close to <br/>\nding.  And if I must go to the guild for a rezz i make <br/>\nsure I have exhausted all the other avenues before going <br/>\nto teh guild to see if any of our rezzers are on.  Hell <br/>\nI&#39;ve even settled for a 35% on more occasion than I can <br/>\ncount  if that was the best i could get and was quite <br/>\nhappy with it. And i always make sure that I offer a <br/>\ndonation whether I have said I would donate or not.  <br/>\nMost times when I do get teh rezz I have had the <br/>\ndonation rejected only because I made the effort to fork <br/>\nover the pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nCynfyn MacCulloch 51 DESK<br/>\nHalyburton Bearhugger 26 BarbShm<br/>\nSaltaque 12 HIEEnch<br/>\nQapmoc 11 HalfElf Ranger<br/>\nOroblram 9 Hu War<br/>\nDoktari 6 HIE Cleric<br/>\nDefender of the Faith<br/>\nSaryn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings toward game <br/>\n&gt; death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s attitudes <br/>\n&gt; toward game death?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on <br/>\n&gt; since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in <br/>\n&gt; awkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t just <br/>\n&gt; call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor do  <br/>\n&gt; have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big <br/>\n&gt; nasty.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the <br/>\n&gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all <br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server. He <br/>\n&gt; is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and tactics <br/>\n&gt; and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the <br/>\n&gt; Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but enjoy <br/>\n&gt; my independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career as <br/>\n&gt; possible. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
