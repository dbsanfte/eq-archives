It included <br/>\nwhere to get Ry&#39; Gorr armor and stuff like that.<br/>\nAlso, please don&#39;t waste space in here by telling everybody how <br/>\nworthless these guides are.  If you have one post it as a document in <br/>\nthe files section, and let everybody decide for themselves how useful <br/>\nor worthless the guides are.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
