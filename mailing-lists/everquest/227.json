The vast majority of us<br/>\n&gt; have extremely similar connection speed between 28800 and 50000 - I would<br/>\n&gt; guess most have V.90 running just under 50000.  While of course upstream<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; 31200 for V.90 - it&#39;s safe to assume the data transfer on &quot;zoning&quot; would<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; primarily downstream.  I have heard that people running on fat pipes get<br/>\n&gt; good zone times - so clearly this IS an important issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However - those of us without those fat pipes (again the vast majority of<br/>\n&gt; us) notice HUGE discrepancies in zoning times based on speed of the<br/>\nmachine.<br/>\n&gt; Ever have a party member running on a 166 machine?  So clearly - there is<br/>\n&gt; also something processor intensive going on here in addition to the<br/>\n&gt; data-transfer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m guessing that there is some sort of code building complex data<br/>\n&gt; structures from the data it is getting from the net.  This would lead me<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; believe that with enough memory - there could be something done in code to<br/>\n&gt; store multiple zones in memory...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But of course - only the people with access to the code could answer that<br/>\n&gt; question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To be honest - I&#39;d be thrilled with a very simple change Verant could put<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; with a few lines of code:  get rid of that bloody license agreement that I<br/>\n&gt; have to click accept on EVERY single time I load the game...  Put a switch<br/>\n&gt; in an INI file or something!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde Bard of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael_Wyatt@...\">Michael_Wyatt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 05, 1999 6:44 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] What&#39;s missing in Everquest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael_Wyatt@...\">Michael_Wyatt@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One point - with the zone loading it is not at all a question of *your*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loading the zone into memory - if you watch your HD while zoning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you will notice that it only spends a fraction of that time on actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loading things - the rest is network traffic. This is because the zones<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on each server are split up among many different computers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From what I can see, when you zone, the game logs you off the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; current zone server and then logs you into the new zone server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; automatically. This is why sometimes you get kicked back to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; login screen when you are zoning ( the login to the new zone server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time outs ) .<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It would be nice if it could transfer you straight into the zone if it<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on the same zone server, but the way it is setup allows for load<br/>\n&gt; &gt; balancing and such which is good ( but damn the wait is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; frustrating 8) )<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt; on 06/05/99 09:01:26<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:everquest@onelist.com\">everquest@onelist.com</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqss@...\">eqss@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; cc:    (bcc: Michael Wyatt/AU/AMP)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject:  [EverQuest] What&#39;s missing in Everquest?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Everquest is best thing what i see in online gaming, from graphic to<br/>\nsound<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and grup sistem but it still miss much things wich leaves too much place<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; concurent products to enter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; First it is hard to add new zones or monsters it request huge uploads (<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this can be corrected with addon discs but it is another question),<br/>\n&gt; loading<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of zones is realy messed up if you just exit one zone it takes soooo<br/>\nlong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to reload it again it will be nice to have 2 zones in memory if you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough memory for this (i have 128 mb).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is concentrated on gruping but too hard for solo play for some<br/>\nclasses<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and i dont like to play necromancer or any pet holder, and gruping have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much flows wich need corection and additional balancing like higer lv<br/>\n&gt; mages<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and wizards.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also there are too low gains from questing and one thing wich can add<br/>\nmuch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to game can be a god questing sistem where many diferent players must<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cooperate to reach some target but for now it is only killing stronger<br/>\nMOB<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and if you spend 5 hours to resolve quest and in end you dont know a<br/>\nright<br/>\n&gt; &gt; word wich you hear on other side of continent you make all way back<br/>\nwrite<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right word on paper go back and say it only to get 1 rusty sword and 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; copper as a 12 lv caracter not to see any move on your experience bar it<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; realy bad. i do it 3 times to 3 diferent quests and as i try hardest<br/>\n&gt; things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what i found and after this reward i lost wish to try again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be thrue it will be nice to get experience also for trading skills<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give them more variants so a posibility to make all normal armours and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapons. And it will be nice to have possibility to make a dragon<br/>\nleather<br/>\n&gt; &gt; armour ( hint hint)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It will be nice to have some chests wich thiefs can picklock.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Fishing some other things then normal fishs, or other stramge things<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boots with a gen in bag with a surprise big fish wich will pull you in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; water and cast summon pirana swarm on you eheheeh<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It will be nice to have a place where you can leave your goods to sell<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where you must pass evry now and then to collect all income or it is<br/>\nlost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; put this place on some lost plane or limit sellers to some level range,<br/>\ni<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wish to buy a totem stah and all mana gain equipment but as im from<br/>\neurope<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and i play normaly when all servers are empty i cannot buy or sell<br/>\nnearly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything. and i play on fenin ro wich is all time full. ( hmm maybe i<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; move from rathe mountains not too much people know where this place is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eheheheh)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It is great and wonderfull world but for now it is a little bit empty it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; needs a soul, a movement a random orc attacks on kelethim, dark elf<br/>\n&gt; rampage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on freeport, dragon flying in sky in unknown direction, strange never<br/>\nseen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beast in dark wood to start legends. More inteligence in program to make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; world looks more diferent so that finaly a camping is not more<br/>\n&gt; interesting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It is not need for human intervence it can be done by program if you<br/>\nleave<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a orc camp and in zone is many players then why not that orcs group and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start hunting around geting items from falen (eheheh at last some money<br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bank will get some real signifikance). Other similar products will come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; soon big bad MS is preparing to enter in game on big door ( i just read<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; news on its site it will bring some interesting news) the other players<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also on front door for bringing something new soon everquest will not be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only game in 3d rpg town and if a game is not interesting enough when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others come in play ? .... ?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; P.S. I like this game very very much and all this critics are only in<br/>\nhope<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that it will give some ideas how to make it better and that i will be<br/>\n&gt; shure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to play it long long time as i enjoy it now.
