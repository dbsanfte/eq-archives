mages are very strong<br/>\nsolo chars, but can also be a valuable addition to a group. what a mage<br/>\nmust know is, when to use which pet, if to use a pet at all. the dmg spells<br/>\na mage has aren&#39;t too bad either.<br/>\n<br/>\nactually i can&#39;t give you good advice where to go at your level, because<br/>\nif i start a new char now, i powerlevel them to 20 with the help of quests<br/>\nor my other chars (quest 1 to 10, druid 10 to 15, cleric 16 to 20). imho<br/>\nthe game really starts to make fun after you are 20, because you have<br/>\nquite some gear (for melees) or spells (for casters) at those levels and you<br/>\ncan start to play and not only try to survive... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nbut the above method is only good if you have played EQ for some time.<br/>\n<br/>\ni would recommend, have a look at sites like allakhazam to see what<br/>\nzones are availible for your level range and try to explore them. if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like the zone, just don&#39;t try to stay there only because other say<br/>\nit &quot;sooo cooool&quot; there; this is especially true, if someone of another<br/>\nclass recommends you a zone! for example: i could hunt with my<br/>\nnecro at the same place as with my druid, but when i got there with<br/>\nmy necro, she was 10 levels below the level of my druid! also some<br/>\nspots are more suitable for soloing or grouping, but this also depends<br/>\non the level: some groups can get good exp in group at level 45 where<br/>\nsome solo at 55+ (and those 55+ also get good exp).<br/>\n<br/>\nanother factor one should take care of: are there any faction hits!?!?<br/>\nmany don&#39;t care too much about old world zones now, because the<br/>\nnewer zones are much more friendly to the different races and offer<br/>\nquite some different faction relations. but this also has to do with your<br/>\nlevel, and what expansion you can play in.<br/>\n<br/>\nok, it is time to stop now... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck<br/>\n  - bilt<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik, lvl 57 gnome magician, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
