Just foraged vegetables and \n  purchased <br>water. No containers, just water to buy. Everytime I have a load \n  of <br>veggies I stop and brew some. Still don&#39;t know what vegetable oil is \n  <br>for.<br><br>For smithing the best advance with little cost is metal bits. \n  When <br>metal bits no longer gains advance, make toolboxes. Use the tool \n  <br>boxes as bank containers.When toolboxes no longer advance, make \n  <br>skewers. This seems to be the lowest cost and least involved product \n  <br>to get you up to lvl 85.<br><br>At lvl 85 you can begin cranking out \n  banded armor with reasonable <br>success. Haven&#39;t yet looked past \n  that.<br><br>Baking is easy to advance if you forage. Fish rolls. Hunt a stack \n  of <br>bat wings, fish a mess of fish. Combine in oven, one and one. The \n  <br>level to trivial is around 100. <br><br>I am based in Rivervale, so I can \n  do all of this mostly in that zone. <br>Have to pop over o misty for the \n  batwings.<br><br>Haven&#39;t found a quick and easy way to advance pottery, yet. \n  Tailoring <br>has been my primary skill, advancing with my main experience as \n  I <br>made my own armor.
