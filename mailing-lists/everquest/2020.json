EQ does not still support low end.<br/>\nI&#39;m worried that they will someday upgrade beyond my range of being able to<br/>\nafford new hardware. My finances are about to take a hit.<br/>\nMy dad is getting me new RAM. He has the same computer.<br/>\nAnd I was gonna get a friend of mine to start playing EQ but now his system<br/>\nwon&#39;t be able to handle it.<br/>\nI just wish things weren&#39;t such a hassle.<br/>\nBut it could be worse.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Theres a difference between low end and a door stop.  EQ still supports<br/>\n </span></blockquote>low<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; end.  It&#39;s the obsolete systems that were still able to play before that<br/>\n&gt; have been left in the cold.  Don&#39;t worry they will find a way to play.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Make<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sure ya buy the right memory, if ya need help let us know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Memory and other equip.. www.googlegear.com nice, cheap, honest, reliable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, December 14, 2001 2:46 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] I hate Shadows of Luclin and I don&#39;t even own it<br/>\n&gt; yet...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, and maybe $265 isn&#39;t that much for you.

I know people who had to get their comps on a rent-to-own<br/>\n&gt; basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s easy to say they<br/>\n&gt; should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an escape for them.

I just wish there was a way Verant<br/>\n&gt; could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so financially<br/>\n&gt; stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if nothing else. Btw,<br/>\n&gt; someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap? Where was that again? I<br/>\n&gt; just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of RAM with it&#39;s motherboard<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; chipset. luv, -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not cost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; $265 after tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chip is a AMD Athlon 950.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
