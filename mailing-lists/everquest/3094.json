My wife and I had our Ogres get married almost 3 \nyears ago...it was less common then. We had GMs,guides,etc... all there. Since \nthen we have been to lots of weddings. Sometimes between people that know each \nother in r/l other times only in game. </font></strong></div>\n<div><strong><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\">You don&#39;t have to have to \nnotify a GM before hand but if you want something special you should....after \nthe wedding you can petition to change last names so they are they same. The \nmarriage means what the couple want it to.</font></strong></div>\n<div><strong><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"2\"></font></strong>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"ikestarwolf@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ikestarwolf@...\">Nuada \n  Armat&#39;gh</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Thursday, June 20, 2002 6:56 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Good duo for \n  dungeon play?</div>\n  <div><br></div>\n  <div>\n  <div>\n  <p><br><br></p>\n  <div>\n  <p>I recently met a couple of ppl who were getting married in-game, im curious \n  as to what this means, what the implications are game-wise etc.</p></div>\n  <p>does anyone know where thier is any information on this part of the \n  roleplaying thing?, i tried a search on google, boy that was a \n  misstake-nothing but ppl whining cos there marriage&#39;s broke up:( . anyway if \n  anyone can provide any information at all regarding in-game \n  marriages.</p></div>\n  <p>Thanks</p>\n  <div></div>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <div></div></div><br clear=\"all\">\n  <hr>\n  Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://g.msn.com/1HM505301/43\">http://explorer.msn.com</a>.<br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
