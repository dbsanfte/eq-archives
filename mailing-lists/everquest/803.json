I get inspected constantly by lowbies<br/>\n&gt; and I inspect/am inspected by people my level all the time.  It in no way<br/>\n&gt; bothers me, and if it does, it just shows you&#39;re getting into the game a<br/>\n&gt; little too much.  The only time this should ever make you feel uneasy is<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re on a PvP server because they&#39;re scoping for your items to see if<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; should kill you usually.  If this honestly bothers you, I would imagine<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; the type of person who is claustrophobic or who gets upset if someone<br/>\nbumps<br/>\n&gt; into you in the subway or something along those lines.  Eventually, you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; take it with an air of pride must likely, because it&#39;s usually just<br/>\nnewbies<br/>\n&gt; gawking over your equipment. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
