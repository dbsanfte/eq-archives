I am lvl 70 in tailoring, and<br/>\n&gt; working toward making Halfling tailored and imbued armor. I am a<br/>\n&gt; level 29 halfling druid, able so far to brew and smith the various<br/>\n&gt; parts I have needed to make my reinforced leather armor. I am soon to<br/>\n&gt; be off to Kunark to obtain my brute hides. Anyone been a brute<br/>\n&gt; hunter, who can give me any advice?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. Make sure you have camo memmed. FM is very very nasty. The brutes con<br/>\nblue to my lvl 35 cleric. And they hit fairly hard. The main problem with<br/>\nhunting them is the possibility of ads. So you will need to harmony.<br/>\nSnare would be helpful. kiting would be dangerous in FM bc of ads.<br/>\nEspecially the larger ones. I suggest that if you enter FM from LoIO you go<br/>\nleft rather than right to hunt. over to the right are goblin casters. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t see goblins casters much over to the left.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; What minimum level shall I need to succeed in brute hunting? And what<br/>\n&gt; sources for the high quality ore? I am not a good dungeon fighter,<br/>\n&gt; especially solo. Runnyeye is a bit much without a good group, and so<br/>\n&gt; far I have not found good groups for that fun place. Any suggestions<br/>\n&gt; for the getting of the required ore? Any other places it drops?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>High quality ore drops off of pickclaw warriors and raiders in<br/>\nHighpass/Highkeep (I can never keep it straight which is called which). You<br/>\nwould need a group at your level. Since you are a druid, people would really<br/>\nwant you in group there. Sow can be cast. And if you have regen and other<br/>\nbeneficial spells they will love you. Especially since you can heal. If you<br/>\nhave coin to spend, go to highkeep and auction to buy high quality ore.<br/>\nThere are usually some players who will part with it. I think the small<br/>\nbricks go for around 5pp and the large bricks around 10pp.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do the metal pieces used in the halfling armor have to also be made<br/>\n&gt; of hq ore, or just the sewing kit? The sites I have visited are not<br/>\n&gt; all that clear on that one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know on that one.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good hunting, everyone!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You too!<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
