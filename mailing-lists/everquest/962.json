Our purpose will be to enjoy this game for all it&#39;s worth -- to help each other, to teach those new to Norrath the skills they will need to survive. Rules will be simple -- things such as never beg, never ks, and always help your guildmate first. We will also be focused on life in Norrath being more than just the battle -- other skills are given to you for a reason. Want to learn how to tailor? You&#39;ve got to start with the basics, and if you and a couple of guildmates want a nice quiet night, why not go out together and gather spiderling silks to get going? Or get together for a trip to Steamfont to pick up some supplies for smithing? <br>\n<p>We will also be planning raids for various levels, a couple of parties... and maybe even a wedding or two. ) <br>\n<p>So if you&#39;re interested in helping us create this guild, just to have fun, either leave a post here, or email to akane@... with your character name, level, class and race, along with an email address where we can reach you. <br>\n<p>Look forward to hearing from you! ) <br>\n<p>***Akane<br>Wood Elf Ranger of 13 seasons</p></font></div><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com/\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
