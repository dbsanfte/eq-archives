I feel I am knowledgeable about many things in<br/>\n&gt; regards to each class, race, etc. Yet, there is the one question<br/>\n&gt; that evades me.. For the &quot;Knight&quot; classes, (Shadowknights and<br/>\n&gt; Paladins), what is better..the traditional 1hs or the 2hs. I have<br/>\n&gt; seen people, including my friends who do 2hs, and some that do 1hs.<br/>\n&gt; What are the pros and cons of each...so I can decide which way to go<br/>\n&gt; with my new pally...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
