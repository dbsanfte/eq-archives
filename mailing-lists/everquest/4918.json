It amounts to no more than going <br/>\nto hundreds of vendors, over and over again to find a page, or words <br/>\nor rune, buy it and then have it fail when you try to make the <br/>\nspell.  The idea is to have you kill mobs for it.....but the mobs <br/>\nare allways higher level, and rarely drop it when you want it.  By <br/>\nthe time you get the pages or runes you need for your 16th level <br/>\nspell......you&#39;re 32nd level.  So you have to buy them, at inflated <br/>\nprices, and thats IF you can find them.  Then after going thru all <br/>\nthat....poof...it fails, and you have to start all over again.  A <br/>\nstupid idea.  Why not have the spells drop off certin mobs like a <br/>\nquest, so then peeps will camp them, oh my, don&#39;t have a good <br/>\nsoultion, but current one is not fun.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
