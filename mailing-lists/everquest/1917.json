I think you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; right in that they&#39;ve built on EQ and are better,<br/>\n&gt; much in the same way that EQ was better than UO when<br/>\n&gt; it came out.  I figure that we&#39;re all consumers and<br/>\n&gt; we play the best game.  It&#39;s nice to have the<br/>\n&gt; marketplace competition as each game tries to outdo<br/>\n&gt; the other.  There&#39;s nothing wrong or disloyal in<br/>\n&gt; switching RPGs, and there will be nothing wrong with<br/>\n&gt; switching back if/when EQ revamps itself.<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Keith J.

Dark Age<br/>\n&gt; has had the benefit of hindsight and learning from<br/>\n&gt; EQ&#39;s mistakes.  They have built upon them.  There is<br/>\n&gt; less downtime, more character specialization, less<br/>\n&gt; annoying corpse runs, better graphics, easier<br/>\n&gt; grouping, and better pvp.  DAoC is better than EQ<br/>\n&gt; currently, however, to EQ&#39;s credit -- Dark Age<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be what it is if it hadn&#39;t been for EQ&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; experience.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   If you like EQ, I think you&#39;ll like Dark Age if<br/>\n&gt; not as much, perhaps better.  The only drawback is<br/>\n&gt; that you need a pretty high-end system for smooth<br/>\n&gt; play (particularly a good graphics card).<br/>\n&gt;     -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;     From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LeSamLam@...\">LeSamLam@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LeSamLam@...\">LeSamLam@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;     Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 8:14 AM<br/>\n&gt;     To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;     Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Camelot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     My husband has been playing it.  In fact, after<br/>\n&gt; a few days, he cancelled his EQ account and is<br/>\n&gt; solely playing DAoC.  He keeps telling me to try it<br/>\n&gt; but I tell him I like EQ just fine.  From watching<br/>\n&gt; him, I can tell I don&#39;t wanna play.  BUT he&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; hardcore gamer and EQ and Solitaire are the only<br/>\n&gt; games I play.  He says it&#39;s like EQ but better.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Lena <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       have u guys (anyone I mean) heard of the new<br/>\n&gt; Dark Ages <br/>\n&gt;       of Camelot game??
