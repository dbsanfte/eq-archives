I<br/>\nthink it was inr esponse to a lot of people complaining that the class<br/>\nadvancement was not very fair between casters to melee.  In a caster class<br/>\nyou get spells about every 5 levels even if you don&#39;t gain any new<br/>\nabilities.  But for melee classes, by the time you reach level 30 you&#39;ve<br/>\ngained all the skills you&#39;re going to receive until level 51.  So unless<br/>\nyou&#39;ve got the money and can continue to buy better weapons every 5 levels,<br/>\nyou could potentially be using the same stuff from level 30 to level 51.<br/>\nThat&#39;s not very far across the board if you ask me.  So I believe the<br/>\ndiscipline tomes were introduced  to give melee classes somethign to work on<br/>\nduring those 20 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWulfric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Chris Talbot&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chris@...\">chris@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 13, 2004 12:09 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EverQuest] Disciplines?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yeah. They&#39;re bought for 2 cp each in the PoK Library. Full melee classes<br/>\n&gt; get them around 30th level, while hybrids have to wait until 51st (my<br/>\nmain,<br/>\n&gt; a ranger, is just about nearing the point where I can get his first<br/>\n&gt; Discipline -- the Resistant Discipline, I believe, which is the one<br/>\nwarriors<br/>\n&gt; get at 30th or 31st).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Disciplines have been in the game for some time now. Someone who has been<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; the game for a few years could probably shed more light on exactly how old<br/>\n&gt; they are. I&#39;ve only played since January 2003, and I think they might&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been around at that time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once you have the Discipline book, you open it and learn the Discipline.<br/>\n&gt; Each Discipline has certain benefits (Resistant bumps up all your<br/>\n&gt; resistances, for instances). They last for a certain amount of time, but<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; can only use them once every X number of hours of play. There&#39;s a window<br/>\n&gt; that you can pull up (can&#39;t remember the command to open it up) that lets<br/>\n&gt; you activate the Disciplines.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
