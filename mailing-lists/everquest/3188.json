Weapon skill has a major effect \non your attack abilities. The maximum skill you can have in a weapon type I \nthink is Level * 5 + 5, so the highest skill you could have in 1hs at level 11 \nis 60 which is much higher than the 25 you currently have. Generally you should \ntry to get your skills up in all available&nbsp;weapon types as you might get \nyour hands on something really nice and you will want to have at least some \nability with it. So yeah you should alternate between the weapon types and try \nto be good at each one.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div>----- Original Message ----- </div>\n<blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"rlebeau65@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">Rob LeBeau</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, July 10, 2002 7:35 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Warrior and skills \n  question</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>Ok, I have a level 11 warrior and would like \n  your<br>opinion on the following:<br><br>I started wondering why I was not \n  hitting that much<br>with him even though he has a good weapon. After \n  some<br>research, I found that the reason I am not hitting as<br>much as \n  others is because I have been switching<br>between 2HS and 1HS weapons to \n  increase the skills of<br>each attribute.&nbsp; <br><br>Example: My skill in \n  both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br>attack is at like 152.&nbsp; If I were to just \n  use 1HS<br>let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br><br>I have \n  proved this because now that I am using the 1HS<br>more, the skill is close to \n  30 and my ATK rating is<br>close to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is still \n  at<br>152.<br><br><br>Would you continue to alternate both weapon types \n  or<br>would you just pick one and go with \n  it?<br><br>THanks<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do \n  You Yahoo!?<br>Sign up for SBC Yahoo!
