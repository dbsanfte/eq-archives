I made Locate and Corpse hotkeys <br/>\nearly on for corpse runs.  But I hate the XP loss.  I died 3 times <br/>\nlast week, which added another 2 days before I reached 38.  I have no <br/>\nguild or high level friends to depend either, so I go where I know I <br/>\ncan get back to.  But I do have a Druid cousin that jumps me around <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s on.  So spend a few minutes scouting before you jump in!  <br/>\nLearn from your mistakes!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you get to Kunark your solo career is limited.  There are just <br/>\ntoo many mob&#39;s and too big a chance of a bad pull.  I have seen <br/>\nDruids quadkiting in the OT and I saw one go down on an overpull.  It <br/>\nhelps to group until you get a feel for the area.
