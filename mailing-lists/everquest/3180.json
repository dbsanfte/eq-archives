You might not want to put a housefan that close to your <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; computer. Fans<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that size have an electromagnetic field that can cause <br/>\n&gt; problems. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some fans<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can disrupt monitors if too close. It can even erase or <br/>\n&gt; corrupt <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; data on your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harddrive. It&#39;s best to use a device specifically designed <br/>\nfor <br/>\n&gt; &gt; use <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer rather than something like that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Amy Williams&quot; &lt;amy_e_williams@h...&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
