I have<br/>\n&gt; learned over my many years of traveling throughout the great world of<br/>\n&gt; Norrath, that the more I THINK I know about this world, the more I realize<br/>\n&gt; how much I DON&#39;T know.  For that reason my fellow adventurers, I propose<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; we generate a list of TIPS that each of us can both share with others and<br/>\n&gt; learn from for ourselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here are my proposed rules (subject to modification and advice from<br/>\nothers):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Only provide 1 or 2 tips at a time, you can add others each day, but<br/>\nlets<br/>\n&gt; keep these posts short, pithy and informative (less time reading is more<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; playing!!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Tips can be general, trade, race or class specific, so to save time for<br/>\n&gt; all, use the subject line in your post to announce what kind of tip you<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; providing. ie -  &quot;General TIP&quot;, Tailoring TIP&quot;, &quot;Wizard TIP&quot;, &quot;Human TIP&quot;<br/>\n&gt; .....,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3)  The best TIPS will be those that are not readily apparent, found in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; manual or just plain common sense.  This list should appeal to both<br/>\nnewbies<br/>\n&gt; and veterans alike, but the best TIPS will be those that someone reads and<br/>\n&gt; goes &quot;ahhhhh, wow - I never knew that!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, I think that&#39;s enough of a format to see how this works.  So come on<br/>\n&gt; lads and lasses, let&#39;s start an information revolution the likes of this<br/>\n&gt; LISTSERV has never seen!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To get this EQonelist EverQuest TIP LIST off the ground, I will submit my<br/>\n&gt; first two TIPS:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GENERAL TIP<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1)  When trading with NPCs in a new city or town (or any town for that<br/>\n&gt; matter) /con (&quot;consider&quot;) a bunch of the trading NPCs and see which ones<br/>\nlook<br/>\n&gt; at you the friendliest.  You will get better prices for both sales and<br/>\n&gt; purchases of items from these NPCs than ones who look at you indifferently<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; negatively.  This can save you up 30%!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GENERAL TIP<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2)  Never  /shout &quot;HELP!&quot;  - Shouts are heard throughout the entire zone<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; most players that could help you realize that the zone is huge and you are<br/>\n&gt; unlikely to be near enough to rescue, thus, they will rarely bother to<br/>\neven<br/>\n&gt; look.  Always use /say &quot;help&quot;  - Then, whoever hears it will know that you<br/>\n&gt; are in the immediate area and will often come to your aid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wizaro<br/>\n&gt; Erudite Wizard currently residing in Halas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; With more than 14 million emails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ...ONElist IS the place where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
