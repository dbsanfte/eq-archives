Well, I got a computer this way... \n  (I know, I know...) Anyway, it arrived yesterday, but it will not turn on. \n  It&#39;s like it&#39;s not getting power. When I hit the power switch, I can see the \n  red light coming on for a sec, so SOME power is getting to it.... but it won&#39;t \n  come on. The hubby and I have taken it apart and looked in it, but neither of \n  us really knows enough about computers to tell what might be wrong. </p>\n  <p>I&#39;ve emailed the ppl I got it from, but haven&#39;t heard back from them yet. \n  (I&nbsp; just emailed them last night, so I&#39;ll give them til tomorrow to \n  answer). </p>\n  <p>I know I haven&#39;t supplied a lot of info, but I was just wondering if you \n  guys could throw out some ideas of what could be causing this.</p>\n  <p>Thanks. :)</p><br><br><font face=\"Verdana\" color=\"purple\" size=\"4\">The happiness \n  you seek is right where you left it.<br></font>\n  <p><br>\n  <hr SIZE=\"1\">\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webhosting.yahoo.com/ps/wh3/prod/\">Yahoo! \n  Web Hosting</a> - establish your business online <br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
