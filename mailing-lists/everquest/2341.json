At lvl 13<br>you&#39;re getting into the level range for Crocs in<br>Oasis, just head down there and solo or duo yourself<br>up to 19-20. (groups larger than two people at that<br>point just slow down the experience gain) Since you&#39;re<br>new, i&#39;ll give you directions how to get there. Take<br>the teleport from The Nexus down to West Commonlands,<br>go east from there to the East Commonlands and ask<br>someone to show you where the EC Tunnel is. Go thru<br>the tunnel turning right at the Shady Swashbuckler<br>into Northern Desert of Ro. Head to the left til you<br>hit the water and follow the beach to the Oasis of<br>Marr. Continue following the beach til you get to the<br>docks there, that&#39;s the rest stop in Oasis. Just go<br>further down the beach and look for crocs of various<br>levels to kill. (starting with Crocodiles and Caimans<br>on the low end, til Deepwater Crocs on the high end)<br><br>Once you ding 20, head either to *shudder* LOIO (Lake<br>of Ill Omen) on Kunark, or my personal preferance, the<br>Karanas. (Eastern, Northern and Southern Plains of<br>Karana) I&#39;m not too familiar with the Beastlord class,<br>but as a pet class you shouldn&#39;t have too much<br>difficulty soloing in the Karanas. You&#39;ll be a little<br>more likely to find groups in LOIO if that&#39;s what you<br>really want, but friendly groups? Probably not. LOIO<br>is the haven for all the mouthy thirteen year olds who<br>want to bicker over the &quot;phat lewt&quot; dropped by a<br>Sarnak. It also happens to be the best XP spot in the<br>game for that level range and there is halfway decent<br>coin on the MOBs. Pick your poison. :) <br><br>As for roleplaying, I can&#39;t speak for FV as a server<br>myself not having played there. I suppose your best<br>bet is to come up with a good roleplaying<br>justification for people to want to group with you. In<br>terms of simply enjoying the game mechanics though,<br>grouping with any more than one person before level 20<br>is just going to slow down your progress. :)<br><br>______________________________________________________________________ <br>Web-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca/\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com/\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
