My heart is tired, but I must not <br/>\nfalter. I met my comrades on the field. Still and quiet. Only the <br/>\ncrickets give evidence of life beyond our keep. Today will be another <br/>\nrough day. I bolster my faith, surrounding myself with it like a <br/>\npiece of impregnable armor. I know that many will go out to meet <br/>\ntheir death and only a few will return. For all our sakes, I must put <br/>\nthat aside and mourn later. For now it is war. I am needed to give <br/>\nheart, faith and healing to my comrades. If I must, I will help as <br/>\nwell. Not that someone like me could do much. I pray to Tunare for <br/>\nstrength and guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll communications are in and the report is not good. Our scouts have <br/>\ngiven us a target. An army of orcs is controlling the southern path <br/>\nletting us know that we shall not pass. Our troops are ready to move <br/>\nout. I only pray that everyone will return. I look at the faces of <br/>\nthose with me, those in my group and those beyond. They are anxious. <br/>\nThey know the risks and yet the shouts and glory of victory drive <br/>\nthem like a cruel master. They look to me for comfort and to keep <br/>\nthem going. I hope I do not fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe reach the gate, but the enemy is nowhere to be seen. The stink is <br/>\nfresh. Do we venture forth or stay behind where it is safe? Our <br/>\norders are clear, we must continue forward. We must keep them from <br/>\npenning between our keep and their forces. Group by group we venture <br/>\nforward along the path.<br/>\n<br/>\nA flash of light and some music. I can&#39;t move. The brutishness of our <br/>\nfoes keeps me rooted in place. All around me I hear the screams of <br/>\nagony mixed with their terrible howls of victory. The orcs have <br/>\nsurrounded us cutting off our escape route. I see my friends and <br/>\nfellow fighters going down one by one under the cruel swords of the <br/>\nbrutish orcs. I am helpless. I see them looking to for help and it <br/>\nbreaks my heart. How cruel this enemy is, to leave me with sight and <br/>\nhearing, yet deprive me of movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel my hands start to glow. I begin the motions, healing as I can, <br/>\ntrying to heal those around me that are still standing. I once again <br/>\nsummon my faith to provide a bunker for those left as I race to save <br/>\nthose who may yet be living. Frantically, I race against time to save <br/>\none then another hoping I can stay strong. Our enemies, those that <br/>\nthreaten my homeland, are strong. I am not sure how much longer I can <br/>\nhold out. I can feel the energy draining away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBehind me I hear the sound of fresh troops bearing down on us and I <br/>\nsend a hurried prayer of thanks to Tunare. Re-enforcements have <br/>\narrived. Somewhere inside me, I find the power to continue healing <br/>\nand bolstering as much as I can. I watch as our enemies slowly fall <br/>\nbeneath our forces until there are none left. Gratefully, I regroup. <br/>\nLooking around, I see that most of us still live. Able to return to <br/>\nour keep victorious.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are celebrations, joyful reunions and tales to be told. I hang <br/>\nback. Today we were lucky; tomorrow we will face death again. How can <br/>\nwe hold out? I don&#39;t know, but I cannot give up the faith. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my calling.<br/>\nMy vocation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a cleric.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
