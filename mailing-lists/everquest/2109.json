This mainly involves<br/>\nselling the items you have tailored to other players.  I like this skill<br/>\nbecause most of the tailoring material is dropped from animals which you<br/>\ncan gain experience killing, so you don&#39;t have to take time out fighting<br/>\nmobs to go back to town just to practice your trade.  Using info from the<br/>\ntwo links below, I was mass producing and selling weight reduction<br/>\nbackpacks for about 100pp each at level 15.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/000675.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/000675.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqtraders.com/\">http://www.eqtraders.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nMackmillan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 7 Jan 2002, davidgraye wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: davidgraye &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bm_dlgray@...\">bm_dlgray@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Mon, 07 Jan 2002 22:07:36 -0000<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] New Player<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello All<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know I&#39;m about 20 years late, but I&#39;m making that transition from<br/>\n&gt; Ultima Online and MUD to EQ.
