That would be hilarious. And i wish I<br/>\ncould have it talk. Like I could say /pet come here&quot; and it would say<br/>\n&quot;Coming mommy&quot; or something like that. I don&#39;t like the pet saying master<br/>\nthing.<br/>\nI actually find that I get a slight bit distressed when I can&#39;t find my<br/>\nlittle flappy. I start looking around for him. It&#39;s funny.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL I call mine Flappy too and feed him treats, emote him purring, biting<br/>\nppl who are snotty to me, etc. It&#39;s at least a cool idea...and really, a<br/>\nactual pet of any sort would make a wiz overpowered if you think about it.<br/>\nI&#39;m content with my lil guy, even if he is just a visible buff.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Steven R.

I mean thanks for the info<br/>\n  but if they can&#39;t fight then what good are they? I guess it&#39;s cool to<br/>\n  have it follow you around and stuff.

My<br/>\n  wizard spent a good 3 hours medding and fizzling just trying to get her<br/>\n  familiar back. I&#39;ve never noticed any change in my fizzles or anything<br/>\n  after<br/>\n  a successful summoning. And sometimes it runs off and I can&#39;t find it.<br/>\n  But<br/>\n  it&#39;s fun to have it just following around and flapping it&#39;s little<br/>\n  wings.<br/>\n  When I&#39;m bored I just talk to my familiar and emote I&#39;m feeding it<br/>\n  cookies.<br/>\n  Too bad you can&#39;t name your familiars. I call mine Flappy.<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Familiar is a wizard&#39;s pet.

I used to have a wiz at one point<br/>\n  but it never had this spell until like a higher level. Hmm, cool. You<br/>\n  know, I think I may have met you the other night, Someone, (I can&#39;t<br/>\n  remember their name now), was talking with their pet, It was kind of<br/>\n  funny at first I didn&#39;t realize it was their pet and thought it was<br/>\n  another person! ;-) It was at the Orc lift in Felwith.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
