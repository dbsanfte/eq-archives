Woodelves have the<br/>\nborn-with-skill to Hide.  However, when I was watching them play with<br/>\nHide (they were lvl4-6), I could still see them.  On their screen they were<br/>\nhidden and they can nolonger see their character, but I can see them plainly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Once in awhile I see them disappear, but most of the time I still see them<br/>\neven though they said they got the message &quot;you are hidden&quot; and they can<br/>\nno longer see themselves in any camera view.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Is this a bug, are they doing something wrong, or do Humans have a chance<br/>\nof seeing them even though they are hidden from other eyes?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n //Aldaren the Human, woodelf spotting, cleric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
