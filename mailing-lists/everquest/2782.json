Dont ever ask for powerleveling. If you<br/>\nhave a REALLY good friend and are considering switching main class you could<br/>\nask for this to get some levels. smashing 10000 rats again isnt fun really.<br/>\nBut as you point out you need to learn to play the new class. Some are<br/>\nskilled some are not. Be humble when you try new classes, ask for advice<br/>\nfrom your friends. Ive played all classes for several levels post 40 with<br/>\nthe exception of mage. If I wanted to switch to any id definiately arrange<br/>\npowerleveling so I can go on the guildraids again. This discussion is too<br/>\nblack/white. Powerleveling isnt the devil, its lack of skills that are. If<br/>\nyou gained items to twink out a character someone earned those items just<br/>\nlive with it. But level is never going to win over skills since in the end<br/>\nyou cant rely only on level and gear. You gotta know how to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith over 300days inside eq I have a fairly good view how to play most<br/>\nclasses. (in raid situations definately, in the exp grind depending on the<br/>\nscenery it might be some holes in specific situations). Dont generalize too<br/>\nmuch, doesnt help. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I very much agree on DONT BEG STRANGERS FOR PL, that sucks very hard. <br/>\n<br/>\n/Ranina<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: bigmaca3 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmaca3@...\">bigmaca3@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 30, 2002 1:16 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Re: Hello I am new<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;J.

There are points in the game where your role changes.  I <br/>\nhave been through 3 of them already.  If you don&#39;t play the lower <br/>\nlevels of your class you miss a valuable learning experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard all of the excuses, it&#39;s boring, I&#39;ve already done it, <br/>\netc.  So, they run an SK up to 30 with PL and Twinking.  They <br/>\nfigure &quot;I was a Warrior before, now I just have spells too&quot; and then <br/>\nget their party killed because they don&#39;t know how to play the SK <br/>\nproperly.  But that&#39;s everyone elses fault!  Because before their <br/>\nprotector buffed them up or twinked them out to the point that the <br/>\nmobs couldn&#39;t hurt them, so why couldn&#39;t the group?  Then it&#39;s a TPW, <br/>\ncorpse run and the SK is on the /Ignore list!<br/>\n<br/>\nI laugh when I see a blueberry run by with a Skeleton chasing them <br/>\nbecause they can&#39;t hurt it, but it can hurt them.  They beg me to <br/>\nhelp them, silly twink.  Go to your well deserved death, I&#39;ll kill <br/>\nthem mob when it finishes you.  You shouldn&#39;t pick on reds just <br/>\nbecause your daddy gave you Lambant armor to wear!<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, maybe I&#39;m bitter too! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my advice is to enjoy them game and play for every level you <br/>\nget.  If some kind soul casts a SoW or other buff on you, thank <br/>\nthem.  If someone offers you a weapon or armor, thank them.  If you <br/>\nbeg for these things they may let the Mob kill you, but if your Karma <br/>\nis right they may help.  Never expect anything, you&#39;ll never be be <br/>\ndisappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember when you see a newbie struggling that you were there <br/>\nonce.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeath to all Twinks! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n35th season Ranger of Tunare. <br/>\nTerris-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
