I wouldn&#39;t hunt any of <br/>\nthe &quot;Light&quot; races just because of the roleplay aspect.  But that&#39;s <br/>\njust me.  But I do remember seeing trains of Dorfs following a wolf.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have LoY?  Gunthak is in your level, plenty of mobs and a good <br/>\nspawn rate.  From there you can move on to Dulak and work the yard, <br/>\nthen the boats.  And they drop gems!  I usually stagger out of there <br/>\nwith 200-300 plat in items and gems, after a group split!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Druids do have a role in LDoN.  I know you don&#39;t like to group, <br/>\nbut you&#39;re missing a lot.  Just be careful.  I&#39;ve gotten a few <br/>\nquestionable groups, with the usual dire results.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\nPathfinder of Tunare<br/>\nTerris-Thule, Summoners of the Realm<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Don Gibson &lt;hoggtyed@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I lved my druid to from 39 to 50 on the dwarven<br/>\n&gt; citizens in Butcher Block mountains There are 13 of<br/>\n&gt; them on citizen faction,  there faction hit does not<br/>\n&gt; effect guards or your faction needed for your epic. <br/>\n&gt; They drop ringmail, finesteel, up to 5pp and always a<br/>\n&gt; bronze axe.
