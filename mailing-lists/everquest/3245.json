But my phone company has a monopoly in the area and won&#39;t do<br/>\nanything about it. I can&#39;t even get them to do maintenance that they are<br/>\nsupposed to be required to do. I&#39;m going to have to call someone above their<br/>\nheads to get something done.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Gotta hope you get that connection problem licked. Especially with<br/>\n&gt; such a nice rig as you have described.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I absolutely hate game death and try to avoid it whenever possible.<br/>\n&gt; I let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people know right off that if I think I am going to get killed I<br/>\n&gt; will flee.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A dead cleric isn&#39;t very helpful. Especially since I only have a<br/>\n&gt; 21.6k<br/>\n&gt; &gt; connection and we&#39;re talking about waiting 5 or more minutes to<br/>\n&gt; reload from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; death. When my mother is playing also, my zoning like that can<br/>\n&gt; cause her to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lag very badly. If she has to zone or gets killed then one or both<br/>\n&gt; of us get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; booted offline. And I lose alot of xp. So that isn&#39;t fun.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings toward<br/>\n&gt; game<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s attitudes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; toward game death?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; awkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nasty.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server.<br/>\n&gt; He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and<br/>\n&gt; tactics<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but<br/>\n&gt; enjoy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
