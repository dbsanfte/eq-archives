I am a lvl 10 bard - just made 10.  I tried my hand at doing some soloing while lvl 9 (Bards not necessarily being the best solo class - although some bards swear by it at certain levels.)  I good solo strategy is to stick near zone borders to retreat safely if you get in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example - you&#39;re in a group - and a high-level meany zeroes in on you -  have to zone out to survive...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn these cases - you have to get the zone time twice - going in and back.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m kind of impatient - but two 30-second hits is kind of annoying...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Shannon Upham <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 07, 1999 1:32 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] zoning<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think I have spent more time reading about zoning than actually zoning.....<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Whitmore, Lance &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lwhitmore@...\">lwhitmore@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Friday, May 07, 1999 2:26 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [EverQuest] zoning<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I agree.. id rather just enjoy the game. hehe  :) <br/>\n<br/>\n    but the original zone entry lag i think is due to your video card setting up your current point of view as you turn your heading it puts into the video card memory whatever it needs to process the objects in your current video.. if you do a complete 180 it seems to load up all the texture data around you and stores it there to retrive it, making your system run smooth. Areas with complex buildings seem to chop the system till it places it into memory and from then on it seems slick.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I love this game..  hehe <br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message----- <br/>\n    From: Lary, William [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WLary@...\">WLary@...</a>] <br/>\n    Sent: Friday, May 07, 1999 2:11 PM <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n    Subject: Re: [EverQuest] zoning <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    From: &quot;Lary, William&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WLary@...\">WLary@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    here is another interesting part, after i zone i usually notice <br/>\n    that my HD is stiill processing info, i have control of my character <br/>\n    but for about 10-15 additional seconds, sometimes as little as 5 seconds <br/>\n    after i regain control of my character after a zone, <br/>\n      when i turn or start to move there is this &quot;processing lag&quot; dont know <br/>\n    what else to call it but i think THIS is when you receive the info   <br/>\n    regarding <br/>\n    other players etc in the zone. for it does seem to take longer to get <br/>\n    out of this post zone (processing lag)-jerky movents etc when there <br/>\n    are lots of players)pcs) etc as opposed when their are very few.  PCs <br/>\n    creating more lag  would seem logical for most NPCs dont have lots of   <br/>\n    items with various stats, and or skills, etc speech trade skills etc to   <br/>\n    have to load into memory as PCs do, unless someone can pretty much prove   <br/>\n    to me that NPCs and PCs should have no effect, i will have to conclude   <br/>\n    that my observation is correct, <br/>\n    Doublestar <br/>\n<br/>\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n    Join the Star Wars craze! <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\n    Set up your Star Wars list at ONElist. <br/>\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n    Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
