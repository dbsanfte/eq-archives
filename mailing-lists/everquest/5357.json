People who sit in front of the TV and watch all day. I used to<br/>\ndo that. Now I play on my computer. But at least when I play on my computer<br/>\nI exercise my mind more. and I type and get some movement going. I also get<br/>\nto socialize. I think there are important lessons to be learned from playing<br/>\nan online game. You have to learn about social things. How to interact with<br/>\nothers, how to operate in a group and use teamwork. And you learn what<br/>\nhappens when you do not work well with others. I am someone who might be<br/>\nconsidered &quot;addicted&quot; by some because I pretty much do nothing but play EQ<br/>\nor play on my computer when I&#39;m not sleeping. however, I have a heart<br/>\ncondition and suffer from chronic fatigue so I don&#39;t get out of the house<br/>\nand do much for health reasons. I would be pretty damned bored without EQ.<br/>\nEspecially with the weather as cold as it is now.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can beg all you want /grin. I don&#39;t think that it is the game that is<br/>\nthe problem. The problem is self-esteem for the one woman. The day you see<br/>\nsomeone go into DTs from EQ, you can talk to me about it being an addiction.<br/>\nThese people play too much for other reasons (insecurity, mental problems,<br/>\nwithdrawal). If they were not hiding in EQ they would be hiding elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nAwulfie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.544 / Virus Database: 338 - Release Date: 11/25/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
