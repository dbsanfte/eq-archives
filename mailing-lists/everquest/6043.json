I <br/>\ncan count on being killed 1 in 3x&#39;s I visit Qeynos--where I have high <br/>\nfaction with gaurds and merchants. I am only marginally liked in <br/>\nSurefall Glade--my spawn point. I get killed everywhere I go--even by <br/>\nsingle dark blue monsters. How do I correct this? Or is this normal? <br/>\n<br/>\nI leveled twice yesterday! Back to lvl 19. I love playing this guy, <br/>\nbut I want to be able to roam a little. I think I will build another <br/>\ncharacter using the knowledge I have aquired over the last couple of <br/>\nweeks. I have been reading and asking a lot of questions. Any advice <br/>\nyou guys have on a new hef rgr for me will be greatly appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am also thinking of building a gnome...well maybe later.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
