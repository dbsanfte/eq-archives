The first thing<br/>\nI want to get cleared up is, are there any legal ramifications in the<br/>\nreal world that any of us whom may decide to assist you in this &quot;quest&quot;<br/>\ncan get into? I mean no insult by this question; just want to clear up<br/>\nany confusion. <br/>\nSecond, do I understand correctly that this is a harmless role-playing<br/>\ngame you two are doing and you would basically like some others to join<br/>\nyou or &quot;play along&quot; so to speak? If so hey I&#39;m cool with that.  <br/>\nThird, got a pic of this evil dark elf? One can&#39;t very well go around<br/>\nhacking every female dark elf they see. That would be like someone<br/>\nrunning around saying that this watery tart threw him a sword and now he<br/>\nis king that would be absurd! <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and off topic, Dude! Your outfit rocks! <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nMessage: 1<br/>\n   Date: Fri, 16 Aug 2002 02:28:39 -0400<br/>\n   From: &quot;WULF Tech&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Savawulf&#39;s Ransom<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the scoop:<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong my many characters I play a half-elf ranger named Savawulf on the<br/>\nCazic Thule server.  Savawulf is a member of the Draconis Rampant guild.<br/>\nRecently some events have come to pass where Savawulf was wronged by<br/>\nanother member of the DR guild.  An evil dark elf necromancer named<br/>\nKethryveris Ashkeveron.  Watch out for her if you ever meet her.  She&#39;s<br/>\nvery evil and cannot be trusted!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story is thatSavawulf had a very valuable item stolen from him in<br/>\nreal life - out of game that is.  Now, the person behind the evil dark<br/>\nelf lady is holding this item for ransom.  Seeing that I have  no<br/>\nreprieve, I feel it is in my best interest for the safety of this item<br/>\nto be returned that I just comply with her wishes.  Therefore, For the<br/>\nfull story, plese go to the following website:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/savawulf\">http://www.geocities.com/savawulf</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find the details there.   Incidentally, I also cross posted this<br/>\nto the Draconis Rampant message board, and curiously enough, the<br/>\nSavatage fan page messageboard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid to see what kind of responses I get.  I&#39;ll probably end up<br/>\ngetting sued by the band for copying their song without permission, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s a chance I&#39;m going to have to take if I am to get this very<br/>\nvaluable item back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this hsan&#39;t piqued your curiosity enough, I don&#39;t know what will.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the page.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully, <br/>\nSavawulf Tageric<br/>\n15th Season HEF RNG<br/>\nCazic thule server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
