It was so laggy you really <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t play.  I gave it 6 weeks and saw only minor improvements.  <br/>\nBut the worst part were the missions all got boring.

Read some of the AO <br/>\nsites.  You can find them on most of the major EQ sites.  These guys <br/>\nwere terrible!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll stick with EQ.
