I kept getting a message saying<br/>\n&gt; something like my<br/>\n&gt; will isn&#39;t right to command this weapon. What does<br/>\n&gt; that mean? That I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not able to use it or more specifically my class<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t wield this<br/>\n&gt; weapon as well as others? Heck I seemed to be<br/>\n&gt; kicking some butt with it<br/>\n&gt; as my hits were ranking between 12-16 points each.<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
