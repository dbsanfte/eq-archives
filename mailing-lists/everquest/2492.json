My brother in law is a cpa, and <br/>\nat the end of tax season he looks like he has been beaten up.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry looking at alakhazam or caster&#39;s realm for something on quests. <br/>\nAs to names, try out ones that are easy to type. makes it easier on <br/>\nother players. My first druid had a long name. This one just started <br/>\nas Barto. My warrior, Bartoo. My magician i called martondo, a bit <br/>\nlonger but easy to type, and the best I could think of at the time <br/>\nthat the game would accept.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet some maps from the eq atlas, a link from alakhazam. I have quite <br/>\na few printed and in a binder for easy reference. better than getting <br/>\nlost.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen playing solo you have to find your own play style. I tend to be <br/>\ncautious, exploring with care and engaging mostly things that are <br/>\nblue. My son&#39;s play a bit more boldly, less concerned with getting <br/>\nkilled. Though the one that is a mid-40&#39;s shadow knight has become a <br/>\nbit more cautious after learning how expensive higher level deaths <br/>\ncan be.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, and look into trade skills. a nice part of the game for those <br/>\nwho find it interesting. Some very high level quests require some <br/>\ngood trade skills, so they can be worthwhile, especially if you enjoy <br/>\npursuing the advancements. Not the same thrill as hack and loot, but <br/>\nsome of us find this aspect fun.<br/>\n<br/>\ngood hunting to you.<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., nara MKs &lt;masterkiis_nara@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So many questions, so little time....am really bummed<br/>\n&gt; because with it being tax season and all I am not<br/>\n&gt; getting much game time...Is really hard for this<br/>\n&gt; newbie who is itching to play, play, play...Here is my<br/>\n&gt; question though...I already have two characters that I<br/>\n&gt; play with my boyfriend but am wanting to add a couple<br/>\n&gt; characters to play with when he is over at<br/>\n&gt; Fennin...While I am too afraid to play her now, I have<br/>\n&gt; thoughts of an Enchanter but am also thinking of a<br/>\n&gt; Druid character...I have a name for my Enchanter but<br/>\n&gt; am at a loss for something really creative for my<br/>\n&gt; Druid...Any suggestions on websites for research for a<br/>\n&gt; name?  Guess I could go to Google but I thought I<br/>\n&gt; would check with you guys first.  Also, any<br/>\n&gt; suggestions for a really easy quest for my Cleric? <br/>\n&gt; One I might be able to do fairly easily on my own?  I<br/>\n&gt; have got to start learning this game on my own instead<br/>\n&gt; of just doing what HE tells me to do...you know, AUTO<br/>\n&gt; FOLLOW, ASSIST, Here take this..LOL...LOL...I keep<br/>\n&gt; running around Freeport afraid to go out cause I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know if I could find my way back...I sound pathetic<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t I?? :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Naara, Barb Warrior<br/>\n&gt;  Chryseas, High Elf Cleric<br/>\n&gt; Ayonae Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Try FREE Yahoo!
