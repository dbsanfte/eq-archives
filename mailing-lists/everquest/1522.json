My wife likes AOL, and the Compuserve deal was <br/>\ngood for us. Compuserve IS AOL, in every practical way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdded memory and a NVidia card with 32 meg. EQ runs alright. Now that <br/>\nI am learning more about game machines, I am planning on an Alien for <br/>\nmy next computer. However, I think that this one will work well <br/>\nenough for a year or two. I am sure I will know just when the change <br/>\nover must take place. Somewhere where frustration vs available money <br/>\ncross each other on the performance chart.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Emachine needs to be rebooted whenever the game has been played, <br/>\nbut while in the game I have no performance problems that seem <br/>\nexcessive or unreasonable for a mid-level system. Compuserve is not <br/>\ngreat, but adequate. I would love DSL, but it is still $50 a month in <br/>\nmy location.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto of Rivervale</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
