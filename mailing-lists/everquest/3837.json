It took a while and some work to get all the <br/>\narmor, but it was well worth it.  At 15th now and have over 100 str , <br/>\n100 sta, and 100wis without having had to dumped all the training <br/>\npoints into any of them..I increased cha, dex, and int and <br/>\nwis..because after 9th, a ranger is also a druid and need wis for <br/>\nmana.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut a few into each, but remember that the Trueshot Chainmail <br/>\nincreases STR and STA for EVERY piece.  I have included the stats <br/>\nbelow.   Take it from someone who had the ringmail that was weighting <br/>\nhim down and now has the relatively feather light trueshot chainmail <br/>\nand loving it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost every piece increases the STR enough to cover the items weight <br/>\nand in some cases more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you do these quests at the appropriate time, everything should <br/>\nprovide you with experience.  Crushbone will be your chosen hunting <br/>\nground because 80% of the stuff you need drops there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are or soon plan to be, a big orange hostess treat, then <br/>\nignore my comments, because NOOB armor is beneath most twinkies even <br/>\nat low levels.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBoots:    STR+2 STA+3 AC5<br/>\nBracers:  STR+1 STA+4 AC4 -need 2<br/>\nCoif:     STR+1 STA+3 AC5<br/>\nGauntlets:STR+1 STA+4 AC5<br/>\nLeggings: STR+2 STA+3 AC6<br/>\nSleeves:  STR+1 STA+2 AC5<br/>\nTunic:    STR+2 STA+6 AC12<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough rambling from this lurker :)  Have fun all<br/>\n<br/>\nJECII   31 Halfling Druid on Druzzil Ro<br/>\nKajecan 15 WE Ranger on Druzzil Ro<br/>\nSeveral other alts on Druzzul Ro<br/>\n(most in Mystic Council of Knights)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
