Shaman, at the higher<br/>\nlevels, don&#39;t melee very much, if at all. You&#39;ll be<br/>\nthere to buff your group and debuff and slow the mob<br/>\nmostly. So you want to make sure your spells aren&#39;t<br/>\nfizzling every time you try to cast them. Power<br/>\nleveling will increase the chances that your spells<br/>\nwill fizzle more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you zoom up there in levels, you may not<br/>\nquite know how to play your character. The game gets a<br/>\nbit different after level 25, and changes greatly<br/>\nafter 50. So you should take your time and enjoy the<br/>\ngame, and learn how to play your character well. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Gerald Duren &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:godsmacksonlyfan@...\">godsmacksonlyfan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; well i would like to be able to use better<br/>\n&gt; weapons...so WHEN i can hit some thing i hit it<br/>\n&gt; hard...i usaly have to solo it all the time...it sux<br/>\n&gt; bad...<br/>\n&gt; ty and i am greatful for ur imput.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- David Dearstone &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:greystryx@...\">greystryx@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hey, I wouldn&#39;t Power lvl a caster.
