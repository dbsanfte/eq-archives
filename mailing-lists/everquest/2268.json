Before I could port away someone<br/>\nadvertised they were looking for a robe. I told him the stats and he offered<br/>\na price. I lowered the price slightly so he could have some money left over.<br/>\nBut I still made a good profit. :-)<br/>\nOh, I also got to sell a weapon that I&#39;d picked up for a good amount of<br/>\ncoin.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; One particular experience comes to mind. A lvl 14 wood elf needed to<br/>\n&gt; get back home, but was short on cash. I had just ported into the area<br/>\n&gt; where he approached me. Just before that I had gotten a very nice<br/>\n&gt; reward for a few minutes of tracking. I gave the guy a free ride<br/>\n&gt; home. When I arrived in BB I got a tell from someone offering 100pp<br/>\n&gt; for a ride. I took the job. A job I would not have gotten had I not<br/>\n&gt; felt generous after someone else had been generous to me. Sure, I<br/>\n&gt; sometimes get stiffed and sometimes get something I can&#39;t use as a<br/>\n&gt; tip, but for the most part I think I have been well rewarded. For me<br/>\n&gt; it is in character and adds to the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., Jeff Gaudry &lt;bgrifter@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thought I would move the discussion to a new thread.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I considered it myself... :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Now that I can port, I have decided to do so without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;thought of reward. Oh, of course I will go quite a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;bit out of my way for an offer of good money, but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;have found giving a port to someone unable to give<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;much in return seems to add to the game in other ways<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;than money.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m still pondering exactly how I feel about group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ports. I don&#39;t think I could ever feel right about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running around auctioning &quot;Porting to NK, BB, SF, Tox<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and WC for 50pp per seat&quot;, but I do personally think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that a small donation is the right thing when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; recieving a port. (not that i&#39;d ever actively demand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one) As someone who&#39;s probably spent a couple hundred<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plat on ports over the last while, I just see the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; standard 10pp donation is a small way of saying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;thanks for your time&quot;. Again, not required, but a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nice gesture. It&#39;s most certainly a larger commitment<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than SoW... (I still can&#39;t feel right about taking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; donations for a SoW though, the guy with the HQ Bear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pelt was rather persistant, but I usually stubbornly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; refuse &#39;em :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Web-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
