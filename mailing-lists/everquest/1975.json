BTW when everquest was first released there where initial problems<br/>\nwith AMD processors due to its different architecture.  There are a number<br/>\nof games that have issues with them, especially at first release.  It was<br/>\nsoon taken care of.  Fight the addiction and update your pc.. You might want<br/>\nto look at the everquest websites.. They are aware of issues related to the<br/>\nAMD processors and here&#39;s a clip from Abashi:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We apologize for the problems some of you have experienced getting into<br/>\nEverQuest after the launch of Luclin. As of just a bit ago, we patched a new<br/>\ngraphics DLL that fixes the problems some of our users (AMD users in<br/>\nparticular) were experiencing crashing to desktop. This does not mean that<br/>\nall crashes to desktop have been fixed, but this code had the potential for<br/>\na lot of side effects, and fixing it is a big step forward.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey admit the problem..

Also clean your phone jacks but <br/>\n&gt;do not use water. :-) Sometimes just pulling out the phone line and <br/>\n&gt;plugging it back in to the jack can help improve the connection.<br/>\n&gt;I personally went to the trouble of getting special phone cords just for<br/>\n&gt;modems. They were about $12 for 15 feet of cable. They really helped my<br/>\n&gt;connection. They are much thicker than normal phone cords. There are also<br/>\n&gt;some cords that have special coating to sheild them from electrical<br/>\n&gt;discharge. Oh, magnets can screw up connections too. Anything with<br/>\n&gt;electrical or magnetic (or both) fields can disrupt internet connections.<br/>\n&gt;Radios, speakers, and fans are common culprits. Even phones have magnetism.<br/>\n&gt;That is why you should never ever ever set your phone down on a floppy disk<br/>\n&gt;unless you want the disk erased.<br/>\n&gt;Ok, I&#39;ll shut up for real now.<br/>\n&gt;luv,<br/>\n&gt;-Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
