This is because the zones <br/>\n&gt; on each server are split up among many different computers. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From what I can see, when you zone, the game logs you off the <br/>\n&gt; current zone server and then logs you into the new zone server <br/>\n&gt; automatically. This is why sometimes you get kicked back to the <br/>\n&gt; login screen when you are zoning ( the login to the new zone server <br/>\n&gt; time outs ) . <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It would be nice if it could transfer you straight into the zone if it is <br/>\n&gt; on the same zone server, but the way it is setup allows for load <br/>\n&gt; balancing and such which is good ( but damn the wait is <br/>\n&gt; frustrating 8) ) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt; on 06/05/99 09:01:26 <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To:�� <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:everquest@onelist.com\">everquest@onelist.com</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqss@...\">eqss@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; cc:��� (bcc: Michael Wyatt/AU/AMP) <br/>\n&gt; Subject:� [EverQuest] What&#39;s missing in Everquest? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Everquest is best thing what i see in online gaming, from graphic to sound<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and grup sistem but it still miss much things wich leaves too much place <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; concurent products to enter. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First it is hard to add new zones or monsters it request huge uploads ( <br/>\n&gt; this can be corrected with addon discs but it is another question), <br/>\nloading <br/>\n&gt; of zones is realy messed up if you just exit one zone it takes soooo long <br/>\n&gt; to reload it again it will be nice to have 2 zones in memory if you have <br/>\n&gt; enough memory for this (i have 128 mb). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; it is concentrated on gruping but too hard for solo play for some classes <br/>\n&gt; and i dont like to play necromancer or any pet holder, and gruping have <br/>\n&gt; much flows wich need corection and additional balancing like higer lv <br/>\nmages <br/>\n&gt; and wizards. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also there are too low gains from questing and one thing wich can add much<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; to game can be a god questing sistem where many diferent players must <br/>\n&gt; cooperate to reach some target but for now it is only killing stronger MOB<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and if you spend 5 hours to resolve quest and in end you dont know a right<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; word wich you hear on other side of continent you make all way back write <br/>\na <br/>\n&gt; right word on paper go back and say it only to get 1 rusty sword and 5 <br/>\n&gt; copper as a 12 lv caracter not to see any move on your experience bar it <br/>\nis <br/>\n&gt; realy bad. i do it 3 times to 3 diferent quests and as i try hardest <br/>\nthings <br/>\n&gt; what i found and after this reward i lost wish to try again. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; to be thrue it will be nice to get experience also for trading skills and <br/>\n&gt; give them more variants so a posibility to make all normal armours and <br/>\n&gt; weapons. And it will be nice to have possibility to make a dragon leather <br/>\n&gt; armour ( hint hint) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It will be nice to have some chests wich thiefs can picklock. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fishing some other things then normal fishs, or other stramge things like <br/>\n&gt; boots with a gen in bag with a surprise big fish wich will pull you in <br/>\n&gt; water and cast summon pirana swarm on you eheheeh <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It will be nice to have a place where you can leave your goods to sell and<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; where you must pass evry now and then to collect all income or it is lost <br/>\n&gt; put this place on some lost plane or limit sellers to some level range, i <br/>\n&gt; wish to buy a totem stah and all mana gain equipment but as im from europe<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and i play normaly when all servers are empty i cannot buy or sell nearly <br/>\n&gt; anything. and i play on fenin ro wich is all time full. ( hmm maybe i will<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; move from rathe mountains not too much people know where this place is <br/>\n&gt; eheheheh) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is great and wonderfull world but for now it is a little bit empty it <br/>\n&gt; needs a soul, a movement a random orc attacks on kelethim, dark elf <br/>\nrampage <br/>\n&gt; on freeport, dragon flying in sky in unknown direction, strange never seen<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; beast in dark wood to start legends. More inteligence in program to make <br/>\n&gt; world looks more diferent so that finaly a camping is not more <br/>\ninteresting. <br/>\n&gt; It is not need for human intervence it can be done by program if you leave<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; a orc camp and in zone is many players then why not that orcs group and <br/>\n&gt; start hunting around geting items from falen (eheheh at last some money so<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; bank will get some real signifikance). Other similar products will come <br/>\n&gt; soon big bad MS is preparing to enter in game on big door ( i just read a <br/>\n&gt; news on its site it will bring some interesting news) the other players <br/>\nare <br/>\n&gt; also on front door for bringing something new soon everquest will not be <br/>\n&gt; only game in 3d rpg town and if a game is not interesting enough when <br/>\n&gt; others come in play ? .... ? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S. I like this game very very much and all this critics are only in hope<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; that it will give some ideas how to make it better and that i will be <br/>\nshure <br/>\n&gt; to play it long long time as i enjoy it now.
