It is absolutely awesome! And my sister (who is a<br/>\ncomputer tech) says Micron is the best brand for RAM. Oh, and she said that<br/>\nyou&#39;re better off getting a system with Windows 2000 (not ME or XP).<br/>\nApparently Win 98 sometimes has a problem if you have more than 512Mb RAM.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I have seen the Athlon used in some nice systems. There is a nice<br/>\n&gt; shop near here that has been custom building systems for about 20<br/>\n&gt; years. I may check with them and see if they can cobble up something<br/>\n&gt; at a good price. I don&#39;t want to build it myself. Had enough of that<br/>\n&gt; back in the mid-80&#39;s. I think over the next year or so I will come up<br/>\n&gt; with a servicable solution.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have a great Holiday Season.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you are looking for a new system, I recommend you go with an AMD<br/>\n&gt; Athlon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; processor. I know they have had problems with EQ in the past but<br/>\n&gt; they cost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much less than pentiums. I used to be loyal to pentiums but even<br/>\n&gt; though my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mother has more RAM in her computer and a 1.7GHz P4, my system with<br/>\n&gt; a 1.4GHz<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AMD (both have same OS and both are HPs) runs faster. It cost $119<br/>\n&gt; for 256M<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of RAM for the P4. I&#39;d have to ask my dad how much he payed for my<br/>\n&gt; upcoming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; RAM, but for xmas he&#39;s getting me 1.2GHz of RAM. I also read some<br/>\n&gt; articles<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on building new computers and Pentiums run hotter and require<br/>\n&gt; special<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sockets and special RAM that all cost more than it costs for AMDs.<br/>\n&gt; For a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; modem, you could try a V92 Zoom. I got one for about $21 (not<br/>\n&gt; including<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shipping) online. But that&#39;s for phone line modem. Once you figure<br/>\n&gt; out what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you want, look up pricegrabber.com, epinions.com, pricewatch.com,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cnet.com. You can compare them and see which one has the lowest<br/>\n&gt; price and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; best review.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I bought my machine last year for Christmas. A gift for the<br/>\n&gt; family.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It was a mid-range system at that time, though I did not know that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the 256k memory limit would make it low-end so quickly. I added a<br/>\n&gt; 3d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; card at about six months, not knowing that the standard was moving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ahead so fast. With the knowledge I now have, I may have scraped<br/>\n&gt; up a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bit more and bought higher end, but it was not then a good<br/>\n&gt; economic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; move.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will be adding enough memory in a few weeks to bring my system<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to it&#39;s 256k max. I ordered sol in the summer, with the<br/>\n&gt; expectation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that the 128k minimum would be in place when released. I found<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my max would now be the new minimum.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As is the system is nominally playable. With the new memory and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possibly a new graphics card (fortunately the cost of a gforce 2<br/>\n&gt; has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dropped to an easily reachable level) the machine will serve. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expect Sony/V will make improvements in the game to keep lower end<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; players viable for some time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now I must plan to upgrade hardware and catch up, perhaps pull<br/>\n&gt; ahead<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the curve a bit so I am not always catching up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I am not able to scrape up the $4k bucks for a real<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kick-ass system like I see in the magazines. I will probably see<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a new tower with lots of memory, a gforce 3 and a good sized hard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; drive will cost me, and begin saving in hopes of getting it online<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before this system gets too old to play.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those of us on the lower end, we must hope Sony/V wants our<br/>\n&gt; bucks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough to keep us alive a bit longer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
