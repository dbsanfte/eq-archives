As an example, the Observer Staff is part of a quest that<br/>\nusually Level 30+ can complete. But you can also purchase the item but<br/>\nagain, I doubt a level 10 could have accumulated over 200-300 plat. I am<br/>\nnot saying it is impossible, but what I am saying is that what you have now<br/>\nis excellent and should last you until at least level 20 or 30.<br/>\n<br/>\n         As for the Sense Animal spell, you can obtain that at any Druid<br/>\nGuild. I believe the closest one to you from Halas is the Druid Guild<br/>\nat Surefall Glen, I believe that is the name of the zone. If you ever need<br/>\nany of the Animal Spells, the druids carry all those spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n         Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nFreeop Lilfoot, Halfling Druid<br/>\nTS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:46 AM 8/11/99 +0100, Nick Cooper wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Nick Cooper&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ncooper@...\">ncooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m a level 10 Shaman and have a few questions...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have had a Bloodforge Hammer and am currently use a Runed Totem Staff,<br/>\n&gt;but can anyone suggest a better melee weapon.<br/>\n&gt;And does anyone know where I can get the &#39;Sense Animal&#39; spell.
