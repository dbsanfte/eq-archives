I disagree here. You can NOT outrun them even with sow because the rygors seem to have sow already.

Once you figure out where the zone-in is, it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; really that big of a deal.  The Orcs in the fort don&#39;t see invis, so you<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t in any danger unless it drops.  And at 36 you have SoW, so even if<br/>\n&gt; invis did drop, you can outrun them to the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree here. You can NOT outrun them even with sow because the rygors<br/>\nseem to have sow already. And they stun you and hit for 150dmg or more at a<br/>\ntime. They killed my lvl 50 cleric (who had sow on) in 2 seconds while he<br/>\nwas trying to outrun them. He was full life and fully buffed at the time he<br/>\ntried to outrun them. and they took him down that fast. Don&#39;t know how many,<br/>\nbut they were all behind him. none were in front so he didnt&#39; run by any.<br/>\nThey just caught up. No noticeable lag. I have been killed several times at<br/>\nthis fort because the mobs outrun sow even when you are full life. And they<br/>\noften interrupt gate.<br/>\nBut, with camo up it is safe to enter the fort. Safer even if a group has<br/>\nkilled most of the orcs at the fort.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The ent of CC is safe.  I never saw a train when I was in there (well a<br/>\n&gt; train at the EW zone in anyway).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have seen numerous trains. the green conning orcs will aggro and gang up.<br/>\npeople train to the guards inside.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Orcs drop some nice items and velium, which is one of the components<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; making Thurg Gate potions.  The spiders at the bottom of the Caverns drop<br/>\n&gt; Crystalline silk, which is the other component.   Even with the &quot;Nexus<br/>\n&gt; porting system&quot;, the gate potions are essential, especially as you get up<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; level and start doing raids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup. Very sweet loot in CC. Also dropped are crystalline fiber, messenger of<br/>\nthe queen, ccs, and other goodies.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
