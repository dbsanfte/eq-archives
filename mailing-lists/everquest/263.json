I&#39;m pretty sure that it has to do with your computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever when someone said it has to do with IP i think they are right (well almost).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s the size that matters (umm ok ehe...)..<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe it has to do with how good your connection is between a and b. Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re on a T3 if you have a ISP between you and UUNET that connects with only V.90 or a 128 Kb frame relay.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what it transfers I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t transfer much zone info. If it would transfer everything about NPCs, PCs, your inventory and such it would be way easy to cheat. Everyone that is making an online game knows that if you allow the client to store gamingdata (such as amount of money with more) the client can pretty easy freeze the memory and add a few billion bucks (like diablo where the client told the server what kind of spells and such it had). Second point is that I have a hard time to believe that EQ goes for TCP, I think much of the traffic is UDP which would remove some lag. However the zoning traffic may be TCP to ensure the delivery, I believe the delay in zoning could be that the server tells the client to hold on (Wait while loading or what ever) and then sends zoning info to  the client. The client loads whatever the server tells it to load. The client tells the server that it&#39;s done. The server tells the client when it&#39;s time to &quot;open&quot; the zone. In clear words, I believe it depends on the latency to the server you are releasing and the new server you are connecting to. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo those who likes zoning.<br/>\nThis is like cheating to me. If you fight a monster or get attacked it would be much more fair if the monster followed you to the other zone. To zone as a &quot;get a way&quot; tactic is wimpy. I have to admit that I have done it but this is not the way I fight. This is like using safe spots to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s many believes but I just wanted to give my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nMikael Laine / MCSE<br/>\nSystem Engineer<br/>\nExide Nordic<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCheck my Terminal Server site at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://welcome.to/wts\">http://welcome.to/wts</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n-----Ursprungligt meddelande-----<br/>\nFr�n: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NYR21@...\">NYR21@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NYR21@...\">NYR21@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTill: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDatum: den 7 maj 1999 23:40<br/>\n�mne: Re: [EverQuest] zoning<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NYR21@...\">NYR21@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I connect is my isp at a halarious 21600.
