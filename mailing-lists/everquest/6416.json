Whenever you are <br>&gt; \n  low on mana, every spell fizzles. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; When in doubt, gate. \n  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; There is not a single bathroom in all of Norrath. <br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; The Armor Class of a piece of armor is inversely proportional as to \n  <br>&gt; how good it looks on you. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The item that you want \n  the most drops the rarest. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The item that you want the most \n  is out of your price range. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The item that you want the most \n  was sold at an auction while you <br>&gt; were offline. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The \n  item that you want the most was picked up by some moron who <br>&gt; didn&#39;t \n  know the definition of &quot;No Drop&quot;. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The item you&#39;ll need \n  tomorrow is No Rent. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The item you accidentally drop will be \n  the most <br>&gt; valuable/powerful/important item you carry. <br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; If you can afford it, it&#39;s not for sale. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you \n  want two of them, it&#39;s a Lore item. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you want to sell it, \n  it&#39;s a No Drop item. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The High Quality Bear Skin drops every \n  28 days, the same schedule as <br>&gt; PMS. Coincidence? <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  Even greens kill. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Backstab means never having to say you&#39;re \n  sorry. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; A bow without arrows seems awfully heavy all of a \n  sudden. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Merchants are perfectly capable of kicking tail and \n  taking names. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Trains have the right of way. <br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; If it&#39;s stupid but it works, it isn&#39;t stupid. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The \n  guards are never there when you need them. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Misuse of a \n  combine button in a hurry = highly colorful language. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The \n  time it takes to upload the newest patch is directly <br>&gt; proportional to \n  your eagerness to log on. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; No two people have ever agreed on \n  a single, precise definition of a <br>&gt; twink. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Never \n  forget that your newbie weapon was crafted by the lowest <br>&gt; bidder. \n  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; A roleplayer drinks to increase his alcohol tolerance; an \n  idiot does <br>&gt; it in the Kelethin treetops. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Having a \n  tenth of a bubble of health left is Nature&#39;s way of telling <br>&gt; you to \n  slow down. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Gnome wizards are proof positive that size does \n  not matter. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The greatest mystery in Norrath is how NPCs \n  figure out what religion <br>&gt; you are just by looking at you. <br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; Every shaman on Norrath at one point in his or her life has done the \n  <br>&gt; pig joke when someone asked for a SOW. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Only twelve \n  people in all of Norrath are truly happy with their last <br>&gt; names. \n  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The last bubble takes forever to fill. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; It \n  is somehow discouraging to realize that Qeynos is &quot;SonyEQ&quot; <br>&gt; spelled \n  backwards. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  <br><br><br>&quot;Sometimes, just sometimes, you dream too hard....and everything \n  shatters... there&#39;s nothing left to do but pick up the pieces and go \n  on...hoping time will be kind enough to heal your wounds.&quot; <br><br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.msn.com/mistayakiara/\">http://groups.msn.com/mistayakiara/</a><br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/mistayakiara/\">http://www.livejournal.com/users/mistayakiara/</a><br><br>&quot;Never \n  stop believing that, if nothing else, things change, and evolve into the \n  light, and all chaos will cease.
