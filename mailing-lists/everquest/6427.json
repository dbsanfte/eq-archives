I have 1gb ram, with an amd processor ( running win 2000 ) lol i was cheap, but it works. However I am on dialup, as there isnt anything faster or better in my area yet, tho i hear wi-fi is coming so....&lt;crossing fingers&gt;. The huige wait tho, sometimes longer than the actual loading, is zoning into PoK. It is is horribley long wait...worse if the character i want to play is camped there...so until there is a change..I seldom go there now ort camp there. I have a pocket cleric and chanter to temp/ virtue and kei, me in nexus, so al is good.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Tho I do have an issue with PoK..am I the only one that has to run around PoK loking at their feet and suing the map so not to run into stuff? The lag there, most times ( early morn seems to be best) is very bad...<br><br><b><i>&quot;Steven R.
