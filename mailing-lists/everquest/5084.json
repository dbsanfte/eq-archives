Like you, I have soloed most of <br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; life.  What I have found about LDoN is, true you have to group.  <br/>\nBut<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the organization is there, so that the groups constantly change.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Most often I am asked to join by putting my LFG flag up.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; adventures are short, 2 hrs and have a specific goal to obtain.  <br/>\nThe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exp is great, typically half a level per adventure.  We druids are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; popular for our regen buff and healing, and have counteract <br/>\npoison up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if someone&#39;s gonna play with the crates.  You can save yourself in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time if your fast.  Then, after 2 hrs, you split the loot, <br/>\ntypically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 50 - 80 plat your share, and go back to soloing.  I thought it was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more for guilds as well, but have yet to see a group of all one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild.  I am typically quiet (I type slow, hehe) but so much goes <br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so fast, that nobody seems to mind.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tokool Espirit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lany&#39;s server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   From: mlockridge01<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2003 1:03 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Hello All<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I am a lvl 41 Halfling Druid.
