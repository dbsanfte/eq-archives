Ram and a nice<br/>\n&gt; video card and everything works a lot smoother. CPU power isnt that<br/>\n&gt; important.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 512mb for $100 isnt steep. And your machine needs to be nicely configured.<br/>\n&gt; For example if you run WinXP old world eq and me would be like 256 megs to<br/>\n&gt; run ok but on 98 128 works ok and 160 is fine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And dont be so negative, SoL is a whopping expansion worth the new specs.<br/>\n&gt; Graphics are cool (some char models are a bit weird) but mobs/surrondings<br/>\n&gt; are very nice.
