For quite some time I bugged NPC&#39;s with absolutely no result<br/>\nother than bringing my skill up to (4).  My husband, also curious as<br/>\nto how quickly one could improve (and probably to not be outdone by a<br/>\ngirl in whatever ability) also played around with it tonight.  When<br/>\nall of the sudden a guard, *not* the one he had targeted and was<br/>\n&quot;begging&quot; from, came up and killed him.  We&#39;ve looked at the text log<br/>\nand he didn&#39;t *do* anything to warrant this reaction, his faction is<br/>\nexcellent (in Kelethin).  Any ideas?  Can you irritate these folks to<br/>\nthe point that they&#39;d as soon kill you as give you a copper?  Or<br/>\nshould I report it as a bug?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nLliani of Kelethin<br/>\nKarana server<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
