I find the durability idea interesting. It would add to the player<br/>\neconomy if someone could specialize in its repair.. and I&#39;m sure you will<br/>\nfind many a player that would want to study these arts.  I definitely agree<br/>\nthat something has to be done to increase the value of money.  What I find<br/>\nin today&#39;s EQ world are campers that are trading to other campers.. forcing<br/>\nevery other player to then in turn become campers themselves..  This in<br/>\ncombination with the fact that only jewelers actually need cash, gems etc.<br/>\npurchased from merchants, if your not in the market for enchanted jewelry<br/>\nthen your cash is worthless.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that they have created these new class specific rubi replacements, they<br/>\nhave at least attempted to change that.  Example.. Being a ranger myself, in<br/>\norder to complete my quest for the Ivy bracer I have to purchase a stone<br/>\nvalued at 120p.. then another for a second bracer. It does add to the<br/>\neconomy a bit but.. the problem is the money I spend is not going back into<br/>\nthe general population... its going to the merchants.. ack :(.<br/>\n<br/>\nDurability is an interesting idea sounds plausible to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  As for the idea of horses and the such.. I once thought this was a great<br/>\nidea; however, the EQ world as it is.. Is just to small for such modes of<br/>\ntransport. Now if they could increase that land mass abit and make zones<br/>\nmuch larger, as in AC then I might agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Binds in the city without going to casters for help.  Sounds good when<br/>\nyou first hear it; however I kinda like the idea of somehow supplying newbie<br/>\ncasters some income.  I remember really hurting for cash with one of my mage<br/>\ncharacters.  In the beginning spells cost a ton to the average newbie.  I<br/>\nlike it the way it is.  The one thing I want?  My ranger would have the<br/>\nability to gate.. I know that a ring does exist,&quot;Glimmer Ring&quot;, which allows<br/>\nme to gate.. only thing is, it works once.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Rubi, Rubi, Rubi,  personally I hate rubi.. hehe...  I think its<br/>\nwonderful that they have added additional sets of armor, plus the fact its<br/>\nclass specific.  It would be a truly boring place if everyone was decked out<br/>\nin all red.  I have to say the newly created no drop item quest for class<br/>\nspecific armor, was a godsend.  Lets look at the pluses:<br/>\n<br/>\na.  Armor tailored for a class with stats helping to further balance the<br/>\nclasses overall.<br/>\n<br/>\nb.  Items for quest are no drop, therefore if you want the armor you pretty<br/>\nmuch have to loot the items yourself. This minimizes the camping by casters<br/>\nwho are in it just for the money.  I hate having to lower myself to<br/>\ntrade/buy an item from some caster, that could never use it to being with,<br/>\nwhom probably KS&#39;d it from someone who really needed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nc.  Quest items are also spread out across the entire world forcing players<br/>\nto move about the zones.<br/>\n<br/>\nd.  Each armor piece requires the actual spending of money, ill be it to the<br/>\nmerchants :(, and this is good to increase the overall value of the<br/>\nplatinum.<br/>\n<br/>\ne.  The quest are, from what I have experienced, quite sufficiently<br/>\ndifficult.  When teamed with a nice group they can be completed, however if<br/>\nyou want to solo you better be ready to dish it out.. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall nice suggestions, and these are just my thoughts on the matter..<br/>\n<br/>\n:)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
