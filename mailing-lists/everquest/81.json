I live in sweden and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; preordered the game about one week before the end of beta phase 4, now I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have ordered it from 4 places both domestic(one being the largest comp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game distributor in sweden) and foreign. But I still haven&#39;t received the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game. Now I am active reader on eqvault as well as participate in mailing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lists, and this is REALLY annoying. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve had some extra<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time thinking about what class/race I will play.. And if I don&#39;t get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game within 2 weeks from now I&#39;m gonna give up and buy Ultima or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something, but then again, I would have to kill myself.. :p<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Avron - Totally BUMMED right now! :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just carry on, bummed guy.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s worth it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Corydon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Start a new hobby.
