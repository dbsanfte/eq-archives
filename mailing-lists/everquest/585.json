There is a way to prevent &quot;twinking&quot; and still have the items availible for trade, an alternative to NO DROP. Put level blocks on equipment, meaning you cannot use/wear the equipment until you are high enough level for the item, the level will be somewhere below the level you need to get it.\r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nPossible answers are:<br/>\n<br/>\no NO DROP is the way to go.<br/>\no Hmm, level caps on items, that&#39;s better..<br/>\no Why not both at once?<br/>\n                      <br/>\n<br/>\nTo vote, please visit the following web page:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/surveycenter/EverQuest\">http://www.onelist.com/surveycenter/EverQuest</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNote: Please do not reply to this message.
