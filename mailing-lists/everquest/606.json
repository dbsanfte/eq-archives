You should be able to store such items in your bank until the time in which you have proven the ability to use such items.  They already have a form of this now.  Some weapons, which have a magical effect, will not cast its spell until the bearer has achieved a certain level.  If you wish to make the game a tad bit closer to reality how could you expect a low level squire to have the ability to skillfully use the same weapon as someone who has achieved the Master skill level for 2H slash. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lance </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
