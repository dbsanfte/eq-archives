I am using <br/>\nXP. I called Sony and was on the phone with them for 20 minutes until <br/>\nthey found out I have a laptop, then they said they couldn&#39;t help me :<br/>\n( I posted the error on the Allakhazam site (with all the info on my <br/>\neqclient.ini and dxdialog files) and they didn&#39;t help. Someone on the <br/>\nEverquest chat channel told me to delete my eqclient.ini file, which <br/>\ndidn&#39;t help either. I ended up using my system restore, and restored <br/>\nthe system to the day before I started getting the eqgame.exe error <br/>\nand it has been working fine ever since. Good luck to you, hope you <br/>\nget it going soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have an idea as to why Sony won&#39;t support me because I <br/>\nuse a laptop?<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lady_of_onlinegames&quot; <br/>\n&lt;lady_1980_93446@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I get to the servers and then it starts to go but then a box comes <br/>\n </span></blockquote>up <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and says eqgame.exe encountered a problem and needs to close.<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else having this problem and do you know what to do about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it?  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; can someone assist me please?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
