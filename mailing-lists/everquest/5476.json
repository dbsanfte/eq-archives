Like \n  others I enjoyed reading about your early exploits, and now reading about what \n  others went thru is so cool.&nbsp; I started with a wizzard.....which wasn&#39;t \n  the best choice for a first time player.&nbsp; But I read the Lord of the \n  Rings, and Gandolph is powerfull, sooo I chose a wizzard.&nbsp; I came up in \n  freeport and immeaditly got lost.&nbsp; Then I ran out of food and drink, they \n  didn&#39;t start you with much back then.&nbsp; I never saw a McDonnald&#39;s or a \n  Safeway, and I&#39;m dying from starvation.&nbsp; I asked another player where to \n  find food, and he said just let your character die and you&#39;ll get more, I was \n  horrified.&nbsp; I too had to ask how to open doors....tried saying open \n  sesimee, didn&#39;t work.&nbsp; But when I tried to hail an orc, he killed me, and \n  food problem was solved, temporarly.&nbsp; Then I ran the wrong way and \n  the&nbsp;game froze for a few seconds, then it said I was in East \n  Commonlands.&nbsp; By that point, I was so frustrated that I allmost \n  quit.&nbsp; But then I attacked a skelli and won, I was sooo proud of that \n  kill.&nbsp; </div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div>The point of all this is we all went thru what you are now.&nbsp; And \n  there is no totally right or wrong way to play, because you can&#39;t possibly \n  accomplish all there is in the game.&nbsp; We have all made mistakes, and \n  there are ways to correct them later.&nbsp; The main thing is to have \n  fun.&nbsp; So somebody power levels you a bit.....enjoy it, it&#39;s another \n  experience in the game.&nbsp; And if you attack a willowisp without a magical \n  weapon.....well, join the club.&nbsp; I think we all made that mistake at \n  least once.&nbsp; You will have times that everything goes wrong, and other \n  times it all goes right.....just like real life.&nbsp; That&#39;s what makes this \n  game so much fun, &nbsp;&nbsp;and before you know it, you&#39;ll be telling a \n  newbie about the letter you lost, and laughing about how much you didn&#39;t know \n  &quot;way back then&quot;.&nbsp; Some players are mean and cruel, so be carefull, but \n  most are friendly and willing to help you when things get &quot;impossible&quot;.&nbsp; \n  When you are lost, most will help you find your way.&nbsp; Just like this \n  &quot;e-loop&quot; many are trying to help you now.</div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div>So, relax, and enjoy, and tell us more.....you write very well and it&#39;s a \n  pleasure to read what you have to say.&nbsp;

I&#39;m one<br>of <br>those newbies.&nbsp; Started \n    about three weeks ago, role playing as <br>Qaidyanye, (still a 1st level \n    High Elf-Paly) on the Brell Serilis <br>server.<br><br>I have been trying to \n    learn as much as possible from my basic EQ <br>Gold manual, a set of the \n    Prima Players Guides a couple of sites <br>online and this loop.&nbsp; I \n    absolutely love to read about EQ play.&nbsp; I <br>can only get on for one \n    extended play and a couple of shorter <br>sessions a week though, so don&#39;t \n    have a lot of intense time online.<br><br>(1) I wanted to roleplay and not \n    use any of what is called the <br>power leveling ...but I&#39;m so \n    unknowledgeable, I think I have <br>accidentally...?&nbsp; I found a small \n    mail quest and was talking to a <br>really high level (59 or so) SK, who for \n    whatever reason deemed to <br>group me and told me to get on \n    auto-follow.&nbsp; She got me from <br>Felwithe to the orc lift at \n    Kelethin.&nbsp; So cool when you&#39;re new.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Anyhow, up the lift \n    I went.&nbsp; I found the Bard&#39;s Guild Hall, however, <br>when I went to \n    deliver the &#39;letter&#39; --- it was no longer in my <br>inventory...I am certain \n    it was given to me from an NPC character <br>(Tissleplay.&nbsp; Its not like \n    I have a lot in inventory yet as you know <br>with newbies, but the `letter&#39; \n    was gone when I went to &#39;give&#39;<br>it to <br>the Bard.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I \n    wandered around the treetops for awhile.&nbsp; I spoke <br>to a few players, \n    but found nothing to do and was trying to figure <br>out how I could get \n    back through the forest to Felwithe to do my <br>basic training \n    points.&nbsp; As I was walking around through the tree <br>platforms, from \n    my back came an attack by an orc something or <br>other...after he struck me \n    the first time I ran to a guard nearby, <br>but the orc thingy killed me and \n    the guard.&nbsp; So I &#39;came back&#39; at the <br>entrance to Greater Faydark I \n    think.<br><br>Very soon after I started walking, a character began talking \n    with <br>me, and I talked with him for awhile.&nbsp; He said he was a level \n    six, <br>he was bald looking and had a green robe of some type on.&nbsp; He \n    wanted <br>to &#39;group&#39;, and we went along towards the town center.&nbsp; He \n    told me <br>about swimming and I tried that.<br>Then he told me let&#39;s \n    meditate, after sitting for awhile, I went <br>over to try and talk with an \n    NPC for fishing supplies, when I came <br>back this group leader guy \n    Summader) was dead.&nbsp; He didn&#39;t come back <br>very quickly, so I went \n    along.&nbsp; I found some quest that said if I <br>collected the bone chips \n    of four skeletons I would be &#39;richly <br>rewarded.&#39;&nbsp; So I went to the \n    outside of Faydark, and Summader was <br>there again.&nbsp; I told him of my \n    quest and he said let&#39;s go...he had <br>some sorts of magic spells and used \n    them on a couple of skeletons, <br>and motioned for me to pick up the \n    loot.&nbsp; Which I think I did.&nbsp; Then <br>this Summader \n    disappeared.&nbsp; Here I am, level one, innocent little <br>Paly, \n    drakelings, flying bats, skeletons...twinkling twinks or <br>something like \n    that all around me...no path in sight.&nbsp; I start <br>running; suddenly I \n    see a path, and on the other side what looks <br>like a stanchion with a \n    book on top of it.&nbsp; I went over and clicked, <br>thinking it was some \n    sort of clue etc....and it says &#39;loading&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>(2)&nbsp; Then \n    suddenly I am somewhere else...(I have EQ Gold edition <br>which includes \n    Everquest Classic, Ruins of Kunark, Shadows of <br>Luclin, Scars of Velious \n    and Planes of Power.)---so did I &#39;power up <br>somewhere?&quot;&nbsp; Or was this \n    just some sort of portal?&nbsp; Open ground area <br>with mostly one story \n    Grecian architecture type buildings...quite a <br>lot of different races \n    running about. Text is scrolling by fast on <br>my main window, most of \n    which is peppered with abbreviations I <br>cannot figure out of course \n    :o)....I turned one corner, and then it <br>looks like a big party...at \n    least 15 or 20 characters, different <br>races/species, all slinging magic \n    of some sort or practicing or ?&nbsp; <br>I, irl, was at that a little fried \n    from this log-on and all the <br>activity and not having any inkling where I \n    am, or what is going <br>on.&nbsp; I could find hardly anyone who would \n    speak with mea very<br>busy <br>place! Finally, a gallant, (sweet) \n    manly-man :0), took a minute to <br>walk me over to some sort of vertically \n    designed stone and I got <br>back to Greater Faydark and then camped.&nbsp; \n    And so that is my <br>(probably quite boring) saga.&nbsp; <br><br>When I \n    went online the next time, a most helpful Cleric struck up a \n    <br>conversation with me.&nbsp; She was very generous with gifts and her \n    <br>time.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, I kept getting disconnected 1001 errors.) \n    She <br>said she gave to me three items  I think leather legging, a \n    vest<br>or <br>jacket of some sort, and something else.&nbsp; She also gave \n    me 107 <br>plat.&nbsp; The plat showed up on my inventory screen; but I \n    can&#39;t<br>find <br>the gifts.&nbsp; She kept trying to tell me to look in my \n    backpack as I <br>don&#39;t have any bags yet.&nbsp; I have scoured my manual \n    and<br>guidesI <br>click on my backpack and see the image of the \n    backpackbut I<br>don&#39;t <br>know how to `open&#39; it or access the \n    contents.&nbsp; So I found a<br>bank and <br>put my money in, and went out \n    happily hunting truth and injustice as <br>only a powerful 1st level Paly \n    can doand I actually killed<br>several <br>rodents AND a spiderlingAND \n    attacked a skeleton-looking<br>thing,<br>ding,I got promoted, now evil \n    Norrath residents are cowering as I <br>practice my hunting prowess as a \n    Level 2 High Elf Paly<br><br>Now what?!&nbsp; I thought I would try to get \n    some info before going back <br>on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love this, but have \n    absolutely no one irl who is the least <br>bit interested in any sort of \n    roleplaying type game...or knows <br>anything about EQ.<br><br>In one of the \n    last EQ digests I read, Flaumigevylke said:<br>&quot;... But I have to say as \n    well that there&#39;s characters from every <br>class I&#39;ve played with have done \n    the same thing, they don&#39;t know how <br>to play and end up getting the whole \n    group wiped out. Personally I <br>blame it on them being power leveled and \n    not taking the time to <br>learn how to really play them or know what their \n    full capabilities <br>are.&quot;<br><br><br>It would be so helpful to all of the \n    newbies reading this, if you <br>vet&#39;s would give us a general overview of \n    the most beneficial trek <br>toward being a good supportive player by the \n    time we are at higher <br>levels.&nbsp; I know skills and training is \n    somewhat different dependent <br>upon the race and class.&nbsp; I would love \n    some personal guidance on how <br>to become a rock solid Paly!&nbsp; But, \n    general pointers are also helpful <br>to beginners.&nbsp; There is a HUGE \n    amount of information. Like, I&#39;ve <br>read in all my guides, if you are a \n    level below 10 or so, you should <br>practice or train your skills any \n    chance you get; and also not to <br>venture much past where a guard is, that \n    you shouldn&#39;t try to kill <br>even the smaller mobs if there are multiples, \n    etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; --- so how do I <br>move up in levels?&nbsp; I have no \n    inkling yet, how to strategize.&nbsp; I <br>know what my main inventory \n    window is, but when I have killed <br>something and loot it, a different \n    window pops up...does everything <br>I loot go automatically to my main \n    inventory window, or am I suppose <br>to access some other sort of window to \n    see the items I am obtaining <br>towards a quest I am on? Some character \n    said he gave me a &#39;buff&#39; and <br>for me to go fight something---that the \n    buff would be good for two <br>hours.&nbsp; But how do I confirm something \n    like this; what window do I <br>go to in order to see what sort of magical \n    help he gave me?&nbsp; <br><br>I swear never to write more than a two \n    paragraph post again, pls <br>don&#39;t kick me off the list for taking up too \n    much space and time!&nbsp; <br>Thanks a lot, <br><br>Sign me:<br>Hoping for \n    a lot of help now, so that a few seasons from now I won&#39;t <br>sound so \n    pathetic and I can later help someone else...<br>Q on Brell \n    Serilis<br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br><tt>\n    <hr width=\"500\">\n    <b>Yahoo!
