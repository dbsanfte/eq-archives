I generally just did kiting where <br/>\nit seemed to work well, such as sk. Lots of room. Kept picking up too <br/>\nmany Aviaks as I was running around, so I have switched to root/dot. <br/>\nI don&#39;t generally intentionally hunt more than one mob at a time, but <br/>\nhave had to deal with two on occasion when my target gets some <br/>\nunexpected help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI even started hunting light-blues lately, because I can kill three <br/>\nlight blues in the time it takes me to kill a dark blue. With Aviaks, <br/>\nRooks tend to have loot equal in value to Harriers and Avocets, so if <br/>\nI kill three rooks in the same amount of time it would take me to <br/>\nkill an Avocet and then recover, I get more loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously I am not into leveling quickly. Indeed, I try to enjoy each <br/>\nlevel as much as possible, working on getting funds for future spells <br/>\nand items, hunting interesting mobs, and advancing trade skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust moved to Everfrost last night. Plan to do Wooly Mammoths and <br/>\nstart poking around a bit in Permafrost. Some good items in <br/>\nPermafrost.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Biltilie Dwimmerlaik &lt;biltilie@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Thomas H.

Since you have done it, could you explain?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; my quadding knowledge is based on a french wizzy only site, and a <br/>\nfew<br/>\n&gt; attemtps with my wizzy (she is 40 and levelled w/o kiting most of <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; time). before i explain the basic idea, let me add this: quadding <br/>\nisn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; very welcome by other players, especially in zones with many hunting<br/>\n&gt; people. IMHO this is a technique to be done in off hours (getting <br/>\nharder<br/>\n&gt; because those times maybe main times for other players). also i <br/>\nhave to<br/>\n&gt; add, if some quadder endangers my party or me, or just annoys other<br/>\n&gt; people in the zone, i nuke away her/his tail - without any friendly<br/>\n&gt; warning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ok, the basic idea is to maximise experience per time. you need two<br/>\n&gt; things for that: (1) a slow spell and (2) area damage spells. it is<br/>\n&gt; good for (1) to have an area version of this as well. what i also<br/>\n&gt; recommend is some knowledge of the zone you want to kite in, because<br/>\n&gt; if the zone has some weird pathing, or you can get other adds, you<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t have much fun doing it. two additional things make it somewhat<br/>\n&gt; easier: (a) something to make you run faster, eg sow, jboots, horse<br/>\n&gt; and (b) candy of course, because many of those area damage spells<br/>\n&gt; need some amounts of mana.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; because of (1), (2) and (a) it is easiest for druids because of <br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; normal spells. wizzies either need jboots or sow potions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; an additional nice-to-have-thing for wizzies, is anice stick <br/>\nobtained<br/>\n&gt; through a quest in the ro-temple: Staff of Temperate Flux. no you <br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; need it for fighting, but it has a very nice effect: Lower Element.<br/>\n&gt; this effect has almost the same range as the damage spells you use <br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; kiting/quadding!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; so, how does it actually work:<br/>\n&gt;   - tag monster(s) with a slow spell up to four<br/>\n&gt;   - group them if necessary - you need them close for your area <br/>\nspells<br/>\n&gt;     to work<br/>\n&gt;   - keep moving and area damaging them, until all of them fall apart<br/>\n&gt;   - don&#39;t get killed yourself<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; why didn&#39;t i mention the names of the used spells, because druids <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; wizzies use a different set: druids do their &quot;illness and rotting&quot;<br/>\n&gt; spells, and wizzies use their normal raw forces ones.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a sidenote for wizzies: you need your lvl 29 &quot;Bonds of Force&quot; for <br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; task, but this one has a special feature (i don&#39;t know if druids do <br/>\nrun<br/>\n&gt; into the same problem): you can snare yourself with this spell, if <br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; cast it on a mob being too close !!! yes, i knew of this feature, <br/>\nand i<br/>\n&gt; snared myself on the first attempts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i am not sure if other classes can do this as well, or if it is <br/>\npossible<br/>\n&gt; to do reverse quadding (using fear), but this sounds very uncommon,<br/>\n&gt; because i don&#39;t think you can force a group of critters in one <br/>\ndirection<br/>\n&gt; using fear. maybe also some of the druids on this board will give <br/>\naway<br/>\n&gt; some of the tricks of the trade ... :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; before i stop, i want to remind you again: people are playing EQ <br/>\nfor fun<br/>\n&gt; and want to enjoy it. and you can easily spoil someones day even if <br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; have fun ... think about it !<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; take care<br/>\n&gt; Biltilie Dwimmerlaik<br/>\n&gt; level 52 female gnome magician (run over by brownie guards)<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
