Just wondering if anyone had any suggestions<br/>\nfor gear I can get her. I totally dont want to do the newbie gear quests if<br/>\nI can help it. I&#39;d rather go out and buy some inexpensive armor.  Got a<br/>\ndecent robe for now, but at level 10 she&#39;s wearing nothing else but cloth<br/>\nand the summoned focus items. Got any suggestions? (sniff... I&#39;m so used to<br/>\ntwinking my alts I forgot what it&#39;s like to work for your stuff hehe)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
