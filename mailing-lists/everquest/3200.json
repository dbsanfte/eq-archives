I have been playing EQ since<br/>\n  about Nov of last year and have become adicted to it<br/>\n  just like everyone else.  I have also been a member of<br/>\n  this group for awhile but never posted.  Have enjoyed<br/>\n  alot of the info that has been put out there.  So I<br/>\n  figured it was time for me to come out of the shadows<br/>\n  and let my voice be heard.  I been play on Brell,<br/>\n  haven&#39;t tried any other servers as of yet.  Have alot<br/>\n  of friend on Brell in RL so tis why I stayed on there<br/>\n  for this long.  However I do have alittle bit of a<br/>\n  question that I want to put out there.  I play a 36<br/>\n  Drunken Chanter of Greenhall, am alittle tired of the<br/>\n  Kunark area and looking for some new places to hunt.<br/>\n  EIther in groups or solo makes me no matter.  But I<br/>\n  would like to find a place that i can do both.  And<br/>\n  yes this chanter still solos alot.  Although my guild<br/>\n  leader doesn&#39;t like it, and she has even taken away my<br/>\n  staff so that I couldn&#39;t be a chanter tank anymore.<br/>\n  hehe  What she doesn&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt me.  hehe<br/>\n  Anyway, did alot of time in LOIO and FM and OT<br/>\n  already.  To break it up I even went to SK and soloed<br/>\n  the gnolls at the spires.  But now that I am 36 SK<br/>\n  just won&#39;t do it much for now.  I do have a score to<br/>\n  settle with some giants in the Karanas though.  SO I<br/>\n  will be back.  But if anyone could shed alittle light<br/>\n  on some good places to group or solo til into the 40s,<br/>\n  with good xp.  Not saying I want to lvl every night in<br/>\n  one setting, those places would tend to be full of<br/>\n  death also.  Just looking for some nice and calm pace,<br/>\n  but have alittle on the edge feel to it.  I get enough<br/>\n  of that on raids.  And yes I do go on bigger guild<br/>\n  raids then my lvl should let me, but then again I have<br/>\n  the safety of my guild and some of our allies there.<br/>\n  So if anyone is on Brell and wants to give me a shout<br/>\n  out feel free.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Zindi<br/>\n  36 Drunken Chanter<br/>\n  Elder board for Guardians of Greenhall<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________<br/>\n  Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Sign up for SBC Yahoo!
