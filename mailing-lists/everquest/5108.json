I have 5 on a single connection, myself. One is directly connected to<br/>\nthe DSL, and runs a program called Sygate which shares the connection to the<br/>\nother machines. It has a special configuration package for EQ, but worked<br/>\nfine without it, for me, so try working without it first. If you have any<br/>\ntrouble with it, email me, it has a few rare but known issues that can be<br/>\nhard to diagnose but are pretty easy to fix.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: STG2 Pierce &lt;piercer@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;EverQuest@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 29, 2003 1:18 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Computer Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello everyone I have question for you guys.
