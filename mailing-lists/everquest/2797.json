I have thought \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; about it a bit. We \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; pay less than $200 a year just to play. Not bad. I \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; spent at least \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; $500 on GamesWorkshop products each year when I was \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; more active \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; there. \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have a problem dropping the monthly fee. It \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; is quite \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; reasonable. I might be able to dump another $500 a \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; year into \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; upgrades. Unfortunately, my machine is now pretty \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; much maxed. So I \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; must hope that I can hold out at the present level \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; long enough to get \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; together the funds for a more upgradeable tower. \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; How much are others willing to pay to play? \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;__________________________________________________ \n<div></div>&gt;Do You Yahoo!? \n<div></div>&gt;Yahoo!
