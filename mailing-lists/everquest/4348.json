I needed to right click <br/>\non Fehril to pull up a training screen that I didn&#39;t even know to <br/>\nlook for. I&#39;ll be right clicking on npcs now. I&#39;ve upped my single <br/>\nand and double hand blunt weapon skills. I was trying to drop my <br/>\nclub into a hand slot instead of an equiped weapon slot. Thanks to <br/>\neveryone for their help. I&#39;m heading back to the crater now. I have <br/>\nsome revenge to catch up on. Rock hoppers and skeletons prepare to <br/>\nmeet your doom! I&#39;m kind of getting into this. G<br/>\n<br/>\nEdward</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
