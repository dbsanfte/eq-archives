He&#39;s a blue alien with reddish brown hair. It got me thinking...<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t it be cool to have dark elves with different color hair? and then<br/>\nan idea hit me: Dark Elf / Wood Elf hybrids! (aka Dark Wood Elves or DWE).<br/>\nThey would be blue with any color hair. Have skills like ultravision,<br/>\nforage, hide, and sneak. They could be good, evil, or neutral. They could be<br/>\nbards or rangers-- maybe a new class called trackers since I think a race<br/>\nwith ultravision would be a good at tracking (someone the other night was<br/>\ncomplaining that none of the dark races have tracking skill). Regardless of<br/>\nclass, most other races would con apprehensive or dubious to them initially<br/>\nbc of their odd looks. Maybe they could be on a new island in the OOT that<br/>\ncan be reached by boat from Butcherblock (like Kunark) and Freeport. Or they<br/>\ncould be on Antonica somewhere near Neriak. The history of their race would<br/>\nbe that they are the results of the children of Dark Elves and their Wood<br/>\nElf slaves/prisoners.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been trying to get Verant to pay attention to this idea. it could be in<br/>\nan &quot;Elven Madness Expansion Pack&quot; or something...<br/>\nWhat do you think?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
