Rude people<br/>\ndrive me up the wall as well but I don&#39;t see what is so rude about &quot;Can I<br/>\nget a SoW?&quot;.  Maybe its just me, don&#39;t know.  I usually ask with something<br/>\nlike &quot;May I have sow, if your too busy its np at all.&quot;  That&#39;s almost<br/>\nverbatim of how I ask for any kind of buff.  If they say they are too busy<br/>\nor whatever I usually respond with something like &quot;Np, have a good day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for the people who are truly rude and obnoxious to me I just type<br/>\n/ignore xxxxxx, true once in a while I will have to delete my eqoptions file<br/>\nfrom time to time to make room for new jerks (this does clear your friends<br/>\nlist btw).  However I don&#39;t always ignore them right away, I can type sort<br/>\nof quick so sometimes I will bicker with them back in forth in tells for a<br/>\nwhile then ignore them, I really enjoy a good argument.  : )  When I play my<br/>\nfriends druid from time to time I will sow most anyone that asks but HP<br/>\nbuffs TP&#39;s, Regen, Shield ect ect I will not unless its mem&#39;d and I have<br/>\nextra mana I mean some of those spells are quite a bit of mana and to SLN<br/>\neveryone that asks or regen can quite frankly become quite absurd.  Just<br/>\ntell them no, if they don&#39;t understand, do you really care what they think?<br/>\nI know that I don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts such a pain for me too because I have to un-memorize spells to buff<br/>\nplayers under lvl 44 for most of the new spells I have so it gets very<br/>\nannoying for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nStranger: (notice I don&#39;t call him beggar, because I ask for buffs too from<br/>\ntime to time)&quot;If you are not busy can you buff me and my friend?&quot; (usually<br/>\nnot this nice, =P)<br/>\nTeenimu:  Surely, np.<br/>\n/w stranger<br/>\nStranger(anon)<br/>\n/g errrrr<br/>\nCon stranger<br/>\nGreen<br/>\nRight click spell slot one<br/>\n/book 50<br/>\nBeginning to memorize clarity<br/>\nect ect ect you can see where this could get very annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I have gone way off topic but I will use this time to complain about<br/>\nsomething that bothers me.  I show up in Cobalt Scar after trying for an<br/>\nhour or so to get a group up in Skyshrine that has some nads to go and kill<br/>\nsome of the Statues and Named Wryvns, but nobody will go.  So, I zone into<br/>\nCobalt Scar /w and see there are about 15 or so people here something like<br/>\nthat should be able to get a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n/lfg on<br/>\n/ooc 55 Enchanter looking for group or partner<br/>\n<br/>\nIn comes about 5 or 6 tells asking for clarity haste ect ect. But I ignore<br/>\nthem for the time being and /ooc again for a group and a few more tells come<br/>\nin for buffs again so I start responding saying I&#39;d like to group with you<br/>\nif possible hoping to get some exp.  Most of them respond with something<br/>\nalong the lines of sorry I am soloing I don&#39;t think you could really help<br/>\nmuch anyways I do fine soloing.  Errrr well you will do fine without<br/>\nclarity.  Well I endure the /poke and all the other emotes that people do to<br/>\nbeg for buffs from people that couldn&#39;t help in their group, blah blah blah.<br/>\nFinally find two rangers to group with and finally got some really good exp<br/>\nfear kitting was a lot of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways rambled long enough, so in closing just put them on ignore.  lol<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n55 Enchanter<br/>\nTunare Server<br/>\n<br/>\nSistily <br/>\n55 Warrior<br/>\nTunare Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nymue Ce&#39;Nedra [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nymue_uberdruid@...\">nymue_uberdruid@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 29, 2001 11:07 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Question for you druids out there ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure this thread has been beaten to death here but<br/>\nI&#39;m going to ask it anyway cuz I&#39;m new to the list :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 47 druid on Cazic-Thule and, like many of<br/>\nyou, I get *very* tired of being begged for SoW,<br/>\nports, HP buffs, etc. Also like many of you, I SoW,<br/>\nbuff, and port newbies and friendly people for free<br/>\nwhenever I can. I hand out nice weapons and decent<br/>\narmor to newbies like they&#39;re candy, and I genuinely<br/>\nenjoy helping people (That&#39;s a big reason I chose a<br/>\ndruid as my main).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, like almost all druids, I have times when<br/>\nnewbies and/or experienced players come up to me and<br/>\nask for things without saying please or when I&#39;m very<br/>\nbusy (like for instance the cleric just left the<br/>\ngroup, we haven&#39;t found another healer, my heals blow,<br/>\nbut I am the primary healer until another is located).<br/>\nI have a standard hotkey set up for those who ask for<br/>\nSoW or whatever rudely (the &quot;Can I get a SoW&quot; irks me<br/>\nno end): <br/>\n<br/>\nBeggar: Can I get a SoW?<br/>\nNymue: I&#39;m sorry, I do not comply with rude requests.<br/>\nNymue: Have a nice day!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does not work. They hang around begging, saying<br/>\nplease, and so on and so forth. One guy told me today,<br/>\n&quot;Damn druids ruin the game.&quot; Lovely.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my poll today is to collect people&#39;s favorite ways<br/>\nof denying requests when they don&#39;t want to/don&#39;t have<br/>\nthe time/are in a group/don&#39;t feel like complying. If<br/>\nanyone has an amusing, polite, or snotty reply to<br/>\nshare with me I&#39;d love to hear it - I&#39;m going to set<br/>\nmy favorites up as hotkeys, so please don&#39;t share it<br/>\nunless you don&#39;t mind me copying it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s assistance,<br/>\nNymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br/>\nLvl 47 Wood Elf Druid<br/>\nCazic-Thule Server <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nNymue Ce&#39;Nedra<br/>\nWood Elf Druid, Cazic-Thule Server<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
