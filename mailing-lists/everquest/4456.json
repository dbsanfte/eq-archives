I left this<br/>\n&gt; group once before because of idiotic members who insisted on forcing<br/>\n&gt; their opinions apon others, and I will not put up with it. I have<br/>\n&gt; better things to do with my time then spend it with opinionated low<br/>\n&gt; lifes. Su, I&#39;m sorry for everything, none of this goes to you, I know<br/>\n&gt; you tired, but there are just too many morons to filter out of the<br/>\n&gt; group. To the rest of you, you will never get anywhere in life with<br/>\n&gt; the attitudes you have. Only in a fantasy game like EverQuest will<br/>\n&gt; you ever be something. But at some point you need to grow up and face<br/>\n&gt; reality, and it&#39;s not going to be fun or easy when you do. Do not<br/>\n&gt; bother replying to this post. Leave your fights and comments out of<br/>\n&gt; Su&#39;s group and for once in your life respect her wishes and be<br/>\n&gt; CONSIDERATE. If you forgot what that word means, get a dictionary. If<br/>\n&gt; you MUST comment, e-mail me personally, but I most likely will just<br/>\n&gt; delete the message. Like I said, I have better things to do.
