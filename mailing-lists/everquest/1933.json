When I was in Kunark I bound myself at the mill and<br/>\noccassionally would self-port to EC to buy stuff from Freeport. I even made<br/>\nspecial trips to pick stuff up for people.<br/>\nCool. What faction are the rock dervishes?<br/>\nI have a lvl 29 DE wizard. I want to get her high enough to group port to<br/>\nEC. Right now she can do Toxx, NK, and GFay. But EC would be much more<br/>\nuseful to port to. Finding groups is difficult for her. I want to find<br/>\nsomething I can solo that won&#39;t kill my faction with my DE kin but won&#39;t<br/>\nruin any good faction i&#39;ve earned with the good guys.<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; When I was a level 14 druid someone on the list suggested Lavastorm.<br/>\n&gt; I was there until level 19. The loot is pretty good, cash anything<br/>\n&gt; from poor to fair, and the hunting interesting. Getting there was a<br/>\n&gt; special adventure for me, as I am KOS in Neriak. I went in chamo and<br/>\n&gt; levitated, turned left as I entered the forest, and kept to the zone<br/>\n&gt; wall. There is a river half way through the zone, which I levved<br/>\n&gt; across (not being a good swimmer) and kept on along the wall.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really liked the rock dervishes. Good cash and they dropped ore,<br/>\n&gt; which sells well but is heavy. I would pick up a load until I was<br/>\n&gt; encumbered even with strength, then port to a selling point. If you<br/>\n&gt; can find someone to port the stuff out at a discount, the ore would<br/>\n&gt; be profitable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I mostly solo, so that is what I did there. Lots of fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good hunting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., Pedgar1787@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Where to go to fight for a 15 Shaman?
