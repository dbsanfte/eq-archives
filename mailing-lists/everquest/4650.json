All you needed to do was to constantly spam the group with <br/>\ntext in the language you wanted to teach, assuming of course, you <br/>\nknew the language.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   It&#39;s not uncommon for a guide or gm to make claims about the game <br/>\n </span></blockquote>as it is or was and for those claims to be totally baseless, I <br/>\nsuspect that they lie as often as not.  Keep in mind that the <br/>\ndevelopment team recently suggested that people could interupt a <br/>\nspell being cast on horseback by making a hotkey that consisted of <br/>\ntwo lines, /dismount and /duck<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Anyone wanna explain why that won&#39;t work?

I used to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be able to teach a language to my group and get better at it.  This <br/>\nis no longer so, and I talked to a GM who told me this was never so.  <br/>\nI was also told that something changed in respect to languages and <br/>\nzoning or something.  I am quite curious about this, as I am trying <br/>\nto learn every language I can.  I was also curious if you could teach <br/>\nover your own knowledge in the language.
