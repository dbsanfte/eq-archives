So, I wearied of mugging Frost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Giants in various locations, and went looking for something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting to do solo. I first returned to some favorite haunts where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I knew Hill Giants were and took a few of those. A bit more profitable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than Frost Giants, but not so interesting that I spent much time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hunting them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, I decided to try CC. Went to the Rygor fortress, and found the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little building at the back. Could see the &quot;snowball&quot; inside, but an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; iron bar gate was blocking the doorway. I had never heard of this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being there. Anyone know what is up? Was I just not fully informed, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is this gate something new?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Barto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
