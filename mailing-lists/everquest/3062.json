The key to soloing a ranger is to pick and choose \nyour kills.&nbsp; They almost always have to be blue cons.&nbsp; Heal and med \nbetween kills.&nbsp; In Lake Rathe, the best place to go until 20 is Jonas, a \nmonk hermit.&nbsp; Make sure you snare him when pulling.&nbsp; He is a \nconsistent level 14 or 15 spawn on about a 6 minute timer.&nbsp; In LOIO, stay \nnear the beach, and use track to find the blues to kill.&nbsp; Experience will \ntell you which mobs hit harder than others, for about the same amount of xp \ngained.&nbsp; Oasis, kill dervs, if you can split them, orcs, or gators.&nbsp; \nThere is also Crushbone, camping the legionnaires.&nbsp; Befallen, on the second \nlevel.&nbsp; Blackburrow, camping the high level mobs in there.&nbsp; Unrest, in \nthe courtyard, but stay near the walls when medding, due to trains.&nbsp; Upper \nGuk, The Warrens, and Najena are good too.&nbsp; There are lots of options at \nyour level, it just takes a bit of experimentation to find the area you like \nbest, if soloing.&nbsp; SK, LOIO, and Unrest will take you to 30, \neasily.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp; In groups, agro control is very important, \nas odds are that you will not have as much AC as that tank you are working \nwith.&nbsp; Backing off of the mob for a sec or two, not casting on the mob as \noften, and not hitting that taunt button are effective for agro control.&nbsp; \nIf the mob turns and smacks you only every once in a while, then you are right \nwhere you need to be, since just as soon as that cleric over heals, or the \ncaster nukes too much, the mob will be on them, and you&#39;ll need to cast, and \ntaunt to pull them back off the healer/caster that overdid it.&nbsp; \n</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp; Grouping a ranger at the lower levels can at \ntimes be frustrating, as unless a couple people in the group are playing lower \nlevel alts, people don&#39;t quite understand how a ranger fits into the grouping \nscheme.&nbsp; This does fade, however, so should not be taken personally.&nbsp; \nThe good news is, that if you tend to solo more than group, you can easily solo \na ranger all the way to 60, if you want to.&nbsp; It just takes a bit of \npatience, and knowing where to go.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">If you feel like it, you are more than welcome to \nemail me directly, if you have more questions, or need advice.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Rich</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Naedarie</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">41 Wood Elf Ranger</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Onego</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">32 Gnome Magician</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Iinthe</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">21 Barbarian Shaman</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Banaf</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">16 Dwarven Cleric</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Satist</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">12 Troll SK</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Senandary</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">12 Human Monk</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The Rathe</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"rlebeau65@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">Rob LeBeau</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Tuesday, June 18, 2002 9:47 \nAM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] getting \n  started</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>I agree and understsand most of this but what or \n  how<br>does a ranger aggro control?<br><br>Mine is 18 and I find it a little \n  tough getting exp<br>right now.&nbsp;
