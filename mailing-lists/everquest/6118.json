I <br/>\ndo havfe a question. No th Trade skills, Im understand most of them, they&#39;re <br/>\npretty straitforward...but I do have a question bout the cooking one. Why? I <br/>\nunderstand smithing...get ore, make bars, make weapons/armour...I know in <br/>\nEQ, every so many time units, you automaticlly eat food. Since rations and <br/>\nmilk will fill this funcion,  what is the purpose of cookin and brewing? Do <br/>\nyou get more food value out of something you&#39;ve made, as oppoised to the <br/>\nrations and bisquits? Can you eat the food and get boosts from it? Same <br/>\nthing for the brewing? Or is it just a vanity thing to be walking around <br/>\nwith something you cooked as opposed to the iron raions and milk thing...<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nA human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,<br/>\nbutcher a hog, design a building, con a ship, write a sonnet, balance<br/>\naccounts, build a wall, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders,<br/>\ncooperate, act alone, solve an equation, analyze a new problem, pitch<br/>\nmanure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die<br/>\ngallantly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Specialization is for insects.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert A.
