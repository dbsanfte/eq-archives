I have a full compliment of alts on the Maelyn <br/>\nStarpyre server and was playing with my little cleric (lvl 25) the <br/>\nother day. I started a task and got booted from the net when my net <br/>\nsecurity picked up someone trying to get on my system. I had <br/>\ncollected all of my objects and was working on my kills for the <br/>\ntask. I lost all of the objects and the kills.  I got back on and <br/>\nfound that. I tried again later that night and did not finish before <br/>\nI got to tired to play. Again, it was all gone when I logged back <br/>\non. So tasks have to be finished before you log or get booted. I&#39;m <br/>\nlaughing about it now but at the time it was very frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisteria<br/>\nPaladin of Norrath<br/>\nNanianya <br/>\nSister of Misteria, Ranger of Norrath<br/>\nCarillion<br/>\nSister to Misteria and Healer to All Norrathians<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Wulfric Rennison&quot; &lt;wulftech@e...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I tried one task.

Rezize your task window to see the <br/>\nrewards.  These tasks are not easily soloable, but if you get a <br/>\ngroup you can finish them fairly quickly.  My first task was to <br/>\ncollect 4 bone chips and kill 10 reanimated mobs in Chardok.  It <br/>\ntook awhile but it was good xp and a 58pp reward.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Raido<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Chris <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, September 21, 2004 1:54 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Task system<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I just got Omens of War, and I&#39;ve been trying to find <br/>\n </span></blockquote>information <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   about the new task system.
