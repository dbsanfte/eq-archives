Now, I&#39;m not one to <br/>\nstand in front of a mirror primping, but I sure look good!  I need to add <br/>\nsomething for strength though.  I have a studded collar and a cutthroat <br/>\ninsigna ring, but I need lots and lots of strength, any suggestions?  Why do <br/>\nI need more strength you may ask, I need the weight capacity.  I only have 75 <br/>\nnaturally.  My armour takes up most of that and i no longer run while in run <br/>\nmode-more like crawl.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, where can I get more of this blackened iron?<br/>\n<br/>\nPanolasi, lvl 10 half-elf Ranger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
