I am not gonna spend <br/>\n&gt;ANOTHER month and 200 hours in guk to get ghoulbane again just because I <br/>\n&gt;forgot to go to a smith to repair it.. Personally I can spend weeks out in <br/>\n&gt;nowhere not going to a city at all, I don&#39;t want to have to travel back to <br/>\n&gt;a city all the time to repair items.. It&#39;s hard enough to get them, don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;want to have to repair them aswell.. This is a damn stupid idea if you ask <br/>\n&gt;me, good for player trade skill economy perhaps but it still is crap.. Oh <br/>\n&gt;and with the latest patch, Verant apparently want all the paladins to be <br/>\n&gt;blacksmiths, so smithing will be pretty crowded as a trade skill..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>SNIP SNIP<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say my suggestions are/were fullproof.
