They said there was a free or trial download so I could <br>\ngive it a try this weekend. I thought what a perfect opportunity to <br>\ntry it while I have a couple of days off.<br>\n<br>\nWell, my problem is that I don&#39;t know what site to download the game <br>\nfrom or what version. I mean there is a Everquest 2 and there are 7 <br>\nday trials and a 30 day one but only if you are on a certain server <br>\netc. I&#39;m so confused and I haven&#39;t even started the game...lol. <br>\n<br>\nSo, if anyone knows of the best site to download from I&#39;d really <br>\nappreciate it. I can&#39;t call my co-workers since I dont know their <br>\nphone numbers off hand. I guess I&#39;d like to be able to have the <br>\ndownload from a place that has several servers so I can find my co-<br>\nworkers on there when I see them next. <br>\n<br>\nOh by the way I&#39;m not sure if this makes a difference when <br>\ndownloading etc. but after talking with my co-workers about <br>\ncharacters/classes etc. I decided I would like to be an Elf :)<br>\n<br>\nThanks a bunch in advance for all of your help and hope to see you <br>\nplaying Everquest soon!<br>\n<br>\nthx,<br>\n<br>\nRamona<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n    </div>  \n\n    \n    <span style=\"color:white;\"></span>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote><br /><hr />Invite your mail contacts to join your friends list with Windows Live Spaces.
