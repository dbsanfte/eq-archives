The most important things that needs","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1886151638\">What is the goal with the guild? There are many without a set goal just<br/>\ninviting people randomly for no apparent reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important things that needs to be adressed by a guild is:<br/>\n<br/>\nHandling of loot (this is a central driving force for many playing eq, like<br/>\nit or not)<br/>\nLeading events/Raids<br/>\nHandling of recruiting<br/>\nSelling off uneeded loot to finance guild<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most common misconception (in my opinion) is that cause youre a part of<br/>\na guild you get groups and items for free. You dont. You work for them and<br/>\nsometimes group within guild sometimes outside. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso running a guild costs in game money. Make sure guild is well on<br/>\nfinances so you can give clerics/chanters/wizards/magicians reagents for<br/>\nraiding and not worry about beeing broke all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nStructure and leadership organization. How many officers, what do they do,<br/>\nis there a set chain of command. Democracy is good, but not in all<br/>\nquestions. The larger you get the more likely that one person doesnt like<br/>\nanother, this happens but they still need to be able to respect each other.<br/>\nDifferences in opinions and personality exists, deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo simplify these tasks its much easier to have offline boards that can<br/>\nhandle organizational tasks apart from the online enjoyment. This is pretty<br/>\nmuch the same as playing for a team in any sport that requires 10+ people.<br/>\nHow well everyone understands and likes the goal of the guild will determine<br/>\nhow successful you are. Its a bit harder here cause things that are written<br/>\ncan easily be misunderstood cause of age and language differences. Be very<br/>\nclear, try to print a set of rules or guildelines. <br/>\n<br/>\nEncourage people to be a part of the team...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some small tips from the top of my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanina Fyrecurls<br/>\n60 Virtuoso<br/>\nGuildleader of Landslide on Ayonae Ro<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.landslide-guild.com\">http://www.landslide-guild.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forum.landslide-guild.com\">http://forum.landslide-guild.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: jcpatrick [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcpatrick@...\">jcpatrick@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 07, 2002 6:49 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Guild Leaders Guide.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHail and well met.
