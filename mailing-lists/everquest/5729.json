When I looked into it I noticed it said<br/>\nplayer of &quot;mid-level&quot; characters.  Since my highest is 17 now, I think that<br/>\nis why I was left out.  Not sure if this matters to you, but since the keys<br/>\nwere sent out starting May 31, you might have missed it because of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a note, all keys not used go bad July 2, so if you have one you might<br/>\nwant to use it or let us know about it pretty soon.

I have an EQ acount<br/>\n&gt; already, but I believe it must have been inactive when<br/>\n&gt; they first sent the buddy keys out. I recently<br/>\n&gt; re-subscribed at the first of June, so I&#39;m not sure<br/>\n&gt; when these keys came out. I was kind of hoping to get<br/>\n&gt; one for my sister. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
