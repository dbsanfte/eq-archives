The post said that because it<br/>\ntakes so much time to investigate hacked accounts, they will from now on<br/>\njust ban all accounts that have been compromised.. IE, if someone reports an<br/>\naccount hacked, and they check that another IP has been logged on to it,<br/>\nthey just ban it and won&#39;t return it to the rightful owner because it&#39;s OUR<br/>\nresponsibility to keep our accounts secure.. I feel real sorry for all the<br/>\npeople that don&#39;t have their own computer and play on a friends computer, or<br/>\nat a netcafe, because you don&#39;t have any control over that systems security,<br/>\nthose people are SOL now.. Verant are f-in lazy that&#39;s my point..<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine has been away from EQ on vacation for a month, he was to<br/>\nreturn to playing last week..<br/>\nYesterday he talked to me through a new account he had to buy and told me<br/>\nhis old account had been banned because someone had hacked his account while<br/>\nhe was away on vacation.. And no, he won&#39;t get it back because according to<br/>\nVerant, it was his fault that someone hacked it..(duh) It&#39;s another thing<br/>\nthat you give out your account info to a &quot;friend&quot; and that dude hacks it..<br/>\nBut this was not the case for my guildmate(level 55 rogue with epic etc)..<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the time I have played EQ(from day 1, and even some in beta), I have<br/>\nlost over 10 guildmates to different kinds of &quot;hacking&quot;, some were hacked by<br/>\n&quot;friends&quot; they gave their info to, and some were just plain hacked..<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d gladly PAY to have this service availible to me(Verant investigates and<br/>\ndoes their best to return my account if it is hacked) if I could..<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron K&#39;Nighit - Paladin 48<br/>\n- Dunbar Keglifter - Cleric 59<br/>\n- Meron Shadowdale - Rogue 53</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
