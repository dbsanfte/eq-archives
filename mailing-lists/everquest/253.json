At 16th Level, I acquired the research skill and have acquired<br/>\nthe Lexicon, the Wizard&#39;s Canon, the Wizard&#39;s Dictionary (maybe<br/>\nincorrect name, but it is something like that), and other assorted items<br/>\n(pen and parchment).  I have picked up a number of rune stones, pieces<br/>\nof the grimmoire, and words.  I understand that you combine these in<br/>\nsome specific combination in the lexicon to make spells or something.<br/>\nThe issue I bring before you is that when I made 17th level, I could not<br/>\npractice my research, which indicated that the only way to raise my<br/>\nresearch was by trail and error using the lexicon to combine items to<br/>\ntry to make something.  At this time, I can only make out a few words on<br/>\nthe pages in the Wizard&#39;s Canon and the Wizard&#39;s Dictionary.  Since some<br/>\nof the components I have acquired are worth as much as 2 plat, which is<br/>\nstill a good bit of money to me for me, I am reluctant to just put them<br/>\nrandomly into the lexicon to try to combine them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question to this great group of veteran adventurers is three fold.<br/>\nOne, is there any other way of raising one&#39;s research outside of<br/>\ncombining items within the lexicon?  Two, is the reading of the words in<br/>\nthe Wizard&#39;s Canon and Dictionary based on the research skill, your<br/>\nlanguage skill, your level, something else entirely, or some combination<br/>\nof skills?  Are there any web sites that give additional information on<br/>\nresearch and the combination of components to make spells or such?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would greatly appreciate you words of wisdom and advice on this<br/>\nmatter.<br/>\n<br/>\nFindar<br/>\nWizard Apprentice</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
