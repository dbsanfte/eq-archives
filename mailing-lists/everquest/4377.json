Except they wouldn&#39;t do<br/>\ncoin conversion.<br/>\nI also kinda wish the horses and stuff could be like the ones in D&D where<br/>\nthere are different kinds. Ones to carry stuff, ones for riding, or ones for<br/>\nfighting. And riding could be a skill.<br/>\nI really wish they&#39;d lower horse prices... I don&#39;t want one for prestige. I<br/>\nwant one that is useful. For the prices horses cost they should give you<br/>\n+100 to your charisma.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hey, that&#39;s pretty cool!
