Oh look!  Soulbinders!  LOL  I feel the Legend just goes to show that this relaxing of the Nazi regime (youre in their world now) was just superficial, as they have now shafted the community once again.  They used finances from SoL (not to mention game improvements promised) and some of our $10 a month to build a super server (quoted as populated by 80% level 60s!) showing their true colors once again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI SERIOULSY wish my addiction would release me to stand by my principles and quit.

Any new zone or revamped zone<br/>\nwill go to the Legend server first to be beta tested for a bit and the<br/>\npatched to the $10 a month servers. Just look at the new and revamped Cazic<br/>\nThule zone. The Legend server has this now and I&#39;m sure the VI employee that<br/>\nworked this revamp is watching this zone being played on the Legend Server<br/>\nand making sure everything is working as intended. One day the $10 servers<br/>\nshould see the new Cazic Thule.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy feeling on the legend server is that VI stole some of my money I paid for<br/>\nSoL. When I bought SoL I was under the impression I would receive some new<br/>\nfeatures with this expansion. I received some of the features, but not all<br/>\nof them. So where are feature X, Y and Z? Where is my money I paid for these<br/>\nfeatures? Some of the money was spent working on the new Legends server, no<br/>\ndoubt about it. There is no way you could hire and train all the new GM<br/>\nneeded to cover the new requirements in that short of time without taking<br/>\naway from the $10 paying customer before the $40 payments start rolling in.<br/>\nWho was the employees revamping Cazic Thule? How many hours did it take to<br/>\ncomplete this task? Why wasn&#39;t all those hard spent hours revamping the<br/>\nCazic Thule spent on working on things thousands of people already paid for<br/>\nwith SoL? None of that makes sense to me . . .  but oh well, I sure do not<br/>\nloose sleep over it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut other than the reason above, I think the Legends idea is good for VI. It<br/>\nshould bring in more money for VI and that money will only make EQ a better<br/>\ngame, but it is just the wrong time. There will always be a market for<br/>\npeople to pay more and VI knows that. I know that would like some aspects of<br/>\nthe Legends server, but the scales do not even come close to lean the<br/>\nLegends side. One of the main pluses for EQ is all the friends and guild<br/>\nmates you talk to throughout your characters life. I would guess that the<br/>\ncost of $480 per year and the lose of all the friends you&#39;ve made of the<br/>\nyears would be the main reasons lots of people would not move. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts,<br/>\nSistily<br/>\nGnome Warlord<br/>\nTunare Server<br/>\n<br/>\nTigole from the SoL site made a nice comparison:<br/>\n\tLegends: &quot;You can piss down my back but don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s raining.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t dwell on Legends for too long today. Yes, I could sit here and write<br/>\na novel on why Legends is a bad thing for the majority of Everquest. But I<br/>\nsimply don&#39;t have time. I just didn&#39;t want the opening of the new Legends<br/>\nserver to pass by without being able to say a quick and heart-felt, Fuck You<br/>\nIn the Goatass, to all involved with it. I&#39;ve heard all the arguments before<br/>\nabout getting what you pay for and &quot;don&#39;t go to McDonald&#39;s and expect Filet<br/>\nMignon&quot; and other such brilliant and well thought out defenses. I haven&#39;t<br/>\nseen such legal spindoctoring since Johnny Cochran helped my beloved Juice<br/>\n(go Trojans!) murder two people and walk away scott-free. But let&#39;s face the<br/>\nfacts, all of the features that were promised to us with the release of SoL<br/>\nare still not here. Seems to me Legends is a pretty new service. Doesn&#39;t it<br/>\nsurprise anyone how fast the &quot;new&quot; Cazic Thule was revamped for the server?<br/>\nCould it possibly be the jackass whose job it was to make the Bazaar work<br/>\nlike it was ADVERTISED was instead buffing up Lizards in CT for Daddy<br/>\nWarbucks on Stormhammer? Where&#39;s my new interface? Where&#39;s my new visible<br/>\narmor? Like it or not folks the people on our Poor Folk Ghetto Servers spent<br/>\nmoney on PROMISED features which as of today do not exist. You guys still<br/>\ngoing to run and defend the Legends losers with the old, &quot;You get what you<br/>\npay for&quot; jibberish? Guess what? We didn&#39;t get what we paid for. I went to<br/>\nMcDonald&#39;s expecting a goddamn Big Mac, not Filet Mignon, and you know what<br/>\nI got instead?
