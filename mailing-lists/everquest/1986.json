With the SoL expansion you can set it on a low res<br/>\n&gt; version of the entire game or high if you choose to ( that includes both<br/>\n&gt; game world and player models ).  The whole problem here is when Microsoft<br/>\n&gt; made a majority of video cards obsolete with the release of directx 8..<br/>\n&gt; PERIOD...  Everquest is over 3 years old now.  When it was first released<br/>\n&gt; Directx was in release 6.  Since then with the introduction of Kunark and<br/>\n&gt; Velious, players were required to upgrade to release 7.

I<br/>\n&gt; guarantee that if any other game out there attempted to provide the<br/>\n&gt; enhancements and a quality product that incorporated the latest video<br/>\n&gt; standards they would be experiencing the same problem.
