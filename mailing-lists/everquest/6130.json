My latency makes it nearly impossible to hunt. I get my ass kicked by greens. So I&#39;m back to not getting xp. On the bright side, my Sims2 game is working now so I can play it instead. I can&#39;t play online games when it&#39;s raining anyways and the weather has been bad.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-03-20, 07:38:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Bah, no fair.

They&#39;ve revamped Splitpaw, the Bazaar, and Lavastorm. Added new wayfarer type camps and new zones. You can now zone into the bazaar from PoK. There is also a guild hall where you can summon your corpse to and have it rezzed by any available clerics. There is now ingame email to send messages to people when they are offline... A whole guild messenging center in the guild hall where people can look for guilds and guilds can look for people.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;If you get mnemonic retention with AA points it gives you a 9th spellslot...
