They level faster than people who actually level<br/>\n&gt; themselves.  I understand how you would think this is not really fair<br/>\n&gt; but sometimes people like to help others.  When I help people, I PL<br/>\n&gt; them.  I won&#39;t help them get equipment because that&#39;s what you need<br/>\n&gt; to do for yourself since it generally makes you more powerful<br/>\n&gt; especially magical items.  AND when I PL them, I don&#39;t take over<br/>\n&gt; camps to help them level.  I just look around for roaming mobs that<br/>\n&gt; are not a RARE of course and let them kill it.  Heal them when<br/>\n&gt; necessary.  The usual method.  I don&#39;t steal camps from people or<br/>\n&gt; camp things when tyring to PL &#39;em.  I know that&#39;s wrong cuz if I did<br/>\n&gt; that I would feel like I&#39;m hogging the camp since I wouldn&#39;t get xp<br/>\n&gt; in the first place and it&#39;s a camp that everyone wants to have.  For<br/>\n&gt; example, PLing in cb.  I just look for any orcs i see and let them<br/>\n&gt; kill it.  There are hardly any camps in there.  The only camps there<br/>\n&gt; are in cb are in the castle itself and near the tents.  Anyway, my<br/>\n&gt; point is, is that I find it wrong when people take over camps to PL<br/>\n&gt; but I find it ok when people just kill roaming mobs to PL.  AND yeah,<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like when peopel twink.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t give peopel<br/>\n&gt; equipment or money.  Maybe leather armor but that&#39;s about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Dan&quot; &lt;danspth@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Opinions vary. I personally find the whole power leveling idea to<br/>\n&gt; be most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dishonorable. To see an orc camp taken over by a 50+ druid and a lv<br/>\n&gt; 6 ogre<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer reminds me how people are<br/>\n&gt; have no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; willingness to work for things (the whole cheat code thing). But<br/>\n&gt; many people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find it ok to twink/power level and, well, so be it. I can see it,<br/>\n&gt; shiver,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and keep moving. Live and let live. I am fortunate that at lv 43 I<br/>\n&gt; can solo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and this is only an inconvience at worse to me instead of a real<br/>\n&gt; issue. But<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up until lv 35 I was still having camps stolen from me by uber<br/>\n&gt; twinks and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anon druids.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Thomas H.
