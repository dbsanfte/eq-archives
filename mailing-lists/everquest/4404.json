I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1159855014\">As a lvl 60 druid with a horse I&#39;ve got to say I never knew how much I needed my horse until I had him. For the aggro management alone it&#39;s worth the 8k.<br/>\nI notice the difference drastically when I&quot;m grouped in outdoor zones opposed to inside zones. For example, had a group in Plane of Storms (outside zone) stayed on my horse and never got aggro once. Next night was in North Temple of Veeshan, tried to sit between fights and picked up aggro everytime something popped. From a casters point of view and the damage the mobs do with one hit at higher levels. One hit can sometimes be deadly. Wouldn&#39;t use the horse for solo&#39;ing because of the slow start stop time, but in groups it&#39;s the greatest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love my horse, the only thing that I hate is the visual of the horses head and ears that get in the way of your targeting. The new LoY lizards supposedly do not have that problem so even if it&#39;s a 1.5k plat hit for a trade in. I might make the change. Although it will all depend on if I can find a lizard to match my new dyed blue outfit :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 11, 2003 5:06 AM<br/>\nTo: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Digest Number 706<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 7 messages in this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nTopics in this digest:<br/>\n<br/>\n      1.

I use to be scared <br/>\nof the same thing, but trust me, you always find it. Besides, it stays there <br/>\nfor days, so you have a long, long time to find it and get your stuff back. <br/>\nJust remember what zone you died in, and you will be fine. And if you can&#39;t <br/>\nfind it for some odd reason, call for a Necromancer... they have locate <br/>\ncorpse and can help you find it in no time!
