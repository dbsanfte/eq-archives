Verant says the investigations on compromised<br/>\naccounts take away too much time for the GMs to do customer support, so now<br/>\nthey are just going to ban all accounts that are compromised.. That&#39;s what I<br/>\ncall really f-in BAD customer support.. It&#39;s like an insurance.. Knowing<br/>\nthat if someone steals your car, or breaks into it and steal your brand new<br/>\nLodizal Shell Stereo, the insurance company will help you out and cough up a<br/>\nnew one for you.. Verant sux! Maybe they could charge a fee like the<br/>\ninsurance companies do, from people whos accounts have been compromised in<br/>\norder to investigate and rectify the situation, but BAN THEM? That is SO<br/>\nF-IN WRONG!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron K&#39;Nighit - Paladin 48<br/>\n- Dunbar Keglifter - Cleric 59<br/>\n- Meron Shadowdale - Rogue 53<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
