If a<br/>\nmerchant will not sell to you.. sneak and move up behind them, then right<br/>\nclick as usual to start up a buying session.  Be sure to consider a mob in<br/>\nboth situations.. it should tell you they are indifferent, else otherwise<br/>\nthey can see you.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrior to backstab... Its not really necessary to attack from behind for you<br/>\ngain no benefit without the skill.  Yet its good practice.  It&#39;s also easier<br/>\nto know when a mob is mad at you so you can evade.  Remember when grouped<br/>\nwith others take full advantage of using Evade ( turn off attack and click<br/>\nhide ) if successful the mob will turn away from you and you can continue<br/>\nattacking =)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable traps is a under used skill.  There are a number of traps through<br/>\nout the game.   Yet most of them were rendered harmless..  (example.. the<br/>\nswinging axe in sola  -  and the dropping stone in solb ) You can train it<br/>\nanytime and anywhere by simply clicking on the skill button.  Yeah I know<br/>\nthat sounds dumb but that&#39;s how its done.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember when your a rogue your hide and sneak buttons work differently from<br/>\nother classes..  You can enable both of them and move around unseen by<br/>\nnearly every mob in the game.  Comes in handy when pulling your friends<br/>\ncorpses from dangerous areas.  Or joining a group that&#39;s deep in a dungeon<br/>\nundetected by the mobs that have respawn =)<br/>\n<br/>\nDuHase 55 Outrider<br/>\nCrete 33 Rogue<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Miewald@...\">John_Miewald@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Miewald@...\">John_Miewald@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 22, 2001 12:28 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Hi, I am new & stupid :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a brand spankin&#39; new rogue and I have some questions.  I would<br/>\ngreatly appreciate any feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  How does &quot;sneak&quot; work exactly?  Can I sneak across someone&#39;s line of<br/>\nsight?  What is the difference between &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; that comes later?<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.  Does it do me any good to<br/>\nattack monsters from behind without the ability yet?  I have been making an<br/>\neffort to do just that, but should I not even bother?<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot recall<br/>\nhaving ever seen or heard of a trap in EQ.  Can anyone give an example of<br/>\nwhere and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>\nthere is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Alazais&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
