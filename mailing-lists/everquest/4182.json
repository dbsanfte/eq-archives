I had some problems until I learned to <br/>\nclear out the rediculous number of background aps that the factory <br/>\nsoftware load stuffs into these package systems. After that, the os <br/>\nwas not the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get adequate operation on all older EQ software. Up through <br/>\nVelious. Very choppy on Luclin and POP. Planning to do an upgrade <br/>\nnext year. Figure I can maximize my experience in the old world until <br/>\nthen. There is still plenty to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In EverQuest@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Fire on High&quot; &lt;scendera@o...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think it&#39;s actually 768 megs for WinME...and don&#39;t ever let <br/>\n </span></blockquote>anyone tell you that ME&#39;s not suitable for EQ. My primary EQ box for <br/>\nover 3 years has been a 450 mhz k6-3 box with 256 megs ram, that ran <br/>\nME. Rock solid, reliable, no compatibility issues...it&#39;s great. ME <br/>\nhas never given me anything like the problems I&#39;ve seen others talk <br/>\nabout. Only time it ever acted up is when the cpu fan was <br/>\nfailing....obviously not the OS&#39;s fault. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Justin <br/>\n&gt;   To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 07, 2003 10:16 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: video cards<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       I have 512 mb ram not 412.
