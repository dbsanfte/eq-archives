Can&#39;t wait till they put this into the other<br/>\nservers!<br/>\n\tTest Server Update 6/3/99 6:30 pm <br/>\n\tThe following features and bug fixes have gone up onto the Test<br/>\nserver. <br/>\n\t- Charmed and Feared characters can no longer use skills. <br/>\n\t- The appropriate text message is given while attempting to attack<br/>\nwhile charmed. <br/>\n\t- Procing weapons no longer break Bard&#39;s singing. <br/>\n\t- Players vision will now return to normal if killed while drunk. <br/>\n\t- Tree Form spells will change the caster into a human male in a<br/>\nzone without trees. <br/>\n\t- Red and Blue armor will now appear the proper color for AMD users.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t- While accessing the /bug screen, the in-game chat bar will no<br/>\nlonger remain active. <br/>\n\t- If the inventory window is up and the spell book is open, the user<br/>\nwill not remove items from their inventory when clicking on the spell book. <br/>\n\t- A number of quests were fixed as well as implemented. <br/>\n\t- A Bad language filter has been implemented. Typing &quot;/filter&quot; will<br/>\ntoggle it on and off. <br/>\n\t- Pets that have been commanded to sit will no longer to appear to<br/>\nstand up while they are supposed to be seated. <br/>\n\t- Certain Bard spells will now require the use of Mana if noted. <br/>\n\t- While in the full screen view, users may now toggle the<br/>\ntranslucent overlay backgrounds on and off by pressing the &quot;~&quot; key. <br/>\n\t- Players may now loot corpses in shallow water or lava by typing<br/>\n&quot;/loot&quot; while the corpse is targeted. <br/>\n\t- We have implemented an Auto-follow command. To auto-follow another<br/>\ncharacter, target the character, then type &quot;/follow&quot;. <br/>\n\t- A Role Playing switched has been added so that players may<br/>\nidentify other characters that are Role Playing. To activate the Role<br/>\nPlaying switch, target your character and type &quot;/roleplay&quot;, if the character<br/>\nis +PvP, the name tag above their head will appear as a darker shade of Red,<br/>\nwhereas a non-PvP players name will appear purple. <br/>\n\tTrade Skill Changes <br/>\n\tJewel Craft - All of the jewelry has had increased magical<br/>\nproperties, however, the existing item remain unchanged. <br/>\n\tFletching - When fletching arrows, they will be produced in sets of<br/>\n5, instead of 1. <br/>\n\tBaking, Blacksmithing, Brewing, and Pottery have been changed to<br/>\neither return items on failure and be able to produce multiple items and<br/>\nquantities on success. <br/>\n\tExample: Baking muffins - success means the player will receive<br/>\nthree muffins and retaining the muffin tin, however, when unsuccessful, the<br/>\nplayer will still get the muffin tin back and lose all other components.<br/>\nAnother example would be if a player wishes to sharpen a rusty short sword.<br/>\nIf the player succeeds, they will receive a tarnished short sword, however,<br/>\nfailure will result in retaining the rusty weapon but losing the sharpening<br/>\nstone. <br/>\n\t- The EverQuest Team <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChris aka Thunderheart<br/>\nLevel 21<br/>\nWood-Elf<br/>\nDruid<br/>\nInnoruuk server<br/>\n---=== Divine Wind ===---</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
