That has never happened when I used flash of light. They<br/>\nalways make a b-line straight toward me and can cast spells and hit me<br/>\nwherever I move to. It&#39;s irritating.

They are different spells....last longer<br/>\nbut break easier with damage. I never use them either. And here is something<br/>\nthat can help you....root...Flash of Light...blast at will.

I want to be able to go into dungeons for<br/>\nexperience instead of outdoor kiting. One of the characters I would like to<br/>\nbe is a paladin. I have been playing a paladin/magician duo and it seems<br/>\nreally good for dungeon play. I have been looking at necromancers, shaman<br/>\nand druids as well. They all seem to have their strengths and weaknesses.<br/>\nPaladin/Shaman duo seems really good, as the Shaman would be like a third<br/>\ntank.
