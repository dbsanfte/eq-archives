I haven&#39;t been feeling the<br/>\nurge to log in much since they did that, so I was one<br/>\nof the ones who voted to let people solo, even with a<br/>\npenality... I&#39;d enjoy it more than begging for groups<br/>\nin the planes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in the game since 4/1/99 so I think I can<br/>\nsay with certainty that its a million times easier<br/>\nthan it used to be.  Many more zones, much less<br/>\ncrowding, tons of more items, features like the Bazaar<br/>\nand being able to move around without a drood&#39;s help,<br/>\netc.  Its a better game now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;d give it all back to not have to beg for<br/>\ngroups.  Sitting and spinning on my arse while I wait<br/>\nfor a group desperate enough to take a monk is a<br/>\nbummer, and not fun in my view.  Figuring out a<br/>\nstratagy to solo certain spots was great fun for me,<br/>\nas well as the competition with other solo&#39;s for the<br/>\ngood spots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t care so much about the monk nerf power wise<br/>\nexcept that it came at a time when we were being<br/>\nforced to group past 60... double whammy that makes it<br/>\nhard to get in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuwi Changkane, Fenin Ro Grandmaster<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- hoggtyed &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hoggtyed@...\">hoggtyed@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     I agree it is hard but c3 and c2 truly unbalance<br/>\n&gt; the game a young <br/>\n&gt; chanter had no chance to group.  No one needed you<br/>\n&gt; it also took away <br/>\n&gt; from bards as mana batteries.  I am glad they<br/>\n&gt; balanced it.  The <br/>\n&gt; reason you are upset with your toon is its off the<br/>\n&gt; crack and feeling <br/>\n&gt; the shock of withdrawal.  Suck it up and learn to<br/>\n&gt; play your toon.  <br/>\n&gt; You will be glad you did later.  Its easy to play<br/>\n&gt; any class if its <br/>\n&gt; twinked out or buffed to the hilt.  Find a class you<br/>\n&gt; like buck naked <br/>\n&gt; and unbuffed thats where you will be happy in the<br/>\n&gt; long haul.  For me <br/>\n&gt; it was the Monk and Beastlord. A good place to try<br/>\n&gt; all the classes is <br/>\n&gt; on the test server do the test buff and bam your 25<br/>\n&gt; with decent gear.<br/>\n&gt;                   PS. For those of you with an eye<br/>\n&gt; for grammer and <br/>\n&gt; spelling, what can I say but enjoy =O`  /wink<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;                           My 2 copper Hawg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo!
