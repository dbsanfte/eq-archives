I turned around and couldnt&#39; see\n<br>it anywhere. I ran from the building and soon I was dead. Even looking down\n<br>at my corpse, whatever attacked me was not visible. I scrolled back up to\n<br>see what I had done to piss it off. All the thing said before attacking me\n<br>was &quot;How dare you!&quot; &nbsp;It didn&#39;t say anything about me being a dark elf or\n<br>whatnot.
