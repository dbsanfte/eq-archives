Lately mine has been ok though.<br/>\nOh, as for finding routers you can look them up at www.pricegrabber.com. It<br/>\nlets you add in your zip code to factor in shipping costs. It sorts by the<br/>\nbest price and has customer ratings on the products as well as customer<br/>\nratings of the stores that are offering it. So if the lowest priced store<br/>\nhas a bad rating, you can choose to get one slightly more expensive at a<br/>\nmore reliable store. I personally like yesmicro.com. I&#39;ve ordered from them<br/>\nnumerous times. I think with yesmicro you get a discount if you order a<br/>\nproduct after locating it on www.pricewatch.com. I tend to look for it on<br/>\npricegrabber then check for it on pricewatch. Another site for info on<br/>\nproducts is www.epinions.com. I tend to use all 3 to help determine what<br/>\nproduct I want.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah I supose you could do that with a standard networking hub, but best bet<br/>\nis to go with a router.  Usually doesn&#39;t require any extra software, it&#39;s<br/>\neasy to configure, and most of them have built in firewalls.    I&#39;ve never<br/>\nheard of SyGate, but Windows ME/XP both have something called Internet<br/>\nConnection sharing which essentially sets up a proxy server ont he host<br/>\nmachine and allows all the others to connect through it.  I used it before<br/>\nand its okay but a little tempermental at times when you start adding 3rd<br/>\nparty firewall software to the mix.  I&#39;d still reccomend going with a<br/>\nrouter.  Small 4 port routers aren&#39;t that expensive.  You can pick them up<br/>\nat Best buy or Comp USA for less than $60.  Just make sure you know what<br/>\nyou&#39;re getting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWulfric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
