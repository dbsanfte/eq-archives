It was a series of<br/>\ncomic strips based on EverQuest that I thought was really well done. <br/>\nI had intended on posting the link to this list, but never did.  Now<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to find the link again but I cant remember how or where I<br/>\nfound it.  So I was hoping that maybe someone here might know what I&#39;m<br/>\ntalking about.  Essentially the comic strip starts out with a female<br/>\nwood elf turning in her quest paper to become a druid, but some things<br/>\nhappen and she ends up being taken under the wing (?) of an Iksar who<br/>\nwas a friend of her father.  The Iksar character is named after the<br/>\nperson&#39;s character who draws the strip.  Hopefully this is enough<br/>\ninformation that someone might recognize it and post the link.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
