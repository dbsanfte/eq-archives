You might not want to put a housefan that close to your computer. Fans<br/>\nthat size have an electromagnetic field that can cause problems. Some fans<br/>\ncan disrupt monitors if too close. It can even erase or corrupt data on your<br/>\nharddrive. It&#39;s best to use a device specifically designed for use with a<br/>\ncomputer rather than something like that.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Amy Williams&quot; &lt;amy_e_williams@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
