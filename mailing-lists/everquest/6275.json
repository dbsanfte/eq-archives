It&#39;s a long and<br/>\nboring story, something I a m sure you don&#39;t care to hear, even if I<br/>\ncared to tell ya..lol.  But anyway, here are my thoughts on stuff. You<br/>\ncan listen to my thoughts and take my advice, listen and laugh at me,<br/>\nor click on another post. The choice is yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as AA&#39;s go, personally when my wizard hit 51/52, I did infact<br/>\ndo the AA route. It was a personal choice, I felt that a wizard as<br/>\ngood as mine is/was, needed the title &quot;Baron&quot; and so forth he got that<br/>\ntitle. Now In think of it tho, Master sounds better, but I<br/>\ndigresslol.. I did put the points into Run3 and Mana regen ( me<br/>\nthinks). I have number 8 into int. Even though I can move onto the<br/>\nnext level of AA&#39;s, class specific I think?, I choose not to, and<br/>\ndecided to continue on with the general abilities. (Excuse if my info<br/>\nis off, its been awhile and pulling it from memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as for mounts, they do have their good sides and bad sides. Good<br/>\nthat you can med and move around, so your not a target for mobs and<br/>\nsuch. Some look cool, if your all about the bling. I do not know about<br/>\nhorses, but my wizard has a white drog and when it runs, I &quot;feel&quot; like<br/>\nI am on a roller coaster, or perhaps an incredibly bumpy road with no<br/>\nshocks on the car.. Also sadly, I don&#39;t know about horses, but when I<br/>\ngo into water with my drog, it shrivels up and hides.seems vaguely<br/>\nfamiliar to me and another lizard.ROFL. Sorry..:-(<br/>\n<br/>\nBut movement is kind of bad with the slow horse. For me, it wasn&#39;t so<br/>\nmuch for movement, but for safety and meditation. But, besides the<br/>\nwater thing, I thing you should be able to name them like you would a<br/>\ntoon. But, this also goes with beastlord warder&#39;s, we should be able<br/>\nto name them..so instead of &quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;Bob&#39;s Warder&quot; you would have<br/>\n&quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;Ralph&quot;..lol..or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a question, but now I cant recall what it was,,oh well..<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always..<br/>\nGreg</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
