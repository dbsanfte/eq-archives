I am not trying to<br/>\nbe a a$$ or anything but there are a lot of people that have to pay for<br/>\ninternet services by the minute, like Europe and Japan and download<br/>\ntheir Email. You just had a 23K message that had two lines in it. So<br/>\nplease Delete any un-needed messages when you want to ask a <br/>\nquestion or reply to a message. Thanks :) (Please Note the Smiley<br/>\nFace - No Flame Intended)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSecond, I have a SB Live! also and have music in Certain<br/>\nplaces but you should check the Options when you log on. Not the<br/>\nInitial Screen but the main screen when your character is in the<br/>\nZone that you are playing in. As soon as you log on you will see the<br/>\nWindowed Screen with the text box at the bottom. Look up on the<br/>\nleft side of the screen and you should see the Options button. Click<br/>\non it and it should give you a box that has Display, Filters, Sounds,<br/>\nEtc. Click on the Sound and make sure that the music is turned up.<br/>\nWhen I installed EQ, mine was turned all the way down and I had<br/>\nto turn it up to get the music.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHope this helps and again the 1st point was not a flame but<br/>\njust a comment. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 06:56 AM 5/12/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;sun-dog&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sun-dog@...\">sun-dog@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;tech question...have an SB Live! sound card...get sounds fine for effects<br/>\n&gt;etc. but no music ever...is there a known problem with this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
