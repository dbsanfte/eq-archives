At lvl 13<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re getting into the level range for Crocs in<br/>\n&gt; Oasis, just head down there and solo or duo yourself<br/>\n&gt; up to 19-20. (groups larger than two people at that<br/>\n&gt; point just slow down the experience gain) Since you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; new, i&#39;ll give you directions how to get there. Take<br/>\n&gt; the teleport from The Nexus down to West Commonlands,<br/>\n&gt; go east from there to the East Commonlands and ask<br/>\n&gt; someone to show you where the EC Tunnel is. Go thru<br/>\n&gt; the tunnel turning right at the Shady Swashbuckler<br/>\n&gt; into Northern Desert of Ro. Head to the left til you<br/>\n&gt; hit the water and follow the beach to the Oasis of<br/>\n&gt; Marr. Continue following the beach til you get to the<br/>\n&gt; docks there, that&#39;s the rest stop in Oasis. Just go<br/>\n&gt; further down the beach and look for crocs of various<br/>\n&gt; levels to kill. (starting with Crocodiles and Caimans<br/>\n&gt; on the low end, til Deepwater Crocs on the high end)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nThe Nexus doesn&#39;t go to West Commonlands. It goes to North Karana via the<br/>\nAntonica Scion. In which case you have to go through East Karana, Highpass,<br/>\nand then West Commons. I think it&#39;s actually safer to take the portal to<br/>\nGreater Faydark (the Faydwer Scion), run to Butcherblock Mountains to the<br/>\ndocks and take the boat to Freeport. then exit the gate in East Freeport to<br/>\nrun to NrO and then Oasis.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
