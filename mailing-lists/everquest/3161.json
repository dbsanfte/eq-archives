I have cookies <br/>\n&gt; enabled, I&#39;m signed in and it says &quot;hi muddywag&quot; at the top, but it <br/>\n&gt; keeps telling me that I need to be registered.  AHHH! IWANNA KILL A <br/>\n&gt; BAT!!  By the way I CAN play the tutorial.  Which only served to let <br/>\n&gt; me know that I&#39;ll REALLY like this game- someday!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t post to the tech boards because you don&#39;t have an EQ account <br/>\nyet.  Until you finish the registration screens in the game your station <br/>\nname and password isn&#39;t associated with an EQ account.<br/>\nDo yourself a favor and delete that tutorial.  If it&#39;s the one you <br/>\ndownload off the station&#39;s website, it&#39;s very old.  It does give an idea <br/>\nof gameplay but you&#39;ll still be very lost when you play for the first <br/>\ntime.<br/>\nFirst thing you do when you do get a character started is change where <br/>\nthe autoattack key is.  Every newbie gets killed trying to talk to thier <br/>\ntrainer because they don&#39;t hit enter before they start to type<br/>\nYou click Options then Keyboard then click the field below Autoattack <br/>\nthen hit a key on the keyboard you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll use often.  Mine <br/>\nis set to Q, some people use the Insert key.  Dont use the numbers, <br/>\nanything on the number pad, Pgup, Pgdown, or any of the Fkeys or arrow <br/>\nkey; all those have a use already in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\nBebinn Maolcataig<br/>\n24 Woodelf Druid<br/>\nDignatio cum Demori guild, Bertoxxulous server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
