An enchanter is not a good choice for a first character, although <br/>\nit did make me a much better player in the long run. That was before <br/>\nbreeze came out too, so it was ultra hard. I have had my current <br/>\ncharacter for quite some time. I kind of twinked him with some basic <br/>\nstuff like banded armor and a mino axe but nothing extravagant. I got <br/>\nhim from level 23 to 30 in about a week though when I started playing <br/>\nhim again. Of course, Xegony was one of the first servers and <br/>\neveryone is totally twinked and power-leveled on that server. There <br/>\nare some aspects of the game I know a lot about, like the classes and <br/>\ntheir roles in a group. I know a lot about the enchanter and wizard <br/>\nclasses as I have a level 40 enchanter and wizard. That is good that <br/>\nyou are trying out different classes but eventually you will have to <br/>\nfigure out which one to concentrate on. What classes are you playing?<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, get some friends!  Since you&#39;re good in groups remember <br/>\nwho you were with.  It&#39;s a big help getting into guild if you know <br/>\nsomeone.  When you see them around just say hey, soon they&#39;ll start <br/>\nlooking for you.  That&#39;s the best part!<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup skills are probably the most important thing you can have in <br/>\nthe game.  As a Ranger you are sometimes asked to pull, and you need <br/>\nto know how to do that.  Otherwise you&#39;re a backup to the tank.  The <br/>\nroles change several times during the game as you progress in <br/>\nlevels.  Now I feel how poorly Rangers tank when the Mob puts the <br/>\nsmack down on me!  Maybe I should change my name to Manasponge! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen<br/>\n34th Ranger of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
