I&#39;ve got a lvl 11 sorcerer on her way to<br/>\nbecoming a wizard at some point. A few of my guildies<br/>\nfrom EQ1 are there too and we&#39;ve started up a guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not EQ1 with better graphics, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a totally new game. In some ways it&#39;s easier than<br/>\nEQ1 and in some ways it&#39;s more difficult. All in all,<br/>\nI&#39;m having a blast being a true newbie, running around<br/>\nand getting lost, and just exploring again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeath is easier to deal with, leveling seems to come<br/>\nmuch easier, quests are all over the place and they&#39;re<br/>\nworth doing, so far the community seems nice, money is<br/>\nkind of hard to come by, but that&#39;s not such a big<br/>\ndeal since the quests tend to reward with decent<br/>\narmor.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive it a shot :) I&#39;m on the Najena server.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Su &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How is EQ2?
