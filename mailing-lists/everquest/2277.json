This is old for<br/>\npeople in the raid a lot guilds and new for a few here maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts the matter of druid&#39;s doing translocates.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeres the setup: It requires a 60 bard and a druid. Have the bard load<br/>\n&quot;Kazumi&#39;s note of preservation&quot; (this is a group da song, 3 tick duration).<br/>\nInstruct the druid to say when he starts casting his port spell, have the<br/>\nbard start Kazumi immediately after druid starts. Those that want to get<br/>\nported, click off the Kazumi&#39;s note effect icon (thus removing da), druid<br/>\nkeeps it. All that removes da will be ported, rest will bounce and stay in<br/>\nzone.<br/>\n<br/>\nRinse and repeat as many times needed to safely get all melees out. (Kazumi<br/>\nhas a little reload time)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will help a lot instead of having to bind/coth or whatever method you<br/>\nhave to do to get enough porters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any useful raiding tip - share it ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI figured it out for myself but im pretty sure others have found it out<br/>\naswell, should be on some messageboard I guess.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
