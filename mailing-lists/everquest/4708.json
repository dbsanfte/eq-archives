I just made level 22 last night and when I went to get <br/>\ntraining, I had 10pp in my inventory. When I was finished I didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave any platinum left. I thought that training used your points that <br/>\nyou got from leveling and didn&#39;t cost anything? Can someone explain <br/>\nwhy it&#39;s costing to train now?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~--&gt; Get<br/>\nA Free Psychic Reading!
