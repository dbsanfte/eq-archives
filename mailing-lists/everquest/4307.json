I can, however, see how many of you would jump to your <br/>\ndefenses... I was not aware that there have been a few scammers in the group <br/>\nin the past. Sorry for jumping to conclusions. Oh, and thanks for fixing <br/>\nthat little problem with the auto. messages, Su. It was getting annoying, <br/>\nLOL.

However, like I said, it&#39;s rare that they <br/>\ndrop them, but I have looted one from before. It just takes patience, <br/>\nalthough the experience sucks... it did for me anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-= Mippon - 40 Halfling Druid =-<br/>\n-= Nevfalath - 8 Dark Elf Necromancer =-<br/>\n-= Areznia - 6 Vah Shir Beastlord =-<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?
