I <br/>\nhave tweaked the datarate to 7.0 and switched on the caching to see <br/>\nif that makes much difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the basic New Dawn with the Planes of Power expansion. The <br/>\nOptions screen however states &quot;Luclin Options&quot; - I don&#39;t know why.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the PC - maximum RAM capacity is 384MB and that is what is <br/>\ninstalled.  There is 50Gb free on the hard disk. I have noticed that <br/>\nwhile loading and zoning however, the hard disk light is always on <br/>\nmeaning it is doing alot of work. I suppose this would be the case as <br/>\nit is loading alot from the hard disk.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerformance within a zone seems fine on the whole,it is just initial <br/>\nloading and in particular the zoning times. Very often, after waiting <br/>\n5 minutes, it simply gives up and goes back to the server screen - <br/>\nvery frustrating!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other components that could be awapped are the hard disk <br/>\ncontroller - but I really don&#39;t see that making much difference since <br/>\nit is working fine, and the video controller - which is a nVidia Riva <br/>\nTNT with just 16Mb RAM. We are running DirectX 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks very much again for all of your suggestions, and I would be <br/>\ngrateful for anytthing else you can suggest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
