They also said that because of the server mergers, any<br/>\ntoons under 10 that havent been played in 6 months were deleted..:-(<br/>\n<br/>\nI had 2 toons under 10, one on each account. I had a level 9 rogue who<br/>\nwas my bazaar trader and a level 2 ranger ( who replaced a much higher<br/>\nranger that I didnt like). They both had some good stuff on them, esp<br/>\nthe ranger. Im assuming since this stuff was on them or in their<br/>\nbanks, that the stuff is gone. Many hours of hunting and killing and<br/>\nmany many several thousand plat gone and lost. Is there any way I<br/>\ncould get this stuff back when I return or is there a chance the stuff<br/>\nis there even tho the toons arent ( its been over a year since i last<br/>\nplayed regularly, 9 months since i last logged in)<br/>\n<br/>\n/em is depressed and cries like a schoolboy who got kicked in the<br/>\ncrotch by the mean little girl who had a crush on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
