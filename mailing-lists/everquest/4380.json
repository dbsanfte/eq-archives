I enjoy being an Enchantress because I am looking <br/>\n&gt; forward to some of the cool spells that I will eventually get (Charm, <br/>\n&gt; KEI, etc.) I just made Level 10 and am scared to death now because <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m afraid of getting killed, not being able to get back to my <br/>\n&gt; corpse, and losing all my stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>getting killed is part of the game: don&#39;t be afraid of it! there are only<br/>\na few zones where it is almost impossible to get back your corpse.<br/>\nbut if you really have equipment that must be recovered there are<br/>\nthree classes who you should be looking for:<br/>\n - rogues: if you know the location where you died, but other<br/>\n   classes have problems to get there and back again, get an<br/>\n   rogue. the sneak&hide makes them invisible to most of the<br/>\n   critters throughout the world.<br/>\n - necros & SKs: they can summon a corpse ... it isn&#39;t cheap,<br/>\n   but before you will loose some &quot;special&quot; items, they can help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I joined a website that lists quests and the levels you can complete <br/>\n&gt; the quests at, the site says you can complete the Stein of Moggok <br/>\n&gt; quest at level 8. I have components to make a Stein of Moggok, have <br/>\n&gt; the book to get another Stein, but when I try to give bartender Clurg <br/>\n&gt; the book, his body guard knocks me on my butt. And I can&#39;t use the <br/>\n&gt; Dark Elf Ill. spell until level 12, so why does everyone say that you <br/>\n&gt; can finish the quest at 8?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>looks like you read many postings of inkies ... ;-)<br/>\nyes, you are right, if you aren&#39;t a dark elf, you have to wait until 12.<br/>\nbut wait ... where is Clurg now? the trolls had to leave their home<br/>\ntome and have to stay in neriak now ... %-&<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are there any other quests that low-level Enchantress&#39;s can do to get <br/>\n&gt; nice equipment, money and experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my chantress is sort of an extra rare played alt. i don&#39;t know how i raised<br/>\nher to 40. i never had to care about money with her, because she is pretty<br/>\nmuch sponsored by my main... i started some quests with her, which i found<br/>\nat <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</a> , but she got help from my main most<br/>\nof the time. sorry, i can&#39;t help you much here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck<br/>\n  - bilt<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik, lvl 57 gnome magician, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
