Not<br/>\nas stable as 2000 and not compatible with alot of software.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not had any problems with compatible softwares. Compatible mode has<br/>\nsolved those problems that i used to have. Then again, i don&#39;t run any 16<br/>\nbit applications.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;and you have to go into regedit and edit Permissions to allow yourself to<br/>\ninstall software<br/>\non it. It is a real biyatch sometimes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWrong, use your admin account to install softwares. It&#39;s much better<br/>\nsecurity to have a regular user account wich you use on regular basis and<br/>\nuse the admin account when you are installing new softwares. That way it<br/>\nwill be alot harder for you to fark up your system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good thing to use is system save, use it when you think your system<br/>\nis running well. If you later run into problems you simply load up your<br/>\nsaved system and are fit for fight again.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;maybe that info would be at www.tweakui.com?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it&#39;s a reg hack. Altho, WinXX ain&#39;t designed to handle very much memory<br/>\nbut you can fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Domi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinetly ditch ME. Every techie I have talked to has told me how unstable<br/>\nit is. They say that Win2000 is much more stable. XP is also an option. Not<br/>\nas stable as 2000 and not compatible with alot of software. and you have to<br/>\ngo into regedit and edit Permissions to allow yourself to install software<br/>\non it. It is a real biyatch sometimes.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n   I have  to agree there 2 GB of ram my system can handle 1.5 gb but my<br/>\nOS(win ME) won&#39;t handle that so well by the way SU my Geforce 4 card is also<br/>\n64 MB I couldn&#39;t afford the 128 mb card<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
