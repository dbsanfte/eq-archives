The computer is shared, and getting another one,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-192879872\">Our most current game platform is the N64, but that is my son&#39;s <br/>\nexclusive property and resides in his room.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe computer is shared, and getting another one, and another line (or <br/>\nDSL on a network) is a bit costly for the family right now. So, a <br/>\ngame platform for the TV is just the ticket for when someone else is <br/>\nplaying EQ, or satisfying their email and surfing habit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy Gamecube? Metroid Prime. Love the Metroid franchise. Don&#39;t mind <br/>\nsome of the cute (Mario, StarFox) games, either. Some are quite <br/>\nplayable, and often very good as far as gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wonder how much more money I can scrape together for endless <br/>\ncomputer upgrades. Bottom line comes to at least $1700 to get current <br/>\nwith the specs for EQ, and a little bit ahead as well. I just don&#39;t <br/>\nknow where I can get that money right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a cheaper alternative is the platform system. All things <br/>\nconsidered, upgrades for that every few years will still be cheaper <br/>\nthan the big bucks I need for the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the games, while good, are not the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe up side is that there is much in the EQ world I can continue to <br/>\nexplore and enjoy even without the upgrades. I find the lag in Luclin <br/>\nand POP to be a bit anoying, but acceptable for all but heavy combat. <br/>\nMy son will do battle even with the lag, but I avoid it. I find the <br/>\nlag to be too distracting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can quest there, use the bazaar, and transport system for my non-<br/>\ndruid alts. Plus, I have only just begun in Velious. Still lots to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay just get lucky with a lottery ticket one day. Then a nice botique <br/>\nmachine would be mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case I don&#39;t get back on before the big day, Merry Christmas and <br/>\nHappy Holidays to all. I really appreciate the EQ community, and this <br/>\ngroup in particular. <br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
