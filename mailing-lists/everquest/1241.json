He waited until I was dead (and the mob was half dead) before\n<br>attacking. When I respawned before he finished it off, he disbanded me so he\n<br>would get all the xp. It really sucked.\n<br>The kid shouldn&#39;t have been playing.\n<br>I guess if the kids are supervised and know how to behave its ok.\n<br>luv,\n<br>-Su</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br>\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\"><b><i>\n<br>\n<br></i></b></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
