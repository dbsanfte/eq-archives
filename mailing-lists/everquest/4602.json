I have a lvl 26 mage on Rallos, and no matter<br/>\n&gt; how hard i try, I cant seem to get past this lvl.  I<br/>\n&gt; have been in full groups killing reds in FV for<br/>\n&gt; hours and still only gotten like half a bub of xp,<br/>\n&gt; and all the others in my group were around teh same<br/>\n&gt; lvl.  I have tried soloing and still nothing.  I am<br/>\n&gt; curious waht I should do, because I lvled really<br/>\n&gt; quick until 24 and it took me about teh same amount<br/>\n&gt; of time to get to 24 as it did to get from 24 to 26.<br/>\n&gt;  I am about done with it because I cant seem to go<br/>\n&gt; anywhere with her.  I started a druid on another<br/>\n&gt; server and have been playing that, but if i CAN find<br/>\n&gt; a way to lvl up my mage, Id liek to.  Thanks in<br/>\n&gt; advance for all your help.<br/>\n&gt; Kittin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Get Paid...
