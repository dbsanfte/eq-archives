Corruption is a new effect that came out with the TSS <br/>\n&gt;expansion.  On your inventory it is listed as one of your resists and like <br/>\n&gt;your other resists has to be raised to become more effective.  In the <br/>\n&gt;older zones it likely will not matter but in the new zones the higher your <br/>\n&gt;corruption resist the more likely you will be to resist the effect when <br/>\n&gt;you do encounter it.  No fear however, if you do become corrupted several <br/>\n&gt;classes have also been given new spells with the TSS expansion that cure <br/>\n&gt;corruption such as the druids, shamans & clerics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Silverminx 74 Druid<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane Server<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah!
