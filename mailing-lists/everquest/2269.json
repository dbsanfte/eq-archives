One in particular looked good for my druid.<br/>\n&gt; A nice drop in Luclin. I investigated the journey and the target<br/>\n&gt; creature, and it looked quite do-able for my character. However, I<br/>\n&gt; was confused by the review on AllaKhazam stating that the recommended<br/>\n&gt; level to attain was 50. I am lvl 30, and the npc doing the drop is 25-<br/>\n&gt; 25. The journey, though long, is not particularly difficult, at least<br/>\n&gt; from what the maps and bestiary information indicate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Am I missing something about these recommended levels on the<br/>\n&gt; AllaKhazam reviews?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nHaving been to Luclin the reasoning is that alot of the creatures undercon.<br/>\nI was reading about a single mob that was about lvl 35 that was killing<br/>\nGROUPS of lvl 50+<br/>\nI found that the green cons were resisting my spells and hitting alot harder<br/>\nand faster than they should have. also, in some places (particularly echo<br/>\ncaverns) there are plants that are not npcs. They are more like traps. they<br/>\ncan root you and kill you but you cannot attack them.<br/>\nI think they really need to work on the lvl info on the mobs in luclin.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
