It<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt;   not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   No problem. All of us were newbies once.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or<br/>\n&gt; Loot my corpse? The book<br/>\n&gt;   says no but I beg to differ.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Is it possible that I had two corpses out there?<br/>\n&gt; Meaning, When I went<br/>\n&gt; back<br/>\n&gt;   with a dead body I died again?  &gt;Which meant I<br/>\n&gt; found the wrong corpse?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   You must have found the second corpse. It can be<br/>\n&gt; tough sometimes getting<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;   right corpse if you die more than once. And<br/>\n&gt; sometimes if you don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; any<br/>\n&gt;   items other than foraged food, you lose the<br/>\n&gt; foraged stuff anyways and just<br/>\n&gt;   get back the food you started with. Up to level 5<br/>\n&gt; I think you get your<br/>\n&gt;   food/drink and tome of discord back. I think your<br/>\n&gt; starting weapon too.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now?<br/>\n&gt; seeing as I have no<br/>\n&gt; food,<br/>\n&gt;   no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I &gt;beg or do I start<br/>\n&gt; another char?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;This game is totally fun but with the fact of<br/>\n&gt; trying to learn which way<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;   go all the time and dying, it is starting &gt;to get<br/>\n&gt; to me,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to<br/>\n&gt; this board since the<br/>\n&gt; Chat<br/>\n&gt;   from the game options was &gt;USELESS.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Well, if it bugs you that much, you can start over<br/>\n&gt; again. But even if you<br/>\n&gt;   lose everything, at that low level you can just<br/>\n&gt; keep the character and<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt;   build your items and such back up again. I<br/>\n&gt; recommend that you not carry<br/>\n&gt;   anything you really don&#39;t want to lose until you<br/>\n&gt; get level 6. Keep<br/>\n&gt;   everything else in the bank. Especially your<br/>\n&gt; money. Oh, and practice<br/>\n&gt;   foraging alot. It will help you later on in the<br/>\n&gt; game. Trust me. Begging is<br/>\n&gt;   not a good idea. Begging tend to piss people off.<br/>\n&gt; And you might want to<br/>\n&gt;   avoid orc camps at that level. at least stay close<br/>\n&gt; to the lift with a good<br/>\n&gt;   group and have someone to pull wandering orc<br/>\n&gt; cents. I think even some orc<br/>\n&gt;   pawns might give you xp at that level.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Rob<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   You&#39;re welcome.<br/>\n&gt;   luv,<br/>\n&gt;   -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
