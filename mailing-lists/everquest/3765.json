Wish I had it when I started! \n  Anyway for those newbs<br>that are going to start this right now the Orc \n  Fibula is the hard item<br>to get. However if you come across these grab a few \n  of them! I know you<br>need at least three that I can remember. The bandit&#39;s \n  tooth can be<br>bought in Kelethin, unfortunately I don&#39;t remember which \n  vendor has it.<br>Also if you hang around spires you may be able to pick one \n  up after a<br>higher lvl player knocks off a bandit. That&#39;s how I got mine. \n  The<br>fingerbones I&#39;ve found to be relatively common even at Orc hill. \n  The<br>onluy thing is I think it actually depends on the lvl character \n  going<br>for the items. I may be wrong on this but it&#39;s just a guess! \n  :D<br><br>C-ya!<br>Steve<br>Durgaa lvl12 Female Wood Elf \n  Ranger<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>Message: 2<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Date: \n  Tue, 24 Sep 2002 04:07:43 -0400<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From: &quot;WULF Tech&quot; \n  &lt;wulftech@...&gt;<br>Subject: Trueshot Chainmail Ranger Quest \n  armor<br><br>The Trueshot Chainmail armor is a newbie armor quest in Greater \n  Faydark.<br>You can find all this information on Allakhazam and EQrangers, but \n  I<br>offer it here to you just for comprehensive purposes.&nbsp; This armor \n  is<br>wearable by half elves and wood elves, but only if your deity is \n  Tunare.<br>The quest starts out in the ranger guild in Kelethin.&nbsp; Hail \n  Samatansyn<br>Flamecaller to start the quest.&nbsp; He will give you a \n  Trueshot Armor kit<br>which you will use to put specific items in and combine \n  them to make the<br>mold for the armor.&nbsp; Then take the pattern he gives \n  you for the armor<br>piece you wish to create and combine it with the mold you \n  made in a<br>forge.&nbsp; My ranger is level 10 and has not failed on a single \n  piece yet.<br>I just helped a level 1 ranger craft the coif and he succeeded \n  so I<br>don&#39;t believe it takes any smithing skill to finish each item.&nbsp; \n  <br><br>NOTE: Most of the items can be purchased from vendors around Kelethin \n  so<br>before you spend time killing mobs, try buying them first, unless \n  you<br>just want the xp.&nbsp; Some of the orc specific items are No Drop, \n  which<br>I&#39;ll indicate by (ND).&nbsp; The bricks of crude bronze are best \n  purchased<br>off other players, or as I found out you can trade Crushbone \n  belts for<br>them.&nbsp; <br><br><br>BOOTS:&nbsp;&nbsp; (all items \n  purchasable)<br>- 3 bricks crude bronze<br>- 1 severed orc foot<br>- 2 spider \n  legs<br><br>BRACER:&nbsp; (all items purchasable)<br>- 1 brick crude \n  bronze<br>- 1 skeleton tibia<br>- 1 pixie wing<br>- 1 gypsy \n  wine<br><br>COIF:&nbsp; (all items purchasable)<br>- 2 bricks crude \n  bronze<br>- 1 Royal Jelly&nbsp;&nbsp; (drops off giant wasps)<br>- 1 \n  spiderling eye<br>- 1 ration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (NOT Iron \n  Ration)<br><br>GAUNTLETS:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>- 3 bricks crude bronze<br>- 1 Orc \n  Ulna (ND)<br>- 1 Orc Tibia (ND)<br>- 2 Orc Fingerbones (ND&nbsp; Note: These \n  are rare drops)<br><br>LEGPLATES:<br>- 4 bricks crude bronze<br>- 1 Orc \n  Fibula&nbsp; (ND&nbsp; Note: Very rare drop.&nbsp; Drops off Orc Slavers)<br>- \n  1 Orc Clavicle (ND)<br>- 1 Lightstone <br><br>SLEEVES:&nbsp;&nbsp; (all items \n  purchasable except venom sacks)<br>- 2 bricks crude bronze<br>- 2 giant wasp \n  venom sacks<br>- 1 large window abdomen&nbsp; (ND)<br>- 1 white \n  wine<br><br>TUNIC:<br>- 5 bricks crude bronze<br>- 1 Orc fibula (ND very \n  rare)<br>- 1 golden bandit tooth&nbsp;&nbsp; (note: not sure where to obtain \n  this or what<br>it drops from, but I suspect the bandits in NK probably)<br>- \n  1 pristine forest drakeling scale&nbsp; (note: should be purchasable but \n  I<br>haven&#39;t seen one yet)<br>- 1 Orc Ribcage (ND)<br>- 1 Orc Eye (common \n  drop, can also purchase)<br><br><br><br>I suggest doing the gaunts, the legs, \n  and the tunic last since the<br>fibulas will come the hardest.&nbsp; This \n  armor has decent stats and should<br>be good up until mid 20&#39;s.&nbsp; You will \n  have to go to Crushbone for the ND<br>items, but other than that, it&#39;s a \n  simple quest.
