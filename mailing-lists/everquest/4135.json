My cleric was in<br/>\nSK fighting at &quot;KFC&quot; and picked up with three guildmates from a guild named<br/>\n&quot;Seigneurs de la Lune Noire&quot;. It turns out they were all French Canadians<br/>\nfrom Quebec. Two of them spoke very little English, while one of them was<br/>\nfluent in both English and French.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided to dust off my rusty college French (don&#39;t ask how long it&#39;s been)<br/>\nand attempt to communicate with them in their native tongue. I know I made a<br/>\nbunch of grammatical errors, but they seemed to really enjoy my efforts and<br/>\nI know I enjoyed grouping with them and speaking French with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor Oakenbark 48 wood elf druid on Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Steven Hulse&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steveh@...\">steveh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, December 14, 2002 12:50 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] A recent group I was in<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wanted to take a moment and tell you about the recent experience I had<br/>\nin a group over in Lavastorm Mountains.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was just hanging out over there in the entrance to Najena hunting Fire<br/>\nDrakes and such outside. It was good leveling and they dropped some decent<br/>\ncoin for a lower level player. Well I havened to meet up with two Dark Elves<br/>\nfrom Germany. one spoke no english but the other was able to translate for<br/>\nher. They asked me to join their group and I did. I have to say that was one<br/>\nof the funnest groups I have ever been in! I&#39;m kind of a communications buff<br/>\nso it was very fun for me to watch and read the chat between them. It was<br/>\nalso a good opportunity for me to maybe pick up a few new words!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; C-ya!<br/>\n&gt; Durgaa<br/>\n&gt; Shizney<br/>\n&gt; Genmay<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\n&gt; Steven R.
