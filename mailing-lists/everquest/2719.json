IMHO the verant people can do and they<br/>\nshould really start to work on building up a better gfx engine.<br/>\ni mean it is just crazy to demand from the users to use P4s and<br/>\ngeforce 4 cards, when others can do superb gfx with P2/P3 based<br/>\nsystems and a TNT2 or geforce 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhave fun<br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik<br/>\nlevel 52 female gnome magician<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
