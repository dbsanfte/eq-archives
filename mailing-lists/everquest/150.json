This may be an interesting subject for thieves with lockpicking to<br/>\nexplore. Also I was wondering of any quests in highpass. Lasty has anyone been<br/>\ndown into the dungeon area of highkeep? The first sentry monster I conned was red<br/>\nto a 17th level character. This is the area past the man that sell smithing raw<br/>\nmaterials down near the bank, not in the prison area however. Also If you are of<br/>\ngood alignment don&#39;t talk to prisoners they will kill on talk and they can leave<br/>\nthere cells and gaurds will not kill them. They are similar in look to the madmen<br/>\nof RO. Oh, and has anyone gambled at the 100pp minumum table in the casino in<br/>\nhighkeep?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nmithe of cathic-thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
