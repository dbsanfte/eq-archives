Even as SOEs major flagship game, SOE \n  is seeing <br>the darkness at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; They will be \n  spending more <br>money to maintain the game than they are bringing in with \n  <br>subscriptions dropping more and more each month.&nbsp; I think SOE &quot;may&quot; \n  <br>try to revitilize EQ by releasing a completely new graphics engine <br>and \n  serious upgrade for the game, but this would be optional and only <br>be \n  window dressing since there is not too much they can do with the <br>backend \n  servers without a complete game overhaul, which they just are <br>not going to \n  do.&nbsp; EQ2 was a serious disapointment to them, as the <br>players were \n  already use to EQ1 and the social structure there.&nbsp; It <br>does sadden me \n  a bit that EQ will come to a close, but we all knew it <br>would happen \n  eventually.&nbsp; I doubt SOE will ever cancel EQ completely <br>(at least not \n  for another 5 or so years), but I would imagine the day <br>when new expansion \n  are no longer released, patches are no longer <br>made, and maybe one or two \n  servers are all that are left is not too <br>far around the corner.... like I \n  said, maybe 2 years.<br><br>I doubt there will ever be another game that has \n  the same appeal and <br>drive that SOE captured with EQ1... however I think we \n  might find <br>that another game may come close only after SOE &quot;pulls the \n  plug&quot; on <br>EQ1 and forces everyone to find another game.&nbsp; We may see a \n  game in <br>the future released from SOE along the same genre of EverQuest, \n  but <br>with a completely different story line and perhaps even the same \n  <br>stayability of EverQuest, but I rather doubt it.&nbsp; I think SOE will \n  <br>end up making their bread and butter with shoot-offs of the Star Wars \n  <br>Universe and maybe some other games like they offer on the station \n  <br>website (jeopardy, wheel of fortune, etc), while another game company \n  <br>with the same spirit that SOE had long ago steps up to take the \n  <br>lead.&nbsp; I would say the next big game will be Vanguard : Saga of \n  <br>Heros.&nbsp; I think that Brad and Jeff have both learned a lot from their \n  <br>experience helping shape EverQuest, and Microsoft (one of the biggest \n  <br>backers of Sigil) has learned from its mistakes in the online game \n  <br>field and won&#39;t make the same mistakes again.&nbsp; SOE has started \n  <br>loosing its grip on the market and Microsoft has a habit of stepping \n  <br>in and taking over when something like that happens.&nbsp; I mean look at \n  <br>Nintendo, Sega, and even Sony.&nbsp; They started slipping in the console \n  <br>game industry and Microsoft stepped in with the X-Box and dominated \n  <br>the market by throwing money at the market till they owned it.&nbsp; Now \n  <br>the best graphics for console games out there are on X-Box, even if \n  <br>content is still split evenly but leaning more towards X-Box as time \n  <br>goes on.<br><br>Matt<br>aka Dragowulf Bowcraft (Ranger of The \n  Tribunal)<br>Dulcere the Furryfooted Ranger (Retired Guide of Erollisi \n  Marr)<br><br>--- In EverQuest@yahoogroups.com, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt;
