I&#39;d suggest making \n  them in a different color, possibly contrasting it with the background.&nbsp; \n  For example, if the background is light, use a dark font color, and vice \n  versa. That was really the main thing.&nbsp; The other thing I wondered is if \n  it were possibly to import MPEG video into Flash, Here was my thought:&nbsp; I \n  have a video card with a TV out.&nbsp; I could easily play EverQuest while \n  connected to a standard TV and use a VCR to record the game play.&nbsp; Then I \n  have a video capture card with a video in port.&nbsp; I could then connect the \n  VCR to that and capture what I had recorded from EverQuest and save it as an \n  MPEG file.&nbsp; Then, if Flash can import MPEG files, maybe you could then \n  syncronize the music to the video so you get some &quot;live&quot; action fight scenes \n  in it.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I have never used Flash before so I don&#39;t know if \n  it can be done.&nbsp; However, I have a few friends that do use it so I will \n  ask them and get back to you.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">But that&#39;d be my thoughts.&nbsp; Otherwise, it&#39;s \n  very kickass and stuff!</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric Rennison</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
