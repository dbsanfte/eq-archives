We have alot of fun.<br/>\nGuild had really come in handy when I needed help. And sometimes it&#39;s just<br/>\nnice to talk to people.<br/>\nWe sometimes go to places and help newbies as a group. It&#39;s fun.<br/>\nI saw one guild in CB the other day just handing out stuff to newbies.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The only real experience I&#39;ve had with a guild is the one I was in when I<br/>\n&gt; was first getting started. We never did very much, since two poeple in it<br/>\n&gt; shared a computer, but alas, it was dibanded for having too few members. I<br/>\n&gt; have thought about joining a guild, but havn&#39;t run into anyone interested<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; taking me in, nor have I really advertised that I&#39;m looking for one<br/>\n </span></blockquote>either.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; These days, when I am not battling the scourge of Norrath, I hang around<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Qeynos area helping those with less experience than myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Damasciss Kyndhart<br/>\n&gt; Driud of the 24th Season<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 6<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Sat, 12 Jan 2002 14:57:14 -0600<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Guild Stolen!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry to hear that.

Then it popped up again so I clicked YES just to make it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stop popping up. At that point I was so new to the game I really didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand what a guild was. Anyways, I made some good friends and was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; having fun. But I noticed less and less of my friends were on.. I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>started<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; thinking about leaving. But my favorite person in the guild was a guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; officer and I didn&#39;t want to abandon her. Then I ran into my favorite<br/>\n&gt; person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the guild and she was in a different guild. I asked what happened and<br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; said that there had been some bickering amongst some of the leading<br/>\n&gt; members.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She was very nice to me as always. Later on I was still thinking of<br/>\n&gt; leaving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but was having fun conversations with the guild leaders. But the very<br/>\n </span></blockquote>next<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; day I mentioned my favorite person and that I was sorry she left the<br/>\n&gt; guild.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They started trashtalking her. I told them that I had really enjoyed the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild because of her. Then they told me the only reason I was still in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; guild was bc none of the officers were in the same zone with me to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>disband<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; me. they started trashtalking me and claimed that I had badmouthed the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild. What had really happened was someone asked me how I liked the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>guild<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; and I said I liked it fine. I said it was cool. I happened to add that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thought another guild was cool too. I didn&#39;t say it was better or<br/>\n&gt; anything,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just that they were both cool. So that person reported to my<br/>\n </span></blockquote>guildleaders<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; that I badmouthed the guild. See, I had an alt in the other guild. I<br/>\n&gt; figured<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bc they are different characters it didnt&#39; really matter. After<br/>\n&gt; badmouthing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me the guild leaders told me I had a choice: I could leave the guild or<br/>\n&gt; take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my alts out of the other guild. I told them that it was really sad bc<br/>\n </span></blockquote>we&#39;d<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; been friends the day before. But they were being so pissy. so I asked<br/>\n </span></blockquote>them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; how I could disband myself from the guild. and I did it right then. I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>went<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; straight to the other guild and they invited me in right away.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s sad how guilds can be so fickle.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, it can happen to you!  A few days ago, my hubby was having fun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with some guildmates when POOF! the guild was no more.  Took some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; figuring out but apparently the person that originally started the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guild and was tagged as the &#39;owner&#39; wanted to make a new guild but was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unable because she was still listed as owning Circle of Majik.  She<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had been forced out of the guild about a year ago because of her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thievery and lying.  She was unwelcome with the current leadership of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gawabiwa and could not get control except by force.  She went to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Verant and had her leader powers reinstated then promptly dropped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone out of the guild without any kind of warning.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What a dirty underhanded thing to do!  She didn&#39;t have to drop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone! or even anyone!  She could have come in and told everyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before hand, instead she had to yank it out from under us.  It hurt us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the core, but Gawabiwa has built a close knit guild and we are not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our name.  We will rebuild our guild and get ourselves back on track.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  We won&#39;t be having anything to do with whatever guild she has whether<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; called Circle of Majik or not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We have lots of support too.
