It happens, not much you can do about it<br/>\nwhen things go bad, and fleeing isnt an option mostly where i play.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust live with death, for me 90% of the time i get a ress within 10 min and<br/>\nthe rest is corpse summon and ress. Life in earlier stages varies depending<br/>\non how hard it is to get ress or if you care at all. When I grew up resses<br/>\nwerent an option most of the time as there were no clerics that could ress<br/>\nat all, nowadays you can find one without looking too hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you never die you would never be careful either, it has to be ups and<br/>\ndowns to be fun imo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 16, 2002 1:11 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Gaming Death<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely hate game death and try to avoid it whenever possible. I let<br/>\npeople know right off that if I think I am going to get killed I will flee.<br/>\nA dead cleric isn&#39;t very helpful. Especially since I only have a 21.6k<br/>\nconnection and we&#39;re talking about waiting 5 or more minutes to reload from<br/>\ndeath. When my mother is playing also, my zoning like that can cause her to<br/>\nlag very badly. If she has to zone or gets killed then one or both of us get<br/>\nbooted offline. And I lose alot of xp. So that isn&#39;t fun.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings toward game<br/>\n&gt; death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s attitudes<br/>\n&gt; toward game death?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on<br/>\n&gt; since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in<br/>\n&gt; awkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t just<br/>\n&gt; call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor do<br/>\n&gt; have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big<br/>\n&gt; nasty.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the<br/>\n&gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all<br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server. He<br/>\n&gt; is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and tactics<br/>\n&gt; and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the<br/>\n&gt; Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but enjoy<br/>\n&gt; my independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career as<br/>\n&gt; possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
