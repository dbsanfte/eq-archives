I \nam not a very good EQ player. I would consider myself ultra&nbsp;competent in \ngroup battles, but in other aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I have \nnever gotten a character past level 40. My first character was an Erudite \nEnchanter by the name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to level 40 after \ntwo years or so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which was my friends \ncharacter but I own it. I just started playing again after giving up on the game \nand playing DAOC. Eventually I gave up all MMORPGS deciding they were a waste of \ntime. About a week ago, I decided to give EQ another chance and have decided \nthat it has improved a great deal. I am now playing a Human Ranger who is level \n30. I really like the character. His buffs and damage spells are great. I guess \nI could use some help on how to be a good EQ player. I have been playing for \nabout two years and I feel like I know absolutely nothing about the game. I have \nnever belonged to a good guild or anything. I play on the Xegony server. \n</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
