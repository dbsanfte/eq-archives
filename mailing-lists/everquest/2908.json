My friend is a level 17 druid and<br/>\n&gt; a tailor.  He can&#39;t make armor that my level 13 Ranger<br/>\n&gt; can use that is worthwhile to me.

But<br/>\npottery is, by far, the easiest skill to master, so I really wouldn&#39;t worry<br/>\nabout it at this point.  I mastered pottery to skill 122 in about 2 hours<br/>\nwith 25pp making (and destroying) unfired medium bowls.  Many of the higher<br/>\nlevel guild are now starting to make getting pottery to 122 a requirement<br/>\njust for these potions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wish to do the Coldain shawl quests, then you will need to spend<br/>\nlarge amounts of time (and plat) to get most tradeskills up to a significant<br/>\nlevel.  There are also some rumors that tradeskills will end up being a<br/>\nlarger part of the new expansion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Ranger, you should work on mastering Fletching, especially if you ever<br/>\nwant to make the Trueshot Longbow or make your own arrows.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on how popular the new cultural armor becomes, smithing could be a<br/>\ndecent money maker at very high levels.  Some of the new cultural plate is<br/>\nreally nice (of course, there is no Karana specific chain for Rangers, just<br/>\nthe regular human cultural  :(  ).<br/>\n<br/>\nBrewing and baking could be nice with all of the stat bonus food available.<br/>\nSome of the newer recipes have some nice stats on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nErik Johnson</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
