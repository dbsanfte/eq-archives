While the <br/>\nPoP portal system makes travel much easier, at your level, SoL offers much more <br/>\nto your character than either of the other 2.  The SoL port system is slower, <br/>\nbut you get a number of new zones to hunt in and the Bazaar, which is very <br/>\nuseful to lower level chars looking for decently priced gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSulamwen<br/>\nWarder of &lt;Fate&#39;s Forge&gt;<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
