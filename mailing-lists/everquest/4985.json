Like say if you were a ogre warrior and you didn&#39;t like the way<br/>\n&gt; your helmet looked like, well you could go down to a forge or blacksmith<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; pay a certain amount to have them mold the helmet anyway you would<br/>\n&gt; like..maybe you would like horns on the helmet or a certain design ecthed<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; it..and for casters you could go to a tailor somewhere and have them<br/>\ndesign<br/>\n&gt; your robe a certain way..maybe you would like longer sleeves or a slit in<br/>\n&gt; your robe or a fancy collar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
