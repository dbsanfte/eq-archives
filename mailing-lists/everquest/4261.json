After that, the owner and I <br/>\n&gt; have made some-what of a friendship and I decided to give the group <br/>\n&gt; another try. It is, after all, the only decent EverQuest group at <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo! and I was disappointed that I had to leave in the first <br/>\n&gt; place. So, I&#39;m glad to be back.
