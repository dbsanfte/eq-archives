I&#39;m having a hard time finding supplies for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; no, there isn&#39;t a real guide on tailoring, yet, but you don&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; need a special guide on that, because just have a look at eqtraders,<br/>\n&gt; check the recipes and trade supplies sections. try to find something<br/>\n&gt; with components that are easy to get, and are 10 to 50 above your<br/>\n&gt; current skill. most of the time you will end up doing cured silk (up<br/>\n&gt; to 82 i think) and wu&#39;s armor afterwards (that&#39;s up to 158).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; then put on your INT (for learning skills faster) and WIS (reducing<br/>\n&gt; failures) gear. why to reduce failures with the WIS gear, to get back<br/>\n&gt; some of the expenses you have. maybe add some CHA buffs as well, and<br/>\n&gt; sell in a town where they like you ... ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; also try to find things that are stackable (components or results)<br/>\n&gt; because you can do more in a given time if you don&#39;t have to sell<br/>\n&gt; things to a merchant every four pieces you made. if you need<br/>\n&gt; components from different vendors, try to find a town (or place)<br/>\n&gt; where such merchants are close to each other.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; also check out the new recipes that were added with the last patch,<br/>\n&gt; there are much more things to choose from ... main problem with the<br/>\n&gt; new ones: not all trivals are listed/known, yet, but you can make<br/>\n&gt; others happy if you find &quot;unknown&quot; trivals and post them on eqtraders.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; another thing: don&#39;t even think about pieces that need a 200 skill.<br/>\n&gt; those recipes need rare drop or very expensive components. and this<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t good to raise a tradeskill in a short time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Biltilie Dwimmerlaik<br/>\n&gt; level 53 female gnome magician (no, the 53 isn&#39;t a typo :)<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
