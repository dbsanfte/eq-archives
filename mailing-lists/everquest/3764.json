However","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1400804110\">This is great info! Wish I had it when I started! Anyway for those newbs<br/>\nthat are going to start this right now the Orc Fibula is the hard item<br/>\nto get. However if you come across these grab a few of them! I know you<br/>\nneed at least three that I can remember. The bandit&#39;s tooth can be<br/>\nbought in Kelethin, unfortunately I don&#39;t remember which vendor has it.<br/>\nAlso if you hang around spires you may be able to pick one up after a<br/>\nhigher lvl player knocks off a bandit. That&#39;s how I got mine. The<br/>\nfingerbones I&#39;ve found to be relatively common even at Orc hill. The<br/>\nonluy thing is I think it actually depends on the lvl character going<br/>\nfor the items. I may be wrong on this but it&#39;s just a guess! :D<br/>\n<br/>\nC-ya!<br/>\nSteve<br/>\nDurgaa lvl12 Female Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n Message: 2<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2002 04:07:43 -0400<br/>\n   From: &quot;WULF Tech&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Trueshot Chainmail Ranger Quest armor<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Trueshot Chainmail armor is a newbie armor quest in Greater Faydark.<br/>\nYou can find all this information on Allakhazam and EQrangers, but I<br/>\noffer it here to you just for comprehensive purposes.  This armor is<br/>\nwearable by half elves and wood elves, but only if your deity is Tunare.<br/>\nThe quest starts out in the ranger guild in Kelethin.  Hail Samatansyn<br/>\nFlamecaller to start the quest.  He will give you a Trueshot Armor kit<br/>\nwhich you will use to put specific items in and combine them to make the<br/>\nmold for the armor.  Then take the pattern he gives you for the armor<br/>\npiece you wish to create and combine it with the mold you made in a<br/>\nforge.  My ranger is level 10 and has not failed on a single piece yet.<br/>\nI just helped a level 1 ranger craft the coif and he succeeded so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t believe it takes any smithing skill to finish each item.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: Most of the items can be purchased from vendors around Kelethin so<br/>\nbefore you spend time killing mobs, try buying them first, unless you<br/>\njust want the xp.  Some of the orc specific items are No Drop, which<br/>\nI&#39;ll indicate by (ND).  The bricks of crude bronze are best purchased<br/>\noff other players, or as I found out you can trade Crushbone belts for<br/>\nthem.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBOOTS:   (all items purchasable)<br/>\n- 3 bricks crude bronze<br/>\n- 1 severed orc foot<br/>\n- 2 spider legs<br/>\n<br/>\nBRACER:  (all items purchasable)<br/>\n- 1 brick crude bronze<br/>\n- 1 skeleton tibia<br/>\n- 1 pixie wing<br/>\n- 1 gypsy wine<br/>\n<br/>\nCOIF:  (all items purchasable)<br/>\n- 2 bricks crude bronze<br/>\n- 1 Royal Jelly   (drops off giant wasps)<br/>\n- 1 spiderling eye<br/>\n- 1 ration    (NOT Iron Ration)<br/>\n<br/>\nGAUNTLETS:   <br/>\n- 3 bricks crude bronze<br/>\n- 1 Orc Ulna (ND)<br/>\n- 1 Orc Tibia (ND)<br/>\n- 2 Orc Fingerbones (ND  Note: These are rare drops)<br/>\n<br/>\nLEGPLATES:<br/>\n- 4 bricks crude bronze<br/>\n- 1 Orc Fibula  (ND  Note: Very rare drop.  Drops off Orc Slavers)<br/>\n- 1 Orc Clavicle (ND)<br/>\n- 1 Lightstone <br/>\n<br/>\nSLEEVES:   (all items purchasable except venom sacks)<br/>\n- 2 bricks crude bronze<br/>\n- 2 giant wasp venom sacks<br/>\n- 1 large window abdomen  (ND)<br/>\n- 1 white wine<br/>\n<br/>\nTUNIC:<br/>\n- 5 bricks crude bronze<br/>\n- 1 Orc fibula (ND very rare)<br/>\n- 1 golden bandit tooth   (note: not sure where to obtain this or what<br/>\nit drops from, but I suspect the bandits in NK probably)<br/>\n- 1 pristine forest drakeling scale  (note: should be purchasable but I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t seen one yet)<br/>\n- 1 Orc Ribcage (ND)<br/>\n- 1 Orc Eye (common drop, can also purchase)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest doing the gaunts, the legs, and the tunic last since the<br/>\nfibulas will come the hardest.  This armor has decent stats and should<br/>\nbe good up until mid 20&#39;s.  You will have to go to Crushbone for the ND<br/>\nitems, but other than that, it&#39;s a simple quest. You can check out the<br/>\nstats on Allakhazam.  It&#39;s nice looking armor too.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAirbourne Ranger<br/>\nLvl 10 ELF RNG<br/>\nE&#39;ci server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
