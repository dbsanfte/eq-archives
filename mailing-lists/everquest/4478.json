That&#39;s not the case, most meleers seems to forget that they do get \n  their upgrades in form of weapons. If you didn&#39;t think your gear did a huge \n  impact it&#39;s time to think again and start checking how to exp while gaining as \n  good gear as possible during your lower levels. Check safehouse as someone \n  else mentioned, that forum has all the info you need (don&#39;t forget the search \n  function, people can get somewhat irritated on new people asking questions \n  that has been asked 100 times in the past few days =P).</font></span></div>\n  <div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1211421552312201707-20032003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1211421552312201707-20032003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\">-domi</font></span></div>\n  <blockquote>\n    <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1211421552OutlookMessageHeader\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"\n size=\"2\">-----Original Message-----<br><b>From:</b> Wulfric Rennison \n    [mailto:wulftech@...]<br><b>Sent:</b> den 19 mars 2003 \n    23:30<br><b>To:</b> EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] \n    Playing a rogue<br><br></font></div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Perhaps you people can help me.&nbsp; This is \n    something I&#39;ve pondered for awhile.</font></div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">My rogue is level 32.&nbsp; I play him \n    infrequently.&nbsp; At level 30 rogues get all the skills they are going to \n    get.&nbsp; Rogues are non-casters so they don&#39;t have new spells to look \n    forward to.&nbsp; The only things rogues have to look forward to are their \n    disciplines at level 50.&nbsp; So how does one get from level 30 to level 50 \n    in the shortest amount of time possible?&nbsp; Whenever I play, it seems \n    like I always have a hard time finding a group.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking in places \n    like Frontier Mountains, The Overthere, and Dawnshroud Peaks.&nbsp; I&#39;m not \n    high enough level that I can easily solo any mobs in either of those zones. \n    But nobody seems to want to group.&nbsp; So are there any zones where I can \n    get quick xp by soloing?&nbsp; Or are there other zones I could try for \n    groups?&nbsp; </font></div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I hate for my rogue to fall by the way side \n    because he&#39;s become a bore to play.&nbsp; So any suggestions you have for \n    playing rogue characters to help me out would be appreciated.</font></div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Thanks in advance.</font></div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric Rennison</font></div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">32 Half Elf Rogue</font></div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Cazic Thule \n    server</font></div><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n    use of Yahoo!
