You can Solo with different chars not all are<br/>\ndesigned for this. You can always find someone to play<br/>\nwith usually.  10-15 hours per week is fine, Trust me,<br/>\nif you can find the time, this will<br/>\nincrease....heheheh<br/>\n   HOW IT WORKS - well you make a char and set out for<br/>\nadventure , there are lots of quests but get out and<br/>\nkill BADDIES.....Like I said, you can solo but you<br/>\nwill group and want to for certain things. Sometimes I<br/>\njust like to jump on and Fletch arrows, so I sit in a<br/>\ntown and Craft away.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  YES IT IS<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  I have a P2 500 with 316 MB RAM and a 32MB card I<br/>\nrun the EQ trilogy and it runs ok, yours will be fine.<br/>\n Don&#39;t get LUCLIN since the system will run slow. I<br/>\nhave put it on mine and can play but it is TOO slow<br/>\nfor my liking.  The trilogy gives you enough zones and<br/>\nequipment to keep you busy for a while. There is<br/>\nplenty to do and see. NORRATH is HUGE.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Already touched this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nMOST OF all, ENJOY, and trust me you will, it is a<br/>\nBLAST.<br/>\n<br/>\nLET US KNOW what server you choose to play on, <br/>\n<br/>\nI play on Druzzil RO<br/>\n<br/>\nLater<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n--- quiller64 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jflip64@...\">jflip64@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi all, <br/>\n&gt; Having been a fan of computer RPG&#39;s for years I am<br/>\n&gt; considering trying <br/>\n&gt; EQ. Having never played an online rpg before I have<br/>\n&gt; a few questions ?<br/>\n&gt; (Forgive my lack of knowledge and feel free to laugh<br/>\n&gt; at my questions)<br/>\n&gt; 1. Being used to playing solo games I could pretty<br/>\n&gt; much play at my <br/>\n&gt; own pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other<br/>\n&gt; online players but <br/>\n&gt; seeing as I am a casual gamer i only spend  10-15<br/>\n&gt; hours a week gaming <br/>\n&gt; is this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play<br/>\n&gt; occurs with whoever <br/>\n&gt; is online at the time and am I not tied into a<br/>\n&gt; specific group/times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join<br/>\n&gt; with? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kharnak,<br/>\n&gt; etc) does it <br/>\n&gt; matter which one I start with or are the later<br/>\n&gt; addons geared for <br/>\n&gt; higher level characters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the<br/>\n&gt; system requirements <br/>\n&gt; but what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866,<br/>\n&gt; 128sdram, 32mb ddr nvidia <br/>\n&gt; geforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or<br/>\n&gt; should I wait <br/>\n&gt; till I upgrade.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any feedback <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo!
