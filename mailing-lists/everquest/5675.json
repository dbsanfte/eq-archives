Following instruction JUST AS THEY SAY.. I downloaded, <br/>\nburned to cds and then copied over the folder.. when I run the <br/>\neverquest.exe it check for files in folder and found disrepancy in <br/>\neverquest.exe and testeverquest.exe GRR seems like the executable <br/>\nfiles for dial-up and cable connection are different or somehow its <br/>\nlogged to a specific IP add.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrowsing through the everquest.log file and then getting help from <br/>\nsome friends at forum.. I just run the eqgame.exe with patchme <br/>\nbehind it, to &quot;trick&quot; the game into NOT patching.. WOW I manage to <br/>\nlog in.. even chat with GM in the chat board inside, grr no help <br/>\ncoming from the grumpy GM too.. I tried clicking PLAY button, <br/>\nconnected in SUPER FAST speed.. u know, that Firiona Vie loading <br/>\nscreen, that has loading froglock under it (saw some funny msg <br/>\nthere, about fippy and anyone ever read this msg jokes).. took about <br/>\n2-4seconds to load the world, and the NEW chars models looks great, <br/>\nsomehow ALL my chars look different, erudite looks so tall and bald, <br/>\nmy high elf female cleric looks strange, like a bronze amazon, when <br/>\nI recalled she looks like Firiona Vie 3 years ago.. sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nClicking on any of the characters.. of course crash me back, giving <br/>\nbit failed error something msg. Now, I am trying to download the <br/>\neverquest.exe and testeverquest.exe and whatever various files they <br/>\nr throwing at me, since I had manage to download 2.7gig already at <br/>\nthe cable company. Good luck to me.. camping mobs didnt cost me so <br/>\nmuch time and money, GRR!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
