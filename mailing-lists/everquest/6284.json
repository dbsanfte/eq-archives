Your old account <br/>\nmay still be there. I was OOG for about 2 years and was sure my toons <br/>\nwere wiped out but when I paid my dues and logged in I was pleasantly <br/>\nsuprised to see my beautiful Rangerette still there! I too only had EQ <br/>\nand the Kunark expan but I decided to get the Platinum pack simply <br/>\nbecause if I went and bought all the expansions seperately it would have <br/>\ncost me well over $150! The Platinum pack was only $30 (at a local <br/>\nWal*Mart) which gave me EQ, Kunark, Scars, PoP, LoY, and LDoN plus I got <br/>\na cool little freebie, 10 mana and health potions that are usuable with <br/>\nthe new Potion belt feature. I also picked up the DoN expansion as well <br/>\nsimply for the guild management options. Currently there are two other <br/>\nexpansions I don&#39;t have which are Omens of War and the new one &quot;Depths <br/>\nof Darkhollow&quot; (which I don&#39;t think is even available quite yet.) but <br/>\nthen again, my highest toon is only 45 so OoW won&#39;t do me any good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to get all the expans but only a couple then I highly <br/>\nsuggest PoP and LDoN. LDoNs are a real blast. curerently my guild is <br/>\ndoing them every other weekend just for fun and for all of us to get <br/>\ntogether (Well, what few of us there are) and do something as a guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nhope this helps!<br/>\nDurgaa<br/>\nGuild Leader of Mystic Crusaders<br/>\nBristlebane server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;There are 2 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Topics in this digest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      1.

There has been so many changes to the game since those two expansions that  you&#39;d invariably have a very difficult time trying to level and get better gear.  Sure you could still find places to level, but it would take you longer and you&#39;d be missing out on A LOT of great enhancements.  I&#39;d highly reccomend if you&#39;re gonna get back into it to spend $30 and buy whatever bundle pack is available with all the expansions.   Since Luclin there has been Planes of Power, Legacy of Ykesha, Lost Dungeons of Norrath, Omens of War, Dragons of Norrath, and a 9th one which I am forgetting.   I really think each expansion definitely offers something that makes the expansion worth getting.  So good luck in whatever you decide to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wulfric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;  From: dwmitch <br/>\n&gt;  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;  Sent: Friday, July 22, 2005 7:03 PM<br/>\n&gt;  Subject: [EverQuest] I&#39;m considering taking the game back up, but I have a question first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Three years ago I played using the Kunark and Luclin expansions.
