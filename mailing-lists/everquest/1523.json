Wow, you have it easy. $50 a month is how much they charge for<br/>\nregular 56K connection where I live. (don&#39;t worry, we get a special military<br/>\ndiscount so it&#39;s not quite that much). DSL costs well over $100. Probably<br/>\nover $200 just to set it up. Well, that&#39;s here anyways.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I am running on an Emachine. Choose it because it was effectively<br/>\n&gt; free, after rebates. My wife likes AOL, and the Compuserve deal was<br/>\n&gt; good for us. Compuserve IS AOL, in every practical way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Added memory and a NVidia card with 32 meg. EQ runs alright. Now that<br/>\n&gt; I am learning more about game machines, I am planning on an Alien for<br/>\n&gt; my next computer. However, I think that this one will work well<br/>\n&gt; enough for a year or two. I am sure I will know just when the change<br/>\n&gt; over must take place. Somewhere where frustration vs available money<br/>\n&gt; cross each other on the performance chart.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Emachine needs to be rebooted whenever the game has been played,<br/>\n&gt; but while in the game I have no performance problems that seem<br/>\n&gt; excessive or unreasonable for a mid-level system. Compuserve is not<br/>\n&gt; great, but adequate. I would love DSL, but it is still $50 a month in<br/>\n&gt; my location.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto of Rivervale<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
