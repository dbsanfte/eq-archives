<b>Subject:</b> Gargoyle Island in Ocean of Tears <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326869623">The following rite up came from a website that offers guides for this <br/>
game.  I have found them helpful in the past.  But I can not find <br/>
the &quot;Gargoyle Island in Ocean of Tears&quot;.  I visited the Ocean of <br/>
Tears and gone to every island but did not find one as described <br/>
here.  Do any of you know weather this is a bad tip, old info or did <br/>
I just miss this island?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Gargoyle Island in Ocean of Tears. Get a level or two, plus 60-80 <br/>
gargoyle eyes here in a few days to a week of hunting and earn <br/>
yourself a cool 500-700pp or more. The eyes sell for 9pp each. The <br/>
thing to note with Garg Isle is that there are gargoyles and <br/>
skeletons. Kill a garg, a skel will spawn, and visa versa. Keep <br/>
killing the skeletons or no gargs will spawn! Also, some monks find <br/>
it fun to get a train of skels then run up to a garg, feign and let <br/>
the skels fight the garg down until the skels are dead, then pop up <br/>
and finish the garg. It works well, but I found it more efficient to <br/>
simply kill the gargs. This is also the place to learn to run around <br/>
in zoomed out mode. Hit F9 four times, zoom it all the way out and <br/>
then run around the isle. Takes some getting used to, but it&#39;s the <br/>
only way to go to spot the gargs when they spawn. This is a lonely <br/>
few levels, but the money is worth it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
