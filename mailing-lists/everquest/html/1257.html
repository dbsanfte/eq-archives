<br/>
To illustrate the trade up provision that many groups here use, let&#39;s say we are<br/>
hunting in the crypt in Old Sebilis and you win a ranger helm since no one in<br/>
the group can use and they do a group roll in the helm.  Later an item that of<br/>
greater value drops, you can say &quot;I would like to trade up.&quot;  You then get to<br/>
roll on the new item, if you win it, then your old item (the ranger helm) goes<br/>
back into the pot for the others (that have not got an item yet) to roll on and<br/>
you get the new item.  We figure it is a way to be fair in cause early on, lower<br/>
items drop and then we get higher items later.  As long as group understands we<br/>
are using that proviso, then there is no problem and people accept it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, we try to do groups that will last long times and do our best to<br/>
keep groups together until everyone gets something.  This does not always work,<br/>
but that is our goal in most groups I hunt with now.  Sometimes we form groups<br/>
with an agreement to get together on several different occassions to hunt items<br/>
for each member in the group, but like I said in earlier post, most grouping<br/>
that I participate in is done for experience and fun now versus loot.  I have<br/>
seen loot become too much of an issue and ruin too many in game friendships.<br/>
<br/>
Please do not get me wrong, I still like to get loot and still need money to buy<br/>
items I cannot camp or items that takes long time to camp like some of the<br/>
expansion spells I need.  I usually like to carry a stack or two of small<br/>
coffins on me to be able to help friends in corpse recovery when a camp or raid<br/>
goes bad.  I do not ask for them to pay for the coffins, I figure it is for me<br/>
to return back to the community a little of what I receive from it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am open to any suggestions that people might have for camp spots for farming<br/>
cash cow or loot that is easy to turn into cash.  So please if any of you have<br/>
any suggestions for hunt spots, please share them.  :)<br/>
<br/>
But enough on that,  I hope you all have good hunts and fun in EQ.  ;)<br/>

&gt; We do the same thing on my server with what you call &quot;king&quot; looter, but we<br/>
&gt; call it Commie (common) loot.  But how would you do the trade up?  We hold<br/>
&gt; all items until the end (except those that are Obvious equipment upgrades<br/>
&gt; for someone then we roll right then) and lets say 5 good items dropped<br/>
&gt; everyone would roll one time 100 to 1000 or 1 to 100 whatever different<br/>
&gt; every time and everyone picks in that order.  The bulk of the good gems and<br/>
&gt; PP would go to the cleric for symbols and maybe some to the enchanter if<br/>
&gt; he/she was using Rune a lot.  How does the trade up work?<br/>

&gt; In most groups that I hunt with now, we use the king looter system, where<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; person loots everything and then it is divided out when someone leaves the<br/>
&gt; group.  If a major item drops, we normally have it go to whomever will use<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; first.  If no one will use it as a primary item, then it is rolled on by the<br/>
&gt; group.  We allow people to trade up, when better items drop.  Some days we<br/>
&gt; might<br/>
&gt; only see one or two major items drop.  Then other days, we have seen<br/>
&gt; multiples<br/>
&gt; of items drop and everyone in the party get something good.  It is always<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; luck element that decides the quality and quantity.  Nowadays, I am more<br/>
&gt; experienced oriented and fun oriented than loot oriented.  Most of the<br/>
&gt; places I<br/>
&gt; camp do not drop items that are useable by my class or drop items that are<br/>
&gt; better than the items I might already have.  I do not like loot hogs or<br/>
&gt; ninja<br/>
&gt; looters, but I am not really concern about loot as long as the system is<br/>
&gt; fair<br/>
&gt; and everyone understands and agrees to it ahead of the time.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has been ages since I been in a group that use alpha loot or loot to X<br/>
&gt; plat<br/>
&gt; or whatever.  Normally, I really like the king looter system, since it<br/>
&gt; allows me<br/>
&gt; to concentrate on supporting the party and getting mana back up.  ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a side bar, what does FFA stand for.  I know I should know it, but I am<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; very good with abbreviations.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems with<br/>
&gt; &gt; loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br/>
&gt; &gt; healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br/>
&gt; &gt; totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>
&gt; &gt; loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they<br/>
&gt; care<br/>
&gt; &gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>
&gt; &gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>
&gt; &gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>
&gt; &gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; expensive<br/>
&gt; &gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>
&gt; &gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
&gt; &gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just wondering.<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; &gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>
&gt; &gt; people cooperate.<br/>
