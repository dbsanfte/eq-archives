<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853291107">If I&#39;m not mistaken you are referring to viewing the stats of an item you<br/>
wish to purchase.  If you have your inventory screen open, hold down the<br/>
right mouse button over the item.  Doing this will bring up a window<br/>
displaying the items stats.  If someone has an item you can achieve the same<br/>
process if they initialize a trade with you.  While the trade box is open,<br/>
hold down the right mouse button over the item in question.  Inspecting a<br/>
player simply shows the items and offers only the name.  However during a<br/>
trade the item&#39;s full stats are displayed.<br/>
<br/>
If your curious about an item someone possess, ask them if they will let you<br/>
see its stats in a trade window.  BTW don&#39;t press the complete trade<br/>
button.. they might not look highly upon you.. hehe<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] How to View an Iteam?!?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
 OK, so I&#39;m wondering how I view the details of an Iteam... I see <br/>
iteam details on web pages all the time. I would like to be able to <br/>
get this in the game so the next time I see a Ring Cloak I won&#39;t buy <br/>
it thinking I can wear it.<br/>
<br/>
~Thanks, Troll SK<br/>
