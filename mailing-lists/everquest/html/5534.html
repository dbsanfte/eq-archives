<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to share an account with 
a gentleman who was my next door neighbor.&nbsp; We set up a time to play he 
played late in the evening and I played during the day.&nbsp; It worked out 
quite well.&nbsp; Of course this was before ruins of Kunark came out, but it was 
still fun.&nbsp; we also split the cost of the account every month as 
well.</font></div>
