<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604134956">Speaking of backpacks, the inkies have a few quests that give you containers<br/>
to complete. You can get 5 containers (that I know of) and 3 of them are 10<br/>
slotters.<br/>

At the first, you have no cash to buy backpacks, no extra junk to<br/>
carry....that&#39;s a plus, IMO. I never could keep my monk under weight anyway,<br/>
she hovers at 28 or so bc  I couldn&#39;t resist a bit of twinking. Ah<br/>
well...for the weaponry she packs, it&#39;s worth it.<br/>

  &gt; Druids and monks are excellent first chars, as are pallies and warriors.<br/>
<br/>
  I would suggest not starting out with a monk, as their weight restriction<br/>
  would be fairly tough for a first time player to deal with<br/>
