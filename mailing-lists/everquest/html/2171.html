<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789118714">I kindof wonder if my old guild went kaput.<br/>
My new guild is going strong and getting more members. We have alot of fun.<br/>
Guild had really come in handy when I needed help. And sometimes it&#39;s just<br/>
nice to talk to people.<br/>
We sometimes go to places and help newbies as a group. It&#39;s fun.<br/>
I saw one guild in CB the other day just handing out stuff to newbies.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sorry to hear that. The first guild I was in seemed cool at first.<br/>
&gt; Although<br/>
&gt; &gt; I should have questioned it a bit more considering they didn&#39;t even ask<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Again I hit NO. Then it popped up again so I clicked YES just to make it<br/>
&gt; &gt; stop popping up. At that point I was so new to the game I really didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand what a guild was. Anyways, I made some good friends and was<br/>
&gt; &gt; having fun. But I noticed less and less of my friends were on.. I<br/>

&gt; &gt; officer and I didn&#39;t want to abandon her. Then I ran into my favorite<br/>
&gt; person<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the guild and she was in a different guild. I asked what happened and<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; said that there had been some bickering amongst some of the leading<br/>
&gt; members.<br/>
&gt; &gt; She was very nice to me as always. Later on I was still thinking of<br/>
&gt; leaving<br/>
&gt; &gt; but was having fun conversations with the guild leaders. But the very<br/>

&gt; badmouthing<br/>
&gt; &gt; me the guild leaders told me I had a choice: I could leave the guild or<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, it can happen to you!  A few days ago, my hubby was having fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with some guildmates when POOF! the guild was no more.  Took some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; figuring out but apparently the person that originally started the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guild and was tagged as the &#39;owner&#39; wanted to make a new guild but was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unable because she was still listed as owning Circle of Majik.  She<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had been forced out of the guild about a year ago because of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thievery and lying.  She was unwelcome with the current leadership of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Gawabiwa and could not get control except by force.  She went to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Verant and had her leader powers reinstated then promptly dropped<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone out of the guild without any kind of warning.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What a dirty underhanded thing to do!  She didn&#39;t have to drop<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone! or even anyone!  She could have come in and told everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; before hand, instead she had to yank it out from under us.  It hurt us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the core, but Gawabiwa has built a close knit guild and we are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our name.  We will rebuild our guild and get ourselves back on track.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  We won&#39;t be having anything to do with whatever guild she has whether<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; called Circle of Majik or not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We have lots of support too.  Check out the guild forum page for this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; controversy<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing I&#39;ve learned, if the current leadership doesn&#39;t own the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guild, the owner can do anything they please with out anybody else&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; permission, and that is just plain wrong!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry about ranting so long, but I&#39;m mad about this.<br/>
