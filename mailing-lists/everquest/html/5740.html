<b>Subject:</b> Who do you take first? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539811605">It happened again yesterday.  I pick a fight with an orc that cons yellow,<br/>
and a buddy of his joins in who cons blue.  I am working solo so they are<br/>
both my problem alone.  I have been trying to figure out the best way to<br/>
deal with them.<br/>
<br/>
Take the blue first since I can kill him quicker, thus I will recieve lets<br/>
hits total during the fight?<br/>
<br/>
Take the yellow though it will take longer to kill him, and I am getting<br/>
attacked by the blue the whole time, its the yellow one is doing the most<br/>
damage so the less time I face him the better off I am.<br/>
<br/>
Or is it pretty much a wash either way?<br/>

Me, &quot;No, now I am making tunics.&quot;<br/>
Her, &quot;And you make fun of Myst because of the lack of action!&quot;</div>
