&gt; <br/>
&gt; To those who likes zoning.<br/>
&gt; This is like cheating to me. If you fight a monster or get <br/>
&gt; attacked it would be much more fair if the monster followed you <br/>
&gt; to the other zone. To zone as a &quot;get a way&quot; tactic is wimpy. I <br/>
&gt; have to admit that I have done it but this is not the way I <br/>
&gt; fight. This is like using safe spots to fight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s many believes but I just wanted to give my 2 cents.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I am not sure, but I would not do it anyway for two<br/>
good reasons :<br/>
1) It makes me 1-2 minutes to zone - and the frustration this<br/>
causes is almost unbearable, zoning back and forth would drive<br/>
me insane !<br/>
2) Ask any necromancer or magician why it is a stupid idea to<br/>
hunt on a zone boundary and zone to escape 8)</div>
