<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066715389">They are for two quests:<br/>
Tesch Val scrolls in South Qeynos. Give one to Edvard Tommels near the bank<br/>
outside Office of the People. You may need to collect 4 different ones but<br/>
I&#39;m not sure. The reward is Karana&#39;s Tear a Sta +5 earring. Lore.<br/>
and  the other quest is for Gem Inlaid Gauntlets.  Here&#39;s the info from<br/>
eqdb.allakhazam.com<br/>
This quest starts out in North Qeynos at Crow&#39;s Tavern. Inside, an Erudite<br/>
librarian named Umvera Dekash wants you to return to him 4 different LORE<br/>
Tanned Split Paw Skins, which are dropped randomly off Gnolls in Infected<br/>
Paw and look like scrolls (not the old style tanned split paw hides that<br/>
looked like spells). The skins can be identified even if you cannot read<br/>
Gnoll, as the number of the scroll will always appear near the beginning of<br/>
the first sentence (1-4), not to mention that you will not be able to have<br/>
more than one of each in your inventory.<br/>
After returning the 4 skins to the librarian in Crow&#39;s tavern you will<br/>
receive a book of the translated split paw skins. Umvera will then tell you<br/>
that you need to have the book bound by Jheron Felkis, who can be located in<br/>
a spare room upstairs at Velith & Bardo&#39;s bar in East Freeport. Once bound<br/>
the book magically rewrites itself into a series of letters written by Ishva<br/>
Verishe Val to his subjects called &quot;A Paw Book&quot;.<br/>
Return the bound book to Umvera in Crow&#39;s and he will give you a sealed<br/>
letter to take to Durkis Battlemore in Butcherblock Mountains. Durkis can be<br/>
found in the guard hut just before Kaladim, on he path from the docks. In<br/>
return for the letter Durkis gives you a set of Gem Inlaid Gauntlets.<br/>
<br/>
