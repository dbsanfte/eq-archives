<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988340998">Yup, I had the same question.  I mean just a few minutes on the web and you<br/>
could get the answer to all of them with the exception of maybe a small<br/>
handful but you could find those as well.  I filled it out and answered &quot;I<br/>
dont know, but I am sure I could find out on the www if I wanted.  However I<br/>
dont think that&#39;s what you want.&quot;  Or something very close to that.  I got<br/>
picked but then turned it down because they didn&#39;t pick me until a couple<br/>
weeks before I went on my 6 month cruise.  I&#39;ll try again when I get back.<br/>
