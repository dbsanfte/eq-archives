<div id="ygrps-yiv-943305407"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;If you would like to include one example of why,<br/>
&gt;what aspect of the Vah Shir model requires DirectX<br/>
&gt;8.1 I would be happy to accept your line of<br/>
&gt;reasoning.  In fact other then the fact that each<br/>
&gt;model requires a more capable video card to handle,<br/>
&gt;what aspect of them requires anything other then<br/>
&gt;DirectX 7.  Sorry don&#39;t buy your argument.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The info that i&#39;d been getting on everquest.com and<br/>
other sites seemed to indicate that the improved<br/>
graphics engine was only a feature of the expansion,<br/>
and that even then virtually all of the features could<br/>
be turned off. The notable exception being the Vah<br/>
Shir model due to a lack of an &quot;old&quot; version. For<br/>
non-expansion users, it would stand to reason that the<br/>
major (if not sole) barrier between them and DirectX<br/>
7+ play would be the Vah Shir model.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;To say a company need to continue to provide support<br/>
&gt;for an OS that is no longer supported by its own<br/>
&gt;creator (especially in the gaming world) is somewhat<br/>
&gt;laughable.  If you can come up with one game out<br/>
&gt;there that supports concurrent multiple version of<br/>
&gt;DirectX other then downward compatibility, list one<br/>
&gt;for me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re misreading my arguments, I don&#39;t in any<br/>
way feel that it&#39;s necessary for Verant to offer<br/>
backward compatability for expansion users. What I<br/>
take issue with is the patches making the game<br/>
unplayable for the segment of the population who has<br/>
no interest in the expansion and wants to continue<br/>
playing &quot;EQ Classic&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Could you sight anywhere that says people don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;new graphics, and player models that update their<br/>
&gt;characters to those comparable, if not better then<br/>
&gt;those found in any other graphics based MMORPG.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it came at no significant cost, everyone would want<br/>
the improved graphics (except that silly new troll<br/>
model ;) but there is a cost involved, and one that a<br/>
significant portion of people are unwilling to pay.<br/>
Just look thru message boards at the uproar when<br/>
Verant originally changed the system requirements for<br/>
Luclin? Again though, this is addressing people who<br/>
intend to install the expansion pack, not the group of<br/>
users i&#39;ve been talking about. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you like MUDDs fine stick with them... However<br/>
&gt;everyone here that has Luclin and its new graphic<br/>
&gt;enhancements by far have been impressed and think<br/>
&gt;their great. Sorry I find it hard to believe in your<br/>
&gt;argument.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bah, that was just a way of expressing that to myself<br/>
and more than a few others, RPGs are more about<br/>
content and depth than pretty pictures. If you want<br/>
stylish graphics, go play Quake or something. The<br/>
graphics on most first person shooters are far<br/>
superior to even the new Luclin models.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And your reference to ORIGIN.. Origin started out<br/>
&gt;good.  Then they created a boatload of crappy games,<br/>
&gt;and released a total bomb of a film to the theater. <br/>
&gt;They alienated their customers with poor games and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bad<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;investments.  I don&#39;t know how many millions of<br/>
&gt;dollars they spend on the last Wing Commander.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The third Wing Commander was the initial game that<br/>
signaled the fall of Origin. The big problem there was<br/>
less that it was a poor game, and more that a large<br/>
chunk of their customer base had computers below the<br/>
minimum requirements or close enough that performance<br/>
was painfully bad. Ultima VIII was a combination of<br/>
both, a poor game with ludicriously high system<br/>
requirements for it&#39;s time. As things moved on, their<br/>
games got worse and worse, but it was their pushing<br/>
graphical boundaries initially that started their<br/>
decline. (notice that Sierra who put out just as many<br/>
horrid games, if not more, but at least stuck to<br/>
reasonable requirements, is still around and<br/>
successful today)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Again.. What aspect of the new cat model requires<br/>
&gt;DX8.  You seem to forget the whole world engine was<br/>
&gt;updated.  That goes beyond the added looks the<br/>
&gt;player models and world landscape.  It&#39;s the<br/>
&gt;underlining graphical programming interface.  The<br/>
&gt;engine runs so much faster now ( apart from a<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The impression i&#39;ve gotten repeatedly is that the<br/>
improved graphical engine was a feature of the<br/>
expansion, not something added via patches. I&#39;d<br/>
imagine if it were added via patches i&#39;d have spent<br/>
more than just 3-4 minutes downloading the patch... If<br/>
i&#39;m mistaken on this, then I concede the point that<br/>
the Vah Shir model is the significant difference. Of<br/>
course, then we&#39;re creeping into the realm of &quot;why<br/>
force this &#39;improvement&#39; onto devout longterm<br/>
customers who don&#39;t want it?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m a gamer and enjoy innovations/imaginations of<br/>
&gt;those that create them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a roleplayer in all of their forms, as such I have<br/>
priorities aside from hardware purchases. (as quite a<br/>
few people do, most people have *gasp* multiple<br/>
hobbies ;) Fortunately aside from the RAM, the system<br/>
requirements for Luclin were no problem for me, and<br/>
the RAM I happen to have the cash at the moment to<br/>
remedy. It&#39;s unfortunate though, that the dedicated<br/>
users to whom computer hardware is not a priority are<br/>
going to be lost. (again, referring to people who<br/>
cannot play EQ Classic due to the patches, not people<br/>
who are unable to run Luclin)<br/>
