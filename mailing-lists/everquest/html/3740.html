<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007064362">With the new UI the area with the switches is where to go. I don&#39;t <br/>
recall if it is just called options or what. Just look at all of them <br/>
and one will have a keyboard tab. The mapping is done there. Was a <br/>
while ago on the old UI that I did it. <br/>
<br/>
It does tie up a hot button. If I recall the way my son set it up, <br/>
the top right button in the hot button box, f2, became automatically <br/>
linked to the right turn button. That way whatever you wanted to have <br/>
assigned to go off whenever you turn right could be put on that <br/>
button.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously that can be good or bad. Put a spell there and you could <br/>
end up in some ugly fights. Put something like forage or sense <br/>
heading and you up that skill quickly. With forage, however, you end <br/>
up with roots and vegitables all over your cursor all of the time.<br/>

&gt; Hey Barto, how did you map the sense heading to  your right turn <br/>
key?  and<br/>
&gt; does this free up hotkey space for other things?  Reason I ask this <br/>
is I was<br/>
&gt; taught by a friend to have the Hotkey for sense heading to be in <br/>
the  first<br/>
&gt; space next to  my combat key like taunt or kick or bash depending <br/>
on  my<br/>
&gt; character that way I can increase sense heading skill while in <br/>
combat.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What my son and I did was to map the hot key to the right turn<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; button. Every time we turn right, we sense heading. Builds <br/>
skill<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quickly. Can be done for foraging, as well, but you end up <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on your cursor as you run around. Not always a good thing.<br/>
