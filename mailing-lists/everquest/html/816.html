<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654583126">Okay, okay, sheesh. I changed my little<br/>
description box to a simple &#39;hello.&#39; And I did<br/>
want to note that you can tell if the character<br/>
has special stuff on, [names and everything!]<br/>
only no detailed stats. I didn&#39;t ask to be an<br/>
asshole, I only wanted to know what the deal<br/>
was...<br/>

&gt; I for one cannot really understand why people<br/>
&gt; get upset when they are <br/>
&gt; inspected.  It is totally an issue of realism<br/>
&gt; to me.  Is it not realistic <br/>
&gt; that when someone looks at you, they can see<br/>
&gt; what type of boots you have, <br/>
&gt; what necklace you are wearing, what rings are<br/>
&gt; on your fingers?  WHAT&quot;S THE <br/>
&gt; BIG DEAL!!!!!!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because EQ&#39;s graphic design does not make any<br/>
&gt; distinguishing differences <br/>
&gt; visually for most items, including almost ALL<br/>
&gt; jewelry - the inspect command <br/>
&gt; just seems to me to be a less than perfect way<br/>
&gt; of looking at people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just like in the real world, you may meet<br/>
&gt; someone, they see an interesting <br/>
&gt; looking item on your neck, they simply ask<br/>
&gt; &quot;Wow, nice necklace - where did <br/>
&gt; you get it?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can choose to ignore them, lie, or tell the<br/>
&gt; truth.  JUST like in EQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now in real life, no one can see what&#39;s in your<br/>
&gt; pockets, or your backpack, or <br/>
&gt; other container items, and NEITHER can they in<br/>
&gt; EQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The fact that they only get a name of an item<br/>
&gt; and not it&#39;s stats is also <br/>
&gt; realistic.  Just like in real life they can see<br/>
&gt; your clothes and jewelry and <br/>
&gt; not see the brand name.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lighten up folks :)<br/>
