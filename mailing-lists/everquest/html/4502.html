<div id="ygrps-yiv-103555210">Growing older has given me my limits. I can&#39;t seem to do this for <br/>
more than three hours. My but starts to hurt and I get a headache <br/>
from eye-strain. But fear not, intrepid adventurers. I turn 50 in a <br/>
few days. Most of you probably have years before you start to fall <br/>
apart.<br/>

Good hunting, all.<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the info :) This game is so much fun. I am going to have <br/>
&gt; to start limiting myself tho - I found myself online from 6:00PM <br/>
&gt; until 11:30PM last night and the hours flew by :(<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh yes, one other thing...there are putrid skellies in SK that <br/>
give <br/>
&gt; hits<br/>
&gt; &gt; against Blood Sabers...might want to avoid those. They&#39;re at a <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Even if you do take hits against Guards/Merchants, it&#39;s <br/>
possible <br/>
&gt; to fix<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; without having to screw up your home guild fac. Go kill gnolls <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Blackburrow...it raises those factions without hurting your <br/>
other <br/>
&gt; ones.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, tho I&#39;m not sure how city guards would react to you, the <br/>
&gt; Gnome<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shadow<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Knights are followers of Bertoxx as well and might welcome you <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; kindred<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; soul. Watch your ankles tho.... :-)<br/>
