<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have never really learned how to camp an item or 
spawn, maybe because I played an enchanter for two years&nbsp;which is a 
terrible character for doing this with. The ranger seems much better suited for 
this, and one of the reasons I wanted to be a ranger is so I could walk into a 
low level dungeon and camp items. They get snare which is&nbsp;imperative for 
keeping mobs from running. They can track so outdoors they can find rare mobs 
and indoors they can see if any rare mobs are there.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I guess I am asking for some advice and tips. I 
camped&nbsp;some items&nbsp;with my enchanter and found it to be rather tedious. 
It seems like a good starting camp for beginners is the dragoon dirk in 
Crushbone. I&nbsp;once camped that whole area with my level 40 enchanter and 
with a pet it was actually pretty easy as long as everything is green to you. 
</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I camped some item for a quest in Upper Guk from 
the froglok&nbsp;scryer and I had to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;killing everything in the 
room&nbsp;until the Scryer actually spawned and I got the&nbsp;glowing 
gloves&nbsp;for the incandescent gloves quest. </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I guess I should go to Alakhazam and even pay the 
subscription fee to find out some good stuff to camp/quests to do, etc. 
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I guess you decide upon a target and then spend a 
ridiculous amount of time waiting for it to show up. </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Like a classic target is Grenix Mucktail, who drops 
the Polished Granite Tomahawk. I suppose in order to camp the PGT you just keep 
killing all the gnolls in the area that Grenix spawns until he does and then you 
kill him and get the Tomahawk. I don&#39;t think that is very productive for a level 
30 ranger to do, but it would be good practice. I suppose you would make some 
money from the items the gnolls dropped as well. Maybe I will camp the orcs on 
the other side to see if that guy who drops the weight reduction bag shows up. 
</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It seems like an enchanter is a better character 
for getting into groups and being invited on epic encounters, but a ranger is 
better for doing quests and camping items.
