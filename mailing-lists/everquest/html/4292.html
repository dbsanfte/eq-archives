<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; why I left the group the first time, because people assumed the worst and<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah. I think people are just a little touchy bc we used to get so much spam<br/>
from people trying to scam others out of their accounts. I made it a rule<br/>
that no selling of accounts is to go on here. People were perceiving it as<br/>
SPAM. So they reacted badly.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; First off, the CD keys are all different. I don&#39;t know who told you they<br/>
&gt; were the same or why.<br/>
&gt; Second off, old accounts can NOT be reactivated just like that. EverQuest<br/>
&gt; holds onto your unused and unpaid for accounts for six months before<br/>
&gt; deleting it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, you can expect that if you reactivate, your characters may still exist<br/>
and have the same levels but they may be missing all their gear and items.<br/>
And it might take a bit of calling customer service to get a reactivation.<br/>
