<br>
If you&#39;re in the EC area, go to an Orc camp and hunt, I always level nicely there.&nbsp; <br>

What is a good way to level up fast.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meaning, I see<br>
people say things like I can get from level 3-6 in<br>
around an hour.<br>
<br>
Well, the other day, I was on 5 hours and just leveled<br>
once.<br>
<br>
As a Newbie should we venture to more hostile grounds<br>
with others to level?&nbsp; Should we go to the same types<br>
of places as a group but not form a group so I can<br>
level faster?&nbsp; Or just stay in the newbie area until<br>
we get there?<br>
<br>
Enough for now<br>
<br>
Later all helpfuls.....<br>
