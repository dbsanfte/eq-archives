<p>I&nbsp;to thought that there were quick fix ways of getting money, but all it comes down to is killing the right mobs, i.e farming giants etc, selling your wares from tradeskills and farming items such as centi weapons etc. a lot of ppl tend to use a high lvl char to fund thier twinks, which is most likely the reason for the excessive amounts of money players buy/sell things for - sometimes it feels like im trading in russian rouble&#39;s as in pp being near worthless :(</p>
<p>i have seen some of these guides but havn&#39;t bought one yet so i have no idea as to there real value or content.Most likely they are like other official Game Guides for other games i.e a waste of time and money, anything in the guides you can probably find out just by asking the right questions or checking out sites such as alakazam and casters realm, i would ask around see if anyone has bought one before paying for information.</p>

<div></div>&gt;Does anyone know a good way to make money in Everquest. You find 
<div></div>&gt;these websites with these huge secrets to making plat. but who 
<div></div>&gt;knows. I just started, and didn&#39;t know this game could be so 
<div></div>&gt;addictive. I am a wood elf ranger. I boosted all my bonus points 
<div></div>&gt;to str at 90. So its not so bad. Im only level 3 though.
