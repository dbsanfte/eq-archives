<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EverQuest] Whats up with kill stealing???? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058663711">[Steven R. Hulse] I just found it extremely annoying. I was mostly just<br/>
working on leveling and the money aspect wasn&#39;t of too much concern but<br/>
what about all the newbies. Man that would really tick me off if I was<br/>
new and trying to earn some cash and some ass comes up and steals my<br/>
loot. <br/>
[Steven R. Hulse] For example, the other night I was with a group at Orc<br/>
Hill and accidently stole another player&#39;s kill. (Carnage everywhere,<br/>
got confused), My whole intention was to help her out since she was a<br/>
lower lvl character and getting her butt kicked by 3 Orcs Luckily she<br/>
shouted out and I realized what happened and made it up to her. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind the stealing if it was accidental and then they realized<br/>
and apologized, heck I probably would ask them to team up, All I want to<br/>
do now is lvl my characters. But blatently follow and steal is just<br/>
annoying. I&#39;ve noticed that a few newbies are the main ones. Yes I can<br/>
understand if youÂ’re a Gnome and go over to Greater Fey to lvl at Orc<br/>
hill or to buy stuff and don&#39;t want to get killed but hey there are<br/>
those of us that would love to team up with newbies to help them out. <br/>
<br/>
C-ya!<br/>
