<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651434690">Just thought I would share a picture if anyone cares to see it.  It was<br/>
during a GM run event.  First a bit of a disclaimer this is the first event<br/>
that I ever went to that was not a kill the bad guy event.  I had been to<br/>
many before this and when Mayong Mistmoore started running his mouth towards<br/>
a few people in the crowd (namely a lovely wood elf bard), I had just about<br/>
had enough of him.  So I charmed his buddy and tried to sick it on him but<br/>
before I could sickhim someone dispelled him, oh well.  I really would have<br/>
love to have off&#39;d one of the more famous mobs in game.  But instead I was<br/>
banished to Tox forest where I was yelled at.  Ahh such is life.<br/>

I had to change the color on the picture because the ship wont let me send a<br/>
file that is too large.</div>
