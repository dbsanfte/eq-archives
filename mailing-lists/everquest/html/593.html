<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791858616">Well, what about the economy? I hate to sit around and camp for items, but I would hate to have items I couldn&#39;t trade.. Btw if you implement level caps, people can still camp for items, but the only people that would be interrested in buying them, are people that could otherwise go get the item themselves.. Why buy an item you cannot use for another 15 levels? I think the prices would go up too, and LORE helps to prevent camping pretty much too.. So LORE + level capped items is the best way I think..<br/>

&gt; Sorry to be such a pessimist, but I personally think the &quot;NO DROP, NO<br/>
&gt; TRADE, LORE ITEM&quot; was put in to help stop the Camping issue. If a<br/>
&gt; person cannot sell these items then why stick around and camp the<br/>
&gt; site where these items spawn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know there will be the idea that a group can go in and camp the item, <br/>
&gt; but when all that group has the item, then they too will move on. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I am wrong, but I thought Brad was the one with this idea about<br/>
&gt; the Lore Items and was going to help out people camping.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;There is a new survey for the EverQuest community. <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;More and more items are becoming NO DROP now, meaning you cannot trade or sell them, and since Verant pushes forward about the game having a &quot;player based economy&quot;, the NO DROP items really ruin this concept.. There is a way to prevent &quot;twinking&quot; and still have the items availible for trade, an alternative to NO DROP. Put level blocks on equipment, meaning you cannot use/wear the equipment until you are high enough level for the item, the level will be somewhere below the level you need to get it.<br/>
