<div id="ygrps-yiv-757660572">the 200pp is too expensive for me. I don&#39;t get much plat when I play. My connection is too slow for me to loot. It takes 3 seconds to loot a single object from a corpse. So looting my corpse is a nightmare. As the healer I can&#39;t be looting a corpse when the tank is pulling. It takes too long in between. Especially since it will not let me move off of the corpse when I want to. It can take an additional 5 seconds for it to release me. I really like the Loot all function in warcraft. The automatic rolling is ok but sometimes it is annoying. I can rez my own corpse though. I guess the biggest nuisance for me is the zoning time. It just takes so bloody long.<br/>
I hope they find a way to deal with that someday. Hopefully soon.<br/>
luv,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;For the most part, that&#39;s not really necessary any more.  I agree the ghost thing is cool in WoW.  It&#39;s fun to explore the world like that.  But in EQ, now it&#39;s not really necessary to try and make it back to your corpse.  Since Dragons of Norrath introduced the Guild Lobby and Guild Hall you can go to a corpse summoner in he lobby and summon your corpse from anywhere in the game for a small price ((comparatively speaking)).  I think its like 200pp for a 60+ summon.  There are usually people on hand in the lobby that can rez you.  Also, thre&#39;s Shadowrest which is accessible from POK.  you can go there and have your corpse summoned as well.  Take someone with you to rez you.  Sometimes its better than trying to get back to your corpse without gear.<br/>

&gt;  I&#39;m still considering getting the expansion but am not sure. It takes me 10 minutes to login and 2 to 5 minutes to zone..<br/>
&gt;  I really wish they could do what Warcraft does and make it not take so long when you die. I really do like the spawning at a graveyard nearby in ghost thing in warcraft. Although sometimes it can be annoying. It beats having to wait all that time to zone and then trying to get back to your corpse with no gear.<br/>
&gt;  Thanks for the info!<br/>
&gt;  luv,<br/>

&gt;  &gt;I did the digital download and the bonus was a free spirit shroud (a golem)..  I&#39;ve used it once, but the mechanical mount looks like the war piggies in Plane of Tactics.  They had a big problem with people doing the monser missions.  They were too easy and people were soloing them for AA xp.  They&#39;ve nerfed them a bit now.  And now it&#39;s like watching paint dry.  they don&#39;t mvoe very quickly, and I&#39;m wondering if the amount of xp is worth the effort.  Still, some of the drops are really decent.  Frankly, I think Dragons of Norrath was a better expansion pack.  They have overhauled the UI somewhat.  Now you&#39;ve got 4 hotkey bars: 2 horizontal, and 2 vertical.  You can customize all 4 of them in the Options window.  A lot of people say it looks a lot like EQ2 now, but I dont think so.  It basically looks similar to what it was, just more colors to contrast some of the data.  Yadda Yadda.<br/>
