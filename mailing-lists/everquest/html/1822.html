&gt; Mmm... it&#39;s true that the peopel who are getting PLed are not doing<br/>
&gt; much work.  They level faster than people who actually level<br/>
&gt; themselves.  I understand how you would think this is not really fair<br/>
&gt; but sometimes people like to help others.  When I help people, I PL<br/>
&gt; them.  I won&#39;t help them get equipment because that&#39;s what you need<br/>
&gt; to do for yourself since it generally makes you more powerful<br/>
&gt; especially magical items.  AND when I PL them, I don&#39;t take over<br/>
&gt; camps to help them level.  I just look around for roaming mobs that<br/>
&gt; are not a RARE of course and let them kill it.  Heal them when<br/>
&gt; necessary.  The usual method.  I don&#39;t steal camps from people or<br/>
&gt; camp things when tyring to PL &#39;em.  I know that&#39;s wrong cuz if I did<br/>
&gt; that I would feel like I&#39;m hogging the camp since I wouldn&#39;t get xp<br/>
&gt; in the first place and it&#39;s a camp that everyone wants to have.  For<br/>
&gt; example, PLing in cb.  I just look for any orcs i see and let them<br/>
&gt; kill it.  There are hardly any camps in there.  The only camps there<br/>
&gt; are in cb are in the castle itself and near the tents.  Anyway, my<br/>
&gt; point is, is that I find it wrong when people take over camps to PL<br/>
&gt; but I find it ok when people just kill roaming mobs to PL.  AND yeah,<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like when peopel twink.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t give peopel<br/>
&gt; equipment or money.  Maybe leather armor but that&#39;s about it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Opinions vary. I personally find the whole power leveling idea to<br/>
&gt; be most<br/>
&gt; &gt; dishonorable. To see an orc camp taken over by a 50+ druid and a lv<br/>
&gt; 6 ogre<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer reminds me how people are<br/>
&gt; have no<br/>
&gt; &gt; willingness to work for things (the whole cheat code thing). But<br/>
&gt; many people<br/>
&gt; &gt; find it ok to twink/power level and, well, so be it. I can see it,<br/>
&gt; shiver,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and keep moving. Live and let live. I am fortunate that at lv 43 I<br/>
&gt; can solo<br/>
&gt; &gt; and this is only an inconvience at worse to me instead of a real<br/>
&gt; issue. But<br/>
&gt; &gt; up until lv 35 I was still having camps stolen from me by uber<br/>
&gt; twinks and<br/>
&gt; &gt; anon druids.<br/>
