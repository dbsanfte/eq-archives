<b>Subject:</b> Bummed out.. :( <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988470516">Like the subject of this message says, I am quite bummed out, by the mere<br/>
fact that I have yet to receive a copy of the game. I live in sweden and<br/>
preordered the game about one week before the end of beta phase 4, now I<br/>
have ordered it from 4 places both domestic(one being the largest comp.<br/>
game distributor in sweden) and foreign. But I still haven&#39;t received the<br/>
game. Now I am active reader on eqvault as well as participate in mailing<br/>
lists, and this is REALLY annoying. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve had some extra<br/>
time thinking about what class/race I will play.. And if I don&#39;t get the<br/>
game within 2 weeks from now I&#39;m gonna give up and buy Ultima or<br/>
something, but then again, I would have to kill myself.. :p<br/>

- Avron - Totally BUMMED right now! :(</div>
