<div id="ygrps-yiv-659000427">I am seriously thinking about getting this. I agree on the opening <br/>
and bashing of chests and things. Other games I&#39;ve played, it&#39;s kinda <br/>
fun finding new treasures in chests and when I find a chest in EQ I <br/>
want to bash it then remember I can&#39;t LOL. <br/>
<br/>
I think that the private space will be cool! My help some of the <br/>
lower-level players (such as myself) level a little faster without <br/>
getting accused of Ks&#39;ing :) <br/>
<br/>
The EQ site mentioned LoY Broken Skull was the starting point of this <br/>
new expansion. Does anyone know if I need to purchase LoY first <br/>
before I can buy the new expansion?<br/>

&gt; So, another expansion pack is coming out. The features listed look <br/>
pretty<br/>
&gt; cool.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll be interested to see how they are implemented and how they <br/>
work in the<br/>
&gt; game.<br/>
&gt; Anyone else looked at the webpage and have any thoughts on this?<br/>
&gt; I love the idea of being able to unlock, open, or bash open chests <br/>
and such.<br/>
&gt; That is something I feel was missing from this game. And the <br/>
private space<br/>
&gt; sounds good too.<br/>
&gt; Thoughts?<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
