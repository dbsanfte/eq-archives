<div id="ygrps-yiv-17176392">Well, this particular kid purposely got me killed (we were in group and were<br/>
going to attack something together-- when I got aggrod on he did nothing to<br/>
help). He waited until I was dead (and the mob was half dead) before<br/>
attacking. When I respawned before he finished it off, he disbanded me so he<br/>
would get all the xp. It really sucked.<br/>
The kid shouldn&#39;t have been playing.<br/>
I guess if the kids are supervised and know how to behave its ok.<br/>
