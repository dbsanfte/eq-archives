&gt; fall in and get killed to return tothe city? I&#39;m starting my hunt for <br/>
&gt; the three requested bare skinned rock hoppers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>when you head from the city to Shadeweaver&#39;s, just when the bridge<br/>
ends, turn to the right, but stay close to the wall. you should be able<br/>
to go up and down there.<br/>
<br/>
you should also memo the locations of guards in the crater, because<br/>
you can train mobs on them; but be careful not to train on other players<br/>
resting there!<br/>
