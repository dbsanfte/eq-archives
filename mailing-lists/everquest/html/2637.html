<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513108554">Oops. Typo. It&#39;s 1Gb of RAM. Sorry. I should proofread my own messages.<br/>
I need the RAM to compensate for a 26k dial-up connection. Can&#39;t even get<br/>
28k! I&#39;ve ranted about this before. Still can&#39;t find my consumer rights<br/>
regarding my phone service so they are royally screwing me.<br/>

2GB of ram?!?! Isn&#39;t that a little excessive? Do you know if the 1.5 Ghz<br/>
Duron has been released yet? I always double everything when it is<br/>
availiable. I have a 750 Duron now and 512MB of ram. I guess I need to get a<br/>
1.5Ghz Duron, 1GB or ram and what ever video card is relatively cheap right<br/>
now, guess ill have to do some research on that. Maybe a 19&quot; monitor too.<br/>

  I have the same video card and it runs great on mine. But it is a 64mb<br/>
one..<br/>
  and I have an AMD 1.4Ghz processor and 2Gb of RAM..<br/>

  What video card do you have? I have a Geforce 2 MX. When I first started<br/>
  playing with the Luclin expansion, it ran like crap until I turned down<br/>
the<br/>
  clip plane and then it ran great and all was well.<br/>
