<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586338141">There is a great quest item with ext enhancement on it It is called <br/>
the Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl it is a tradeskill quest however and <br/>
takes some time to complete and has the effect of &quot;Zephyr of Brell&quot; <br/>
which is 30% extension on your beneficial spells, as a bonus it also <br/>
has FT 3 as well.  If you plan on getting your trade skills up then it <br/>
would be a great piece of gear to get as it is a shoulder item, <br/>
shoulders are the hardest piece of gear to upgrade. <br/>
