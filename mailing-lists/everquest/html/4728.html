<div id="ygrps-yiv-846350313">It seems there may just be enough people to for a small group.  <br/>
Is the newbie server Stromm OK with everyone.  Anyone who wants to <br/>
join role a newbie toon on Stromm  Thursday at 6 pm eastern standard <br/>
time loggin, then join channel hoggtyed that way we can see who is on <br/>
and where at we can go from there.   So far we have a Human monk.  We <br/>
will try and shoot for a well balanced group so depending on turnout <br/>
we may have to adjust characters. <br/>
   Main thing is we have fun.  If any of you cant make it but intend <br/>
to try and come in the future shoot me an email at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hoggtyed@...">hoggtyed@...</a> <br/>
   Looking  forward to see what happens til then safe journeys to all.<br/>
