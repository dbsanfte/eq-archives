&gt; One point - with the zone loading it is not at all a question of *your*<br/>
&gt; loading the zone into memory - if you watch your HD while zoning<br/>
&gt; you will notice that it only spends a fraction of that time on actually<br/>
&gt; loading things - the rest is network traffic. This is because the zones<br/>
&gt; on each server are split up among many different computers.<br/>
&gt; From what I can see, when you zone, the game logs you off the<br/>
&gt; current zone server and then logs you into the new zone server<br/>
&gt; automatically. This is why sometimes you get kicked back to the<br/>
&gt; login screen when you are zoning ( the login to the new zone server<br/>
&gt; time outs ) .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It would be nice if it could transfer you straight into the zone if it is<br/>
&gt; on the same zone server, but the way it is setup allows for load<br/>
&gt; balancing and such which is good ( but damn the wait is<br/>
&gt; frustrating 8) )<br/>

&gt; Everquest is best thing what i see in online gaming, from graphic to sound<br/>
&gt; and grup sistem but it still miss much things wich leaves too much place<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; concurent products to enter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First it is hard to add new zones or monsters it request huge uploads (<br/>
&gt; this can be corrected with addon discs but it is another question),<br/>
loading<br/>
&gt; of zones is realy messed up if you just exit one zone it takes soooo long<br/>
&gt; to reload it again it will be nice to have 2 zones in memory if you have<br/>
&gt; enough memory for this (i have 128 mb).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; it is concentrated on gruping but too hard for solo play for some classes<br/>
&gt; and i dont like to play necromancer or any pet holder, and gruping have<br/>
&gt; much flows wich need corection and additional balancing like higer lv<br/>
mages<br/>
&gt; and wizards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also there are too low gains from questing and one thing wich can add much<br/>
&gt; to game can be a god questing sistem where many diferent players must<br/>
&gt; cooperate to reach some target but for now it is only killing stronger MOB<br/>
&gt; and if you spend 5 hours to resolve quest and in end you dont know a right<br/>
&gt; word wich you hear on other side of continent you make all way back write<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; right word on paper go back and say it only to get 1 rusty sword and 5<br/>
&gt; copper as a 12 lv caracter not to see any move on your experience bar it<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; realy bad. i do it 3 times to 3 diferent quests and as i try hardest<br/>
things<br/>
&gt; what i found and after this reward i lost wish to try again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; to be thrue it will be nice to get experience also for trading skills and<br/>
&gt; give them more variants so a posibility to make all normal armours and<br/>
&gt; weapons. And it will be nice to have possibility to make a dragon leather<br/>
&gt; armour ( hint hint)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It will be nice to have some chests wich thiefs can picklock.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fishing some other things then normal fishs, or other stramge things like<br/>
&gt; boots with a gen in bag with a surprise big fish wich will pull you in<br/>
&gt; water and cast summon pirana swarm on you eheheeh<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It will be nice to have a place where you can leave your goods to sell and<br/>
&gt; where you must pass evry now and then to collect all income or it is lost<br/>
&gt; put this place on some lost plane or limit sellers to some level range, i<br/>
&gt; wish to buy a totem stah and all mana gain equipment but as im from europe<br/>
&gt; and i play normaly when all servers are empty i cannot buy or sell nearly<br/>
&gt; anything. and i play on fenin ro wich is all time full. ( hmm maybe i will<br/>
&gt; move from rathe mountains not too much people know where this place is<br/>
&gt; eheheheh)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is great and wonderfull world but for now it is a little bit empty it<br/>
&gt; needs a soul, a movement a random orc attacks on kelethim, dark elf<br/>
rampage<br/>
&gt; on freeport, dragon flying in sky in unknown direction, strange never seen<br/>
&gt; beast in dark wood to start legends. More inteligence in program to make<br/>
&gt; world looks more diferent so that finaly a camping is not more<br/>
interesting.<br/>
&gt; It is not need for human intervence it can be done by program if you leave<br/>
&gt; a orc camp and in zone is many players then why not that orcs group and<br/>
&gt; start hunting around geting items from falen (eheheh at last some money so<br/>
&gt; bank will get some real signifikance). Other similar products will come<br/>
&gt; soon big bad MS is preparing to enter in game on big door ( i just read a<br/>
&gt; news on its site it will bring some interesting news) the other players<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; also on front door for bringing something new soon everquest will not be<br/>
&gt; only game in 3d rpg town and if a game is not interesting enough when<br/>
&gt; others come in play ? .... ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. I like this game very very much and all this critics are only in hope<br/>
&gt; that it will give some ideas how to make it better and that i will be<br/>
shure<br/>
&gt; to play it long long time as i enjoy it now. ( my english is not maxed jet<br/>
&gt; sorry)<br/>
