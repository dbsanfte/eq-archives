<div id="ygrps-yiv-603054277">This Saturday I went from level 15 to 17 in a couple of hours<br/>
<br/>
In Crushbone (off of GFay),  I was lucky enough to get into a full group in<br/>
the throne room.  We killed EVERYTHING...If you can get as many bags filled<br/>
with the pads/belts from the cents and legos, you can level quick as hell.<br/>
<br/>
Only big downtime is when someone pulled Dvinn from the tower.  If he is in<br/>
the area...just save time and run for the zone, because some moron is going<br/>
to try to pull him.<br/>
<br/>
at level 16...four CB belts = 1/3 of a blue bubble...basically just fill up<br/>
the bank and you&#39;re inventory and run to kaladim and change em in....big<br/>
exp...</div>
