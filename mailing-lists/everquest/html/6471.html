<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866945781">Moving is not an option at this point. Basically we<br/>
were not allowed to return from overseas for 9 years<br/>
and when we came back our house and property had been<br/>
totally trashed. We&#39;ve sunk at least $60,000 into the<br/>
place in repairs. But we got hit by 2 hurricanes and<br/>
got no help from FEMA. Our insurance claimed to have<br/>
no record of our policy and refused to pay anything.<br/>
Add to that I&#39;ve had heart problems and had to have<br/>
some medical procedures-- insurance deductible is very<br/>
high. Between fixing things up we are trying to find a<br/>
lawyer to sue the doctor who screwed up on my father<br/>
which has so far cost us at least $20,000 in medical<br/>
bills (not counting the gasoline of travelling to<br/>
Houston and hotels and such). We had to take out 2<br/>
mortgages on the house and cannot sell it in its<br/>
current condition. Even if we could, we still have<br/>
livestock that we don&#39;t want to part with and there<br/>
really isn&#39;t a place in our price range that we could<br/>
afford to move them to. <br/>
We are going to have to spend even more money because<br/>
the power company did something that caused a huge<br/>
surge and fried several of our surge suppressors (so<br/>
badly that one of them burned the floor). <br/>
I&#39;m not even going to go into the vet bills... <br/>
Its one of those neverending things..<br/>
Ok. I&#39;ve vented enough about that...<br/>
Oh man, I know exactly what you mean on the running<br/>
across the zone and then being warped back and dead. I<br/>
hate that!<br/>
Don&#39;t laptops overheat? Or have they found a way to<br/>
fix that now?<br/>
Lag just sucks bigtime.<br/>
Tradeskills can be fun, but frustrating. I really<br/>
worked on them for my 8th shawl. Too bad that it soon<br/>
turned out to be lame stats compared to other stuff<br/>
you can get now-- for much less work. I did almost all<br/>
of the droppable combines for my brother&#39;s rogue epic<br/>
1.5. I tell ya.. Why can&#39;t the cleric epic 1.5 have<br/>
the tradeskills instead? Seriously, I would&#39;ve<br/>
completed it in a week!!<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have you considered moving? lol<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Forgive me, Im not making light of your situation,<br/>
&gt; I just find it a little funny to hear about your<br/>
&gt; issues.)  See I fried my desktop, and with money a<br/>
&gt; bit short these days, I am set to play EQ on a<br/>
&gt; laptop, that wont quite handle it well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It takes 10 minutes to log in, if it does. If it<br/>
&gt; does then there is no guarantee that I will stay and<br/>
&gt; if I do, how long I will stay in. If I&#39;m in, I lagg<br/>
&gt; so badly it sucks. I can run halfway across a zone<br/>
&gt; and not realize I was lagging the whole time, so<br/>
&gt; when it unlaggs im back where i started from. I can<br/>
&gt; aatack something, and by the time I unlagg its dead.<br/>
&gt; IIm afraid to hunt with my 61 bst right now because<br/>
&gt; of it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hunted at the OC in POV the other night, and i<br/>
&gt; lagged so baadly as i was chasing down the kill, i<br/>
&gt; ended up halway across the zone, but that was<br/>
&gt; because of a stuck button......and not being<br/>
&gt; familiar too familiar with the zone, i nearly<br/>
&gt; trained everyone<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So needless to say, Most of my toons are maaxing<br/>
&gt; their tradeskills and all skills in general just by<br/>
&gt; hanging out in POK. So I shouldnt complain really,<br/>
&gt; at least I can get in and hear thatt wonderful irish<br/>
&gt; pub song as i run by the &quot;still&quot; in PoK...lol<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As always<br/>

&gt;  look into the abilities of the Acronis one to see<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt;  it would work for what I want to do. If not I may<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt;  about going with Norton Ghost 10.0. I really really<br/>
&gt;  appreciate the info!<br/>
&gt;  I just need to remember to burn something to DVD to<br/>
&gt;  help restore windows XP in case there is a problem<br/>
&gt;  when I upgrade to the new mainboard setup.<br/>
&gt;  Direcway just sold out to Hughes.net and the<br/>
&gt; service<br/>
&gt;  has really declined. I keep having pages timeout<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt;  loading and get errors, their tech support no<br/>
&gt; longer<br/>
&gt;  works (can&#39;t get through to anyone), and my pop3<br/>
&gt; email<br/>
&gt;  no longer works (despite my following their<br/>
&gt; tutorials<br/>
&gt;  on setting it up). So I had to switch to using<br/>
&gt; yahoo<br/>
&gt;  email. bleh. I think its evident I&#39;m more than a<br/>
&gt; teeny<br/>
&gt;  bit annoyed. <br/>
&gt;  The bandwidth cap is a major pain. When I first<br/>
&gt; signed<br/>
&gt;  up they said that unless I was constantly loading<br/>
&gt;  really large files at a high rate of speed I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  have to worry about the cap. That was before they<br/>
&gt;  lowered the amount of bandwidth allowed before<br/>
&gt;  capping. Loading a patch for EQ takes about 4 hours<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt;  more. Its really annoying. I lose connection<br/>
&gt; whenever<br/>
&gt;  it rains-- or sometimes when its bright and sunny<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt;  no apparent reason. I would not recommend this<br/>
&gt;  &quot;service&quot; to anyone. I had to call tech support<br/>
&gt; sooo<br/>
&gt;  many times that I memorized some of the routines<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;  then one of the techs in India started flirting<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt;  me (which was actually pretty funny).<br/>
&gt;  Man.. I&#39;m venting..<br/>
&gt;  Once I get the system upgraded I will see about<br/>
&gt;  playing again.<br/>
&gt;  Thank you!<br/>

&gt;  &gt; Look into a prograM called Norton&#39;s Ghost.  It<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt;  &gt; do exactly what you want it to do.  I&#39;ve used it<br/>
&gt;  &gt; several times on my own systems when installing<br/>
&gt; new<br/>
&gt;  &gt; hard drives to set as primary.  Basically, what<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt;  &gt; do is install the new drive as a slave,<br/>
&gt; completely<br/>
&gt;  &gt; wiped (you dont even have to partition it).  Then<br/>
&gt;  &gt; you install Norton&#39;s Ghost on your main drive. <br/>
&gt; Run<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Norton&#39;s Ghost and choose the option to do a<br/>
&gt; direct<br/>
&gt;  &gt; ghost copy to the new drive.  Everything right<br/>
&gt; down<br/>
&gt;  &gt; to the partitions will be copied to the new<br/>
&gt; drive. <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Then you shut down the machine, switch the drive<br/>
&gt;  &gt; over to master and reboot.  Barring any major<br/>
&gt;  &gt; problems it&#39;ll boot up exactly as if it were the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; regular drive on that system.  Then you can take<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; original drive and wipe it and use it as a<br/>
&gt; secondary<br/>
&gt;  &gt; for extra space.  It&#39;s a handy program.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Your system sounds decent enough to run EQ albeit<br/>
&gt;  &gt; with some lag in the newer zones.  Turning off a<br/>
&gt; lot<br/>
&gt;  &gt; of options might help that though.  However, on<br/>
&gt;  &gt; DirecWay I wouldn&#39;t expect too much.  DirecWay is<br/>
&gt;  &gt; bad about limiting the amount of data that can be<br/>
&gt;  &gt; sent at any given time.  If you send mroe than<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt;  &gt; are allowed to, they pretty much stop all<br/>
&gt;  &gt; communication and give you some stupid message<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt;  &gt; exceedxing the bandwidth.  Then it takes like 5<br/>
&gt;  &gt; minutes to reset.  You can look it up, the info<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt;  &gt; right there ont he DirecWay site.  That&#39;s why<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt;  &gt; don&#39;t reccomend using DirecWay for gaming.  But<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt;  &gt; all you want to do is browse the web and chat,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;  &gt; fine.  If I can find the link, I&#39;ll post it for<br/>
&gt; you.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt;   I have a Cleric. But I haven&#39;t actually gotten<br/>
&gt; xp<br/>
&gt;  &gt; in<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   over a year. I can&#39;t even get dialup where I<br/>
&gt; live<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   because the phone company has spliced my lines<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   badly I can&#39;t even dial out to an ISP. They<br/>
&gt; refuse<br/>
&gt;  &gt; to<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   fix it and so far I haven&#39;t found any way to<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt;  &gt; them<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   to. Too much other stuff to worry about<br/>
&gt; frankly.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Like<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   finding a lawyer to sue a doctor for<br/>
&gt; malpractice,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; and<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   still working on repairing hurricane Rita<br/>
&gt; damage.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   I currently have direcway Satellite-- which<br/>
&gt;  &gt; inherently<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   has latency. When I first got it with the<br/>
&gt; Direcway<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   4000 2-way the bandwidth was 800k down and<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 50k<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   up (allegedly 50k up-- clocked around 30k).<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Sometime<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   later when the modem died due to an incident<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt;  &gt; my<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   cat and a glass of milk I got the newer<br/>
&gt; Direcway<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 6000.<br/>
