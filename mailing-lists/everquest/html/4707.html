<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114314614">Hi everyone. I just made level 22 last night and when I went to get <br/>
training, I had 10pp in my inventory. When I was finished I didn&#39;t <br/>
have any platinum left. I thought that training used your points that <br/>
you got from leveling and didn&#39;t cost anything? Can someone explain <br/>
why it&#39;s costing to train now?</div>
