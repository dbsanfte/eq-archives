<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812095897">For the page, you will need to leave the town of gukta and right <br/>
outside there should be what looks like a little bag on the ground. <br/>
That should be the page that you need. <br/>
<br/>
You can check allakazahm to get the exact /loc (I&#39;m at work so I <br/>
can&#39;t check that right now)<br/>
