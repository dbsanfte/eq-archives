possible models set, with a relatively weak machine.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Thanks again for all of the suggestions! Really appreciate it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I already have the VM set to max - no problem with all of the<br/>
&gt; available disk space.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seems most of you are pointing to the Video controller as the<br/>
&gt; likely solution. Could well be - the existing one is only 16MB. But<br/>
&gt; why would a slow video cause such a hit on the hard disk, which seems<br/>
&gt; to be viusally where the bottleneck is - i.e. on zoning, the hard<br/>
&gt; disk is very active until it zones are goes back to the server<br/>
&gt; screen. The hard disk is performing extremely well and is very fast,<br/>
&gt; so that is not the problemin itself - could the slwo graphics card<br/>
&gt; cause EQ to go to the hard disk more to compensate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am not sure I could go to a 128MB graphics card - would 64Mb do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks once again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yep...it does make a big difference.The VM tweak is just a<br/>
&gt; little &quot;freebie&quot; for overall performance, not just EQ. 11 day uptimes<br/>
&gt; on my WinME-based EQ box... yup, consider me convinced, fully and<br/>
&gt; truly. Likewise the amount of sheer ABUSE my LAN server gets, and the<br/>
&gt; stability and speed difference once the VM was fixed to reflect<br/>
&gt; changes in real ram.Overall, spending $50 for a Geforce 2 will be an<br/>
&gt; investment you&#39;re likely to be pleased with. Also, if your power<br/>
&gt; supply is wimpy, consider invest in a bigger one...300 watts should<br/>
&gt; be plenty for a Geforce 2 and sufficient cooling for everything, but<br/>
&gt; 250 will do the trick with less breathing room...any less, upgrade.<br/>
