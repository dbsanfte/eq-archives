&gt; I was talking with my son-in-law while taking one gnoll, and rooted <br/>
&gt; the thing at the spire rather than pulling him away. I guess I was <br/>
&gt; distracted. A second gnoll came along and agroed on me, driving me <br/>
&gt; away. I knew I did not have the mana to manage both, so ran south <br/>

&gt; full capacity, with no gnolls in sight. Didn&#39;t even zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I went back to get some more gnolls, but found someone camping the <br/>
&gt; spire I had been working. I started to leave, honoring his claim to <br/>
&gt; an abandoned camp, when a gnoll hit me from behind. I lead him on a <br/>
&gt; fatal chase. The camper sent a tell regarding a perceived violation <br/>
&gt; of camp courtesy, for which I appologized.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems that the gnolls will abandon a chase after some time and <br/>
&gt; distance, but remember you well. The second gnoll I had been <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, gnoll hunters, keep in mind that an injured gnoll has a long <br/>
&gt; memory, and even longer agro range.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;ve had the same thing happen to me.  As long as you are the <br/>
only one to do damage to them you are still their primary target.  <br/>
Just wait until you get to Kunark, the place is crawling with mobs!  <br/>
It looks like a newbie zone on Anatonica.  I&#39;ve run through FM and <br/>
seen giants, brutes, goblins and Burnayi all within aggro range of <br/>
each other.  So be careful!<br/>
<br/>
As for DoT&#39;in them I prefer to DD or shoot them, snare them, root <br/>
them then DoT them.  I read somewhere that DoT&#39;s work better if the <br/>
mob isn&#39;t moving.  As a Ranger I then pile on the arrows (Can&#39;t wait <br/>
for Tolans Bracer!) and wade in when the root breaks.  If you get 2 <br/>
park one one, snare him and blast the other one.  You can even <br/>
Harmony him to break his aggro!  <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s be safe out there!<br/>
