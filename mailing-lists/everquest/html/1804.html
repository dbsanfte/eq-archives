I have a 38 dwarf cleric on The Nameless.  A few tips:<br/>
<br/>
1) Max wisdom - not all subscribe to this, but you have an inate strength already as a dwarf.  I put my other points to bring up either dex or agility, whichever lower<br/>
2) Find a regular partner to help you to level at the low levels - you can solo first few levels, but I found grouping with one other PC helped<br/>
3) As a cleric, go to Kurn&#39;s tower around level ten - lots of undead to nuke on when alone and clerics were always welcome in groups there<br/>
<br/>
Use the other yahoogroups specifically for clerics for more help and advice: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_Cleric@yahoogroups.com">EQ_Cleric@yahoogroups.com</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ-Clerics@yahoogroups.com">EQ-Clerics@yahoogroups.com</a> - Some of the folks there are quite, er, vocal and opinionated, hehe.  But we all know that Dwarves make the best clerics - you picked the right race.<br/>
<br/>
Use Caster&#39;s Realm and Rayne&#39;s cleric site for cleric reference information.  Also Allakhazam&#39;s for a lot of general information.<br/>

Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m about 2 years late but better late than never.  I am on <br/>
Ayonae Ro and just made a dwarf cleric.  Any little tips and advice <br/>
thrown my way will be very appreciated.  Beside saving up fo rmy <br/>
spell, I bought the book, should I invest next for my armor? weapon? <br/>
or misc items such as rings?  Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
