question.&nbsp; Some weapons have required levels listed, other have 
&quot;recommended&quot; levels.&nbsp; A weapon might say Damage 10 (20), Recommended Level 
26.&nbsp; Am I correct in assuming the first number is for those under 26, and 
the second is for 26 and higher?</span></font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Some weapons require a certain level before the 
  effect will &quot;proc&quot; (process).&nbsp; It could be that you just havent reached a 
  high enough level for this to happen.&nbsp; Until then you will only get your 
  10+.&nbsp; When it does proc it will be accompanied by a text message sayng 
  &quot;Such and such was hit by a cold wind for so many points of damage.&quot; or 
  something like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some weapons have a number in 
  parentheses.&nbsp; That number in parentheses is the level you need for the 
  weapon to work at maximum.</font></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
