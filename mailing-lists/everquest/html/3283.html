<div><font size="2">LOL I call mine Flappy too and feed him treats, emote him 
purring, biting ppl who are snotty to me, etc. It&#39;s at least a cool idea...and 
really, a actual pet of any sort would make a wiz overpowered if you think about 
it. I&#39;m content with my lil guy, even if he is just a visible buff.

  vs. Familiars<br><br>Familiar is a wizard&#39;s pet. It can&#39;t fight, it&#39;s more 
  like a visible<br>buff. You have to resummon it each time you die, but it 
  zones with you.<br><br>[Steven R. Hulse] Well that kind of sucks! I mean 
  thanks for the info<br>but if they can&#39;t fight then what good are they? I 
  guess it&#39;s cool to<br>have it follow you around and stuff. Oh well, I didn&#39;t 
  design the game.<br>;-)

  Familiars<br><br>It&#39;s also the first spell of that type a wizard gets so it 
  fizzles a<br>LOT. My<br>wizard spent a good 3 hours medding and fizzling just 
  trying to get her<br>familiar back. I&#39;ve never noticed any change in my 
  fizzles or anything<br>after<br>a successful summoning. And sometimes it runs 
  off and I can&#39;t find it.<br>But<br>it&#39;s fun to have it just following around 
  and flapping it&#39;s little<br>wings.<br>When I&#39;m bored I just talk to my 
  familiar and emote I&#39;m feeding it<br>cookies.<br>Too bad you can&#39;t name your 
  familiars. I call mine Flappy.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br>Familiar is a

  Is this a new thing? I used to have a wiz at one point<br>but it never had 
  this spell until like a higher level. Hmm, cool. You<br>know, I think I may 
  have met you the other night, Someone, (I can&#39;t<br>remember their name now), 
  was talking with their pet, It was kind of<br>funny at first I didn&#39;t realize 
  it was their pet and thought it was<br>another person! ;-) It was at the Orc 
  lift in Felwith. <br>&nbsp; <br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
