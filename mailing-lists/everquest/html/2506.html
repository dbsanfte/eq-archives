<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399748068">Had that problem a week or two ago. Didn&#39;t resolve for two days, then <br/>
I was suddenly back in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Tried to go through tech support. They were willing to help, and had <br/>
me upload some info from my system. The problem was resolved before <br/>
they got to analysing the info, so they said they were happy all <br/>
worked out well and said goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe the customer base is expanding faster than the servers <br/>
can handle. Some of us are getting locked out because the game is <br/>
just plain full.<br/>

&gt; I tried to load the official EQ webpage. File not found.<br/>
&gt; Hours later my mom tried on her account. Same thing.<br/>
&gt; Then mom finally got logged in over 12 hours later. she got to <br/>
character<br/>
&gt; select. then tried to login a character but got booted out and got <br/>
the same<br/>
