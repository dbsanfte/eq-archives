<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443608546"><p>Aye,&nbsp; good point.&nbsp; at lower levels cash really isn&#39;t all that important, unless you don&#39;t have the pp to get all of your important spells.&nbsp; I currently have a 50 shaman, and the most cash I have ever had at one time is 2500pp.&nbsp; and that was just recently in the last week or so, before I bought some of my 50+ spells in the bazaar.(after 50&nbsp;cash becomes pretty important especially if you are a spellcaster, because about 75% of your 50+ spells are NPC drop,&nbsp; and if you buy them,&nbsp; they can cost upwards in the 10k&nbsp;range for certain spells.)&nbsp; I honestly wouldn&#39;t worry about having the &quot;uber&quot; equipment untill you get higher level.&nbsp; Those characters who do have the uber stuff at lower levels ar the ones who have level 60 main characters who have nothing better to do than farm for cash all the time, and twink their lower level characters out with stuff.
