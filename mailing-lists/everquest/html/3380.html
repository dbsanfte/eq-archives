<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Went there this morning to set up some sales. Lag was terrible. It<br/>
&gt; was hard to even get my cursor on target. I suppose it will be ok<br/>
&gt; once I get set up to sell, but the set up is terrible. Move cursor.<br/>
&gt; Not on object. Move a bit more. Not on object. Move back. Click.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t have object. Click again. Hmph. Had object but didn&#39;t know it,<br/>
&gt; and just put it back. Click...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Took so long that I didn&#39;t finish setting up before I had to log. I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t have logged if I could have left my toon to do business<br/>
&gt; while I was gone, but no such luck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just gotta get another machine, faster connection, and retire from<br/>
&gt; my job so that I can play all the time.<br/>
