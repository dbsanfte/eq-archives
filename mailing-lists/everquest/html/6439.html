<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764503517">yeah. I saw that before. That only does the entire group setting. it doesnt&#39; give me the option to make individual members unmoderated. I know there used to be a way to do that but I can&#39;t seem to find it.<br/>

&gt;Go to &quot;management&quot; (left-hand column of group home page), then choose &quot;messages&quot; from &quot;group settings&quot; (options available on right-hand side of screen).  Then click on &quot;edit&quot; next to &quot;posting and archives&quot;.  You can change it from there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;Hope that helps!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are a few people that have been posting well but it still has <br/>
&gt;them on moderated status and I cannot for the life of me find the <br/>
&gt;command in stupid yahoo to remove individual people from moderated <br/>
&gt;status. I have looked all through Management, Messages, Members, <br/>
&gt;Posting, etc and cannot find the bloody thing.<br/>
&gt;Yahoo&#39;s help page was not very helpful. It didn&#39;t say where to find the <br/>
&gt;option. UGH!<br/>
&gt;I apologize to the people who have been trying to post and have to <br/>
&gt;wait. It&#39;s pissing me off that I can&#39;t find the thing to unmoderate...<br/>
