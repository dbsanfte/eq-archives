So, are you saying that people with more money are more important?<br/>
I think all of the customers are important. That is why Verant should<br/>
consider all of them and try to make the system work for as many as<br/>
possible. Even people who like upgrades may have problems with this.<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about having a win95 OS. I&#39;m talking about people who can&#39;t<br/>
afford to upgrade RAM or video cards. It&#39;s not as easy for everyone to get<br/>
stuff as it might be for you.<br/>
Besides, not getting updates is not nearly as bad as not being able to play<br/>
the game at all-- especially when the game was already paid for.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, and maybe $265 isn&#39;t that much for you. But to some other<br/>
&gt; people that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a<br/>
&gt; rent-to-own<br/>
&gt; basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s easy to say<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an escape for them. To<br/>
&gt; suddenly<br/>
&gt; not be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way<br/>
&gt; Verant<br/>
&gt; could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so<br/>
&gt; financially<br/>
&gt; stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if nothing else.<br/>
&gt; Btw, someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap? Where was<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; again? I just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of RAM with it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; motherboard and chipset.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not<br/>
&gt; cost that<br/>
&gt; &gt; much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me<br/>
&gt; $265 after<br/>
&gt; &gt; tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.  The chip is<br/>
&gt; a AMD<br/>
&gt; &gt; Athlon 950.<br/>
