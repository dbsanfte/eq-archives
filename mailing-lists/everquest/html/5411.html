<div><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#004080">Your skill advancement is based on yuor level.&nbsp; You can find the modifiers on several websites including <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.castersrealm.com">www.castersrealm.com</a>&nbsp; As for the negative exp modifiers, don&#39;t let them get you down.&nbsp; Iksar make the best Monks, they have better vision, higher natural AC and natural regeneration.&nbsp; Iksar also make the best Necromancers, due in no small part to natural regeneration.&nbsp; And frankly, Kunark is undead Heaven, plenty of places to level your Necro.&nbsp; My leveling lines always have characters in Kurns Tower from 10-20.&nbsp; The negative modifiers are overplayed.&nbsp; Would you rather level a Halfling Ranger to level 65 in&nbsp;10 days less played, or invest the extra time and have yourself a Troll Shaman, which is the best race/ class combo in the game?&nbsp; As for your Monk versus your Pally in duels,&nbsp; A Pally can be a monster dueling, with LoH you basically have to kill him twice.&nbsp; Monks, Rogues and other melee damage classes, generally don&#39;t duel as well, you never see them on PvP servers.</font></div></html></div>
