<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128136350">One thing I learned is that virtually noone really pays much attention to<br/>
ooc in Paludal Caverns with all the cussing and KS yelling.  Some people<br/>
even turn the ooc off.  As for yelling for you to Go Away...either they had<br/>
been fighting off others trying to take the camp and didn&#39;t pay attention to<br/>
your request or they are just the kind of jerks i find a lot of in the game.<br/>
Bringing the mobs back to the camp was a bad idea since it might trigger<br/>
more mobs on you and them...a move some people use to wipe a group at a camp<br/>
then take it from them.  Asking ooc they may have not noticed, again might<br/>
have turned ooc off, especially if they had a fight going as messages fly by<br/>
fast.  The only thing you can do is try to take them or run to zone.  When<br/>
one runs to zone with mobs always best to shout or ooc a train so anyone<br/>
near it hears that since in PC most people sit around the Shadow Haven ZL<br/>
waiting for a group to open.  As for what they will do to you later...most<br/>
people I have played with know about the kind of people who constantly do<br/>
things like this both intentionaly and unintentionaly.  They understand<br/>
people will train zone and often if they were not ready they have no way of<br/>
shouting train without getting killed themselves.  People will listen to<br/>
both sides usually.  I even group almost daily with one lady who I trained<br/>
and killed 3 times in one day.....guess she wanted to make sure she knew<br/>
when I ran..lol.  Most people forget your name though, all you have to do is<br/>
play on..))</div>
