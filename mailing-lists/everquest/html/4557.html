<div><font face="Arial" size="2">All of the noobs moved to Paludal Caverns where 
they now bicker over bandit camps.&nbsp; Luclin is really what changed the 
demographics.&nbsp; Especially the Bazaar.&nbsp; Before the Bazaar everyone sold 
their wares in East Commons Tunnel.&nbsp; But now it&#39;s so easy to get better 
armor and equipment that all noobs are twinked, they level faster, and now 
because of POK and the NExus, they can go anywhere they want without the aid of 
a druid or wizard so the planes and the higher level zones are becoming more 
populated.&nbsp; If this is how it is just in the under 2 years that I&#39;ve 
played, I can&#39;t imagine what it will be like in another 2 years. </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>I popped into West Commons my last two sessions to see if I 
  could bag <br>a giant. Just wanted to come back to the zone and do that, since 
  now <br>I can. The place is so empty! Back when I was a teen it was busy, 
  <br>laggy and fun. It is deserted now.<br><br>I have to wonder, are there very 
  few real noobs these days? Has POP <br>changed the demographics in Norath? 
  Places that were good fun and <br>fellowship are dead. Even Velious is 
  starting to seem empty. Are all <br>of the players getting into the high 
  levels and now living in the <br>Planes?<br><br>Barto
