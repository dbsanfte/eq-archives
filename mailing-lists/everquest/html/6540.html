<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503896446">Some co-workers were talking about Everquest and it sounded like a <br/>
great game. They said there was a free or trial download so I could <br/>
give it a try this weekend. I thought what a perfect opportunity to <br/>
try it while I have a couple of days off.<br/>
<br/>
Well, my problem is that I don&#39;t know what site to download the game <br/>
from or what version. I mean there is a Everquest 2 and there are 7 <br/>
day trials and a 30 day one but only if you are on a certain server <br/>
etc. I&#39;m so confused and I haven&#39;t even started the game...lol. <br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone knows of the best site to download from I&#39;d really <br/>
appreciate it. I can&#39;t call my co-workers since I dont know their <br/>
phone numbers off hand. I guess I&#39;d like to be able to have the <br/>
download from a place that has several servers so I can find my co-<br/>
workers on there when I see them next. <br/>
<br/>
Oh by the way I&#39;m not sure if this makes a difference when <br/>
downloading etc. but after talking with my co-workers about <br/>
characters/classes etc. I decided I would like to be an Elf :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch in advance for all of your help and hope to see you <br/>
playing Everquest soon!<br/>
<br/>
thx,<br/>
