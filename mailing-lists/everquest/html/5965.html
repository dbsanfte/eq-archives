<div><tt><strong>As for EQ2, beautiful graphics. That&#39;s about all I can say. I 
haven&#39;t <br>actually played the game so I&#39;m not sure what game play is like. 
<br>Although one thing I&#39;ve heard about and I kind of wish they would 
<br>include in EQ1 is the conning system. Now I guess instead of the little 
<br>color ring, you also get icons either above or below the NPC name that 
<br>shows exactly how tough they may be. Also if you have a mob and you 
<br>target one it shows you ALL the others that will come running if you 
attack.<br><br>Happy adventuring!<br>Durgaa; Ranger of the 32nd Season on

<div><tt><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes, I do like that about EQ2.&nbsp; It goes a 
little further into detail though.&nbsp; As far as the conning system, you&#39;ve 
got 7 colors instead of 5 like in eQ1.&nbsp; The colors in EQ2 range as 
follows:&nbsp; Grey, Green, Blue, White, Yellow, Orange, and Red.&nbsp; On Grey 
mobs there will never be any xp.&nbsp; A further indication of the mob&#39;s 
toughness are the arrow indicators above its name.&nbsp; The arrows can point 
either up or down.&nbsp; If the arrows point down it means the mob is weaker 
than its color implies, and if they point up, its tougher than the color 
implies.&nbsp; So for example, you con a White mob and the message said it&#39;s 
evenly matched with ou, it should be a good fight.&nbsp; If it has two arrows 
pointing up, chances are it&#39;s a little tougher than you are and you might need a 
back up heal.&nbsp; this helps when deciding which mobs to take.&nbsp; Another 
thing the conning system has is that it will indicate &quot;Solo&quot; or &quot;Group&quot; when you 
target it.&nbsp; Any time you&#39;re soloing and it indicates Group in the target 
window, you better not even try it cause you won&#39;t live unless you got plenty of 
friends to help.&nbsp; Another cool thing is that during combat you actually get 
to see the mana of your caster mobs.&nbsp; When it runs out of mana it can no 
longer cast spells on you and it can only melee until the end of the 
confrontation.&nbsp; this comes in as a good strategy during some higher level 
fights.&nbsp; If the mob is focusing only on the tank, then the rest of the 
casters in your group can cast without being interrupted.&nbsp;

<div><tt><font face="Arial" size="2">As far as gameplay, that&#39;ll be up to individual 
preferences.&nbsp;&nbsp; Me, personally, I think EQ2 is a bit more simlistic 
since it&#39;s been laid out better and things are explained in more detail.&nbsp; 
there&#39;s no real guesswork in the quests.&nbsp; But if you only play the game to 
have fun and not to have to think a lot, then it&#39;s good.&nbsp; If you want 
quests where you have to try to figure out every single detail, then stick with 
EQ1.</font></tt></div>
