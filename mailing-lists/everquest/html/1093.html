<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269990962">Well, the internet stuff said it was Treaserur Lynn. But I tried talking to<br/>
her and nothing happend. I gave her a ticket and nothing happened.<br/>
The quest info said I&#39;m supposed to talk to someone. I talked to everyone<br/>
around and nobody would respond.<br/>
So I&#39;m basically screwed.<br/>
