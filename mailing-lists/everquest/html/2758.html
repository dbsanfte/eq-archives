<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155883558"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have heard of quad-kiting, but never really gotten<br/>
&gt;a good explanation of it. Since you have done it,<br/>
&gt;could you explain?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a quick rundown, it&#39;s really quite simple and<br/>
being a druid, safe as always. By the level you&#39;re at<br/>
you should realize that we never die, we just gate.<br/>
*grin*<br/>
<br/>
First off, always try to do it in an unpopulated area,<br/>
people around especially at lower levels are a real<br/>
pain. Nothing worse than having some jerk snare one of<br/>
the mobs you&#39;re quadding. (completely ruins the quad,<br/>
you&#39;re likely best off gating at that point)<br/>
<br/>
You start by finding four mobs, preferably identical<br/>
ones that you know are well suited to quad kiting.<br/>
(Snow Cougars, Ulthorks, and Wyverns are well known<br/>
for it, Wyverns will get you thru the low 50s I<br/>
believe) Snare one, find another, repeat til you have<br/>
four snared and angrily chasing you.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have all four up, back away so that the mobs<br/>
start to group together a little. Explaining this is a<br/>
little tricky, but basically if there&#39;s two mobs<br/>
snared, one ahead and to the left, one ahead and to<br/>
the right, if you continue backing up eventually<br/>
they&#39;ll come together.<br/>
<br/>
After they&#39;re loosely grouped together, run circles<br/>
around the mobs just outside of their melee range to<br/>
get them grouped right on top of each other. They have<br/>
to be VERY close together, it sounds tricky but really<br/>
it isn&#39;t. If you&#39;re not sure, do another circle around<br/>
before casting.<br/>
<br/>
ok, so now you have four angry and closely grouped<br/>
mobs. What now? If you&#39;re lower than level 34 you run<br/>
like hell cause you can&#39;t quad kite yet. *grin* If<br/>
you&#39;re level 34, memorize the spell Lightning Strike,<br/>
and kite like normal.<br/>
<br/>
Lightning Strike is the first druid AOE spell, dealing<br/>
about 125dmg to a maximum of four targets. Just kite<br/>
like you normally would with a DD spell until all four<br/>
targets are dead. Usually this will take you from full<br/>
mana to OOM, so don&#39;t be surprised or worried when you<br/>
get low on mana.<br/>
<br/>
Quad Kiting usually gets you about one more mob out of<br/>
your mana bar than normal kiting, so it&#39;s not a huge<br/>
increase, but what&#39;s best about it is once you&#39;re OOM,<br/>
you can just hide or camo, have a seat and walk away<br/>
for five mins while you get your mana back. Just make<br/>
sure Hide succeeded before walking away.<br/>
<br/>
If memory serves you&#39;re still 33 so you have one more<br/>
level to go, take the boat to Velious to rot and root<br/>
Snow Cougars til you get that last level, you can<br/>
start quadding Cougars right away and they drop Cougar<br/>
Claw Earrings that generally sell for 250-300pp each.<br/>
Once the XP from Cougars starts to tail off, you can<br/>
head over to Eastern Wastes to do Ulthorks, which is<br/>
when the money starts to pick up. (Ulthorks drop<br/>
around 4pp in coin each, as well as ulthork hide<br/>
armor, words/runes, velium weapons, and rarely ulthork<br/>
tusks for a quest in CS where you can get Blue<br/>
Diamonds among other things)<br/>
