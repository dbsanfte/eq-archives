<div id="ygrps-yiv-445529624">Thanks to all that replied to my original message.  Bought the <br/>
trilogy, started this afternoon,  9 hours later I can see why its <br/>
called Evercrack.  Started  a wood elf ranger. <br/>
 2 questions:<br/>
1.  In the game on the main screen on the middle right is a green bar <br/>
with a number , a percentage, another percentage, and a second number <br/>
(always changing), what is it? I couldn&#39;t find in the manual.<br/>
<br/>
2. Can anyone recommend a site/guide that has a good EQ lingo <br/>
glossary.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again <br/>
