<b>Subject:</b> Lag in real life <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260374765">Can you imagine lag in real life? The only experience I ever had like<br/>
that was the result of inhailing the vapors of a certain herb. My<br/>
brain reset every thirty seconds for about two hours. Like lag in the<br/>
game, it was something one could work around. Unlike in the game, I<br/>
found it rather pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
I had an amnesiac during a surgery. That is not the same thing. I<br/>
really don&#39;t remember much at all. Nothing of the surgery itself.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it suck if people driving old cars suffered from lag? New<br/>
cars would flash by in lurching images as we who had old cars would<br/>
try to figure out where the danger might be. The road would be like<br/>
POP with an old machine. Almost impossible to navigate.<br/>
