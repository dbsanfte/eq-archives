<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010688341">As far as I know no matter what class you play that has allows a pet whether<br/>
you be a BST Sk Necro Shaman Chanter Wiz(?) Mage(?) whatever you are only<br/>
allowed one pet at a time.  From what I have seen  the higher level spell<br/>
you cast that is a pet summoning spell that pet is supposed to be better<br/>
than its lower level equivalent.<br/>

    I have a question I know that a beastlord gets a pet at level 9.  What<br/>
happens when he gets the new pet at higher levels does the old one go away<br/>
for the new one or can he have more than one pet.  I mean if you get a new<br/>
pet spell and the old warder is powerful why would you  take a new one if<br/>
the old one is powerful or is the new one even more powerful?  I am starting<br/>
a beastlord on the Drinal server by the name of Jubar and Vah Shir.  any<br/>
help would be appreciative.  Thank you for your<br/>
<br/>
