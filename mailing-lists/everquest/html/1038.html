<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663318514">Well, not just newbies.<br/>
I believe in helping anyone who needs help. I constantly take alot longer to<br/>
get places with my cleric bc I heal everyone in sight and give binds if<br/>
people are asking. People don&#39;t even have to ask for the heals. I click on<br/>
everyone around and if they look injured I heal them.<br/>
When I started a newbie character I helped some other newbies out and they<br/>
in turn helped me.<br/>
I&#39;ve made some good friends.<br/>
It&#39;s fun.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; Anyway....It&#39;s a good thing to help newbie&#39;s when you see one.  Helped a<br/>
&gt; newbie by explaining the /loc command and showing him around Kelethin.<br/>
&gt; turns out that that made his level 40 brother very happy...now he wants to<br/>
&gt; make me happy (hopefully NOT in that way)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; so...the moral of the story is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Help newbies....you just might be helping them help you in the long run.<br/>
