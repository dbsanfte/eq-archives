&gt; I love porting. When I was in Kunark I bound myself at the mill and<br/>
&gt; occassionally would self-port to EC to buy stuff from Freeport. I <br/>
even made<br/>

&gt; Cool. What faction are the rock dervishes?<br/>
&gt; I have a lvl 29 DE wizard. I want to get her high enough to group <br/>
port to<br/>
&gt; EC. Right now she can do Toxx, NK, and GFay. But EC would be much <br/>
more<br/>
&gt; useful to port to. Finding groups is difficult for her. I want to <br/>
find<br/>
&gt; something I can solo that won&#39;t kill my faction with my DE kin but <br/>
won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; ruin any good faction i&#39;ve earned with the good guys.<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt; &gt; When I was a level 14 druid someone on the list suggested <br/>
Lavastorm.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was there until level 19. The loot is pretty good, cash anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; from poor to fair, and the hunting interesting. Getting there was <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; special adventure for me, as I am KOS in Neriak. I went in chamo <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; levitated, turned left as I entered the forest, and kept to the <br/>
zone<br/>
&gt; &gt; wall. There is a river half way through the zone, which I levved<br/>
&gt; &gt; across (not being a good swimmer) and kept on along the wall.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I really liked the rock dervishes. Good cash and they dropped ore,<br/>
&gt; &gt; which sells well but is heavy. I would pick up a load until I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; encumbered even with strength, then port to a selling point. If <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can find someone to port the stuff out at a discount, the ore <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; &gt; be profitable.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I mostly solo, so that is what I did there. Lots of fun.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good hunting.<br/>
