<div id="ygrps-yiv-669899048">Well I just learned something new today. People have been giving me<br/>
pet toys for three years and I didn&#39;t know what to do with them. My<br/>
kitty shaman has a wolf pet and wolves don&#39;t have inventory slots to<br/>
put things into. So I just tried &quot;giving&quot; my pet the toy this time.<br/>
Surprise! Surprise! So that&#39;s how you do it. G.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also figured out why you only give a temporary pet temporary<br/>
toys. Fortunately I did that before I gave it something really<br/>
expensive. G. Pets don&#39;t give their toys back.<br/>
