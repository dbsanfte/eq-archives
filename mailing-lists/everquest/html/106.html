    I&#39;m sorry to see you having so many problems.  I am on a 28.8 modem and<br/>
an AMD 300 machine with RIVA TNT.  The only problem I have is prom my ISP.<br/>
I have a Live card installed and the initial install was painful to say the<br/>
least.  This is what happened to me.  After installing Live I found that the<br/>
all my DMA channels were taken.  If you have a hard drive that uses DMA then<br/>
the Live card may have taken it away.  This caused my system to lockup<br/>
because my hard drive would take all CPU processing whenever it was<br/>
accessed.  Even for just looking at the drive space would shoot my CPU above<br/>
100%.  I had to reload my drivers for the hard drive.  You may want to go to<br/>
your drives site and get a current version of the driver while you are at<br/>
it.  Just incase you don&#39;t know how to check to see if DMA is checked on the<br/>
drive, go to the control panel select System and then device manager, select<br/>
your hard drive and select properties.  The DMA box should be checked.  If<br/>
there is know DMA box present(as was my case) make sure you have a DMA<br/>
drive.  If you do install a new driver.  If the new driver doesn&#39;t resolve<br/>
the problem then use a generic driver.  I have a 2.5 gig Western Digital and<br/>
a 6 gig Maxtor.  They both use a generic driver and I haven&#39;t had any<br/>
problems since.<br/>
    If this isn&#39;t your problem then I guess best of luck.  I hope that this<br/>
may help a bit.<br/>
