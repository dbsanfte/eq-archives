<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100410383">My sister had a brand new computer-- not a doorstop but even it couldn&#39;t<br/>
handle the new changes. EQ does not still support low end.<br/>
I&#39;m worried that they will someday upgrade beyond my range of being able to<br/>
afford new hardware. My finances are about to take a hit.<br/>
My dad is getting me new RAM. He has the same computer.<br/>
And I was gonna get a friend of mine to start playing EQ but now his system<br/>
won&#39;t be able to handle it.<br/>
I just wish things weren&#39;t such a hassle.<br/>
But it could be worse.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, and maybe $265 isn&#39;t that much for you. But to some other people<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a rent-to-own<br/>
&gt; basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s easy to say they<br/>
&gt; should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an escape for them. To<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way Verant<br/>
&gt; could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so financially<br/>
&gt; stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if nothing else. Btw,<br/>
&gt; someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap? Where was that again? I<br/>
&gt; just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of RAM with it&#39;s motherboard<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not cost<br/>
&gt; &gt; that much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me<br/>
&gt; &gt; $265 after tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; chip is a AMD Athlon 950.<br/>
