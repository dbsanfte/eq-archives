Before buying a new video card as someone else suggested, I would <br/>
try installing the new 56.64 drivers from NVIDIA first. Your card is <br/>
not that old. It&#39;s part of the GeForce4 series which is one series <br/>
before GeForce FX (in case anyone didn&#39;t know). The 56.64 drivers <br/>
support your card. Also, to reduce headaches, set a restore point <br/>
before upgrading the video drivers. I prefer to uninstall and re-<br/>
install drivers in Safe Mode. In this way, you&#39;re sure the system <br/>
isn&#39;t using any of the driver files.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at SOE&#39;s required specs (forget recommended specs), I <br/>
believe that your system meets or exceeds their requirements.<br/>

And, this is SOE&#39;s guide to the DirectX 9.0b upgrade: <br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that dx9 isn&#39;t so great. I was getting used to things <br/>
with the previous version. I have a GeForce Ti 4600 vid card, 1GB of <br/>
RAM, 1.4GHz processor... and I keep lagging really badly, have lousy <br/>
framerate, and zonecrash alot more. I also can&#39;t target corpses. <br/>
Even with /tar it isn&#39;t working all the time. which sucks for a <br/>
cleric trying to rez. It&#39;s extremely frustrating. I hope they fix <br/>
this soon. Oh, and all that is with particle effects off, clip plane <br/>
set low, and most luclin models off.<br/>
