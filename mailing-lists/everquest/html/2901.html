<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-840716709">Sorry, I believe you are mistaken. <br/>
<br/>
The only PCI cards at Babbages are the Xtasy 64 SDR (GF4 MX) and the Xtasy 5332 (GF2 MX200). Matter of fact, it looks like they only sell the Visiontek cards. If you take a look at the Visiontek site, they only list the Ti as AGP. Or go to PNY, or any other video card manufacturer and you will see the same thing. The Ti versions only come for an AGP slot. If anyone thinks I am in error, please provide me with a link.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have played with both cards and I thought the Geforce 4 Ti made<br/>

&gt; Ti, the day that I spent with that card was the most enjoyable day I<br/>
