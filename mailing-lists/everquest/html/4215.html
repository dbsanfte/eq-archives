<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089877768">I am working up a Bar. Shamman and have made it so far to 12th level, <br/>
the starting Intel. is 60 for the class/race.   I Got a really great <br/>
set of arms (Giant scalemail arms) it give +3 wis, +20 hps -3 int <br/>
which reduces my intel to 57. I Juat got a Good spear for my class <br/>
and level and am trying to learn it up in skill levels, I have added <br/>
10 points to Pierceing and been stabing the &quot;Heck&quot; out of anything I <br/>
con Light Blue or higher and have not gone up one poing in pierceing. <br/>
Now to what I wanted to know.....<br/>
<br/>
Does the Dif. between an intel. of 60 and that of 57 make any change <br/>
in how well I Learn skills with use? If so then I have a great set of <br/>
arms that a spell slinger can use on the server I am on and if not <br/>
then how high do I need to raise my Intel to learn quicker?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks..<br/>
