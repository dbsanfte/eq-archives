<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151537633">Funny you should ask. I was with a party in The Estate of Unrest Sat night<br/>
and most of the day Sunday, and we found quite a bit of Sm. bronze armor and<br/>
a Blood stained mantle. The bronze armor was mostly on the high level<br/>
skeletons and high level ghouls. The blood stained mantle was on The undead<br/>
knight of Unrest, a very nasty guy.<br/>
<br/>
I also heard there is bronze on the dry bone skeletons in lake rathe that<br/>
only come out at night, but that place is camped BIG time. I am not sure the<br/>
size.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
