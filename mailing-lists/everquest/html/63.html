<b>Subject:</b> Router problem <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756869119">Does anyone have experience with this problem:<br/>
<br/>
If I switch to another zone I get kicked of the server and the games tries<br/>
to connect to the login server again, which also fails. If I want to login to<br/>
everquest again I have to reboot/disconnect my router, then I can login<br/>
_one_ time and play one zone before I have to reboot the router again.<br/>
I play lots of other games through my router, but maybe it&#39;s slightly<br/>
misconfigured. It&#39;s an Intel 8100. Please help this is getting a bit annoying.<br/>
