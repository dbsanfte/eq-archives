<div id="ygrps-yiv-576238886">I have an HP Pavilion 9905 with AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1.4GHz processor (actually clocks below 1.4), 1Gb of RAM (upgraded from 512), 2 harddrives (primary one that came with PC was supposed to be 40Gb but when I checked it reads as a 35Gb with 10Gb partitioned for the &quot;restore&quot; function making it useless and another 5Gb taken up by all the crap HP installed on it. Secondary is around 80Gb). Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card (has always worked fine for me with no conflicts) and GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128mb video card (that was also an upgrade I added). The northbridge on the chipset with my ASUS A7M266-M motherboard is notorious for corrupting memory on computers. HP really sold me a lemon. The DVD drive, floppy drive, and a few of the USB ports are defective. The best thing about the PC is that I got a large tower that is easy to open up.<br/>
I just dumped the 250W power supply that came with it and replaced it with a Antec SmartPower 2.0 450W power supply (got it on ebay for less than $50 and it runs quieter than the crappy one HP put in).<br/>
I&#39;m trying to get the ASUS A8V Deluxe motherboard, AMD Athlon 64 3200+ 2.0GHz processor with Venice core, and 1Gb of Kingston DDR400 (PC3200) RAM. Newegg has the motherboard refurbished for under $100 but I don&#39;t know if I should buy refurbished... Money is an issue and the computers with all of the specs I want are well over $500. I don&#39;t want to buy from Dell bc I&#39;ve dealt with their customer &quot;service&quot; before. Don&#39;t want to buy from HP again bc they sell lemons (and they claim that you will never need higher than 300w power supply-- which is why a pc my father custom ordered would not work bc the power supply was insufficient).<br/>
<br/>
Its not so much that my PC sucks but that my ISP is not ideal for online gaming. I have satellite since my phonelines were too horrible to even get dialup anymore (they spliced them up so bad that I could not even connect when attempting to dial in). The download is good most of the time but the upload is worse than dialup. On warcraft I&#39;m constantly above 1200ms latency. Believe it or not, warcraft is actually playable with that and loads much faster than EQ.<br/>

Man.. I&#39;m really babbling..<br/>

&gt;Here&#39;s what I have...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;eMachines W3050 Wal*Mart special (Hey, it was cheap and I needed something<br/>
&gt;bad)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2Ghz AMD processor<br/>
&gt;2GB Ram (upgraded from 512)<br/>
&gt;80GB HD <br/>
&gt;10GB HD (Added)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have the OS (WinXP Pro, it came with Home) loaded on the 10GB drive and<br/>
&gt;the 80 GB drive partitioned off with a 5GB partition dedicated as a swap or<br/>
&gt;paging file. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Granted this probably helps me load faster but can be a real headache to<br/>
&gt;configure for the average computer user who doesn&#39;t want to mess with all<br/>
&gt;that. Also when was the last time you defragged? That could help some.<br/>

&gt;Since it takes me 20 minutes to load I tend to just walk away during that<br/>
&gt;part. :-)<br/>
