<br>days ago. i was determined to not have her twinked. I&#39;m running around with
<br>no armor and just the weapon I started with... I got to lvl 2 just turning
<br>in bardic mail without having to kill anything. Then some guy walks up and
<br>hands me 2pp. I reluctantly took it. Then another guy came up and gave me a
<br>Shiny Brass Shield. At first I tried to refuse but then figured I could give
<br>it to one of my mom&#39;s alts. Then some guy started offering me splitpaw
<br>armor. I tried to pay him for it but he wouldn&#39;t let me. So I ended up with
<br>all this stuff by lvl 3... The gnoll hide lariat rules though. I can&#39;t
<br>complain.
