<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196707698">Since you most likely aggroed monsters tru walls they will not provide any<br/>
help at all. You can try but i&#39;m fairly sure this is a no go. Happens<br/>
everyday that larger raid parties get&#39;s whiped out in diffrent dungeons<br/>
(read: Chardok with more) due to buggs and GMs can&#39;t provide help since the<br/>
raid party don&#39;t have &quot;proof&quot; that the mob ported and trained mobs from the<br/>
other side of the dungeon (well, almost that is) cause the mob got pushed<br/>
into a furniture or something like that.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll try asking at in-game chat what I should do and see what the ingame<br/>
&gt; GMs<br/>
&gt; tell me.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I would repetition.  After all the GM said they would get back with you<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; they didn&#39;t.  I&#39;d petition and ask what she figured out.  Sorry.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was in E Freeport with my dark elf. I really worked on my faction so<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone conned at least dubious to me. I went into Seafarer&#39;s roost<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; made sure to con everyone. Nobody was KOS. Most were apprehensive to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; indifferent. I went to buy from a merchant. As soon as I finished the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; transaction something started hitting me. I turned around and couldnt&#39;<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it anywhere. I ran from the building and soon I was dead. Even looking<br/>
&gt; down<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at my corpse, whatever attacked me was not visible. I scrolled back up<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; see what I had done to piss it off. All the thing said before<br/>
&gt; attacking<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was &quot;How dare you!&quot;  It didn&#39;t say anything about me being a dark elf<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whatnot. I petitioned and the GM said that it probably attacked me<br/>
&gt; thru<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wall and promised to get back to me later after she looked into it.<br/>
&gt; She<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; never did. :-(<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The worst part was, I lost my level.. and I still haven&#39;t gotten back<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a week. I lost 3 blue bubbles of xp. :-(<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you folks think? Should I repetion?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; -Su<br/>
