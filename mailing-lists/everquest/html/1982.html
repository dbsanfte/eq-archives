      I finally got into Everquest by my 2.5 ghz computer I thought I <br/>
wanted to own Everquest I even Emailed Everquest support thing and <br/>
they didn&#39;t email me not even my brother for peat&#39;s sake I even <br/>
downloaded Directx 8.1 and I still could not log in! I got so mad that <br/>
I stated making chat servers that talk about this stupid thing that <br/>
happened monday! Then finally I downloaded Directx 8.1 again for a <br/>
total of 100mb!</div>
