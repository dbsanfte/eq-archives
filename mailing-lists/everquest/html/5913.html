<div>IMHO the role of a MT is to do enough damage to keep aggro without taking so much riposte damage that the healers hate them. For most characters this means using a slower, but powerful 2HS. Combine a good 2HS and the hate line of spells that SK get, and you have an awesome MT. Same deal with Pally healing, that nice Wave group-heal spell can be a huge aggro-yanker, so if you are MT then Heal away!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have a 67 papertank, I mean -- ranger, that I often use as MT for my usual experience group of ranger, monk, cleric, druid and chanter. In that instance I dual-wield fast, high-damage weapons as well as casting aggro-inducing spells&nbsp;to keep the monk from stealing aggro because he is a melee-machine. Because of the haste and fast weapons, even with defensive AA I take a fair amount of riposte damage, which means my cleric can get aggro with heals, which means more aggro-spells, etc. But it&#39;s how my play-style for this exp group has evolved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It&#39;s like Durgaa said, it&#39;s all about how you want to play your character. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>G&#39;luck!</div>

 2HS. So it&#39;s good to keep that skill maxed<br><br>Yet, pallies get Bash. In order to use Bash you have to carry a shield, in<br>which case 2HS is not possible. So it&#39;s good to keep 1HS up.<br><br>SK&#39;s I think get a similar ability, or maybe even Bash, but I dont play a SK<br>so I dont know for sure. But 1HS is also important to SK.<br><br>On the other hand, pallies and SK&#39;s usually work as pullers in groups, so<br>they have to have good Taunting abilities, and sometimes weapons they have<br>can help with taunt by doing more damage. Go with the weapon that helps<br>with that regardless of 1Hs or 2HS.<br><br>Just my two cents. <br><br>Wulfric</p>

I feel I am knowledgeable about many things in <br>regards to each class, race, etc. Yet, there is the one question <br>that evades me.. For the &quot;Knight&quot; classes, (Shadowknights and <br>Paladins), what is better..the traditional 1hs or the 2hs. I have <br>seen people, including my friends who do 2hs, and some that do 1hs. <br>What are the pros and cons of each...so I can decide which way to go <br>with my new pally...<br><br>thanks<br><br><br>Message: 5 <br>Date: Sun, 07 Nov 2004 18:12:06 -0700<br>From: &quot;Steven R.

 points made by Haly,<br><br>I have a Ranger thats lvl 34 and she currently dual wields. Now this is <br>a choice that I made which seemed to &quot;fit&quot; my toon and her personality. <br>I also have a Warrior who just uses a 2hs weapon. I plan on building up <br>his skills in the other areas too but a 2hs seems to &quot;fit&quot; him the best. <br>It&#39;s all about how you want to play YOUR toon, there is no right or <br>wrong way. One thing you may want to consider is that some weapons carry <br>some cool abilities. such as a damage bonus or spell. This may be <br>something you might want to keep in mind and also in some situations you <br>can benefit from these added bonuses. You asked a very good question, a <br>basic one and really IMHO is something that alot of players really don&#39;t <br>think about. They are more interested in getting the uber twink gear <br>which is nice but if you can&#39;t use it to it&#39;s full potential and to your <br>advantage, it&#39;s really not that uber.<br><br>Hope this
