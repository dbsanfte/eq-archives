<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777262096">When I was a level 14 druid someone on the list suggested Lavastorm. <br/>
I was there until level 19. The loot is pretty good, cash anything <br/>
from poor to fair, and the hunting interesting. Getting there was a <br/>
special adventure for me, as I am KOS in Neriak. I went in chamo and <br/>
levitated, turned left as I entered the forest, and kept to the zone <br/>
wall. There is a river half way through the zone, which I levved <br/>
across (not being a good swimmer) and kept on along the wall.<br/>
<br/>
I really liked the rock dervishes. Good cash and they dropped ore, <br/>
which sells well but is heavy. I would pick up a load until I was <br/>
encumbered even with strength, then port to a selling point. If you <br/>
can find someone to port the stuff out at a discount, the ore would <br/>
be profitable.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly solo, so that is what I did there. Lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting.<br/>
