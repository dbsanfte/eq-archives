<b>Subject:</b> Soloing a chanter <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866278541">Hi Guys<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a level 31 chanter (that&#39;s taken me three years to get to <br/>
31 - I remember when everquest was a 2 d game, and all the <br/>
characters looked really &#39;flat&#39;... and the elementals looked like <br/>
rocks with arms!)<br/>
<br/>
However due to my time differences to the rest of the world (ie. the <br/>
US) i rarely get the option to group.<br/>
<br/>
So my only option is to solo -- I&#39;ve been soloing my lower level <br/>
characters ok, but am finding the chanter a tad more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Sooooooooo....<br/>
<br/>
a) does anyone have advice about techniques that they&#39;ve used that <br/>
worked soloing an enchanter<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
b) can anyone please suggest a zone that would be good?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance<br/>
<br/>
T.</div>
