<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946279170">Just letting new members know that if your messages aren&#39;t going through<br/>
right away it is because they have to be approved by a moderator before they<br/>
can be posted.<br/>
I don&#39;t like having to do this, but it became necessary due to high volumes<br/>
of spam.<br/>
I need to fix the intro message to say this though. I&#39;ll have to remember to<br/>
do it later.<br/>
luv,<br/>
