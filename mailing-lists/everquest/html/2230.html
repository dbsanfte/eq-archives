www.eqtraders.com site.  Most comprehensive information so far. <br/>
Allakhazam can&#39;t keep up with all the new stuff and since eqtraders is<br/>
set up for the tradeskills and nothing else it is ideal for looking up<br/>
Luclin quests.  <br/>
<br/>
Luclin is the best place to play if you like to do quests and<br/>
roleplay.  I love the quests, lots of challenges and not as mindless<br/>
as just collecting stacks of things to get faction somewhere.  All of<br/>
the quests build on themselves and I love that.  Tho there is a<br/>
penalty if you loose all your stuff as a newbie, you gotta start over<br/>
if you loose your cloak cuz you need it to get better stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and check out that site<br/>
