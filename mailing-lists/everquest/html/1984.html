<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741948046">I was playing EQ in Lower Guk and was just about to leave to camp when the<br/>
enchanter in the group went for a pull. He did not tell us to run, nor did<br/>
he warn us that he was pulling almost half the zone. I was the main healer.<br/>
I saw him injured. So I healed him. Next thing I know, everything is on me.<br/>
I asked the backup healer to help me. Backuphealer did nothing. I died. I<br/>
was the only one who died though bc after healing and effectively taunting<br/>
mobs off the enc, he was able to mez. Right after I repopped after dying a<br/>
system message said half an hour til downtime to patch. So, I memmed spells<br/>
and was heading back for my corpse. 5 minutes later another system message<br/>
said &quot;Servers coming down, log out now&quot; I know this bc I did a /ti to<br/>
compare the times. So what does my group do? Rather than help me, they just<br/>
camped and left me there. So now I probably lost all of my stuff. I wish<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t lie about how long til patch time.<br/>
Sorry, just very frustrated.<br/>
