<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049751310">lol before I left, I died out somewhere I didnt know and I lost my plate<br/>
helm. btw im a caster... hehe<br/>
anyways, I set out to find my corpse. then I lost my plate wristbands....<br/>
then i started cursing AC, and I looked around and yelled free stuf, ran up<br/>
to someone, gave him my breastplate, staff, wand, spell reagents, and the<br/>
rest of my armor and hes like &quot;wow hehe thanks&quot;  and then I said back to EQ,<br/>
and let him know he can find more plate on the road in a few mins.<br/>
It was so easy to get the plate... exit main character, start a new<br/>
vagabond, sell all the stuff drop the 400 pyreals (thats what theyre called,<br/>
right?) then log in as main character delete vagabond start over. I got rich<br/>
doing that alot<br/>

&gt; I have to agree with you on AC.. I&#39;m part beta program, however i rarely<br/>
&gt; play it now.. its neat when you first start playing.. then you find out<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; the game just sucks.. :)  cant put it any other way.  Graphics are ok..<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; the world is so large and the distance between them is almost unbearable.<br/>
&gt; Its really annoying running for what seems forever, then losing your best<br/>
&gt; item you spent all your loot on miles from where you last bound yourself.<br/>
&gt; Hehe..  The AC world is so empty, almost as empty as their dungeons. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those that don&#39;t know.. when you die in AC you temporary lose some of<br/>
&gt; your stat numbers and..  your best item.   This item.. which is now<br/>
&gt; available to anyone walking by.  nice aye.  EQ example...  One minute you<br/>
&gt; have your rubi tunic, when you return to your corpse you find that a level<br/>
1<br/>
&gt; guy is now sporting your hard earned tunic.. Welcome to AC. hehe<br/>

&gt; AC and UO both suck ass. You should have tried ac last week during open<br/>
&gt; beta. I logged in and ran around for a while.. It seemed ok but all the<br/>
&gt; things I thought that were nice about it later on sucked<br/>
&gt; its annoying as hell plus the graphics suck, monster AI is sucky so you<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; solo your whole way to the top without getting hurt for 1 point of damage<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m rather fed up with Verant! They&#39;re constantly nerfing everything<br/>
&gt; ingame<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s worth while, or ignoring classes that need to be balanced or<br/>
&gt; &gt; upgraded! So in retrospect, I&#39;m looking to find greener pastures<br/>
&gt; elsewhere.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps someone out there knows of another game (other than AC and UO)<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt; perhaps a group who&#39;s programming their own game similar to EQ? If so,<br/>
&gt; &gt; please don&#39;t hesistate to drop me a line or two via email. Tks in<br/>
advance!<br/>
