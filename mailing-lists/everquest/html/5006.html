<div>Okay this question is very stupid but I haven&#39;t done a lot of the quests so I don&#39;t know. When you go to turn in your quest items, do you need to hail the person first? Because when I just gave them the items, they took them but I got no rewards. So I&#39;m guessing that happened because I didn&#39;t hail them first but wanted to be sure that was the reason.</div>
