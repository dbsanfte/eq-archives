    If I recall when you get DSl yoiu normally get the equip,emt with it.<br/>
When I went with DSL though the phone company I get a router that besides my<br/>
computer I can hook up 3 other computers though the back and it only cost me<br/>
$5/month.  I use Qwest. net asd Qwest is also the phnone company as well.<br/>
It is a nice setup.  Check with who you are going to use DSL with and see<br/>
what they say as welll.<br/>
