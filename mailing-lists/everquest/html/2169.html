<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Guild Stolen! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-531358954">Sorry to hear that. The first guild I was in seemed cool at first. Although<br/>
I should have questioned it a bit more considering they didn&#39;t even ask me<br/>
if I wanted to join. I was fighting a battle and an invite popped up. I<br/>
clicked NO. Bc it was getting in the way of my fight. It popped up again.<br/>
Again I hit NO. Then it popped up again so I clicked YES just to make it<br/>
stop popping up. At that point I was so new to the game I really didn&#39;t<br/>
understand what a guild was. Anyways, I made some good friends and was<br/>
having fun. But I noticed less and less of my friends were on.. I started<br/>
thinking about leaving. But my favorite person in the guild was a guild<br/>
officer and I didn&#39;t want to abandon her. Then I ran into my favorite person<br/>
in the guild and she was in a different guild. I asked what happened and she<br/>
said that there had been some bickering amongst some of the leading members.<br/>
She was very nice to me as always. Later on I was still thinking of leaving<br/>
but was having fun conversations with the guild leaders. But the very next<br/>
day I mentioned my favorite person and that I was sorry she left the guild.<br/>
They started trashtalking her. I told them that I had really enjoyed the<br/>
guild because of her. Then they told me the only reason I was still in the<br/>
guild was bc none of the officers were in the same zone with me to disband<br/>
me. they started trashtalking me and claimed that I had badmouthed the<br/>
guild. What had really happened was someone asked me how I liked the guild<br/>
and I said I liked it fine. I said it was cool. I happened to add that I<br/>
thought another guild was cool too. I didn&#39;t say it was better or anything,<br/>
just that they were both cool. So that person reported to my guildleaders<br/>
that I badmouthed the guild. See, I had an alt in the other guild. I figured<br/>
bc they are different characters it didnt&#39; really matter. After badmouthing<br/>
me the guild leaders told me I had a choice: I could leave the guild or take<br/>
my alts out of the other guild. I told them that it was really sad bc we&#39;d<br/>
been friends the day before. But they were being so pissy. so I asked them<br/>
how I could disband myself from the guild. and I did it right then. I went<br/>
straight to the other guild and they invited me in right away.<br/>
It&#39;s sad how guilds can be so fickle.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Yes, it can happen to you!  A few days ago, my hubby was having fun<br/>
&gt; with some guildmates when POOF! the guild was no more.  Took some<br/>
&gt; figuring out but apparently the person that originally started the<br/>
&gt; guild and was tagged as the &#39;owner&#39; wanted to make a new guild but was<br/>
&gt; unable because she was still listed as owning Circle of Majik.  She<br/>
&gt; had been forced out of the guild about a year ago because of her<br/>
&gt; thievery and lying.  She was unwelcome with the current leadership of<br/>
&gt; Gawabiwa and could not get control except by force.  She went to<br/>
&gt; Verant and had her leader powers reinstated then promptly dropped<br/>
&gt; everyone out of the guild without any kind of warning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What a dirty underhanded thing to do!  She didn&#39;t have to drop<br/>
&gt; everyone! or even anyone!  She could have come in and told everyone<br/>
&gt; before hand, instead she had to yank it out from under us.  It hurt us<br/>
&gt; to the core, but Gawabiwa has built a close knit guild and we are not<br/>
&gt; our name.  We will rebuild our guild and get ourselves back on track.<br/>
&gt;  We won&#39;t be having anything to do with whatever guild she has whether<br/>
&gt; called Circle of Majik or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have lots of support too.  Check out the guild forum page for this<br/>
&gt; controversy<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing I&#39;ve learned, if the current leadership doesn&#39;t own the<br/>
&gt; guild, the owner can do anything they please with out anybody else&#39;s<br/>
&gt; permission, and that is just plain wrong!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry about ranting so long, but I&#39;m mad about this.<br/>
