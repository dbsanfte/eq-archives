<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437216127">I have a question about dying my armor. Is there a website that has <br/>
the dye recipes and the steps I need to take to make dyes? I found <br/>
something on Allakazham but it just listed the components needed and <br/>
not what I need to do with them. I hunted in N. Karana to kill <br/>
beetles and get Plains Roots and put one at a time in a brewer along <br/>
with a water flask. I am up to 3 in brewing now LOL. But no dye. Do I <br/>
need to be putting a bottle or empty flask in there too with the <br/>
other stuff? And does anybody know what color Plains Dye is? Thanks <br/>
in advance for your help.<br/>
