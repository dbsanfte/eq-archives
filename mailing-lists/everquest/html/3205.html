<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-633837539">The fix is in. They haven&#39;t gotten the boats running, and the <br/>
shuttles just sit at the dock. However, on the dock is a temporary <br/>
NPC who will translocate you to Timorous Deep. The one in TD will <br/>
send you either way. I went to FV and set my bind point, but then <br/>
returned to SK to finish my goals of gathering a full toolbox of <br/>
Plains Pebbles and completing level 32. Dinged 33 last night, went to <br/>
Rivervale to put my things in order, and put my toon to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Su, I am not sure that a level 33 hanging around KC in DL is a very <br/>
survivable idea. I am more inclined to Frontier Mountains. <br/>
<br/>
I tend to approach the game in a semi-role-playing way. The game <br/>
allows us to go boldly almost anywhere, as death is no very big deal. <br/>
I prefer avoid game death, planning my moves with care and setting <br/>
incremental goals. I think Frontier Mountains is a good step.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep in mind your advice, however. As I level up I will still <br/>
need those Brute hides, and the KC hunting experience will be a good <br/>
later step.<br/>
