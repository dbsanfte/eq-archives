<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168411458">This is very true but the overhead required to address<br/>
and send packets with IP is stagering. 10k of info<br/>
would take four or five times that number of bits<br/>
transmited on the wire to get the info from A to B.<br/>
Also I dont think it matters what the PC or NPC has in<br/>
inventory only what they are carrying that affects<br/>
their appearence would be transfered and then only a<br/>
ref number to a texture like you say. Ofcourse none of<br/>
us can guess how the development team decided to code<br/>
each part. Maybe it transfers all info about<br/>
everything in the zone. Maybe just a little tiny bit<br/>
of info. I wonder if any of the developers has read<br/>
any of these posting. <br/>
What you say abou the modem lights is interesting. As<br/>
that would seem to discount the Line Speed theory if<br/>
your Send and Recieve lights never flicker during<br/>
zoning. Hmmm. I may have to try this and reconsider my<br/>
position. Ofcourse I dont own an external modem so I<br/>
will have to hunt one down. <br/>
Maybe we all just experience time differently and<br/>
zoning is really equal in all cases just our<br/>
preceptions of it are different. :)<br/>

&gt; the information about what<br/>
&gt; NPC and PC carries makes any difference on load<br/>
&gt; times... its nothing but a<br/>
&gt; few digits..  there is no item that is new every<br/>
&gt; item has a tag and the<br/>
&gt; approprite information is already contained on your<br/>
&gt; system.  Its just a<br/>
&gt; matter of sending compressed textual data to your<br/>
&gt; system.. You must<br/>
&gt; understand that 99 percent of what is loaded is<br/>
&gt; already on your system.<br/>
&gt; That is the only way to keep the latency down.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here try this...    if you have an external modem<br/>
&gt; look at the Send and<br/>
&gt; Receive lights..  when you are running around in a<br/>
&gt; zone the information is<br/>
&gt; transfered at a steady rate but when you zone its<br/>
&gt; almost no existant.. since<br/>
&gt; this is the case it is no way related to line speed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; p3-450 with 26400 to 28800 has a load time of 10<br/>
&gt; sec...<br/>
&gt; p2-333 with 56k has a load time of 15 sec... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; how do you explain that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; pipes are pipes no matter how fast the system you<br/>
&gt; cant transfer the data<br/>
&gt; faster then your line allows. but you see..  line<br/>
&gt; speed is not a factor in<br/>
&gt; zone loads..<br/>
