<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790574062">I&#39;d be glad to give you input. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:propellerheadus@...">propellerheadus@...</a> is email and ShaggyGooRoo is<br/>
AOL IM ID.  I&#39;m a middle age consulting professional,<br/>
so I probably have a different view that might be<br/>
valuable to your studies, and I&#39;ve been playing<br/>
computer games since Pong (yes I had a pong machine in<br/>
the &#39;70&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to start grad school in computer engineering<br/>
in January, so I can relate to your need :)  I think<br/>
EQ would be a great place to do a grad study on<br/>
economics.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is an odd request, but I am looking for some<br/>
&gt; Everquest players that <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t mind being interviewed either by IM, phone,<br/>
&gt; or if practical in person. I <br/>
&gt; am a graduate student at the Institute of Design at<br/>
&gt; Illinois Institute of <br/>
&gt; Technology in Chicago. For one of my classes,<br/>
&gt; entitled Observing Users, we <br/>
&gt; have to study a product and its users. Our group<br/>
&gt; chose Everquest because we <br/>
&gt; think that it is very interesting and complex. As a<br/>
&gt; retired online gamer I know <br/>
&gt; how much fun and involving the games can be. In<br/>
&gt; fact, I am very tempted to <br/>
&gt; jump into Everquest, but I am worried that I may<br/>
&gt; lose concentration on my <br/>
&gt; studies. If anyone is willing to devote a little of<br/>
&gt; their time to helping us out we <br/>
&gt; would really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are<br/>
&gt; poor grad students and will <br/>
&gt; not be able to compensate anyone who helps us out,<br/>
&gt; but we will very very <br/>
&gt; thankful. Thanks<br/>
