 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done this quest so many times my faction is apprehensive with <br/>
the corrupt guards and couldn&#39;t get any better with the good guys.  <br/>
Same with the Fayguard, some Dwarves and the Paladins in Freeport.  <br/>
<br/>
It is best to know who you&#39;re messing with.  I&#39;ve found that killing <br/>
Bandits and Raiders in NK helps with the bad guard faction.  I have a <br/>
friend who is running a Half-elf Rogue and he keeps close track of <br/>
his faction.  He can go anywhere!<br/>
<br/>
And back on topic, give him the teeth 4 at a time, and make sure you <br/>
have slots open.  And you do know about that second part of the quest?<br/>
