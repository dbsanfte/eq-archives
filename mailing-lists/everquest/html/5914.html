<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-90350069">1hs also allows for duel-wield. You can use two weapons to smack and usually have less delay than with a 2hs. If you are the main tank it is useful to be able to hit hard and fast. Sometimes having two proccing weapons is good. Remember to put the fastest weapon in your primay hand because it affects when you will be able to get in your secondary hit.<br/>

Learn them both, of course...always master every weapon skill open to you.<br/>
2hs is bigger hits but usually less aggro, useful for when you&#39;re not the MT<br/>
of a group or raid but want to get your licks in anyway. 1hs is faster,<br/>
typically more aggro, and allows you to use a shield for bash.<br/>
