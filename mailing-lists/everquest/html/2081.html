server they can&#39;t remove anything from your corpse. on a PVP server rules<br/>
are different, and (I think) depends on wether they killed you or not.<br/>

&gt; all the time and dying, it is starting to get to me, I don&#39;t want to<br/>

you&#39;re in is IMHO hard to learn since so few landmarks, but many people<br/>
feel is the best starting zone.<br/>

Corpse decay:<br/>
<br/>
for a nude body, it&#39;ll decay (vanish) in 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
for a low level char (think below 20?) body with items will decay in 30<br/>
minutes of online time(i.e. if logged in to game), or 24 hours if not<br/>
logged in (EQ not running on your machine)<br/>
<br/>
for a high level char (20+) body with items will decay in something like<br/>
24 hours online, or 1 week offline.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
note that &#39;online&#39; includes time logged in as other chars, and reportadly<br/>
even if in chat server.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors that after corpse decay items stick around slightly<br/>
longer(and could be picked up by anyone) but I&#39;ve never heard of this<br/>
actually happening, and I&#39;ve seen many a corpse decay, so I don&#39;t belive<br/>
it&#39;s true.</div>
