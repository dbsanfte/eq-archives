<div id="ygrps-yiv-512624745">The advice I was given was to look down, pull up your options and change the<br/>
distance you can see to the lowest setting (far plane?).  Then you can look<br/>
back up.  This lets me run around the bazaar with any view I want without a<br/>
big problem.<br/>
<br/>
I still consider myself a newbie, my highest guy is level 14.  To make some<br/>
plat you can hunt spiders and spiderlings for their silk.  Sell the silk in<br/>
bazaar.  I make 50-100 plat for one hour hunting with low level guys.  Not<br/>
exciting, but if you see something in the bazaar you really want it&#39;s an<br/>
option.  When I put silk up for sale it is almost always sold in the first<br/>
30 minutes.  When you are in a place that has spiders, check the shop<br/>
keepers frequently.  I can often buy spiderling silk for 5 silver from an<br/>
NPC then sell it for 4 plat in the bazaar!<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest you either pick a character you no longer want, or make a<br/>
new one and have them live in the bazaar.  When you get items you want to<br/>
sell, put it in the shared slots at the bank.  I have 2 boxes in the shard<br/>
slots so I can share 16 items.  When you want to go shopping, have your<br/>
bazaar guy do it and put the stuff in the bank.  This lets all your<br/>
characters sell, but you only buy one Traders Satchel.  It also keeps you<br/>
from having to run to the bazaar, you just need to find a bank.<br/>
<br/>
When selling, look up the item with /bazaar first.  See how much other<br/>
people are selling it for.  I think its funny when I see five people selling<br/>
an item for 50p and one person selling it for 150p.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest you stay away from people running &quot;casinos&quot;  Having<br/>
hung out in the bazaar for a while when shopping I have heard a bunch of<br/>
people get ripped off.  Some casinos are legit and will pay you when you<br/>
win, but until you know who they are and who the rip-offs are, hold you<br/>
cash.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Wow...thanks so much for the really helpful and encouraging<br/>
&gt; replies.  I feel so much more courageous ;o) than before...have<br/>
&gt; printed off all your tips and will study, yahhhhhhhhhh I have a<br/>
&gt; little more guidance now...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I made it to Luclin to the Bazaar, but may be stuck there now...feel<br/>
&gt; like a bobble head Paly doll from all the lag.  Oh, went to Kunark<br/>
&gt; and somehow have lived to tell about it...wandered to what is called<br/>
&gt; the wizzy towers or some sort of settlement...hugged the treeline<br/>
&gt; all the way back to the PoP spires...reallllly don&#39;t want to go back<br/>
&gt; there til&#39; I am about a level 60 ;o)!  I hope I can get the items I<br/>
&gt; want and get back to Greater Faydark sometime before spring...<br/>
