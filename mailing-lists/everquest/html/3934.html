<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578055202">Instead of having everyone pay $20-$50 for these Everquest guides for <br/>
sale on the internet, why don&#39;t we post them in the files section.  I <br/>
bought one, but I forgot the URL they gave me.  It was from <br/>
eqplatsecrets.com .  It just described that you can get more plat for <br/>
selling a lot of cheap items than a few expensive items.  It included <br/>
where to get Ry&#39; Gorr armor and stuff like that.<br/>
Also, please don&#39;t waste space in here by telling everybody how <br/>
worthless these guides are.  If you have one post it as a document in <br/>
the files section, and let everybody decide for themselves how useful <br/>
or worthless the guides are.</div>
