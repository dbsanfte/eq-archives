How do you know how much coin the other people loot though? Bc some people<br/>
can just loot stuff while you&#39;re medding and you&#39;ll never know that they<br/>
took all the coin off of it.<br/>

So I run into the same problem of not being near the corpse when it dies and<br/>
the group you&#39;re with is FFA. I really don&#39;t mind free for all loot,<br/>
provided that everyone understands no one needs to get greedy. By the sound<br/>
of it, you were hunting in Highkeep, a personal favorite of mine. Most<br/>
groups that are not ffa usually go alphabetically and you keep looting until<br/>
you get a total of 2pp, a bronze or FS weapon or armor, or some combination<br/>
of ore (down in the warrior and raider rooms).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think any looting order is any better than others. I think it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>completely depends on the people you&#39;re grouped with. Some people can do the<br/>
ffa loot and no one ever loots too much and it works smoothly. And in the<br/>
alpha loot, as long as everyone&#39;s honest, that works well too.<br/>

&gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>
&gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>
&gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>
&gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>

&gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
&gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
&gt; Just wondering.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>
&gt; people cooperate.<br/>
