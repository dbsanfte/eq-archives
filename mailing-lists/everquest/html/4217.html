 </span></blockquote>Intelligence has NOTHING to do with your melee skills, or your Shaman <br/>
capabilties. Dexterity is what will influence how fast you can learn <br/>
your spear. Intelligence in itself may affect how well you learn your <br/>
tradeskills, but that is a subject that has been in debat eof rages <br/>
and still is now.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.</div>
