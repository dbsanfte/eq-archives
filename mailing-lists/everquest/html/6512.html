<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033051021">I have a kitty character living on Luclin in the Everquest game. <br/>
Imagine my disappointment when I looked up at Luclin in the sky in <br/>
Everquest II from the planet below. Euuuuw! My neighborhood has some <br/>
major real estate issues.<br/>
<br/>
Ok. Now I&#39;m pisseed off at the gods. How dare they allow my <br/>
neighborhood to get demolished!? Somebody blew up Luclin while those <br/>
divine beurocrates were out taking a lunch break. Don&#39;t they have <br/>
pagers? Oooh the humanity!<br/>
<br/>
On a slightly more serious note, the kitties in Everquest II took a <br/>
nose dive in their appearence. The character customization features <br/>
let you personalize you characters better. That&#39;s welcome. But I <br/>
still don&#39;t like the way the Everquest II kitties looks. They just <br/>
don&#39;t look good.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody decided that having a free public portal system to <br/>
everywhere was just too easy. That seems to be gone from the game. <br/>
Now you have to look for ships, portal spells and people who can port <br/>
you. Travel is a little bit less easy. I have mixed feeling about <br/>
that. On one hand it makes the game feel more realistic if travel <br/>
isn&#39;t too easy. On the other hand, sometimes I just want to go some <br/>
place without a lot of bother about it.<br/>
<br/>
Will I buy the game? I have mixed feelings about that. The pluses and <br/>
minuses balance out in both games so that I don&#39;t like Everquest II <br/>
significantly better than Everquest. I also don&#39;t like looking up the <br/>
the sky and seeing my home in ruins. The negatives in Everquest II <br/>
are strong enough that I might buy a short subscription only. I doubt <br/>
that I&#39;ll stick with it.<br/>
