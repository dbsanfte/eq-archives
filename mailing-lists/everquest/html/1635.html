<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042608422">Maybe. Some people are just too dense to listen to anyone. I had some people<br/>
who were ninja-looters in my group. One guy in particular. He kept looting<br/>
while we were still fighting. I told him to stop it. (with my female alt).<br/>
He tried to claim he had only looted once corpse but I watched him loot 3 in<br/>
a row. I told him to stop looting and let others have a chance. Still he<br/>
kept hogging loot. We killed a Lego. He sat back and didn&#39;t do much while we<br/>
killed it but he ran up and looted. He looted a bronze weapon. I said I<br/>
wanted to roll for it. Everyone rolled, I got the highest roll. Not only did<br/>
he not roll, but he refused to give the brozne weapon up. So he got df<br/>
shoulderpads AND the bronze weapon. Finally, we killed the orc weaponsmith.<br/>
I said his name and &quot;Do NOT loot the weaponsmith&quot;. He looted it. I<br/>
immediately disbanded him. He stood around for awhile and didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
realize he wasn&#39;t in group until he tried to loot something. Then he asked<br/>
to be allowed back into group. I said &quot;no&quot;. I think he was shocked that a<br/>
female character was so &quot;harsh&quot;. I only wish I had disbanded him before he<br/>
could loot the Lego.<br/>
