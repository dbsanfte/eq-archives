<div id="ygrps-yiv-739125151">Hello everyone...I was pleased to stumble across this group in my <br/>
ramblings.  I have recently begun adventuring on the Morden Rasp <br/>
server.  Find the land of Norrath exciting and challenging.  But, I <br/>
am at that point with my characters (28 Ranger, 18 Cleric, 18 <br/>
Enchanter, 12 Shaman) that almost demand grouping in order to get <br/>
anywhere (or any of the treasures!)<br/>
<br/>
As you may have gathered I play ALOT.  If anyone would be interested <br/>
in grouping with me, please let me know.  Char names:  Kenaf, <br/>
Montcurie, Coro, Kitzan)<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed the sudden disappearnce of guilds too.  How about <br/>
this...why don&#39;t we start a guild of our own?  I would even be <br/>
willing to start a toon on a different server if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the group...hope to hunt with you in the near future.</div>
