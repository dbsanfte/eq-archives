<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793389749">In any case that any of these actually worked without the use of a <br/>
spell (I mean really fly through the air, whats to say the &quot;tip&quot; <br/>
isn&#39;t just buy a ring of levitation, find a high part to start and <br/>
run off) then the other possiblities is they are hacks or they are <br/>
random pathing issues, or they are basically just fancy use of hot <br/>
keys.   <br/>
<br/>
This is the *same person* who was previously selling a guide on how <br/>
to make plat (one I bought when I first started playing because I <br/>
was young and stupid then)- it basically was a bunch of quests I <br/>
could find on Allakazam that were repeatable and &quot;tips&quot; like kill <br/>
things and sell the items to players.<br/>
<br/>
In all cases, every guide like this in the past has been filled with <br/>
out dated, in accurate, or information that is not always <br/>
repeatable. <br/>
<br/>
An exploit of a bug is only useful if you can consistently repeat it.<br/>

secrets manual that you can download for $20.   And some of the <br/>
things you list in your spoilers sound more like hacks than things <br/>
SOE is planning on implementing.  So not to deter anyone from buying <br/>
this download, but I&#39;d be very careful and double check to make sure <br/>
the things listed are legal and not going to get your account <br/>
revoked.<br/>
