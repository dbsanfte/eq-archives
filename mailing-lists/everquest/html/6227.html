<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426264948">In Starwars Galaxies you don&#39;t have to be a fighting class at all (but it does help to gather resources). You can be an artisan who can go out and sample for ore and stuff with survey devices. Then you can go back and craft things. You can raise skill by doing quests where they give you the components, you craft them and give them to another npc and then you get paid for it. Dancers get tips. There are also musicians. Watching/listening to dancers and musicians gives you buffs. As an artisan you can build crafting stations, clothing, armor, weapons, houses, ships, etc. As an Entertainer (which is dancer/musician/image designer) you can play musical instruments, dance, and change people&#39;s physical appearances. I have a master image designer/furniture builder on one of the servers. On another I have a master dancer.<br/>

&gt;You can actually be *dancers* in the Star Wars game?  Good lord, if we could do that in EQ I&#39;d never get ANYTHING done.  lol.  Especially with the way some of my weapons sparkle...I&#39;d be a one-monk rave!  lol.<br/>

&gt;Here is more of Balgosa Windspire&#39;s stuff.   He&#39;s done quite a few.  &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; and &quot;Ice Man Cometh&quot; are good too, but &quot;Fett&#39;s Vette&quot; is still the best.   I like the version that shows MC Chris performing the song cause you can actually understand the lyrics.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Ahahaha! I remember that one. &quot;LEEROOOY Dragon time!&quot; I love when his <br/>
&gt;&gt; friend is like &quot;you&#39;re such an idiot&quot;.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Did you see the StarWars Galaxies one at big-boys.com?<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think it&#39;s at www.big-boys.com/achrive3 somewhere around there. My <br/>
&gt;&gt; brother was singing &quot;my backpack&#39;s got jets&quot; for a few days after seeing <br/>
&gt;&gt; it.<br/>
