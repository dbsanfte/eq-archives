<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The difference is that you started with a full 
group and had already requested an adventure before you entered the zone.&nbsp; 
The game accounts for things such as death and LinkDeath.&nbsp; As long as the 
group stays at least 2 people intact&nbsp; AFTER the adventure is requested you 
can still enter the zone.&nbsp; However, you cannot request an adventure by 
yourself or enter a zone without having requested an adventure.&nbsp; You will 
simply get a message staing perhaps you should try finding other adventurers 
like yourself.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Consequently depending on your class, you are 
right, it could be entirely possible to solo an adventure zone.&nbsp; Melee 
types without some sort of snare or crowd control will most likely have a tough 
time doing this, but a druid, a bard, a cleric or an enchanter might 
theoretically be able to pull it off.&nbsp; Druids don&#39;t have any kind of mez 
that works indoors, but they do have root and snare which helps a lot.&nbsp; As 
long as root doesn&#39;t break they can concentrate on one while kiting 
another.&nbsp; Bards have some pacifying songs and songs which cause direct 
damage so weaving those could possibly solo as well.&nbsp; Clerics get Pacify at 
a higher level and combined with root could probably do okay.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know 
much about enchanters except that they are the ultimate crowd control.&nbsp; 
With their ability to mezmerise mobs and even groups of mobs, they are hella 
good to have along on an adventure, plus with mind candy like C1 (level 30), C2 
(level 45??), and C3 (level 60) they help a group a lot with mana 
regeneration.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So at a normal risk adventure, I think it could be 
done.&nbsp; Some mobs have the ability to complete heal themselves which makes 
it damn difficult to kill them so you&#39;d really have to watch out for 
those.&nbsp; Otherwise, good luck on your next attempt to solo.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Hey all,<br><br>Oddly enough you could solo one (well go 
  into one alone). I was in a group of 5 where suddenly we lost two people 
  (before even getting to adv start) and then the other two folk decided to bag 
  the adventure. So, just for Ha-Has, I took my shaman into the adv to do some 
  foraging (some of the rarer forages sell for 50-100pp a pop on the Nameless). 
  Lack of common sense got the better of me and I tried some of the mobs... the 
  first multi-pull sent me running for the exit... :)<br><br>Ciao,<br>Miracht

  &lt;flaumigevylke@...&gt;<br>&gt; Subject: Re: 
  Adventuring<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Well first you have to make sure you have the 
  expansion Lost Dungeons of<br>&gt; Norath, once you have that then you join a 
  band of adventures of around your<br>&gt; level, maximum of 6 member with a 
  spread of no more then 7 levels between<br>&gt; the highest and lowest. The 
  group leader then goes and gets the adventure<br>&gt; for the group, sorry but 
  they won&#39;t let a solo in and you all have to have<br>&gt; the expansion 
  enabled and have your adventure stones. Just one way they have<br>&gt; of 
  making you group with people to have fun and see naked as someone<br>&gt; 
  possibly all of you will die on it at some time or another. You&#39;ll have 
  a<br>&gt; main looter who loots and then sells after the adventure and splits 
  the<br>&gt; proceeds between you all, items drop from the mobs which are no 
  drops and<br>&gt; you roll on them, there&#39;s also some pretty nice things drop 
  that you&#39;ll want<br>&gt; to roll on.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;
