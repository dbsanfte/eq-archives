<div><font size="2">I have about 30 chars on 7 different servers going at once and 
I have a BLAST! My main is 53 warrior on the Nameless, which I have all 8 slots 
filled on, and I have chars on Xev, Vallon, Rallos, and others. It&#39;s defintiely 
worth it to play various chars, esp low levels in different areas. It keeps you 
from being &quot;burned out&quot;. I&#39;ve got 6 chars on Nameless under 10 in commons and 
gfay area and if I played one steady I woudl go insane from boredom! So I play 
my 53 warrior in KC, my 15 war in Unrest, and run CB, Befallen, everything I can 
find</font></div>

  Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [EverQuest] Multiple characters<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; Is it better to build more than one character at a time? Mine is only 
  <br>&gt; a level 6 halfling warrior, but I have invested quite a bit of time 
  <br>&gt; in just getting this far. I know I can build another character a bit 
  <br>&gt; faster based on what I have learned, but is that investment of time 
  <br>&gt; worthwhile?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I do have a second character just 
  started, but that was only <br>&gt; something to play when the area my 
  halfling was camped in was shut <br>&gt; down for repairs. I am thinking more 
  on building a second character <br>&gt; for tactical purposes.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; For example, I wandered out of Rivervale to High Hold Pass one day, 
  <br>&gt; and was slaughtered by Orcs. I managed to sneak back to recover my 
  <br>&gt; stuff, but could not get out fast enough. I gave up that corpse, and 
  <br>&gt; concentrated on building in Misty Thicket.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; My 
  thought is to build a character over time just to get through High <br>&gt; 
  Pass Hold. My greater interest is in the warrior working his way <br>&gt; 
  across Misty Thicket. Am I wasting valuable game time on this second <br>&gt; 
  character? High Pass Hold seems extremely difficult, and might not be <br>&gt; 
  worth the effort until much later in the game.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Any 
  thoughts?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Samwiseguy<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
