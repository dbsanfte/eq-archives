  <div><br></div><tt>Ive got a question for the list. <br><br>Its around the 
  account is personal and cant be exchanged with outhers bla<br>bla. I do agree 
  very much that you shall keep your account safe and all<br>this, but in a 
  large scale operations guild its IMPOSSIBLE to not share your<br>account with 
  a few people that you trust. This is essential to day to day<br>operations. 
  You choose a couple of people who you trust and hand them 
  your<br>info.<br><br>1 example. Guild property and funding. A single person 
  cannot manage the<br>trades/funds/hand out of items for the guild. This would 
  be a full time job<br>for 1 person in my guild. Our solution is a separate 
  account shared among<br>the officers with mules for cash / gems / spells / 
  items. On our<br>messageboard transactions take place and a member can ask any 
  officer to<br>complete a transaction once its validated on board. This is 
  clearly against<br>the EULA but since there are no support for these types of 
  operations with a<br>central store for a guild we have not found a better way 
  to handle work like<br>this. How do others solve these types of 
  problems?<br><br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: Su

  531<br><br><br>Well, any exchange of accounts is forbidden by the terms of 
  service. Part of<br>the reason for this is that the person buying the account 
  may get swindled.<br>They may pay for the account only to find that the 
  character is deleted or<br>the person changes passwords on them and so forth. 
  I&#39;ve heard of this<br>happening. Or they may get an account that has many 
  soulmarks for bad<br>behavior. Also, people who work for Verant and EQ have 
  been invited to this<br>list. If they see the people advertising they are 
  selling their accounts<br>here, they may bust the person who is trying to sell 
  it.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; Since he is selling his account for 
  Platnum (15k, which I don&#39;t have) is<br>that against the rules? I thought it 
  was just if it was for $$$?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Message:

  Nameless<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I would like to remind people that anything that 
  violates the terms of<br>&gt; service of EQ is not allowed on this mailing

  it here.<br>&gt; luv,<br>&gt; -Su (List Owner)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; If 
  anyone wants this account, I am done with it. Time to try<br>&gt; &gt;
