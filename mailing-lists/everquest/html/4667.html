I just bought a Shardtooth&#39;s Flayed Skin, the AC is supposed to be 14<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3768">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3768</a> and <br/>
when I wear it, my AC goes up by only 17.<br/>
<br/>
I sent a petition in game about it and the GM told me <br/>
to ask other Enchanters about it? That was no help. Has anyone else <br/>
had stats show up in their inventory window different than what the <br/>
item is supposed to show?</div>
