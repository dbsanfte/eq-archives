<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180079867"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Wow...thank you!  That will be quite helpful.  I&#39;ve already got 2 songs<br/>
&gt; that I hang between till the one fades (being only 3rd level, and the 2nd<br/>
&gt; level one ends when you quit singing it.)<br/>
&gt; Do the effects of your songs last longer when you quit singing them as you<br/>
&gt; go up in level?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think so. I think the songs last longer after ending them once you get<br/>
higher. My lvl 11 has her songs continue for about 3 seconds after she stops<br/>
singing them.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; A question on the 3rd level song, the Jig.  It says I feel this energy go<br/>
&gt; thru my body, I was wondering what the effects of the song are?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It effects the yellow meter. If you want to getup your swimming skill and<br/>
not get fagigued, play that song while you swim. So if you run out of food<br/>
or drink and your stamina is going down, play that song. It does about the<br/>
same thing as the cleric song &quot;Extinguish fatigue&quot; only it is constant.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, and don&#39;t play the AoE song in a mob filled area.  Ouch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And certainly don&#39;t play it near guards or npcs you don&#39;t want to fight.<br/>
luv,<br/>
