<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087132722">Well first off if your a first time player. Good luck geeting a druid <br/>
to help. Secound i could get power lvled to 30 but ass naked if need <br/>
be. Gear just makes it eaasyer on the druid. However you find  druid <br/>
to lvl you and Useually  that well toss you crap out of the bank at <br/>
you (what iam wearing)in fact my pants ar ac 4. and as far as zones <br/>
go well i just bought the plat cd set and it has all but one zone on <br/>
it. 90 percent of the sets you buy today well have these zones if by <br/>
chance you find the origanle eq game in the bargain  bin its still <br/>
cheaper to buy the platinum cd set. so IAM sorry you cant seem to <br/>
find a druid to help you. the thread was on how to. not how to get <br/>
some one to do so. Iam an experinced player, and know how where and <br/>
when.  As a rogue iam grp dependent on groups yet i can still solo. <br/>
only by knowledge and bandaids lot of bandaids. if your a casual <br/>
player with one or two hours a week to play try a staarting a druid <br/>
and then you could power lvl yourself.<br/>
