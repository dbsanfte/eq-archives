<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763225690">I don&#39;t know your level but as higher level you wont find those groups all<br/>
the time. Hell, it&#39;s even hard when you are in a guild. I&#39;m one of the<br/>
leaders in a guild that has 150+ members and most are 50+, however, you will<br/>
notice problems when you get higher and you&#39;ve noticed that EQ ain&#39;t that<br/>
fun. You wanna do the real stuff like dragons, planes and more &quot;uber&quot; stuff.<br/>
That&#39;s when guilds comes handy. At lower levels it&#39;s more like a community,<br/>
but still great tho, you will get to know alot more people via your guild<br/>
and hopefully you will join a good guild. As for me, i like to chat with<br/>
folks all the time, i wouldnt manage to stick to EQ (already hard as it is<br/>
with AO this close) without a guild.<br/>

&gt; Subject:	[EverQuest] Guilds vs. Solo<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have seen a lot of people with guild names on my server and I was really<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; wondering what the benefit of being in a guild would be to going it<br/>
&gt; without <br/>
&gt; one???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I mean I can always find someone to group with... or solo it on the blue&#39;s<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and blacks....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other then maybe another aspect added to the role playing game what<br/>
&gt; benefit <br/>
&gt; do you recieve from a Guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ok got to run just wondering<br/>
&gt; <br/>
