<div id="ygrps-yiv-587429436">Timing in Everquest is made up by ticks. One tick is 6 seconds. Bard songs<br/>
are either instants or 3 ticks long. If you manage to time it perfectly with<br/>
the ticks on the server you can hold 4 songs up without any misses. This<br/>
require a lot of training and a very good connection AND a very good sense<br/>
of timing.<br/>
<br/>
Three songs is the norm and all bards worth the name should be able to<br/>
handle this with an ok con if you put your mind to it.<br/>
<br/>
The macro that was described works ok in non-combat situations. In combat<br/>
its a lot better to just twist manually. If you get a missed note in the<br/>
beginning of the macro you cant start any songs at all until the macro<br/>
finishes which is not acceptable in combat.<br/>
<br/>
If you read some of the articles written by Thott (guildleader of Afterlife<br/>
on Mithaniel Marr) he does a good job in describing timings and mechanics of<br/>
a bard. <br/>
<br/>
Some people claim to be able to do 5 songs but to my knowledge this is not<br/>
possible without &quot;faking it&quot; with for example Breath of Harmony that procs<br/>
&quot;NivÂ´s melody of preservation&quot;. Thus you can hold 5 effects in the air and<br/>
REALLY impress people around you. just hotkey 4 songs and hit them in order<br/>
and keep it timed. Thats the life of a bard. Also Instruments boost the<br/>
effect of many songs VERY much. Many times its worth NOT meleeing and just<br/>
twist songs and sometimes instruments too. Always remember - youre not a<br/>
tank. After playing bard over two years now i can say the best thing about<br/>
bards is that they are good at minimizing downtime. And boy downtime sucks.<br/>
<br/>
To time the ticks are used by other classes aswell but not as much as the<br/>
bards. But some casters use tick-med as a technique.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Playing more than one song at a time is possible (and as far as I<br/>
&gt; know not a bug, just a matter of being able to hit the keys fast<br/>
&gt; enough) because the effects of a song continue for a few seconds after<br/>
&gt; you stop singing it.  So, starting and stopping and restarting songs fast<br/>
&gt; enough will allow you to have multiple song effects active all at the same<br/>
&gt; time.  I think 3 songs at a time is what most people try to manage.  The<br/>
&gt; best method I&#39;ve seen to do this is by programming a hotkey that would<br/>
&gt; look something like this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /pause 30;/sing 1<br/>
&gt; /pause 30;/sing 2<br/>
&gt; /pause 30;/sing 3<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you hit this hotkey, it would start song in spell slot 1, wait 3<br/>
&gt; seconds, start song in spell slot 2, wait 3 seconds, then start song in<br/>
&gt; spell slot 3.  When you notice the effects of song 1 fading, you hit the<br/>
&gt; hot key again and it starts over.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a lvl 5 bard char which I have only played a little.  If anyone<br/>
&gt; knows of better ways to twist songs I would like to hear them.<br/>
