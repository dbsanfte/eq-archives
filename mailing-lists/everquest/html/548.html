<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002471763">My turn to rant (and I know this is going to piss some people off, but I<br/>
gotta say it)<br/>
<br/>
1.  &quot;[Verant] could have programmed the game with more logging&quot;???(see<br/>
below)  Please.  I&#39;m going to have to come to Verants defense now.  Any<br/>
idea how much more lag there would be if there was more logging with 50<br/>
- 100 in a zone?  Verant used a nice median between logs so as to not<br/>
bog the game down more.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Everyone is complaining that there character traits and skills are<br/>
unfair.  Boo hoo.  REAL LIFE is not fair.  And Verant is trying to make<br/>
the game as real as possible. (Muffin anyone?) If your Race or Class is<br/>
that bad that you feel you need to complain everyday then change.  Hey!<br/>
No one&#39;s complaining about being a ranger or paladin, so lets all be<br/>
rangers and paladins.  Even the damn wizards who are kill stealers are<br/>
complaining for some reason that their class is unfair (Note today&#39;s<br/>
EQ&#39;Lizer).  Playing a unfair character or hard character is sweet,<br/>
because when you succeed, you prove your own abilities.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Boo hoo.  Make Poison and Apply Poison doesn&#39;t work yet and I can&#39;t<br/>
sneak up behind a creature undetected and backstab for 100 points<br/>
everytime.  Wow, rogues really have it rough.  They&#39;ve only said a<br/>
million times that they are working on these problems, so chill out and<br/>
enjoy what your rogue can do.  And if he (she) still can&#39;t do anything,<br/>
then that probably reflects your intelligence more that your character&#39;s<br/>
abilities.  (And as a side note, I did like the Rogue Protest on Solusek<br/>
Ro.)<br/>
<br/>
4. My human warrior sucks at level 20.  Wow Einstein.  Did you ever<br/>
wonder why the first 15 levels were so easy?  This class was designed<br/>
for Buffoons with attention deficit syndrome.  You were supposed to be<br/>
bored of this guy after 5 levels.  Try playing a hard character.<br/>
They&#39;re the ones that pay off in the end.<br/>
<br/>
5. Where are the new zones and other planes?  The game was not designed<br/>
for people playing 24-7.  The creators themselves said this.  Try<br/>
getting some sunlight.  They&#39;ll come soon enough.<br/>
<br/>
In general to all the people complaining, do you have any idea how much<br/>
code has gone into this game?  I find that the few bugs that do exist<br/>
with over 20,000 people playing at any given time is quite remarkable.<br/>
And Verant continues to improve the game!  If anyone knows of a better<br/>
overall game, then why are you playing Everquest?<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying Verant is perfect, but my only issue with Verant is I&#39;d<br/>
like a better status of what they are working on and their proposed<br/>
deadlines.<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to Verant.  I&#39;ve wasted my summer away so far on Everquest, but<br/>
I&#39;m loving every minute!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; See, that&#39;s really the problem.  Verant &quot;Doesn&#39;t know&quot; if you are<br/>
&gt; lying or<br/>
&gt; at least that&#39;s what they claim.  I really want to know why there is a<br/>
&gt; message every few minutes on my screen telling me that my character is<br/>
&gt; saved<br/>
&gt; if they refuse to use that info to help players who have been<br/>
&gt; destroyed by<br/>
&gt; bugs that should have been squashed in beta.  I&#39;ve been lucky and have<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; lost items due to bugs, it&#39;s happened to a good friend of mine, he<br/>
&gt; just gave<br/>
&gt; up that character, didn&#39;t want to deal with that crap.  Verant doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem<br/>
&gt; to understand that we pay money to play this game and we shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to<br/>
&gt; &quot;just deal&quot; with these kind of programming mistakes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They could have programmed the game with more logging to know what<br/>
&gt; happened<br/>
&gt; when a character dies and know what they had when they died so they<br/>
&gt; could be<br/>
&gt; restored without worry that you really traded your items to a friend<br/>
&gt; before<br/>
&gt; dieing on the boat but they made the decision not to, apparently, or<br/>
&gt; to not<br/>
&gt; use that data and instead they just have their GM&#39;s give the same line<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; garbage every time that they can&#39;t do anything.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the biggest problems with this game right now is their severe<br/>
&gt; lack of<br/>
&gt; customer service and their lack of being responsible for the bugs in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; game.  BAH<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now.<br/>

&gt; Not to be rough about it, but frankly you&#39;re shit out of luck.  I&#39;m on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; reimbursement list too - have been for over a month now.  Just go out<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; hunt little newbie-ish things to get enough cash for food, and work<br/>
&gt; your way<br/>
&gt; back to where you were.  Or if you&#39;re lucky like me, friends will help<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; to recoup your loss (Thanks again Natalia, Arith, Lanor).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Verant has no way of knowing if you&#39;re lying or not...and frankly, if<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; manage to bug them into giving it to you - let me know...I think I<br/>
&gt; lost a<br/>
&gt; shiny metallic robe too....<br/>
