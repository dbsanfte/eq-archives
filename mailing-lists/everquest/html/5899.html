<div id="ygrps-yiv-206344897">My original main is a DE SK named Cynfyn on the Saryrn Server (some of you<br/>
may remember him  and some of you may not know him at all)  And as Wulfric<br/>
stated SK do get bash  and being hybrid like the Paladin have the option to<br/>
use practically all the melee weaponry.  myself personally i hate using 2<br/>
handed weaponry just because I like that extra ac I get form using a shield.<br/>
But as was stated by someone else here  making use of the 2hs skill is good<br/>
to do  for non MT/raid situations where you don&#39;t have to keep the agro but<br/>
wanna add to the damage quota.   basically its all  what I like to call<br/>
&quot;Taster&#39;s Choice&quot; in regards to what you wanna use for melee. There is no<br/>
real wrong way  in regards to your choice of melee.  Do what you feel<br/>
comfortable doing and go with it. but at least keep up yer skills in those<br/>
area&#39;s that you don&#39;t use much just  as a fall back type situation or if you<br/>
happen to come across a weapon with some really neat stats that you decide<br/>
you want to make use of  later on<br/>

&gt; Learn them both, of course...always master every weapon skill open to you.<br/>
&gt; 2hs is bigger hits but usually less aggro, useful for when you&#39;re not the<br/>
&gt; MT<br/>
&gt; of a group or raid but want to get your licks in anyway. 1hs is faster,<br/>
&gt; typically more aggro, and allows you to use a shield for bash.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Greetings....<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I have been playing EQ for a long time, played nearly every class<br/>
&gt;&gt; with most races. I feel I am knowledgeable about many things in<br/>
&gt;&gt; regards to each class, race, etc. Yet, there is the one question<br/>
&gt;&gt; that evades me.. For the &quot;Knight&quot; classes, (Shadowknights and<br/>
&gt;&gt; Paladins), what is better..the traditional 1hs or the 2hs. I have<br/>
&gt;&gt; seen people, including my friends who do 2hs, and some that do 1hs.<br/>
&gt;&gt; What are the pros and cons of each...so I can decide which way to go<br/>
&gt;&gt; with my new pally...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; thanks </span></blockquote></div>
