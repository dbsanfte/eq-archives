<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051467024">Wow!   Lots of good stuff...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone for all of your replies.  <br/>
I wonder if anyone at Verant is on the lists?<br/>
(Get a soda or something stronger, this is a lengthy reply)<br/>
<br/>
If I was asking a pure newbie question, there is another <br/>
mailing list for them, but I haven&#39;t seen much activity.<br/>
<br/>
In this reply please consider my situation:  <br/>
Since the non-SB Sound patch went  &#39;live&#39;, my system <br/>
freezes after 5-15 minutes of play on Veeshan.  <br/>
I have posted numerous messages on EQVault&#39;s Bug board.<br/>
I also recently got a direct reply from John Smedley.<br/>
I figured rather than be frustrated, try Test last weekend.  <br/>
Heck, John posted on EQVault news for us to give them<br/>
feedback of problems.  I love to rant as you can see.<br/>
Either due to the lower head count, my 1am pst on time <br/>
or the potential of a test patch fixing my problem, I enjoyed <br/>
playing for well over an hour, but I still froze.  <br/>
I had hoped with the April 20 migration that my freezing<br/>
would return to a bareable once per hour.<br/>
<br/>
EQ doesn&#39;t lock-up or just drop where I could Ctl-Alt-Del, <br/>
my system freezes.  Mouse stops moving etc.. <br/>
Reboots take about as long as a a full game to load from <br/>
first click.   Try that 3 times an hour.<br/>
 <br/>
First - for those who get individual posts, try setting digested.<br/>
For those who already have digested, please consider shorting<br/>
the &quot;Original&quot; messages you quote to just the juicy parts.   <br/>
For the rest that are confused, read the Number 27 digest to <br/>
see what a 2 line reply looks like when 3 messages are tagged<br/>
to the end of each post.  <br/>
PLEASE double check before replying to THIS post!<br/>
<br/>
Vespair - I&#39;m not a pure newbie, I also play on Simtronics&#39;<br/>
Dragonrealms as well as numerous other text MUDS, so <br/>
my expectations of development are still with using my <br/>
first, a 4th level Cleric in Freeport now a member of the<br/>
Brotherhood of Balance guild.   Their squire quest has <br/>
been a painful one with 10 minute reboots, but the <br/>
guild leader Myrddin is very supportive of my success.<br/>
<br/>
On test, I started a Paladin to challenge more Warrior like<br/>
disiplines, but still Holy based.  For the last 3 days I&#39;ve<br/>
been stuck in the Attic of the Sea Farer&#39;s Roost.<br/>
I have submitted /Bug reports and when on, /Petition.<br/>
My quandry, I don&#39;t think anyone is there to react.<br/>
Being the ONLY player in East Freeport, I suppose<br/>
I&#39;ll have to let my my character starve, just to get out.<br/>
<br/>
The common feature of both was being Human and homed <br/>
in Freeport.   Someone posted on Bugs, that there maybe <br/>
a problem with freezing while in Freeport and suggested that <br/>
I pick another home city/race.   Thus Dark Elf in Neriak.<br/>
My only problem has been AOL carrier drop and Server not<br/>
responding, but that is NOT Verant&#39;s problem.<br/>
Awhile back I also tried and then purged a Tree Elf Ranger <br/>
in Kelethin, {but that&#39;s a silly place (MP Holy Grail - Camelot)}.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Vespair (Vesheen Server)<br/>
&gt; maybe you should pick another server other than Test Server... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>PWipes on test don&#39;t bother me.  Traveling on big ships to far<br/>
away places is a bit risky still - I never did find my Corpse in <br/>
the Southern Desert of Ro!   Starting a new throw away character <br/>
in other places is a great opportunity to explore both class/race <br/>
abilities and other locations with fewer risks to my primary.<br/>
<br/>
What DOES bother me is the absence of a GM on TEST where <br/>
problems are expected to pop up.  I have Bugged a few already<br/>
I found in the Temple Marr during my first Message Quest.<br/>
Okay, maybe not a 1am on Saturday morning, but then, when <br/>
does any hardcore EQ player really sleep?  <br/>
If John were listening &lt;g&gt;, then I would simply expect one 24x7, <br/>
over any of the other servers, as a requirement for EQ&#39;s own <br/>
healthiness.<br/>
<br/>
Dark Elf Shadow Knight is a difficult combination.  The game<br/>
warns this during character registration on the server.  <br/>
Actually a nice warning for some who have never played <br/>
AD&D or RPg&#39;d.   I love to see the Doom/Quake Fraggers <br/>
flaunder about with less than a trusty pistol to start.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   From: &quot;Shane Bole&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:shane0009@...">shane0009@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; go to the nekbulos forest or whatever its called <br/>
&gt; you should find stuff there to kill<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shane, I&#39;ll try Nekbulos next time on, Neriak is a strange place indeed.<br/>
Other than for Necro&#39;s and SK&#39;s, I didn&#39;t see a mailng list for it, so <br/>
I created one.   <br/>
My question, are the Ghoul critters fodder or friend for Dark Elf types?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; crowded with people stealing kills<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Amen... For even a loner, as I am, it&#39;s a bit two quiet at times.  <br/>
It is nice to see another face other than a guard or merchant<br/>
in Freeport during the early AM.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thormael<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Another point is that they reset server and boot people without <br/>
&gt; warning usually, and I didn&#39;t pay for this as a permanent effect!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t pay for my frequent freezing on &#39;live&#39; either.  <br/>
I signed on the Friday after EQ went out of Beta.  <br/>
The same weekend as the UUNet router problems which <br/>
affected everyone!   That was also beyond Verant&#39;s control.<br/>
<br/>
Verant and EverQuest are going through normal post-beta growing pains.  <br/>
I had the same experience working with Microprose with the release of<br/>
Magic the Gathering.  This before being absorbed into the Hasbro Borg.  <br/>
Simtronics opened Hercules & Xena and continued to tweak well beyond<br/>
Beta.  More than once my items wouldn&#39;t BUNDLE correctly afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
I will continue to be very patient.  <br/>
<br/>
I see potential in this great game.  Even the non in-game social aspect <br/>
like this message, adds to &quot;our&quot; whole experience of playing.  <br/>
Just try a Search on Onelist for Everquest!<br/>
I just wish there would be far less duplicates of similar lists <br/>
and an &quot;official&quot; NETRep appearance in each of them.   <br/>
Okay, so it would be a really boring job having to READ a bunch of group <br/>
email rants ALL day long,  but it could also reward the faithful subscribers <br/>
that Verrant is present and listening.   <br/>
What else is there to do 9-5 during the week?  &lt;even bigger Grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today, my problem(s) feels like it&#39;s due to just MY configuration.  Techy <br/>
stuff.<br/>
I&#39;ve already created a second Win98 boot profile to disable things like USB<br/>
and Network.   Btw: it doesn&#39;t seem to have helped.    Since John&#39;s message<br/>
I even tried disabling my sound card, but that seems to make EQ launch<br/>
problems only worse.  On BUGS, I have a handful of confirms that others also <br/>
had similar problems.    I have forwarded to Phase2 (Steve) per EQVault news, <br/>
my Nevat.zip file I previously sent to EQtech.  I do hope they remember to <br/>
READ the included ZIP comments.  <br/>
I have not seen ANY reply or a courtesy confirmation like a auto-ack Ticket#.<br/>
My other problem, about the same time as freezing started, lovely mosaic <br/>
screens are in the game on both Veeshan and Test.  I&#39;ve sent a few of them <br/>
to EQShots for Screen shots of the day.  My favorite is Freeport Winter.<br/>
If anyone is interested, I can post my NEVAT.Zip in the Files section here.<br/>
