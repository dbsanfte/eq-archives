<b>Subject:</b> Where to go from here? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-272287208">So I&#39;ve actually been reading this forum for quite a while, but <br/>
never had reason to post. I got started playin EQ a few months ago, <br/>
on a friend&#39;s account, and got my bard to lvl 34 before he pretty <br/>
much wouldn&#39;t let me play anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;ve got my own account, and my main is a lvl 31 cleric. Getting <br/>
there was pretty easy, I just did everything I&#39;d already done <br/>
before. One of my RL friends helps me whenever he&#39;s on, but we can&#39;t <br/>
always be on at the same time, and he&#39;s usually busy off on some <br/>
raid with his guild. Plus I&#39;m getting tired of bugging him all the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
So where do I go from here? Where are the best places for xp? Are <br/>
there any quests or anything that I should be doing, and what? I <br/>
would very much appreciate any suggestions.<br/>
