<div id="ygrps-yiv-837452711">Enjoy each level. Take your time leveling and enjoy each new zone you <br/>
discover. Find your own playing style and work with that in mind. Get <br/>
to know the many help sites so that you can learn about items, <br/>
quests, and interesting places to visit. Try the trade skills, see if <br/>
you enjoy that part of the game. Be polite. Help people. Have fun.<br/>
<br/>
I have printed a map book I use when exploring. Keep the maps in a <br/>
binder I can lay before me when I play. I included zone connection <br/>
maps and a level chart. Information is important in this game.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun.<br/>
