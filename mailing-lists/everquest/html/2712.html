  I just hit level 30 last night, and being the Druid that I am, I had a<br>&gt; 
  couple of questions.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; First, I&#39;ve been hunting in South Karana 
  since level 25, hunting the Tesch<br>&gt; Mas Gnolls around Paw, and perhaps 
  have become a little spoiled, as I have<br>&gt; been getting great experience 
  killing the yellows and whites, and reaping<br>&gt; the rewards of the loot. 
  Now, having reached level 30, all of the gnolls<br>are<br>&gt; now nearing the 
  point where hunting them isn&#39;t beneficial. Could someone<br>&gt; suggest a 
  similar zone/area with good experience and average to good loot<br>&gt; where 
  I could hunt fairly safely, either in a group or solo?<br><br>You can try 
  going inside Paw (I was actually hunting in Paw from 25 to about<br>30, 
  altough you can hunt in Paw longer than that).<br><br>After that, I went to RM 
  to hunt HGs and spent some time in Crystal Caverns.<br>I basically did 30-40 
  in RM, CC, OT and Eastern Wastes (with a couple<br>unsuccessful trips to Tower 
  of the Frozen Shadow).<br><br>I would make sure that you get as much 
  experience dungeons as you can<br>though.&nbsp; LGuk and SolB (along with CC) 
  are good places to try to find a<br>group.&nbsp; I did some hunting in SolA at 
  30, but you really need to go deep to<br>get good XP 
  there.<br><br>Sulamwen<br>Half Elf Pathfinder<br>E&#39;ci<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
