&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you like to raid a lot and are playing in large groups, remember<br/>
&gt; serverfilter is your friend and DONT forget to set your datarate.txt to<br/>
&gt; appropriate value. Your friends will love it even more than you not having<br/>
&gt; to wait for ld people all the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I think you have some learning to do before this, keep it up.<br/>
&gt; Experiment, learn. dont just take it from everyone else.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;   I am really impressed with the game!!!! I love how everyone is so<br/>
&gt; help full and willing to give money and items. It has real help me. I<br/>
&gt; want to know somethings though, How do you yell a message? How do you<br/>
&gt; Speak yout of person? how do you Add to ones friends list? And, How<br/>
&gt; do you learn things like sence heading? I have alot of other<br/>
&gt; questions. I am hoping that I am not going to make anyone mad.<br/>
