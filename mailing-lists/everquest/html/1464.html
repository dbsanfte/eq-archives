<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052374903"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">ROFLMBO!!!! &nbsp;I don&#39;t go around inspecting anyone. &nbsp;This level 6 inspected me 
<br>and then told me to inspect him. &nbsp;I don&#39;t pay attention to others. &nbsp;I guess 
<br>this person wanted to show me what his rich uncle gave him. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know any 
<br>16 year olds driving a BMW. &nbsp;I live in the country. &nbsp;You don&#39;t see many BMWs 
<br>out here. &nbsp;I&#39;m not in for a sad EQ life. &nbsp;I enjoy it very much thank you. &nbsp;
<br>I&#39;m not in it for an uber character. &nbsp;I play to have fun. &nbsp;I am not 
<br>anti-twinkage. &nbsp;My husband has a couple high characters on another account. &nbsp;
<br>So I could twink my enchanter out outrageously. &nbsp;I choose to do it wisely.

<br>of people with great gear better than yours. I guess you&#39;re in for a sad EQ
<br>life, or atleast until you understand this and get over your sadness or you
<br>obtain some great gear for yourself. 
<br>
<br>Buy low, sell high and go buy your own uber gear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial">
