<div id="ygrps-yiv-952854695">Nah, if you wanted your first name changed, I&#39;m sure<br/>
you&#39;d have to pony up the 50 bucks for it. <br/>
<br/>
The only free first names changes that I know of are,<br/>
again, due to naming violations. My husbands necro got<br/>
away with being called Saatan for quite a while until<br/>
he had to petition about some other problem. When the<br/>
GM contacted him about his problem, before the<br/>
conversation was over he said &quot;And about that name...&quot;<br/>
hehe. GM at least allowed him to pick a new first<br/>
name. :)<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t think a petition for a first name change<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; work, so I&#39;ve never tried.  I grabbed that name<br/>
&gt; pre-Kunark and I&#39;ll bet most 4 letter names are gone<br/>
&gt; at this point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh well... Quwi was a good shot at it phonetically<br/>
