<b>Subject:</b> Lag at the Bazaar <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-597027891">Hi everyone,<br/>
	Well I&#39;m probably going to get flamed for this but you all do<br/>
realize that the bazaar is a new feature and it&#39;s going to get hammered<br/>
by practically all the players in the first couple of weeks? If any<br/>
Verant admins monitor this list maybe they could post the stats on how<br/>
many hits the servers for the bazaar are getting and their processing<br/>
percentage plus the net traffic stats. I bet that they will all<br/>
practically be maxed out. Basically what I&#39;m saying is, yes the lag is<br/>
annoying but be patient and give it time and it will quickly even itself<br/>
out. The problem is not your computer, it&#39;s a combination of your<br/>
connection to the net and how many are also on at your local hub at the<br/>
same time you are, (if you have a broadband connection), and that the<br/>
servers are taking a hellacious beating right now. The bank in Kelethin<br/>
is this way, it lags when everyone is meeting there but when everyone is<br/>
out hackin and slashin it&#39;s really smooth. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
