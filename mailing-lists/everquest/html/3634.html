&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A Necro isn&#39;t a Hybrid, its a pure Int caster just like a Mage, a Wizard or<br/>
an Enchanter. Yes, the necro was killing quicker than you, but he can&#39;t Port<br/>
or heal others as effectively, which is supposed to balance effective class<br/>
&#39;power&#39;. Necro&#39;s are probably the best soloers, with druids close behind.<br/>
