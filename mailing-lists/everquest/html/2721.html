<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Actually as I write in another post, the Geforce 2 
MX and 4 MX do not support Direct X 8.1. The Geforce 3 and 4 Ti series do. I 
noticed a definate difference between the appearance of my enchanter friend&#39;s 
air elemental illusion with the Geforce 4 Ti and the Geforce 4 MX. With the Ti 
he looked incredible, with the MX he looked mediocre at best. It is such a major 
difference that I cannot play the game anymore without a Geforce 4 Ti. I&nbsp;am 
so distraught that I have to go to bed now so I can take this crap card back to 
the store and get a real graphics card. &nbsp;</font></div>

  The 4 MX seems to basically be a 2 MX, just <br>&gt; faster and more memory. I 
  may take back my MX and get the Ti, the day <br>&gt; that I spent with that 
  card was the most enjoyable day I ever spent in EQ.<br><br><br>IMHO anything 
  better than a geforce2, doesn&#39;t make things look better<br>playing EQ, just 
  much faster, or even make it playable.<br><br>i think there aren&#39;t any special 
  routines that really take advantage<br>or even use the &quot;special&quot; features of 
  the &quot;big&quot; geforce cards.<br><br><br>but i am happy that i switched to a 
  &quot;geforce 3 ti 500&quot; now, because i<br><br>used a &quot;geforce 2&quot; (one of the first 
  cards on the market, so it is<br>really old :) and there were some luclin 
  zones, i almost couldn&#39;t play<br>at all. well, i could move in that zones, but 
  after switching almost<br>everything off ... and i didn&#39;t like the look of 
  it.<br><br>what i really hate, is to have the clip-plane at it&#39;s minimum. in 
  some<br>zones you think it is night all the time. or you can&#39;t even find 
  your<br>way around. just try this: go to katta bank, stand on the steps 
  there<br>and face the stairs. then play around with the clip plane 
  settings!<br><br><br>currently i play another online game again: Asheron&#39;s 
  Call. what i<br>really love about their game engine, even if it doesn&#39;t look 
  this<br>good like EQ (i am talking about AC1, NOT AC2), it runs very 
  fast<br>even on my P2/300 with a TNT2 card at 1024x768.<br><br>i played 
  &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; and was in the beta of &quot;Neocron&quot;: the gfx<br>is very good - 
  sometimes i prefer AO&#39;s to EQ&#39;s ! - and they don&#39;t<br>eat up all of your 
  ressources. IMHO the verant people can do and they<br>should really start to 
  work on building up a better gfx engine.<br>i mean it is just crazy to demand 
  from the users to use P4s and<br>geforce 4 cards, when others can do superb 
  gfx with P2/P3 based<br>systems and a TNT2 or geforce 2.<br><br><br>have
