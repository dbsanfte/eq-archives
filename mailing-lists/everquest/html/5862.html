<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219524471">Hmm.. I think in that case you have to see who can keep aggro better and who is easiest to keep maintained. You don&#39;t want a tank that drains the cleric&#39;s mana too much. Plus you want someone who can keep constant aggro.<br/>

I&#39;ve got a question for you all..say your the group leader and you have 2<br/>
tanks.  You compare them to see who is going to be the Main Tank and one<br/>
tank has more hit points than the other, but the other has more AC.  Who do<br/>
you choose to be the Main Tank, the guy with more hit points, or AC?<br/>
