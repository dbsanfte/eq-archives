&gt; I use the root and nuke strategy.<br/>
&gt; Another fun thing to do for faction or items.<br/>
&gt; With my cleric I run around hittng polar bear cubs once and get a whole<br/>
&gt; train of them on me (when I am much higher lvl than them). Once I have<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; 5 or more I wait til they are all close to me and cast Word of Pain. Then<br/>
&gt; They all die instantly. So then I gather up their pelts. some of which can<br/>
&gt; be turned in for quests.<br/>
&gt; I do something similar with my wizard and orc pawns in Freeport. I use a<br/>
&gt; low<br/>
&gt; lvl dd spell to lure pawns to me and get a whole bunch around me. This is<br/>
&gt; good when I am encumbered and cannot chase after them. Once I get them<br/>
&gt; gathered around I use an AE spell. if they don&#39;t all die, I stand in place<br/>
&gt; and attack the ones that are close to me. If they run I turn to another<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; and fight it. Eventulaly they all come back to me. I keep fighting til<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; are all laying dead around me. then I loot their corpses and gate back to<br/>
&gt; Hallard&#39;s to deliver pawn picks.<br/>
&gt; Got my faction up to apprehensive so far.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
