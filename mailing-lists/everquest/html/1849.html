<div id="ygrps-yiv-705680070">I had spent the whole day camping Karnors waiting for Venril Sathir to<br/>
spawn, to kill him for the staff for the Wizard epic, At 10pm I gave up.<br/>
Half hour later I get a phonecall from a fellow wizard in our guild saying<br/>
he had just spawned.<br/>
Nearly the whole guild turned out to kill him.<br/>
When he did actually drop the staff, I was about to give the guy in question<br/>
a tell saying lets roll for it, he shouted to the zone congratulations for<br/>
me.<br/>
I was speechless.<br/>

<br/>
What is the nicest thing someone has done for you in game?<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has been showing me the ropes of EQ and, when I get<br/>
high enough, I want to repay him for his kindness.  Looking for ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all.<br/>
