You offer good advice, but I have to add a warning about the Frontier<br/>
Mountains zone. You mentioned having Camouflage memmed, which, while a good<br/>
idea while travelling in any dangerous zone, can lull you into a false sense<br/>
of security in FM (Dreadlands too). I say that because the Mountain Giants<br/>
are not fooled by Camo, or Invis -- they see right through it, and would not<br/>
be a good chance meeting for a level 29 druid travelling alone. I think some<br/>
of the Goblin Casters and perhaps the Burynai Cenobites can also see through<br/>
Camo/Invis.<br/>
