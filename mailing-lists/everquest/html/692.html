<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384585761">I have a Ranger, and I started really having the most fun around level<br/>
2, but the peak so far has been 39 for me, because I can do so much more<br/>
and help so many more people.  I have very good spells and very good<br/>
armor / weapons, and can help so many people that I have a ton more<br/>
fun.  Also, I think that a guild is a huge part of the game and without<br/>
a GOOD one, many will drop out of the game around level 25 to 30...<br/>
