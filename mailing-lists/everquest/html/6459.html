<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Does anyone solo anymore? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-323290073">I prefer to solo, unfortunately its not possible with<br/>
my connection. At level 66 I still have trouble<br/>
killing level 30s. Mostly because of the damage<br/>
misreporting related to the lag. Although I haven&#39;t<br/>
played in months. My connection has gotten so bad that<br/>
I really can&#39;t play anymore. I tried doing an LDON a<br/>
few months ago but the lag got so bad that I was stuck<br/>
for 15 minutes unable to do anything. Zoning takes at<br/>
least 5 minutes. If I die it will take me 20 minutes<br/>
at the very least to get back to my corpse. Sometimes<br/>
an hour if I have to zone a lot.<br/>
I really don&#39;t think the game is designed for<br/>
characters of my class and level to be able to solo. <br/>
I&#39;ve pretty much switched to World of Warcraft now<br/>
because it doesn&#39;t do damage misreporting and death<br/>
doesn&#39;t take too much time.<br/>
luv,<br/>
