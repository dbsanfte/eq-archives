The Lost Dungeons of Norrath introduces an exciting new type of treasure to<br/>
EverQuest. Using new modular items gained from dungeon adventures,<br/>
characters are able to modify the powers and effects of their equipment,<br/>
allowing for a tremendous amount of customization.<br/>
<br/>
Using these new items, characters can augment an existing breastplate, for<br/>
example. Bonding the proper augmentation item to the breastplate might give<br/>
it +5 strength. Bonding a different augmentation item could give it +6<br/>
wisdom. These are just a few simple examples; the new items have a wide<br/>
variety of possible effects and benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Have a helmet that you like, but think needs a little boost? This new item<br/>
system allows you to customize that helmet and make it fit your character&#39;s<br/>
needs better. Most characters have a favorite item that they&#39;ve had in their<br/>
bank for a while. They don&#39;t want to destroy it because it holds some<br/>
memories, a link to the adventures they had gaining it. With this new item<br/>
augmentation system, those items gain new life and endless potential!<br/>

I think this will be pretty cool. I have some items that I like that I would<br/>
love to augment. I guess it means the new items you find will allow you to<br/>
augment current armor. Someone likened it to the way gems affect items in<br/>
Diablo II. At the live chat they said that the augmentations can be undone<br/>
but that then they would be lost or something. And they said certain types<br/>
of armor can only take certain types of mods. Any comments or thoughts?<br/>
