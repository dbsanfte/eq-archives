<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011757094">I have 512MB of memory and the same thrashing<br/>
performance from the disk on zoning.  I already knew I<br/>
needed more video memory but it was excellent to see<br/>
the various explanations on this board (good job tech<br/>
heads and thanks for the info). <br/>
<br/>
My problem is that I have to use a laptop to play EQ<br/>
(I travel for a living) and I can&#39;t upgrade my video<br/>
card... ATI Rage with 8MB of memory.  <br/>
<br/>
I can run in any zone without trees, but if there are<br/>
trees forget about it.  Why Sony put all those damn<br/>
little leafs in that have to be rendered on object in<br/>
the landscape is beyond me.  Sometimes when I&#39;m<br/>
thrashing trying to get by a bunch of trees I&#39;ll go<br/>
ahead and put my toon on autorun (autocrawl actually)<br/>
and I make a bug report asking why Sony had to be so<br/>
stupid with landscape features that don&#39;t matter. <br/>
Make the leafs one solid green circle and the game<br/>
would be 100x better for us low video memory players. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sure, render mobs, render players, render the sky...<br/>
all that&#39;s cool since that stuff matters to game play,<br/>
but when the trees bog me down it makes me mad because<br/>
they don&#39;t matter at all.<br/>

&gt; your system&#39;s motherboard can support.  If you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; running a PII, there is a possibility you might not<br/>
&gt; be able to use a 4X AGP card.  The max it may<br/>
&gt; support is 2X.  If that is the case you&#39;ll have to<br/>
&gt; go with the card that will fit your form factor<br/>
&gt; regardless of which one it is.   You might even want<br/>
&gt; to open the case to make sure you actually HAVe an<br/>
&gt; AGP slot and that the graphics aren&#39;t built into the<br/>
&gt; board.  It would suck to buy a card for $200 only to<br/>
&gt; find out you can&#39;t install it.    But all that<br/>
&gt; aside, assuming you can use it and either will fit,<br/>
&gt; then I&#39;d say yes, go with more memory.  I use an ATI<br/>
&gt; Radeon 9000 128MB 4X AGP.  I&#39;ve had excellent<br/>
&gt; performance with it.  But the choice is yours. <br/>
&gt; Either way, you&#39;ll still get better results.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thanks very much indeed for that excellent<br/>
&gt; explanation!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   From what you say then, I would be better off with<br/>
&gt; a 128Mb ATI Radeon <br/>
&gt;   based card than a 64MB nVidia for my money?<br/>
