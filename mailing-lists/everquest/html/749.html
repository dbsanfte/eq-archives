<b>Subject:</b> Q: Odd situation...? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-790097296">My husband and I play EQ on a networked setup.  We created our<br/>
characters at the same time, we&#39;re both Wood Elf Druids.  We<br/>
distributed our extra 30 stat points the same.  We group most of the<br/>
time so level just about the same time.  We even have the same AC and<br/>
HP within a couple of points.  We&#39;ve been keeping track of our<br/>
numerical stats/skills and he&#39;s actually a bit *better* than I am in<br/>
most abilities, including 1H blunt and most spell casting.  However -<br/>
he gets the snot beat out of him all the time.  He &quot;misses&quot; a *LOT*,<br/>
even when I&#39;m fighting something and he&#39;s come up behind it.  When he<br/>
does hit he hits for 6 and 7 points avg, where I avg. 10 or 11...  The<br/>
only *real* difference between his character and mine is the<br/>
gender..... Any ideas *what* the deal is?  Oh, other things we&#39;ve<br/>
checked:  Weight allowance - carrying minimal amount.  Carrying<br/>
something detrimental - nothing that I can see.<br/>
<br/>
Very confused, <br/>
