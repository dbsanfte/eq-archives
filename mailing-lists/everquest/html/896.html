&gt; OK, so I&#39;m wondering how I view the details of an Iteam... I see <br/>
&gt;iteam details on web pages all the time. I would like to be able to <br/>
&gt;get this in the game so the next time I see a Ring Cloak I won&#39;t buy <br/>
&gt;it thinking I can wear it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All you have to do is right click on the item, but *hold down* the right<br/>
mouse button. That will bring up the stats screen on the item. You have to<br/>
do this in a trade window, though, not while someone else is wearing it. If<br/>
you right click/hold on an item someone else is wearing it will just<br/>
display the name of the item. Right click/hold also works if an item is in<br/>
YOUR inventory, or if the item is being offered by a merchant.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
