I too enjoy the fact that when exploring a new area with the armor I have<br/>
worked so hard to get just might be lost just around the next bend.<br/>

&gt; I am rather new to the game, but one of the things that fascinates me <br/>
&gt; is the real sense of danger when I put my character in a new <br/>
&gt; situation. Heart pounds, pulse rate goes up, I even get the shakes <br/>
&gt; sometimes. I seldom get that in real life, even though I have a job <br/>
&gt; that requires occasional physical combat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love this game!<br/>

&gt; &gt; As far as I know, there&#39;s only the port to the Dreadlands.  I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; never been <br/>
&gt; &gt; there.  My husband went the other night and was scared to death.  <br/>
&gt; He just <br/>
&gt; &gt; took off running and made it safely but how I don&#39;t know.  Just <br/>
&gt; dumb luck.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; He&#39;s a 30 mage now, was 28 then and everything he passed was <br/>
&gt; conning red to <br/>
&gt; &gt; him.  He said he will stick to the boats for a while.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of porting...how can I get a port to Kunark?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not Dreadlands...but closer to Cabilis<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and without taking the barrel barge?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is there anywhere else that will get me into Kunark besides one <br/>
&gt; of the boats<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or the DL port...please<br/>
