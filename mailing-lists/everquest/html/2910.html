<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078696128">One of the best boosts in brewing as a druid has been vegetable oil. <br/>
One foraged vegetables, one water. Lots of failures, as this is <br/>
fairly high level. Little hassle, though. I just save any veggies I <br/>
forage, and when I have a stack I stop by a brew barrel. Quite a bit <br/>
of experience for the effort.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know what the oil is for. Been saving it until I know.<br/>
