<div id="ygrps-yiv-819958713">Hehe, I don&#39;t know the answer to your question about the ore, but I had to<br/>
respond:<br/>
<br/>
I am so happy to find out that I am not the only Druid that hates dungeons.<br/>
Give me the wide open spaces of the Karanas, the Overthere, the Dreadlands,<br/>
or even Rathe Mts. any day. Seems like every time I venture into, say,<br/>
Runnyeye, Sol A, Sol B, or Lower Guk, I get killed. In fact I just got<br/>
de-leveled back into hell 40 this past weekend because of some nasty<br/>
Pickclaw Casters in the bottom level of Runnyeye. They didn&#39;t like the fact<br/>
that I was healing a level 24 warrior that wanted some Blackened Alloy, and<br/>
I was too proud to desert him to his death to save my own skin.<br/>

&gt; I took the advice of others here and having finished my goals in EK I<br/>
&gt; moved to SK. I have found the gnolls camped heavily, but while there<br/>
&gt; have found Aviak Rooks wandering with sufficient frequency to be<br/>
&gt; profitable. I solo them, getting about 1.5pp average in cash and<br/>
&gt; loot. Not too bad, and I can pick off something else when they are<br/>
&gt; too thin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone know if the hq ore dropped in Runnyeye is no drop? My druid<br/>
&gt; does not do that well in dungeons, so hunting up the stuff myself is<br/>
&gt; not a happy prospect.<br/>
