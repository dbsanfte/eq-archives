<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-809763924">A friend just passed this info along and I felt strongly enough about it to<br/>
pass it along to everyone because I detest anything that crashes computers<br/>
and wanted to make everyone aware of this new stupidity.<br/>

Basically, the &quot;CD&quot;s listed will not only not play, but they can crash your<br/>
computer and cause damage. I understand that record companies don&#39;t want<br/>
songs being ripped, but the only CD player I use is in my computer. Some<br/>
companies just amaze me with their stupidity. Their form of copy protection<br/>
is just not the way to go.<br/>
At least Philips is taking the more consumer friendly approach.<br/>
