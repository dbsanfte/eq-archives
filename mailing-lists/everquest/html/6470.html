<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052221077">LOL Im sorry about all your issues Su..but I have one question for you..<br><br>Have you considered moving? lol<br><br>(Forgive me, Im not making light of your situation, I just find it a little funny to hear about your issues.)&nbsp; See I fried my desktop, and with money a bit short these days, I am set to play EQ on a laptop, that wont quite handle it well.<br><br>It takes 10 minutes to log in, if it does. If it does then there is no guarantee that I will stay and if I do, how long I will stay in. If I&#39;m in, I lagg so badly it sucks. I can run halfway across a zone and not realize I was lagging the whole time, so when it unlaggs im back where i started from. I can aatack something, and by the time I unlagg its dead. IIm afraid to hunt with my 61 bst right now because of it. <br><br>I hunted at the OC in POV the other night, and i lagged so baadly as i was chasing down the kill, i ended up halway across the zone, but that was because of a stuck button......and not being
 familiar too familiar with the zone, i nearly trained everyone<br><br>So needless to say, Most of my toons are maaxing their tradeskills and all skills in general just by hanging out in POK. So I shouldnt complain really, at least I can get in and hear thatt wonderful irish pub song as i run by the &quot;still&quot; in PoK...lol<br><br>As always<br><br>Greg<br><br><b><i>Su Johnston &lt;suceress@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1052221077replbq" style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;">    I looked into Norton Ghost and it had really bad<br> reviews on downloads.com. One of the reviewers<br> mentioned a less expensive program (with better<br> reviews) called Acronis True Image. I think I will<br> look into the abilities of the Acronis one to see if<br> it would work for what I want to do. If not I may see<br> about going with Norton Ghost 10.0. I really really<br> appreciate the info!<br> I just need to remember to burn something to
 DVD to<br> help restore windows XP in case there is a problem<br> when I upgrade to the new mainboard setup.<br> Direcway just sold out to Hughes.net and the service<br> has really declined. I keep having pages timeout when<br> loading and get errors, their tech support no longer<br> works (can&#39;t get through to anyone), and my pop3 email<br> no longer works (despite my following their tutorials<br> on setting it up). So I had to switch to using yahoo<br> email. bleh. I think its evident I&#39;m more than a teeny<br> bit annoyed. <br> The bandwidth cap is a major pain. When I first signed<br> up they said that unless I was constantly loading<br> really large files at a high rate of speed I wouldn&#39;t<br> have to worry about the cap. That was before they<br> lowered the amount of bandwidth allowed before<br> capping. Loading a patch for EQ takes about 4 hours or<br> more. Its really annoying. I lose connection whenever<br> it rains-- or sometimes when its bright and sunny for<br>
 no apparent reason. I would not recommend this<br> &quot;service&quot; to anyone. I had to call tech support sooo<br> many times that I memorized some of the routines and<br> then one of the techs in India started flirting with<br> me (which was actually pretty funny).<br> Man.. I&#39;m venting..<br> Once I get the system upgraded I will see about<br> playing again.<br> Thank you!<br> *hugs*<br> luv,<br> -Su<br> This didn&#39;t go the first time I tried to send.

 Norton&#39;s Ghost on your main drive.&nbsp; Run<br> &gt; Norton&#39;s Ghost and choose the option to do a direct<br> &gt; ghost copy to the new drive.&nbsp; Everything right down<br> &gt; to the partitions will be copied to the new drive. <br> &gt; Then you shut down the machine, switch the drive<br> &gt; over to master and reboot.&nbsp; Barring any major<br> &gt; problems it&#39;ll boot up exactly as if it were the<br> &gt; regular drive on that system.&nbsp; Then you can take the<br> &gt; original drive and wipe it and use it as a secondary<br> &gt; for extra space.&nbsp; It&#39;s a handy program.<br> &gt; <br> &gt; Your system sounds decent enough to run EQ albeit<br> &gt; with some lag in the newer zones.&nbsp; Turning off a lot<br> &gt; of options might help that though.&nbsp; However, on<br> &gt; DirecWay I wouldn&#39;t expect too much.&nbsp; DirecWay is<br> &gt; bad about limiting the amount of data that can be<br> &gt; sent at any given time.&nbsp; If you send mroe than you<br> &gt;
 are allowed to, they pretty much stop all<br> &gt; communication and give you some stupid message about<br> &gt; exceedxing the bandwidth.&nbsp; Then it takes like 5<br> &gt; minutes to reset.&nbsp; You can look it up, the info is<br> &gt; right there ont he DirecWay site.&nbsp; That&#39;s why they<br> &gt; don&#39;t reccomend using DirecWay for gaming.&nbsp; But if<br> &gt; all you want to do is browse the web and chat, it&#39;s<br> &gt; fine.&nbsp; If I can find the link, I&#39;ll post it for you.<br> &gt; <br> &gt; Wulfric<br> &gt; <br> &gt; <br> &gt; <br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; ----- Original Message ----- <br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; From: Su Johnston <br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com <br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sent: Sunday, April 23, 2006 6:42 AM<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Does anyone solo anymore?<br> &gt; <br> &gt; <br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a Cleric. But I haven&#39;t actually gotten xp<br> &gt; in<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; over a year. I can&#39;t even get dialup where I
 live<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; because the phone company has spliced my lines so<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; badly I can&#39;t even dial out to an ISP. They refuse<br> &gt; to<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; fix it and so far I haven&#39;t found any way to get<br> &gt; them<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to. Too much other stuff to worry about frankly.<br> &gt; Like<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; finding a lawyer to sue a doctor for malpractice,<br> &gt; and<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; still working on repairing hurricane Rita damage.<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I currently have direcway Satellite-- which<br> &gt; inherently<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; has latency. When I first got it with the Direcway<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4000 2-way the bandwidth was 800k down and about<br> &gt; 50k<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; up (allegedly 50k up-- clocked around 30k).<br> &gt; Sometime<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; later when the modem died due to an incident with<br> &gt; my<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; cat and a glass of milk I got the newer Direcway<br> &gt; 6000.<br>
 &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direcway then dropped the bandwidth to 500k down<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; (without informing me). When I play world of<br> &gt; warcraft<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I generally have between 1200 to 4000ms latency.<br> &gt; Last<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; time I tried to get into EQ it just kept timing<br> &gt; out on<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; me.<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for my system, I have an AMD athlon thunderbird<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.4Ghz processor, 1GB of DDR SDRAM, ASUS A7M266-M<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; motherboard, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128Mb vid card, and<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card.<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I plan on upgrading to an ASUS A8V Deluxe (rev 2)<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; motherboard, 2Gb Kingston PC3200 ValueRAM, and AMD<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athlon 3500 2.0GHz processor (with venice core).<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be using my same video card, sound card,<br> &gt; and<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; power supply (Antec SmartPower 2.0 450W) and<br> &gt;
 adding an<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional 300Gb harddrive.<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m currently trying to figure out how to transfer<br> &gt; all<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; of my data from my puny primary drive and putting<br> &gt; it<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the 300Gb drive and setting it as primary, then<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; upgrading to the new mobo setup without having to<br> &gt; use<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; a windows xp cd. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have<br> &gt; restore<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; CDs for my pc bc it didn&#39;t come with any software<br> &gt; on<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; CDs. One of those deals where HP partitioned the<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; harddrive. Since the warrenty is up on it I doubt<br> &gt; I<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; could get tech support from them.<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I could figure out a way to just copy all<br> &gt; of<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; the programs so that they would be installable. I<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; should have an extra OEM of xp laying around<br> &gt;
