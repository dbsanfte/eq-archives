<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a minor &quot;correction&quot;: the changes start at 46, when it is possible to enter<br/>
the<br/>
&quot;old&quot; planes... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
actually i don&#39;t know if the new planes are level restricted, because i<br/>
never<br/>
tried to access one with my smaller alts.<br/>
<br/>
but back to the old planes, i just think of fear: when you move to the first<br/>
&quot;camp spot&quot; there is almost no chance to sit down for quite some time...<br/>
<br/>
another place where i hunted with bilt for quite some time: jagged pine.<br/>
i camped the dyrads with many roamers around. you really get less<br/>
aggro mounted than sitting. but my faction is now so bad with the JP<br/>
residents, it doesn&#39;t really matter anymore... *g*<br/>
