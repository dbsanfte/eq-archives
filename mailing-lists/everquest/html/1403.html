<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143656077">But I wasn&#39;t in attack mode.It never said anything about me attacking. Also,<br/>
I wasn&#39;t in the right screen to have my attack hotkey on. Furthermore, my<br/>
hands were off the keyboard...<br/>
But the npc acted like I attacked when I didn&#39;t.. That&#39;s why it puzzles me<br/>
so much.<br/>
Oh well, at least I got my lvl back after 3 days of killing stuff.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; made sure to con everyone. Nobody was KOS. Most were apprehensive to<br/>
&gt; indifferent. I went to buy from a merchant. As soon as I finished the<br/>
&gt; transaction something started hitting me. I turned around and couldnt&#39; see<br/>
&gt; it anywhere. I ran from the building and soon I was dead. Even looking<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at my corpse, whatever attacked me was not visible. I scrolled back up to<br/>
&gt; see what I had done to piss it off. All the thing said before attacking me<br/>
&gt; was &quot;How dare you!&quot;  It didn&#39;t say anything about me being a dark elf or<br/>
&gt; whatnot. I petitioned and the GM said that it probably attacked me thru<br/>

&gt; never did. :-(<br/>
&gt; The worst part was, I lost my level.. and I still haven&#39;t gotten back<br/>
 </span></blockquote>after<br/>
