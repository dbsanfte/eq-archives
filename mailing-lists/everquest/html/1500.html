<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428432392">You may want to look into Defragmenting the hard<br/>
drive.  Under Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools.<br/>
 Sometimes the problems you describe occur when the<br/>
zone files have become fragmented.  Also, you might<br/>
want to see about increasing her memory (RAM). <br/>
Windows 98 needs atleast 64megs to work properly.. EQ<br/>
really requires at least 128..  256 even better. <br/>
Memory these days is pretty cheap.<br/>
