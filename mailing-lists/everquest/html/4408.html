<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It&#39;s good fortune like this that really makes the 
game worth playing.&nbsp; Situations like these have happened to me as 
well.&nbsp; They are few and far between but they do happen.&nbsp; And I believe 
the game is cyclical in nature.&nbsp; That you are more likely to help other 
people out if there have been those to help you along the way.&nbsp; I know 
oftentimes when I have nothing better to do I will randomly target a player 
between lvls 1-10 and power level them for awhile with my 47 druid.&nbsp; This 
usually includes buying or giving them armor or gear&nbsp;better than what they 
have.&nbsp; The lower levels are really difficult to get through when you don&#39;t 
have money.&nbsp; I know.. I&#39;ve been there.&nbsp; I&#39;m still there with some 
characters.&nbsp; But if it weren&#39;t for my guild, people helping me out, or my 
established characters, I&#39;d probably still be poor and using leather 
armor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as what&#39;s good prices for things, it all comes 
down to what you feel like is fair to pay.&nbsp; If you think you can afford it, 
go ahead and buy it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can do an item search in the Bazaar and see 
what other vendors are selling it for.&nbsp; If they all have about the same 
prices, then go for what&#39;s available.</font></div>

  People/Intelligence Boosters?</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>I had been playing EQ for about a week, and a Dark Elf lady 
  walked up <br>behind me, gave me some buffs, and gave me a Smoldering Brand. I 
  <br>asked what it was and she said &quot;You can use it, or sell it and get 
  <br>good money&quot;. I thanked the lady to death! Later when I went to the 
  <br>bank to put the brand in there, I also noticed that she had given me 
  <br>600PP! Another Dark Elf asked me if I&#39;d go into the Herb Jar in S. 
  <br>Qeynos and buy a spell for her. When I did, she gave me a Runed 
  <br>Circlet. A Warrior asked me to do the same thing, and he gave me <br>buffs 
  and 5PP. I have been pretty lucky in that aspect.<br><br>With the money, I 
  have been trying to buy items to boost my <br>intelligence, and I&#39;ve been 
  trying to buy things to help my sister, a <br>Level 10 Mage out too. Can 
  anyone give me suggestion on what to buy? <br>Last night I ran across a 
  Karana&#39;s Tear Earring for 91PP and a Polar <br>Bear Robe for 6GP for myself; 
  and a Magi&#39;??? Earring for 50PP for my <br>sister. Where these good prices for 
  these items? And what else do <br>y&#39;all suggest might help me gain 
  intelligence?<br><br>Thanks a bunch<br>Dawn (Enie)<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
