<b>Subject:</b> Hello <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-70497103">I have recently (taday actually) renewed my EQ fascination <br/>
(addiction?). In my previous EQ days ( I quit right after PoP came <br/>
out) I played strictly melee characters....had a 57th lvl Barb <br/>
Warrior, and a 59th lvl Hum Monk. I got tired of the endless <br/>
searching for groups, and the seeming HUGE overload of really well <br/>
equipped melees on my server (Tunare) so this time around I decided <br/>
to go with a high demand class, and finally, after much <br/>
consideration, I decided to play the class I most loved duoing with <br/>
as a monk, the Shaman. I rolled up a Barb Shaman with my new EQ <br/>
Evolutions software, and -pop- there I was, back in Halas again after <br/>
nearly a yeas absence. A lot of things came back to me, and within a <br/>
couple of hours, I hit lvl 5, got my new spells, and then I hit a <br/>
brick wall. Non of my old friends seem to be around anymore, so I <br/>
don&#39;t have them to ask for advice, so I turned to this group for <br/>
help. I have been told Steamfront is the best place to go to lvl up a <br/>
shammy for the next few cycles anyway...any thoughts on this? I am <br/>
not looking to necessarily powerlevel, though I do miss the high end <br/>
raiding, pulling in Kael , the 12 hour raids in HoT in ToV, etc and <br/>
would like to get back to those, but I am willing to put in the time <br/>
to learn this classes ins and outs, and make myself an integral part <br/>
of any group I join. So any help with where to level, etc would be <br/>
great, since it has been since early 2001 that I was a newbie the <br/>
first time.........and the old haunts seem to be deserted now. I do <br/>
like the new transport systems, made getting out of Halas much easier <br/>
than it was with my warrior ( the run to Freeport with a lvl 5 <br/>
nightblind warrior in cloth armor was harrowing lol) ...also if <br/>
anyone has a main or an alt on Tunare that would like to group with a <br/>
n00b shammy and help him get the hang of it all, send a tell to <br/>
Karudore  ..... see you all soon.<br/>
