remember back when I downloaded LoY and I had a&nbsp;dailup connection at that 
time and I couldn&#39;t play for more than 5 minutes without the game booting me off 
and having the screen YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED pop up.&nbsp; This happened for 
about a week and a half until I got DSL.&nbsp; I asked the GMs and tech people 
for help but all they could tell me was everything on the everquest 
website.&nbsp; Prior to having downloaded LoY the game worked fine on my dailup 
connection, everything was ok.&nbsp; I gotta tell you some of these people who 
work at tech assist have no idea what they are talking about and they don&#39;t 
listen to what you are saying.&nbsp; Well thats my 2cp.</font></span></div>

  did<br>to<br>&gt; make sure I had the NPC I was looking for. I&#39;d also say it 
  could be a bug,<br>&gt; but we all know there isn&#39;t any bugs in
