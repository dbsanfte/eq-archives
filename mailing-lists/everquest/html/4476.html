<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293652294">GL!  Myself, I might or might not get on my monk, but<br/>
I probably won&#39;t hunt.  I&#39;ll probably put most of my<br/>
time into my 8 froggy cleric (solo&#39;ing WC atm).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I made some serious headway tonight with my<br/>
&gt; rogue.  A few of my friends said that they&#39;d group<br/>
&gt; in Dawnshroud at the Grieg&#39;s End zone.  from<br/>
&gt; 1:30-2:30 I made my way from Frontier Mountains to<br/>
&gt; Dawnshroud Peaks.  It took that long in rogue<br/>
&gt; sneak/hide to avoid aggro.  I didn&#39;t have a sow.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We met up at Maidens eye zone.  Myself, a ranger, a<br/>
&gt; mage, another rogue, and a monk.  I said &quot;Now if we<br/>
&gt; only have a cleric&quot; and miraculously I see &quot;You guys<br/>
&gt; need a cleric?&quot; appear on my screen.  So the 6 of us<br/>
&gt; made our way to Grieg&#39;s End zone line and set up<br/>
&gt; base.  For the next 6 hours we then proceeded to<br/>
&gt; murder, slaughter, and bring the wrath upon tribals<br/>
&gt; and anything else that dared cross our paths.  In<br/>
&gt; the ntire 6 hours we had only 3 deaths.  The monk<br/>
&gt; had a higher level cleric alt with a 75% rez so we<br/>
&gt; were golden.  Everyone in the group dinged at least<br/>
&gt; once.  Our group&#39;s cleric dinged 29 and got his new<br/>
&gt; rez spell for which he was happy.  It was a good<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After the group broke up, I hung around DSP to find<br/>
&gt; another group.  I was able to do so and we had a<br/>
&gt; froglok warrior who was busting out the chain pulls.<br/>
&gt;  In the new group I managed to ding a second time. <br/>
&gt; By midnight, a mere 9 hours into it, I went from one<br/>
&gt; 6 blues to 33 to 2 yellows into 34, which is equal<br/>
&gt; to about a level and a half.  Needless to say I was<br/>
&gt; pretty pleased with myself, and I realized sometimes<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s not about what you get to look forward to, but<br/>
&gt; just the fun you have playing the character.  So I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; trying to finish off 34 this weekend and hopefully<br/>
&gt; make some good headway into 35 - maybe even 36.<br/>
