situation.  <br/>
<br/>
As I understand dual wield you keep the slow, hard hitting weapon in <br/>
the off hand.  The primary hand gauges how often you swing and how <br/>
often you get a dual or double attack.  So if you put the slower <br/>
weapon in the primary all your strikes are slower.  It really doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter whether you&#39;re the main tank or the backup.  As soon as you <br/>
cast snare you&#39;re going to get whacked!  So blaze away.  And aggro <br/>
management is only a minor issue for you, even now.  You do need to <br/>
learn it, eventually, but it will come to you!<br/>
