<div id="ygrps-yiv-780224768">Frankly I don&#39;t see what your point is.  You report<br/>
that your account has been compromised and they will<br/>
temporarly ban the account so no further possible<br/>
damage can be done.  To be honest, how many accounts<br/>
have been compromised.. that aren&#39;t caused by players<br/>
handing out their account information to &quot;so called&quot;<br/>
friends in the game?  This is not a flame..  It&#39;s only<br/>
meant as a reminder - this is a personal responsiblity<br/>
of all players.  In my 2+ years playing this game, I<br/>
have witnessed only one so called compromise.  It<br/>
involved a player handing out his information to a<br/>
friend.  How many of us lend our car keys out to<br/>
people we have merely met over the phone? =)<br/>
<br/>
Just keep your information under guard and you most<br/>
likely will never have this issue.<br/>
