<b>Subject:</b> cell shading <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723139106">We recently got Legends of Zelda: Wind Waker for our Gamecube. This <br/>
is my first experience with cell shading in games, and I was <br/>
surprised by how immersive the game is with this style of animation.<br/>
<br/>
I think a cell shaded version of EQ would be just as immersive as the <br/>
current game, and allow a broader range of computers to keep up with <br/>
game advancements. My machine was adequate for everything up to <br/>
Velious. I have not been able to get good performance on other <br/>
expansions. In a cell shaded EQ, I should be fine with my machine.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping low-end machines in the game can keep those playing who <br/>
otherwise cannot afford the upgrades for optimal performance. Plus, <br/>
people who upgrade their systems could keep their old systems in the <br/>
game, and run two accounts. <br/>
<br/>
How many of you have had experience with cell shaded games? Do you <br/>
think EQ could become cell shaded and retain all of its quality of <br/>
game play?</div>
