<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Let&#39;s look at this.&nbsp; I&#39;ve played most of the 
classes into the teens, most to the lower 20&#39;s finding out grouping and 
soloablity of each, to decide what ones I wanted to play.&nbsp; Shadowknights 
and Paladins make good backup tanks, and main tanks.&nbsp; both get the same 
weapon skills, as the Shadowknight is the &quot;anti-paladin&quot;.&nbsp; Both get Dual 
Attack at level 20, which means they get a free hit from time to time.&nbsp; 
Dual wield (1 hand weapon in each hand) is only gotten by monks, beastlords, 
rogues, rangers, and warriors.&nbsp; as far as spells, paladins get some of the 
cleric line of spells, including the buffs, heals, and resurrection 
spells.&nbsp; Shadowknights get necromancer spells, and even though they are 
powerful spells for the necro when he gets them, they just add to the power of a 
Shadowknight.&nbsp; at level 9, the shadowknight spells are some of the necro 
level 1 and 4 spells.&nbsp; the pet is a level 4 pet.&nbsp; throughout his 
career, the pet an Sk has will never be much more than half his level, and 
rarely will it be that (more easily thought of as a walking DoT).&nbsp; Neither 
class gets the spell gate.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">for soloing and grouping, it depends upon tactics, 
and knowing the strength and weaknesses of your class, in order to be successful 
with either, or both.&nbsp; </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Another class that might be good is shadowknight. The 
  drawbacks: Good races<br>won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want to 
  kill you. If you play a<br>darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally 
  suck but you get pretty<br>cool armor when you can manage to find all the 
  stuff you need for it. People<br>don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they think 
  of tanks. They don&#39;t often<br>invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they get the 
  spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br>The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon a pet to 
  tank for you<br>while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, and you get a 
  spell that<br>snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can solo alot and 
  are a good<br>asset to a group. Way later in the game you get to summon your 
  own horse<br>called an Unholy Steed.<br>My brother started a shadowknight and 
  got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br><br>Paladins are welcome in all good cities. 
  Don&#39;t usually have problems selling<br>to merchants. Get good damage, duel 
  wield, disarm. Are thought of as tanks<br>and can get into group. Can also 
  heal and buff. Can even resurrect. But they<br>cannot gate. They can solo 
  pretty well with a good weapon and armor. There<br>are newbie paladin armor 
  quests for humans and halfelves in freeport.<br><br>Druids, not really great 
  tanks but can snare/root and dot from afar. sucks<br>alot of mana. Sometimes 
  they can charm an animal to attack a mob for them.<br>But then the animal 
  turns and attacks them when charm wears off. They can<br>also track, port, and 
  heal.<br><br>If you like things to be more difficult, there&#39;s clerics. They 
  can pretty<br>much get into any group because people always seem to want a 
  healer. But<br>they can&#39;t really solo much and have alot of downtime from 
  medding.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br>&gt; It depends on your playstyle. Solo or 
  group, this will matter a lot later,<br>&gt; the druid you can solo all the 
  way to level60 with if you want and can<br>group<br>&gt; up, but the warrior 
  will have problems crossing the road without getting<br>&gt; killed without a 
  healer back him up. But the warrior is in need in numbers<br>&gt; in the highe 
  end raiding game where the druid is an assist class.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Answer 
  is: it depends on your goals.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -----Original

  maybe a bad choice<br>&gt; because i&#39;m dying more often then playing.<br>&gt; 
  What is the best way to get started, &amp; and which character is a
