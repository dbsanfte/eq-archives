<b>Subject:</b> Re: A question regarding quests... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809356032">This is a very good answer to the problem of &quot;under-rewarded&quot; quests.  I have<br/>
never done a quest, because the rewards were so light.  My daughter has done<br/>
some and I find she knows much more about Norrath than I do.  I think I should<br/>
be looking at the experience rather than my bank balance.  Gee, just like real<br/>
life!<br/>

&gt;pride of completing a job that, perhaps, no one else has completed yet.<br/>
&gt;There are more things in EQ than leveling and gaining items and money.<br/>
