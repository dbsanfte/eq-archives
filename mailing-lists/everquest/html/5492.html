&gt;little more guidance now...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I made it to Luclin to the Bazaar, but may be stuck there now...feel<br/>
&gt;like a bobble head Paly doll from all the lag.  Oh, went to Kunark<br/>
&gt;and somehow have lived to tell about it...wandered to what is called<br/>
&gt;the wizzy towers or some sort of settlement...hugged the treeline<br/>
&gt;all the way back to the PoP spires...reallllly don&#39;t want to go back<br/>
&gt;there til&#39; I am about a level 60 ;o)!  I hope I can get the items I<br/>
&gt;want and get back to Greater Faydark sometime before spring...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My first experience in the Bazaar was confusing. I felt like my character <br/>
was swimming in really thick jello. I looked around and noticed a lot of <br/>
people with their faces to the walk. Were they being punished? Hehehe. I <br/>
wondered how I could sell anything. I didn&#39;t know that I needed a trader&#39;s <br/>
satchel yet.<br/>
<br/>
On time my video card blew. I had to use the on-board video from my main <br/>
board. Needless to say, the graphics capability lacked a lot. My character <br/>
is a Val Shir. The main board video chip wasn&#39;t capable of handling the <br/>
polygons for clothing. All of the female kitty dancers at the campfire in <br/>
Thicket were completely nude. I sat down in from to the white tigress for <br/>
about 10 minutes and watched her dance. The dances were short but very <br/>
entertaining.<br/>
