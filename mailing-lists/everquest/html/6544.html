<b>Subject:</b> I can&#39;t log into my sony station account. Help. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-577245647">I have a problem. I&#39;m paid up on both my Everquest and my Everquest II<br/>
accounts. But I can&#39;t log on. Unfortunately I have to log on to tell<br/>
customer support that I can&#39;t log on so that we can get the problem fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way that I can reach sony customer support without logging on?<br/>
<br/>
They have my login name. I checked that out by telling the sony<br/>
station web page that I forgot my login name. I entered my email<br/>
address and they sent me the name I always use.<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t work with the password. I tried telling the page that I<br/>
forgot my password. I got email with a link for a page that was<br/>
supposed to send me a temporary password. The link doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody help me please. I&#39;m on my off day. I have nothing to do and<br/>
I&#39;m getting bored. G.<br/>
<br/>
