<div id="ygrps-yiv-693793488">Yes, and maybe $265 isn&#39;t that much for you. But to some other people that&#39;s<br/>
a hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a rent-to-own<br/>
basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s easy to say they<br/>
should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an escape for them. To suddenly<br/>
not be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way Verant<br/>
could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so financially<br/>
stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if nothing else.<br/>
Btw, someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap? Where was that<br/>
again? I just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of RAM with it&#39;s<br/>
motherboard and chipset.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not cost that<br/>
&gt; much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me $265 after<br/>
&gt; tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.  The chip is a AMD<br/>
&gt; Athlon 950.<br/>
