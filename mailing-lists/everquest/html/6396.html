<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637600543">Last night I tried an LDoN as the Gargoyle (lvl20) shroud and discovered <br/>
the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. I could not equip any of the weaponry.<br/>
2. Have the shrouded one collect.<br/>
<br/>
I say have the shrouded one collect simply because after you finish and <br/>
they go sell the stuff to get extra cash and then do the split, have <br/>
everyone meet over in PoK and the shrouded one drop his/her shroud and <br/>
then they access their shroud bank, all the stuff is still in there! <br/>
(except for the cash I believe.) Go sell the stuff again and do another <br/>
split. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a bug and Sony will catch it eventually and spoil <br/>
it but take advantage of it while you can!<br/>
<br/>
Later!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;hello all:<br/>
&gt;does anyone know if you can buy armour for the shrouds ???<br/>
&gt;My bear has BASH ability and it keeps telling me that I have to <br/>
&gt;equip a shield to do that <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks <br/>
