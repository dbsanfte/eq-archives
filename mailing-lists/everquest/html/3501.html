<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335490713">I agree with Barto Su, Don&#39;t give up. It will happen someday. Here let<br/>
me tell you my story and see if you feel any better ok? <br/>
<br/>
Back in 1988 I met this girl going to the local Jr. college in the town<br/>
I was living in. I was a senior in high school and we really hit it off.<br/>
I&#39;ll call her &quot;K&quot;, K and I were always together and I soon fell madly in<br/>
love with her. Soon the school year came to a close, things were<br/>
changing a little for us, I actually cut my waist long hair so her<br/>
parents wouldn&#39;t freak! Yea, I really liked her! <br/>
Well after she moved back to Denver I got a phone call from her. She<br/>
wanted to break up and see other people. Of course I was devastated,<br/>
(I&#39;m one of those sappy sensitive types), and it was hard. I agreed<br/>
because I really didn&#39;t have the experience in relationships to try and<br/>
work something out. Well two weeks pass and my graduation came. K shows<br/>
up to go to my graduation, which was cool and all but the night before<br/>
we get into this nasty fight. We&#39;re cruising along and there is a truck<br/>
full of some of my female friends fom school and they are drunk off<br/>
their ass! They&#39;re whopin&#39; and hollarin&#39; having a good ol&#39; time. Well K<br/>
suddenly jumps out of the passenger seat and practically into my lap.<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t look at them.&quot; She says to me as she entwines her arm in mine.<br/>
&quot;Excuse me? You broke up with me remember?&quot; I said back to her, &quot;I can<br/>
look at whomever I want!&quot; granted it probably wasn&#39;t the most mature way<br/>
to put it but either way we ended up into a fight. So we came home and<br/>
went to bed. (I left a bunch of non-important stuff out to save time,<br/>
btw nothing happened.)<br/>
The next morning I woke up before she did. I was lying there looking at<br/>
her and thinking this will be the last time we see each other. So I<br/>
stroke her arm ans she wakes up. We start to kiss and one thing leads to<br/>
another. It was my first time mind you so I was really nervous about<br/>
that and to top it off, my Mother was asleep in the next room! So<br/>
afterwards I ask the usual guy question, of &quot;How was I&quot; and her response<br/>
was &quot;I&#39;ve had bigger.&quot; SMAK! Oh that hurt! I was destroyed, whether or<br/>
not it was true, (My wife says she&#39;s full of crap!), it really hurt.<br/>
This began a 7 year drought for me. I completely shut myself off. I<br/>
didn&#39;t date, never went out, got into stamp collecting. ;D Man it was<br/>
rough! So finally to make an incredibly long story a little shorter I<br/>
finally got back into the dating scene. I put an ad out on<br/>
coloradosingles.com which was a great site because I&#39;ll never meet<br/>
someone say in Pennsylvania! I don&#39;t suggest going to that site now<br/>
because they are now a &quot;swinger&#39;s&quot; site, unless of course your into<br/>
that. :-)<br/>
So now you know that love can happen but it just takes time. Hey are you<br/>
going to the Denver Everquest Meetup? <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.meetup.com/">http://everquest.meetup.com/</a> I&#39;m<br/>
going to meet some fellow CO Eqer&#39;s. Who know, you might meet that<br/>
someone! ;-) <br/>

<br/>
That doesn&#39;t work. I have known several friends who either gave up or <br/>
were never looking who were most pleasantly surprised. I don&#39;t know <br/>
any who were surprised in this way who regretted the partner who came <br/>
their way. More happy than those I have know who were so desperate <br/>
for a mate that they made unwise choices.<br/>
<br/>
If you are content with your own company, then whatever way things go <br/>
you shall do well.<br/>
