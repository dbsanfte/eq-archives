<div id="ygrps-yiv-285509940">Actually, I&#39;ve noticed the opposite. Here&#39;s an example. One water and one standard ration last about the same time. One day, I accedently purchased 1 iron ration, which seemed to last about as long a 2 or 3 standard rations. Since that time, however, I&#39;ve been purchasing muffins and water mostely, and rations when I have to.<br/>

&gt;seems to last half its normal time.  If you cannot summon, fish or forage<br/>
&gt;for food, i have found that muffins@6cp and milk@7cp are the most cost<br/>

&gt;I was wondering if there was any real difference to the rations/food you can<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;buy or obtain, (like one lasts longer or gives a specific benefit) other <br/>
&gt;than weight, cost and perhaps personal preferance (IE - you prefer to carry <br/>
&gt;fish instead of bread)? The reason I&#39;m asking, is that I noticed that fish <br/>
&gt;(which can be gotten by fishing, which costs practically nothing - just the <br/>
&gt;cost of a fishing rod and bait) seem to last longer than loaves of bread <br/>
&gt;(cost around 2 SP each). I was wondering if this were true, or just my <br/>
&gt;perception of it. If this is true however, I wonder if the same were true <br/>
&gt;for drink (IE - mead or ale would last longer than water)?<br/>
