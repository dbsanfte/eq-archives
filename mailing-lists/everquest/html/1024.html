<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076096705">Dear EQ players,<br/>
          I am part of a 6 person research team at Queen&#39;s University in<br/>
Canada that is analyzing Everquest.  More specifically, I am looking at<br/>
the way people roleplay different genders in the game.  I am interested<br/>
in the reasons why people choose to play characters of different<br/>
genders.  The survey is a small part of a large paper that we are<br/>
writing for a course.  As part of our research, we are conducting a<br/>
survey on EQ players.  If you are interested, please take the time to<br/>
answer the following questions and email your responses to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:7AEW1@...">7AEW1@...</a>.  Additionally, if you  are interested in<br/>
answering more questions in depth, please indicate your interest in your<br/>
reply.  You are not obligated in any way to answer the following<br/>
questions.  Thanks for your time.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
   Naidan (Amy Wilson)<br/>
