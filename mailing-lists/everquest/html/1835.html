&gt; Ahhh a cleric .. what a noble class, I prefer rogues myself. Anyway,<br/>
&gt; for newbies I recommend that you hang out at the dwarf fishing camp<br/>
&gt; and wait for someone to work over the named dorfs there. Hey drop<br/>
&gt; serious weapons and ringmail armour. You may be able to get them to<br/>
&gt; cough up some of the goods, since selling them locally will be tough<br/>
&gt; as they are ruining their faction with the Citizens of Kaladim.<br/>
&gt; Begging never hurt either.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Welcome to EQ. =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Firstly, way to go on choosing a cleric! hehe I&#39;m biased as I play<br/>
&gt; a level 50 High Elf Cleric on Xegony. Clerics are a lot of fun imo.<br/>
&gt; As a new cleric I agree with some of the statements made below. Being<br/>
&gt; BRAND new, just solo around your starting point and loot everything.<br/>
&gt; Sell that stuff and save all the money. You will need it for spells<br/>
&gt; obviously and you&#39;ll also want to pick up some better armor than the<br/>
&gt; tunic your guild gives you. I wore leather armor for a very long time<br/>
&gt; until I had saved enough to buy something else.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When you do get higher in level and can start buying some better<br/>
&gt; items, work on buying stuff that is +wis. This will help a lot.<br/>
&gt; Farther down the road at much higher levels you will want to work on<br/>
&gt; making your AC and saves better, but you shouldn&#39;t have to worry<br/>
&gt; about that too much for quite some time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Everyone has different opinions on how to play, but the important<br/>
&gt; thing is to have fun. Find some people on your server that play in<br/>
&gt; your area. Usually you&#39;ll start seeing familiar faces.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I have a 38 dwarf cleric on The Nameless.  A few tips:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   1) Max wisdom - not all subscribe to this, but you have an inate<br/>
&gt; strength already as a dwarf.  I put my other points to bring up<br/>
&gt; either dex or agility, whichever lower<br/>
&gt; &gt;   2) Find a regular partner to help you to level at the low levels -<br/>
&gt;  you can solo first few levels, but I found grouping with one other<br/>
&gt; PC helped<br/>
&gt; &gt;   3) As a cleric, go to Kurn&#39;s tower around level ten - lots of<br/>
&gt; undead to nuke on when alone and clerics were always welcome in<br/>
&gt; groups there<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Use the other yahoogroups specifically for clerics for more help<br/>
&gt; and advice: EQ_Cleric@y... and EQ-Clerics@y... - Some of the folks<br/>
&gt; there are quite, er, vocal and opinionated, hehe.  But we all know<br/>
&gt; that Dwarves make the best clerics - you picked the right race.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Use Caster&#39;s Realm and Rayne&#39;s cleric site for cleric reference<br/>
&gt; information.  Also Allakhazam&#39;s for a lot of general information.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Hey guys,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I know I&#39;m about 2 years late but better late than never.  I am<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Ayonae Ro and just made a dwarf cleric.  Any little tips and<br/>
&gt; advice<br/>
&gt; &gt;   thrown my way will be very appreciated.  Beside saving up fo rmy<br/>
&gt; &gt;   spell, I bought the book, should I invest next for my armor?<br/>
&gt; weapon?<br/>
&gt; &gt;   or misc items such as rings?  Thanks again.<br/>
