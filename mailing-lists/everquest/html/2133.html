<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-553792363">Yes. I had it with my soundblaster before and still to some bit with my new<br/>
philips sound card. My mom&#39;s computer doesn&#39;t seem to do it. She has a<br/>
pentium while I have an athlon.  It is extremely annoying. and I get high<br/>
pitched whines. I know it&#39;s not the sound card bc my mom has the same sound<br/>
card. I&#39;m wondering if it somehow has something to do with the processor? I<br/>
dunno. It&#39;s weird and annoying.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone else have problems with &quot;choppy&quot; sound in game? I am<br/>
&gt; currently running a 1.2 gHz Gateway Athlon system with 512 MB of PC-<br/>
&gt; 133 SDRAM, nVidia GeForce 2 Ultra with 64 MB, and a Sound Blaster<br/>
&gt; Live! X-Gamer 5.1 sound card. Operating System is Windows XP Home<br/>
&gt; Edition. Connection is via aDSL. I have downloaded and installed all<br/>
&gt; the latest drivers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My sound, particularly the music, &quot;stutters&quot; and repeats in the game<br/>
&gt; to the point it is almost unbearably annoying and I have to turn the<br/>
&gt; speakers off or way down. It does not appear to affect the video<br/>
&gt; and/or gameplay, but I should think my system is more than adequate<br/>
&gt; to play the game with sound turned on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do have the Luclin expansion, and I have turned on a FEW of the<br/>
&gt; new skins, but only those of the races and genders of my own<br/>
&gt; characters: Wood Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, and Human (necessary to<br/>
&gt; display Erudite). I also have horses and elementals turned on, but<br/>
&gt; that is all. Social animations, mip mapping, texture mapping, and<br/>
&gt; texture compression are off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have tried turning the sound acceleration down in Control Panel,<br/>
&gt; but that appears to have no effect on the choppiness of the sound. I<br/>
&gt; also turned sound realism up and turned off reverb by using /reverb<br/>
&gt; in the chat box, at one person&#39;s suggestion. Does anyone have any<br/>
&gt; ideas/tips/solutions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
