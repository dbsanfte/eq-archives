<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887114680">Hehehe I loved those days...<br/>
<br/>
I relived the feelings when I was a level 19 druid (ack...was??...still am)<br/>
and I was ported to DL and levitated and camo&#39;ed and ran east.<br/>
<br/>
EVERYTHING IS RED!!!<br/>
<br/>
I made it the second time....(first time I didn&#39;t notice the levitation<br/>
running out)<br/>

&gt; Yeah! When I first started playing I was actually scared. A thunderstorm<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; started and I was sitting there wide-eyed asking my sister (over the<br/>
&gt; phone)<br/>
&gt; if lightning could hurt people. When I tried to follow her everything<br/>
&gt; seemd<br/>
&gt; so big.. I had never played this type of game before. It was amazing...<br/>
&gt; I still get my pulse up when running from a train. :-)<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am rather new to the game, but one of the things that fascinates me<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the real sense of danger when I put my character in a new<br/>
&gt; &gt; situation. Heart pounds, pulse rate goes up, I even get the shakes<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes. I seldom get that in real life, even though I have a job<br/>
&gt; &gt; that requires occasional physical combat.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I love this game!<br/>
