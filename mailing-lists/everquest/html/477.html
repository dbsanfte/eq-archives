<div id="ygrps-yiv-8046357">I think you have some great ideas..  I like the thing about vendors - but I<br/>
do think that you should still be able to buy and sell from a vendor even if<br/>
you can&#39;t speak the same language.  I had no difficulty shopping in Europe<br/>
even in Eastern Berlin where it seemed that no one over the age of 30 could<br/>
speak much English...<br/>
<br/>
Also - they could start Ogres, Trolls and the like with limited Common<br/>
experience which would mangle their speech in groups until it developed..<br/>
