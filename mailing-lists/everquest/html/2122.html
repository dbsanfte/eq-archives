<b>Subject:</b> Selling Shovel, more advice needed <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597337766">Last night I had the pleasure of someone making me an<br/>
offer for my shovel, The problem is he was very pushy<br/>
and didn&#39;t not give me a chance to think about it.<br/>
<br/>
He offered me 30PP for it and some dagger.  Told me I<br/>
couldn&#39;t use it to its fullest.  I am a level 3 Druid<br/>
halfling.  It is a wee harvester and I can&#39;t remember<br/>
its stats and such but my question is should I have<br/>
sold it because I didn&#39;t.?  I kept it.  It is magical<br/>
and makes food for me.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else also told me to buy my level 1 and level<br/>
5 spells.  I take it there are no level 2,3,4?  Should<br/>
I look for the spells in this order<br/>
Buff<br/>
Heal<br/>
Str<br/>
Combat<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, You all have been very helpful<br/>
<br/>
Rob<br/>
