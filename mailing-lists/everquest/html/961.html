<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello all! 
<p>We are looking for several adventurous souls to join us in forming a new 
guild on Fennin Ro. Our purpose will be to enjoy this game for all it&#39;s worth -- 
to help each other, to teach those new to Norrath the skills they will need to 
survive. Rules will be simple -- things such as never beg, never ks, and always 
help your guildmate first. We will also be focused on life in Norrath being more 
than just the battle -- other skills are given to you for a reason. Want to 
learn how to tailor? You&#39;ve got to start with the basics, and if you and a 
couple of guildmates want a nice quiet night, why not go out together and gather 
spiderling silks to get going? Or get together for a trip to Steamfont to pick 
up some supplies for smithing? 
<p>We will also be planning raids for various levels, a couple of parties... and 
maybe even a wedding or two. ) 
<p>So if you&#39;re interested in helping us create this guild, just to have fun, 
either leave a post here, or email to akane@... with your character 
name, level, class and race, along with an email address where we can reach you. 

<p>Look forward to hearing from you! )
