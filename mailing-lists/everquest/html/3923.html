<div id="ygrps-yiv-126747738">There is a very easy way to make decent platinum at relatively low levels,<br/>
like 10 and above, perhaps even a bit lower.<br/>
<br/>
There are two aqua goblin camps just south of the Butcherblock docks, along<br/>
the shore. The goblins there are about level 8-10 and drop 4 items that are<br/>
worth 4-5 plat each, depending on the merchant, and your charisma. The<br/>
goblins are aggressive to everyone, it seems, and will gang aggro.<br/>
<br/>
Backbones, Dirjadak&#39;s chipped stein, aqua goblin heads, and goblin blood are<br/>
the good drops. The backbones and blood stack, the heads and steins do not.<br/>
so take lots of backpacks along. I made over 300pp there in about an hour<br/>
with a level 14 magician. The biggest problem there is finding a time when<br/>
these gobbies are not camped. Don&#39;t sell to the high elf merchant in the<br/>
ruins nearby, he is a cheapskate. Wait till you have tons of loot and then<br/>
trek over to Kaladim, if your faction allows. I have gotten decent prices<br/>
from Vacto Molunel, at the entrance to the warrior&#39;s guild.<br/>
<br/>
A few trips there, and then to the Bazaar, and you can be decently equipped<br/>
without twinking.<br/>
