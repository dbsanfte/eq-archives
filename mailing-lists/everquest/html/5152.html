<div id="ygrps-yiv-221455008">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
This is an odd request, but I am looking for some Everquest players that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind being interviewed either by IM, phone, or if practical in person. I <br/>
am a graduate student at the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute of <br/>
Technology in Chicago. For one of my classes, entitled Observing Users, we <br/>
have to study a product and its users. Our group chose Everquest because we <br/>
think that it is very interesting and complex. As a retired online gamer I know <br/>
how much fun and involving the games can be. In fact, I am very tempted to <br/>
jump into Everquest, but I am worried that I may lose concentration on my <br/>
studies. If anyone is willing to devote a little of their time to helping us out we <br/>
would really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are poor grad students and will <br/>
not be able to compensate anyone who helps us out, but we will very very <br/>
thankful. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Andrew Haywood</div>
