<b>Subject:</b> General rule for posting links <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-267191313">Hey folks,<br/>
It just occurred to me that I haven&#39;t said much about the rules on posting<br/>
links.<br/>
Someone just reminded me of a rule I should have stipulated.<br/>
When you post a link to something, please have a description of what the<br/>
link is to (preferably mentioning EverQuest).<br/>
Just posting a link is something spammers do, so if you do post a link<br/>
without a description, people are likely to mistake it for spam.<br/>
I&#39;m not picking on anyone or anything. It&#39;s my fault for not setting this<br/>
rule earlier. (well, not really a rule, but more of a request).<br/>
luv,<br/>
