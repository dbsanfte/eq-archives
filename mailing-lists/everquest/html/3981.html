<p>The Forge in Felwith is a &quot;Cultural Forge&quot; it can only be used with the High Elf Reciepes, you have to use the forge in kelethin to do normal smithing - i dont know if theres a normal forge in felwith i have never found one.</p>
<p>the crude bricks of bronze can most often be found in Butcherblock on venders and i think they drop from the goblins and orcs i think they also drop in CB but much rarer than in Buthcerblock i think.</p>

<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Well EQ got me hooked. 
<div></div>&gt; I started playing about 2 months ago and am really enjoying 
<div></div>&gt;myself. But I am stuck. I use the diff. infomation and maps you can 
<div></div>&gt;find on the net as well as equipment list ect to help me find things 
<div></div>&gt;for quests ect. well I am stumped... 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;I am working on a High Elf Pally and am really enjoying building this 
<div></div>&gt;guy up. I started working on the Felwithe Defenders Falchion quest. 
<div></div>&gt;I am 8th level and the quest is rated 10th to 15th level.I started 
<div></div>&gt;the quest (talking to the Seria elf in the pally house) I killed the 
<div></div>&gt;masked spy and the Gen. Orc (with the help of a Dwarf with a Big 
<div></div>&gt;hammer.) (Note: the Spy and the Gen. Orc can be found talking 
<div></div>&gt;together at -2096.28, 2326.77 in Greater Faydark)and they can be 
<div></div>&gt;pulled with spells one at a time) I got their heads and turned them 
<div></div>&gt;in to Seria and got the dull sword I&#39;m to sharpen the sword, and turn 
<div></div>&gt;it in with some arborean amber and a P.forest drakeling scale to get 
<div></div>&gt;the first pally sword....well the dum sword will not sharpen, I use 1 
<div></div>&gt;and 2 sharping stones, the sword and put them in the forge in the 
<div></div>&gt;armorer&#39;s shop and I&#39;m told &quot;these idems will not combine try another 
<div></div>&gt;forge...WHAT other forge?? My first ? is..is there another forge in 
<div></div>&gt;the high elf city and if so where or is it because I am only 8th 
<div></div>&gt;level? 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;my 2nd ? is on the first Pally armor quest where or what in the name 
<div></div>&gt;of all the good gods can I find or what is &quot;Brick of crude Bronze&quot; 
<div></div>&gt;and where can I find/make them (I need 2 for my first peace of armor) 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Thanks
