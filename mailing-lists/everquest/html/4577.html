<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765852384">actually since my last post i havent had a problem getting groups <br/>
even tho i never got a response from anyone here and over the last <br/>
week i have been main tank over any other class ive grouped with sk <br/>
war doesnt matter since as a pally i have similar spells to a cleric <br/>
if there isnt one in group i can buff myself with symbol and if there <br/>
is no cleric available to rez the unfortunate dead group member on <br/>
occasions pallys can rez but back to the main tank part of it i dunno <br/>
if its just because pallys have higher ac and hp than sks there level <br/>
or if its just the gear i have <br/>
