<div id="ygrps-yiv-907963848">Hiya Newb =)<br/>
it&#39;s easy<br/>
to do regular chat<br/>
just hit enter and type your msg<br/>
here&#39;s the low down<br/>
/say - hi<br/>
/g - /group - So and So tells the group &quot;hi&quot;<br/>
/guild - so and so tells the guild &quot;hi&quot;<br/>
/shout - so and so shouts &quot;hi&quot;<br/>
/ooc - so and so says in ooc &quot;hi&quot;<br/>
/auc - /auction - so and so says in auction &quot;hi&quot;<br/>
/t - /tell - so and so tells this person &quot;hi&quot;<br/>
also to reply to a /tell when someone sends you a tell, just hit r<br/>
btw there are short cuts to chats<br/>
just hit / then a the shothand or type it out heh<br/>
or when replying to a tell just hit r<br/>
and when sending a tell just hit t<br/>
there are also server wide tells LOL but won&#39;t get into that, I <br/>
don&#39;t even use it.<br/>
hope that helps for that chat<br/>
casting is easy, just gotta memeroize the spell then click on it to <br/>
cast, make sure you have something targeted you want to cast it on,<br/>
DD - direct damage<br/>
DOT - damage over time<br/>
those you wanna cast on the enemy of course ^_^<br/>
then there are shields and healing spells that you want to cast on <br/>
yourself and friends hehe<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone.  I just got the game Everquest and am so confused!  I <br/>
read <br/>
&gt; through the manual and can get around but how do you cast spells, <br/>
talk to <br/>
&gt; people around you, etc.??  I&#39;m about to give up lol.  I&#39;d tell you <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; characters name but I can&#39;t remember. :)  She is in the first <br/>
world though.  <br/>
&gt; Thanks ahead of time for any advice/help you can give me!<br/>
