<p>Seriously, I like it here. People seem to be able to state their opinions just fine here. I never got the feeling that anyone was trying to tell TC that he/she should get a dino or horse, just that there were more benefits to having one than he/she seemed to realize.
<p>And isn&#39;t that why we are part of mailing groups like this? To learn more about the game?

I left <br>this<br>&gt; &gt; group once before because of idiotic members who insisted on <br>forcing<br>&gt; &gt; their opinions apon others, and I will not put up with it. I have<br>&gt; &gt; better things to do with my time then spend it with opinionated <br>low<br>&gt; &gt; lifes. Su, I&#39;m sorry for everything, none of this goes to you, I <br>know<br>&gt; &gt; you tired, but there are just too many morons to filter out of the<br>&gt; &gt; group. To the rest of you, you will never get anywhere in life <br>with<br>&gt; &gt; the attitudes you have. Only in a fantasy game like EverQuest will<br>&gt; &gt; you ever be something. But at some point you need to grow up and <br>face<br>&gt; &gt; reality, and it&#39;s not going to be fun or easy when you do. Do not<br>&gt; &gt; bother replying to this post. Leave your fights and comments out <br>of<br>&gt; &gt; Su&#39;s group and for once in your life respect her wishes and be<br>&gt; &gt; CONSIDERATE. If you forgot what that word means, get a <br>dictionary. If<br>&gt; &gt; you MUST comment, e-mail me personally, but I most likely will <br>just<br>&gt; &gt; delete the message. Like I said, I have better things to do. Good<br>&gt; &gt; day.&nbsp; <br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; -= Mippon - Level 40 Halfling Druid =-<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Does this guy read the same posts I do?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &lt;shrug&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Bye, I guess.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Matt<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Honig Wayfarer <br>&gt; 57 Ranger<br>&gt; Cazic Thule<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com/">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
