<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-335970569">Anyone know a relatively safe way to test dragon faction? I want to go<br/>
to Cobalt Scar, and have killed lots of giants. However, I am not sure<br/>
how to find a safe place to check my faction before porting in. Hate<br/>
to pop in and die, then have trouble finding help to gather my<br/>
carcass. I don&#39;t currently have a guild, so getting assistance is<br/>
often a problem.<br/>
