<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610880067">How about having a NPC which can summon your corpse to a safe point,<br/>
with all gear intact. Have a cash fee based on level. That way, if you<br/>
can&#39;t (or don&#39;t want to) travel back to the point of death, you can<br/>
pay the fee and have your corpse summoned.<br/>

&gt; Good point. The only good thing I thought of for corpse runs was<br/>
that you<br/>
&gt; can be summoned back to your corpse so you don&#39;t have to make the<br/>
trek to<br/>
&gt; wherever you died all over again. But yeah, if you can&#39;t find your<br/>
corpse<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a royal pain.<br/>
&gt; Would you have it so you have all your gear but can still be rezzed? or<br/>
&gt; would you just eliminate rezzes?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Or, if you could go back in time and change something about<br/>
Everquest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; during<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s creation to have certain features, what would you have done<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; differently?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Definitely I would get rid of the corpse-hunting. I understand<br/>
losing exp<br/>
&gt; &gt; when you die, I think that&#39;s a good thing (well not GOOD but it makes<br/>
&gt; sense) but<br/>
&gt; &gt; going back to find your body to get all your stuff back just sucks.<br/>
&gt; Especially<br/>
&gt; &gt; when you die somewhere you can&#39;t get back to. WHY can&#39;t you ever<br/>
find a<br/>
&gt; necro<br/>
&gt; &gt; when you need one?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Sail to your heart&#39;s desires, and know when to drop anchor.&quot;<br/>
