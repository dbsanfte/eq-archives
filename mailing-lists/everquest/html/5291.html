<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699821328">One thing that I noticed: if you have the very same type of arrows in<br/>
your ammo slot and in your quiver, the arrows in the ammo slot will be<br/>
used until it only contains one arrow, then the arrows will be pulled<br/>
from the quiver. If you have a different type of arrow in your quiver<br/>
than is in your ammo slot, the last arrow will be pulled from the ammo<br/>
slot (leaving it empty) and no arrows will be pulled from the quiver.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; Iksar Monk<br/>
&gt; but have been playing my 5 Wood Elf Ranger lately.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My ranger has a quiver that he keeps his arrows in.  I saw a tip when<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; logged on that says keeping arrows in a quiver decreases attack time.<br/>
&gt;  I can<br/>
&gt; not get him to draw from his quiver.  The only arrows he uses are in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; ammo slot.  The quiver will not fit in the ammo slot.  If I have no<br/>
&gt; arrows<br/>
&gt; in the ammo slot I get a message &quot;Out Of Ammunition&quot; when I try and<br/>
&gt; use my<br/>
&gt; bow, even with my quiver full.  I have tried putting the quiver on my<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; and it won&#39;t fit there either.  I have asked a bunch of people in<br/>
&gt; game with<br/>
&gt; no luck, searched the web and looked in my hint book.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While on the subject of archers, my bow and arrows each have a range<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; damage rating.  My bow is Range 75 Damage 8 (I think).  My arrows are<br/>
&gt; Range<br/>
&gt; 25 Damage 1.  What is my range and damage?  100 and 9 by adding the<br/>
&gt; numbers,<br/>
&gt; 25 and 1 taking the lower of each?  Something else?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
