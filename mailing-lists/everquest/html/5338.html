<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008635168">Very well spoken. It&#39;s true. Most people who get THAT<br/>
lost in EQ are the kind of people who would become<br/>
lost in something else, if they hadn&#39;t found EQ to<br/>
fill their time. I have a toddler and I make sure he&#39;s<br/>
taken care of, fed, played with and put to bed before<br/>
I dive into the world of Norrath :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I beg to differ. I know people who let their house<br/>
&gt; go, play from the time they get home from work til<br/>
&gt; the time they go to bed, and their small children<br/>
&gt; live there knowing they come second to a video game.<br/>
&gt; Another person I know is a huge lady. She tells me<br/>
&gt; that she loves EQ and spends all her free time there<br/>
&gt; because where else can she be beautiful and skinny.<br/>
&gt; She has children too. I keep hearing about how they<br/>
&gt; get up to go to bed and find their kids asleep on<br/>
&gt; the floor near their computer desk and they didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even realize the children were there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It is sad. And I think this happens far more than<br/>
&gt; people will admit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I think it is a true addiction for some.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
