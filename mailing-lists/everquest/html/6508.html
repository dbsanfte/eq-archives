&gt; &gt; The old system of alchemy is in the process of being overhauled. A<br/>
&gt; &gt; year ago, I did the kitty shaman alchemy quests just short of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; epic. I lost interest and decided that it was more fun to just lvl<br/>
&gt;by<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now I have a lvl 43 shaman with 21 points in alchemy. The trainers<br/>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t increase my points above that until I actually atart using<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill. G.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The old formulas have changed. Has anyone worked out the best way<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bring the alchemy points up yet with the new formulas? I&#39;m doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; homework on this too. It&#39;s still in progress. I&#39;ll share what I<br/>
&gt;find.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has someone else already invented the wheel? G.<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t know if the site is still around, but www.eqtraders.com used<br/>
&gt;to be where I went to find out about recipes and skilling up in<br/>
&gt;tradeskills.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m up to lvl 45 with my shaman now. I just got a bigger hunting dog. I&#39;m <br/>
going to work my experience up just a bit more before I try hunting the <br/>
elite giants. The coned blue when I was at 44 but the till beat me down <br/>
faster than I could beat them down. Berserkers coned blue to but I could <br/>
beat them down a little bit faster except when I had a dire wolf chewing on <br/>
me at the same time. I&#39;m watching the tracks closer. I died several times <br/>
while slugging it out with a berserker when a couple of wolves walked up <br/>
behind me.<br/>
