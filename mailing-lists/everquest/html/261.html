<div id="ygrps-yiv-148798843">Ok, back to an EQ topic....<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering what people thought about this. I have a couple<br/>
characters (Mithe on Cathic-Thule and another druid there). Everytime I<br/>
get to that character selection screen I debate, should I play my ranger<br/>
or druid. If I play the druid I will greatly fall behind my friends that<br/>
only play one character. To solve this I&#39;d love to see /who friends<br/>
available from the character selection or server selection screen that<br/>
way i could tell who was on and on which server. Say I click on<br/>
Cathic-Thule and see my high level friends are not on I could decide to<br/>
start a new character on PVP server etc...<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think. If you agree petition or suggest this when<br/>
online.<br/>
<br/>
thanks</div>
