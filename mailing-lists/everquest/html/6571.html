<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191672552"><div>I would dare to say that most of us learned the game by playing or using knowledge gained from other MMO&#39;s.</div>
<div>but yo uasked how to make more room in your inventory?&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way to do this is to buy/get bags, boxes and/or other containers.</div>
<div>this goes for your bank/broker slots as well.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>the Broker is a place where you place your items to sell.&nbsp; First you must have a container (like a box or bag or something)</div>
<div>placed in the broker slot.. you then put items into that bag, and then set the price at which you want to sell the items.</div>
<div>if you want more slots, you will need to buy a bigger house.. so don&#39;t worry about that yet. =)</div>
<div>when your items sell, then when you talk to the broker again, he&#39;ll give you the money that you earned.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>there is also a way to sell your items directly though your house, I&#39;m not going to explain it here because I don&#39;t</div>
<div>want to totally confuse you.. but just to know that the option is there. =)</div>
