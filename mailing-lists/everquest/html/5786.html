<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043169616">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Danielle and I&#39;m quite new with EverQuest. It is my husband <br/>
indeed who kind of made me interested in the game on the internet as <br/>
he is very good at it and can play hours (when I say hours I mean <br/>
LOTS of hours!!!) in a row!! I saw him playing a straight 24 hours <br/>
recently.... :) So hopefully this group will help me understand the <br/>
addiction it does create!! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!!<br/>
<br/>
Danielle</div>
