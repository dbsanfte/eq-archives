<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079728128">Hi!  new to the list.  I play on the Tunare server.  I have a 13 Iksar Monk<br/>
but have been playing my 5 Wood Elf Ranger lately.<br/>
<br/>
My ranger has a quiver that he keeps his arrows in.  I saw a tip when I<br/>
logged on that says keeping arrows in a quiver decreases attack time.  I can<br/>
not get him to draw from his quiver.  The only arrows he uses are in the<br/>
ammo slot.  The quiver will not fit in the ammo slot.  If I have no arrows<br/>
in the ammo slot I get a message &quot;Out Of Ammunition&quot; when I try and use my<br/>
bow, even with my quiver full.  I have tried putting the quiver on my back<br/>
and it won&#39;t fit there either.  I have asked a bunch of people in game with<br/>
no luck, searched the web and looked in my hint book.<br/>
<br/>
While on the subject of archers, my bow and arrows each have a range and<br/>
damage rating.  My bow is Range 75 Damage 8 (I think).  My arrows are Range<br/>
25 Damage 1.  What is my range and damage?  100 and 9 by adding the numbers,<br/>
25 and 1 taking the lower of each?  Something else?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</div>
