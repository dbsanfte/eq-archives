<b>Subject:</b> Re: how do you make a twinkie? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-937059476">Just in case this is a serious question, I like to use some of the <br/>
rooms in Freeport as a twinking place. Some are on upper floors, <br/>
seldom visited. I usually only do this when there are not a lot of <br/>
people on, to reduce the probability of someone picking up my drop.<br/>
<br/>
I get my twinker and twinkie in the same place, make the drop, log <br/>
twinker off, log twinkie on, make the pick up.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part I keep this in a rp mode by having twinkie and <br/>
twinker be cousins, one passing to the other such things as relatives <br/>
might to help each other out. No super-twinks. A bit of a push, but <br/>
it works for me. <br/>
<br/>
My primary and first alt are from Rivervale, and I found a few good <br/>
twink spots there as well. However, one of them I moved to Freeport <br/>
and had bound there, so my higher level character visits him in <br/>
Freeport from time to time.<br/>
