<b>Subject:</b> Inside HighPass <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-776029303">The subject of highpass brough something from the back of my mind: once when i<br/>
was searching through the upper part of the castle i desovered many locked secret<br/>
doors, ie.. a plain wall that I barely walk through only to see a door that won&#39;t<br/>
budge. This may be an interesting subject for thieves with lockpicking to<br/>
explore. Also I was wondering of any quests in highpass. Lasty has anyone been<br/>
down into the dungeon area of highkeep? The first sentry monster I conned was red<br/>
to a 17th level character. This is the area past the man that sell smithing raw<br/>
materials down near the bank, not in the prison area however. Also If you are of<br/>
good alignment don&#39;t talk to prisoners they will kill on talk and they can leave<br/>
there cells and gaurds will not kill them. They are similar in look to the madmen<br/>
of RO. Oh, and has anyone gambled at the 100pp minumum table in the casino in<br/>
highkeep?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
