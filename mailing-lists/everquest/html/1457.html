<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754683143">I&#39;m not a core roleplayer.  And it&#39;s still sad to me to see a lower level <br/>
with better stuff than me.  I&#39;ll get it one day so I&#39;m not envious.  I just <br/>
hate to see it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It isnt sad, its real life. These things happen every day, both in-game and<br/>
 outside. If you are a core roleplayer just think of it as he had a rich<br/>
 uncle. If not well, you would do it yourself if you had a chance. Simply<br/>
 nothing to moan about.<br/>
 <br/>
 Envy wont help you one bit. Most likely hes gone through the &quot;i killed 2000<br/>
 rats and then 2000 orc pawns&quot; with another character and its not appealing<br/>
 to do it again.<br/>
