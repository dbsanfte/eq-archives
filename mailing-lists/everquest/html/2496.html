<div id="ygrps-yiv-949221826"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I only recently heard about this on the radio, where a computer boffin<br/>
 </span></blockquote>explained how BT and other phone companies were splitting lines (Radio2 -<br/>
Jimmy Young show, so fairly reliable).  He said that he had the very same<br/>
problem, and that if you complain long enough and loud enough they will give<br/>
you ALL of the service you are paying for.  If i had this problem i wouldnt<br/>
rest until they either gave me a full line / bandwidth or reduced my line<br/>
rental accordingly.  If youre paying the usual line rental charges, Sue,<br/>
then dont be a fool - get onto them and say the word Solicitor as often and<br/>
as loud as you can.  Bottom line - you are being scammed!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know. I told my mom I was sure we were being scammed. I said to her over<br/>
and over &quot;Why should we pay full price for lines when we only get partial<br/>
bandwidth?&quot;<br/>
The phone companies always say the same bs thing. They calim they are only<br/>
required to provide about 9K of bandwidth and that they do not have to give<br/>
any more.<br/>
I called numerous times to speak to people. Got transferred around and was<br/>
basically told to go f*** myself. And they weren&#39;t even that polite about<br/>
it. I was hoping to find some type of consumer advocates group or some kind<br/>
of consumer report to back us up. I mean, it&#39;s f***ing nuts that we&#39;re<br/>
paying $30 a line (NOT including long distance) and can barely hear anyone<br/>
on the phone. the guy who came to fix the line said that it&#39;s our phone. We<br/>
tried several phones. all of them brand new. The lines are just bad. The box<br/>
that has the phonelines which is only 1/2 a mile down the road is knocked<br/>
over. We lose clarity when it rains. We asked them to check on it and they<br/>
claimed they did and that nothing is wrong.<br/>
In the very least we want to fight them to get our money back for the 3 days<br/>
we didnt get phone service bc they screwed up our line. Not to mention that<br/>
bc it caused our phone to be constantly ringing  (it was one loud<br/>
noninterrupted noise and the digital display thingy said that it was<br/>
ringing) it gave my mom a massive headache, prevented her from sleeping, and<br/>
ruined one of our brand new phones. And they haven&#39;t reinstated our caller<br/>
ID yet. So we shouldn&#39;t have to pay full price for crap service.<br/>
They didn&#39;t even set our lines up the way they were supposed to in the first<br/>
place. Did you know that the less bandwidth you have, the less phones you<br/>
can have on your lines? I&#39;m thinking of making that an issue with them.<br/>
If you happen to see anything on the &#39;net about this type of thing can you<br/>
pass along the urls, please?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; Yup. I have a special wire just for modems. Brand new. Was connecting at<br/>
 </span></blockquote>24k<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; before. Now max is 26k.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s because I&#39;m being a slick. Basically the phone company was lazy and<br/>
&gt; rather than giving me a full phone line, they set up a slick where they<br/>
&gt; spliced up existing lines and spread them out among houses in my area. So<br/>

&gt; out he confirmed that we&#39;re behind a slick. Said that the bandwidth was<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; out from behind the slick they didn&#39;t know what one was. After I explained<br/>
&gt; they denied that I was behind one. I told them that I had been informed by<br/>
&gt; someone who worked on the phone lines that I was and that he even told me<br/>
&gt; the location of the slick. So I have 10 miles of spliced lines. Hell, when<br/>
&gt; they worked on my neighbors lines they turned off my caller ID, call<br/>
&gt; waiting, and disabled my main phone line for 3 days. Well, the line wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; working for 3 days. it kept saying it was busy bc they mixed it up with my<br/>
&gt; neighbors. the call waiting and caller ID still aren&#39;t working. I&#39;m trying<br/>
&gt; to find some type of solution to get decent lines. But I can&#39;t even get TV<br/>
&gt; out where I live-- or get my road paved. so I&#39;m probably out of luck.<br/>
&gt; Sorry for the rant.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt; Have you tried replacing your modem wire? The one that plugs into the<br/>

&gt;   &gt; there are hints about the bandwidth EQ needs on the official EQ site,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; but it is somewhat hard to find ... it is sort of information for ISPs<br/>
&gt;   &gt; so they know how much traffic within an hour or so can occur playing<br/>
&gt;   &gt; this game.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Well, when I was connecting around 40k we could have 3 people on at the<br/>
&gt; same<br/>
&gt;   time and not have lag too badly.<br/>
&gt;   but our phone lines here just suck so bad. We can barely hear over the<br/>
&gt; phone<br/>
&gt;   but the phone company keeps saying there&#39;s nothing wrong with our lines.<br/>
&gt;   Not that I&#39;m bitter mind you. ;-)<br/>
&gt;   luv,<br/>
