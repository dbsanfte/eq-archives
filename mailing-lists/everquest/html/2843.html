 </span></blockquote>I tried AO when it first came out.  It was so laggy you really <br/>
couldn&#39;t play.  I gave it 6 weeks and saw only minor improvements.  <br/>
But the worst part were the missions all got boring.  Go here, kill <br/>
this, sometimes bring it back, oh sorry that mission is broken, you <br/>
get nothing.<br/>
<br/>
And you think Verant customer service is bad!  Read some of the AO <br/>
sites.  You can find them on most of the major EQ sites.  These guys <br/>
were terrible!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stick with EQ.  No, I haven&#39;t seen a GM event in months, but on <br/>
TT our GM&#39;s seem to be asleep at the wheel anyway.  At least until <br/>
Star Wars comes out...</div>
