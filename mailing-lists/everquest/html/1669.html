   I have to agre with SU.  I have an I/O magic card that has the TNT 2 M64<br/>
chip mad e by Nvidia.  It is a 32 MB AGP vidieo card.  It cost me $107 after<br/>
tax now they are cheaper about $70-$80 or so.<br/>
Good liuck.  The card has open GL not 3d glide which is a product of 3dfx<br/>
vodoo chipsets.<br/>
