&gt;You can always use a piercing weapon later in the game cause thats what you<br/>
&gt;are limited to in the beginning. Hence you will probably have piercing <br/>
&gt;skill<br/>
&gt;maxed out , due to your high int.  Most weapons ( if you use any at all )<br/>
&gt;later on in the game will be 2H blunt weapons, therefore its best to get<br/>
&gt;yourself a worn great staff as soon as you can and build your skill for <br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt;future 2H staffs.<br/>

could give me on what to do, its not that imp for me as a wizard, but every <br/>
hit counts :)!<br/>
