He&#39;s not very big but he can punch pretty hard&quot;. He also did the same with some prisoners in Highkeep. Took them to the warrior room. Nobody believed him and started killing the prisoners. My bro was like &quot;NO! He&#39;s my friend!!&quot; When they looted the corpses he was like &quot;NOOO!
