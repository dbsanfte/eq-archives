<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880427504">I&#39;m afraid I have nothing good to say about Legends. I subscibed, and on the <br/>
confirmation screen it said I would be billed March 24, 2002.<br/>
I thought GREAT! A free month. So I had my 26 war transfered over and tried <br/>
to play. HAHAHA Legends is for people who want to be in a large guild of <br/>
&#39;uber&#39; people, cause the stuff that is new and great, you can only go after <br/>
if you are high level. I don&#39;t care what Verant says. The good stuff is for <br/>
high level chars. Period. They revamped Cazic Thule zone, and its all Level <br/>
40+ chars..I don&#39;t know what else they did. But I wasn&#39;t impressed, though I <br/>
guess if I was level 60 with a bunch of level 60 friends it might be ok.<br/>
THEN....I got a notice from my bank. Now, I only use this account to pay <br/>
EverQuest fees (I hate banks) so I only put 10 bucks a month in, plus maybe <br/>
10 more to use if I need a soda at the store or something and I don&#39;t have <br/>
cash on me. The notice said I had been billed 39.95 (USD) for EverQuest on <br/>
February 27, 2002. Thank Goodness for overdraft protection...though I get <br/>
charged a 22 dollar fee for every transaction that they pay. So, I had <br/>
bought a soda, and EverQuest went through first...so I had 2 bounced debits <br/>
and 2- $22 fees.....I&#39;m minus about 80 dollars in my account and our only <br/>
income is from grants my hubby gets to go to school. I called EQ, they said <br/>
sorry, but since the character got transfered over, we can&#39;t do anything.<br/>
<br/>
So I filed a formal complaint against Verant Interactive with the Federal <br/>
Trade Commission, because they, in effect, stole my money, and caused me big <br/>
problems with my bank.<br/>
<br/>
BUT I&#39;m such a damn addict I find myself unable to totally cancel my account <br/>
/sigh....I feel like a hypocrit, but what can I do?<br/>

&gt;Legend is $40 a month.  ALL new content in Everquest will go into Legend <br/>
&gt;first, and normal servers will suffer because of it, only getting new <br/>
&gt;updates as they filter out from Legend.  The new content and improvements <br/>
&gt;will obviously come through to regular servers slower than in the past, in <br/>
&gt;order for Verant to justify the high subscription to Legend and keep those <br/>
&gt;few elite and rich players interested.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You might gather I dont subscribe to the Legend server :)<br/>
