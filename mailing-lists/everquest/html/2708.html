<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149590979">I just hit level 30 last night, and being the Druid that I am, I had a<br/>
couple of questions.<br/>
<br/>
First, I&#39;ve been hunting in South Karana since level 25, hunting the Tesch<br/>
Mas Gnolls around Paw, and perhaps have become a little spoiled, as I have<br/>
been getting great experience killing the yellows and whites, and reaping<br/>
the rewards of the loot. Now, having reached level 30, all of the gnolls are<br/>
now nearing the point where hunting them isn&#39;t beneficial. Could someone<br/>
suggest a similar zone/area with good experience and average to good loot<br/>
where I could hunt fairly safely, either in a group or solo?<br/>
<br/>
Second, Could someone suggest an item for my arm, back, of legs that gives a<br/>
decent (around +3) Wisdom modifer that I could try to track down for myself<br/>
either through a quest or through hunting loot?<br/>
