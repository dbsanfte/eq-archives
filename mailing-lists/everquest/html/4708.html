<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-934170365">You cannot train anything higher than 21 from your guildtrainer. He always<br/>
charges a small fee to train you (this is very minimal if you train from 0<br/>
to 1 and go out and learn the rest on your own.)<br/>
<br/>
However if you choose to train all the way to 21 the pp cost increases and<br/>
this is probably what you did. To any high level character this kind of<br/>
money is peanuts but if its your first level22 character 10pp could actually<br/>
be noticable. <br/>
<br/>
There was always a cost involved spending points, you just never noticed it<br/>
before.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Training Points and Platinum<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi everyone. I just made level 22 last night and when I went to get <br/>
training, I had 10pp in my inventory. When I was finished I didn&#39;t <br/>
have any platinum left. I thought that training used your points that <br/>
you got from leveling and didn&#39;t cost anything? Can someone explain <br/>
why it&#39;s costing to train now?<br/>
<br/>
