 </span></blockquote>This is the main problem I have with both powerleveling and <br/>
twinking.  There are points in the game where your role changes.  I <br/>
have been through 3 of them already.  If you don&#39;t play the lower <br/>
levels of your class you miss a valuable learning experience. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard all of the excuses, it&#39;s boring, I&#39;ve already done it, <br/>
etc.  So, they run an SK up to 30 with PL and Twinking.  They <br/>
figure &quot;I was a Warrior before, now I just have spells too&quot; and then <br/>
get their party killed because they don&#39;t know how to play the SK <br/>
properly.  But that&#39;s everyone elses fault!  Because before their <br/>
protector buffed them up or twinked them out to the point that the <br/>
mobs couldn&#39;t hurt them, so why couldn&#39;t the group?  Then it&#39;s a TPW, <br/>
corpse run and the SK is on the /Ignore list!<br/>
<br/>
I laugh when I see a blueberry run by with a Skeleton chasing them <br/>
because they can&#39;t hurt it, but it can hurt them.  They beg me to <br/>
help them, silly twink.  Go to your well deserved death, I&#39;ll kill <br/>
them mob when it finishes you.  You shouldn&#39;t pick on reds just <br/>
because your daddy gave you Lambant armor to wear!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, maybe I&#39;m bitter too! LOL<br/>
<br/>
But my advice is to enjoy them game and play for every level you <br/>
get.  If some kind soul casts a SoW or other buff on you, thank <br/>
them.  If someone offers you a weapon or armor, thank them.  If you <br/>
beg for these things they may let the Mob kill you, but if your Karma <br/>
is right they may help.  Never expect anything, you&#39;ll never be be <br/>
disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
And remember when you see a newbie struggling that you were there <br/>
once.  <br/>
<br/>
Death to all Twinks! ;)<br/>
