<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149620055">It sure is handy not to have those bears and other animals agro on <br/>
you. I keep to not killing animals more for that than anything else. <br/>
Plus, hq bear pelts are not common drops. Hunt plenty of other stuff, <br/>
I suggest. <br/>

&gt; &gt; If you are roleplaying it would be bad. If the bears con amiably <br/>
to you it<br/>
&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t great for roleplay purposes to hunt them. There dont&#39; seem <br/>
to be any<br/>
&gt; &gt; sort of problems in game terms when you kill them. No <br/>
punishements (can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; think of the right term) for doing it-- unless you get caught by <br/>
an npc<br/>
&gt; &gt; druid and then you&#39;ll get attacked.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, all.  I&#39;m relatively new to the list (been reading it for a <br/>
month or<br/>
&gt; &gt; so, but I&#39;ve never posted before).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my question:  My lvl 10 Druid is currently in EC and I <br/>
desperately<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to start hunting bears, would this be a bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing for a Druid to do?<br/>
