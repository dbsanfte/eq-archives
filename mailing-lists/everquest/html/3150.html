&gt; The easiest place to buy coffins is on the moon, in the bazaar zone. The<br/>
&gt; first merchant next to the bank sells them. He sells both kinds, stackable<br/>
&gt; and non-stackable coffins. I just had to buy a couple yesterday :-( Some<br/>
&gt; guild members do not listen about pushing mobs through the wall, I was<br/>
&gt; tanking a flurry drake in NToV and it got pushed through the wall and it<br/>
&gt; summon myself and 2 others. Since I was bound in bazaar and the corpse&#39;s<br/>
&gt; were now almost to the Plane of Mischief zone, they had to be summoned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, has anyone else been to the PoM zone before? Some card drops are<br/>
&gt; dropped at a ridiculous rate.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to Agree with Erik here.  Each class hass a role to play in<br/>
&gt; any grouping.  Especially when it comes epic Raids.  As one of the<br/>
&gt; premier Sk&#39;s in my guild on Saryn,  I&#39;m needed  in regards to<br/>
&gt; tanking, Fearing on occassion and if we need to go to aplace with<br/>
&gt; alot of undead like the Epic raid to The Hole this past weekend IVU<br/>
&gt; was needed to get to where 2 of the Epic mobs spawned so we didnt<br/>
&gt; have a bunch of casualties. alos using hat Evocation skill is a<br/>
&gt; definate plus when using the Ward Undead line of spells.  Also to a<br/>
&gt; minor degree so far  with FD we can stay at the pull spot and be the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; spy network to give out the all clear if everyone in the group is<br/>
&gt; dead  so the Clerics if they have not zoned or logged can come in<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; rezz folks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Monks are great for pulling when it comes to breaking agro&#39;s.  Using<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FD  9 times out of 10 they can sucessfully  break the agro train so<br/>
&gt; the rest of us can go after one particular mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Clerics obviously are a plus when it comes to heals and rezzes if<br/>
&gt; things go completely awry<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rangers and Druids have that nice tracking ability to let folks know<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; if the objective has spawned or not.  Not to mention the dot&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; snares and roots they have<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Necros  have this nice little spell called summoned corpse. if<br/>
&gt; things<br/>
&gt; get hairy and peeps who were not able to get out in time need to get<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; a rezz and their corpse happens to be deep into the zone with a<br/>
&gt; gazillion mobs between the zoneline and their corpse (CT, ToFS, The<br/>
&gt; Hole, Befallen are prime examples) If the prson  manages to make it<br/>
&gt; back tot he zone nekked then the necro can target the PC and summon<br/>
&gt; the corpse.  admittedly Sk have the lesser summon corpse spell but<br/>
&gt; ihave not used it yet and still can&#39;t find whre Ineed to get the<br/>
&gt; coffin Ineed for that spell seeing as Neriak still doenst have them<br/>
&gt; hehe I may ned to go into Paineel for it.  Plus necros can fear cast<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IVU and also have other nice damaging spells at teir disposal.  and<br/>
&gt; DMF is to die for when you need to swim to someplace and you dont<br/>
&gt; have  a good  underwater spell not to mentionletting you see invis<br/>
&gt; and float at the same time<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shamans have a lot of nice spells to cast on peeps and some can be<br/>
&gt; stacked with other peeps buffs.  not to mention they have some nice<br/>
&gt; dot&#39;s  and back up roots  if the Druids are unable to root.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pallies make great tanks as well as back up healers and at higher<br/>
&gt; levels can do  limited rezes. buffs are of the lower end Cleric line<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; but if no cleric is around for heal&#39;s buffs and rezzes, are you<br/>
&gt; gonna<br/>
&gt; complain? I ain&#39;t cause a pally buff/heal could mean the difference<br/>
&gt; between life and death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chanter&#39;s have ths nice mezz line of spells as well as charm.  Ever<br/>
&gt; been to a raid or in group where you have a couple of mobs on your<br/>
&gt; rear end and you happen to see a mob fighitng another mob?  Thank<br/>
&gt; that Chanter for that.  And their  Clarity line of spells are a<br/>
&gt; godsend for  all of us mana users<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Speaking of Meddings and such dont forgett eh bards with their mana<br/>
&gt; song that goes quite well in conjuntion with Clarity.  also their<br/>
&gt; Regen song goes great in conjunction with  some of teh Regen spells<br/>
&gt; some peeps (shammy  comes to mind right off the bat) have<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then you have the Rogues.  Not only do they tank well but they also<br/>
&gt; have this nice  backstab ability that can do some serious damage to<br/>
&gt; the mob giving that nice death from behind effect<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mages and Wizards have some great nuke spells that come quite handy<br/>
&gt; when an especially difficult mob is encountered and the pally lay on<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hands is used up the sk harm touch is used up and your healers are<br/>
&gt; oom<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And last but not least oyu have the Warrior.  The premier Tank<br/>
&gt; class.  You need a tanks to help take down a mob call a warrior.<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; only do they hit hard but the can do some nice crits as well as kick<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; harder than a mule and igf I remember correctly they can duel wield<br/>
&gt; and double attack thus making them a force to be reckoned with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My apologies if I did not mention the Beastlord.  I have not come<br/>
&gt; across one yet at the time of this writing so i have very little<br/>
&gt; (read as none =()information as to how they fit in the scheme of<br/>
&gt; things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All of the above of course is based on my personal encounters with<br/>
&gt; each of these classes.  Whether my encounter be in group or based on<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the chars I have of a particular class.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is the kinda thing that gives people the wrong impression<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; classes.  Shaman are extremely important to a raid, from slowing a<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; mob to<br/>
&gt; &gt; giving melee some excellent stat buffs.  High level Rangers put<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; obscene<br/>
&gt; &gt; amounts of damage and are able to tank mobs that aggro on casters,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; &gt; being about to almost immedialely reduce aggro when needed.  Mages<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; excellent for mana regen (mod rods) and CotH.  Druids are<br/>
&gt; excellent<br/>
&gt; &gt; secondary healers on raid, throwing in heals between CHs.  Monks<br/>
&gt; and SK&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; are excellent indoor pullers (breaking Fear is terribly hard<br/>
&gt; without a Monk<br/>
&gt; &gt; or SK to scout).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There really isn&#39;t one single class that is not needed in a raid<br/>
&gt; situation.<br/>
