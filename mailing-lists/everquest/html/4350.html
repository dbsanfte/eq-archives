<div id="ygrps-yiv-376238259">Threetoed Treetoad... that&#39;s a clever name! Sounds good, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Edward... I&#39;m glad you figured everything out. It takes some time getting <br/>
use to the game and getting to know all of the buttons and comands, but you <br/>
will catch on. If you ever need any help, just shout for it using either <br/>
/shout or /ooc and most of the time someone in the zone will be able to help <br/>
you out. When I first started, I remember I was a wreck. I thought I would <br/>
never learn everything there was to know, but I did, and you will too. Good <br/>
luck and have fun!<br/>
