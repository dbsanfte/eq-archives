&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why must you continue this argument.. Maybe you do have 22 years of<br/>
&gt; experience playing RPGss.. can you name any where you can give your<br/>
&gt; character&#39;s equipment, to another one of your characters? Or do you<br/>
&gt; have to restart with a new character - most only allow you to maintain<br/>
&gt; one character.  If anything you are flaming me.  I clearly stated that<br/>
&gt; your request for info on the stein is no big deal.. infact I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; care if someone gives it to your or not.. and as far as you trying to<br/>
&gt; bring shame to my name KALE, if that is your real name, by posting my<br/>
&gt; personal message to you.  Whose the one who has a problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW my other character is a Level 16 Dark Elf Necromancer.. where do<br/>
&gt; you have any room to telling me your problems. Stating my case:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  I didn&#39;t have a problem with you, if you would reread the<br/>
&gt; message.  I simply had posted a rant about Twinkies, maybe you took it<br/>
&gt; personally don&#39;t cry over it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  Can you legitably transfer one of your characters equipment to<br/>
&gt; another, in any of those other games you mention.  Everquest blesses<br/>
&gt; us with the ablity to have more than one character, for flexibility<br/>
&gt; not for exploitation.  If you choose not to be a legitimate player,<br/>
&gt; forgive my attempt to maintain some integrity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  Obviously if you feel offended by anything contained in this or<br/>
&gt; the other message, its perfectly clear to me and to others:  you feel<br/>
&gt; that what you are doing, if you are doing it, is wrong and you take<br/>
&gt; the observation personally as an attack.  I think someone might have a<br/>
&gt; problem with their conscience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Finally, and I hope its final...  its just a game, if you feel that<br/>
&gt; you are handicapped by playing the game as it was designed ( EQ<br/>
&gt; designers have always had concerns about players that maintain mule<br/>
&gt; accounts, and look to ways of hindering users from using them ) maybe<br/>
&gt; you should submit an email to them, letting them know you want them to<br/>
&gt; include an interface so you can pass equipment between your<br/>
&gt; characters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And remember Smile :)  I only state facts, I don&#39;t pour out my<br/>
&gt; emotions to make people feel sorry for me.  Please, please don&#39;t post<br/>
&gt; messages here unless you originated the message, if it was meant for<br/>
&gt; everyone I would have posted it so everyone can see.  But I do forgive<br/>
&gt; you for your slander.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes I ponder this.  Why to people just give things away to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;people. Let them work for it, or at least pay for it.<br/>
&gt; Especially<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;when the person receiving it has no idea where it came from.<br/>
&gt; Its<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;funny and sad really, when your in the newbie yard and you see<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;level 2 player chasing a snake around in full bronze armor.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Crude Stein is no big deal, but if someone wants to give &gt;&gt;&gt;you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;something that is significant don&#39;t accept it.  Add a little<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;character to your character, so to speak. Get down in the<br/>
&gt; trenches<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with the rest of us, in the long run it will make you a better<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;player.  Some call it twinking, I call them Twinkies.. looks<br/>
&gt; good<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;yet not much substance. :) hehe<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;          Anyways...   have fun... hehe          Duhase - Veeshan<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is this guy like rude or what? I just asked for verification of info,<br/>
&gt; or a<br/>
&gt; possible in game trade/sale which occurs on a regular basis. Does<br/>
&gt; anyone<br/>
&gt; give merchants a hard time in the game? I think not. Nor do I think<br/>
&gt; players<br/>
&gt; give other players a hard time when they come upon something they<br/>
&gt; think is<br/>
&gt; worth selling. He then labels those who do such things as &quot;twinks&quot;. I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; over 22 years of roleplaying (MUD&#39;s, MUCK&#39;s, MUSH&#39;s, RPG&#39;s, CRPG&#39;s),<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; name it, I&#39;ve probably played it, and in my books, thems fighting<br/>
&gt; words bub!<br/>
&gt; His response, to which I replied the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;For your information, I&#39;m a level 10 Dark Elf Shadow Knight and am<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;down in the trenches. An item like this doesn&#39;t just grow on<br/>
&gt; trees,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and I know it. And another thing, just because I know where to<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;an item, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll be able to walk in and just get it.<br/>
&gt; It<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;has to be earned. Name one thing in EQ that doesn&#39;t have to be<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;earned? SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.... before you go calling someone a<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;twink and make comments like that, I suggest you get all your<br/>
&gt; facts<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;straight before you offend someone..... like you just did.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He then replies:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Like i really care if i hurt your feelings..  Big deal  i have 2<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;characters that are lvl 16 and growing. Neither one is twinked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe the game<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;is too hard for you, well some people can handle a little pressure<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;some cant. Big Deal.  Earn it.  Btw are you twinked..  Guess<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;it still takes the same amount of time to get thru the levels..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;just dont sweat it and keep playing.  If you read my email i<br/>
&gt; stated<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that the Stein i hadno problem with..<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Seeya :)  and remember its only a game<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lance<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you ask me, I&#39;m not the one with the problem here, and I can think<br/>
&gt; of a<br/>
&gt; billion different ways to rationalize off what you call twinking<br/>
&gt; LANCE. And<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;re going to start flaming and calling someone something they<br/>
&gt; consider<br/>
&gt; rude and offensive LANCE, you better be ready to deal with the<br/>
&gt; consequences.<br/>
&gt; And just for your info, my character is hardly twinked. Every little<br/>
&gt; copper<br/>
&gt; I have, I earned by starting a level one character with just the basic<br/>
&gt; items<br/>
&gt; on his back that you start with. And if you think playing a Dark Elf<br/>
&gt; Shadow<br/>
&gt; Knight is so easy, I suggest you try doing so. Just about every NPC<br/>
&gt; (except<br/>
&gt; those in Neriak) attack you on sight or won&#39;t sell equipment to you.<br/>
&gt; As for<br/>
&gt; handling pressure LANCE, I have 6 years in the military. You don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; more pressure than that. So who needs to learn about pressure here?<br/>
&gt; Not me.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d look closer to home. And while you&#39;re at it, next time I suggest<br/>
&gt; using a<br/>
&gt; thesarus and dictionary. Your spelling and grammar are terrible LANCE.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of you out there who consider this spam, my apologies (but<br/>
&gt; if the<br/>
&gt; shoe fits, wear it). I just can&#39;t stand people who go off half cocked<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; something when they no as to what they&#39;re talking about.<br/>
