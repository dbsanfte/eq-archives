&gt; It&#39;s not that bad.  Once you figure out where the zone-in is, it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; really that big of a deal.  The Orcs in the fort don&#39;t see invis, so you<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t in any danger unless it drops.  And at 36 you have SoW, so even if<br/>
&gt; invis did drop, you can outrun them to the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree here. You can NOT outrun them even with sow because the rygors<br/>
seem to have sow already. And they stun you and hit for 150dmg or more at a<br/>
time. They killed my lvl 50 cleric (who had sow on) in 2 seconds while he<br/>
was trying to outrun them. He was full life and fully buffed at the time he<br/>
tried to outrun them. and they took him down that fast. Don&#39;t know how many,<br/>
but they were all behind him. none were in front so he didnt&#39; run by any.<br/>
They just caught up. No noticeable lag. I have been killed several times at<br/>
this fort because the mobs outrun sow even when you are full life. And they<br/>
often interrupt gate.<br/>
But, with camo up it is safe to enter the fort. Safer even if a group has<br/>
killed most of the orcs at the fort.<br/>

&gt; The ent of CC is safe.  I never saw a train when I was in there (well a<br/>
&gt; train at the EW zone in anyway).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have seen numerous trains. the green conning orcs will aggro and gang up.<br/>
people train to the guards inside.<br/>

&gt; Crystalline silk, which is the other component.   Even with the &quot;Nexus<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup. Very sweet loot in CC. Also dropped are crystalline fiber, messenger of<br/>
the queen, ccs, and other goodies.<br/>
