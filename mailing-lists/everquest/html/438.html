<div id="ygrps-yiv-421529348">In my experience on The Rathe, the only level 2 players you will see in full bronze got that full bronze from one of their older siblings, who DID it the hard way to begin with...worked their way up the ladder until they were high enough to acquire such good items.  I currently have only one persona in EQ...a cleric who is almost level 40 now.  She acquired her exp and items the hard way...fighting and dying for them, saving enough plat to buy them, camping for hours and days on end for them, and trading some of them for others.  I have all my banded from my early days and some other nice things vaulted...I did not sell them.  Why? Because when my current persona DOES get a sibling, you can bet that is whom they are going to go to. A Twinkie? Yah, you betcha.  But don&#39;t forget....they were originally gotten the long, hard way.  <br/>
<br/>
Been there...done that....not gonna do it again.<br/>

    Sometimes I ponder this.  Why to people just give things away to people. Let them work for it, or at least pay for it.  Especially when the person receiving it has no idea where it came from.  Its funny and sad really, when your in the newbie yard and you see a level 2 player chasing a snake around in full bronze armor.  The Crude Stein is no big deal, but if someone wants to give you something that is significant don&#39;t accept it.  Add a little character to your character, so to speak. Get down in the trenches with the rest of us, in the long run it will make you a better player.  Some call it twinking, I call them Twinkies..  looks good yet not much substance. :) hehe<br/>
<br/>
    Anyways...   have fun... hehe <br/>
