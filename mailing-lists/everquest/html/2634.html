  items and spawns?</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>&gt;I guess I should go to Alakhazam and even pay the 
  subscription fee to find<br>out some good stuff to &gt;camp/quests to do, 
  etc.<br>&gt;<br>Actually, there are some features there that are still free. 
  And there are<br>guides for specific classes on other sights I 
  think.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I guess you decide upon a target and then spend a 
  ridiculous amount of time<br>waiting for it to show 
  up.<br>&gt;<br>Yup.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Like a classic target is Grenix Mucktail, 
  who drops the Polished Granite<br>Tomahawk. I suppose in order to &gt;camp the 
  PGT you just keep killing all the<br>gnolls in the area that Grenix spawns 
  until he does and then you kill &gt;him<br>and get the Tomahawk. I don&#39;t think 
  that is very productive for a level 30<br>ranger to do, but it would be 
  &gt;good practice. I suppose you would make some<br>money from the items the 
  gnolls dropped as well. Maybe I &gt;will camp the orcs<br>on the other side to 
  see if that guy who drops the weight reduction bag<br>shows up.<br>&gt;<br>The 
  PGT isn&#39;t that hard to get. I got it and the cracked darkwood shield a<br>few 
  times. It&#39;s more fun if you are in a gnoll killing group for xp 
  or<br>faction.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;It seems like an enchanter is a better character 
  for getting into groups<br>and being invited on epic encounters, but &gt;a 
  ranger is better for doing<br>quests and camping items.<br>&gt;<br>Since my 
  mains are a cleric and a wizard, I wouldn&#39;t 
  know.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br></tt><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at
