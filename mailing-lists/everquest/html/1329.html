<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105829362">Heh I do that too with my new guild :&gt;<br/>
Lords of the Fallen<br/>
<br/>
currently we&#39;re a low level guild on the Bert server.  But with high<br/>
ambitions.  I don&#39;t think adversely to giving others armor you don&#39;t need<br/>
anymore.<br/>
Heh I gave a low level SK lizzie some armor just cause he was a guild member<br/>
and I didn&#39;t need it...<br/>
<br/>
Heh...he felt bad cause he couldn&#39;t pay for it :&gt;<br/>

&gt; Subject:	Re: [EverQuest] About loot order<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are some really nice people I&#39;ve encountered. i started a Rogue a<br/>
&gt; few<br/>
&gt; days ago. i was determined to not have her twinked. I&#39;m running around<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; no armor and just the weapon I started with... I got to lvl 2 just turning<br/>
&gt; in bardic mail without having to kill anything. Then some guy walks up and<br/>
&gt; hands me 2pp. I reluctantly took it. Then another guy came up and gave me<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; Shiny Brass Shield. At first I tried to refuse but then figured I could<br/>
&gt; give<br/>
&gt; it to one of my mom&#39;s alts. Then some guy started offering me splitpaw<br/>
&gt; armor. I tried to pay him for it but he wouldn&#39;t let me. So I ended up<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; all this stuff by lvl 3... The gnoll hide lariat rules though. I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; complain.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
