&gt; that sounds dangerous.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not that bad.  Once you figure out where the zone-in is, it&#39;s not<br/>
really that big of a deal.  The Orcs in the fort don&#39;t see invis, so you<br/>
aren&#39;t in any danger unless it drops.  And at 36 you have SoW, so even if<br/>
invis did drop, you can outrun them to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
The ent of CC is safe.  I never saw a train when I was in there (well a<br/>
train at the EW zone in anyway).<br/>
<br/>
The Orcs drop some nice items and velium, which is one of the components to<br/>
making Thurg Gate potions.  The spiders at the bottom of the Caverns drop<br/>
Crystalline silk, which is the other component.   Even with the &quot;Nexus<br/>
porting system&quot;, the gate potions are essential, especially as you get up in<br/>
level and start doing raids.</div>
