<div id="ygrps-yiv-637737004"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; By the way I did defrag(and needed it) but to no avail.<br/>
&gt; My big question is why can&#39;t I post at the station? I have cookies <br/>
&gt; enabled, I&#39;m signed in and it says &quot;hi muddywag&quot; at the top, but it <br/>
&gt; keeps telling me that I need to be registered.  AHHH! IWANNA KILL A <br/>
&gt; BAT!!  By the way I CAN play the tutorial.  Which only served to let <br/>
&gt; me know that I&#39;ll REALLY like this game- someday!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t post to the tech boards because you don&#39;t have an EQ account <br/>
yet.  Until you finish the registration screens in the game your station <br/>
name and password isn&#39;t associated with an EQ account.<br/>
Do yourself a favor and delete that tutorial.  If it&#39;s the one you <br/>
download off the station&#39;s website, it&#39;s very old.  It does give an idea <br/>
of gameplay but you&#39;ll still be very lost when you play for the first <br/>
time.<br/>
First thing you do when you do get a character started is change where <br/>
the autoattack key is.  Every newbie gets killed trying to talk to thier <br/>
trainer because they don&#39;t hit enter before they start to type<br/>
You click Options then Keyboard then click the field below Autoattack <br/>
then hit a key on the keyboard you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll use often.  Mine <br/>
is set to Q, some people use the Insert key.  Dont use the numbers, <br/>
anything on the number pad, Pgup, Pgdown, or any of the Fkeys or arrow <br/>
key; all those have a use already in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
