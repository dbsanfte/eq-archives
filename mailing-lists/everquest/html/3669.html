<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250582819">No offense but how do you know this? Of course they aren&#39;t going to put<br/>
that kind of info on there, they probably would consider that a<br/>
&quot;spoiler&quot;. I think the book would be handy for like off-line research<br/>
and maybe the new RPG coming out. EQ Atlas is still an excellent source,<br/>
maybe this book is Verant&#39;s answer to several requests for maps from<br/>
them. As you said, part of the point of the game is exploring, what good<br/>
would it be to have that info on the map, you&#39;ll know exactly where you<br/>
need to go and never &quot;explore&quot;. <br/>

Don&#39;t forget that Part of the point of the game is exploring.  People<br/>
shouldn&#39;t know every little detail of a zone they have not been in<br/>
before.  <br/>
I do know that the atlas that verant is putting out is not nearly as<br/>
detailed as the maps done by EQ atlas.  It will be a topographical map<br/>
and nothing more.  No landmarks, no points of interest.  There will be<br/>
no info about what mobs are in the zone etc.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I will stick with EQ atlas for now, the maps are detailed<br/>
enough that I don&#39;t get lost (usually) and I can usually find what I am<br/>
looking for after adventuring for a little bit =D<br/>
