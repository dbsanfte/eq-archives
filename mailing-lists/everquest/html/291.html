<br/>
One of the best hunting grounds for 2nd through 5th lvl characters is the <br/>
Barbarian region of Everfrost Peaks near town of Halas.  This area has hordes <br/>
of mobs that give good experience points and probably the best loot found on <br/>
low lvl mobs including cracked staffs, backpacks, pelts, bags and weapons as <br/>
well as silver.  When starting a new character, I highly recommend making the <br/>
trip to Everfrost Peaks for early leveling.</div>
