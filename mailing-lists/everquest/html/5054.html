<b>Subject:</b> I lust for more power- <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129698049">My son saved his penneys, and bought an Alien Area 51, and subscribed<br/>
to DSL. I played for the first time on his computer the other night.<br/>
Techno-envey and power lust have me big time. I still limp along on a<br/>
nearly three year old etower 600mh rig with limited memory and graphics.<br/>
<br/>
To cruise the Bazaar with hardly a hitch. To visit POK and be able to<br/>
move in a normal fashion. Ah. <br/>
<br/>
The good news is we work different schedules with different days off.<br/>
Since we (gasp) share an account, we can&#39;t play at the same time,<br/>
anyway. So, on my days off I borrow his system and live the EQ life<br/>
the way it was intended to be lived.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise I play Gamecube. Almost done with Windwaker. Stalled in<br/>
Metroid Prime; gotta get in there and try harder. And I actually play<br/>
Animal Crossing every day. That would be so uncool if the game weren&#39;t<br/>
so well designed and balanced. You can&#39;t kill anything, but I<br/>
surrounded Bill&#39;s house with pitfalls. How&#39;s that for evil AC?<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate the gaming community here. You all enhance my<br/>
gaming experience.<br/>
