<div id="ygrps-yiv-967942252">Ok, so how many male chars are played by women???<br/>
<br/>
This would be funny. Knowing a male char is Female in<br/>
person and saying out of context.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hey Regal, you are looking good sweetie?&quot;<br/>
NOTE: this should be said in a crowded place like the<br/>
EC tunnel........<br/>
<br/>
Boy would that draw attention...... lol<br/>
<br/>
ENJOY!<br/>

&gt;   Not sure how true this is but it would be exciting<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   know that it is true.  Have been playing another<br/>
&gt; game<br/>
&gt;   (my bad) where i would have to say the majority of<br/>
&gt;   female characters ARE played by men...<br/>

&gt;   &gt; characters played by women, is there any truth<br/>

&gt;   &gt; this, or did I just not care in the past and<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
