<div id="ygrps-yiv-658251317">Bronze plate, in addition to being extremely heavy, does not<br/>
absorb damage as well as normal plate.<br/>
<br/>
On the heaviness side - 86lb may not seem like much, until<br/>
you factor in that you will be carrying at least 10LB of weapons,<br/>
4LB of backpacks, several LB of food and drink, every 40 coins<br/>
weighs 1B. A full suit really isn&#39;t feasible for anything weaker than<br/>
a troll or ogre.<br/>

Heyas all,<br/>
<br/>
I recently was playing my Troll Shadow Knight (my highest character at<br/>
level<br/>
10 =) and was exploring the Rathe Mountains when I happened upon 3 tents<br/>
each with an Ogre or Troll NPC vendor at each one. I checked the first one,<br/>
it was your usual inn-type shop. Went to the second one, a stock of leather<br/>
armor. Ok then, I check the third, and apparently some player had dumped a<br/>
suit of Bronze Armor on it. So, I check it&#39;s stats and quickly learn that<br/>
<br/>
#1. It&#39;s much heavier than plate<br/>
#2. It&#39;s the same AC as plate<br/>
<br/>
So I go to check the prices, expecting the usual 5800+ platinum plate<br/>
costs.<br/>
After doing a near double-take, I realize the total cost for the set is 210<br/>
platinum. So, I quickly run my Troll hide to Oggok and grabwhat little plat<br/>
I had (36 or so) and bought the Tunic and Collar/Gorget.<br/>
<br/>
So, getting to my question, this stuff may be much heavier, but a 5600 plat<br/>
priceslash for weight? What&#39;s the deal on that? Since I couldn&#39;t afford a<br/>
full suit now, I was interested in picking some up, and was told I could do<br/>
so in HighPass Hold. Where in HighPass can I find it and on what<br/>
monster(s)?<br/>
And was this price a fluke, or is this the going rate? If so, why would<br/>
anybody ever buy Normal Plate? I do realize a full suit (and I added it<br/>
together) weighs about 86 pounds, which is quite hefty, is that the only<br/>
reason it is so much cheaper?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch,<br/>
