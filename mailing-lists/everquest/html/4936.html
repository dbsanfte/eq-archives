<div id="ygrps-yiv-847935709">Thanks for the info/responds... This was really worrying me. I <br/>
believe in playing fair no matter what. It&#39;s only a game to me , one <br/>
I really enjoy but still only a game. so..........Besides CP where <br/>
would I go to hunt and group to level up a 24th level Shaman? ( I <br/>
really would like to start makeing those potions at 25th level) I <br/>
level slow because I don&#39;t play but an hour or so at a time but I am <br/>
getting there..<br/>
 I am on the server that starts with an X (the longer name not the 3 <br/>
leter one).. this shows you how much I play , I don&#39;t even know the <br/>
name of the server I am on...lol<br/>
<br/>
In service..<br/>
