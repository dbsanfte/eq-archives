<div id="ygrps-yiv-906658106">Also a note on this: the giants in FM do see through invis and sneak doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to work on them.<br/>
A druid led me into the giant fort trying to find the body of a friend I was<br/>
trying to rez. I tried to tell him that the giants saw thru invis. But he<br/>
didn&#39;t listen. Next thing I knew the entire fort was aggrod on us. He went<br/>
down and rather than train the fort onto the people outside, I gated out. It<br/>
pretty much sucked.<br/>

kite animals or bow kite. I agree about Frontier &gt;Moutains, it&#39;s too<br/>
dangerous to solo there. Unless you can find a good place to pull to you<br/>

  &gt; My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings toward<br/>
  game<br/>
  &gt; death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s attitudes<br/>
  &gt; toward game death?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on<br/>
  &gt; since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in<br/>
  &gt; awkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t<br/>
  just<br/>
  &gt; call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor<br/>
  do<br/>
  &gt; have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big<br/>
  &gt; nasty.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the<br/>
  &gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all<br/>
  &gt; that.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server. He<br/>
  &gt; is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and tactics<br/>
  &gt; and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the<br/>
  &gt; Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but<br/>
  enjoy<br/>
  &gt; my independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career as<br/>
  &gt; possible.<br/>

  Death is something I try to avoid.  I made Locate and Corpse hotkeys<br/>
  early on for corpse runs.  But I hate the XP loss.  I died 3 times<br/>
  last week, which added another 2 days before I reached 38.  I have no<br/>
  guild or high level friends to depend either, so I go where I know I<br/>
  can get back to.  But I do have a Druid cousin that jumps me around<br/>
  when he&#39;s on.  So spend a few minutes scouting before you jump in!<br/>
  Learn from your mistakes!<br/>
<br/>
  Once you get to Kunark your solo career is limited.  There are just<br/>
  too many mob&#39;s and too big a chance of a bad pull.  I have seen<br/>
  Druids quadkiting in the OT and I saw one go down on an overpull.  It<br/>
  helps to group until you get a feel for the area.  And watch out for<br/>
  the Goons in OT!<br/>
