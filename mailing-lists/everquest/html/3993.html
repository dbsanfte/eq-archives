<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for bringing up that 
point.&nbsp; I just saw an artical in the Gamepro magazine on Everquest online 
adventures.&nbsp; Is Sony going to get us to change to that instead of playing 
it on the computer?&nbsp; I dhave a ps2 but I don&#39;t want to pay for the network 
adapter the game and the service price to play the game.&nbsp; I like EQ for the 
computer and that is how I am going to stay.</font></div></html></div>
