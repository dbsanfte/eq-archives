<div id="ygrps-yiv-695602222">At level 10, if you can not get one hit in for ONE point before the damage<br/>
shield kills the mobs, you might want to stop trying to kill the dark reds<br/>
and stick with black and yellow cons. Damage shields is one of the better<br/>
tools for power leveling.<br/>

	I am not too crazy about using damage shields on very low level<br/>
players to<br/>
	help them power-level, because the newbie mobs often kill themselves<br/>
on the<br/>
	damage shields before you can even get in one damage point. When<br/>
soloing,<br/>
	you have to inflict at least one damage on a mob to get exp. for<br/>
killing it.<br/>
<br/>
	I know I always hated it when a well-meaning druid would cast Shield<br/>
of<br/>
	Spikes or whatever on my newbie characters. Gray wolf, orc pawn,<br/>
fire<br/>
	beetle, bat, goblin whelp etc. -- attack, bingo dead time after time<br/>
without<br/>
	me getting exp for it.<br/>
<br/>
	Skin and regen is much more helpful, as well as standing by and<br/>
healing at<br/>
	need.<br/>
<br/>
	My opinion only =)<br/>

	&gt; Well, I don&#39;t know much about melee myself either but I can say<br/>
that<br/>
	&gt; you can DS (Damage Shield) your hubby to power level him as well<br/>
as<br/>
	&gt; give him Skin Like Rock.  Also, buff him up with strength so he<br/>
can<br/>
	&gt; deal more damage.  I&#39;m really not sure if fearing is very<br/>
effective<br/>
	&gt; to PL because when I tried doing that, they didn&#39;t seem to get<br/>
much<br/>
	&gt; xp out of it.  Well, I can definitely help your hubby get to your<br/>
	&gt; level if you&#39;re on Vazaelle.  I doubt it though.  Not many poeple<br/>
	&gt; I&#39;ve seen online post that they&#39;re on vazaelle.  Cuz I can<br/>
definitely<br/>
	&gt; help him level.  I&#39;m a level 51 druid and I can use my 49 DS and<br/>
	&gt; he&#39;ll kill mobs like they were nothing.  It deals 24 points of<br/>
damage<br/>
	&gt; each time the mob hits the person with the DS.<br/>

	&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
	&gt; &gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt; I was wondering if some of you could help me.  I got my hubby<br/>
	&gt; involved in EQ<br/>
	&gt; &gt; so he&#39;d stop bugging me to get off the computer.  He&#39;s got a<br/>
10th<br/>
	&gt; lvl<br/>
	&gt; &gt; halfling fighter, and I know next to nothing about the melee<br/>
	&gt; classes.<br/>
	&gt; &gt; Assuming he&#39;s got about 1000pp to spend, what are his best<br/>
choices<br/>
	&gt; for armor<br/>
	&gt; &gt; and a decent weapon.  He&#39;s got a fine steel longsword right now,<br/>
	&gt; which seems<br/>
	&gt; &gt; to suck, and leather armor.  Should he go to bronze or fine<br/>
steel<br/>
	&gt; armor?<br/>
	&gt; &gt; What does a full suit of either of these cost?  And what&#39;s the<br/>
best<br/>
	&gt; weapon<br/>
	&gt; &gt; for him at this point?<br/>
	&gt; &gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt; Also, I&#39;m trying to powerlevel him just a little so we can go<br/>
	&gt; adventuring<br/>
	&gt; &gt; together, though I&#39;m not generally a fan of leveling people that<br/>
	&gt; don&#39;t know<br/>
	&gt; &gt; what they&#39;re doing.  They should die plenty and learn like the<br/>
rest<br/>
	&gt; of us<br/>
	&gt; &gt; did :P  I have a 16 druid and he just needs a couple of levels<br/>
so<br/>
	&gt; we can<br/>
	&gt; &gt; hang out.  Is there a good place to do this quickly?  All I can<br/>
	&gt; think of at<br/>
	&gt; &gt; the moment is to fear kite lions and bears, oh my, and let him<br/>
hack<br/>
	&gt; them up.<br/>
	&gt; &gt; There&#39;s so darn many people in EC these days, though.<br/>
	&gt; &gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt; Thanks for any help!!<br/>
