<div id="ygrps-yiv-398832595">In my original post I might not of made it clear I do not go around<br/>
inspecting others but I read about how others have allot of money and was<br/>
unsure how they did this. I do not like to twink my characters I think the<br/>
fun is in earning what you get not being given to you by others. So I was<br/>
just interested in how others made $ in EQ(i.e.. selling things, helping<br/>
higher level PC, etc...)  It has been nice to see others in the same<br/>
position thanks for  the responses<br/>

ROFLMBO!!!!  I don&#39;t go around inspecting anyone.  This level 6 inspected me<br/>
<br/>
and then told me to inspect him.  I don&#39;t pay attention to others.  I guess <br/>
this person wanted to show me what his rich uncle gave him.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
any <br/>
16 year olds driving a BMW.  I live in the country.  You don&#39;t see many BMWs<br/>
<br/>
out here.  I&#39;m not in for a sad EQ life.  I enjoy it very much thank you.   <br/>
I&#39;m not in it for an uber character.  I play to have fun.  I am not <br/>
anti-twinkage.  My husband has a couple high characters on another account.<br/>
<br/>
So I could twink my enchanter out outrageously.  I choose to do it wisely. <br/>

If you go around inspecting lower level players, you are going to find A LOT<br/>
<br/>
of people with great gear better than yours. I guess you&#39;re in for a sad EQ <br/>
life, or atleast until you understand this and get over your sadness or you <br/>
obtain some great gear for yourself. <br/>
<br/>
Buy low, sell high and go buy your own uber gear.    <br/>
