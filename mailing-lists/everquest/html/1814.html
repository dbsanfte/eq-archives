  <div><br></div><tt>I have a 40 druid and have a lot of friends that have alts 
  (in other words I <br>power lvl ppl a lot lol) .....my normal way to go is to 
  take then to a level <br>appropriate area (since I&#39;m high enough, I generally 
  take then to oasis - i <br>can keep them alive there) then sow skin str and ds 
  them....then heal when <br>needed....for a change I won&#39;t ds them, rather I 
  let them hit the monster <br>down to half hps then take it out myself (don&#39;t 
  ds and then kill it yourself <br>- they won&#39;t get exp)<br><br>But since oasis 
  is also still dangerous to you, I&#39;d stay in ec....anything <br>that is blue to 
  you, have him whack at and that should work.<br><br>As for armor....a suit of 
  fs on Drinal costs about 1500pp, bronze is much <br>less, so that might work 
  better....You might hang around nfp and auc for <br>good warrior armor for the 
  money you have, some ppl just want to get rid of <br>stuff and sell for super 
  cheap or are quitting the game and getting rid of <br>everything on 
  them....<br><br>I have a 23 warrior, and my druid recently was widowed (he 
  quit the game) <br>and I had 2 really nice wedding rings....so I sold them and 
  hung around nfp <br>for a while, and managed to get a full suit of crafted 
  (warrior specific <br>quest armor) minus the helm for 1200 - quite a lot less 
  then the going price <br>on my server....<br><br>sorry off the subject there 
  had to brag :)<br><br>And as for a weapon, my warrior has icetooth claws 
  (11/29) and a giant <br>militia longsword (11/39) but she started out with 
  kodiak claws (I think <br>7/30) and a langseax (I think 6/28) The giant 
  militia longsword is about <br>80pp on my server, but the icetooths are a 
  couple hundred *I think* they <br>were a gift.....<br><br>I hope this helps 
  somewhat :)<br><br>Synthea Firestorm<br>L40 Druidess<br>Sirens of the Storm -
