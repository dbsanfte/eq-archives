<div><font face="Arial" size="2">For the most part, that&#39;s not really necessary any 
more.&nbsp; I agree the ghost thing is cool in WoW.&nbsp; It&#39;s fun to explore 
the world like that.&nbsp; But in EQ, now it&#39;s not really necessary to try and 
make it back to your corpse.&nbsp; Since Dragons of Norrath introduced the Guild 
Lobby and Guild Hall you can go to a corpse summoner in he lobby and summon your 
corpse from anywhere in the game for a small price ((comparatively 
speaking)).&nbsp; I think its like 200pp for a 60+ summon.&nbsp; There are 
usually people on hand in the lobby that can rez you.&nbsp; Also, thre&#39;s 
Shadowrest which is accessible from POK.&nbsp; you can go there and have your 
corpse summoned as well.&nbsp; Take someone with you to rez you.&nbsp; Sometimes 
its better than trying to get back to your corpse without gear.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>I&#39;m still considering getting the expansion but am not 
  sure. It takes me 10 minutes to login and 2 to 5 minutes to zone..<br>I really 
  wish they could do what Warcraft does and make it not take so long when you 
  die. I really do like the spawning at a graveyard nearby in ghost thing in 
  warcraft. Although sometimes it can be annoying. It beats having to wait all 
  that time to zone and then trying to get back to your corpse with no 
  gear.<br>Thanks for the info!<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>======= At 2005-11-03,

  mechanical mount looks like the war piggies in Plane of Tactics.&nbsp; They 
  had a big problem with people doing the monser missions.&nbsp; They were too 
  easy and people were soloing them for AA xp.&nbsp; They&#39;ve nerfed them a bit 
  now.&nbsp; And now it&#39;s like watching paint dry.&nbsp; they don&#39;t mvoe very 
  quickly, and I&#39;m wondering if the amount of xp is worth the effort.&nbsp; 
  Still, some of the drops are really decent.&nbsp; Frankly, I think Dragons of 
  Norrath was a better expansion pack.&nbsp; They have overhauled the UI 
  somewhat.&nbsp; Now you&#39;ve got 4 hotkey bars: 2 horizontal, and 2 
  vertical.&nbsp; You can customize all 4 of them in the Options window.&nbsp; A 
  lot of people say it looks a lot like EQ2 now, but I dont think so.&nbsp; It 
  basically looks similar to what it was, just more colors to contrast some of 
  the data.&nbsp; Yadda
