<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613188697">Heh heh not to brag or anything but I have no lag in the Bazaar..gotta love<br/>
DSL...I don&#39;t really remember the hardware stats on my PC but it has top of<br/>
the line stuff as of November 02 and I love it.  My friend made it for me<br/>
and it cost me just about $1600.  I have 1Gigabyte of RAM and THX Surround<br/>
Sound Speakers (I love the subwoofer) and my case is all black alliumun<br/>
(excuse my spelling) and it has a blue light inside the see-thru case that<br/>
is sound activated so whenever you make noise or play music it flashes.  The<br/>
front of my case has this twin lava lamp sotra thing that goes from blue,<br/>
green, and red.  My mouse is see thru optical with a blue light and my whole<br/>
computer is all black and my moniter is a 15 inch flat screen.  Heh I only<br/>
got one of those cheap office chairs that has wheels and spins around but it<br/>
works for me.  Well thats it, talk to you guys later!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I play on a laptop: P4 1.19GHz, 512MB RAM, GeoForce2Go video card, <br/>
&gt; Windows XP. I have a TERRIBLE lag in Bazaar, and sometimes in PoK. <br/>
&gt; You guys think I should upgrade my video card? I know Sony doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; support playing on a laptop, but aside from the lag in those two <br/>
&gt; areas, it&#39;s working quite well.<br/>
