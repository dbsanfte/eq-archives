<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455477205">some people do get into eq through a friend and thay do power lvl <br/>
them. I seen a 65 cleric with epic who couldnt cast before oom. most <br/>
the time however power lvling is done by experanced players. I have a <br/>
friend who plays to about lvl 30 before deleting and starting <br/>
another, he enjoys going from lvl 1 to lvl 30 in a day.  It took all <br/>
i  could do to make him play one to 65.  Dont get ripped on power <br/>
lvling.  When you have a lvl 70 with everything under the sun, I <br/>
doubt you will want to sit lfg for 9 hours with a lvl 25 necro. Iam <br/>
know lvl 51 and still see very few groups as the servers have fewer <br/>
people on.  As far as doing it naked its all about where you go and <br/>
skill in doing it, have done it a few times and i know how. I think <br/>
you may enjoy a druid so you will have the power to group power lvl <br/>
and solo.<br/>
