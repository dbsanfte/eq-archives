<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043538958">I constantly have to remind my mother to calm down when she&#39;s hunting stuff.<br/>
She&#39;s one of the &quot;get out of my camp&quot; type people. She was farming silks<br/>
with her lvl 17 and got mad bc a lvl 4 came over and was trying to hunt mobs<br/>
in the same area (the newbie area). She kept having a fit that he was going<br/>
after the mobs she wanted to kill. When I tried to explain to her that<br/>
technically farming is against the rules and the lvl 4 had every right to<br/>
hunt and wasn&#39;t doing anything wrong or even rude, she just yelled at me.<br/>
Then later on she was camping a spot with her lvl 10 where she was getting<br/>
xp and swirling shadows. A Baron came up and started killing mobs all around<br/>
her. She told him that she was getting xp from them and asked him to stop it<br/>
bc she&#39;d been there first. He told her she could get xp elsewhere and that<br/>
he just wanted the swirling shadows. but she was after those too. After the<br/>
tried to reason with him he got mad and told her to go ahead and petition,<br/>
and then started intentionally ksing every lesser shade she attacked. I<br/>
mentioned it to some of my guild alliance and I think one of them said<br/>
something to him bc he went away. I mean, the dude could&#39;ve gotten more<br/>
swirling shadows off of the shadows in twilight sea but he had to be a dick<br/>
and KS a lvl 10. But I guess what goes around comes around.<br/>
I had someone else ks me at the same camp before. He said I was being a<br/>
bitch when I complained that he ksed 3 mobs that I had snared and was in the<br/>
process of fighting. Some people are just jerks.<br/>

It is amazing that people can play this game to the mid-20s and not<br/>
understand that accidents happen.  I am talking<br/>
about them Frez, not you.  You did nothing wrong, these individuals<br/>
sound like anti-social babies.  I wouldn&#39;t worry,<br/>
your reputation will overcome the lies.<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing EQ since the month it came out and have had people<br/>
shout &quot;GET LOST -OUR CAMP!!&quot; when I<br/>
just ran by (not through) the camp with nothing arggo!<br/>
There are some real idiots in the game that don&#39;t understand that 1)<br/>
don&#39;t know how to share, 2) don&#39;t understand<br/>
that if you play enough, you will get accidently trained, you will die<br/>
because someone makes a mistake.  If people can&#39;t understand that<br/>
they need to either grow up or not play at all.</div>
