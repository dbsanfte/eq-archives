&gt; As a newb, its hard not to feel a little intimidated by the <br/>
&gt; discussions here. I am in AWE of you people even though I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; understand half of what you say. I long for the day when I can talk <br/>
&gt; about the finer ponts of EQ like you guys. <br/>

<br/>
Secondly, the game is very simple to grasp. All you need are three <br/>
things, 1) common sense, 2) patience, and 3) being resourceful.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, the only &quot;finer&quot; points of EQ discussion is how so-and-so <br/>
mob in PoP was done completely wrong, or how incredibly weak the <br/>
items were when they killed it. Hardly awe-inspiring.</div>
