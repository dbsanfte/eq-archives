<b>Subject:</b> Problem Signing On/Staying On <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-786615827">I have a friend who is having an unusually difficult time signing on and<br/>
staying online.  It seems that just about any time she zones, you can<br/>
assume she will not be on anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a common problem?  Does anyone have some &quot;quick fix&quot; ideas that<br/>
might keep her from being punted so easily?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Alazais&quot;</div>
