<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917302805">I LOVE to argue.  Where are these idiots when I am playing I would love to<br/>
just open up on someone like this.  Its times like this I wish I was on a<br/>
PvP server b/c I would wait till he was just about 2 bubbles and instead of<br/>
healing I would Bomb him and then loot all the PP he should have shared and<br/>
taken one of his items.  I sure miss UO, anyone here play UO before?<br/>

Yeah. Sometimes you group with the only people available though. Like in<br/>
Highpass if you need in a group you&#39;re stuck with the people camping the<br/>
room you want to camp.<br/>
I&#39;ve had mostly good experiences with looting but there are a few people<br/>
who&#39;ve given me trouble. One thing that pissed me off-- I was group leader<br/>
and had alpha loot established. My computer crashed. When i logged back in<br/>
there was a new group leader. Despite the fact that I had been at the spawn<br/>
point first and had established the group, he felt that bc he had reinvited<br/>
people that he was now in charge. He said it was FFA -- ninja loot.<br/>
When I asked them to allow me to loot just once corpse he told me I could if<br/>
I was fast enough. Often while I was busy healing him he&#39;d go loot<br/>
something. When it was clear he didn&#39;t appreciate my help, I left. I mean, I<br/>
need money to buy spells and stuff.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I, too, play a main healer (cleric), and have encountered this many<br/>
&gt; times.  I either decide that the experience is worth it and miss out<br/>
&gt; on looting, or I quit the group and look for another.  The tanks<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t appreciate what you bring to the group until you are gone.<br/>
&gt; Also, while there are more of the type looter you describe in the<br/>
&gt; game, there are many who strive to be fair and succeed.  Perhaps you<br/>
&gt; should choose your friends more wisely...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few<br/>
&gt; problems with<br/>
&gt; &gt; loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play<br/>
&gt; the main<br/>
&gt; &gt; healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to<br/>
&gt; establish alpha<br/>
&gt; &gt; loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All<br/>
&gt; they care<br/>
&gt; &gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else<br/>
&gt; gets a<br/>
&gt; &gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of<br/>
&gt; loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and<br/>
&gt; he was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; expensive<br/>
&gt; &gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he<br/>
&gt; picked up a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s only<br/>
&gt; &gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
&gt; &gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just wondering.<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; &gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; people cooperate.<br/>
