<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063060968">Were you able to get in on the skele kill fest and mega sweet loot <br/>
action? They did a cool little Holloween thing where there were Skeletal <br/>
armies poping up on all the newbie zones and the Skeletal Comanders <br/>
would drop some awsome twink gear! It was still going on last night so <br/>
check it out and see if it&#39;s still going on and get some cool stuff!<br/>
<br/>
Oh and if you are lower than lvl50, I would suggest grouping or get a <br/>
higher level to assist you. Those Skeles hit HARD!<br/>
