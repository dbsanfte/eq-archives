don&#39;t like powerleveling much, either.&nbsp; As I had stated in my original 
post, I just want to get the husband&#39;s char up a level or two so we can travel 
together.&nbsp; He&#39;s 10th and I&#39;m 16th.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been playing for a while 
(though I had a long layover) and he&#39;s only been playing for a month or 
so.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, isn&#39;t the formula: level + (level/2) used to 
determine who can group and still gain exp?</span></font></div>

don&#39;t think that I would ever want to be powerleveled, myself.&nbsp; It seems 
like a big pain in the neck to get all one&#39;s stats up to par.&nbsp; I can also 
honestly say that I really don&#39;t care if I ever get a character up to 60th 
lvl.&nbsp; What&#39;s the point in reaching the end game as fast as you can?&nbsp; I 
say have fun along the way and roleplay like you would with paper and 
dice.&nbsp; Okay, maybe not speaking in an mock English accent to the computer 
screen (at least not when anyone&#39;s looking), but still!</span></font></div>

way, has anyone heard anything about the new roleplaying server?&nbsp; Has there 
been any word on when/if it will launch?&nbsp; I&#39;d heard that they were trying 
to work out the kinks&nbsp;to make sure that no one could communicate if they 
didn&#39;t speak the same language.&nbsp; I can see that this would be a problem if 
people used /emote to speak to each other, or even use their character 
description.</span></font></div>

 size="2">Opinions vary. I personally find the whole power leveling idea to be 
  most dishonorable. To see an orc camp taken over by a 50+ druid and a lv 6 
  ogre warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer reminds me how people are have 
  no willingness to work for things (the whole cheat code thing). But many 
  people find it ok to twink/power level and, well, so be it. I can see it, 
  shiver, and keep moving. Live and let live. I am fortunate that at lv 43 I can 
  solo and this is only an inconvience at worse to me instead of a real issue. 
  But up until lv 35 I was still having camps stolen from me by uber twinks and 
  anon druids. </font></span></div>
