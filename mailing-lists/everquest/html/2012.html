<br/>
&quot;For non-expansion users, it would stand to reason that the major (if not<br/>
sole) barrier between them and DirectX 7+ play would be the Vah Shir model.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Obviously you never played on the test server the final few weeks before the<br/>
release of Luclin, when they implemented the DirectX 8.1 coding.  There were<br/>
no new models, no new menus, interfaces, etc.  The old world flew... The<br/>
&quot;old&quot; models under the character selection screen spun so fast, they were<br/>
making me dizzy. :)  The introduction of DX8 streamlined the entire game<br/>
(old and new graphics).  This also made room, from a graphical latency<br/>
standpoint, to provide an engine that could handle the new models as well as<br/>
upgraded resolution for every texture in the game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think you&#39;re misreading my arguments, I don&#39;t in any way feel that it&#39;s<br/>
necessary for Verant to offer backward compatability for expansion users.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
**** Previous Post<br/>
&quot;There has been no enhancements (at least to my knowledge) of the pre-Luclin<br/>
graphics aside from the new character models all of which can be disabled<br/>
except for the Vah Shir model. By allowing users to get by with an older<br/>
version of DirectX, older video cards are still acceptable.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Not sure how I could have misread you.  You wish that they would offer the<br/>
old DX7 compatible engine.. Alongside the new DX8 engine.  There is no way<br/>
to offer such a implementation other then having multiple engines.  Again,<br/>
this expansion and update goes beyond the addition of the Vah Shir model.<br/>
See the first paragraph... Heck read it from the developers themselves -&gt;<br/>

&quot;If it came at no significant cost, everyone would want the improved<br/>
graphics (except that silly new troll model ;) but there is a cost involved,<br/>
and one that a significant portion of people are unwilling to pay.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Yeah that&#39;s like saying why do I need a color T.V.. Everyone would love a<br/>
color one if they could afford it, yet a significant portion of people are<br/>
unwilling to pay.  Move beyond the past.  Please remember... the days of<br/>
going to Radio Shack and paying outrageous prices for PC hardware has been<br/>
replaced by the overwelming competition these days.  Computer parts now<br/>
(unless your insisting on having the top of the line in home computing) are<br/>
cheap.  And even the specifications introduced with the expansion fall well<br/>
within the &quot;Cheap&quot; hardware range.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bah, that was just a way of expressing that to myself and more than a few<br/>
others, RPGs are more about content and depth than pretty pictures. If you<br/>
want stylish graphics, go play Quake or something. The graphics on most<br/>
first person shooters are far superior to even the new Luclin models.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With the intro of Luclin they added both content as well as graphic<br/>
enhancements.  Who cares about Quake... If some night I feel like playing it<br/>
that would have nothing to do with the graphics.  In my past post I limited<br/>
my comparison to other MMORPG&#39;s. And I would have to say the detail on the<br/>
new luclin models are nothing to scoff at.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As things moved on, their games got worse and worse, but it was their<br/>
pushing<br/>
graphical boundaries initially that started their decline. (notice that<br/>
Sierra who put out just as many horrid games, if not more, but at least<br/>
stuck to reasonable requirements, is still around and successful today)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah well nothing like complaining about pushing graphical boundaries...<br/>
That just sounds silly :).  Some reason I never found their games to be<br/>
taxing on my system in the least.  I was even running and old 286 at the<br/>
time.  I sincerely doubt that the requirements they requested (that was the<br/>
pre-3d accelerated cards era) had any significance with their demise.  I<br/>
remember that they spent well over 4 million dollars to create Wing<br/>
Commander 3, and even hired Mark Hamil *Luke Skywalker* as the lead roll in<br/>
their live action segments.  Their demise came from losing their deal with<br/>
LucasArts for the creation of the X-wing series.  Which if any of you<br/>
remember required the same hardware standards as the Wing Commander line,<br/>
the only difference was that Star Wars magic.  Origin from that point was<br/>
Dead.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;(again, referring to people who cannot play EQ Classic due to the patches,<br/>
not people who are unable to run Luclin)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All I hear is a violin playing in the background.  I&#39;m willing to bet that a<br/>
majority of the players out there that have problems right now , apart from<br/>
a few bugs, are due to the retirement of Windows 95.  If Microsoft had<br/>
released a final DX8 for that OS I doubt we would even be having this<br/>
dialogue.  But then again, does a **gaming** company compete by supporting<br/>
an OS that&#39;s over 7 years old now and which is retired?  Even that question<br/>
in itself sounds ridiculous to ask.  Well we will see, aye if you like the<br/>
game I believe you will find that loyal customers will find a way to play.<br/>
This doesn&#39;t even include the number of players out there still running<br/>
Voodoo cards - that&#39;s a whole different issue in itself.<br/>
<br/>
