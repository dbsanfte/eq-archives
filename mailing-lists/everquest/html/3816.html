There&#39;s been a lot of fuss about this on the eqloft boards (the official<br/>
UBISoft site - UBI is the Euro distributor for EQ) and there has been some<br/>
movement on the part of UBI, however still a LOT of confusion and many many<br/>
European players are saying they will just stick with the US servers and<br/>
paying the extra import charges for ordering POP from the US or Canada to<br/>
have it on time.<br/>
for example:<br/>
still no official announcment on a /movelog<br/>
POP still only available in Europe well after the US - even from the SOE<br/>
online store it appears that delivery will be weeks later<br/>
Still no info on whether the US/UK version of POP will work in France,<br/>
Germany (and they seem to have completely forgotten about the REST of<br/>
Europe.....)<br/>
The big problem seems to be that if you want to play on both US and Euro<br/>
servers you will have to buy a WHOLE new version of the game for the Euro<br/>
servers......<br/>

Subject: NERVs and new servers (Re: [EverQuest] Any comments on the<br/>
changes?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i wouldn&#39;t say those changes are nervs ... imho this &quot;balancing&quot; only<br/>
effects how some &quot;ueber&quot; guilds were able to raid (and farm) some<br/>
(high level) places.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
what really annoys me, and i don&#39;t think this will affect most of the people<br/>
in<br/>
this group, but european players, is how PoP and the new<br/>
servers will be &quot;introduced&quot; to non-US players. from what i read so<br/>
far, those new servers will not show up on the normal server<br/>
selection. also there will be a US-PoP and a non-US-PoP distribution.<br/>
<br/>
only the UK version of PoP can be used to upgrade to the US-version<br/>
OR the non-US version (but it is a one way ticket, with no option to play on<br/>
both kinds of servers). all other european version will only<br/>
connect to the new/european servers. options, how current accounts<br/>
can be converted from an US to a non-US version, are not officially<br/>
availible, yet. also there is no comment if a &quot;movelog&quot; will be<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
why i am so concerned about it? because i am from germany.<br/>
<br/>
and i use EQ as sort of a vaction from my job. in the last weeks,<br/>
many events made it no real enjoyment for me anymore. and after some<br/>
RL friends moved from Tarew Marr to Solusek Ro, i really started to<br/>
think about my EQ-future. i thought about moving the highest level<br/>
char from each of my four accounts (would be $200). also i stopped<br/>
going after items, but only more exp (to save the spells) and i<br/>
really try to finish my (mage) epic, because this is the only epic<br/>
that can be moved with you (because it is a spell). there are also<br/>
some othere reason, why i don&#39;t want to loose all the time, energy<br/>
and nerves i invested in collecting the items in the last 18 months.<br/>
<br/>
but with those PoP annoucements i really have to make up my mind<br/>
again: is the EQ addiction really worth all the pain it gives me?<br/>
