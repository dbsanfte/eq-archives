<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972428303">I started blacksmithing.  So far I&#39;ve got it up to 38 points without<br/>
putting too much money in it besides spending on molds, sharpening<br/>
stones, and water.  I&#39;d like to keep it that way.  But now it&#39;s<br/>
becoming a little less clear how I should proceed since the things I<br/>
make no longer give me more experience.<br/>
<br/>
So far things have gone as follows:<br/>
<br/>
rusty stuff -&gt; tarnished stuff -&gt; ore -&gt; metal bits.  From metal bits<br/>
I&#39;d make either files, studs, or skewers.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I&#39;m wondering if there are more easy to find stuff that I<br/>
can make things from that will further my experience as a blacksmith?</div>
