Apparently it is any female high elf. She gives you a letter to take to<br/>
Niola in the mage guild in Felwithe.<br/>

The dress also drops off of creatures in befallen and unrest. But it doesn&#39;t<br/>
really look worth it. You can look up stuff that might be better than it and<br/>
easy to obtain.<br/>

&gt; hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have Spent the last 4 days hunting in cb for a female elf slave in blue<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dress to hand the task master earing to, but all i ever see are wood elf<br/>
type slaves, non in blue dress. Are the slaves in blue dress for real?, i<br/>
have searched every single spawn point for the slaves, even had them all<br/>
killed, and freed a whole bunch but no high elf slave ever spawns . is there<br/>
any other way to get the gossamer robe? I tried to buy it but no-one ever<br/>
seems to sell or advertise it for sale.<br/>
