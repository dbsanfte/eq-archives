  Ok I normally don&#39;t resort to begging, but I&#39;m desperate here.<br/>
  I recently scheduled a raid for Chardok to kill Overking Bathezid for my<br/>
  cleric epic.<br/>
  I had druids, tanks, high lvl clerics, etc.. Unfortunately the mage that<br/>
was<br/>
  supposed to come was a no-show. So the raid had to be cancelled as we<br/>
didn&#39;t<br/>
  have enough people to fight their way in.<br/>
  I then realized that I don&#39;t even know any high level mages who are not<br/>
kos<br/>
  in chardok (and who have the ability to summon people to them).<br/>
  If you know anyone who has such a character or are such a person, please<br/>
  please please let me know. I will give free rezzes with my click stick<br/>
once<br/>
  I get it.<br/>
  Thanks in advance.<br/>
  luv,<br/>
  -Su aka Conwyn 54 cleric<br/>
