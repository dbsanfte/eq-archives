<b>Subject:</b> o how i love Criz Tzo`mok <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028786421">Crix is in LOIO..... im 43 and hes blue to me.... so hes too easy.  <br/>
but when i was 39 and i found out about him, he was great..... well <br/>
the great thing about him is that he respawns RIGHT when u kill him, <br/>
which is great.  o well i was just tellin everyone for the lower lvl <br/>
groups that wanna camp the hell out of him!  good luck</div>
