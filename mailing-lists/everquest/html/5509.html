<div id="ygrps-yiv-967723355">To coincide with what Melanie is saying, I think it would be more helpful<br/>
not so much to make a group chat window but to make a Melee window.  I<br/>
created a second chat box and put it at the top of my screen so its not<br/>
directly in my view.  I used it to filter all melee based messages into it<br/>
such as Others hits, others misses, and so on.  The only melee based<br/>
messages I kept in my main window were critical hits, non-melee damage, and<br/>
death messages.  It cuts down considerably on the amount of scroll you see<br/>
during a fight.  Particularly if you are not the one fighting.  That way if<br/>
you do miss something in group chat you dont have to scroll back so far to<br/>
see it.    Just make sure that you set which window you always want to chat<br/>
to.   You can also set up a smaller window strictly for guild chat as well<br/>
if you ever get in a guild.    If you&#39;d like, I will take a screenshot of my<br/>
user interface and send it to you.  Then you can get some ideas on how other<br/>
people have theirs and it might help you figure out your own method.<br/>
<br/>
As far as a shaman goes, they are the best class for buffs.  Their melee<br/>
spells are a lot like druids with  and solo very similarly.  The difference<br/>
is that shamans are barbarians, iksars, etc.;.. races which also make good<br/>
tanks.  Shamans also get decent pets which grow as you get higher in level.<br/>
You can command the pet to fight for you while you sit back and med.  This<br/>
works even in groups where you&#39;re the main healer.  It&#39;s an extra tank.  Pet<br/>
fights, you heal.  Also, shamans are wisdom based casters, so wisdom is<br/>
still an improtant stt for you to keep raised.  A suggestion would be to try<br/>
and equip yourself with armor, weapons, jewelry that has + wis to it.  The<br/>
higher your wisdom, the greater your mana pool.  This comes in handy at<br/>
later levels.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I hope that helps.  Shaman is a very cool class for a multitude of<br/>
reasons.  Not to mention you have the ability to make potions that you can<br/>
sell for much plat.   You also get SOW 5 levels earlier than druids do, and<br/>
you can turn into a bear!  How cool is that?<br/>

<br/>
&gt; About the group chat thing....<br/>
&gt; Another thing I do, is create a seperate chat window<br/>
&gt; just for group chat. Right click on the top of your<br/>
&gt; chat window where it says Main chat, click new chat<br/>
&gt; window, then rearrange and resize all your windows<br/>
&gt; untill you get a setup that you can work with and live<br/>
&gt; with. I try to keep both my chat boxes at the bottom,<br/>
&gt; and made a bit smaller so that they both are<br/>
&gt; side-by-side.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the shaman advice, I myself have never played<br/>
&gt; one. But I do know that they are mostly wanted in<br/>
&gt; groups for their great buffs and their ability to slow<br/>
&gt; the mob. Also, if you have a cleric in your group,<br/>
&gt; shaman are great back-up healers.<br/>
