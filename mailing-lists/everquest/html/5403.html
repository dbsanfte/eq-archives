<div id="ygrps-yiv-978955654">Well, it goes both ways. Sometimes the tanks aren&#39;t doing enough damage to<br/>
maintain aggro. I&#39;ve been in groups where the tank sucked and couldn&#39;t keep<br/>
aggro off of someone who was doing very little damage.<br/>
Also, it *is* the tank&#39;s job to keep aggro off of the groups healers.<br/>
Healers can try to keep their aggro down, but if we have to CH the tank,<br/>
that means we will probably get aggro (unless the tank is good at taunting).<br/>
It just comes down to how the group works as a whole. I&#39;ve heard rangers and<br/>
warriors argue with each other about aggro and using nonaggro or aggro type<br/>
weapons.<br/>

In PoP a bard is the puller of choice. Who cares if lull fails, if we can<br/>
fade. Faster then trying to split the pull. If you are pulling aggro off of<br/>
a tank, well, you are doing it wrong. It is not thier job to keep aggro off<br/>
you, but your job to not pull it off the tank. Try FD every 30 seconds. Then<br/>
you can do max damage.<br/>
