<div id="ygrps-yiv-572460745"><p>About the only place to find them is the bazaar.&nbsp; They are player crafted using pottery. If you don&#39;t have luclin,&nbsp; you should have a friend get them for you.&nbsp; they run from anywhere from 10pp up to 100pp on vazaelle.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t have luclin,&nbsp; I would recommend getting it.&nbsp; there are zones where you can fight &amp; get tons of XP per fight &amp; level fairly quickly.&nbsp; Would also recommend getting PoP just for PoK.&nbsp; you can go to almost any city on norrath &amp; luclin, so you&#39;re not waiting for the boats or nexus spires anymore =D
