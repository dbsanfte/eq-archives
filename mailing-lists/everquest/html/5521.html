<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986224621">I also have a human monk and train Safe Fall by falling.  I find a bridge in<br/>
the Plane of Knowledge (no monsters) and figure out how high I need to fall<br/>
from to take damage, but as little damage as possible.  I drop an item on<br/>
that spot, shruiken usually, so that I know where to jump off at when I run<br/>
back up.  A while of that and I stop taking damage from that level and move<br/>
the item up the bridge.  I don&#39;t usually have to fall to many times to make<br/>
it raise a point.  There is a max you can raise a skill to, so once you hit<br/>
the max you will never gain more points until you go to another level.  I<br/>
think it&#39;s 5x level +10 so at 9 max is 55, but I could be wrong.  This may<br/>
be why you can not raise it now.  I would never spend points on Safe Fall, I<br/>
put all my points in Mend.  I find Mend to helpful to waste just to train,<br/>
unless you are just training and not facing any real dangers.  All my<br/>
fighting and defense skills tend to max out from fighting so I see no reason<br/>
to add to them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; As a monk, how do I improve my safe fall skill without spending all<br/>
&gt; my points on it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I keep jumping off tall things and taking damage but no improvement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why are all the characters white?  What if I want to play a black<br/>
&gt; person?<br/>
