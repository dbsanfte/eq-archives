<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147043044">Oh, I agree, the xp is undeniably faster, and the role you play in a<br/>
group is vastly different than soloing (I have a 55 druid myself who<br/>
I&#39;ve spent 95% to the time soloing), but I have a 39 paladin that has<br/>
been an exclusive solo character and I do just fine.  I average at<br/>
least one level per gameplay session and I don&#39;t have to rely on a<br/>
cleric to heal me or anyone else for that matter.  My wife and I used<br/>
to exclusively duo/group and I felt myself squelched by others<br/>
(including her).  I might want to go to a particular zone to get<br/>
steady xp or good loot without the hassles, but I would be overruled<br/>
or pushed into going someplace I really didn&#39;t want to go.  Soloing<br/>
was my escape from dealing with that.  I know that EQ is supposed to<br/>
be a social game, but sometimes, I just like to be alone.<br/>

&gt; Soloing dang i have been soloing since i started playing and getting<br/>
into a group seems strange at times for me id rather be in a group at<br/>
times makes game more fun i just wish groups would be more but seems<br/>
to me groups are slim to none. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Not me.  I prefer grouping.  It&#39;s faster xp than soloing in my<br/>
opinion.  As a 65 <br/>
&gt; &gt; druid, I can solo a lot of things, but it takes too much time to<br/>
kill them.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Root, snare, dot, dot, dot.  Sit and wait.  Keep that up til the<br/>
mob is dead.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; In a group, most times I only have to worry about snaring and<br/>
dotting, and maybe <br/>
&gt; &gt; back up healing.  It&#39;s not as labor intensive, and the xp moves<br/>
faster with <br/>
&gt; &gt; constant pulls.  Unfortunately, lately, it seems like it&#39;s been<br/>
increasingly <br/>
&gt; &gt; more difficult to find good groups so I end up soloing most of the<br/>
time anyway <br/>
&gt; &gt; with LFG on.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   After a year and a half of playing, I&#39;ve done a lot of group<br/>
play and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   a lot of duoing, but I seem to enjoy soloing more nowdays.  I can go<br/>
&gt; &gt;   where I want, do what I want and keep the loot and xp for myself. <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still like to group, but sometimes, for my own<br/>
&gt; &gt;   peace of mind, I much prefer soloing.  Anyone else?<br/>
