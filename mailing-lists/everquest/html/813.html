&gt;Why you wish to keep the player that did this to you in the dark I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;understand, you warn us but won&#39;t tell us who we should be ware of? I <br/>
&gt;always believed that criminals should be punished publically and their vile <br/>
&gt;deeds announced worldwide.. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; For those of you who took the time to read my previous posting in <br/>
&gt;reguards<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the 7500pp I lost to an exploiter, I would like to take the time to <br/>
&gt;thank<br/>
&gt; &gt; you all. I recieved numerous suggestions, and more support than I ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; expected to get about the matter. But after all I have tried to <br/>
&gt;accomplish,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it has amounted to nothing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Last night, I once again was in a heated debate with Tinysa (even though <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had been informed by a guide that she wouldn&#39;t be on until Thursday <br/>
&gt;night).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After lengthy discussion, I was informed that neither my money nor the <br/>
&gt;Thick<br/>
&gt; &gt; Banded Belt would be returned to me, as there was no record on the <br/>
&gt;backup<br/>
&gt; &gt; tapes of the transaction having ever occured. I was informed after much<br/>
&gt; &gt; questioning, that ALL COMPLETED trades conducted by players was logged.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Grudgingly, I got Tinysa to admit that it seemed a bit odd that 7500pp <br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt; &gt; simply vanish off a character into thin air. However, I was informed <br/>
&gt;that it<br/>
&gt; &gt; did not warrant further investigation because I could have just left the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cash on the ground for someone else to pick up which also would not have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been logged (yeah - as if I&#39;m going to leave 48+ days of savings around <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone to pick up).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Based upon the information I recieved last night, and from the numerous<br/>
&gt; &gt; emails I have recieved from other players about the matter, I have come <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the following conclusion - I believe that the Thick Banded Belt that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; bought had indeed been exchanged. However it is my belief that for <br/>
&gt;whatever<br/>
&gt; &gt; reason, the server detected it as a duplicate, and destroyed it. As <br/>
&gt;such, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; would not have registered as a completed trade, and there for would not <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been logged.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To the best of my knowledge, the GM&#39;s did everything they possibly could <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; verify this information short of restoring the offending character, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; verifying that they did indeed have my 7500pp cash. In fact, they had me<br/>
&gt; &gt; doubting that I had actually conducted the trade until I pulled up the<br/>
&gt; &gt; screenshot of the trade that I had managed to take a snapshot of, and <br/>
&gt;looked<br/>
&gt; &gt; at it closely. Based on the screenshot which I myself had taken, I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; clearly see the items in question in both trade windows so I know the <br/>
&gt;trade<br/>
&gt; &gt; had taken place. I also presented the time and date that it occured<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Date/Time info off of the screenshot) to no avail. In the end, I lost <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt; money. I&#39;ll never see it again...... Cheaters 99999..... Good guys<br/>
&gt; &gt; 0............. I guess it doesn&#39;t pay to be honest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Once again, I stress the fact that I merely present this information to <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt; so that you may avoid having this happen to you. This in no way is a <br/>
&gt;rant,<br/>
&gt; &gt; flame, gripe, or an attempt to get a thread going about duping/cheating.<br/>
