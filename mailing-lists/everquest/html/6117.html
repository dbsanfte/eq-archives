<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m relatively new to EQ, an I&#39;m 
sill feeling my way around things.&nbsp;I do havfe a question. No th Trade 
skills, Im understand most of them, they&#39;re pretty straitforward...but I do have 
a question bout the cooking one. Why? I understand smithing...get ore, make 
bars, make weapons/armour...I know in EQ, every so many time units, you 
automaticlly eat food. Since rations and milk will fill this funcion, &nbsp;what 
is the purpose of cookin and brewing? Do you get more food value out of 
something you&#39;ve made, as oppoised to the rations and bisquits? Can you eat the 
food and get boosts from it? Same thing for the brewing? Or is it just a vanity 
thing to be walking around with something you cooked as opposed to the iron 
raions and milk thing...</font></div>
