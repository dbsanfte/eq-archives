<div>I remember starting as a Vah Shir on Luclin not too long after its release.&nbsp; No PoK ment a &quot;risk your life&quot; run to get to the Nexus to get to Norrath.&nbsp; Lots of people started vah shir and when they realized what was involved to get to the nexus and Norrath many just deleted them till after PoK.&nbsp; I do miss those days, although I never really did get that high in level till after PoK came out so I&#39;m not sure if the higher levels would be the same for me or not.&nbsp; Seemed for me the main problem in the higher levels was that I needed to know a lot of others if I wanted to really do any hunting that would get me anything better than what I could just buy.&nbsp; When all your doing is general farming for money while waiting for hours with LFG on before someone decides to invite you, it really burns you out too fast.&nbsp; I stopped playing not too long ago (before the newest expansion (which some friends of mine who still play said they loved)) but I would be very tempted to&nbsp;be able to play at that time again.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe it will become so good an idea they will make other &quot;Classic&quot; servers.&nbsp; One for only the first release, another for all to the Velious and Kunark expansions.</div></td></tr>
