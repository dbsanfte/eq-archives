<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688253233">I bought my machine last year for Christmas. A gift for the family. <br/>
It was a mid-range system at that time, though I did not know that <br/>
the 256k memory limit would make it low-end so quickly. I added a 3d <br/>
card at about six months, not knowing that the standard was moving <br/>
ahead so fast. With the knowledge I now have, I may have scraped up a <br/>
bit more and bought higher end, but it was not then a good economic <br/>
move.<br/>
<br/>
I will be adding enough memory in a few weeks to bring my system up <br/>
to it&#39;s 256k max. I ordered sol in the summer, with the expectation <br/>
that the 128k minimum would be in place when released. I found that <br/>
my max would now be the new minimum.<br/>
<br/>
As is the system is nominally playable. With the new memory and <br/>
possibly a new graphics card (fortunately the cost of a gforce 2 has <br/>
dropped to an easily reachable level) the machine will serve. I <br/>
expect Sony/V will make improvements in the game to keep lower end <br/>
players viable for some time.<br/>
<br/>
Now I must plan to upgrade hardware and catch up, perhaps pull ahead <br/>
of the curve a bit so I am not always catching up.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I am not able to scrape up the $4k bucks for a real <br/>
kick-ass system like I see in the magazines. I will probably see what <br/>
a new tower with lots of memory, a gforce 3 and a good sized hard <br/>
drive will cost me, and begin saving in hopes of getting it online <br/>
before this system gets too old to play.<br/>
<br/>
For those of us on the lower end, we must hope Sony/V wants our bucks <br/>
enough to keep us alive a bit longer.<br/>
