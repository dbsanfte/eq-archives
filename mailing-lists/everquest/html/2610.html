 </span></blockquote>i don&#39;t know which robes i used at those levels. but i really believe<br/>
i was given a &quot;Flowing Black Robe&quot; by a higher player and my dream was<br/>
an &quot;Oracle Robe&quot;. at those times FBRs were 300pp and Oracles about 1kpp.<br/>
<br/>
today FBRs are 50pp to 150pp ... and Oracles are sold for 150pp to<br/>
300pp. i don&#39;t know what they are really worth, but i never paid more<br/>
when i needed one for my babies (eg alts).<br/>
<br/>
i checked allakhazam for other ones, because i also think about getting<br/>
me a new one, but it isn&#39;t easy at all.<br/>
<br/>
at your level you should go for a robe with AC, and MANA bonus. also<br/>
a HP modifier wouldn&#39;t hurt. when reaching 30 to 35 i would go for<br/>
a robe with INT, AC. at my current level (and INT over 200) i look<br/>
for a robe with INT and AC but it also should have resistance and MANA<br/>
stats. actually the more stats it has, the better ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
if you have access to allakhazam and can search for equipment, be sure<br/>
to turn off NO DROP, and GM ONLY items for your level ... it is almost<br/>
impossible that you will get them. (and it always hurts knowing what<br/>
items exist in game ;-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; buying stuff off other players defies the point of the game)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>imho economy is an important part of the game and there is nothing<br/>
&quot;bad&quot; about it. you never have to buy or sell anything if you don&#39;t<br/>
want to.<br/>
<br/>
also think about tradeskills. to reach a level, where you can do<br/>
items other really want/need, those folks want to get paid. and if<br/>
you ever tried to raise tradeskills like jewelcraft, smithing, or<br/>
fletching to a level in the range of 150 to 200, you will know,<br/>
why you don&#39;t only have to pay the components they needed for the<br/>
one item they should make for you. have a look at &quot;www.eqtrader.com&quot;<br/>
at some tailoring or smithing components needed for velious stuff.<br/>
<br/>
my favorite example is &quot;ice burrower silk armor&quot; (velious silk<br/>
tailoring):<br/>

the silk patches you need is dropped by &quot;Ice Burrower&quot;s:<br/>
