<div id="ygrps-yiv-137853868">When I was lower level (5th to 15th) I realised that merchants were selling<br/>
batwings, scales and bone chips for ~ 1Gp per stack (give or take my Cha,<br/>
etc).  Players would buy them from  me for 1 to 2 Pp per stack.  Can you say<br/>
HELL YES! ?  I resold more components than I fought for by a factor of at<br/>
least 100.  Buying and selling components can be a good way for lower level<br/>
players to make some quick cash.<br/>
