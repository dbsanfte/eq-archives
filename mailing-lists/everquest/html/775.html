<b>Subject:</b> Planar Travel - opinions, tips, strategies <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638768">These lists have been dead for too long, so in an attempt to spur some <br/>
discussion here, and because I&#39;ll be venturing into the Plane of Hate and <br/>
Fear very soon with my DE SK, I would like to hear opinions, tips and <br/>
strategies from those who do plane trips on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the things mentioned by various high level players on my server, is <br/>
that they use alternate equipment in the case they can not return to recover <br/>
their corpses (IE - use combine weapons and banded armor for instance). Any <br/>
information that anyone would be willing to share, would be much <br/>
appreciated. I anticipate hearing what you all have to say/share!<br/>
