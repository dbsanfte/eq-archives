&gt; Personally I think that EQ would have lasted twice as long, if not 10<br/>
times as long, if they had 3 times as many servers so there would be no more<br/>
than 500 players on each server at peak hours.. I hate the standing in line<br/>
for a camp shit, what&#39;s the adventure about that? Although new zones are<br/>
coming and the update that is due in march will HOPEFULLY boost this game to<br/>
new levels, I am hoping for an entirely new continent, a few new<br/>
races/classes, perhaps a better graphics engine, enhanced quest system etc<br/>
etc, and a bundle of new features, perhaps even mounts for traveling etc..<br/>
They have alot of time to work on this upgrade and since they aren&#39;t doing a<br/>
really great job at keeping the running game up to date I pray that they are<br/>
spending all efforts on the upgrade.. We shall wait and see.. Meanwhile I am<br/>
going to play my character slow and easy like I have from the start, I might<br/>
not reach level 50 until it&#39;s time for the upgrade but all the better, I<br/>
won&#39;t be bored with the game too soon.. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; When you&#39;re looking at EQ you have to realize something, its part of the<br/>
first<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a long line of games to come. EQ, AC, and UO were pretty much the<br/>
first in<br/>
&gt; &gt; this genre, and like that will very soon not fit the players needs. As<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; people play more and more, they expect more and more from the game.<br/>
Coney Island<br/>
&gt; &gt; was originally a huge attraction because of its many many lights,<br/>
however, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; people began demanding more and more. EQ, UO, and AC in this genre you<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; &gt; relate pretty much to doom in the 1st person shooter genre. Things will<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; &gt; build from here, as the players demand more and more, the companies will<br/>
produce<br/>
&gt; &gt; bigger and better games trying to fit the players demands. Am I saying<br/>
that EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; is no longer worth playing, no. EQ is a really great game, and despite<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; debate as to whether the changes within it are good or bad, it still<br/>
attracts<br/>
&gt; &gt; many people. However, EQ is a dying game, I personally do not intend to<br/>
give up<br/>
&gt; &gt; on it because it satisfies my needs in gaming for now, however the<br/>
companies,<br/>
&gt; &gt; seeing that this is a very good market will keep releasing bigger and<br/>
better<br/>
&gt; &gt; games. I imagine there to be a flood of titles coming in, and within a<br/>
year or<br/>
&gt; &gt; so, one of them will fight its way to the top, such as half life, or<br/>
unreal in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the 1st person shooter genre. EQ isn&#39;t any worse then when people first<br/>
started<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing and loved it. The thing is that the players demands are<br/>
increasing more<br/>
&gt; &gt; and more, and EQ is striving to keep up. The only question is, how long<br/>
can it<br/>
&gt; &gt; last?<br/>
