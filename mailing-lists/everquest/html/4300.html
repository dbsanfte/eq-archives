&gt; &gt; EverQuest holds onto your unused and unpaid for accounts for six<br/>
&gt; &gt; months before deleting it.<br/>
&gt; No, they guarantee they won&#39;t delete accounts for 6 months, but they<br/>
&gt; have never yet actually deleted an inactive account. I know of several<br/>
&gt; people who have returned after a year or more and just reactivated their<br/>
&gt; account<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I have heard reports of people having their gear and money deleted<br/>
while their characters and levels were still there. So there&#39;s no guarantee<br/>
that you can just pick up where you left off.<br/>
