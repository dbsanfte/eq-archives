<div id="ygrps-yiv-763267829">Ok... If your pretty good at travelling, you can get to my favorite place to <br/>
fight at slightly-low levels.  You need to go from Kelething to Kaladim <br/>
first. I&#39;ve never done this and heard that it can be dangerous. Once you get <br/>
to Kaladim, I would suggest finding someone who can bind you there. Then <br/>
take the boat ride (approx. 40 - 1hr full round trip) to Freeport. Then <br/>
again get bound there so you don&#39;t have to ride the boring boat again. (FYI <br/>
- I would not suggest moving around on the ship a lot, while it is moving <br/>
itself. I have gotten stuck before between the mast and the wall on the 2nd <br/>
level of the ship, and was a real pain waiting 2 1/2 hours for a GM around 4 <br/>
AM.) Then you might want to find a person(s) heading in your same direction, <br/>
as this would be your first time. And watch out for griffons and hill giants <br/>
when passing through east/west commonlands. They seem to &quot;disapeer&quot; when <br/>
flying sometimes, and then pop-up behind and you fall to your death almost <br/>
instantly. From the west commonlands you zone into a forest called Kithicor <br/>
(I think?). Then just follow the zone border to the right, and when you get <br/>
to the rocky mountainside just go to the base and there should be the <br/>
entrance there. Then don&#39;t forget to get bound here to. Then there are <br/>
multiple things you can do here. There is a dungeon named RunnyEye (Which is <br/>
usually for higher levels [20 or so]) but there are 3 goblin camps here. And <br/>
1 orc camp. At level 4 I would just stick to the Klicknak&#39;s inside the great <br/>
wall, then at five go past the wall and look for shadow wolfs, and sometimes <br/>
balck bears. At 6-9 I would say just start solo&#39;ing the goblins. Verant <br/>
seems to have up&#39;ed the loot on them and now as a level 8 paladin. I can <br/>
bring in 10 - 15pp a day without so much work. The EXP here is great.<br/>

&gt;	I am a Level 4 Wood Elf Warrior and was wondeirng where would be a<br/>
&gt;good place to go hunting that would have a good profit and kills which <br/>
&gt;won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;be too, too challenging. Also, my guild, The Keepers of the Eternal Elves <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;going to be holding a tourney later on which I will have more info on at a<br/>
&gt;later date. But can someone please tell me a good place?<br/>
