Yeah, I heard about some of those and was like &quot;where was I when people were benefiting?&quot;<br/>
Although in truth I probably wouldn&#39;t cheat intentionally... I just wish they would allow addons or something to improve gameplay. It might be nice if they just figured out a way to make the game load faster..<br/>

&gt;What I hate more is when SOE tells us about an exploit they patched. I never<br/>
&gt;knew about it and therefore didn&#39;t take advantage of it and now I can&#39;t!<br/>
&gt;BAH! SOE don&#39;t tease me this way! LOL<br/>

&gt;Remind me to ban the next person that tries to spam the list with that<br/>
&gt;eqtotalsecrets thing. They tried at least 3 times this week I think.<br/>
