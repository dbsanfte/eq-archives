<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441726899">You need to get a port out to DL then run to Karnor&#39;s Castle. Outside KC<br/>
there are the brutes that drop the HQ hides you need to make the armor.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The other day I decided that a trip to Kunark was in order for my<br/>
&gt; druid. I will be needing Brute hides, and so was ready to go and hunt<br/>
&gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never met the boat. I<br/>
&gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and they went out to<br/>
&gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the boat left. The<br/>
&gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick off gnolls, and<br/>
&gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool box full of them.<br/>
&gt; have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there until I get the<br/>
&gt; rest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls, which I have<br/>
&gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I want to do it the<br/>
&gt; old-fashioned way.<br/>
