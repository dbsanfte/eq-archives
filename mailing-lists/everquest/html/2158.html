 </span></blockquote>Any higher level tailors out there? I am lvl 70 in tailoring, and <br/>
working toward making Halfling tailored and imbued armor. I am a <br/>
level 29 halfling druid, able so far to brew and smith the various <br/>
parts I have needed to make my reinforced leather armor. I am soon to <br/>
be off to Kunark to obtain my brute hides. Anyone been a brute <br/>
hunter, who can give me any advise?<br/>
<br/>
What minimum level shall I need to succeed in brute hunting? And what <br/>
sources for the high quality ore? I am not a good dungeon fighter, <br/>
especially solo. Runnyeye is a bit much without a good group, and so <br/>
far I have not found good groups for that fun place. Any suggestions <br/>
for the getting of the required ore? Any other places it drops?<br/>
<br/>
Do the metal pieces used in the halfling armor have to also be made <br/>
of hq ore, or just the sewing kit? The sites I have visited are not <br/>
all that clear on that one.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting, everyone!<br/>
