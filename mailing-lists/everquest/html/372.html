<b>Subject:</b> Info on a guild website? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-591195438">Hey there, Hi there, Ho there, fellow EQ addicts:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for a website that I stumbled across in my travels -- I was<br/>
there about 2 weeks ago and lost the URL.  (No, it&#39;s not in my history.)<br/>
It&#39;s a website for a dark elven guild that was really visually<br/>
appealing... the graphics were done similarly to those in Neriak (neon,<br/>
transparent, etc) on a black background.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen one like this?  Any information would be greatly<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
