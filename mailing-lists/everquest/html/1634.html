<div id="ygrps-yiv-829411291">Actually, I think he did have an RL relationship with her. But I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
I am still pissed at him about it. I lost all the xp I&#39;d earned that day bc<br/>

but it&#39;s unforgivable for him to drag someone else into it that he didn&#39;t<br/>
even know and that had never been mean to him.<br/>
