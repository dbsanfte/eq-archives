<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116312073">Well, all I know is that a few friends and i would spam the group during travels or whatever to learn languages and everyone would teach a different one and id get better at all of them, including the one i was teaching.  I was teaching vah shir to my friend who had about 25 under me and normally i would have hit 100, but i didnt budge from 80 the entire time.  It was strange and i was just curious what had changed.  But when i told the GM this, he said that it was never this way.  Strange<br/>

  I don&#39;t know that languages and the teaching of them has changed, but I can state for sure that it WAS so that you could teach languages in a group and every person in the group would get better at it.  All you needed to do was to constantly spam the group with text in the language you wanted to teach, assuming of course, you knew the language. <br/>
