<div id="ygrps-yiv-929478558">Yeah, the 4th shawl is the death squad. I get so tired<br/>
of wandering around, hoping to trip over that dwarf,<br/>
lol.<br/>
<br/>
Snow griffin eggs are the last part of the 3rd shawl.<br/>
Also boring, but at least you&#39;re killing stuff. :)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d heard they originally planned to have more than<br/>
&gt; 8 shawls but I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; heard of any quests to get more shawls after the<br/>
&gt; 8th. I think I read that<br/>
&gt; they planned to do 11 shawl quests or something. I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; be happy with 8 or 10.<br/>
&gt; I like even numbers. :-D But I hope they don&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; the skill needed to do<br/>
&gt; the shawl so ungodly high. I wish there were more<br/>
&gt; quests for tradeskills<br/>
&gt; that were doable at 101 to 120 range in skill.<br/>
&gt; The 4th.. is that the one with the triggers that<br/>
&gt; might spawn the deathsquad?<br/>
&gt; or is that the one that needs snow griffin eggs?<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Congrats! I&#39;ve never been able to get past the 4th<br/>
&gt; &gt; shawl on two of my toons... I get impatient, lol.<br/>
&gt; But<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m going to try and give it another shot.<br/>
