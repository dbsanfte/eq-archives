<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687166225"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Scanning through Pricewatch.com I noticed some pretty good prices on the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GF3 ti200 and ti500. So I will likely be going with that....but then again<br/>
the GF5s should be coming out within the next few weeks (according to a<br/>
magazine article I read) I think, and the prices should fall even further...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hate to sound like I&#39;m spamming, but another site that gives good prices<br/>
is pricegrabber.com. It has reviews of the stores selling the products as<br/>
well as the products themselves. It also takes your zip code and estimates<br/>
your shipping costs to show you which one is truly the lowest price. But I<br/>
like to use both pricewatch and pricegrabber to compare. I also sometimes<br/>
look at epinions.com to get customer reviews of products. I learned which<br/>
computer monitors to NOT get from epinions.<br/>
Research is always good. :-)<br/>
luv,<br/>
