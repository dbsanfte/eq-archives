<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088801029">I also did not recieve a key.  When I looked into it I noticed it said<br/>
player of &quot;mid-level&quot; characters.  Since my highest is 17 now, I think that<br/>
is why I was left out.  Not sure if this matters to you, but since the keys<br/>
were sent out starting May 31, you might have missed it because of that.<br/>
<br/>
Just a note, all keys not used go bad July 2, so if you have one you might<br/>
want to use it or let us know about it pretty soon.  Would hate to see all<br/>
those keys go bad.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone knows if there is a way to<br/>
&gt; request one of these keys? I have an EQ acount<br/>
&gt; already, but I believe it must have been inactive when<br/>
&gt; they first sent the buddy keys out. I recently<br/>
&gt; re-subscribed at the first of June, so I&#39;m not sure<br/>
&gt; when these keys came out. I was kind of hoping to get<br/>
&gt; one for my sister. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
