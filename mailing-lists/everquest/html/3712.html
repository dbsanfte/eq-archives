&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; That would only work if they accepted the TL.<br/>

raid, I&#39;ll assume that accepting the TL is the only <br/>
option.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has nothing to do with being nasty.  As a RL (or even <br/>
a participant in a raid), I have an obligation to <br/>
everyone on that raid to make it go as smoothly as <br/>
possible.  And if someone is repeatedly doing something <br/>
to put the raid at risk, then the RL has an obligation <br/>
to &quot;protect&quot; the rest of the raiders.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a 2-way street, Su.  If someone is screwing around, <br/>
wasting other people&#39;s time, why should I allow him to <br/>
stay on the raid?  I will give respect to nayone that <br/>
earns it, but if a person doesn&#39;t have the decency to <br/>
respect the RL and the raiders, I&#39;m not going to get <br/>
upset when I boot him (or when the RL boots him) from <br/>
the raid.<br/>
<br/>
A 2hr CR at midnight really sucks, especially if you <br/>
have to get up early the next morning for work.  It&#39;s <br/>
far worse when it&#39;s caused by some jack@ss that doesn&#39;t <br/>
feel the need to listen.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say we don&#39;t have fun on our raids, <br/>
because we do.  But we know that when it&#39;s time to get <br/>
to work, the play time stops.<br/>
<br/>
And if I wante to be nasty, I&#39;d leave them in the zone, <br/>
ungroupsed, with no way to get out.  Or I&#39;d let them die <br/>
and get their own damn corpse.  A TL is humane.<br/>
