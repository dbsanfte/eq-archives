<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788244675">the ends and out about power lvling is simple. get temp from a <br/>
cleric, get a druid. druid casts regn, str, damage shield, sow. goto <br/>
field of bone hit mob once move on, kill anything that walks away. <br/>
make sure druid is healing you. lvl 12 goto kurns tower ( off field <br/>
of bone ). kill in kurns tower to lvl 20 or intill something looks <br/>
green or light blue. goto paludal caverns lvl there the same way hit <br/>
mob once and move on. work your way to back tunnels and kill <br/>
shrinkens once there light  blue take the camps at zone in. from Here <br/>
you should be well on your way and zone choice can be done by you or <br/>
the druid.  Paw is mine it is getting nerfed soon.  I can lvl there <br/>
till late 35 or so. You could also goto into Crystal Caverns at 30 <br/>
for power lvling. Usualy by the time iam lvl 40 the druid is sick of <br/>
lvling me and i solo dawn shroud peak has zelnicks thay are cake for <br/>
a power lvled twinked player least it hasnt failed me. <br/>
<br/>
for you who say spells spells spells. have powerlvled warrior, monk, <br/>
cleric, enchanter, rogue, all to lvl 40. then soloed 40-50 and my <br/>
skills where maxed from soloing. the coin you get plus the 5 points <br/>
each lvl you can easly bring skills up spells to comp you at lvl 40 <br/>
to get by. each class has a main spell class bring it and evocation <br/>
up.  and the rest come in short order. I have only seen one person <br/>
power lvled so hard he couldnt cast. But normaly you will work <br/>
something up it does take time. and your melee skills will be maxed, <br/>
if not close, my rogue i just started not only maxed pierceing but <br/>
1hs as well.<br/>
<br/>
 You may not want or like power lvling how ever i see nothing wrong <br/>
with pling to 40 soloing to 50 before i begain my grouping career. <br/>
todayes game has drop gear cheap to make an old school 65 war on a 40 <br/>
war. so grping with people at lvls below 55 are slaying the mobs. its <br/>
not like it was when the game came out, and grps realy did need <br/>
players below 55 to play well. even my rouge can tank still at 46. <br/>
dont sweat lvl 70 because you not going to get there in a day. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    lvl 46 rogue in 4 days played less than two weeks.</div>
