<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066176018">The Forgotten Halls are a good place for xp (not great on loot<br/>
though), but it can be tough.  The rats there hit pretty hard, but<br/>
doable with Temp on at level 25.  Another place that I found, purely<br/>
by accident, was the sarnak fort in the southwest part of Lake of Ill<br/>
Omen.  There are two sarnak&#39;s at the gate, but once you break their<br/>
camp, you can single pull sarnak&#39;s out of there all day long.  Good<br/>
xp, decent loot (not uber, but decent) and there is hardly ever anyone<br/>
else in the zone, so no competition.<br/>

&gt; I have an idea, and you may like it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a little known zone, well its known but no body wants to go<br/>
there cause its abit out there. With the GOD expansion came a zone<br/>
called &quot;Forgotten Halls&quot;. It is adjacent to Jaggedpine Forrest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Its an instanced zone, so you can solo there or go in with 5<br/>
friends. Go to the LDON camps and speak to the maguses there. Tell<br/>
them &quot;Nedaria&#39;s Landing&quot; and you will be ported there. ONce in<br/>
Nedaria&#39;s, go to the docks and find a High Elven Male on the docks, I<br/>
forget his name, i think it starts with an &quot;E&quot;. Anyway, he is wearing<br/>
some kind of ornate tunic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do the dialog words and you will be given access, much like an LDON.<br/>
If you look at your compass, there will be a line marking your<br/>
direction. Follow the line and you will enter a cave, where you will<br/>
see some short chick, again her name escapes me. Do the dialog with<br/>
her, and yo then have access. Click on the rock beside her and your in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The nice thing about this zone, is at lower levels, nothing aggros<br/>
you. In here you  kill bats, rats, or &quot;earthen rejects&quot;.. There is a<br/>
bat room, a rat room, and room with a mix of bats, rats, and earthen<br/>
rejects. The rejects have a little more hp and hit a little harder,<br/>
but should be ok. WARNING... only attack bats, rats,or the earthen<br/>
rejects. Attack anything else and the whole zone will unleash hell<br/>
ipon your head.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The zone respawns quite fast, so if you go in with a couple people<br/>
you will never run out of mobs to kill. It does get boring, but if you<br/>
want quiet effortless killing, go here. I took my SK here and in about<br/>
3 hours, i managed to get her 2hs up from 20 to 100. Without a healer,<br/>
it is tough, but was doable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The xp is quite good. If its just you, then the xp is close to what<br/>
you would pick up in PC. With others, percentage wise it drops, but<br/>
again, with the abundance of mobs, that shouldnt matter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I took both of my clerics there and now their offensive and<br/>
defensive skills are maxed. Without the worry of aggro, its an awesome<br/>
place. I havent tried it, but with everything non-aggro there, one<br/>
could most likely fear kite in there. I.m not sure about quadding tho,<br/>
dont have the cahoneys to try that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At around level 53 or so, stuff will start to aggro you, so unless<br/>
you have good crowd control, this zone is no longer good solo. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, there is one way in and 2 ways out. 1) gate, or 2) speak to the<br/>
dude at zone in, tell him you wish to leave...and he will put his foot<br/>
to ur arse and zone you out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>

and I am trying to solo but wondering if I <br/>
&gt;  just have it wrong.  I spend more time medding than anything else.  <br/>
&gt;  What are some decent zones to attemp to solo at my lvl and what <br/>
&gt;  strageties do some of you higher lvl Shammies recommend I do?  I need <br/>
&gt;  to build my skills so MMs are OUT !!  PP is always nice but at this <br/>
&gt;  point not a necessity.  My Mana pool is at about 1186 and HP is about <br/>
&gt;  763 unbuffed.  Is that on par or do I need to update my equipment.  <br/>
