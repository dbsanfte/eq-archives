<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-384855434">I hear where you&#39;re coming from. As a druid, I sometimes have to heal, sometimes nuke, sometimes damage shield and DOT, but rarely, if ever, melee. So I run into the same problem of not being near the corpse when it dies and the group you&#39;re with is FFA. I really don&#39;t mind free for all loot, provided that everyone understands no one needs to get greedy. By the sound of it, you were hunting in Highkeep, a personal favorite of mine. Most groups that are not ffa usually go alphabetically and you keep looting until you get a total of 2pp, a bronze or FS weapon or armor, or some combination of ore (down in the warrior and raider rooms).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think any looting order is any better than others. I think it completely depends on the people you&#39;re grouped with. Some people can do the ffa loot and no one ever loots too much and it works smoothly. And in the alpha loot, as long as everyone&#39;s honest, that works well too.<br/>
<br/>
Cooperation is the key.<br/>

totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>
loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they care<br/>
about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>
&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>
chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>
still loot out of turn.<br/>
And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>
When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>
ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>
picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an expensive<br/>
item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>
bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>
for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
Just wondering.<br/>
luv,<br/>

ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>
people cooperate.<br/>
