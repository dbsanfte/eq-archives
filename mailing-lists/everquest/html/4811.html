<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827165870">Theres still an issue open with Lost dungeons that delevels you to level50<br/>
after you die. We have two guildies that had to be restored so I would<br/>
advice some caution with preordering lodn yet. (they couldnt loot much of<br/>
their gear haha).<br/>
<br/>
And yes, cancelling the subscription did not fix the problem, nor did<br/>
relogging to desktop which was the boradcaster resolution from the GM:s. As<br/>
of yesterday evening this problem still exists in some cases. <br/>
<br/>
Be careful...<br/>

Hi Donna!<br/>
I pre-ordered Lost Dungeons and so far nothing unusual has happened to me.<br/>
*knock on woodelf* I thought about cancelling and buying the CD but it would<br/>
just be one more thing to worry about from the post office. I like the idea<br/>
of it being $5 cheaper to buy the online version. luv, -Su<br/>

&gt;Be careful if your thinking of ordering Lost Dungeons of Norrath. <br/>
&gt;Theres<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all kinds of problems with it. A fellow Guildie pre &gt;ordered it and last<br/>
night when he got killed he deleveled 7 levels. Here&#39;s a link to the kind of<br/>
problems everyone is having.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  So.. Anyone pre-order Lost Dungeons of Norrath? And is anyone going to<br/>
wait<br/>
  to buy the storebought CD version that comes with a real life gift as well<br/>
  as an in-game gift of an 8 slot weight reduction bag for one character?<br/>
  luv,<br/>
