<div id="ygrps-yiv-972192074">The only time I have heard anything even similar is in a raid <br/>
situation where participants should go LFG so that they can be <br/>
placed in groups within the raid.  If you are in a zone with a raid <br/>
gathering, it might be related to that.  Since there are normally <br/>
lots of people in a small area, it might be hard to catch everyone.  <br/>
Usually people just say &quot;is there anyone still looking for a group&quot; <br/>
but I can see the &quot;looking for group check&quot; thing too...<br/>

&gt; This might be a silly question for those of you who are experts at <br/>
&gt; playing Everquest, but, I still have to ask it.  What does it mean <br/>
&gt; when a person shouts &quot;looking for group check&quot;?  I&#39;ve been playing <br/>
&gt; for just over a year and have never quite figured out if this <br/>
means <br/>
&gt; that the person is looking for new group members or if they are <br/>
&gt; acoounting for the members that are already in the group.  Just a <br/>
&gt; question from someone who simply does not know.<br/>

&gt; Thanks </span></blockquote></div>
