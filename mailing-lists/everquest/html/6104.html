<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Okay since I don&#39;t play WoW much, I had to log on 
to remember which realm I am in.&nbsp; I have a level 4 Night Elf druid named 
Raidowulf on the Lothar server.&nbsp; Personally, I don&#39;t like the night elf 
graphics.&nbsp; The ears are just way too big.&nbsp; Makes them look more like 
goblins.&nbsp; And the bodies look like they were drawn by the same people who 
did the He-Man cartoons.&nbsp; But the scenery graphics in game are pretty 
good.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Lol! I would have a hard time remember too if mine wasn&#39;t 
  at the top of the list.&nbsp; I used to be on dialup but my phonelines kept 
  deteriorating. When the bandwidth dropped under 10k we had to get satellite. 
  Once when it was raining and lost satellite I dialed up but was only at 6.2k. 
  On a later attempt the bandwidth was too low to even dialup at all. The phone 
  company denies there is anything wrong with the lines so we can&#39;t get them to 
  do anythign about it. So we are completely on satellite now. It&#39;s supposed to 
  be about 800k dl speed and 50k upload. However, they tend to cap usage if you 
  load more than a certain amount. Because of the delay with the satellite 
  signal I get over 800ms ping. I pretty much average around 3kms. It makes 
  things tough in WoW, but it&#39;s still doable. Death in WoW is easier to deal 
  with than death in EQ. I kinda wish EQ would change it so you no longer lost 
  xp on death, but I doubt they will. I would be willing to sacrifice some cash 
  for armor repair or such <br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>====== At 2005-03-02, 02:42:00

  newbie here<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On EQ2 I am on Crushbone 
  server.&nbsp; On EQ I am on Cazic Thule server so I went with whatever &quot;C&quot; 
  named server EQ2 had.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as lag, are you 
  on dialup?&nbsp; I had a lot of lag on EQ2 when I first started it, but I 
  built a new system and now it runs fine.&nbsp; Definitely need a nice system 
  to run it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
