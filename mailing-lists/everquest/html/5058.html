<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872826450">We bought the expansion for some of the features, rather than any<br/>
plans to go there. However, since we got the new computer, I have been<br/>
thinking of someday making the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Trouble is, I don&#39;t know how to get there. Granted, I haven&#39;t yet<br/>
tried, but when I look on some of the EQ sites I visit, I don&#39;t see<br/>
any way to get there. Is there a boat? From where? Is it even worth<br/>
going there?<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t even gone to Jagged Pines since we got a machine that makes<br/>
the zone playable. In fact, I need to visit lots of places. I have<br/>
only limited experience on Luclin due to the lag. Been working Crystal<br/>
Caverns this last week, my first week on the new machine.<br/>
