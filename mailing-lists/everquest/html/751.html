<div id="ygrps-yiv-640020101">Yup... Both have cracked staves (he recently &quot;swapped&quot; his for one an<br/>
Orc had just in case his was &quot;faulty&quot; - lol), same &quot;skin like wood&quot;<br/>
buff - in fact mine wears off and I often forget to put it back on.<br/>
:o/   I gave him some of my armor, making his AC higher than mine, and<br/>
then he went and bought some more (I haven&#39;t heard the end of that<br/>
one, yet... :oP ) and *still* he&#39;s hitting for these puny amounts and<br/>
missing a lot (and therefore getting hit more often himself).  I told<br/>
him to make a new character and see if he advances better with that<br/>
one, but he doesn&#39;t *want* a new character ::whine whine::.  We&#39;re<br/>
only lvl 6, it&#39;s not like it would take forever to work his way back<br/>
up to it.  Oh, well, he&#39;ll survive...or not.  :)  Thanks!<br/>

&gt;Are you also using the same equipment and weapons? Also buffs have alot to do with it, if you have a strength buff you will harder and more often...<br/>

&gt;&gt; My husband and I play EQ on a networked setup.  We created our<br/>
&gt;&gt; characters at the same time, we&#39;re both Wood Elf Druids.  We<br/>
&gt;&gt; distributed our extra 30 stat points the same.  We group most of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; time so level just about the same time.  We even have the same AC and<br/>
&gt;&gt; HP within a couple of points.<br/>
