<br/>
&gt; Well, when I first talked to the EQ people about having different eye<br/>
&gt; colors, hair styles, and hair colors they told me that they would never be<br/>
&gt; able to do it bc it was too complex. Now they do have it. It just depends<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the programming advances they make.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, going by what they&#39;ve said in the past, never gonna happen.<br/>
&gt; If adding ONE model (Iksar skellie pets for Iksar necros and SKs) sucks up<br/>
&gt; too much resources and would require too much  recoding to be feasible,<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; adding seperate, interchangable parts like taller collars or optional<br/>
horns<br/>
&gt; for helms would likely fall under the same limitations.<br/>

&gt;   Another thing I&#39;d think would be cool is a feature that relates to the<br/>
&gt; armor dyes..molding, and tailoring any piece of gear you own to your own<br/>
&gt; liking.   Like say if you were a ogre warrior and you didn&#39;t like the way<br/>
&gt; your helmet looked like, well you could go down to a forge or blacksmith<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; pay a certain amount to have them mold the helmet anyway you would<br/>
&gt; like..maybe you would like horns on the helmet or a certain design ecthed<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; it..and for casters you could go to a tailor somewhere and have them<br/>
design<br/>
&gt; your robe a certain way..maybe you would like longer sleeves or a slit in<br/>
&gt; your robe or a fancy collar.<br/>
