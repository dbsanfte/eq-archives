<div><font color="#800000">I&#39;m 36, my hubby is 32, our friends that we play with 
every day are 32, 26, 44, and 54. (We all work together during the day and then 
group up in EQ at nite and weekends. =)&nbsp; We also have a second group that 
we interchange players with....my sis-in-law and her friends..all ages 
21-24.&nbsp; I&#39;ve found on Kane Bayle the average age is much higher than on 
some of the more populated servers.&nbsp; And yes, it&#39;s a European server, but 
we&#39;re all Americans.....&nbsp;By much higher I guess there just doesn&#39;t seem to 
be as many very young teens or kids on there.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; Then again maybe 
those Europeans are just better behaved! ;)&nbsp; LOL</font></div>
