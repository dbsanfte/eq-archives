<div><font size="2">True that. I went with Sygate originally bc I only had 2 
machines linked with a crossover cable, then kept it when I switched to a hub 
and eventually a switch as things progressed. At the time it was one good, solid 
stable machine that was on all the time and had a reliable, fast dialup modem, 
and a second that was only on when I was using it, and had a fussy, slower 
modem...but better overall hardware for EQ. Over time the original LAN server 
has just been tweaked to keep up with each change, like switching from dialup to 
DSL. With it being Win98, it didn&#39;t have ICS, and from what I&#39;m told ICS gets 
stupid at times, so I went with Sygate...if nothing else, it got the job done 
then, and gets it done just as well now. I wouldn&#39;t recommend making your setup 
any more complicated than needed, as that just means more chance of something 
f&#39;in up....but if you don&#39;t like ICS or it doesn&#39;t work quite right and you&#39;d 
rather opt for the cheaper hub or switch, then Sygate might be perfect for you. 
There&#39;s a month free trial, so you have a decent chance to see if it meets your 
needs and likes your setup. </font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yeah I supose you could do that with a standard 
  networking hub, but best bet is to go with a router.&nbsp; Usually doesn&#39;t 
  require any extra software, it&#39;s easy to configure, and most of them have 
  built in firewalls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ve never heard of SyGate, but Windows 
  ME/XP both have something called Internet Connection sharing which essentially 
  sets up a proxy server ont he host machine and allows all the others to 
  connect through it.&nbsp; I used it before and its okay but a little 
  tempermental at times when you start adding 3rd party firewall software to the 
  mix.&nbsp; I&#39;d still reccomend going with a router.&nbsp; Small 4 port routers 
  aren&#39;t that expensive.&nbsp; You can pick them up at Best buy or Comp USA for 
  less than $60.&nbsp; Just make sure you know what you&#39;re getting.</font></div>

    <div><br></div><tt>Yes. I have 5 on a single connection, myself. One is 
    directly connected to<br>the DSL, and runs a program called Sygate which 
    shares the connection to the<br>other machines. It has a special 
    configuration package for EQ, but worked<br>fine without it, for me, so try 
    working without it first. If you have any<br>trouble with it, email me, it 
    has a few rare but known issues that can be<br>hard to diagnose but are 
    pretty easy to fix.<br>----- Original Message -----<br>From: STG2 Pierce

    AM<br>Subject: [EverQuest] Computer Question<br><br><br>&gt; Hello everyone 
    I have question for you guys.&nbsp; Now before I start off I am<br>&gt; just 
    starting to learn the hardware side of computers so bear with me 
    lol,<br>&gt; now my question is what items would be needed in order to have 
    3 computers<br>&gt; share 1 DSL line?&nbsp; When I get back I&#39;m gonna buy a 
    laptop and have one of<br>my<br>&gt; friends move in with me so we&#39;ll have 3 
    computers total on 1 DSL line<br>thats<br>&gt; the reason why I ask this 
    question.&nbsp; Thanks for any help you guys can give<br>&gt; 
    me.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Dabruiser Troll<br>&gt; Warrior of the 29th
