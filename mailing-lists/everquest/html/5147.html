<div id="ygrps-yiv-242283509">The stone is not acqiured in your home city.  You must talk to one of the <br/>
NPCs in one of the recruiter camps.  Alakazam&#39;s has the names of the npcs in <br/>
each camp that you can talk to to get the stone. You area sked a series of <br/>
questions that area about the LDoN expansion.<br/>

I&#39;m hoping someone can remind me about this... I got the LDoN message about<br/>
who to speak to for the adventure stone when I was level 16, and since I <br/>
wasn&#39;t<br/>
at 20 yet, I didn&#39;t do it. Now that I&#39;m at 22, I can&#39;t remember who it was I<br/>
was supposed to talk to. Who is the person in Halas that gives you the <br/>
stone?<br/>
