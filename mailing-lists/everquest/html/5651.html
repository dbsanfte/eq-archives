&gt; I logged in for a second the other night and noticed<br/>
&gt; that the characters look a little more &quot;real&quot; now, and<br/>
&gt; the stars in the sky are a nice touch. But I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; able to do any real playing, just wandered around on<br/>
&gt; an alt for a few minutes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After reading all this though, I&#39;m not sure if I want<br/>
&gt; to try and play, hehe. Maybe I&#39;ll wait a few more<br/>
&gt; weeks... or months...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Yea the new graphics are great, the skys fabulous, but the probs continue.<br/>
Just today i fell through the earth but they added a new feature thats<br/>
supposed to detect that and drop you at a safe point in the zone.  Dont know<br/>
what else they are adding as a &quot;safety net&quot; type moves, but at least they<br/>
are working on keeping us alive and moving till they get them fixed. </span></blockquote></div>
