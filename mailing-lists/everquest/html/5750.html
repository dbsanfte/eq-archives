<div id="ygrps-yiv-500133810">I have been looking at a lot of guides that claim to help you hack or cheat<br/>
at Everquest.  While each one is a little different they all have some<br/>
things in common.  They claim there is an e-mail address that was set up by<br/>
Sony then forgotten about.  If you send an e-mail to this address with<br/>
certain codes in it you can modify your character.  The messages go into a<br/>
lot of detail listing all the codes, what they do, and how to use them.  In<br/>
order to make sure the cheat works on your character you need to include<br/>
your Station username and password in the e-mail.  I should not have to say<br/>
any more but just in case you don&#39;t get it, whoever runs the e-mail address<br/>
is sure not Sony, its a loser who wants to steal your account.  Never e-mail<br/>
your password to anyone!<br/>
<br/>
The Plat guides I have looked at are all way out of date.  None of them have<br/>
mentioned POK or how the Bazzar has made many of the methods they describe<br/>
obsolete.  They also claim you can make 100plat or more an hour with a level<br/>
1 character, what they don&#39;t say is that you first need to spend a number of<br/>
hours maxing out that characters trade skills and that your char will need<br/>
some plat in advance to pull it off.  I really did not see anything that I<br/>
did not already know from reading EQtraders or other websites.<br/>
<br/>
I also found a secret way to get into EQII beta!  Just send you username and<br/>
password to this secret e-mail address...</div>
