<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107080220">I popped into West Commons my last two sessions to see if I could bag <br/>
a giant. Just wanted to come back to the zone and do that, since now <br/>
I can. The place is so empty! Back when I was a teen it was busy, <br/>
laggy and fun. It is deserted now.<br/>
<br/>
I have to wonder, are there very few real noobs these days? Has POP <br/>
changed the demographics in Norath? Places that were good fun and <br/>
fellowship are dead. Even Velious is starting to seem empty. Are all <br/>
of the players getting into the high levels and now living in the <br/>
Planes?<br/>
