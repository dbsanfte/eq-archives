<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383631801">This might be a little late, heh. I just got my P4 1.8ghz system in the other day and have been busy playing with that. EQ runs awesome on it too. Anyway, now I&#39;m playing catch-up on the e-mails....<br/>
<br/>

Very good suggestions from the others. I haven&#39;t seen an answer if those worked for you or not. If it did, great! If not tho, you might want to head on over to the EQ tech forums, as this topic has been brought up lots of times over there, and do a search of that forum for &quot;linksys&quot; or something similar. You should come up with a number of threads you can read through for various possible solutions. Good luck!<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Network setup help<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m hoping that someone on this board can help.  I just installed an<br/>
&gt; at home network with an ethernet DSL modem, 2 computers and a LinkSys<br/>
&gt; router (with switch built in).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For some reason, the router seems to be making me disconnect from EQ<br/>
&gt; VERY frequently!  9 or 10 times a night!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I unplugged the router and just plugged the computer into the modem<br/>
&gt; and everything worked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions on how I can get this network going?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
