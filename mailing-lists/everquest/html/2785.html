<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767310116">I agree as far as not pl on first characters. Important game skills <br/>
are aquired through solo and group leveling.<br/>
<br/>
PL is valuable for some alternate characters. How many times must one <br/>
spend endless hours killing spiders? If your plan for your alt is <br/>
more than just experiencing EQ from a different class perspective, pl <br/>
can be a legitimate gaming tool.<br/>

&gt; Don&#39;t be afraid to ask someone to pl you?? Sorry I do not agree <br/>
with that. Do not ask for pl....do it yourself. Being power leveled <br/>
makes for bad players with low skills. Do it yourself with <br/>
groups,etc....<br/>
