<div id="ygrps-yiv-41726976">I agree and understsand most of this but what or how<br/>
does a ranger aggro control?<br/>
<br/>
Mine is 18 and I find it a little tough getting exp<br/>
right now.  High Pass Hold is always too busy.  I am<br/>
trying Sk with the KFC birds but as you said, I need a<br/>
good tank and healer since anything higher than a<br/>
Darkter wastes me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; I have to respond to this.  While it is true that<br/>
&gt; Rangers don&#39;t have the hitpoints of Paladins,<br/>
&gt; Shadowknights, and Warriors (even with the same gear<br/>
&gt; and stats).  You have to keep in mind, that Rangers<br/>
&gt; are not tanks (well, at least not post 25ish), but<br/>
&gt; are more in the line of a light offensive class,<br/>
&gt; with excellent agro control.  It is true that they<br/>
&gt; do not have as high of an AC as a pure tank, Pally,<br/>
&gt; or SK, due to the fact that there is very little in<br/>
&gt; the way of plate armor that they can wear.  As far<br/>
&gt; as soloability, they are the most efficient melee<br/>
&gt; based class for soloing, even prior to getting panic<br/>
&gt; animal at 22.  I know this is true, as other than<br/>
&gt; from 12 to 15, and 21 to 25, I have just about<br/>
&gt; exclusively soloed mine (and very little of it has<br/>
&gt; been on animals).  I&#39;ve even grouped with a higher<br/>
&gt; level Ogre warrior (i was 40, he was 45), and peeled<br/>
&gt; the mob off of him for a time, due to the healer<br/>
&gt; being lom, and held it til the ogre got healed.  If<br/>
&gt; The Ranger in your group is dying a lot, then one<br/>
&gt; (or more) of several things is true:  either the MT<br/>
&gt; is not doing his job with damage and taunt, the<br/>
&gt; ranger is not doing efficient agro control, the<br/>
&gt; healer is not keeping up with the damage done, or<br/>
&gt; the ranger has not focused as much on AC as he/she<br/>
&gt; should have.<br/>

&gt;   Yeah they seem like they would be really good in<br/>
&gt; the high end game. I think they are kind of hard to<br/>
&gt; play in groups though as they don&#39;t have many hit<br/>
&gt; points and die a lot. <br/>

&gt;     &gt; A ranger is a tough class to play. I played<br/>
&gt; one to 40, I don&#39;t recommend<br/>
&gt;     it,<br/>
&gt;     &gt; I think they stink, but they are good for<br/>
&gt; fooling around with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Rangers aren&#39;t tough to play at all.  While htey<br/>
&gt; are group dependant until<br/>
&gt;     they get Panic Animal at 22, they are excellent<br/>
&gt; characters in teh high end<br/>
&gt;     game.  There aren&#39;t too many classes that can do<br/>
&gt; the damage they can AND<br/>
&gt;     still be able to control aggro as well they do. <br/>
&gt; And they are the masters of<br/>
&gt;     outdoor pulling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     &gt; There are characters that you use for the high<br/>
&gt; end game, and characters<br/>
&gt;     used<br/>
&gt;     &gt; just for fooling around and making money, and<br/>
&gt; characters used for their<br/>
&gt;     sheer power.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     And well, any class can fill any of these roles.<br/>
