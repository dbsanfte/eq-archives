<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Geforce 4 MX vs Geforce 4 Ti <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008412225">I saw the Ti for sale in Babbages but still like my MX enough that I&#39;ll wait<br/>
before the Ti goes down in price. I also heard horror stories about people<br/>
who ordered the Ti from Best Buy bc Best Buy was offering a really low price<br/>
(they basically mixed the price up with another card but didn&#39;t correct the<br/>
error until it was too late). They refused to ship the item after already<br/>
billing the customers. Customers had to file paperwork or call their credit<br/>
card companies to get their money back. In one particularly nasty case Best<br/>
Buy had a guy arrested when he tried to pick up his card that he had<br/>
purchased online from a store. They claimed he was trying to defraud the<br/>
store and called the police. Pretty crappy eh?<br/>
Ok, that&#39;s my rant for the day.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have played with both cards and I thought the Geforce 4 Ti made things<br/>
 </span></blockquote>look better than the &gt;MX. The 4 MX seems to basically be a 2 MX, just faster<br/>
and more memory. I may take back my &gt;MX and get the Ti, the day that I spent<br/>
with that card was the most enjoyable day I ever spent in &gt;EQ.</div>
