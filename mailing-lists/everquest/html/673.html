<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005246326">Hehe you wanna know something? I&#39;m going to join Scarlet Horizon, but before I can join I have to do this quest, and Galihad said my quest was to get GhoulBane hehehe(btw Elayna ROCKS!:)<br/>
<br/>
I camped ghoulbane more yesterday, ended with a total of 11 hours, and the shin lord didn&#39;t spawn once, talk about bad luck, statistically he should pop once every 4 spawns(A GM agreed on this number) and he managed to beat the odds by not showing up for over 35 spawns, we should have seen the lord about 9 times hehe.. DOOOOH!!!(Homer style)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gonna keep trying, don&#39;t have much choice, but I&#39;ve been going to bed at 9am for about 2 weeks trying to get this bloody sword now, it&#39;s wearing me down hehe..<br/>
