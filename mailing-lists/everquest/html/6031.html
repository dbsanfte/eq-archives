&gt; <br/>
&gt; However this doesn&#39;t work for everyone AND trying to<br/>
&gt; get someone to PL <br/>
&gt; you is a whole nother adventure in itself! Another<br/>
&gt; question I have for <br/>
&gt; you is what type of armor did you start out with?<br/>
&gt; Were you twinked?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not trying to rip on you or put you down for<br/>
&gt; getting PL&#39;d but what I <br/>
&gt; am saying here is not everyone can go this route.<br/>
&gt; You offer a great way <br/>
&gt; to do it but again not everyone can do this. Now<br/>
&gt; with EQ2 out and all <br/>
&gt; the ubers moving over to it, you hardly ever find<br/>
&gt; any on anymore and <br/>
&gt; those that are don&#39;t want to waste their time with a<br/>
&gt; lowbie when the <br/>
&gt; camp they have been trying to get access to for the<br/>
&gt; past 3 months to <br/>
&gt; finish their epic is now free. Plus not everyone has<br/>
&gt; all the expans yet <br/>
&gt; and may not be able to get to some of those zones<br/>
&gt; you mention. Not to <br/>
&gt; mention the time to play. Not everyone has 4 days<br/>
&gt; they can play. I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; lucky I can get 1 full day half the time! Again I<br/>
&gt; congradulate you on <br/>
&gt; your achievements.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now for those that are really that desperate (and<br/>
&gt; stupid enough to give <br/>
&gt; full access to their account to a perfect stranger),<br/>
&gt; you can try this <br/>
&gt; out! <br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: power lvling 101<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; the ends and out about power lvling is simple. get<br/>
&gt; temp from a <br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric, get a druid. druid casts regn, str, damage<br/>
&gt; shield, sow. goto <br/>
&gt; &gt; field of bone hit mob once move on, kill anything<br/>
&gt; that walks away. <br/>
&gt; &gt; make sure druid is healing you. lvl 12 goto kurns<br/>
&gt; tower ( off field <br/>
&gt; &gt; of bone ). kill in kurns tower to lvl 20 or intill<br/>
&gt; something looks <br/>
&gt; &gt; green or light blue. goto paludal caverns lvl<br/>
&gt; there the same way hit <br/>
&gt; &gt; mob once and move on. work your way to back<br/>
&gt; tunnels and kill <br/>
&gt; &gt; shrinkens once there light  blue take the camps at<br/>
&gt; zone in. from Here <br/>
&gt; &gt; you should be well on your way and zone choice can<br/>
&gt; be done by you or <br/>
&gt; &gt; the druid.  Paw is mine it is getting nerfed soon.<br/>
&gt;  I can lvl there <br/>
&gt; &gt; till late 35 or so. You could also goto into<br/>
&gt; Crystal Caverns at 30 <br/>
&gt; &gt; for power lvling. Usualy by the time iam lvl 40<br/>
&gt; the druid is sick of <br/>
&gt; &gt; lvling me and i solo dawn shroud peak has zelnicks<br/>
&gt; thay are cake for <br/>
&gt; &gt; a power lvled twinked player least it hasnt failed<br/>
&gt; me. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; for you who say spells spells spells. have<br/>
&gt; powerlvled warrior, monk, <br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric, enchanter, rogue, all to lvl 40. then<br/>
&gt; soloed 40-50 and my <br/>
&gt; &gt; skills where maxed from soloing. the coin you get<br/>
&gt; plus the 5 points <br/>
&gt; &gt; each lvl you can easly bring skills up spells to<br/>
&gt; comp you at lvl 40 <br/>
&gt; &gt; to get by. each class has a main spell class bring<br/>
&gt; it and evocation <br/>
&gt; &gt; up.  and the rest come in short order. I have only<br/>
&gt; seen one person <br/>
&gt; &gt; power lvled so hard he couldnt cast. But normaly<br/>
&gt; you will work <br/>
&gt; &gt; something up it does take time. and your melee<br/>
&gt; skills will be maxed, <br/>
&gt; &gt; if not close, my rogue i just started not only<br/>
&gt; maxed pierceing but <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1hs as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  You may not want or like power lvling how ever i<br/>
&gt; see nothing wrong <br/>
&gt; &gt; with pling to 40 soloing to 50 before i begain my<br/>
&gt; grouping career. <br/>
&gt; &gt; todayes game has drop gear cheap to make an old<br/>
&gt; school 65 war on a 40 <br/>
&gt; &gt; war. so grping with people at lvls below 55 are<br/>
&gt; slaying the mobs. its <br/>
&gt; &gt; not like it was when the game came out, and grps<br/>
&gt; realy did need <br/>
&gt; &gt; players below 55 to play well. even my rouge can<br/>
&gt; tank still at 46. <br/>
&gt; &gt; dont sweat lvl 70 because you not going to get<br/>
&gt; there in a day. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;     lvl 46 rogue in 4 days played less than two<br/>
&gt; weeks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
