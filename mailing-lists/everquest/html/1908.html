<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768295335">I have too....eq has been untouched since I bought it, even though I had to <br/>
go get a 128mg memory card yesterday cause 64 just couldn&#39;t play it. Another <br/>
plus for me....the eq music, I have never heard..my sound card can&#39;t handle <br/>
it, so we have to disable it to play eq, but daoc&#39;s music plays just fine <br/>
with my crappy sound card lol.....I made a seer and love the fact that she <br/>
crits!  a caster that can crit? I love it! Take everything good about eq, <br/>
and you have daoc...there are a problem or 2, but thats to be expected....eq <br/>
had many more probs I hear ( I only started eq a year ago) so I am fully <br/>
pleased with my 40 bucks for the game (plus 35 for the memory card lol) its <br/>
worth it to me.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not cancelling eq...hubby still plays and I have some friends who <br/>
won&#39;t convert hehehe<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been playing DAoC as well.  I think you&#39;re right in that they&#39;ve built <br/>
&gt;on EQ and are better, much in the same way that EQ was better than UO when <br/>
&gt;it came out.  I figure that we&#39;re all consumers and we play the best game.  <br/>
&gt;It&#39;s nice to have the marketplace competition as each game tries to outdo <br/>
&gt;the other.  There&#39;s nothing wrong or disloyal in switching RPGs, and there <br/>
&gt;will be nothing wrong with switching back if/when EQ revamps itself.<br/>

&gt;   I must say that I too have made the switch, haven&#39;t touched EQ since <br/>
&gt;DAoC came out.  Dark Age has had the benefit of hindsight and learning from <br/>
&gt;EQ&#39;s mistakes.  They have built upon them.  There is less downtime, more <br/>
&gt;character specialization, less annoying corpse runs, better graphics, <br/>
&gt;easier grouping, and better pvp.  DAoC is better than EQ currently, <br/>
&gt;however, to EQ&#39;s credit -- Dark Age wouldn&#39;t be what it is if it hadn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;been for EQ&#39;s experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   If you like EQ, I think you&#39;ll like Dark Age if not as much, perhaps <br/>
&gt;better.  The only drawback is that you need a pretty high-end system for <br/>
&gt;smooth play (particularly a good graphics card).<br/>

&gt;     My husband has been playing it.  In fact, after a few days, he <br/>
&gt;cancelled his EQ account and is solely playing DAoC.  He keeps telling me <br/>
&gt;to try it but I tell him I like EQ just fine.  From watching him, I can <br/>
&gt;tell I don&#39;t wanna play.  BUT he&#39;s a hardcore gamer and EQ and Solitaire <br/>
&gt;are the only games I play.  He says it&#39;s like EQ but better.<br/>
