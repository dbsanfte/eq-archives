<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076524512">Has anyone heard the news lately about EverQuest? They said that millions of <br/>
people play this game daily, and there have been many suicides brought on by <br/>
it. They also said people become obsessed and make the game their <br/>
life...they don&#39;t get jobs or do anything else, just play all the time. My <br/>
parents are now concerned and told me as soon as they see any signs that I <br/>
am going to kill myself, they are taking the game away. I can&#39;t believe <br/>
that...the game is fun, yeah, but to end your life over it? Come on.<br/>
