<div id="ygrps-yiv-838875818">I find that if you approach PL&#39;ers nicely they may be willing to <br/>
hrough a few descent buffs your way. And it gives you a chance to <br/>
level much quicker. Typically people beng PL&#39;d already have high <br/>
level characters and are simply getting help in order to supplement <br/>
their guild with a different race so they can go on more afective <br/>
raids. <br/>
<br/>
I created a Ranger and spent the last 2 years getting him to 35. Then <br/>
I created a dwarf rogue and PL&#39;d him to 35 so that I could join a <br/>
guild that frowned on Rangers, once I was in the Ranger tagged along. <br/>
Soon after that I got another account and created a druid which was <br/>
played by myself and friends of mine, essentially PL&#39;ing it to mid <br/>
40&#39;s so that I could run my Ranger and Rogue around with gates (my <br/>
son has several characters on both accounts that he uses as well, <br/>
none PL&#39;d). <br/>
<br/>
As for the integrity aspect of it, thats a matter of opinion. Since  <br/>
when I am PL&#39;ing I am more interested in the level over the goods, <br/>
noob&#39;s benefit since I give away 90% of what I get. My guild <br/>
benefits, since we have a more diverse membership (who wants a guild <br/>
full of bloody druids anyway?). However I don&#39;t believe that high <br/>
level characters should be allowed to camp out a noob location to <br/>
benefit just their friends. They should show alot more nobility and <br/>
class by assisting any others that may be fighting in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents worth<br/>

&gt; Mmm... it&#39;s true that the peopel who are getting PLed are not doing <br/>
&gt; much work.  They level faster than people who actually level <br/>
&gt; themselves.  I understand how you would think this is not really <br/>
fair <br/>
&gt; but sometimes people like to help others.  When I help people, I PL <br/>
&gt; them.  I won&#39;t help them get equipment because that&#39;s what you need <br/>
&gt; to do for yourself since it generally makes you more powerful <br/>
&gt; especially magical items.  AND when I PL them, I don&#39;t take over <br/>
&gt; camps to help them level.  I just look around for roaming mobs that <br/>
&gt; are not a RARE of course and let them kill it.  Heal them when <br/>
&gt; necessary.  The usual method.  I don&#39;t steal camps from people or <br/>
&gt; camp things when tyring to PL &#39;em.  I know that&#39;s wrong cuz if I <br/>
did <br/>
&gt; that I would feel like I&#39;m hogging the camp since I wouldn&#39;t get xp <br/>
&gt; in the first place and it&#39;s a camp that everyone wants to have.  <br/>
For <br/>
&gt; example, PLing in cb.  I just look for any orcs i see and let them <br/>
&gt; kill it.  There are hardly any camps in there.  The only camps <br/>
there <br/>
&gt; are in cb are in the castle itself and near the tents.  Anyway, my <br/>
&gt; point is, is that I find it wrong when people take over camps to PL <br/>
&gt; but I find it ok when people just kill roaming mobs to PL.  AND <br/>
yeah, <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like when peopel twink.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t give peopel <br/>
&gt; equipment or money.  Maybe leather armor but that&#39;s about it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Opinions vary. I personally find the whole power leveling idea to <br/>
&gt; be most<br/>
&gt; &gt; dishonorable. To see an orc camp taken over by a 50+ druid and a <br/>
lv <br/>
&gt; 6 ogre<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer reminds me how people <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; have no<br/>
&gt; &gt; willingness to work for things (the whole cheat code thing). But <br/>
&gt; many people<br/>
&gt; &gt; find it ok to twink/power level and, well, so be it. I can see <br/>
it, <br/>
&gt; shiver,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and keep moving. Live and let live. I am fortunate that at lv 43 <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; can solo<br/>
&gt; &gt; and this is only an inconvience at worse to me instead of a real <br/>
&gt; issue. But<br/>
&gt; &gt; up until lv 35 I was still having camps stolen from me by uber <br/>
&gt; twinks and<br/>
&gt; &gt; anon druids.<br/>
