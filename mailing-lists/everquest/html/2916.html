<div id="ygrps-yiv-781478454">Cool! I&#39;ve been doing cured silk and studded armor. My smithing is good<br/>
enough to make the studs pretty well. I just have a hard time getting all<br/>
the silks and pelts.<br/>
Wish there was something I could make with ruined pelts that wasn&#39;t trivial<br/>
at this point. I have a ton of them.<br/>
Oh well, I&#39;ll have to look it up. Thanks!<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; no, there isn&#39;t a real guide on tailoring, yet, but you don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; need a special guide on that, because just have a look at eqtraders,<br/>
&gt; check the recipes and trade supplies sections. try to find something<br/>
&gt; with components that are easy to get, and are 10 to 50 above your<br/>
&gt; current skill. most of the time you will end up doing cured silk (up<br/>
&gt; to 82 i think) and wu&#39;s armor afterwards (that&#39;s up to 158).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; then put on your INT (for learning skills faster) and WIS (reducing<br/>
&gt; failures) gear. why to reduce failures with the WIS gear, to get back<br/>
&gt; some of the expenses you have. maybe add some CHA buffs as well, and<br/>
&gt; sell in a town where they like you ... ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; also try to find things that are stackable (components or results)<br/>
&gt; because you can do more in a given time if you don&#39;t have to sell<br/>
&gt; things to a merchant every four pieces you made. if you need<br/>
&gt; components from different vendors, try to find a town (or place)<br/>
&gt; where such merchants are close to each other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; also check out the new recipes that were added with the last patch,<br/>
&gt; there are much more things to choose from ... main problem with the<br/>
&gt; new ones: not all trivals are listed/known, yet, but you can make<br/>
&gt; others happy if you find &quot;unknown&quot; trivals and post them on eqtraders.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; another thing: don&#39;t even think about pieces that need a 200 skill.<br/>
&gt; those recipes need rare drop or very expensive components. and this<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t good to raise a tradeskill in a short time.<br/>
