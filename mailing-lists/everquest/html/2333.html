<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360132688">I hear for a necro in wide open spaces you can snare/fear and sick your pet<br/>
on some mobs.<br/>
Well, I pretty much watched a necro do that. :-)<br/>

Hit skyfire, you won&#39;t have any problems to solo your way up to 60 here if<br/>
you can&#39;t find groups. Just fear kite (read some about what mobs you should<br/>
focus on for each level).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome to EQ!  Your life will never be the same.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Having never played a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pally, here are some general thoughts:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; #1 DOn&#39;t feel rushed to get your first character up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to higher levels.  EQ is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a huge place and there is so much to do and see.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you take your time you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will have a much better experience, IMHO!  (I played<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my Ranger for a year<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and he only reached 27).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok, and how often did you play? and and what really<br/>
&gt; &gt; took you that long?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Honestly man, what were you doing all that time?<br/>
<br/>
My Ranger has recently reached 33 after almost 18 months of play.<br/>
I&#39;d say I am sometimes casual, sometimes intense.  Just depends.  I<br/>
spent a lot of time making deliveries for friends, helping out<br/>
lowbies and such, and just wandering around.  That is what Rangers<br/>
are supposed to do, right?<br/>
