<b>Subject:</b> A great EQ site I just noticed... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582749377">I am in no way associated with this site, but I was so impressed with the<br/>
content and message board style I thought I&#39;d pass it on.  *WARNING* There<br/>
is information on here that some people would consider spoilers so be<br/>
careful where you click... However, I think the majority of people would<br/>
greatly appreciate the info on this site. The message board has a great<br/>
format that I haven&#39;t seen before, but not a lot of traffic.  The people<br/>
who are there are pretty knowledgeable and willing to answer, and I &#39;ve yet<br/>
to see anything remotely approaching a flame.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to check it out, the address is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gameznet.com/eq/">http://gameznet.com/eq/</a><br/>
<br/>
The message board is &quot;base&quot; on the menu...<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m not in any way associated with the site so I wouldn&#39;t call this<br/>
advertising. It&#39;s just that many of the questions I see people ask that are<br/>
game-mechanic related, rather than development issue related, have answers<br/>
on this site....<br/>
