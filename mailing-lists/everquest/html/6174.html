friend)</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">AS long as I have played EQ (Starting with my 
original main Cynfyn back in August of 2k1) I have seen a lot of things change 
and a lot of things stay the same.&nbsp; EQ1 in its current state with the 
latest expansion has a lot to&nbsp; offer for everyone who can get it but like 
Greg said there is still stuff in the old world expansions that have yet to be 
seen by myself and even my guild.&nbsp; And i am still learning new things 
within the game whether it be from a veteran player and sometimes even a genuine 
newbie has some useful input that I had not known previously.&nbsp; I have 
roughly 5&nbsp; or 6 accounts that i rotate out on a case by case basis with 
EQ&nbsp;when i want to play something different&nbsp;&nbsp;with My Shaman&#39;s 
account being the center of them all since he is my main&nbsp; now.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Currently my&nbsp; line up&nbsp; is Haly (70 Barb shaman)&nbsp; yzural (65 Iksar 
monk) Tennyson (62 High Elf Chanter) and Daygone (55 cleric) and learning 
seriously how to&nbsp; hydra 4 chars (Thank&nbsp;the Powers that be &nbsp;for 
WinEQ 2.0 Pro)&nbsp; but with each char I learn stuff that I can use for when i 
am ready to get all 4 chars in a raid and still be able to keep up and not fall 
behind.&nbsp; I may once I get the hang of running all 4 together pull out 
Cynfyn (52 DE SK) and use him as&nbsp; another melee hydra then maybe&nbsp; get 
my Druid (Ridejta currently lvl 36) out of moth balls as well and get him 
leveled up to where I can hydra all my chars&nbsp; as my own personal little 
army =)</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">But the point is EQ1 as long as it is still there 
is gonna&nbsp; the only one that i will mainly play.&nbsp; I recently signed 
up&nbsp; for the trial version of EQ2 and created a Barb Priest named after 
my&nbsp; Barb Shammy (Halyburton) and I&#39;ve already reached the level cap of 6 in 
that game with Haly jr since i only have the trial.&nbsp; I may or may not 
subscribe to EQ2 but i have a char there in case i ever decide I want a break 
form EQ1&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes EQ1 has some issues that SOE will eventually 
get to resolving&nbsp; that just makes peeps so frustrated that they hoot and 
holler in the chat areas at the GM&#39;s that are there.&nbsp;.&nbsp; They complain 
about it in all the various message boards dedicated to EQ&nbsp; heck the recent 
uproar that SoE was nerfing the Panther line of Spells&nbsp; on we Shaman is 
still yet IMHO and some other shammy&#39;s, but eventually stuff like that will one 
day be resolved.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">back in the days when Verant was in charge of EQ1 
production we had ggogles of GM&#39;s running rampant&nbsp; around Norrath where 
cheaters and such managed to get caught.&nbsp; I should Know cause Cynfyn was 
put on a forced hiatus cause someone hacked into my account and Blatantly used 
some kind of Cheat program right in front of a GM.&nbsp; I would love to see 
Special Holiday events like the Halloween event that got cynfyn killed so many 
times in Rathe Mountains it wasn&#39;t funny at&nbsp; the time cause everytime&nbsp; 
he got rezzed it happened to be a spot where Halloween event mobs either spawned 
or were trained too (lol its funny now but wasn&#39;t then)&nbsp; but its stuff like 
that that makes EQ1 such a great memory creator.&nbsp; Friends who have long 
since left EQ cause of RL stuff&nbsp; Returning friends who came back&nbsp; 
because of the new stuff , New friend you make&nbsp; with the server merges and 
totally brand new people to EQ1 who come up to you cause they see a higher level 
char of thier class who practically hang on every word you speak that will help 
them make the game more enjoyable.. It&#39;s Stuff like this that&nbsp; I am sure 
will keep the Flagship of SoE&#39;s gaming genre around for however many years it 
will remain.&nbsp; Will it remain for only a couple of years? 25? 100? Who 
knows?&nbsp; If I live that long and EQ1 is still around and I&#39;m still able to 
keep up with it in whatever format it goes into whether it be still for PC or 
upgraded to some kind of VR type system I&#39;ll play it and help where i can 
to&nbsp; keep Norrath alive&nbsp; and make more memories and friends as i go 
along</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>You&#39;re right Wulfric, I did slightly misunderstand your 
  post. I was looking at it from the point of the majority of other posts were 
  negative and slamming EQ1 and you were defending it (Being the &quot;naysayer&quot; so 
  to speak). Sorry, didn&#39;t mean it in that way. Like you and Greg, I will be 
  there when they pull the plug. <br><br>Yes, EQ does have it&#39;s problems. Think 
  about it. It was the first massive effort by a game manufacturer to create a 
  world as large as EQ is. Heck even CNN did a story about the game and I think 
  it was either UCLA or Stanford that did a study on the economy of EQ. If a 
  computer game can make that kind of impact and still keep running, that really 
  says a lot. Now don&#39;t get me wrong in the next few sentences, I&#39;m not really 
  supporting SOE or Verant but you do have to give them some credit, for all 
  that &quot;COULD&quot; have gone wrong they have done a really good job at preventing 
  that. Granted we still have server crashes, updates don&#39;t go as well as 
  planned, there will be bugs. (Oh wait, I mean &quot;Program Features&quot;) /wink 
  <br><br>Recently we had the server merges. This seemed to shake up a lot of 
  players but also seemed like a needed thing. I was originally on Sol Ro and it 
  was like no one was there half the time. Granted I loved the decrease in the 
  lag in PoK and the Bazaar. It was actually nice to be able to chat with higher 
  levels that were still in the game. Just on an everyday &quot;How ya doin?&quot; way and 
  not a &quot;Can ya buff or PL me?&quot; way. I&#39;m not a &quot;power player&quot; who&#39;s interested 
  in achieving greatness within a week so I enjoy chatting with higher, they 
  have a lot of good wisdom to share. But getting back to my original point, I 
  was glad to see the servers merge because there were more people I could group 
  with that were around my level. Although I&#39;m starting to get sick of the whole 
  Bristlebane vs. Sol Ro hatred. But thats another thread.<br><br>I better wrap 
  this up, I&#39;m getting long winded here. I still feel that SOE won&#39;t shut EQ1 
  down anytime soon. Heck they just had the city of FV get taken over by evil 
  forces. I&#39;m sure there will be another huge battle for it and I hope I can be 
  there! Anyway, enough of my ranting. <br><br>Be excellent to each 
  other!<br><br><br><br><br><br>________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Message:

  &lt;wulftech@...&gt;<br>Subject: Re: EQ math<br><br>Steven,<br><br>I 
  think you misunderstood.&nbsp; I am NOT the naysayer.&nbsp; I was saying that 
  in response to Matt&#39;s email which was largely filled with negativism that the 
  game would end in a couple years.&nbsp; The point of my post is that I will be 
  playing EQ for as long as EQ is around to be played.&nbsp; Be that 2 years, 5 
  years, or 25 years.&nbsp; The original purpose of my EQ math post was to show 
  that IF EQ is around in 25 years then the in-game date will have caught up 
  with where EQ2 supposedly begins.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#39;s all.&nbsp; The 
  speculation on what would happen to the game within that time frame is what 
  brought about the topic of whether or not the game would survive that 
  long.&nbsp; Personally, I hope it 
  does.<br><br><br>Wulfric<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage
