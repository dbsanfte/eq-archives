<div id="ygrps-yiv-760818295"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">So the next time I&#39;m grouped with a tailor and he asks for the pelts I should 
<br>say no? &nbsp;The good groups I&#39;ve been in will share the stuff needed for a 
<br>person&#39;s certain trade skill. &nbsp;They were getting some nice loot and alot of 
<br>it while I was medding. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t care about the bronze and fs. &nbsp;I did care 
<br>about being in on the pages and the gems. &nbsp;I don&#39;t see anything wrong with 
<br>wanting to be able to loot some of that.
