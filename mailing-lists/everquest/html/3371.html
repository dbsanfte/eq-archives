 </span></blockquote>Yes.  Generally, except for the first few levels, pure INT casters aren&#39;t<br/>
going to need or use weapons to fight with.  They will use their pets (or,<br/>
in the case of Wizzies, use root and snare) to fight melee, while the<br/>
characters use spells.  Since there are some decent INT items for use in<br/>
Primary and Sec slots, it pays to find them and use them instead of weapons.</div>
