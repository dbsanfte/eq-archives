<div id="ygrps-yiv-548745000">Hmmm.. Well, I don&#39;t know how well that would sit with those of us who don&#39;t<br/>
have money. And what if someone&#39;s money was all on their corpse? But an<br/>
interesting suggestion. :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; How about having a NPC which can summon your corpse to a safe point,<br/>
&gt; with all gear intact. Have a cash fee based on level. That way, if you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t (or don&#39;t want to) travel back to the point of death, you can<br/>
&gt; pay the fee and have your corpse summoned.<br/>
