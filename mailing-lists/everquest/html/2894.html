<p class="ygrps-yiv-1954852675MsoNormal">I have both male and Female characters, mostly female but the only reason for me was for a bit of variety because all my characters are high elves, and because I usually play with all 4 main chars at once, (works out real good when u can control a cleric, druid, mage and a warrior yourself i.e. no idiots getting you killed because they don�t know what to do when everything goes to buggery, even on my 56K freeserve connection (which surprised the hell outta me thats for sure) but I digress, the only reason I use both male and female models is as I said because I play high elves and since most races are limited to a handful of different models male/female it can get hard to make them look completely different from each other especially if they are all wearing the same kind of gear like DRT&#39;s and leather, robes etc. Although I find playing a character that is the same sex as me is easier since I don�t have to keep reminding myself what sex my char is.</p>

<div></div>&gt;I know a guy who plays females bc he gets turned on watching his character 
<div></div>&gt;run and fight in third person view. Very weird person.

<div></div>&gt; &gt; Hi, 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; ROFLOL at Rob. Yeah EC definitely!!!! 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; I&#39;m female and I play female characters. The only way I&#39;d consider 
<div></div>&gt;playing 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; a male character is if their stats were better. But, since EQ is an equal 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; opportunity creator, meaning men and women share the same stats, it&#39;s not 
<div></div>&gt;an 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; issue. 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; Now, I do notice that when I&#39;m playing with my 22 year old son and his 
<div></div>&gt;male 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; character I get a few more buffs than him but not often. 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; Maybe men play female characters because they think it will help them 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; understand women better. LOL just joking! 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; Anyway, I love the game and I don&#39;t care whether your male or female just 
<div></div>&gt;as 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; long as you enjoy the game!
