<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721984405">Truly excellent stuff, Su. Thank you for sharing the link.<br/>
<br/>
The sad thing is, you can just sit in GFay and watch the /ooc and /shout<br/>
channel and see a lot of the stuff that Lowtax describes humorously in his<br/>
&quot;newbie guide&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Example from my own experience on Tarew Marr server.<br/>
<br/>
The other night I was playing my level 13 scratch (totally non-twinked) Wood<br/>
Elf Ranger. A level 1 HE enchanter started spamming GFay for 5pp to buy her<br/>
level 1 spells. Another person and I finally replied back in /ooc that you<br/>
could buy just about all the useful level 1 spells for a platinum or so. She<br/>
then changed her spam to asking for 2pp.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else jumped in and chided us for &quot;being harsh&quot; so I decided to give<br/>
the beggar 2pp just to see what happened. I tracked her down near Felwithe,<br/>
hailed her, and gave her 2pp. The VERY next thing she says to me is &quot;you got<br/>
any caster stuff?&quot; Not &quot;Thank You&quot;, not even &quot;ty&quot; or &quot;thx&quot;, just &quot;you got<br/>
any caster stuff&quot;. I just said &quot;No, I am a Ranger, sorry&quot; and turned and<br/>
left.<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes later this same person was back spamming the zone for tiny<br/>
daggers (ingredient to cast pet) because she &quot;looked everywhere in Felwithe&quot;<br/>
and &quot;couldn&#39;t find them anywhere&quot;. I have played a HE enchanter, so I KNOW<br/>
you can buy them for 1sp each from one of the 4 merchants in the room where<br/>
the Enchanter Guildmaster is, so I repeated that information in /ooc. She<br/>
then asks for money to buy them because she didn&#39;t have any. I told her in<br/>
/ooc &quot;An enchanter can get 1 sp for a wasp wing, and that happens to be how<br/>
much a tiny dagger costs. Start killing stuff and stop begging.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I finally deleted my Enchanter at level 10 (I had also played him<br/>
without any help from my higher level characters) he had nearly all his<br/>
level 1, 4, and 8 spells, full (some looted, some bought) cloth armor, as<br/>
well as 50pp in the bank, from just killing and looting everything he was<br/>
able to, and selling it to merchants, so I know it can be done. Sure, he did<br/>
a lot of corpse runs (this was before the patch that eliminated corpse runs<br/>
under level 10), but 1sp per wasp wing, 4sp per royal jelly, 3gp per wasp<br/>
poison sac, 1pp per cracked staff, etc.at the merchants adds up fairly<br/>
quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I guess maybe I was a litte harsh to that newbie chanter, yes, but I have<br/>
used my Druid&#39;s bank account to equip numerous new druids and rangers in<br/>
that zone with full leather armor, a half-way decent newbie weapon, and a<br/>
little buffing (skin like diamond, sow, strength of stone, thorns, regen),<br/>
but not because they begged. I did it because they seemed to be players that<br/>
wanted to have fun and to play the game right, but needed a little boost,<br/>
and I enjoy helping people. I don&#39;t enjoy beggars, though.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have thoughts to share on players who spam the newbie zones<br/>
asking to be given free money or items? I would be interested to see how the<br/>
others on this mailing list feel about the subject.<br/>
