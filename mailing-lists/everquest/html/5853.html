<div id="ygrps-yiv-652329095">These disciplines came out around the same time as the Berzerker class.  I<br/>
think it was inr esponse to a lot of people complaining that the class<br/>
advancement was not very fair between casters to melee.  In a caster class<br/>
you get spells about every 5 levels even if you don&#39;t gain any new<br/>
abilities.  But for melee classes, by the time you reach level 30 you&#39;ve<br/>
gained all the skills you&#39;re going to receive until level 51.  So unless<br/>
you&#39;ve got the money and can continue to buy better weapons every 5 levels,<br/>
you could potentially be using the same stuff from level 30 to level 51.<br/>
That&#39;s not very far across the board if you ask me.  So I believe the<br/>
discipline tomes were introduced  to give melee classes somethign to work on<br/>
during those 20 levels.<br/>

&gt; Yeah. They&#39;re bought for 2 cp each in the PoK Library. Full melee classes<br/>
&gt; get them around 30th level, while hybrids have to wait until 51st (my<br/>
main,<br/>
&gt; a ranger, is just about nearing the point where I can get his first<br/>
&gt; Discipline -- the Resistant Discipline, I believe, which is the one<br/>
warriors<br/>
&gt; get at 30th or 31st).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Disciplines have been in the game for some time now. Someone who has been<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the game for a few years could probably shed more light on exactly how old<br/>
&gt; they are. I&#39;ve only played since January 2003, and I think they might&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been around at that time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once you have the Discipline book, you open it and learn the Discipline.<br/>
&gt; Each Discipline has certain benefits (Resistant bumps up all your<br/>
&gt; resistances, for instances). They last for a certain amount of time, but<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; can only use them once every X number of hours of play. There&#39;s a window<br/>
&gt; that you can pull up (can&#39;t remember the command to open it up) that lets<br/>
&gt; you activate the Disciplines.<br/>
