<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517270854">I know they are for melee classes. I think you have to buy books from a merchant of your class to get disciplines. I think there might be AA ones as well. I don&#39;t play melee class so I don&#39;t know. Maybe a monk, rogue, or warrior could shed some more light.<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t be of more help.<br/>

I was looking at writeups on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.crgaming.com/">http://eq.crgaming.com/</a> and came across <br/>
a thing called Disciplines.  But I have not discovered how to use <br/>
these.  Is this old info?  If not how do I get the Disciplines?<br/>
