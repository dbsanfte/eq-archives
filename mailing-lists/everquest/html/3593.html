<div id="ygrps-yiv-180594014">Hey Everybody,<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list! I have a general question that hasen&#39;t been <br/>
answered for a few months now. I&#39;m hoping one of you might know what <br/>
the heck is going on! Ok, so this is what&#39;s happening;<br/>
Whenever I zone my characters face will change!?!?! I&#39;m thinking it <br/>
has something to do with low memory but I have about 500mb of ram. <br/>
And I&#39;m not too keen on computers so if there is another form of <br/>
memory that could be lacking please enlighten me! This stupid problem <br/>
has coused me to quit playing for awhile. It makes me sooo mad!!!!<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Deidre</div>
