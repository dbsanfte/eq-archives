<div id="ygrps-yiv-858399764">Not all that long ago, I contacted support to ask about the likelihood of <br/>
having a cancelled account&#39;s characters deleted. I was told that they only <br/>
guarantee the char to be there for 3 months, but they don&#39;t actively do char <br/>
wipes, so it is rather likely that your chars will be there whenever you go <br/>
back. You just can&#39;t be mad if that&#39;s after 3 months and they&#39;re not there.</div>
