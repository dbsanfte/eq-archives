<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Gotta agree with ya there Su.&nbsp; With my lvl 67 
Shammy i find that my slows tend to pull agro away from the tank and&nbsp; i 
have to automatically start melee as soon as the mob gets close to me&nbsp; 
until the Tank can steal agro back until i cast my DoT on em and regain agro 
again lol.&nbsp; I have learned as well to not run away either cause that brief 
moment when you turn away could get ya killed a lot faster&nbsp; if you don&#39;t 
just stand there melee back and hope yer healer (druid/Shaman/ Cleric/ or even 
Ranger) can get a heal off on ya before too long.&nbsp; Prim example was last 
night in Harbingers and I wound up getting the agro form a Named and wound up 
melee cause we had a crap load of ads and even with my AoE slow i still managed 
to not only get the named but the adds at the same time .&nbsp; Luckily I had my 
Shammy 1.5 in hand and clicked it to help keep me alive till The cleric could 
get a heal off on me and the rest of the melee could draw the adds and such away 
form this almost dead shimmy =)</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>True. I had people laughing at me when I was in my 40s and 
  50s level range because I wanted to melee a bit and let the mobs try to hit me 
  to make my defense go up. They said I would never need defense and I didn&#39;t 
  need to worry about it. However, being able to dodge hits can really come in 
  handy and sometimes I have had to melee mobs to death when oom and having to 
  kill a mob that is running away. A single bash can be the difference between 
  killing a mob and getting a ton of adds.<br>-Su<br><br>======== At 2004-12-18,

  focus on your <br>battle skills. Trust me, at the lower levels that is a 
  perfect time to <br>get the skills built up. I can understand wanting to go in 
  and just beat <br>the heck out of everything and being uber and killing it all 
  in one <br>shot. But ponder this, When you get to be up in levels (50&#39;s, 60&#39;s, 
  and <br>70&#39;s) you are going to be taking on some majorly nasty monsters. If 
  you <br>have just gained levels and have an uber weapon but never really 
  worked <br>on your fighting skills and they are low, it&#39;s not going to help 
  you or <br>your party out very much. Actually you will hurt your group more 
  than <br>help them. Now being a Shammy you have some awesome spells at higher 
  <br>levels. This is another thing I would suggest focusing on. If your at a 
  <br>higher level and your fighting say a dragon and 60% of your casts fizz 
  <br>then you may as well run or be able to hit! (See first part) otherwise 
  <br>your gonna get killed or your group killed.<br><br>That&#39;s just my 2
