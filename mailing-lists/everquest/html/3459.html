 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m with you, my friend.  :-)  My ex-husband never understood my love of RP<br/>
games to begin with, and that was before EQ came along. Now at the ripe old<br/>
age of 35, it&#39;s hard to find single men who also like this kind of thing...<br/>
so, single I stay, until I meet that man-&#39;o-my-dreams who loves both EQ and<br/>
all things Disney.  ;-)<br/>
