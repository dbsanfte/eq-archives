<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I believe Fennin Ro is one of the oldest servers 
out there, which is why we want to form a guild focused on something besides 
levelling and getting ahead... sometimes it seems like those of us interested in 
that are few and far between, and we&#39;d like to band together. )</font></div>

  <p><br>How old is Fennin Ro? The Nameless server is old enough that everyone 
  is a twink and it is all about leveling instead of playing there...or so it 
  seems.

    <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello all! <br>
    <p>We are looking for several adventurous souls to join us in forming a new 
    guild on Fennin Ro. Our purpose will be to enjoy this game for all it&#39;s 
    worth -- to help each other, to teach those new to Norrath the skills they 
    will need to survive. Rules will be simple -- things such as never beg, 
    never ks, and always help your guildmate first. We will also be focused on 
    life in Norrath being more than just the battle -- other skills are given to 
    you for a reason. Want to learn how to tailor? You&#39;ve got to start with the 
    basics, and if you and a couple of guildmates want a nice quiet night, why 
    not go out together and gather spiderling silks to get going? Or get 
    together for a trip to Steamfont to pick up some supplies for smithing? <br>
    <p>We will also be planning raids for various levels, a couple of parties... 
    and maybe even a wedding or two. ) <br>
    <p>So if you&#39;re interested in helping us create this guild, just to have 
    fun, either leave a post here, or email to akane@... with your 
    character name, level, class and race, along with an email address where we 
    can reach you. <br>
    <p>Look forward to hearing from you! ) <br>
