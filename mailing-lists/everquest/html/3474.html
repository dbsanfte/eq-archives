 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; narrow boards and was immediately agroed by the mobs and it took over 4<br/>
&gt; hours for them to find my corpse lol and I was bound  umm in all places<br/>
&gt; Neriak heh had been bound there since I was born and I was a level 23 atm<br/>
&gt; lol<br/>
&gt; but the secret  of course when going up some of the icy ones is to look<br/>
&gt; walk with sow off  follow someone who has been there before and  who can<br/>
&gt; show you  exactly where to step etc.  It took me only  one fall and  2<br/>
 </span></blockquote>trips<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; getting form the zone entrance in GD to the upper area  to the Tents to<br/>
&gt; learn how to get up that far safely. getting out though was the bad part<br/>
&gt; cause part of the way you cant get out the same way you got in lol so I<br/>
&gt; wound up doing the ninja  zone where I faced a certain wall in the pit<br/>
&gt; invised so not to get agro  ran into the wall and camped out came back<br/>
&gt; camped out again and was back at zone entrance to GD.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tend to lag behind people though. Or they stop right in front of me and I<br/>
slam into the back of them. heh. Not as scary as recently when I got lost<br/>
from group on a raid in Hate and nearly ran right into Innoruuk himself.<br/>
Man, you shoulda seen me backpedal. I was like WRONG ROOM! and turned around<br/>
and ran the hell away.<br/>
Hmm.. I&#39;m still not sure where tents are..<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the crowding yeah we get that on  the Saryn server as of late as<br/>
&gt; well.  Our Raid coordinator for my guild  got a bunch of us together   and<br/>
&gt; had us camp there and  each of us would play an alt and he would join<br/>
&gt; whatever group was at the tents and let us know in raid chat what class<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; leaving and to have the corresponding guildy log on that char  in Velks<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fill in the slot till we had all guildies in the group lol.  we spent a<br/>
&gt; whole weekend doing this and we eventually had it to where  except for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>once<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or twice we had nothing but guildies  at the tents in Velks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool! Sounds like fun. I wish there were enough in my guild over 50 to<br/>
actually make a full group.<br/>
luv,<br/>
