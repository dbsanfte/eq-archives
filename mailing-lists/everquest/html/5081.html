<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660121332">I have been in a couple of guild adventures.  It&#39;s not too hard to <br/>
get 6 guildies together, but not all the time.<br/>
<br/>
And the main idea of all these adventures is to get to the named mob, <br/>
because that is where the big drop is.  Rangers and Druids have <br/>
track, so once again we have a use.  And that snare helps too when <br/>
they go for friends!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a level 41 Half Elf Druid.  Like you, I have soloed most of my <br/>
life.  What I have found about LDoN is, true you have to group.  But <br/>
the organization is there, so that the groups constantly change.  <br/>
Most often I am asked to join by putting my LFG flag up.  The <br/>
adventures are short, 2 hrs and have a specific goal to obtain.  The <br/>
exp is great, typically half a level per adventure.  We druids are <br/>
popular for our regen buff and healing, and have counteract poison up <br/>
if someone&#39;s gonna play with the crates.  You can save yourself in <br/>
time if your fast.  Then, after 2 hrs, you split the loot, typically <br/>
50 - 80 plat your share, and go back to soloing.  I thought it was <br/>
more for guilds as well, but have yet to see a group of all one <br/>
guild.  I am typically quiet (I type slow, hehe) but so much goes on <br/>
so fast, that nobody seems to mind.<br/>

&gt;   I am a lvl 41 Halfling Druid. Haven&#39;t purchased LDoN yet, as I <br/>
most<br/>
&gt;   often play solo and don&#39;t know that I would use it. Have <br/>
everything up<br/>
&gt;   to this expansion, but am not convinced that it is worthwhile. <br/>
Sounds<br/>
&gt;   very nice, but I have had two guilds I have been a part of fade <br/>
away,<br/>
&gt;   and this sounds like something best suited to guilds.<br/>
