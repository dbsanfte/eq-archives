<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257634872">I have seen lag all over the place as well.  Not sure<br/>
what it is  but certain zones brutal, ,especially<br/>
Emerald Jungle.  <br/>
<br/>
Be patient I sense we will see this improve with the<br/>
next few patches.  Regardless of what Sony says or<br/>
does not say, there is something broke.  I even<br/>
preload the zones, THANK GOD, and it still is slow.<br/>
<br/>
We can only hope<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; experiencing an inordinate amount of lag lately? <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; mean more than you usually get, even in zones that<br/>
&gt; &gt; are unpopulated.  For example, whenever I port to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Feerrott, I start lagging immediately, and<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; if I port out, the lag gets even worse, as if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; carrying it with me.  But I had absolutely no lag<br/>
&gt; &gt; before I zoned itno Feerrott.  So I&#39;m wondering if<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s something about that zone?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And before you say it&#39;s my computer system, I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; running a Pentium 4 1.8Ghz with 1 GB of RAM, and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; 128MB ATI Radeon 9200 video card.  I also have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; cable modem connection.  And as I said, there&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; &gt; lag until I zone into Feerrott.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Before you ask if I have anything running in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; background, I use this system for nothing but<br/>
&gt; &gt; Everquest, so I have already gone ahead and shut<br/>
&gt; &gt; down all the background programs.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Before you ask if I have checked EQ&#39;s<br/>
&gt; knowledgebase,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve already done everythign they&#39;ve reccomended<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; it hasn&#39;t solved the problem.  One thing I did<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; out was that certain zones will lag becasue on ATI<br/>
&gt; &gt; cards there&#39;s an option for Wait For Vertical<br/>
&gt; Sync,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and they reccomend setting it to Off.  So I did<br/>
&gt; &gt; this, but now I&#39;m getting lag in EVERY zone so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; really don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And before you ask if I have updated to the latest<br/>
&gt; &gt; video drivers, I did that when I found out about<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Vertical Sync issue.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As you can probably tell, I&#39;m not without some<br/>
&gt; &gt; troubleshooting knowledge, but I&#39;ve done<br/>
&gt; everything<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can think of, and the problem is still<br/>
&gt; persisting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  The one clue I have is that the problem didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; start happening until after last patch.  So I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; know if that has anything to do with it.  I<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would check and see if anyone else is having<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; problem.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
