<div id="ygrps-yiv-58513887">Finally got my card. Got it installed and went for a test drive.<br/>
<br/>
One area that is a big problem is Rivervale. With the last expansion <br/>
Rivervale became so laggy that I avoided going home when I could. Now <br/>
I get a few hiccups when I enter the zone, then it settles down to a <br/>
playable level. A hitch now and then, but nothing like before the <br/>
upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Checked out a few cities, some zones in between. Made technical <br/>
adjustments. On the whole quite pleased.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I noticed was a bit of lag in laggy zones (Luclin was <br/>
almost unplayable until now)until I had been there a bit. When I went <br/>
to the Bazaar I just did a slow 360 and the lag went away. Figure <br/>
enough of the zone loaded into active memory to carry the play from <br/>
then on. Perhaps someone could explain what was actuall happening to <br/>
the system when I do this. Anyway, I do a scan of my environment when <br/>
I zone and things are pretty smooth.<br/>
<br/>
This is my last upgrade to my present system. Have to replace my <br/>
tower next, and hope to hold out a while. How much can I spend every <br/>
year on these things? The family expects me to feed them, and I hate <br/>
to dissppoint them too often on that account just to play my game.<br/>
<br/>
Now if DSL comes down a bit in price, I may try that. Could that be <br/>
the key to absolute smooth-as-butter-on-a-bald-monkey performance on <br/>
my aging machine? (The thing is just a bit over a year old. How fast <br/>
they grow old.)<br/>
