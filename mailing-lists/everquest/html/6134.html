<div id="ygrps-yiv-731716018">Hey Su =)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think to check here before.  Just wanted to<br/>
see how you all are doing, been a long time and I haven&#39;t seen any of<br/>
your or your brothers toons online recently.   I responded to your<br/>
ingame email too btw =)<br/>
<br/>
Just checking to see what you guys are doing, what games you are playing<br/>
and what your future plans are for EQ.<br/>
<br/>
I have been jumping around a lot.  You know I was playing SWG but<br/>
haven&#39;t been back there in quite a while.  Was very excited about EQ2<br/>
but although it&#39;s a simply georgous game, having a hard time getting<br/>
&quot;into&quot; it.... Not as fun as I expected it to be.   Have tried WoW and<br/>
that&#39;s pretty fun even if the graphics aren&#39;t my style...  But getting<br/>
tired of that too....  My real life bro has been begging me to try City<br/>
of Heros and to tell you the truth, have only been playing a few weeks,<br/>
but that has been a lot of fun, but we will see if it lasts, it does<br/>
seem kinda limited...  I even picked up Matrix Online LOL... And it<br/>
seems a lot like city of heros with better graphics and that cyberpunk<br/>
world, kinda fun, we&#39;ll see... Sounds like the story will be furthered<br/>
within the game somehow and I&#39;m weird, but I loved all the movies and so<br/>
I&#39;m curious about the game.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, having said all that, I still find myself coming back to EQ ... As<br/>
far as I can tell, no game has it&#39;s depth or social system and although<br/>
it&#39;s getting old and a bit tired, it is still &quot;home&quot; of sorts and I<br/>
always love coming back. Hahahaha, <br/>
<br/>
Please respond here on privately!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Picture attachments are not allowed in this group as it causes some<br/>
people&#39;s email clients to crash.<br/>
I have to check to see if the thing is set to allow people to upload<br/>
pictures. I might have that on moderators only because of abuse from<br/>
spammers.<br/>
luv,<br/>
