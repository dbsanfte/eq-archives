<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935559154">You play NWN too??<br/>
That is such a fun game although I don&#39;t like how reliant the movement is on<br/>
the mouse. I don&#39;t like to use my mouse that much. And my hirelings are hard<br/>
to control. Like when they decide to run out of my view and attack things<br/>
that I was planning to avoid so as not to get wiped out.<br/>
I have a lvl 11 cleric.<br/>
