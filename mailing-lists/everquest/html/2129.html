<div><font size="2">It&#39;s graphics in certain spots that do it. The gates/militia 
house area of FP is one, and the ramp of MM is another. The platform by zone at 
the top is lagless, as is the bottom, but the ramp itself...major lag. It&#39;s 
gotta be a code issue, the video card I have is one of the best. </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>I have an AMD Athlon 1.4Ghz processor, Nvidia GeForce 2 MX 
  64Mb with TV out,<br>Philips PSC706 Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card, and 1.2Gb of 
  RAM.<br>I haven&#39;t been into Rivervale since upgrading my RAM but I still 
  experience<br>lag in other zones. Sometimes lag spikes hit and I go almost LD 
  5 times<br>before the lag stops and I can continue. But that usually coincides 
  with a<br>couple of my group members actually going LD so I&#39;m pretty sure it 
  is a<br>server side problem. I will take a character to Rivervale later and 
  check it<br>out.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>&gt; I just added the necessary memory 
  to max out my system.<br>&gt; Unfortunately, that max is 256. I would love to 
  go to 512 or more,<br>&gt; but that would require a new 
  system.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Things have improved with the added memory, but I 
  still get lots of<br>&gt; lag in Rivervale, and similar town type zones. My 
  graphics card is an<br>&gt; Nvidia TNT 64 (don&#39;t know what the 64 means, it is 
  32meg). It is the<br>&gt; best I could find last year for the money I had, and 
  more than<br>&gt; adequate for the game at that time. I needed pci, so my 
  choices were<br>&gt; a bit limited. More than that, my knowledge was much less 
  in those<br>&gt; days.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I am curious as to what kinds of 
  graphics cards people use, and<br>&gt; whether or not they are experiencing 
  lag in zones like Rivervale in<br>&gt; spite of having a pretty good 
  system.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Anyone have a killer rig, and still find lag or other 
  problems? I<br>&gt; just wonder how much is the game, how much my now low end 
  system.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Visit
