I will probably buy the forthcoming atlas, once it is out. It will be <br/>
cheaper than printing up the rest of the maps I don&#39;t have, since I <br/>
have been only printing maps as I need them. Plus, we ran out of ink <br/>
and nobody in my household wants to be the one to spring for the new <br/>
ink. Probably because they know a large number of maps will be <br/>
printed as soon as the ink is loaded. ;)<br/>
<br/>
What I would really like is to have eq in a window, with a second <br/>
monitor to hold my data; maps, charts, lists, and recipes. I know <br/>
there is a hack to allow this, but I would prefer a sanctioned <br/>
window. Plus I don&#39;t have the horsepower on this system to carry such <br/>
a load. My game would suffer.<br/>
<br/>
Twenty bucks for the atlas sounds cheaper all round.<br/>
