<div id="ygrps-yiv-60811684">I looked into Norton Ghost and it had really bad<br/>
reviews on downloads.com. One of the reviewers<br/>
mentioned a less expensive program (with better<br/>
reviews) called Acronis True Image. I think I will<br/>
look into the abilities of the Acronis one to see if<br/>
it would work for what I want to do. If not I may see<br/>
about going with Norton Ghost 10.0. I really really<br/>
appreciate the info!<br/>
I just need to remember to burn something to DVD to<br/>
help restore windows XP in case there is a problem<br/>
when I upgrade to the new mainboard setup.<br/>
Direcway just sold out to Hughes.net and the service<br/>
has really declined. I keep having pages timeout when<br/>
loading and get errors, their tech support no longer<br/>
works (can&#39;t get through to anyone), and my pop3 email<br/>
no longer works (despite my following their tutorials<br/>
on setting it up). So I had to switch to using yahoo<br/>
email. bleh. I think its evident I&#39;m more than a teeny<br/>
bit annoyed. <br/>
The bandwidth cap is a major pain. When I first signed<br/>
up they said that unless I was constantly loading<br/>
really large files at a high rate of speed I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have to worry about the cap. That was before they<br/>
lowered the amount of bandwidth allowed before<br/>
capping. Loading a patch for EQ takes about 4 hours or<br/>
more. Its really annoying. I lose connection whenever<br/>
it rains-- or sometimes when its bright and sunny for<br/>
no apparent reason. I would not recommend this<br/>
&quot;service&quot; to anyone. I had to call tech support sooo<br/>
many times that I memorized some of the routines and<br/>
then one of the techs in India started flirting with<br/>
me (which was actually pretty funny).<br/>
Man.. I&#39;m venting..<br/>
Once I get the system upgraded I will see about<br/>
playing again.<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
*hugs*<br/>
luv,<br/>

This didn&#39;t go the first time I tried to send. Stupid<br/>
hughesnet. grrr. trying again.<br/>

&gt; Look into a prograM called Norton&#39;s Ghost.  It will<br/>
&gt; do exactly what you want it to do.  I&#39;ve used it<br/>
&gt; several times on my own systems when installing new<br/>
&gt; hard drives to set as primary.  Basically, what you<br/>
&gt; do is install the new drive as a slave, completely<br/>
&gt; wiped (you dont even have to partition it).  Then<br/>
&gt; you install Norton&#39;s Ghost on your main drive.  Run<br/>
&gt; Norton&#39;s Ghost and choose the option to do a direct<br/>
&gt; ghost copy to the new drive.  Everything right down<br/>
&gt; to the partitions will be copied to the new drive. <br/>
&gt; Then you shut down the machine, switch the drive<br/>
&gt; over to master and reboot.  Barring any major<br/>
&gt; problems it&#39;ll boot up exactly as if it were the<br/>
&gt; regular drive on that system.  Then you can take the<br/>
&gt; original drive and wipe it and use it as a secondary<br/>
&gt; for extra space.  It&#39;s a handy program.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your system sounds decent enough to run EQ albeit<br/>
&gt; with some lag in the newer zones.  Turning off a lot<br/>
&gt; of options might help that though.  However, on<br/>
&gt; DirecWay I wouldn&#39;t expect too much.  DirecWay is<br/>
&gt; bad about limiting the amount of data that can be<br/>
&gt; sent at any given time.  If you send mroe than you<br/>
&gt; are allowed to, they pretty much stop all<br/>
&gt; communication and give you some stupid message about<br/>
&gt; exceedxing the bandwidth.  Then it takes like 5<br/>
&gt; minutes to reset.  You can look it up, the info is<br/>
&gt; right there ont he DirecWay site.  That&#39;s why they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t reccomend using DirecWay for gaming.  But if<br/>
&gt; all you want to do is browse the web and chat, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; fine.  If I can find the link, I&#39;ll post it for you.<br/>

&gt;   I have a Cleric. But I haven&#39;t actually gotten xp<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt;   over a year. I can&#39;t even get dialup where I live<br/>
&gt;   because the phone company has spliced my lines so<br/>
&gt;   badly I can&#39;t even dial out to an ISP. They refuse<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   fix it and so far I haven&#39;t found any way to get<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt;   to. Too much other stuff to worry about frankly.<br/>
&gt; Like<br/>
&gt;   finding a lawyer to sue a doctor for malpractice,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;   still working on repairing hurricane Rita damage.<br/>
&gt;   I currently have direcway Satellite-- which<br/>
&gt; inherently<br/>
&gt;   has latency. When I first got it with the Direcway<br/>
&gt;   4000 2-way the bandwidth was 800k down and about<br/>
&gt; 50k<br/>
&gt;   up (allegedly 50k up-- clocked around 30k).<br/>
&gt; Sometime<br/>
&gt;   later when the modem died due to an incident with<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt;   cat and a glass of milk I got the newer Direcway<br/>
&gt; 6000.<br/>
&gt;   Direcway then dropped the bandwidth to 500k down<br/>
&gt;   (without informing me). When I play world of<br/>
&gt; warcraft<br/>
&gt;   I generally have between 1200 to 4000ms latency.<br/>
&gt; Last<br/>
&gt;   time I tried to get into EQ it just kept timing<br/>
&gt; out on<br/>
&gt;   me.<br/>
&gt;   As for my system, I have an AMD athlon thunderbird<br/>
&gt;   1.4Ghz processor, 1GB of DDR SDRAM, ASUS A7M266-M<br/>
&gt;   motherboard, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128Mb vid card, and<br/>
&gt;   Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card.<br/>
&gt;   I plan on upgrading to an ASUS A8V Deluxe (rev 2)<br/>
&gt;   motherboard, 2Gb Kingston PC3200 ValueRAM, and AMD<br/>
&gt;   Athlon 3500 2.0GHz processor (with venice core).<br/>
&gt;   I will be using my same video card, sound card,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;   power supply (Antec SmartPower 2.0 450W) and<br/>
&gt; adding an<br/>
&gt;   additional 300Gb harddrive.<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m currently trying to figure out how to transfer<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt;   of my data from my puny primary drive and putting<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt;   on the 300Gb drive and setting it as primary, then<br/>
&gt;   upgrading to the new mobo setup without having to<br/>
&gt; use<br/>
&gt;   a windows xp cd. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; restore<br/>
&gt;   CDs for my pc bc it didn&#39;t come with any software<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt;   CDs. One of those deals where HP partitioned the<br/>
&gt;   harddrive. Since the warrenty is up on it I doubt<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt;   could get tech support from them.<br/>
&gt;   I wish I could figure out a way to just copy all<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt;   the programs so that they would be installable. I<br/>
&gt;   should have an extra OEM of xp laying around<br/>
&gt; somewhere<br/>
&gt;   but it got lost in all the chaos of the hurricane.<br/>
&gt;   luv,<br/>

&gt;   Su&gt; what class are you?  And what is your<br/>
&gt; connection<br/>
&gt;   speed?  I assume you&#39;re on dial up in a rural area<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;   highs peed internet such as cable or DSL is not<br/>
&gt;   available to you.  Even if you&#39;re connecting at<br/>
&gt;   44k-46k sometimes you can help yourself by what<br/>
&gt; kind<br/>
&gt;   of computer you have.  I know at one point I had a<br/>
&gt;   PIII 800mhz system on an ISDN line and I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt;   TOO much lag.  But that was back when Kunark and<br/>
&gt;   Velious were the newest expansions.  Now I have a<br/>
&gt; P4<br/>
&gt;   2.4 Ghz with 1GB RAM and a 256MB video card on a<br/>
&gt; 5Mb<br/>
&gt;   cable modem connection.  No lag at all.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I prefer to solo, unfortunately its not possible<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt;   my connection. At level 66 I still have trouble<br/>
&gt;   killing level 30s. Mostly because of the damage<br/>
&gt;   misreporting related to the lag. Although I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   played in months. My connection has gotten so bad<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt;   I really can&#39;t play anymore. I tried doing an LDON<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt;   few months ago but the lag got so bad that I was<br/>
&gt; stuck<br/>
&gt;   for 15 minutes unable to do anything. Zoning takes<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt;   least 5 minutes. If I die it will take me 20<br/>
&gt; minutes<br/>
&gt;   at the very least to get back to my corpse.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes<br/>
&gt;   an hour if I have to zone a lot.<br/>
&gt;   I really don&#39;t think the game is designed for<br/>
&gt;   characters of my class and level to be able to<br/>
&gt; solo. <br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve pretty much switched to World of Warcraft now<br/>
&gt;   because it doesn&#39;t do damage misreporting and<br/>
&gt; death<br/>
&gt;   doesn&#39;t take too much time.<br/>
&gt;   luv,<br/>

&gt;   &gt; a lot of duoing, but I seem to enjoy soloing<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt;   &gt; nowdays.  I can go<br/>
&gt;   &gt; where I want, do what I want and keep the loot<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;   &gt; xp for myself. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still like to group, but<br/>
&gt;   &gt; sometimes, for my own<br/>
&gt;   &gt; peace of mind, I much prefer soloing.  Anyone<br/>
