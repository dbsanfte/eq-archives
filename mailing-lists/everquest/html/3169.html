<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344873327"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hello.  I bought eq today along with a game card.  I installed it,<br/>
&gt; went to new account, and when I click it it bounces me to the<br/>
&gt; desktop.  i dried disabling my firewall, soundcard, starting with<br/>
&gt; all unnecessary processes disabled.  uninstalled/installed many<br/>
&gt; times.  checked for irq and I found that the cable modem network<br/>
&gt; cark was sharing 12 with the onboard sound, tried moving the network<br/>
&gt; card and ended up having to reactivate xp!  As it stands, I&#39;ve yet<br/>
&gt; to set foot in Norrath.<br/>
&gt; I registered at the Station, and tried to use the tech bulliten<br/>
&gt; board, but it won&#39;t let me post, says that I need to me a regisered<br/>
&gt; user-- I thought I was!!<br/>
&gt; anyways, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.  PLEASE HELP!!  I can&#39;t wait to play<br/>
&gt; my new game!!!<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
