<b>Subject:</b> Fun in Velious <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-293206274">I got tired of camping Brutes in Warsliks Woods, so finally made my <br/>
journey to Velious. I took the boat, just to have done it once. Found <br/>
my way to Eastern Wastes. Started foraging the tufts of dire wolf fur <br/>
I need for advancing my tailoring. <br/>
<br/>
I have not been fortunate in hunting. Level 34 puts me low on the <br/>
food chain in EW. I have tried my standard hunting routine from the <br/>
foot of the bridge, but have been beaten back to the zone repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
This last time, I crossed the zone to get away from a mob, and was <br/>
instantly killed by some kind of tracking wolf pack. They took me <br/>
down twice more in the next fifteen minutes. Found someone else <br/>
contending with them when I resurrected. He being a higher level <br/>
offered to train them away, and did so. I got my corpse and got my <br/>
stuff back, but am now a high 33 again. <br/>
<br/>
I may have to rethink my Velious career. Solo at 34 in EW seems a bit <br/>
tough, even if I need the tufts.<br/>
