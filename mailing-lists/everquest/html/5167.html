&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   This is an odd request, but I am looking for some Everquest <br/>
 </span></blockquote>players that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   wouldn&#39;t mind being interviewed either by IM, phone, or if <br/>
 </span></blockquote>practical in person. I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Institute of <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Users, we <br/>

 </span></blockquote>because we <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   think that it is very interesting and complex. As a retired <br/>
 </span></blockquote>online gamer I know <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   how much fun and involving the games can be. In fact, I am very <br/>
 </span></blockquote>tempted to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   jump into Everquest, but I am worried that I may lose <br/>
 </span></blockquote>concentration on my <br/>

 </span></blockquote>helping us out we <br/>

 </span></blockquote>students and will <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   not be able to compensate anyone who helps us out, but we will <br/>
 </span></blockquote>very very <br/>
