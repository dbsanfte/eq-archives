<br/>
Oddly enough you could solo one (well go into one alone). I was in a group of 5 where suddenly we lost two people (before even getting to adv start) and then the other two folk decided to bag the adventure. So, just for Ha-Has, I took my shaman into the adv to do some foraging (some of the rarer forages sell for 50-100pp a pop on the Nameless). Lack of common sense got the better of me and I tried some of the mobs... the first multi-pull sent me running for the exit... :)<br/>

&gt; Well first you have to make sure you have the expansion Lost Dungeons of<br/>
&gt; Norath, once you have that then you join a band of adventures of around your<br/>
&gt; level, maximum of 6 member with a spread of no more then 7 levels between<br/>
&gt; the highest and lowest. The group leader then goes and gets the adventure<br/>
&gt; for the group, sorry but they won&#39;t let a solo in and you all have to have<br/>
&gt; the expansion enabled and have your adventure stones. Just one way they have<br/>
&gt; of making you group with people to have fun and see naked as someone<br/>
&gt; possibly all of you will die on it at some time or another. You&#39;ll have a<br/>
&gt; main looter who loots and then sells after the adventure and splits the<br/>
&gt; proceeds between you all, items drop from the mobs which are no drops and<br/>
&gt; you roll on them, there&#39;s also some pretty nice things drop that you&#39;ll want<br/>
&gt; to roll on.<br/>
