<div><font face="Arial" size="2">All classes have their strengths and weaknesses, 
all can solo, some of which just&nbsp;have a bit more downtime than 
others.&nbsp; all the classes can be used in epic encounters, without a 
doubt.&nbsp; each has it&#39;s little niche it fits into in group play, however, 
some can fit into more than one role.&nbsp; all the classes can go into 
dungeons, but, as a word of advice, you best get very very good at pet control, 
if you plan on taking your pet into many dungeons as a magician.&nbsp; a wizard 
can nuke as well as a magician, and, at certain spell levels, can do 
better.&nbsp; weaknesses in classes can easily be gotten around, and, in time, 
can become second nature in playing style.&nbsp; as far as epic encounters, it 
takes more than you describe, normally it takes several full groups to get to 
those encounters.&nbsp; amongst which, just about all classes are represented, 
depending upon the makeup of your Guild and it&#39;s friends.&nbsp; All in all, your 
choice of class should depend upon what fits you best, and the same goes with 
the choice of race.&nbsp; Each class has a bit different abilities, each has 
it&#39;s own strengths and weaknesses, and all can be dealt with, if you like the 
class.</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yeah the three classes that are &quot;tanks&quot; are 
  Warriors, Paladins and Shadowknights.</font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I guess it depends on if you want to play an 
  important role in epic encounters or be able to solo well.</font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">The classes that seem to be really important in 
  epic encounters are the warrior(defensive), cleric(complete heal), 
  enchanter(haste and clarity), rogue(melee damage), wizard(magic 
  damage)&nbsp;and bard(resistance buffs). The other classes are better if you 
  want to play mostly by yourself, explore, camp items, do quests, and just 
  generally have fun.</font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I am playing a paladin/magician duo right now and 
  they can really destroy what they are fighting, often as many as 4 blues at 
  once.&nbsp;The last classes I tried were enchanter, wizard and ranger and 
  those are all really weak. I wanted to play some classes that could kill exp 
  giving mobs without resorting to&nbsp;any kiting techniques, and actually go 
  into dungeons.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
