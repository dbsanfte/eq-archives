<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101683956">Personally i dont mind the changes they are making.. i feel that they are<br/>
putting new life into the game that was dying.<br/>
<br/>
Give examples of what issues you have.. maybe others here will discuss them.<br/>
Pros and cons like.  I believe the classes are pretty much balanced, each<br/>
one needs time to develop.  Most classes that seem weak in the early levels<br/>
(ie &lt;25 ) show true strength later on.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, what does everyone else think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To your original question, maybe you should look into Shadowbane.. -&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m rather fed up with Verant! They&#39;re constantly nerfing everything ingame <br/>
that&#39;s worth while, or ignoring classes that need to be balanced or <br/>
upgraded! So in retrospect, I&#39;m looking to find greener pastures elsewhere. <br/>
Perhaps someone out there knows of another game (other than AC and UO) or <br/>
perhaps a group who&#39;s programming their own game similar to EQ? If so, <br/>
please don&#39;t hesistate to drop me a line or two via email. Tks in advance!<br/>
