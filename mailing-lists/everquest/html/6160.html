<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318910125">No one knows why Luclin blew up (if I&#39;m remembering right). It&#39;s part<br/>
of the lore of the game we&#39;re supposed to discover.  The Vah Shir are<br/>
gone, but we have the Kerrans now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve a feeling that another moon will be discovered though, according<br/>
to what a lot of the NPCs say.<br/>

&gt; Oh cool!!<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though. Plus EQ2 could be considered a parrallel universe.<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t know Luclin had exploded in EQ2. Did they say the story behind why? What happened to the poor Vah Shir?<br/>
&gt; I imagine in 25 years the game interfaces will be much more advanced. Maybe there will be EQ 1.5 or 1.9A or something. :-D<br/>
