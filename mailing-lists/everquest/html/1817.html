&gt; At level 10, if you can not get one hit in for ONE point before the damage<br/>
&gt; shield kills the mobs, you might want to stop trying to kill the dark reds<br/>
&gt; and stick with black and yellow cons. Damage shields is one of the better<br/>
&gt; tools for power leveling.<br/>
<br/>
Of course. I was talking about LOW level characters, not level 10s. Yes, I<br/>
know, a level 10 is still considered a low level character, but I was<br/>
speaking of newly created characters up to maybe level 3 or 4 that often can<br/>
NOT get in one point of damage before the damage shield kills the mob. </span></blockquote></div>
