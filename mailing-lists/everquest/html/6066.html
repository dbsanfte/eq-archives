&gt; A CLERIC&#39;S DAY<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The morning comes too soon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was another bad night, tortured by the haunted<br/>
&gt; screams, and the <br/>
&gt; vivid images of the previous day. My heart is tired,<br/>
&gt; but I must not <br/>
&gt; falter. I met my comrades on the field. Still and<br/>
&gt; quiet. Only the <br/>
&gt; crickets give evidence of life beyond our keep.<br/>
&gt; Today will be another <br/>
&gt; rough day. I bolster my faith, surrounding myself<br/>
&gt; with it like a <br/>
&gt; piece of impregnable armor. I know that many will go<br/>
&gt; out to meet <br/>
&gt; their death and only a few will return. For all our<br/>
&gt; sakes, I must put <br/>
&gt; that aside and mourn later. For now it is war. I am<br/>
&gt; needed to give <br/>
&gt; heart, faith and healing to my comrades. If I must,<br/>
&gt; I will help as <br/>
&gt; well. Not that someone like me could do much. I pray<br/>
&gt; to Tunare for <br/>
&gt; strength and guidance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All communications are in and the report is not<br/>
&gt; good. Our scouts have <br/>
&gt; given us a target. An army of orcs is controlling<br/>
&gt; the southern path <br/>
&gt; letting us know that we shall not pass. Our troops<br/>
&gt; are ready to move <br/>
&gt; out. I only pray that everyone will return. I look<br/>
&gt; at the faces of <br/>
&gt; those with me, those in my group and those beyond.<br/>
&gt; They are anxious. <br/>
&gt; They know the risks and yet the shouts and glory of<br/>
&gt; victory drive <br/>
&gt; them like a cruel master. They look to me for<br/>
&gt; comfort and to keep <br/>
&gt; them going. I hope I do not fail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We reach the gate, but the enemy is nowhere to be<br/>
&gt; seen. The stink is <br/>
&gt; fresh. Do we venture forth or stay behind where it<br/>
&gt; is safe? Our <br/>
&gt; orders are clear, we must continue forward. We must<br/>
&gt; keep them from <br/>
&gt; penning between our keep and their forces. Group by<br/>
&gt; group we venture <br/>
&gt; forward along the path.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A flash of light and some music. I can&#39;t move. The<br/>
&gt; brutishness of our <br/>
&gt; foes keeps me rooted in place. All around me I hear<br/>
&gt; the screams of <br/>
&gt; agony mixed with their terrible howls of victory.<br/>
&gt; The orcs have <br/>
&gt; surrounded us cutting off our escape route. I see my<br/>
&gt; friends and <br/>
&gt; fellow fighters going down one by one under the<br/>
&gt; cruel swords of the <br/>
&gt; brutish orcs. I am helpless. I see them looking to<br/>
&gt; for help and it <br/>
&gt; breaks my heart. How cruel this enemy is, to leave<br/>
&gt; me with sight and <br/>
&gt; hearing, yet deprive me of movement.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I feel my hands start to glow. I begin the motions,<br/>
&gt; healing as I can, <br/>
&gt; trying to heal those around me that are still<br/>
&gt; standing. I once again <br/>
&gt; summon my faith to provide a bunker for those left<br/>
&gt; as I race to save <br/>
&gt; those who may yet be living. Frantically, I race<br/>
&gt; against time to save <br/>
&gt; one then another hoping I can stay strong. Our<br/>
&gt; enemies, those that <br/>
&gt; threaten my homeland, are strong. I am not sure how<br/>
&gt; much longer I can <br/>
&gt; hold out. I can feel the energy draining away.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Behind me I hear the sound of fresh troops bearing<br/>
&gt; down on us and I <br/>
&gt; send a hurried prayer of thanks to Tunare.<br/>
&gt; Re-enforcements have <br/>
&gt; arrived. Somewhere inside me, I find the power to<br/>
&gt; continue healing <br/>
&gt; and bolstering as much as I can. I watch as our<br/>
&gt; enemies slowly fall <br/>
&gt; beneath our forces until there are none left.<br/>
&gt; Gratefully, I regroup. <br/>
&gt; Looking around, I see that most of us still live.<br/>
&gt; Able to return to <br/>
&gt; our keep victorious.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are celebrations, joyful reunions and tales to<br/>
&gt; be told. I hang <br/>
&gt; back. Today we were lucky; tomorrow we will face<br/>
&gt; death again. How can <br/>
&gt; we hold out? I don&#39;t know, but I cannot give up the<br/>
&gt; faith. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is my calling.<br/>
&gt; My vocation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a cleric.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
