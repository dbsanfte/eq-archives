Sony&#39;s plan to addict all known peoples and make zombies out of them has<br/>
claimed another soul for their army of consumers! Soon the market will<br/>
be flooded with Sony Zombies buying everything related to Sony and<br/>
Everquest. The brainwashing is working perfectly! <br/>
The fools! Do they not realize the power that Sony has over them? <br/>
Do they not realize the contributions they are making to the<br/>
capitalistic ways of the Sony Clan? <br/>
As long as this plan holds there is no telling how far it can go! Sony<br/>
will rule the world!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
(he, he, he. Sorry, don&#39;t know where that came from!) Anyway I really<br/>
need to get back to playing Everquest!<br/>

I guess I got lucky. When I brought EQ home, my boyfriend didn&#39;t seem<br/>
too interested at first since it wasn&#39;t a sport game. But then I left<br/>
him alone one night for about two hours and when I got back, he was<br/>
hooked. A month later we had to get a 2nd computer and a 2nd acct. <br/>
