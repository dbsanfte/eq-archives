<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128320409">After. Everytime I get to server select and try to get to character select.<br/>
I don&#39;t have that problem with World of Warcraft but I think the login system is completely differen. WoW is much faster to load than EQ. Unfortunately to fix EQ would mean serious reprogramming that might not be possible without changing the game completely.<br/>
It tells me to rerun the patcher and I do. I even ran complete file check. I rebooted and closed all programs I didn&#39;t need... I used to be able to connect with my satellite but my connection and has gotten progressively worse. I don&#39;t know if it is Sony&#39;s servers or my ISP. Or both.<br/>
