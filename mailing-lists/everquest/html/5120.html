<div id="ygrps-yiv-66756679">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My husband just bought me the EverQuest Evolution today and I have <br/>
installed it and it looks wonderful but I am having a devil of a <br/>
time trying to figure any of it out.  Are there any sites on the web <br/>
that can help me learn the aspects of this game?  I just keep <br/>
walking around in circles looking at people.<br/>
