<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-485041068"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have a brand spankin&#39; new rogue and I have some questions.  I would<br/>
&gt; greatly appreciate any feedback.<br/>
&gt; 1)  How does &quot;sneak&quot; work exactly?  Can I sneak across someone&#39;s line of<br/>
&gt; sight?  What is the difference between &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; that comes<br/>
 </span></blockquote>later?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sneak can work in front of creatures sometimes. I think. But it works best<br/>
to buy from merchants who won&#39;t sell to you. You can sneak up behind them<br/>
and buy from them. Hide can only be done while holding still.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.  Does it do me any good to<br/>
&gt; attack monsters from behind without the ability yet?  I have been making<br/>
 </span></blockquote>an<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; effort to do just that, but should I not even bother?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find that my chances of hitting a creature first is improved if I go<br/>
behind it. Might not make a diff though. It might just seem like it does.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot recall<br/>
&gt; having ever seen or heard of a trap in EQ.  Can anyone give an example of<br/>
&gt; where and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>
&gt; there is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no idea about that one. I started a rogue recently and haven&#39;t found<br/>
any traps to disarm yet.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Alazais&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s no problem. :-)<br/>
You&#39;re welcome.<br/>
luv,<br/>
