<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I don&#39;t know it is hard to say. I am just not very 
good at most of the aspects of EQ like camping items and meeting people to play 
with. I tend to just go where everyone else my level is and join pickup groups. 
I hate playing alone. It just seems like the game would be ten times better if 
you had a&nbsp;group of friends to play with. </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Welcome back to EQ!<br>I&#39;ve been playing EQ since September 
  of 2000 or so. I obviously enjoy<br>playing. :-) I&#39;m not sure exactly what 
  kind of advice you&#39;re asking for<br>here. Anything specific you need to know 
  about?<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>Hi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. 
  I am not a very good EQ<br>player. I would consider myself ultra competent in 
  group battles, but in<br>other aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I 
  have never gotten a<br>character past level 40. My first character was an 
  Erudite Enchanter by the<br>name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to 
  level 40 after two years or<br>so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which 
  was my friends character but I<br>own it. I just started playing again after 
  giving up on the game and playing<br>DAOC. Eventually I gave up all MMORPGS 
  deciding they were a waste of time.<br>About a week ago, I decided to give EQ 
  another chance and have decided that<br>it has improved a great deal. I am now 
  playing a Human Ranger who is level<br>30. I really like the character. His 
  buffs and damage spells are great. I<br>guess I could use some help on how to 
  be a good EQ player. I have been<br>playing for about two years and I feel 
  like I know absolutely nothing about<br>the game. I have never belonged to a 
  good guild or anything. I play on the<br>Xegony server.<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
