 I&#39;d love to try it to get the feel of what everyone<br/>
went through before the expansions.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
excellent stories from friends who&#39;ve played since the<br/>
beginning, when dropping your first giant would really<br/>
mean something. Just seems it would be a good idea to<br/>
get first had experience of the history in this game.<br/>

&gt; Anyway, in talking to my old EQ chums and with what<br/>
&gt; I read on the <br/>
&gt; websites, there is/has been some talk about SOE<br/>
&gt; making a &quot;classic&quot; <br/>
&gt; server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now the &quot;classic&quot; server would be EQ prior to PoP,<br/>
&gt; no adds or toys, <br/>
&gt; with the exception of the stuff necessary. This<br/>
&gt; would mean no PoK, no <br/>
&gt; Guild Lobby, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Knowing that many of you have been here since around<br/>
&gt; Beta or just after <br/>
&gt; and that most of you can honestly say &quot; I remember<br/>
&gt; when... or Back in <br/>
&gt; the Day we had to run from X t Y and it was 4 day<br/>
&gt; run....&quot;; I am <br/>
&gt; curious to know if any of you kids would use such a<br/>
&gt; server, or have you <br/>
&gt; all become stuck on how things are now that going<br/>
&gt; back to the old way <br/>
&gt; would kill the game for you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As always, but now just plainly nosey..<br/>
