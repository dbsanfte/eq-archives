<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432321608">Around 4 years back I made a female toon and named<br/>
it after my wife.  There was a big difference in the<br/>
way this toon was treated by others.  I got healed<br/>
more and rarely died all kinda people wanted to help<br/>
me and if you flirted them little wood elf eyes about<br/>
bam groups started looking you.  <br/>
   So I created another female wood elf this time a<br/>
druid.  I was having trouble getting levels with my<br/>
male druid.  At level 7 another female druid came up<br/>
to me gave me all her lv 34 gear.  She said she was<br/>
fed up with the game and wanted to pass her stuff on<br/>
to another sister druid.   She sat down camped and<br/>
deleted her account.<br/>
   Today my druid is my highest lv toon and still my<br/>
best dressed toon.  The guys don&#39;t flirt and hit on me<br/>
as much anymore.  I think they finally realized it<br/>
just my be a dude sitting there behind them keys. LOL<br/>
