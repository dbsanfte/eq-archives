<b>Subject:</b> Re: Cash and experience <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058979929">I spent most of my last big cash reserve on wis gear. Just thinking <br/>
of adding an item or two in the future. You are right, the money <br/>
won&#39;t be critical until I get closer to my next spell level. Just <br/>
wondering if I could do both.<br/>
<br/>
At present I spend part of my time in Velious, getting exp. The other <br/>
part I spend in Misty Thicket, foraging Misty Acorns. I have found a <br/>
minor money mine there. Running around looking for the ground drops <br/>
of acorns is not too productive. Forage, though rare, is better. So, <br/>
while I wait for forage to clear, I kill the conveniently grouped <br/>
diseased rats. The 1pp tails and a few stackable high-gold items make <br/>
the time at least somewhat productive.<br/>
<br/>
The present course, until it gets just too boring, is hunt kitties <br/>
for one bubble of exp, then off to Misty until I find an acorn. Then <br/>
back to Velious for another round.<br/>
<br/>
Starting to feel like a job. ;)<br/>

&gt; What do you need the cash really for? Meaning, if you<br/>
&gt; made lots of cash then why not just find a place where<br/>
&gt; the exp is Excellent.  My attitude is you can always<br/>
&gt; make money in the higher levels.  Or take up a trade<br/>
&gt; like pottery and get your skill up to make things that<br/>
&gt; sell for good PP.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my 2 cents...... I have a 32 druid and currently<br/>
&gt; hunt in the Overthere and I find the PP good as well<br/>
&gt; as the exp.  But I am grouping since lots of baddies<br/>
&gt; resist spells.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have been hunting Snow Cougars in Iceclad for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; level and a half. <br/>
&gt; &gt; The experience is good, and whether solo or duo the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time invested is <br/>
&gt; &gt; about the same. Not bad, but I am not making any<br/>
&gt; &gt; money.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Previously I farmed Brutes in Warsliks Woods.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nominal experience, but <br/>
&gt; &gt; made lots of cash.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Any ideas where I can go as a lvl 35 Druid to get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; good balance of <br/>
&gt; &gt; cash/loot and experience? Mostly I solo, as I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; usually in for an <br/>
&gt; &gt; hour at a time. Get in a few hours together now and<br/>
&gt; &gt; then, but for <br/>
&gt; &gt; short sessions getting a group consumes most of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time available.<br/>
