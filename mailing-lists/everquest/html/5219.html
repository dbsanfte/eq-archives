<b>Subject:</b> Very Nice EQ Movie <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648967174">Hi Everyone, <br/>
<br/>
     I wanted to share with you a very nice EQ movie I found some <br/>
time ago online. I warn you though I found it to be very touching and <br/>
filled with emotion. It is a big flash movie and took me about an <br/>
hour to load on my 56k connection, but it is worth the wait, it is <br/>
truly unforgettable. When you first visit the link it will ask you to <br/>
download a japanese language pack, just click cancel to that, you can <br/>
view the movie perfectly fine without it. I hope you all enjoy it as <br/>
much as I did, please reply with your thoughts and feelings about the <br/>
movie after you watch it.<br/>
<br/>
