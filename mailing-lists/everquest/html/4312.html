<div id="ygrps-yiv-728127458">Yeah, it may just be random. I talked to someone who had a problem with his<br/>
bank and after only having his account cancelled for one month came back to<br/>
discover all his gear gone. Could&#39;ve been bc of servers going down with<br/>
problems and such. Or the guy could&#39;ve been making it up..<br/>

&gt; Not really trying to argue here  but I have canceled my account 3<br/>

4 months. But when I logged back on, all was well. Nothing moved, no gear<br/>
missing... I litterally did pick up where I left off.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; EverQuest holds onto your unused and unpaid for accounts for six<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; months before deleting it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; No, they guarantee they won&#39;t delete accounts for 6 months, but they<br/>
&gt; &gt; have never yet actually deleted an inactive account. I know of several<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who have returned after a year or more and just reactivated their<br/>
&gt; &gt; account<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I have heard reports of people having their gear and money deleted<br/>
&gt; while their characters and levels were still there. So there&#39;s no<br/>
