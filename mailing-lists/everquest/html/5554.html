<div id="ygrps-yiv-50289676">The Gulf of Gunthak is a good area to start hunting in with a group,<br/>
especially with all the undead on the beach area.  Other than that some<br/>
people head to Lake of Ill Omen to hunt sarnaks and goblins.  See if either<br/>
of those areas are good for you.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Where to go from here?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So I&#39;ve actually been reading this forum for quite a while, but<br/>
&gt; never had reason to post. I got started playin EQ a few months ago,<br/>
&gt; on a friend&#39;s account, and got my bard to lvl 34 before he pretty<br/>
&gt; much wouldn&#39;t let me play anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I&#39;ve got my own account, and my main is a lvl 31 cleric. Getting<br/>
&gt; there was pretty easy, I just did everything I&#39;d already done<br/>
&gt; before. One of my RL friends helps me whenever he&#39;s on, but we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; always be on at the same time, and he&#39;s usually busy off on some<br/>
&gt; raid with his guild. Plus I&#39;m getting tired of bugging him all the<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So where do I go from here? Where are the best places for xp? Are<br/>
&gt; there any quests or anything that I should be doing, and what? I<br/>
&gt; would very much appreciate any suggestions.<br/>
