Umm yeah. If you had read the whole box, you probably would have noticed it says &quot;Valid credit card required.&quot; written in bold capital letters on the rear. <br/>
<br/>
 If you dont have a credit card, try seeing if a good friend of yours might let you charge it to his/her credit card. Or maybe your parents. Another option would be to open a checking account, at a bank, that has a Visa Check Card instead of a plain ol&#39; debit card. Works just like a credit card but the money just comes directly out of you checking account. <br/>
