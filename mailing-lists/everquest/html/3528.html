<div id="ygrps-yiv-140387520"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I agree with Barto Su, Don&#39;t give up. It will happen someday. Here let<br/>
&gt; me tell you my story and see if you feel any better ok?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Huh? You can&#39;t give up something you never tried. lol. I&#39;m not feeling bad<br/>
or anything. I just don&#39;t give a rats ass. lol.<br/>
I don&#39;t want to date anyone or anything like that. Just not interested. It<br/>
would probably cut into my EQ gaming time too much.<br/>
I&#39;m happy being single.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Back in 1988 I met this girl going to the local Jr. college in the town<br/>
&gt; I was living in. I was a senior in high school and we really hit it off.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll call her &quot;K&quot;, K and I were always together and I soon fell madly in<br/>
&gt; love with her. Soon the school year came to a close, things were<br/>
&gt; changing a little for us, I actually cut my waist long hair so her<br/>
&gt; parents wouldn&#39;t freak! Yea, I really liked her!<br/>
&gt; Well after she moved back to Denver I got a phone call from her. She<br/>
&gt; wanted to break up and see other people. Of course I was devastated,<br/>
&gt; (I&#39;m one of those sappy sensitive types), and it was hard. I agreed<br/>
&gt; because I really didn&#39;t have the experience in relationships to try and<br/>
&gt; work something out. Well two weeks pass and my graduation came. K shows<br/>
&gt; up to go to my graduation, which was cool and all but the night before<br/>
&gt; we get into this nasty fight. We&#39;re cruising along and there is a truck<br/>
&gt; full of some of my female friends fom school and they are drunk off<br/>
&gt; their ass! They&#39;re whopin&#39; and hollarin&#39; having a good ol&#39; time. Well K<br/>
&gt; suddenly jumps out of the passenger seat and practically into my lap.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t look at them.&quot; She says to me as she entwines her arm in mine.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Excuse me? You broke up with me remember?&quot; I said back to her, &quot;I can<br/>
&gt; look at whomever I want!&quot; granted it probably wasn&#39;t the most mature way<br/>
&gt; to put it but either way we ended up into a fight. So we came home and<br/>
&gt; went to bed. (I left a bunch of non-important stuff out to save time,<br/>
&gt; btw nothing happened.)<br/>
&gt; The next morning I woke up before she did. I was lying there looking at<br/>
&gt; her and thinking this will be the last time we see each other. So I<br/>
&gt; stroke her arm ans she wakes up. We start to kiss and one thing leads to<br/>
&gt; another. It was my first time mind you so I was really nervous about<br/>
&gt; that and to top it off, my Mother was asleep in the next room! So<br/>
&gt; afterwards I ask the usual guy question, of &quot;How was I&quot; and her response<br/>
&gt; was &quot;I&#39;ve had bigger.&quot; SMAK! Oh that hurt! I was destroyed, whether or<br/>
&gt; not it was true, (My wife says she&#39;s full of crap!), it really hurt.<br/>
&gt; This began a 7 year drought for me. I completely shut myself off. I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t date, never went out, got into stamp collecting. ;D Man it was<br/>
&gt; rough! So finally to make an incredibly long story a little shorter I<br/>
&gt; finally got back into the dating scene. I put an ad out on<br/>
&gt; coloradosingles.com which was a great site because I&#39;ll never meet<br/>
&gt; someone say in Pennsylvania! I don&#39;t suggest going to that site now<br/>
&gt; because they are now a &quot;swinger&#39;s&quot; site, unless of course your into<br/>
&gt; that. :-)<br/>
&gt; So now you know that love can happen but it just takes time. Hey are you<br/>
&gt; going to the Denver Everquest Meetup? <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.meetup.com/">http://everquest.meetup.com/</a> I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; going to meet some fellow CO Eqer&#39;s. Who know, you might meet that<br/>
&gt; someone! ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sharing. :-)<br/>
Glad things worked out for you in the end. :-)<br/>
I&#39;m stuck on the farm taking care of my animals so I can&#39;t go to conventions<br/>
and stuff.<br/>
I&#39;m a low energy person. I do not have the energy to deal with people all<br/>
the time. Nor do I have the desire to expend energy to work on a<br/>
relationship. I&#39;m just extremely lazy. Too lazy to bother with a<br/>
relationship. And I don&#39;t feel any need to find someone. I like things the<br/>
way they are.<br/>
luv,<br/>
