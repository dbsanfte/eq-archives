<div><font face="Arial" size="2">you should definitely work on all weapon 
skills...&nbsp; just keep an eye on you skill, as it goes up, so that you know 
when to switch to a different weapon.&nbsp; the formula for weapons skills is 
this:&nbsp; (level * 5) +5&nbsp; so, at 11, your skill should max at 60.&nbsp; 
as soon as your skill hits 60 with one weapon, switch to a different 
skill.&nbsp; do this each level, if you can.&nbsp; i neglected to do this with 
my ranger, and am now paying for it.&nbsp; i am trying to raise my 2hb, and 1hb 
from nothing, and am level 42.....&nbsp; which means, since i solo, i take much 
more dmg than i should, because of being so slow to kill the mob with those 
weapons....&nbsp; when you get dual wield, it will be easier for you to keep 
1hs, piercing, and 1hb maxed, as you can slip 1 of each type into a hand, and 
still do a considerable amount of dmg, while increasing 2 skills at once.&nbsp; 
hope this helps..</font></div>

  question</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>Ok, I have a level 11 warrior and would like 
  your<br>opinion on the following:<br><br>I started wondering why I was not 
  hitting that much<br>with him even though he has a good weapon. After 
  some<br>research, I found that the reason I am not hitting as<br>much as 
  others is because I have been switching<br>between 2HS and 1HS weapons to 
  increase the skills of<br>each attribute.&nbsp; <br><br>Example: My skill in 
  both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br>attack is at like 152.&nbsp; If I were to just 
  use 1HS<br>let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br><br>I have 
  proved this because now that I am using the 1HS<br>more, the skill is close to 
  30 and my ATK rating is<br>close to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is still 
  at<br>152.<br><br><br>Would you continue to alternate both weapon types 
  or<br>would you just pick one and go with 
  it?<br><br>THanks<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do
