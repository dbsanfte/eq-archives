<div id="ygrps-yiv-927083955">Tuldayen Grimblade Has a great point here. See, I spend way to much time<br/>
soloing. Well at least with Durgaa, she&#39;s kind of a lone wolf as it is.<br/>
(it&#39;s a ranger thing LOL!) <br/>
<br/>
I try to group with my others though, especially my Druid. Group skill are<br/>
pretty important, I&#39;ve been in several &quot;groups&quot; that have just been all over<br/>
the place and ended up getting creamed by pretty easy mobs for that group.<br/>
It&#39;s mostly due to the group consisting of mostly tanks or casters. The<br/>
Tanks usually end up running all over the place and the casters usually end<br/>
up running all over the place trying to stay alive. I usually try to form<br/>
groups and specify that I need a little of all classes. It&#39;s tough forming<br/>
them but usually pays off once I get them formed. <br/>
