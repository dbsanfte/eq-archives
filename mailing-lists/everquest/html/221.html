<div id="ygrps-yiv-161346881">Are you sure about that? That doesnt seem to make<br/>
sense. The only reason I can think of is that when you<br/>
load a zone you need to recieve lots of packets<br/>
containing info on the position and status of each NPC<br/>
and PC in the zone. What items are for sale for how<br/>
much and what kinda loot each mob has although that<br/>
info could wait untill the kill. I also thought maybe<br/>
the Eq each PC was carrying would have to be<br/>
transfered as well. Or at least the texture map for<br/>
each diferent item and which character might be<br/>
associated with which particular texture map. <br/>
After the zone is loaded you only need to recieve<br/>
updates. Also obviuosly the graphics change but these<br/>
are locally stored and load rather quickly. I think if<br/>
the Zone was on a different server it would load<br/>
quicker. As each physical machine is supporting fewer<br/>
players they can spend more time sending info and less<br/>
time crunching data. I agree about pipe and processor<br/>
size I have a cable modem and an AMD 333 and I zone in<br/>
about 8-10 seconds sometimes faster depending on the<br/>
zone and I would guess how crowded it is. <br/>

&gt; The reason it takes so long to go from zone to zone<br/>
&gt; is your going to another <br/>
&gt; server.<br/>
