<p>Just kidding, In the &#39;Update&#39;/Patch that was downloaded, do you keep records of such downloads?&nbsp;Such as a Utility program that monitors Downloads other than WinXP? (that is rather vague, Norton Clean Sweep, or something like it)?</p>
<p>I have found that when EQ Updates that if I do not monitor it, &nbsp;the PC I use for Games sometimes becomes unstable. Maybe its a Sony thing, could be a&nbsp;OS Fault, just point is to Monitor All Downloads. I also use CD-RW (external) to create&nbsp;Data files of Registry&nbsp;and Critical Programs&nbsp;on. </p>
<p>I ran the figures and it works out to about $0.25 per Backup CD when bought by 50 or 100. That figure includes the cost of internal CD-RW.Nothing is better in Electronic Computing than a reliable Backup, and if one relies on Windows to store said backups, well is kinda tough to Boot a PC if the OS goes flakey, (which&nbsp;happens).</p>
<p>In summation, That Sys Restore is a handy little Utility, but I don&#39;t trust it with Important Files. </p>
<p>The reason I mentioned External CD-RW is because you are using a Laptop, what the heck,&nbsp;is a good&nbsp;thing to have just in case your Laptop ever gets run over by a Fire Truck,Eaten by a Dog, Decides it is Esther Williams,&nbsp;or something. </p>
