<div id="ygrps-yiv-476466796">Well, certain classes are able to solo mobs. I think skill is not the only issue. It&#39;s also a matter of gear, class, and internet connection. Classes with pets, slows, and snares have an advantage. Sure clerics can heal themselves, but only if they don&#39;t get interrupted. Since omens came out I have been fizzling a LOT more for no reason. Plus I have satellite internet which causes some upload latency. The way the damage system is setup I get damage misreports and take 100+ damage from an 18 damage hit. I was nearly owned by green mobs in straightup melee even with haste and a delay 18 weapon with a proc. My spells were interrupted, I lagged and couldn&#39;t get other spells off, and root was breaking instantly. I was told that if I had ornate or elemental armor I would have a better chance soloing.<br/>
I just wish they had tasks categorized as easy, medium, and difficult, as well as short, medium, etc.. <br/>
Zoning can take a long time for me so running from DL to Sebilis can take more time than I want to spend doing a task.<br/>
I agree that it would be nice to get a more tangible reward.<br/>

I agree - even at lower levels the missions are tough.<br/>
<br/>
My level 12 enchanter was recently sent to Unrest to kill 10 <br/>
Tormented Dead.   This would normally not be too big a deal, as they <br/>
con mostly DB to me. the problem is the Death Beetles that wander <br/>
around the outside that all aggro on you when you attack one of the <br/>
dead.   I died once, and had to train three times to zone - and this <br/>
was a &quot;medium mission&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The one before was incredibly easy - I had to run to the center of a <br/>
goblin camp, I had to run to pok, then I had to speak to someone in <br/>
field of bone.  All easy actions for a level 12 enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
Now I do have to somewhat defend the system.  I believe these quests <br/>
may be soloable, but they require intense skill.  I am not very <br/>
skilled with my enchanter yet, which may be why I&#39;m having a <br/>
problem. (I am not implying anything about anyone elses play skill - <br/>
this is just my observation on my characters)<br/>
<br/>
I also recieved a mission for my level 51 shaman to go to lower guk <br/>
and kill 10 Dar Ghoul Knights.  I had never been to Lower Guk, and I <br/>
honestly enjoyed it down there - I made nearly 100 pp from killing <br/>
the greenies and picked up some items that I have sold in the bazaar <br/>
for an extra 250 pp.  I am very skilled with my shaman, as he is the <br/>
third one I have ever had.  So the mission doesn&#39;t seem as bad <br/>
(though still very hard).  <br/>
<br/>
I have sent feedback, there are some things I want them to implement:<br/>
<br/>
** Titles for people who complete a large number of missions<br/>
** Adventure points of some sort would be nice - get rewards other <br/>
than just plat (I would like a trophey).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind them being hard - I just want to have something more <br/>
tangible to prove I did it, besides some xp and money (though maybe <br/>
I been playing to much fable).</div>
