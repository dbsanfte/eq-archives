<div id="ygrps-yiv-695618558">I agree with Allakhazam Premium membership being great.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need it to look up quests or items, but with premium you <br/>
have the options of searches.  <br/>
<br/>
Its very useful if you want to search out a quest in a zone or how <br/>
many quests Heritic Heads can be used in.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, its not necessary, and if your just starting EQ, you can <br/>
probably get away with normal membership. But there are some great <br/>
benefits if you start getting really serious about the game.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally I love the forums there!<br/>

Allakhazam has been far more useful than any guides.<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re going to spend money, why not spend it on allakhazam <br/>
instead of buying a guide.<br/>
&gt; Although free guides would be ideal.<br/>
&gt; Oh, if any new members have messages pending, I apologize as yahoo <br/>
will not let me approve or reject them at the moment. It&#39;s being <br/>
pissy and saying the service is unavailable at the time.<br/>

&gt; In any case that any of these actually worked without the use of a <br/>
&gt; spell (I mean really fly through the air, whats to say the &quot;tip&quot; <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t just buy a ring of levitation, find a high part to start and <br/>
&gt; run off) then the other possiblities is they are hacks or they are <br/>
&gt; random pathing issues, or they are basically just fancy use of hot <br/>
&gt; keys.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is the *same person* who was previously selling a guide on <br/>
how <br/>
&gt; to make plat (one I bought when I first started playing because I <br/>
&gt; was young and stupid then)- it basically was a bunch of quests I <br/>
&gt; could find on Allakazam that were repeatable and &quot;tips&quot; like kill <br/>
&gt; things and sell the items to players.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In all cases, every guide like this in the past has been filled <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; out dated, in accurate, or information that is not always <br/>
&gt; repeatable. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; An exploit of a bug is only useful if you can consistently repeat <br/>
it. </span></blockquote></div>
