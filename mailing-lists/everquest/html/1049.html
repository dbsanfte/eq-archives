<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947365172">Well, Onelist was bought up by Egroups, and then Yahoo bought Egroups.<br/>
If you want to edit your information you go to www.yahoogroups.com<br/>
It will ask you for your email address to login-- I think.<br/>
If you don&#39;t currently have an account with yahoo you have to transfer your<br/>
egroups account (which was automatically transferred by onelist) to yahoo.<br/>
You can then edit your options.<br/>

I signed up when this was with onelist and I dont have a damn clue how to<br/>
change receiving options or remove myself from the list.. any suggestions?<br/>

at the bottom</div>
