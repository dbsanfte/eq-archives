<div id="ygrps-yiv-938125503">I know it&#39;s a game but it&#39;s sad to think the poor Vah Shir would be gone. Although Shar Vahl layout totally sucked... Maybe the lag there was so bad it caused the moon to implode from all the sucking.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Oh cool!!<br/>
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though. Plus EQ2 could be <br/>
&gt;&gt; considered a parrallel universe.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t know Luclin had exploded in EQ2. Did they say the story behind <br/>
&gt;&gt; why? What happened to the poor Vah Shir?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Seems according to Sony&#39;s plans the Vah Shir were all wiped out when it <br/>
&gt;went.  But dont worry you can still be a cat in the game, just as a Kerra. <br/>
&gt;Kerra were originally (by EQ lore) 4 tribes that united as one.  The Vah <br/>
&gt;Shir were only 1 of those 4.  When they got blown to the moon the other 3 <br/>
&gt;seperated going to the 3 areas they flurish in EQ, Kerra Isle, Erud&#39;s <br/>
&gt;Crossing, and Stonebrunt Mountains.  But don&#39;t count the Vah Shir bloodlines <br/>
&gt;out yet, they could have had some living with the Kerra on Norrath when <br/>
&gt;Luclin went boom.  As for why it went boom....I&#39;m still looking for lore on <br/>
&gt;that. <br/>
