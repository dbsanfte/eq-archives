<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732120916">Thanks again for all of the suggestions! Really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
I already have the VM set to max - no problem with all of the <br/>
available disk space.<br/>
<br/>
It seems most of you are pointing to the Video controller as the <br/>
likely solution. Could well be - the existing one is only 16MB. But <br/>
why would a slow video cause such a hit on the hard disk, which seems <br/>
to be viusally where the bottleneck is - i.e. on zoning, the hard <br/>
disk is very active until it zones are goes back to the server <br/>
screen. The hard disk is performing extremely well and is very fast, <br/>
so that is not the problemin itself - could the slwo graphics card <br/>
cause EQ to go to the hard disk more to compensate?<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure I could go to a 128MB graphics card - would 64Mb do?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks once again.<br/>
<br/>
Regards.<br/>

on my WinME-based EQ box... yup, consider me convinced, fully and <br/>
truly. Likewise the amount of sheer ABUSE my LAN server gets, and the <br/>
stability and speed difference once the VM was fixed to reflect <br/>
changes in real ram.Overall, spending $50 for a Geforce 2 will be an <br/>
investment you&#39;re likely to be pleased with. Also, if your power <br/>
supply is wimpy, consider invest in a bigger one...300 watts should <br/>
be plenty for a Geforce 2 and sufficient cooling for everything, but <br/>
250 will do the trick with less breathing room...any less, upgrade.<br/>
