<div id="ygrps-yiv-881855890">Getting into well-balanced groups will level you more quickly than <br/>
solo hunting. If you get a power leveling friend, all the better. If <br/>
someone can give you stuff, buffs and keep you healed while you fight <br/>
yellows and reds, you go up fast.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer taking my time moving up, more in the way of roll-playing. <br/>
Seeking new experieces, planning trips and adventures.<br/>

&gt; What is a good way to level up fast.   Meaning, I see<br/>
&gt; people say things like I can get from level 3-6 in<br/>
&gt; around an hour.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, the other day, I was on 5 hours and just leveled<br/>
&gt; once.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a Newbie should we venture to more hostile grounds<br/>
&gt; with others to level?  Should we go to the same types<br/>
&gt; of places as a group but not form a group so I can<br/>
&gt; level faster?  Or just stay in the newbie area until<br/>
&gt; we get there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enough for now<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later all helpfuls.....<br/>
