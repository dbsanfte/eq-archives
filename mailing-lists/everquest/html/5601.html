<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116461115">Well, it can still be easier if you aren&#39;t kos. But you have to do a LOT of killing. I found that killing the orcs, gnolls, and bandits (Dalishea, Brenon, and Greth Trucksorn) in Highpass is good faction-- and you can make some decent coin. Killing the 3 bandits I named raises your faction with Highpass Guards, Karana Residents, and Circle of Unseen Hands. Only thing it lowers is your faction with bandits.<br/>

I have a friend that ran a Rogue and was no worse that dubious in <br/>
ever city but Cabalis.  He also has a Troll that can go in most light <br/>
cities.  It&#39;s a long and hard road to follow, and as has been said <br/>
PoK makes it a moot point.  <br/>
