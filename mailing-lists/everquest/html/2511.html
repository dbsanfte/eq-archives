<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kelethin itself is no problem, it&#39;s the morons you<br/>
deal with near Orc Hill that make it difficult. ;) The<br/>
best bet for anyone who&#39;s brand new to the game is to<br/>
level up to 4th or 5th level near newbie lift killing<br/>
bats, decaying skeletons, orc pawns, etc. then just<br/>
totally skip Orc Hill and get a TP to West<br/>
Commonlands. WC is a little high level for you by that<br/>
point, but EC is great, and although it&#39;s a LAST<br/>
resort (and a rather embarassing one IMHO), there are<br/>
a lot of high levels around in EC and near the druid<br/>
circle in WC for a bailout if necessary. I always hate<br/>
mentioning stuff like that cause people tend to take<br/>
it too far and beg for buffs etc, but if it&#39;s an<br/>
occasional thing, it&#39;s better than dying and most<br/>
people don&#39;t mind. Just don&#39;t do it repeatedly. (like<br/>
twice in the same night :P)<br/>
