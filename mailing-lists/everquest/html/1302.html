<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012094086">Yeah, but I needed the xp and didn&#39;t want to leave Highpass. If I&#39;d pissed<br/>
him off he could&#39;ve easily disbanded me. I&#39;ve had people disband me from<br/>
group bc they were pissed off that I couldn&#39;t heal them in time (like one<br/>
time in Crushbone when I kept getting hit by Legos-- the group leader didn&#39;t<br/>
believe me that I kept getting hit. She claimed that I wasn&#39;t even trying to<br/>
heal her).<br/>
Although onetime we had a group leader who was such a jerk that we all sent<br/>
tells to each other and regrouped without him. We had to put him on ignore.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yeah. Sometimes you group with the only people available though. Like in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Highpass if you need in a group you&#39;re stuck with the people camping the<br/>
&gt; &gt; room you want to camp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had mostly good experiences with looting but there are a few people<br/>
&gt; &gt; who&#39;ve given me trouble. One thing that pissed me off-- I was group<br/>
