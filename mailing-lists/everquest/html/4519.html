<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What version of directx 
are you using?&nbsp; I asked Sony and they still do not support&nbsp; DirectX 
9.&nbsp; They told me I should continue to use DX 8.1 and they don&#39;t know when 
DX 9 will be testedfor the use with the game.&nbsp; Teh last time i Had a 
problem with that type of isuue was after a patch and I had it a few times when 
I was using Win xp.&nbsp; Wjen ii switched back to using Win ME i no longer got 
problems like that.&nbsp; Now the lonly problem I have is everytime i&nbsp; log 
onto the game I have to change my languae back to 
common.</font></div></html></div>
