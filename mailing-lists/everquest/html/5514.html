<div id="ygrps-yiv-232475118">Ok, I&#39;m new to this group and to playing EQ.  <br/>
<br/>
My questions may be redundant to those asked by others here or even <br/>
off the wall but her goes.<br/>
<br/>
Does any one use begging?<br/>
<br/>
I have built mine to 23 (not real hi I know but the character is only <br/>
9th level) so far all it has done is get me 2 copper and attacked <br/>
twice.  Not good odds (one attack per copper).<br/>
<br/>
Why do I have direction sense?  And why would you buy a compass?<br/>
<br/>
I have a compass on my screen.  I already know what direction I am <br/>
facing.  My direction sense is at 200 and it still only works about <br/>
60% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
As a monk, how do I improve my safe fall skill without spending all <br/>
my points on it?<br/>
<br/>
I keep jumping off tall things and taking damage but no improvement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why are all the characters white?  What if I want to play a black <br/>
person?<br/>
<br/>
Well that&#39;s about it for now.  I look foreword (because my eyes are <br/>
in the front of my head :P ) to your answers.<br/>
