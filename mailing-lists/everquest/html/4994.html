<div id="ygrps-yiv-490893972"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Hollowshade? What do people hunt in hollowshade for smithing?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do you mean Dawnshroud Peaks? I know if hoppers are up and someone wants<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; gorangas up they kill the age old hopper...<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; So I take it you never heard of the smithing quest out of Shar Vahl.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is a smithing quest there that you can use to get to 250 for little money,<br/>
&gt; just need to do a lot of farming.  There are two mobs there that drop the<br/>
&gt; items needed for smithing.  The owlbears and sonic wolves drop different<br/>
&gt; substances that are used together with metal rings to make humming<br/>
&gt; orbs...these triv around 180 making it easy to get smithing up for just<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cost of making the rings...no water needed.  The only problem is these<br/>
&gt; substances drop the most often when the mobs control the islands in the<br/>
&gt; south of the Hollowshade zone.  That being the case most people trigger<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; war to get the owlbears or sonic wolves to overrun the grimling there and<br/>
&gt; make the islands their home.  once you reach 180 or so in smithing you can<br/>
&gt; start making Shadowscream armor.  Forgot what piece it was, but one part<br/>
&gt; trivs at 208, another around 225, and the boots triv at 250+.  For just<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cost of the mold, the cost of making the humming orbs, and the swirling<br/>
&gt; shadows...you can get your smithing to GM.  Is that not reason enough to<br/>
&gt; camp the mobs in Hollowshade?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow! Cool, I didn&#39;t know that. I&#39;ll have to look into that. :-)<br/>
What are the specific substances that drop that are needed for smithing?<br/>
Know any good places for tailoring? I got mine to 167.<br/>
Thanks for the info!<br/>
luv,<br/>
