<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-298917015">I do wonder how many people will jump to EQ2 when it comes out. I<br/>
don&#39;t even know myself if I will move or stick here. Sometimes I feel<br/>
like moving, sometimes I want to keep at this version. I seem to be<br/>
playing less and less, for various reasons. <br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to get in on the beginning of the game. Be part of<br/>
the discovery, part of a new economy. On the other hand, I have spent<br/>
two years on this game, and there is a lot invested in the original<br/>
version. Not to mention that only recently did my son get a computer<br/>
able to play the full game in all it&#39;s glory.<br/>
<br/>
Still a decision for the future. May be that we will have accounts in<br/>
both games, though where I will get the time to play on both I don&#39;t<br/>
know. I don&#39;t retire for at least seven more years. Now then I shall<br/>
become a full-time gamer. Oh, yeah!<br/>

buying the game if you&#39;re not willign to shell out the money per month.<br/>

&gt;   does it cost anymore than just buying the game any other hidden<br/>

&gt;     Would buying EQ be worth it right now considering that EQ2 is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>coming out in February or March?  I bought EQ in july for about 50<br/>
bucks and a month later they came out with the package deal that had<br/>
all expansions except LDON and it also had loy in it which i stil<br/>
don&#39;t have for 30 bucks.  Of course thats the gaming industry way hehe.   <br/>
