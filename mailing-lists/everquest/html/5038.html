<div id="ygrps-yiv-988604112">I just did shar vahl essence from 102 on up. I just gathered a bunch of<br/>
payala fruit then went and killed a bunch of desert madmen for water so I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to buy water... Actually came out with a profit even though I<br/>
couldn&#39;t sell the shar vahl essence to any players. It was fun. :-)<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; One problem with the war is it can screw up the zone until the server<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is reset.  They have patched it but it still breaks, though less<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; often.  But it is fun!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want to increase your brewing cheaply just gather Payala fruit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Shadeweaver Thicket and combine it with water.  It&#39;s a ground drop<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so anyone can find it.  Just look for the blue topped trees.  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; makes Shar Val essence, triv at 180+.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Heh. Got my brewing to 184 so far. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; A couple months ago I practiced going around the trees in the zone and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>got<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; it down so that by the time I got back to the starting point the fruit<br/>
&gt; &gt; repopped. Got lots of lots of the payala fruit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is Shar Vahl essence good for anything? I have tons of it.<br/>
