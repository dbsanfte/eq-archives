<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666456111">Wow...thank you!  That will be quite helpful.  I&#39;ve already got 2 songs<br/>
that I hang between till the one fades (being only 3rd level, and the 2nd<br/>
level one ends when you quit singing it.)<br/>
<br/>
Do the effects of your songs last longer when you quit singing them as you<br/>
go up in level?<br/>
<br/>
A question on the 3rd level song, the Jig.  It says I feel this energy go<br/>
thru my body, I was wondering what the effects of the song are?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and don&#39;t play the AoE song in a mob filled area.  Ouch.<br/>
<br/>

Timing in Everquest is made up by ticks. One tick is 6 seconds. Bard songs<br/>
are either instants or 3 ticks long. If you manage to time it perfectly<br/>
with<br/>
the ticks on the server you can hold 4 songs up without any misses. This<br/>
require a lot of training and a very good connection AND a very good sense<br/>
of timing.<br/>
<br/>
Three songs is the norm and all bards worth the name should be able to<br/>
handle this with an ok con if you put your mind to it.<br/>
<br/>
The macro that was described works ok in non-combat situations. In combat<br/>
its a lot better to just twist manually. If you get a missed note in the<br/>
beginning of the macro you cant start any songs at all until the macro<br/>
finishes which is not acceptable in combat.<br/>
<br/>
If you read some of the articles written by Thott (guildleader of Afterlife<br/>
on Mithaniel Marr) he does a good job in describing timings and mechanics<br/>
of<br/>
a bard.<br/>
<br/>
Some people claim to be able to do 5 songs but to my knowledge this is not<br/>
possible without &quot;faking it&quot; with for example Breath of Harmony that procs<br/>
&quot;NivÂ´s melody of preservation&quot;. Thus you can hold 5 effects in the air and<br/>
REALLY impress people around you. just hotkey 4 songs and hit them in order<br/>
and keep it timed. Thats the life of a bard. Also Instruments boost the<br/>
effect of many songs VERY much. Many times its worth NOT meleeing and just<br/>
twist songs and sometimes instruments too. Always remember - youre not a<br/>
tank. After playing bard over two years now i can say the best thing about<br/>
bards is that they are good at minimizing downtime. And boy downtime sucks.<br/>
<br/>
To time the ticks are used by other classes aswell but not as much as the<br/>
bards. But some casters use tick-med as a technique.<br/>

     Nice!  Never knew that would work!  You just gave life back to my<br/>

&gt; Playing more than one song at a time is possible (and as far as I<br/>
&gt; know not a bug, just a matter of being able to hit the keys fast<br/>
&gt; enough) because the effects of a song continue for a few seconds after<br/>
&gt; you stop singing it.  So, starting and stopping and restarting songs fast<br/>
&gt; enough will allow you to have multiple song effects active all at the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>same<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; time.  I think 3 songs at a time is what most people try to manage.  The<br/>
&gt; best method I&#39;ve seen to do this is by programming a hotkey that would<br/>
&gt; look something like this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; /pause 30;/sing 1<br/>
&gt; /pause 30;/sing 2<br/>
&gt; /pause 30;/sing 3<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When you hit this hotkey, it would start song in spell slot 1, wait 3<br/>
&gt; seconds, start song in spell slot 2, wait 3 seconds, then start song in<br/>
&gt; spell slot 3.  When you notice the effects of song 1 fading, you hit the<br/>
&gt; hot key again and it starts over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a lvl 5 bard char which I have only played a little.  If anyone<br/>
&gt; knows of better ways to twist songs I would like to hear them.<br/>
