<div><font face="Arial" size="2">First off, I agree with you.&nbsp; Weddings held in 
/shout or /ooc are a bad idea.&nbsp; Plus it defeats the entire reason why 
channels were made.&nbsp; Anybody who wants to attend the wedding should just 
join the wedding channel.&nbsp; Stop spamming up the public chat with crap 
people dont necessarily care about except who&#39;s involved.&nbsp; Also, the 
waterfall in Thurg is a bad choice of places.&nbsp; Granted it&#39;s beautiful to 
look at, but its a high traffic area.&nbsp; They should expect people to 
constantly be running through there.&nbsp; Especially for the reason you stated, 
training mobs to zone to escape.&nbsp; Everyone does it, nobody&#39;s innocent, it&#39;s 
part of the game.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Personally, I wouldn&#39;t think too much of it because 
there&#39;s nothing they can really do to you to get revenge.&nbsp; And if they do 
want revenge then they have serious issues cause it&#39;s JUST A GAME!&nbsp;

  <div><br></div><tt>I was in GD today and was slicing through wurms with my 
  trusty <br>necromantic pet when 2 more wurms jumped me and i had to run.&nbsp; 
  The <br>closest zone was thurgadin and i had to pray to cazic-thule that the 
  <br>coldain didn&#39;t hate Iksar Necromancers.<br>I had heard about a wedding 
  being held earlier and i remembered that <br>it was at the waterfall by 
  thurgadin so i shouted train to thurgadin <br>and remembered that i could FD 
  so i did to make sure that i wasn&#39;t <br>killed and that the wurms did&#39;t spoil 
  the wedding.&nbsp; Luckily i was far <br>enough from the wedding that the 
  wurms ran back to their caves.<br>Heres where it stars...&nbsp; First of all 
  the wedding was in OOC.&nbsp; Bad <br>choice.&nbsp; Second the peeps of the 
  wedding kept telling people in the <br>zone to &quot;Shutup&quot; or &quot;Stfu&quot;&nbsp; That 
  was being rude.&nbsp; I proceeded to tell <br>them that they should hold a 
  wedding in SAY or a seperate channel.&nbsp; <br>They all got pissed at me and 
  everyone there kept vowing revenge on <br>me.&nbsp; Made me a bit mad but i 
  held it in so that i didn&#39;t purposefully <br>give them a reason to get 
  mad.&nbsp; They continued to nag on and on so i <br>allerted my guild and they 
  all thought the same thing.&nbsp; A Wedding <br>should be held in private chat 
  and if others talk in the zone just <br>filter the ooc and shouts.&nbsp; The 
  wedding was very badly planned and <br>now i have a whole guild mad at 
  me.&nbsp; ( the other guild that was <br>having the marriage not mine)&nbsp; I 
  was wondering what you all think of <br>weddings in EQ and was i justified in 
  shouting train and telling them <br>that they should hold their wedding in 
  private if they don&#39;t want to <br>hear all the shouts and ooc&#39;s of a 
  zone.&nbsp; <br><br>Piezie V&#39;rix<br>47th Necromancer<br>Fennin
