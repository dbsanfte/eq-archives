<div id="ygrps-yiv-379084043">It&#39;s also the first spell of that type a wizard gets so it fizzles a LOT. My<br/>
wizard spent a good 3 hours medding and fizzling just trying to get her<br/>
familiar back. I&#39;ve never noticed any change in my fizzles or anything after<br/>
a successful summoning. And sometimes it runs off and I can&#39;t find it. But<br/>
it&#39;s fun to have it just following around and flapping it&#39;s little wings.<br/>
When I&#39;m bored I just talk to my familiar and emote I&#39;m feeding it cookies.<br/>
Too bad you can&#39;t name your familiars. I call mine Flappy.<br/>

Familiar is a wizard&#39;s pet. It can&#39;t fight, it&#39;s more like a visible  buff.<br/>
You have to resummon it each time you die, but it zones with you.<br/>

  Subject: [EverQuest] Pets vs. Familiars<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve noticed lately there are now &quot;Familiars&quot; that people have. How do<br/>
  these differ from Pets? Also when you die and have a &quot;familiar&quot; do you<br/>
  have to reconjure them up like you do a pet or do they come back when<br/>
  you do? And finally who all can have a &quot;familiar&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!<br/>
