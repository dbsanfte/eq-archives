<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849949109"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yeah, found out about that a few days after Luclin<br/>
&gt; came out, still haven&#39;t gone up there to try it out...<br/>
&gt; Got a strong aversion to Luclin mostly due to how<br/>
&gt; poorly it ran when I went up there the first few<br/>
&gt; times. ;) (also I tend to be a creature of habit,<br/>
&gt; sticking to zones I know :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For the record, does Luclin run slow for everyone? The only time I ever go<br/>
up there is to get spells for my Druid because of the major lag I have had<br/>
there ever since it came out. It takes me twice as long to zone there than<br/>
it does anywhere else in the game.<br/>
