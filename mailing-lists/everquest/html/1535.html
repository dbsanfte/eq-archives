<div id="ygrps-yiv-843289519">I had someone come up to me and start begging me to summon cold stones for<br/>
them. They started shouting &quot;would someone summon me a cold stone&quot;. After<br/>
about 10 minutes I shouted back &quot;NO.&quot;<br/>
The person sent me a tell and said &quot;why not?&quot; I said it was bc #1 I didn&#39;t<br/>
even know what cold stones were and #2 I didn&#39;t have a spell to summon them.<br/>
When they asked me to buy the spell I told them that my class didn&#39;t get<br/>
that spell.<br/>
Some people..<br/>
luv,<br/>
