<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284989504">I believe the event is triggered by a quest and can repeat istelf. I just<br/>
haven&#39;t figured out what needs to be done to trigger it yet.<br/>

absence...  A bunch of my guild members went to QH Where there was some<br/>
event going on.  Guess there was a server (or system) wide message for the<br/>
event.   A 42 Ench Friend of mine was there,  & he said that many of the<br/>
mobs were red to him.  Unfortunately by the time I got back from the TV<br/>
show,  the event was over =(<br/>

&gt; Only 2 places like that are Vox&#39;s lair (only inside it where she is, NOT<br/>
&gt; the rest of the zone) and Naggy&#39;s lair (same thing). Any OTHER part of the<br/>
&gt; zone is 100% normal for all levels, and can be gone into. As for exp...try<br/>
&gt; Karnor&#39;s and  OS. Jaggedpine might be a good bet too.<br/>

&gt;   Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place to hunt<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>
&gt;   Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>other<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there..<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt;   hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to<br/>
&gt; zone<br/>
&gt;   beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the<br/>
&gt; higher<br/>
&gt;   lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>
&gt;   Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;   luv,<br/>
