<div id="ygrps-yiv-533510406">you need to fiddle around with the user interface some to understand how it<br/>
works. Most things are reachable through /commands in the chat bar. try<br/>
/help and read some.<br/>
<br/>
You also have a hot key bank, you need to assign skills to buttons and<br/>
probably you will want put the button in your hot-key bank. try to structure<br/>
it early into types of banks. Combat, traveling and so on. find a system<br/>
that suits you. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to delve into the more advanced commands then maybe perhaps<br/>
affix sense heading to your slam button or something like that. This will<br/>
max out Sense heading very fast. Or filter out your hits out of the chatbox,<br/>
this gets annoying fast when you got double attack and dual wield. hard to<br/>
read things then.<br/>
<br/>
There are many many things that makes the ui better, there is no set way of<br/>
whats good and bad just preference. IT also varies as yo pass through<br/>
levels. <br/>
<br/>
If you like to raid a lot and are playing in large groups, remember<br/>
serverfilter is your friend and DONT forget to set your datarate.txt to<br/>
appropriate value. Your friends will love it even more than you not having<br/>
to wait for ld people all the time. <br/>
<br/>
But I think you have some learning to do before this, keep it up.<br/>
Experiment, learn. dont just take it from everyone else.<br/>

Speak yout of person? how do you Add to ones friends list? And, How <br/>
do you learn things like sence heading? I have alot of other <br/>
