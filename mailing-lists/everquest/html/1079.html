<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269953578">Hrm...just explore...see if there is an area you might enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
First just throw everything into the bank.  And have fun...<br/>
<br/>
My Wood Elf has been from Greater Faydark to Kaladim to Ocean of Tears<br/>
(never did get off the boat) to Freeport to North Ro to E/W Commons to<br/>
Rivervale to well...too many more to remember.<br/>
<br/>
My only suggestion....when getting a port from a wizard...don&#39;t.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
stories of people who didn&#39;t know how to play (how can people who get up<br/>
there in levels not know how to play?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know but some level 53 wizzie in Commons took me to<br/>
Dreadlands....then to Cazic Thule (where he proptly died after being mauled<br/>
by lizards.<br/>
I died 10 seconds after my invis wore off.  Thank God that Dernak a level 53<br/>
(why&#39;s everyone but me a 53) Enchanger had a good group going and they<br/>
popped me over and we picked it up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Go places...have fun...<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is it better to build more than one character at a time? Mine is only <br/>
&gt; a level 6 halfling warrior, but I have invested quite a bit of time <br/>
&gt; in just getting this far. I know I can build another character a bit <br/>
&gt; faster based on what I have learned, but is that investment of time <br/>
&gt; worthwhile?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do have a second character just started, but that was only <br/>
&gt; something to play when the area my halfling was camped in was shut <br/>
&gt; down for repairs. I am thinking more on building a second character <br/>
&gt; for tactical purposes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For example, I wandered out of Rivervale to High Hold Pass one day, <br/>
&gt; and was slaughtered by Orcs. I managed to sneak back to recover my <br/>
&gt; stuff, but could not get out fast enough. I gave up that corpse, and <br/>
&gt; concentrated on building in Misty Thicket.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My thought is to build a character over time just to get through High <br/>
&gt; Pass Hold. My greater interest is in the warrior working his way <br/>
&gt; across Misty Thicket. Am I wasting valuable game time on this second <br/>
&gt; character? High Pass Hold seems extremely difficult, and might not be <br/>
&gt; worth the effort until much later in the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any thoughts?<br/>
