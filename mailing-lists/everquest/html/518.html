<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841831633">The portal itself doesn&#39;t seem functional as of yet.. but its in the center<br/>
of a room, its a round structure with one entrance.  You can step inside,<br/>
but as soon as you step into the center you are transported back to its<br/>
entrance.  I don&#39;t know what the portal to the plane of hate looks like, I<br/>
can only describe this one. <br/>

I have yet to see this area, but since you describe it as a shrine it may be<br/>
one of the portals to the planes.  Possibly.  Though is sounds a tad weakly<br/>
guarded to be a portal ( the portal for the plane of hate is guarded by 6<br/>
Spectres and a level 41ish Necro ).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>
