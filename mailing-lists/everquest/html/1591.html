<div id="ygrps-yiv-235791000">I dont disagree they shouldnt replace items that are lost to theft.  But to<br/>
me the point is you wont even get your character back.  Account locked out<br/>
no questions asked.  I would suggest you dont even need to have your account<br/>
&quot;hacked&quot; anymore to get your account banned.  All someone has to do is find<br/>
out your account login call verant claim its his and bother them enough<br/>
about getting it back and I bet you a dollar to a donut (figure I would<br/>
throw in an old saying while someone else was, lol) that your account would<br/>
be locked out.  Think about it.<br/>

Yes.. to both of your statements.. If that was the<br/>
case, mind you that&#39;s such a far fetched example of<br/>
someone hacking your system for the mere purpose of<br/>
stealing your everquest account.  It&#39;s still under the<br/>
responsibility of the player.  How could you ever<br/>
prove to Verant that your account was hacked in such<br/>
fashion?  I guess they should just recreate objects<br/>
that you have deleted accidentally too.  They are<br/>
responsible for the program and its integrity itself<br/>
not for the inability for its users to properly defend<br/>
themselves.  They&#39;ve implemented a lot of changes to<br/>
help protect the player from themselves =) and the<br/>
community of EQ players at large are happy.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t worry about that new statement, GMs can do<br/>
whatever they want, its simply path the company would<br/>
like to follow for a majority.  <br/>
<br/>
Personal responsibility sucks sure.. btw.. My free<br/>
lunch has arrived...=).<br/>
