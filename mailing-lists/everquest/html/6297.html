<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I saw a systemwide message ing ame today that said 
the beta was now open.&nbsp; the registration for it only lasted for about 15 
minutes though so you had to register in that time.&nbsp; I imagine they will 
announce open testing registration periodically as the time draws near for its 
live release.&nbsp; I did get registered and spent a pretty good hour plus 
downloading the beta files.&nbsp; I have yet to play it, but I copied the email 
I received so people can see what it says.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Welcome to the 
EverQuest(R) Depths of Darkhollow(TM) (DoD) beta!&nbsp; Please read this entire 
email carefully. It contains all the information you will need to hit the ground 
running and make the most of your time in beta. Remember, you accepted the 
EverQuest Terms of Use, License and Non-Disclosure Agreement as a condition for 
acceptance into the beta program, and everything included here as well as what 
you see on the beta server, in beta-related communications and beta forums and 
message boards are covered by that agreement. <br><br><br>HOW DO I GET ON THE 
BETA SERVER?<br><br>In order to access the Depths of Darkhollow beta server, you 
will need to download the Beta patcher. The FTP site for downloading the patcher 
is listed below. There may be a lot of data to download, so please be 
patient.&nbsp; You should run this patcher before you log in, every time.&nbsp; 
Failing to do so may cause you to experience crashes or gameplay issues that 
could be fixed just by patching.</font><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">You may 
download the Depths of Darkhollow beta patcher at the following FTP 
site</font></font></font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">FTP Site 
omitted due to NDA.</font></font></div>
<div><br><br><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To get to the ftp 
site:<br><br>Enter the ftp address into your Internet Explorer web 
browser.&nbsp; It will bring you to the ftp site. The file you need is called 
EQBetaPatcher.zip.&nbsp; Just right click on the file and copy it to your 
desktop.&nbsp; Unzip the file and copy betaeverquest.exe into your root 
EverQuest directory (Should be in C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Sony&#92;EverQuest unless you 
changed your default installation.)<br><br>Run this every time prior to logging 
in to the beta server. You will see the Beta Server on the server list, choose 
that server and log in.<br><br><br>HOW LONG IS BETA?<br><br>The beta test is 
scheduled to begin on July 20th, 2005 and is scheduled to end on September 13th, 
2005, unless we decide to change these dates.<br><br><br>HOW DO I GET TO THE DoD 
ZONES?<br><br>When you get onto the beta server, create your character and head 
to the Plane of Knowledge. Find Old Man Thorren and he can teleport you to 
Corathus Creep.<br><br><br>HOW DO I COPY MY CHARACTER ONTO BETA?<br><br>For us 
to copy your favorite EverQuest character to the beta server, please indicate 
which character you want us to copy by logging into your play server as your 
favorite character. You indicate that you want us to copy an individual 
character by typing the command /beta in your chat window. Periodically we will 
run scripts that will copy characters to the beta server. Keep in mind that we 
will be running the character copies on an as-needed basis - not necessarily at 
regular intervals. It may take several days for us to copy your 
character.<br><br><br>THE /betabuff COMMAND<br><br>The level range needed to 
test all of the variations of dungeons for&nbsp; DoD is huge.&nbsp; In order to 
give you that ability to test as much of the expansion as possible, we have 
created a /betabuff command.&nbsp; Here&#39;s how you use it.<br><br>1. Create a 
first level character on the beta server and log in with that character (this 
command will only work on 1st level characters).<br><br>2. Type /betabuff CLASS 
LEVEL - where CLASS is the class of the character you would like to create, and 
LEVEL is the level that you want that character to be.&nbsp; LEVEL can only be 
numbers divisible by 5, starting at 20.&nbsp; So 20, 25, 30, etc.<br><br>That&#39;s 
it.&nbsp; The character you created will be transformed into a character of the 
level and class you have chosen.&nbsp; Your race and even gender may change as 
well.<br><br><br>BETA FEEDBACK<br><br>There are two methods for passing 
information to us about what you experience during the beta.<br><br>/bug should 
be used to report bugs.&nbsp; Bugs are gameplay features that do not work, 
spelling errors, and anything that just does not work as intended.&nbsp; Please 
give us as much detail about the bug as you can think of when reporting 
it.<br><br>/feedback should be used to send in comments about parts of the 
expansion that work properly, but that you would like to see changed.&nbsp; If 
you discover an item that you think should have less Wis and more Int, then use 
/feedback.&nbsp; If you think a certain encounter is too easy or too hard, use 
/feedback to report it.<br><br>It is important that you distinguish between 
these two options, as one is read primarily by our testing team and the other is 
read mostly by our game designers.&nbsp; Sending a bug through /feedback can 
delay our ability to fix it, since we&#39;ll have to route that to our testers for 
verification.<br><br>Please use this command to explore as many of the 
adventures as you can and report your findings to us.<br><br>If you find 
yourself in dire need of assistance, you can use /petition to contact us for 
help.&nbsp; Please only petition if the situation is one that you can&#39;t correct 
yourself.&nbsp; For example, if you used /betabuff to create a character and you 
have lost the corpse, there is no need to /petition.&nbsp; You can just log out, 
create a new character and use the /betabuff command again.<br><br>Please 
remember that your participation in the beta program is subject to the Terms of 
Use, License and Non-Disclosure Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) which you have already 
agreed to. Your access in and to the beta program, including the patcher, is for 
your personal, non-commercial use only, in accordance with the Agreement, and 
any feedback you provide is confidential.<br><br>Thank you for your time and 
effort; we appreciate your help testing this 
expansion.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br><br>The EverQuest Depths of Darkhollow 
Development Team</font><br></div>
