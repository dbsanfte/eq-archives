see with being charged to train is that you end up with a lot of&nbsp; excess 
training points you can&#39;t use.&nbsp; You get 5 training points each level you go 
up.&nbsp; However, you don&#39;t necessarily get 5 new skills each level so if 
you&#39;re like me, you put one point into the new skill to get it started then let 
the course of the game and use of that skill cause it to go up.&nbsp; Of course 
after a certain point you get charged plat for training, not to mention the 
training point.&nbsp; Well I don&#39;t need the training points but I can&#39;t spend 
them on anything else.&nbsp; So I find it&#39;s a waste of plat to have to pay for 
training.&nbsp;&nbsp; But what can ya do?&nbsp; They should have some kind of 
reward process implemented where you can convert your non-used training points 
into AA points or back into plat.</font></div>

AM<br>Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Training Points and 
Platinum<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, You can train your trade skills 
( baking, Tailoring, ect) To <br>21 and after a few free points it does start 
charging. Languages and <br>other skills like 1 hb 2 hb and slashing can be 
trained way on past <br>21 at your trainer depending on your level.&nbsp; My 
druid has always used <br>a 1hb When I decided to het a scimitar at lv 48 I 
trained as high as <br>I could and it was costing several plat a point&nbsp; I 
paid over a <br>hundred to gain skill level at trainer.&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been on almost 4 years and it has been this way 
the entire <br>time I have&nbsp; played. I beleive the reason trade skills are 
capped at <br>21 is to create player based economy for and to reward those 
willing <br>to go out and put the work in 
something.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
