<div id="ygrps-yiv-872800078">Hey Barto, how did you map the sense heading to  your right turn key?  and<br/>
does this free up hotkey space for other things?  Reason I ask this is I was<br/>
taught by a friend to have the Hotkey for sense heading to be in the  first<br/>
space next to  my combat key like taunt or kick or bash depending on  my<br/>
character that way I can increase sense heading skill while in combat.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; What my son and I did was to map the hot key to the right turn<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; button. Every time we turn right, we sense heading. Builds skill<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly. Can be done for foraging, as well, but you end up with<br/>
&gt; stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on your cursor as you run around. Not always a good thing.<br/>
