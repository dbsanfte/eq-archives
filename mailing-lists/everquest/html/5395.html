<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-846559150">I&#39;ve had people tell me there are better items out there with less effort,<br/>
but it feels good to accomplish something like this. :-)<br/>
I&#39;d heard they originally planned to have more than 8 shawls but I haven&#39;t<br/>
heard of any quests to get more shawls after the 8th. I think I read that<br/>
they planned to do 11 shawl quests or something. I&#39;d be happy with 8 or 10.<br/>
I like even numbers. :-D But I hope they don&#39;t make the skill needed to do<br/>
the shawl so ungodly high. I wish there were more quests for tradeskills<br/>
that were doable at 101 to 120 range in skill.<br/>
The 4th.. is that the one with the triggers that might spawn the deathsquad?<br/>
or is that the one that needs snow griffin eggs?<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; shawl on two of my toons... I get impatient, lol. But<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to try and give it another shot.<br/>

&gt; WOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; After a long long long time of working on my skills,<br/>
&gt; &gt; farming the items, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; spending almost all of my money... I finally did it!<br/>
&gt; &gt; I failed a combine a couple times and lost two runed<br/>
&gt; &gt; sea shells (which were<br/>
&gt; &gt; the most expensive thing I had to buy for it-- I<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried hunting in SG but<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t have any luck). I got my JC to 173, my<br/>
&gt; &gt; tailoring to 176, fletching to<br/>
&gt; &gt; 180, brewing to 184, pottery to 154, and smithing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; 112. I got impatient on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the pottery and just asked someone to put the water<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the velium powder<br/>
&gt; &gt; (made from the runed sea shell and a small brick of<br/>
&gt; &gt; velium in a mortar and<br/>
&gt; &gt; pestle-- no fail combine) in a pottery wheel and got<br/>
&gt; &gt; my Unfired Rune. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; fired the rune. I bought a geerlok gemsetter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Borrowed a geerlok planing<br/>
&gt; &gt; tool for my fletching for the combines. and borrowed<br/>
&gt; &gt; a geerlok sewing kit<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the final combine. Had C3 on and success!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; I now have my Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now I need to work on JC and Smithing some more for<br/>
&gt; &gt; my 8th shawl...<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
