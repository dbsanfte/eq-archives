<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035510577">LOL!  OH!  For a minute there  you had me scared!  I in NO way<br/>
intended to imply favoritism (though one of my friends claims I was<br/>
just &quot;smiled upon by the Gods&quot; and my husband was not &lt;G&gt;).  However,<br/>
as you mentioned, I wouldn&#39;t put it completely past them.  I have even<br/>
heard rumor (strictly hearsay) that Verant at first  had no intention<br/>
of having the armor &quot;show&quot; on female characters....  So the guys down<br/>
in the design and programming department may have a<br/>
few...preferences...they&#39;re entertaining. &lt;bg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But...Now that you mention it, I may have to create two new<br/>
male/female characters with identical stats just to see what<br/>
happens... :)<br/>

&gt;i think the biggest point here is that as far as she can tell, the<br/>
&gt;characters are matched except for gender.  wouldn&#39;t it be one sick joke if<br/>
&gt;Verant had been nerfing the genders differently all along so that the female<br/>
&gt;is easier to play than her male equivalent?  this would definitely<br/>
&gt;demonstrate an evil intent by Verant to undermind the family unit and i<br/>
&gt;would have to report them to the appropriate conservative left wing<br/>
&gt;factions....just kidding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;really wouldn&#39;t put it past them though...seriously </span></blockquote></div>
