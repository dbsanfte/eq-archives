G-Fay.&nbsp; That&#39;s where I got both of mine.&nbsp; There is a bandit camp in 
G-Fay and I killed exactly two bandits and got the golden bandit tooth.&nbsp; So 
now it&#39;s down to the Orc Fibulas.&nbsp; I need 2 of them.&nbsp; One of the 
legplates, one for the tunic.&nbsp; From what I hear these drop off Orc Slavers 
in the cave in Crushbone.&nbsp; My ranger is level 10 and I&#39;ve had no trouble 
acquiring any of these items.&nbsp; The Orc Slavers con yellow to me at 
10.&nbsp; I can kill them with help.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt><br><br>This is great info! Wish I had it when I started! 
  Anyway for those newbs<br>that are going to start this right now the Orc 
  Fibula is the hard item<br>to get. However if you come across these grab a few 
  of them! I know you<br>need at least three that I can remember. The bandit&#39;s 
  tooth can be<br>bought in Kelethin, unfortunately I don&#39;t remember which 
  vendor has it.<br>Also if you hang around spires you may be able to pick one 
  up after a<br>higher lvl player knocks off a bandit. That&#39;s how I got mine. 
  The<br>fingerbones I&#39;ve found to be relatively common even at Orc hill. 
  The<br>onluy thing is I think it actually depends on the lvl character 
  going<br>for the items. I may be wrong on this but it&#39;s just a guess!

  &lt;wulftech@...&gt;<br>Subject: Trueshot Chainmail Ranger Quest 
  armor<br><br>The Trueshot Chainmail armor is a newbie armor quest in Greater 
  Faydark.<br>You can find all this information on Allakhazam and EQrangers, but 
  I<br>offer it here to you just for comprehensive purposes.&nbsp; This armor 
  is<br>wearable by half elves and wood elves, but only if your deity is 
  Tunare.<br>The quest starts out in the ranger guild in Kelethin.&nbsp; Hail 
  Samatansyn<br>Flamecaller to start the quest.&nbsp; He will give you a 
  Trueshot Armor kit<br>which you will use to put specific items in and combine 
  them to make the<br>mold for the armor.&nbsp; Then take the pattern he gives 
  you for the armor<br>piece you wish to create and combine it with the mold you 
  made in a<br>forge.&nbsp; My ranger is level 10 and has not failed on a single 
  piece yet.<br>I just helped a level 1 ranger craft the coif and he succeeded 
  so I<br>don&#39;t believe it takes any smithing skill to finish each item.&nbsp; 
  <br><br>NOTE: Most of the items can be purchased from vendors around Kelethin 
  so<br>before you spend time killing mobs, try buying them first, unless 
  you<br>just want the xp.&nbsp; Some of the orc specific items are No Drop, 
  which<br>I&#39;ll indicate by (ND).&nbsp; The bricks of crude bronze are best 
  purchased<br>off other players, or as I found out you can trade Crushbone 
  belts for<br>them.&nbsp; <br><br><br>BOOTS:&nbsp;&nbsp; (all items 
  purchasable)<br>- 3 bricks crude bronze<br>- 1 severed orc foot<br>- 2 spider 
  legs<br><br>BRACER:&nbsp; (all items purchasable)<br>- 1 brick crude 
  bronze<br>- 1 skeleton tibia<br>- 1 pixie wing<br>- 1 gypsy 
  wine<br><br>COIF:&nbsp; (all items purchasable)<br>- 2 bricks crude 
  bronze<br>- 1 Royal Jelly&nbsp;&nbsp; (drops off giant wasps)<br>- 1 
  spiderling eye<br>- 1 ration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (NOT Iron 
  Ration)<br><br>GAUNTLETS:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>- 3 bricks crude bronze<br>- 1 Orc 
  Ulna (ND)<br>- 1 Orc Tibia (ND)<br>- 2 Orc Fingerbones (ND&nbsp; Note: These 
  are rare drops)<br><br>LEGPLATES:<br>- 4 bricks crude bronze<br>- 1 Orc 
  Fibula&nbsp; (ND&nbsp; Note: Very rare drop.&nbsp; Drops off Orc Slavers)<br>- 
  1 Orc Clavicle (ND)<br>- 1 Lightstone <br><br>SLEEVES:&nbsp;&nbsp; (all items 
  purchasable except venom sacks)<br>- 2 bricks crude bronze<br>- 2 giant wasp 
  venom sacks<br>- 1 large window abdomen&nbsp; (ND)<br>- 1 white 
  wine<br><br>TUNIC:<br>- 5 bricks crude bronze<br>- 1 Orc fibula (ND very 
  rare)<br>- 1 golden bandit tooth&nbsp;&nbsp; (note: not sure where to obtain 
  this or what<br>it drops from, but I suspect the bandits in NK probably)<br>- 
  1 pristine forest drakeling scale&nbsp; (note: should be purchasable but 
  I<br>haven&#39;t seen one yet)<br>- 1 Orc Ribcage (ND)<br>- 1 Orc Eye (common 
  drop, can also purchase)<br><br><br><br>I suggest doing the gaunts, the legs, 
  and the tunic last since the<br>fibulas will come the hardest.&nbsp; This 
  armor has decent stats and should<br>be good up until mid 20&#39;s.&nbsp; You will 
  have to go to Crushbone for the ND<br>items, but other than that, it&#39;s a 
  simple quest. You can check out the<br>stats on Allakhazam.&nbsp; It&#39;s nice 
  looking armor too.<br><br>Enjoy!!<br><br>Airbourne Ranger<br>Lvl 10 ELF
