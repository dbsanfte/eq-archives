i&#39;ll have my puter back soon and a copy of SoL should<br/>
run fine on it, but I know there&#39;s a rather<br/>
significant chunk of their customer base (and a loyal<br/>
group at that) who&#39;s really getting left behind. It<br/>
really wouldn&#39;t have killed them to come up with a low<br/>
res Vah Shir model and make that an option purely for<br/>
non-expansion viewing. This reminds me way too much of<br/>
what Origin did with it&#39;s Ultima/Wing Commander/etc.<br/>
games, and i&#39;m sure half the mailing list is saying<br/>
&quot;Origin who?&quot;. ;)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Old puters work just fine. The only problem you have<br/>
&gt;is that your video card *MUST* be dx8 certified.<br/>
&gt;Other than that even going as low as 128 megs will<br/>
&gt;work. There is not the slightest chance in hell you<br/>
&gt;can install luclin on that machine tho, cause it will<br/>
&gt;die while trying to render the new graphics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t gone over the list, but how many low end<br/>
(8mb) video cards are dx8 certified? Keeping in mind<br/>
that there&#39;s a lot of video card manufacturers who<br/>
either got out of that aspect of the business or flat<br/>
out went under, so recent drivers are also a problem.<br/>
I know Verant can&#39;t cater exclusively to the low end<br/>
user, I suppose you could argue they&#39;ve done that by<br/>
not making drastic changes in Kunark and Velious.<br/>
Perhaps in six months once Verant has hammered out a<br/>
few more of the hardware issues with patches, this<br/>
won&#39;t be as drastic a problem. Although I still hate<br/>
this mentality of &quot;we have to release software that&#39;s<br/>
not ready to make the xmas sales rush, we&#39;ll patch it<br/>
to death til it actually works once it&#39;s been<br/>
released&quot;. Software that doesn&#39;t work properly on AMD<br/>
processors is *NOT* market ready yet. :) (what&#39;s AMD&#39;s<br/>
market share up to these days? I believe last number I<br/>
heard thrown around was 30%)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And you should really get more ram, it isnt that<br/>
&gt;expensive. Ram and a nice video card and everything<br/>
&gt;works a lot smoother. CPU power isnt that important.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the best investment one can make at this point<br/>
for the price involved, but for a lot of people simply<br/>
keeping up with Verant&#39;s $10 a month (read: high<br/>
school/particularly broke college students) and their<br/>
broadband fees is expensive enough. In a perfect world<br/>
everyone would be running 1ghz+ Athlons with a gig of<br/>
RAM, 40gb of HD space, and new GeForce3 cards, but the<br/>
reality is that for every one customer running a<br/>
machine like that, i&#39;d wager they have five running<br/>
the bare min reqs. (or in some cases &lt;gasp!&gt; even<br/>
below ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And dont be so negative, SoL is a whopping expansion<br/>
&gt;worth the new specs. Graphics are cool (some char<br/>
&gt;models are a bit weird) but mobs/surrondings<br/>
&gt;are very nice. The mob features are a LOT improved<br/>
&gt;adding more tactics to fights. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From what little i&#39;ve heard being unable to actually<br/>
play for the last week, it&#39;s a great expansion. :P The<br/>
general consensus among players I talked to during my<br/>
week long pre-SoL binge though was that the game<br/>
wasn&#39;t really in need of a major earthshattering<br/>
expansion. There&#39;s TONS of worldspace that the<br/>
majority of us haven&#39;t explored already, plenty of<br/>
cool items and armor to acquire, the alternate<br/>
advancement is interesting but doesn&#39;t effect most<br/>
people, etc. I&#39;d go so far as to wager only a tiny<br/>
handful (if any) of people have explored every nook<br/>
and cranny of Kunark and Velious. mmmmmm... Who knows,<br/>
maybe if it wasn&#39;t for DAoC Shadows wouldn&#39;t have been<br/>
released for another year. ;) (whole other debate<br/>
there though...)<br/>
