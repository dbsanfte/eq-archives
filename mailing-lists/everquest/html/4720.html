<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808198848">Wanting to meet new poeple and make some new friends.  I would like <br/>
to propose a game night on either Wens, or Thurs nights 6p to 9p <br/>
eastern time.  We all start new toons and only play them once a week <br/>
on game night unless you miss a night and need to make up lvs. <br/>
   Any server or server type is good to me PVP, PVE, or blue , Even <br/>
blue and we follow discord.  We could all play one type of toon <br/>
(beastlords or mages) or shoot for balnce or all iskar some thing <br/>
like that.   Please post if you would be interested in joing we will <br/>
all be making new toons thatway we are all equal and broke.<br/>
                        Thnx Hogg</div>
