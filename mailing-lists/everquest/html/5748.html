<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322866015">Quick answer, no I have not seen it.  Most of this info can be found on web,<br/>
they just lump it one place.<br/>
<br/>
Item locations and quests can be found at www.everquest.allakhazam.com<br/>
<br/>
Trade skill info is all at www.eqtraders.com<br/>
<br/>
Maps can be found at www.eqatlas.com<br/>

Using Kazaa Lite (not plain Kazaa, it will jack up your PC) I found a ton of<br/>
EQ cheat, hack plat-making, etc guides.  I downloaded some and if they don&#39;t<br/>
involve anything illegal I would be willing to post them to the files<br/>
section of the group for those that don&#39;t want to mess with file-sharing<br/>
programs.<br/>
<br/>
For $5 less then the guide you can buy 10,000 plat if that is what you want.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful with power-leveling.  It is a great way to make a high-leveled<br/>
character that is pretty useless.  In some games it works great since the<br/>
only way to increase skills is to gain a level.  When people come to EQ they<br/>
do it and end with with a level 30 char with no skills.  You get 5 points<br/>
for leveling, I normally get 100 - 150 skill points while gaining my level.<br/>
How are you going to make up for all those lost points?  You do boring stuff<br/>
over and over and over, that&#39;s how.  When I get to level 30 I won&#39;t need to<br/>
spend hours working my safe fall, bind wounds, or dodge, I use them all the<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I am also concerned about the PDFs.  How often are they updated?  I have<br/>
several of the published EQ guides I have gotten from book store discount<br/>
racks and much of the stuff in them is flat out wrong.  The game is always<br/>
changing and the websites change with it, my books do not.  Do these guides<br/>
get updated with every patch?</div>
