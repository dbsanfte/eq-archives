<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646371742">I have cheapies for every caster and hybrid alt I play any reasonable<br/>
amount, down to a 28 beastie who gets 3 hours every 6 months or so and a<br/>
month old 15 SK with about 8 hours played. Put simply, I think they&#39;re<br/>
absolutely priceless, tactically. I originally just had one for my druid to<br/>
make changing spells and medding while PLing easier, but I decided to try<br/>
one on my ranger to see how it went and I&#39;ve stayed with it from there. I&#39;m<br/>
pretty evenly split bt droggies and horses, and which sort for which style,<br/>
medding only or meleeing as well. I generally choose based on looks, and can<br/>
melee just as well from either when needed. I think it speeds things up<br/>
immeasurably, especially when there&#39;s no mind buffage to be had, and I can&#39;t<br/>
even begin to count how many times I lived bc I could use the horse to<br/>
switch spells while being hit, or to avoid being hit in the first place from<br/>
sit aggro.<br/>
<br/>
In short...it&#39;s worth it.<br/>

&gt; When I still played, I had a cheap horse for my cleric.  They are good<br/>
&gt; for &quot;medding while standing&quot; so you can get that heal off quicker.  But<br/>
&gt; I rarely rode the horse.  I just sat on it while fighting.  If we moved<br/>
&gt; our camp spot, I got off the horse, because SoW and SoE were faster.<br/>

&gt; &gt;They look fun to ride on, but i don&#39;t think they are worth it because<br/>
&gt; &gt;on my friend&#39;s account he has a cheap drog and then i found out the<br/>
&gt; &gt;cheap ones are slow =P lol. Are the horses the same? All the things<br/>
&gt; &gt;the cheap ones do is make you look rich.<br/>
