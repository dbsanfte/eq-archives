<div id="ygrps-yiv-806009880"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Thought I would move the discussion to a new thread.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I considered it myself... :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I like to sow and buff freely because I think it<br/>
&gt;builds good will in the game. I am convinced that<br/>
&gt;such good will comes back. A gift, a hand, good<br/>
&gt;advice. I cannot always afford to cross zones to do<br/>
&gt;so, but when I can I like to sow and buff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that sums up what i&#39;ve been referring to as<br/>
&quot;adding to the good karma pool&quot;, every time I SoW<br/>
someone and brighten their day, when they&#39;re playing<br/>
their alt Druid or Shaman, they&#39;re just a little more<br/>
likely to do the same for me. As for the last line<br/>
though, that&#39;s where I draw a personal line. You want<br/>
SoW, sure thing, absolutely happy to help, but you<br/>
come to me. Sometimes people decide it&#39;s not worth it<br/>
in large zones like LOIO, others they don&#39;t mind, but<br/>
most of the time either way people understand. :)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I like to do though is randomly hunt<br/>
people down and SoW them without any warning, then run<br/>
off before they can figure out where I am. ;) You know<br/>
you&#39;re running thru LOIO on your way to FV or<br/>
something and you see a guy in combat, swing near him<br/>
and SoW &#39;em, never once had a complaint and<br/>
accidentally saved a few lives that way. :) It&#39;s the<br/>
same deal in less combat intensive zones, running thru<br/>
GFay when you blow past that guy on the path cause<br/>
he&#39;s running normal speed, give him a boost. I know<br/>
what a boring run that is at normal from my rogue. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now that I can port, I have decided to do so without<br/>
&gt;thought of reward. Oh, of course I will go quite a<br/>
&gt;bit out of my way for an offer of good money, but I<br/>
&gt;have found giving a port to someone unable to give<br/>
&gt;much in return seems to add to the game in other ways<br/>
&gt;than money. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m still pondering exactly how I feel about group<br/>
ports. I don&#39;t think I could ever feel right about<br/>
running around auctioning &quot;Porting to NK, BB, SF, Tox<br/>
and WC for 50pp per seat&quot;, but I do personally think<br/>
that a small donation is the right thing when<br/>
recieving a port. (not that i&#39;d ever actively demand<br/>
one) As someone who&#39;s probably spent a couple hundred<br/>
plat on ports over the last while, I just see the<br/>
standard 10pp donation is a small way of saying<br/>
&quot;thanks for your time&quot;. Again, not required, but a<br/>
nice gesture. It&#39;s most certainly a larger commitment<br/>
than SoW... (I still can&#39;t feel right about taking<br/>
donations for a SoW though, the guy with the HQ Bear<br/>
Pelt was rather persistant, but I usually stubbornly<br/>
refuse &#39;em :)<br/>
