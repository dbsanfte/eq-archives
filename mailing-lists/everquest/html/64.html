<div id="ygrps-yiv-602581124">I haven&#39;t gotten much mail from this list other than messages about not being able to get on it. But anyway, thought I&#39;d toss a question out. Has anyone completed the donation collections for the temple of thunder in qeynos? I&#39;ve managed a few but not the requested six. If anyone has and can give me some pointers or hints in the right direction it&#39;d be appreciated. And you should prolly mail it to me direct so as not to cause spoilers. <br/>
Been stuck on most of my quests lately either due to difficulty or just not being able to find an answer. Not to mention all those ones in the aquaducts. Rat king? Where....<br/>
