<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947344770">If it&#39;s not letting you use your newbie weapon I don&#39;t think it&#39;s from lack<br/>
of training. It might be a bug. You should bug report it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Training points? That implies training which I didn&#39;t get. I&#39;ll back<br/>
&gt; track and see what I missed. My newbe weapon is a club. I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been able to use it because it won&#39;t equip. Maybe that&#39;s because I<br/>
&gt; need hand-to-hand training to use it. I&#39;ll check that out. Thanks.<br/>
