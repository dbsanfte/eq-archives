that you<br>
&gt;can be summoned back to your corpse so you don&#39;t have to make the<br>
trek to<br>
&gt;wherever you died all over again. But yeah, if you can&#39;t find your<br>
corpse<br>
&gt;it&#39;s a royal pain.<br>
&gt;Would you have it so you have all your gear but can still be rezzed? or<br>
&gt;would you just eliminate rezzes?<br>

<br>
Su I think rezzes would still be good... maybe do less exp loss if you&#39;re rezzed but still have all your gear. Or lose a percentage of cash on hand if you aren&#39;t rezzed... something to make rezzing still worthwhile but less of a hassle if you can&#39;t get it done.<br>
<br>
I like the NPC idea too... that would be great b/c then you wouldn&#39;t have to go back somewhere dangerous (and without all the gear to help protect you!) to get your body back. <br>
<br>
I have to say though... I am grateful that you don&#39;t lose all your spells too when you die... it would suck to have to buy all of them back again!<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Sail to your heart&#39;s desires, and know when to drop anchor.&quot;</span></blockquote></font></font></html>
