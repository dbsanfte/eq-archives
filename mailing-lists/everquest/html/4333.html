<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022435590">&quot;Expect the servers to be very unstable for at least a day, sometimes takes <br/>
a week to get the servers to stay up more than a few hours after a launch <br/>
day...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That would explain why I was repeatedly disconnected last night. It was <br/>
getting extremely annoying. It didn&#39;t even occur to me that not only were <br/>
the servers unstable after the new expansion, but that there were probably a <br/>
million people playing with their new Froglok characters.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Frogloks, I have seen many that were already in their 20s, and <br/>
it was the first day. I can only imagine how long those people have been <br/>
playing yesterday... probably hours and hours on end. It&#39;s amazing that they <br/>
don&#39;t have anything to do on a Monday of all days.<br/>
<br/>
I do not have the expansion yet. I might have mentioned this, but I am <br/>
unfortunately using dial up, and the download would have taken more than 6 <br/>
hours. Therefore, I am waiting until the expansion hits stores in a week or <br/>
so and purchasing it that way. I can&#39;t wait to use the new features, such as <br/>
the map. That was an excellent idea and will definitely make traveling much <br/>
easier.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, does anyone know anything about the new creatures that you <br/>
may purchase for riding, such as a horse? Are they more expensive than <br/>
horses? I have wanted a horse for the longest time, but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s <br/>
tough to make money... especially being a caster. When grouped, the melee <br/>
types loot the corpses before I can get to them usually.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all from me for now. Take care everyone and enjoy the new expansion!<br/>
