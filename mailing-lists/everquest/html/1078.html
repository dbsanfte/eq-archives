<div id="ygrps-yiv-632708633">I&#39;d go with the short run kinda groups...<br/>
I mean at these low levels you don&#39;t know who is just playing the game on<br/>
weekends ...or who is too addicted to it...(me)<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I know that there is a tunnel on the other side of the wall in the<br/>
back somewhere that will take you to another area<br/>
can&#39;t remember if you fight kobolds or orcs in there.<br/>

I went into Misty with my level 14 Druid and nothing there is remotely<br/>
green...cept guards<br/>

&gt; Subject:	[EverQuest] Misty Thicket<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a level 6 halfling warrior, first character. I am currently <br/>
&gt; hunting just outside the gate of Misty Thicket. I can handle about <br/>
&gt; 30% of what I meet, and with care I have not been killed lately.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I cannot find my heading very well, so I am cautious going out too <br/>
&gt; far. At the gates are deputies to take care of the big stuff, so I <br/>
&gt; hunt nearby. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone know if there is a zone at the other side of Misty <br/>
&gt; Thicket?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How nasty do things get out there? I don&#39;t expect to take on giant <br/>
&gt; spiders too soon, but I don&#39;t want to play too timid, either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any advise?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can group with other newbies for short runs, but I don&#39;t have the <br/>
&gt; time to get a regular group together right now. Can these short term <br/>
&gt; groups be very useful, or is it better to concentrate on solo stat <br/>
&gt; building?<br/>
