  <div><br></div><tt>Ah. That&#39;s why you make friends. Group with some people. 
  Make sure to play<br>nice. Ask others for advice. Find some people you really 
  like hanging with<br>and put them on friends list. Then if you see them on 
  contact them. Find out<br>if you can hang out with people who seem to get 
  along with you really well.<br>No stalking though. :-)<br>I have friends that 
  I met in the game who like to group with me or help me<br>out. I help them 
  out. A guild is a wonderful thing as well. My guildies and<br>I like to get 
  together and hang out. It&#39;s fun. :-)<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>I don&#39;t know it is 
  hard to say. I am just not very good at most of the<br>aspects of EQ like 
  camping items and meeting people to play with. I tend to<br>just go where 
  everyone else my level is and join pickup groups. I hate<br>playing alone. It 
  just seems like the game would be ten times better if you<br>had a group of 
  friends to play with.<br>&nbsp; ----- Original Message -----<br>&nbsp; From:

  Welcome back to EQ!<br>&nbsp; I&#39;ve been playing EQ since September of 2000 or 
  so. I obviously enjoy<br>&nbsp; playing. :-) I&#39;m not sure exactly what kind of 
  advice you&#39;re asking for<br>&nbsp; here. Anything specific you need to know 
  about?<br>&nbsp; luv,<br>&nbsp; -Su<br><br>&nbsp; Hi, I bought Everquest the 
  first day it came out. I am not a very good EQ<br>&nbsp; player. I would 
  consider myself ultra competent in group battles, but in<br>&nbsp; other 
  aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I have never gotten a<br>&nbsp; 
  character past level 40. My first character was an Erudite Enchanter 
  by<br>the<br>&nbsp; name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to level 40 
  after two years<br>or<br>&nbsp; so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which 
  was my friends character but<br>I<br>&nbsp; own it. I just started playing 
  again after giving up on the game and<br>playing<br>&nbsp; DAOC. Eventually I 
  gave up all MMORPGS deciding they were a waste of time.<br>&nbsp; About a week 
  ago, I decided to give EQ another chance and have decided<br>that<br>&nbsp; it 
  has improved a great deal. I am now playing a Human Ranger who is 
  level<br>&nbsp; 30. I really like the character. His buffs and damage spells 
  are great. I<br>&nbsp; guess I could use some help on how to be a good EQ 
  player. I have been<br>&nbsp; playing for about two years and I feel like I 
  know absolutely nothing<br>about<br>&nbsp; the game. I have never belonged to 
  a good guild or anything. I play on the<br>&nbsp; Xegony 
  server.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo!
