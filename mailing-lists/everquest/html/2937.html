<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-149514297">Does anyone know a web site where I can get the email address of my servers<br/>
Lead GM? I have a problem, the guide that helped was great a gave us as much<br/>
information as she could and said she would pass it along to the GM. She<br/>
instructed me to do a petition on Sunday through Thursday from 3 pm to 6 pm<br/>
Pacific time. I did this yesterday and no real GM ever showed up and the<br/>
guide that answered me yesterday was a guide and said I would have to keep<br/>
trying. I would like to get his email address to start a dialog about the<br/>
problem I have.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know the web site or the Tunare Lead GM email address?</div>
