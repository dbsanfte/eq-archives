<div id="ygrps-yiv-194804983">Another class that might be good is shadowknight. The drawbacks: Good races<br/>
won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want to kill you. If you play a<br/>
darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally suck but you get pretty<br/>
cool armor when you can manage to find all the stuff you need for it. People<br/>
don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they think of tanks. They don&#39;t often<br/>
invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they get the spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br/>
The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon a pet to tank for you<br/>
while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, and you get a spell that<br/>
snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can solo alot and are a good<br/>
asset to a group. Way later in the game you get to summon your own horse<br/>
called an Unholy Steed.<br/>
My brother started a shadowknight and got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br/>
<br/>
Paladins are welcome in all good cities. Don&#39;t usually have problems selling<br/>
to merchants. Get good damage, duel wield, disarm. Are thought of as tanks<br/>
and can get into group. Can also heal and buff. Can even resurrect. But they<br/>
cannot gate. They can solo pretty well with a good weapon and armor. There<br/>
are newbie paladin armor quests for humans and halfelves in freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Druids, not really great tanks but can snare/root and dot from afar. sucks<br/>
alot of mana. Sometimes they can charm an animal to attack a mob for them.<br/>
But then the animal turns and attacks them when charm wears off. They can<br/>
also track, port, and heal.<br/>
<br/>
If you like things to be more difficult, there&#39;s clerics. They can pretty<br/>
much get into any group because people always seem to want a healer. But<br/>
they can&#39;t really solo much and have alot of downtime from medding.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It depends on your playstyle. Solo or group, this will matter a lot later,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; up, but the warrior will have problems crossing the road without getting<br/>
&gt; killed without a healer back him up. But the warrior is in need in numbers<br/>
&gt; in the highe end raiding game where the druid is an assist class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Answer is: it depends on your goals.<br/>

&gt; I choose to be a Ranger right at the start, maybe a bad choice<br/>
&gt; because i&#39;m dying more often then playing.<br/>
&gt; What is the best way to get started, & and which character is a good<br/>
&gt; newbie character?<br/>
