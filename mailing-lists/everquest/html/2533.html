<div id="ygrps-yiv-251941735">Runs great on my computer, but a little slow on my second computer. But both<br/>
computers are easily playable for 2 group situation encounters. You really<br/>
need to tune your computer so it will run EQ and SoL the best for your<br/>
computer. Verant has some many options now that help cut down on lag. <br/>
<br/>
There is one EQ ini.client program that will help you set all your defaults<br/>
to maximize your performance. The web site is<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uncon.com/reverend/eqiniedit/">http://www.uncon.com/reverend/eqiniedit/</a> The owner of this program really<br/>
stays on top of patches too. He already has a /hitsmode option to help set<br/>
you the way you want it. Although, I still not that happy with the /hitsmode<br/>
options, but it is a step in the right direction. What I want is another<br/>
window, that I can resize that has ALL combat chat in it. Right now, I still<br/>
see my damage shield message, Taunt message and Disarm message. I think<br/>
Verant is really working hard to get all these nice features into the game.<br/>
<br/>
But in your ini client file, you can turn off dynamic lighting, on server<br/>
side filter, on/off armor texture, Texture Quality, Each character module on<br/>
or off and many tracking options. One of the best fixes for SoL on my second<br/>
computer was the use of Umbra. This really helped my zone times in the old<br/>
world and overall lag in all zones.<br/>
<br/>
Try it out, go to the message board and ask for features. I really like this<br/>
program and first used it to get my chat colors just the right color.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 	&gt; Yeah, found out about that a few days after Luclin<br/>
	&gt; came out, still haven&#39;t gone up there to try it out...<br/>
	&gt; Got a strong aversion to Luclin mostly due to how<br/>
	&gt; poorly it ran when I went up there the first few<br/>
	&gt; times. ;) (also I tend to be a creature of habit,<br/>
	&gt; sticking to zones I know :)<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	For the record, does Luclin run slow for everyone? The only time I<br/>
ever go<br/>
	up there is to get spells for my Druid because of the major lag I<br/>
have had<br/>
	there ever since it came out. It takes me twice as long to zone<br/>
there than<br/>
	it does anywhere else in the game.<br/>
