<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015233649">Not to toot my own horn but i run a site dedicated to Trade skills.  The sites current addy is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/System/3274/">http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/System/3274/</a> .  The site is simply has the information from the game put on the web.  Im making guides on each skill i do but i started a new character and so i have to restart my training.  If you can supply some info for my site i would greatly appreciante it.  I&#39;ll be moving my site to a real host.  Namely www.eqshack.com<br/>
<br/>
