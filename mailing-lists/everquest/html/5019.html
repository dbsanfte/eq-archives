<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-254288017008240712-01092003">Hello everyone I&#39;ve got a few&nbsp;questions 
that I hope some of you can help me out with.&nbsp; Ok&nbsp;I haven&#39;t really 
played LoY yet (being that I am in the navy and we went to sea a&nbsp;couple 
of&nbsp;days after it came out and I kept getting booted from the game) and I 
had a chance to go online and check out the latest EQ stuff and I saw these 
monster looking things that you can ride like a horse.&nbsp; I was wondering 
what are these things and are they better than having a 
horse?&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I was wondering is it ture the fastest horse in 
the game is Pegasus?&nbsp; One last thing I was wondering about is that if you 
go to the horse stalls at the bazaar there is this merchant selling various 
items and a couple of them caught my eye, a large bag of plat and a small bag of 
plat both of them costing an insane amount of plat with the small bag costing 
way more than the large... so my question is does anyone know what these bags of 
plat are for and what they do?&nbsp; If anyone can help me out in answering 
these questions I&#39;d appericate it.&nbsp; Happy hunting!</span></div>
