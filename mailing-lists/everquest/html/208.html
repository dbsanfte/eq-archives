	First off, there is a monk only mailing list that you<br/>
can join buy sending a message to:<br/>
<br/>
	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:monk-request@...">monk-request@...</a> with JOIN in the Body.<br/>
<br/>
	And should give you a good place to ask questions<br/>
and get answers about monk things. Also if any are <br/>
interested there is a complete list of all the lists that Jerry<br/>
maintains at:<br/>
 <br/>
	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.internet8.net/lists.htm">http://eq.internet8.net/lists.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
	And all the classes, spoilers, and general info about<br/>
Everquest.<br/>
<br/>
	Now for one of your questions, I too have a level 5 monk<br/>
and have read about different areas to hunt in. From what I have<br/>
read and heard, Misty Thicket is an excellent place to hunt for<br/>
monks 5-10. I am planning on going there soon.<br/>
<br/>
	And I have heard because of the quickness of your hands<br/>
and feet, you should really use hands more than weapons. I<br/>
tried using Rusty Hammers and Worn Great Staffs, but have had<br/>
more success at using my hands and feet. You are supposed to<br/>
get 3 hits in with hands and feet as opposed to 1 with weapons.<br/>
This will come in handy later on when attacking spell casters. <br/>
The quicker you hit them the better chance you will have to <br/>
interupt their spells and without the spells they are dead meat.<br/>
And I know the thing about &quot;Well Weapons do more damage&quot;.<br/>
This is true but if you take by the damage you inflect each <br/>
round you will get more damage with the hands. Ie:<br/>
<br/>
	Hands and Feet @ level 5 (3 punches at 6 each)  18 dmg<br/>
	Hammers @ level 5 (1 hit at 12 dmg)		12 dmg<br/>
<br/>
	Just some things I have found out. Hope this helps<br/>

&gt;Hello All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a 5th level monk in freeport on fennin ro. I<br/>
&gt;decided early on to use dual hammers as weapons this<br/>
&gt;seems to work out well my stats are ( Or close to) DW<br/>
&gt;38 OF 27 Def 28 HTH 12 Kick 17. So here are my<br/>
&gt;questions. One should I give up on the Hammers and<br/>
&gt;just use my fists ( They seem to do simular damage I<br/>
&gt;just like the Hammers) Or should I keep using the<br/>
&gt;hammers or switch to another weapon. Also I have been<br/>
&gt;looking for hammers better than rusty but cant find<br/>
&gt;any to purchase and dont know where to look. I have<br/>
&gt;asked around but to no avail. One more question, where<br/>
&gt;near freeport should I be adventuring to find better<br/>
&gt;stuff. I have tried the bandits but they kill me quick<br/>
&gt;and whoever I am with. The Fire Bugs and Armidillas<br/>
&gt;are the only mobs that still give exp. Every once in a<br/>
&gt;while I can take out a puma or jackal when I can find<br/>
&gt;them. I am a half a bubble away from 6 so my guess is<br/>
&gt;that the Fire Bugs and armmildillas wont be providing<br/>
&gt;exp much longer. Also has anyone ever looted anything<br/>
&gt;from an armidilla? Well any other words of advice<br/>
&gt;would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
