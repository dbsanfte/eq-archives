<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504105492">If you are looking for a new system, I recommend you go with an AMD Athlon<br/>
processor. I know they have had problems with EQ in the past but they cost<br/>
much less than pentiums. I used to be loyal to pentiums but even though my<br/>
mother has more RAM in her computer and a 1.7GHz P4, my system with a 1.4GHz<br/>
AMD (both have same OS and both are HPs) runs faster. It cost $119 for 256M<br/>
of RAM for the P4. I&#39;d have to ask my dad how much he payed for my upcoming<br/>
RAM, but for xmas he&#39;s getting me 1.2GHz of RAM. I also read some articles<br/>
on building new computers and Pentiums run hotter and require special<br/>
sockets and special RAM that all cost more than it costs for AMDs. For a<br/>
modem, you could try a V92 Zoom. I got one for about $21 (not including<br/>
shipping) online. But that&#39;s for phone line modem. Once you figure out what<br/>
you want, look up pricegrabber.com, epinions.com, pricewatch.com, and<br/>
cnet.com. You can compare them and see which one has the lowest price and<br/>
best review.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I bought my machine last year for Christmas. A gift for the family.<br/>
&gt; It was a mid-range system at that time, though I did not know that<br/>
&gt; the 256k memory limit would make it low-end so quickly. I added a 3d<br/>
&gt; card at about six months, not knowing that the standard was moving<br/>
&gt; ahead so fast. With the knowledge I now have, I may have scraped up a<br/>
&gt; bit more and bought higher end, but it was not then a good economic<br/>
&gt; move.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will be adding enough memory in a few weeks to bring my system up<br/>
&gt; to it&#39;s 256k max. I ordered sol in the summer, with the expectation<br/>
&gt; that the 128k minimum would be in place when released. I found that<br/>
&gt; my max would now be the new minimum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As is the system is nominally playable. With the new memory and<br/>
&gt; possibly a new graphics card (fortunately the cost of a gforce 2 has<br/>
&gt; dropped to an easily reachable level) the machine will serve. I<br/>
&gt; expect Sony/V will make improvements in the game to keep lower end<br/>
&gt; players viable for some time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I must plan to upgrade hardware and catch up, perhaps pull ahead<br/>
&gt; of the curve a bit so I am not always catching up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, I am not able to scrape up the $4k bucks for a real<br/>
&gt; kick-ass system like I see in the magazines. I will probably see what<br/>
&gt; a new tower with lots of memory, a gforce 3 and a good sized hard<br/>
&gt; drive will cost me, and begin saving in hopes of getting it online<br/>
&gt; before this system gets too old to play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of us on the lower end, we must hope Sony/V wants our bucks<br/>
&gt; enough to keep us alive a bit longer.<br/>
