that GM was later after they said &quot;never&quot;.<br/>
I have a loooong list of things I&#39;d like to see in game if anyone is<br/>
interested in me posting it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, when I first talked to the EQ people about having different eye<br/>
&gt; &gt; colors, hair styles, and hair colors they told me that they would never<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to do it bc it was too complex. Now they do have it. It just<br/>
depends<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the programming advances they make.<br/>
