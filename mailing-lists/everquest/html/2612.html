<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yeah, I am pretty good in groups. That is the thing 
about rangers I dont like is having to pull, but sometimes it is fun. Rangers 
are the best outdoor pullers. At 30 I have found that I can still be a main 
tank. I concentrate soley on AC.&nbsp;Riftwind&#39;s protection is a great spell 
that really helps your AC. I like being a ranger because, they are surprisingly 
effective at helping out in bad situations. Of course, the wizard and enchanter 
are the best at putting down a bad situation, but the ranger isn&#39;t that bad 
either. If you have a full bar of mana and a decent wis, you can cast your 37hp 
nuke like twenty times. I guess I am saying that Rangers have some&nbsp;control 
over how much damage they deal, whereas the&nbsp;other tanks just do consistent 
damage. If a ranger wants something to die faster they can do that which is 
helpful in a group and something most people and rangers I played with dont 
realize. I understand that&nbsp;as you get older you have to be more aware about 
not&nbsp;drawing agro. I read a post somewhere that says a ranger needs to keep 
their AC at 20 times their level. I am at level 30 and with Riftwinds Protection 
and the new thornskin buff,&nbsp;my AC is exactly 600. I don&#39;t know how I am 
going to get the money to get it any higher. I am still mostly in banded though, 
so I guess it shouldn&#39;t be that hard. I will try to make some friends to play 
with, but I have always had a hard time with that for some reason, maybe I 
should try the friends command. &nbsp;</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Group skills are probably the most important thing 
you can have in the game.&nbsp; As a Ranger you are sometimes asked to pull, and 
you need to know how to do that.&nbsp; Otherwise you&#39;re a backup to the 
tank.&nbsp; The roles change several times during the game as you progress in 
levels.&nbsp; Now I feel how poorly Rangers tank when the Mob puts the smack 
down on me!&nbsp; Maybe I should change my name to Manasponge!
