&gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick off gnolls, and <br/>

&gt; rest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls, which I have <br/>
&gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I want to do it the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found the big boat to FV to be broken too.  Luckily I have a <br/>
friend that&#39;s a Druid so I got a port to the DL.  I tried to petition <br/>
the GM but it doesn&#39;t work if there isn&#39;t one on!<br/>
<br/>
Kunark is a dangerous place for the good races.  The only place you <br/>
can bind a good melee is in FV and it&#39;s surrounded by mid-level <br/>
mobs.  If you port over you end up in the DL, which is ok, it&#39;s just <br/>
getting out of there that&#39;s the problem!  The DL does have <br/>
connections to the FM and FV if you know where to look.  It&#39;s not a <br/>
place to be without a map!<br/>
<br/>
And I am also looking for a place to take me to the mid-40&#39;s.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been to the moon, Kunark, the Karanas and Velious.  I like to go to <br/>
the zones that have been abandoned, like all the dungones on <br/>
Anatonica.  I&#39;m in the FM now and will probably be in the DL, like <br/>
everyone else. <br/>
