One, they need to be<br>&gt; consistence and have one<br>&gt; map that they update off the other maps they have.<br>&gt; Two, No cartoony<br>&gt; maps. It makes things a little too confusing; And<br>&gt; three, Add a legend to<br>&gt; the maps and include a N S E W compass. I&#39;m not<br>&gt; saying they suck, just<br>&gt; would like to see some improvements. Hopefully<br>&gt; Verant&#39;s will be more<br>&gt; consistent. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; As for the dual monitor, It&#39;s easy, just have a<br>&gt; second video card<br>&gt; installed and run EQ on one and your other info on<br>&gt; the other. You may<br>&gt; have to tweak the settings a little but that<br>&gt; shouldn&#39;t be hard to do.<br>&gt; The monitors can be mapped to do this. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; C-ya!<br>&gt; Steve<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; Message: 1<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date: Mon, 26 Aug 2002 14:00:51 -0000<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From: &quot;mlockridge01&quot; &lt;MLockridge01@...&gt;<br>&gt; Subject: Forthcoming Atlas<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I will probably buy the forthcoming atlas, once it<br>&gt; is out. It will be <br>&gt; cheaper than printing up the rest of the maps I<br>&gt; don&#39;t have, since I <br>&gt; have been only printing maps as I need them. Plus,<br>&gt; we ran out of ink <br>&gt; and nobody in my household wants to be the one to<br>&gt; spring for the new <br>&gt; ink. Probably because they know a large number of<br>&gt; maps will be <br>&gt; printed as soon as the ink is loaded. ;)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What I would really like is to have eq in a window,<br>&gt; with a second <br>&gt; monitor to hold my data; maps, charts, lists, and<br>&gt; recipes. I know <br>&gt; there is a hack to allow this, but I would prefer a<br>&gt; sanctioned <br>&gt; window. Plus I don&#39;t have the horsepower on this<br>&gt; system to carry such <br>&gt; a load. My game would suffer.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Twenty bucks for the atlas sounds cheaper all round.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br><br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do You Yahoo!?<br>Yahoo!
