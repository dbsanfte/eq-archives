<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105010040">12 hours? Ouch - glad it worked though!<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that after I did the complete file check that I had <br/>
less problems with my game randomly crashing or with other bugs.  <br/>

&gt; Thanks for the advice.  I clicked the advanced button (which I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; never done before) to fine that my Kunark expansion wasn&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; checked along with the other five....big problem there.  Because I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have high speed internet service, it took 12 hours to update <br/>
&gt; BUT, the problem is now fixed.  Thanks so much for your help! </span></blockquote></div>
