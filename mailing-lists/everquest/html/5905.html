<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-409244587">Can anyone tell me of a website where I can find an explanation of <br/>
the runes, and places they drop for the OOW spells?  I haven&#39;t been <br/>
able to find an in depth explanation.  I can find the new spell <br/>
lists, but not how to acquire them for my cleric. I&#39;m not able to <br/>
play as much as I&#39;d like and I&#39;m having severe angst wanting to <br/>
level to 70 and get all my spells!  Help!  LOL</div>
