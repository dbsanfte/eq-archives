&gt; &gt;im pretty much a newb only been playing a month the<br/>
&gt; &gt;only other place i have travelled is around gfay as<br/>
&gt; &gt;an elf. so as everyone i meet in luclin seems to solo<br/>
&gt; &gt;and are pretty much unfriendly overall, i would<br/>
&gt; &gt;like to ask here if anyone would like to group for a<br/>
&gt; &gt;coupla hours? or if anyone can offer advice?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most classes are capable of soloing thru to lvl 19-20<br/>
&gt; anyways, that&#39;s when the game &quot;begins&quot;. At lvl 13<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re getting into the level range for Crocs in<br/>
&gt; Oasis, just head down there and solo or duo yourself<br/>
&gt; up to 19-20. (groups larger than two people at that<br/>
&gt; point just slow down the experience gain) Since you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; new, i&#39;ll give you directions how to get there. Take<br/>
&gt; the teleport from The Nexus down to West Commonlands,<br/>
&gt; go east from there to the East Commonlands and ask<br/>
&gt; someone to show you where the EC Tunnel is. Go thru<br/>
&gt; the tunnel turning right at the Shady Swashbuckler<br/>
&gt; into Northern Desert of Ro. Head to the left til you<br/>
&gt; hit the water and follow the beach to the Oasis of<br/>
&gt; Marr. Continue following the beach til you get to the<br/>
&gt; docks there, that&#39;s the rest stop in Oasis. Just go<br/>
&gt; further down the beach and look for crocs of various<br/>
&gt; levels to kill. (starting with Crocodiles and Caimans<br/>
&gt; on the low end, til Deepwater Crocs on the high end)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
The Nexus doesn&#39;t go to West Commonlands. It goes to North Karana via the<br/>
Antonica Scion. In which case you have to go through East Karana, Highpass,<br/>
and then West Commons. I think it&#39;s actually safer to take the portal to<br/>
Greater Faydark (the Faydwer Scion), run to Butcherblock Mountains to the<br/>
docks and take the boat to Freeport. then exit the gate in East Freeport to<br/>
run to NrO and then Oasis.<br/>
luv,<br/>
