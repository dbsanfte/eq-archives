<div id="ygrps-yiv-542409541">&lt;&lt; Blackened Iron is nice to look at however..  Banded is a much better choice<br/>
 for a rangers standard issue under level 25.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought I checked that before I switched and got more hp with the blackened <br/>
than the banded (only checked pieces individually).  I still have my <br/>
banded-put it on another of my characters, so I guess I could switch back.<br/>
<br/>
Sure they have<br/>
one less ac as the banded, however they can kick for magic.. that always<br/>
comes in handy. =) <br/>
<br/>
Especially if you want to kick a willowwisp to death!<br/>
