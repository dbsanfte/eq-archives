<b>Subject:</b> A random eq tip, old for some, new for some. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322911629">As im mostly playing 60 bard heres a tip if you are low on wizzies on raid<br/>
end and are having problems porting people out of a dungeon. This is old for<br/>
people in the raid a lot guilds and new for a few here maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Its the matter of druid&#39;s doing translocates.<br/>
<br/>
Heres the setup: It requires a 60 bard and a druid. Have the bard load<br/>
&quot;Kazumi&#39;s note of preservation&quot; (this is a group da song, 3 tick duration).<br/>
Instruct the druid to say when he starts casting his port spell, have the<br/>
bard start Kazumi immediately after druid starts. Those that want to get<br/>
ported, click off the Kazumi&#39;s note effect icon (thus removing da), druid<br/>
keeps it. All that removes da will be ported, rest will bounce and stay in<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
Rinse and repeat as many times needed to safely get all melees out. (Kazumi<br/>
has a little reload time)<br/>
<br/>
This will help a lot instead of having to bind/coth or whatever method you<br/>
have to do to get enough porters.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any useful raiding tip - share it ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I figured it out for myself but im pretty sure others have found it out<br/>
aswell, should be on some messageboard I guess.</div>
