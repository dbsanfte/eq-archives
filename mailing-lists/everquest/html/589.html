<div id="ygrps-yiv-99183262">Well the problem now is that they are stopping twinking by making items NO<br/>
DROP, which ruins the playerbased economy since you can&#39;t trade the<br/>
items at all, I think level caps would be a MUCH better way to deal with<br/>
it.. Level caps and LORE that is..<br/>

&gt;steel and a ghoulbane.  What&#39;s the point of even playing the character?<br/>
&gt;Isnt half the fun getting some of the items yourself?  I can understand<br/>
&gt;and have no problem with some twinking.. maybe some bronze and a pretty<br/>
&gt;good weapon and shield, but that&#39;s just dumb. </span></blockquote></div>
