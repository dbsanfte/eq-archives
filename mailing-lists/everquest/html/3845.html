<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123752419">I currently have a female Wood Elf Ranger. I&#39;m glad you are checking <br/>
this out first before creating one, first let me say that I really <br/>
enjoy mine and she is a blast to play. As for abilities remember, you <br/>
have infravision which will help you see in the dark better than some <br/>
other races. It&#39;s not perfect but it helps. Also you will be a caster <br/>
after lvl 7 so keep that in mind when allocating your extra points. <br/>
Wood Elves are realatively small and aren&#39;t the most strong <br/>
characters to play but they make up for in so many other areas! One <br/>
thing to keep in mind is SoW, you won&#39;t get it until lvl30, this has <br/>
been p***ing me off, I want it SOOOO bad! lol!<br/>
According to the Official EQ Player&#39;s Guide a Ranger is primarily a <br/>
mele fighter & part caster and to raise Dex, STR, and WIS first <br/>
followed by Agil, Int, and Char. I made the mistake of raising my Int <br/>
and not my Wis and it really has hindered my casting. Also look for <br/>
items that buff your WIS and INT like jewelry, this will help too. <br/>
Another tip for you to help raise your ability as a Ranger is to <br/>
place Sense Heading and Track as your first two hot buttons. Then <br/>
under the Options section map those two hot keys to your left and <br/>
right arrows or whatever you use to turn your character. This way <br/>
everytime you turn it will activate one or the other and before you <br/>
know it your skill level in them will shoot through the roof! <br/>
Oh one more tip, if you decide to try the Trushot Armor Quest be sure <br/>
to grab several Orc Fibulas if they tend to drop a lot, you will need <br/>
at least 5 I think but try to grab about 10. They are non-drop so <br/>
unfortunately you can&#39;t sell or give away the extras. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</div>
