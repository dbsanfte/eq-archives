<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes.&nbsp; Adventures are open to groups of 
people.&nbsp; You must have a group where all the people are within 7 levels of 
each other.&nbsp; The group can be a minimum of 4 people but I find adventures 
are REALLY difficult with that few people.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have a group of 
people looking for an adventure, the group leader will request an adventure 
fromt he Adventure Recruiter .&nbsp; Adventures come in 3 basic types: collects, 
assassinate, and rescue.&nbsp; In a collect you have to colelct so many of a 
particular item in a 90 minute time period.&nbsp; In an assassinate, you have to 
kil a specific named in a 90 minute time period, and in a rescue you have to 
find a particular name and free them in a 90 minute time period.&nbsp; If you 
succeed you are awardewd adventure points which you can later redeem with an 
Adventure Merchant for cool items and spells.&nbsp; If you fail, then you have 
an additional 30 minutes within the adventure zone to try and complete the 
mission for a lesser number of adventure points.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Some things to know about adventures, the 90 minute 
timer starts as soon as the first person enters the adventure zone, so better 
make sure your grouped is buffed and ready with full mana when you enter.&nbsp; 
You do have 20 minutes to get to the zone and prepare after the adventure is 
requested.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Everyone in the group is guaranteed XP.&nbsp; It&#39;s 
a quick way to gain xp fast.&nbsp; And depending on your level you could even 
level quickly or gain AA points.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Mobs in an adventure zone DO NOT respawn!!&nbsp; 
This is &quot;A Very Good Thing&quot; since when you die in an adventure you have to get 
back to your corpse.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the mob is dead, it stays dead. 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There are generally a few traps set in the 
adventure zone.&nbsp; These are generally triggered by moving into the trapped 
area.&nbsp; Most of the times they are DOTs (damage over time spells) which can 
be a constant drain on your group&#39;s health.&nbsp; Sometimes they can be objects 
such as chests or boxes which will explode if you get too close.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Adventures can be easy, Normal, or Hard.&nbsp; The 
number of points you receive for success vary depending on the difficulty of the 
adventure.&nbsp; You get more points for a Hard adventure.&nbsp; The most 
popular adventure is a Collect because they are generally the easiest to 
finish.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You can start adventuring at level 20, but you can 
get the adventure stone at level 15 in order to use the Magus at each camp to 
translocate you from camp to camp.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, this is about all I can think of that you 
should know for adventures.&nbsp; I am sure you will learn much more, but with 
any luck you&#39;ll be getting good loot in no time!&nbsp; Good luck with your 
adventures!</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>I haven&#39;t played in months. Just got back in a couple days 
  ago. My<br>Halfling Druid lvl 42 returned to Rivervale, and I got this 
  whispered<br>message to meet a NPC. I had seen the message before, but since I 
  had<br>nothing else going on, I responded. As a result I went searching for 
  a<br>camp of adventurers. I talked to whom I had been directed to, and 
  was<br>encouraged to go on missions for them. However, I haven&#39;t found 
  anyone<br>in the camp in Butcherblock nor the camp in East Commonlands who 
  will<br>give me a mission. Anyone know about this Adventure business, or 
  some<br>place I can look?<br><br>Oh, it was sure interesting spending the 
  night in East Commonlands. It<br>used to be lowbee heaven, but I found myself 
  actually fighting for my<br>life and wondering if I might actually have to 
  run. It was rather fun.<br>A positive change.<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br>42nd
