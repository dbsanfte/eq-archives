<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947040499">Ok, that makes sense. I was kicking butt pretty good with it so I<br/>
couldn&#39;t figure out why I was getting that message, I seemed to be<br/>
&quot;commanding&quot; that weapon pretty well I thought!  ;)<br/>

&gt; Hi again everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Yesterday I was playing Genmay, my Gnome Warrior and I&#39;m <br/>
using a<br/>
&gt; mace as my weapon. I kept getting a message saying something like my<br/>
&gt; will isn&#39;t right to command this weapon. What does that mean? That <br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not able to use it or more specifically my class doesn&#39;t wield this<br/>
&gt; weapon as well as others? Heck I seemed to be kicking some butt <br/>
with it<br/>
&gt; as my hits were ranking between 12-16 points each. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have a Velium weapon.  Those are pretty common <br/>
anymore.  They come in almost all weapon types and are easy to find.  <br/>
They usually go for around 10 plat.  Most people use them because <br/>
they are magic and they can hunt magic only mobs.  Their ratios are <br/>
good until about 20, then you should be able to get better.<br/>
