<div id="ygrps-yiv-855593816">Yea, I remember reading somewhere that it&#39;s really <br/>
popular over there. I think it was last month&#39;s <br/>
Playstation magazine. However I think it&#39;s even cooler <br/>
that Denver was #4! <br/>
I was also looking at some of the other things EQ <br/>
players like to meet about, witches, hmmm. I keep <br/>
telling my wife she needs to play! ;D Ha ha ha! j/k!</div>
