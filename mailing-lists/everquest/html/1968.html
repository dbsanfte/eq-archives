<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001548982">My internet connection sucks SOOOO bad, that after doing a system restore <br/>
and reinstalling eq, I haven&#39;t been able to experience the SoL probs, I got <br/>
my own...<br/>
<br/>
All I gotta say is.... DAoC - no probs for me so far(I was able to download <br/>
the patches just fine with the crappy internet connection), where as eq has <br/>
been nothing but probs for the year (1 year on xmas hehe) that I&#39;ve been <br/>
TRYING to play /sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Verant better get its act in gear, cause with DAoC out and running well, <br/>
they can&#39;t afford to lose the customer base that I&#39;m predicting.<br/>
