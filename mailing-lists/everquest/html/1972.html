&gt; that the internet runs right, only voice is what they are required to make<br/>
&gt; run well. Bunch of Bull &%*(, I know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They are still legally obligated to keep the lines clear for voice. If you<br/>
hear static then they are supposed to fix it. Don&#39;t mention internet to<br/>
them. Mention static on the lines when you&#39;re talking. When I spoke to qwest<br/>
a dialtone wasn&#39;t the only concern. They are supposed to keep the lines<br/>
clear enough to hear without static. Although I feel your pain. Not only am<br/>
I in a house with wiring about 30 years old, but I live out in the country.<br/>
The box with the phone lines just down the road is knocked over. I&#39;m also<br/>
behind a slick (which means they split the phone lines up to share amongst<br/>
other people so I have huge bandwidth loss). The fastest I have ever<br/>
connected since moving here is 26k. And that is with a really good modem.<br/>
Before the good modem I was getting 21k. I actually need to remember to call<br/>
the phone company back and complain about the static on my lines...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; files (and I didn&#39;t mention that some files keep re-downloading) and email<br/>
&gt; him the names of them and he&#39;d email the files to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a fix or troubleshooting guide on the eq website that specifically<br/>
mentions certain files downloading over and over.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t get what verants prob is....DAoC works GREAT, no probs<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; surfing the net is a bit slow, but managable, even downloading music isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; this big production that I need a damn tech support guy to help me do what<br/>
&gt; should be a simple task. He said DX8.1 is also required to even download<br/>
&gt; some of the files SHEESH<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah. They are being annoying about it. I&#39;ve noticed that Verant has the<br/>
attitude that the customers are out to screw them and approach us with<br/>
mistrust. Really sad. They have completely forgotten rule #1 of game<br/>
making-- make it FUN!<br/>
I think Maxis is much cooler in that regard. They even incorporate user<br/>
created skins and objects into their expansion packs.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, and for all of you having SoL probs....he informed me that the are<br/>
&gt; &#39;working on it&#39;, that they can&#39;t do things all speedy like, cause then if<br/>
&gt; they screw up, they can&#39;t go back and fix it (say what???since when can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; you go back and fix something?) /sigh<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it might be more difficult to go back and fix it after it&#39;s screwed up<br/>
than to just take it slow and get it right the first time.<br/>
