 </span></blockquote>Begging isn&#39;t useless, it just takes for ever to skill up.  Mind you, <br/>
you won&#39;t get attacked if you practice your begging on:<br/>
<br/>
1. your pet<br/>
2. NPC that don&#39;t attack, like those in POK<br/>
3. Boats.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, certain classess use begging better than others - for instance <br/>
Bard/Rogue are better at begging than the other classes (I think <br/>
Rogue is the only one to be able to reach 200, but I&#39;m at work so I <br/>
can&#39;t check right now).  <br/>
<br/>
Max out CHA (the stat that affects Begging), and get a skill of 200 <br/>
in Begging - and walla, you have a pretty safe way to get a few gold, <br/>
on occassion a plat or two.  Of course, this takes forever, but if <br/>
you have nothing better to do.<br/>
<br/>
Its a lot like Alcohol tolerance, some people think its useless, but <br/>
some people try drunken fighting anyways, and like it - though I have <br/>
not personally seen much impact on the melee classes in my groups <br/>
when they do or do not use it (other than the occasional running in <br/>
circles thing).  <br/>
<br/>
However a much better way to use begging is actually as a minor <br/>
taunt.  Its not Perfect, but if you can set a hot key up to turn off <br/>
auto attack, beg, then auto attack, you can use it as a mini taunt - <br/>
since they are already mad at you - they might turn their attention <br/>
to you (of course, if you don&#39;t have taunt to begin with, you <br/>
probably shouldn&#39;t be tanking, but I&#39;ll let you make that decision).</div>
