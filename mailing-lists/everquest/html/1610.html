 size="2">Actually there are a couple of viruses that were made specifically for 
EverQuest, and they were quite successful.. If you know how much money some 
people have made on just ebaying legit loot then you can figure out how much 
they can make from spreading a simple EQ virus to gain access to hundreds of 
accounts(I&#39;ve had one guildmate this year that had a virus like that, she ended 
up being banned).. They get your account info, ebay all tradable loot then they 
sell the account itself.. Unfortunately the buyer is screwed since the real 
owner will report the theft most likely.. But the virus programmer still makes a 
bundle.. :(</font></span></div>

  <p><em>Ok I had never thought about getting my account &quot;hacked&quot; into. &nbsp;I 
  would have <br>thought that as long as I didn&#39;t give out my information that I 
  would be <br>safe.</em></p>
  <p>That&#39;s cause you are safe..&nbsp; The odds of anyone hacking your system.. 
  or anyone else&#39;s system just to get your everquest account is next to 
  nothing.&nbsp; Sure it happens every now and then due to the lack of players 
  realizing their personal responsibility to protect themselves on the 
  Internet.&nbsp; If your handing your account information out to other 
  players/not running uptodate anti-virus programs/personal firewalls/etc. 
  then&nbsp;they have no one to blame but themselves.&nbsp; There&#39;s certainly 
  more personal information about them that would be more important 
  to&nbsp;&quot;hackers&quot; other then your Everquest account.&nbsp; Those protection 
  programs are easy to install and maintain - most are automatic with the least 
  amount of input from the end-user.&nbsp; If someone is &quot;sniffing&quot; the packets 
  from your computer, you&#39;ve got a much larger problem then worrying if they 
  have compromised your EQ account.</p>
