&gt; I agree and understsand most of this but what or how<br/>
&gt; does a ranger aggro control?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mine is 18 and I find it a little tough getting exp<br/>
&gt; right now.  High Pass Hold is always too busy.  I am<br/>
&gt; trying Sk with the KFC birds but as you said, I need a<br/>
&gt; good tank and healer since anything higher than a<br/>
&gt; Darkter wastes me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well at 50+, it gets easier to control aggro with Jolt, and eventually<br/>
Cinder Jolt and Jolting Blades.  Pre-50, it involves not taunting, knowing<br/>
when to snare a mob, the distance that you fight a mob, etc.  Even backing<br/>
away from a mob for a second or 2 can do a good enough job.<br/>
