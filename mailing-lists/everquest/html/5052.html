&gt; If any of your group members go LD during the crawl and can&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; back on quickly you&#39;re pretty much screwed. And it&#39;s very difficult<br/>
&gt; to do some of the adventures without a mezzer.<br/>
&gt; And sometimes if you have to locate a mob and kill it before a certain<br/>
&gt; time-period is up, the mob doesn&#39;t spawn until literally 3 minutes<br/>
&gt; before time is up and you can&#39;t get to it before then. I haven&#39;t had<br/>
&gt; much luck, but hopefully the next time I actually get to play I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; have better luck. I think the 7 level difference sucks though.<br/>

has been cleared (so I hear) so killing the regular mobs quicker will<br/>
give you more time to spare. And Track is your friend =)<br/>
