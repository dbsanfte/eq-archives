&gt; tech question...have an SB Live! sound card...get sounds fine for effects<br/>
&gt; etc. but no music ever...is there a known problem with this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To get music with the SB Live! you have to ensure you can download the<br/>
sound fonts.  To do this go to Audio HQ and run the SoundFont program.<br/>
From there go to options and ensure that your static caching is around<br/>
10Mb or so.  It won&#39;t use it all up, it just needs to know it can load<br/>
in a 3Mb sound font.<br/>
<br/>
My SB Live! works great and I just love how the music sounds.  Very good<br/>
soundtrack indeed.  The 3D sound support really helps to track down<br/>
those pesky monsters as well.</div>
