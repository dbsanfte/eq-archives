<div id="ygrps-yiv-554261415"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Me and my friend were having a discussion the other night while he<br/>
&gt; was playing eq, he was talking to his eq wife, and i was messing<br/>
&gt; with him, and if brought up the questions of, are there really girls<br/>
&gt; that play eq, or are the all guys. Then he asked me, if there are<br/>
&gt; girls that play, are they cute? Just curious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you asking if they are cute or if there are girls? lol.<br/>
My sister got me into playing EQ and I know quite a few women who play. My<br/>
mother even plays.<br/>
So to the first part of the question, yes, girls do play EQ. I saw some<br/>
pictures on the tribunal boards of some of the girls who play EQ so there<br/>
are some cute ones. Assuming those are actually their real photos.<br/>
luv,<br/>
