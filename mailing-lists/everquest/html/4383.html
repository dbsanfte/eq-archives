Do you mean that Clurg&#39;s goon has left Ogguk and I might be able to <br/>
give him the Stein components? I a bit lost - as usual LOL<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;there are three classes who you should be looking for:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>- rogues: if you know the location where you died, but other classes <br/>
have problems to get there and back again, get an rogue. the <br/>
sneak&hide makes them invisible to most of the critters throughout <br/>
the world.<br/>
- necros & SKs: they can summon a corpse ... it isn&#39;t cheap,<br/>
but before you will loose some &quot;special&quot; items, they can help.<br/>
<br/>
Does these classes RES you? And could I make myself a Rogue, SK or <br/>
Necro and RES my Enchantress corpse?</div>
