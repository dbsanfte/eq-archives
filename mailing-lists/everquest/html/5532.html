<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269393759">Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I would introduce myself. My name is<br/>
Cary. I&#39;m 25 years old married. Both my husband and I<br/>
play EQ. He is the one that got me hooked. <br/>
<br/>
My Characters:<br/>
Venetia Valgrave - Lvl 43 Ench High elf - Currently<br/>
gaining exp to dungeon groups and not liking it<br/>
<br/>
Clawdya Valgrave Lvl 23 - Beastlord Kitty - Currently<br/>
in PC<br/>
<br/>
I play on the the Tarew Marr server with my husband<br/>
Morrdak Valgrave who is a lvl 52 Iksar SK. Also a<br/>
bunch of My RL friends play on that server. We all<br/>
have the family name of Valgrave. Its pretty funny.<br/>
Hehe<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to level to 46 as quickly as possible so I<br/>
can level in POJ with my friends who are in their 50&#39;s<br/>
now. It sucks not being able to level with them. The<br/>
Dungeon groups suck because everybody is sooo rude and<br/>
I have been jipped out of split 4 times now. <br/>
<br/>
Well I just thought I would introduce myself! <br/>
<br/>
Cary<br/>
