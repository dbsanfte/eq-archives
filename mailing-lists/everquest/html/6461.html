<div>You&#39;re not doing anything wrong.&nbsp; You&#39;re doign exactly what itis beastlords tend to do in soloing. So nothing wrong with that.&nbsp; The new zones were designed to be tough.&nbsp; Otherwise, what&#39;s the point?&nbsp; They do, however, call for active grouping.&nbsp; I have seen, though, level 70 enchanters solo the zone with their pets and using charm kiting.&nbsp; I daresay a chanter/necro combo would be an awesome duo kiting group in Corranthus.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t want to do full gruops, look into duo kiting then.&nbsp; One or two bad experiences isn&#39;t usually enough to make me quit grouping all together.&nbsp; I might solo for awhile and then go back to grouping and hope I find a good one.&nbsp; When in doubt, join a guild and group with them for awhile.&nbsp; It usually helps alleviate the run of bad groups.</div>
