<div id="ygrps-yiv-231920581"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;One thing to watch for: Gate easts a LOT of mana at<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sets up a good rule of thumb though anyways. Usually<br/>
when you&#39;re down to 20% mana it&#39;s time to start<br/>
considering gating. Nothing worse than getting stuck<br/>
doing that &quot;snare, run, med, root, med some more, pray<br/>
root doesn&#39;t break, med up enough mana for a DOT, run,<br/>
try to get up enough mana for another root&quot; juggling<br/>
routine. :)<br/>

&gt; As does sow. And it costs around 8pp.<br/>
&gt; My druid just dinged 14 and the spells were pretty<br/>
&gt; expensive.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s been quite a while. :) As for the expense of the<br/>
spells, that&#39;s part of why I recommend EC as a hunting<br/>
grounds up til around lvl 10-12, HQ Bear Pelts and<br/>
Spider Silk are the two best methods of making some<br/>
quick cash for a new player. Stacks of Bone Chips<br/>
aren&#39;t bad either. All are easily available in EC and<br/>
WC, and in the latter you can kill bears/spiders up<br/>
til around lvl 15.<br/>
