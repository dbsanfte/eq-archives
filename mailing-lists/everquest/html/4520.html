<b>Subject:</b> Re: I have a question about eqgame.exe <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-208205663">I had this problem after a large patch that they put on. I am using <br/>
XP. I called Sony and was on the phone with them for 20 minutes until <br/>
they found out I have a laptop, then they said they couldn&#39;t help me :<br/>
( I posted the error on the Allakhazam site (with all the info on my <br/>
eqclient.ini and dxdialog files) and they didn&#39;t help. Someone on the <br/>
Everquest chat channel told me to delete my eqclient.ini file, which <br/>
didn&#39;t help either. I ended up using my system restore, and restored <br/>
the system to the day before I started getting the eqgame.exe error <br/>
and it has been working fine ever since. Good luck to you, hope you <br/>
get it going soon.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have an idea as to why Sony won&#39;t support me because I <br/>
use a laptop?<br/>
