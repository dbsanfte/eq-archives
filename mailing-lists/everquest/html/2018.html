<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309765956">Theres a difference between low end and a door stop.  EQ still supports low<br/>
end.  It&#39;s the obsolete systems that were still able to play before that<br/>
have been left in the cold.  Don&#39;t worry they will find a way to play.  Make<br/>
sure ya buy the right memory, if ya need help let us know.<br/>
<br/>
Memory and other equip.. www.googlegear.com nice, cheap, honest, reliable.<br/>

Yes, and maybe $265 isn&#39;t that much for you. But to some other people that&#39;s<br/>
a hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a rent-to-own<br/>
basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s easy to say they<br/>
should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an escape for them. To suddenly<br/>
not be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way Verant<br/>
could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so financially<br/>
stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if nothing else. Btw,<br/>
someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap? Where was that again? I<br/>
just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of RAM with it&#39;s motherboard and<br/>
chipset. luv, -Su<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not cost <br/>
&gt; that much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me <br/>
&gt; $265 after tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.  The <br/>
&gt; chip is a AMD Athlon 950.<br/>
