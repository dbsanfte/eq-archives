&gt; Loved the article.  I used to be subscribed to the Rialto but I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; keep up with that and a.g.everquest too.  That come off the SCA-cooks<br/>
&gt; list?  that&#39;s an active mailing list, couldn&#39;t keep up with that one<br/>
&gt; either before I even got EQ.  SCA is totally too time consuming for me<br/>
&gt; right now.  Still got my garb and other stuff around the house but<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t been to fighter practice or an event in over a year.  Hubby had<br/>
&gt; his name go through but I haven&#39;t done mine yet, his official name is<br/>
&gt; Wolfgang Schwarzvald, my SCA name is the same one I use in EQ--Bebinn<br/>
&gt; Maolcataig, Bebinn is the name of Brian Boru&#39;s mother and the surname is<br/>
&gt; Mulcahy at around the same time period.  I don&#39;t anticipate any problems<br/>
&gt; with getting it to pass when I decide to rejoin the SCA.  BTW what<br/>
&gt; kingdom are you in?  I&#39;m in Atlantia, Barony of Bright Hills, in<br/>
&gt; probably the only barony that has 2 Barons instead of a Baron and<br/>
&gt; Baroness, I keep up on local Barony news, the elected Baron is a good<br/>
&gt; friend of mine and his consort is his husband.  I love them both and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a very stressful job they have.  There was opposition to his<br/>
&gt; consort at first because he wasn&#39;t a woman, sheesh, you don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt; have a male/female couple to run the barony.  Just have to have 2 people<br/>
&gt; who can keep the barony together up there in the fancy chairs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; See ya<br/>
