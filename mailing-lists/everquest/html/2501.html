<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-581430057">I was on EQ and got booted. I tried to get back on and it kept getting to<br/>
the login screen. everytime it said Error 1001 could not connect to server.<br/>
I tried to load the official EQ webpage. File not found.<br/>
Hours later my mom tried on her account. Same thing.<br/>
Then mom finally got logged in over 12 hours later. she got to character<br/>
select. then tried to login a character but got booted out and got the same<br/>
error 1001. Grrr.<br/>
Anyone else have this problem?<br/>
