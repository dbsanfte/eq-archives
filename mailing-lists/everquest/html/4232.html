<div id="ygrps-yiv-759214413"><p>OK maybe this will work this time. I am trying to find someone and I know they like EverQuest ALOT. His real name is Greg and on EQ he&#39;s a big white polar bear(&lt;--- I know that&#39;s dumb, all polar bears are white) named Sean Connery. If anyone knows him and can talk to him or tell me how to find him on EQ or whatever please let me know. Thank you.</p>
