<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116930745">Yup, I kick those people out.  The groups I am in now we don&#39;t FFA, Alpha or<br/>
roll for anything that&#39;s not a special drop.  I would say 99% of the time<br/>
the group picks someone we can trust and someone with more than two bags of<br/>
free space to hold loot and that person loots everything and when its time<br/>
for someone to leave he splits the pp and the items that he has looted.<br/>
This system works very well for most the groups I have been in.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] About loot order<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems with<br/>
loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br/>
healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br/>
totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>
loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they care<br/>
about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>
&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>
chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>
still loot out of turn.<br/>
And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>
When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>
ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>
picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an expensive<br/>
item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>
bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>
for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
Just wondering.<br/>
luv,<br/>
-Su<br/>
ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>
people cooperate.<br/>
