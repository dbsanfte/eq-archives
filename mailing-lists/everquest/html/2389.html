Sadly, no, there is no way to speed it up, except to get a faster<br/>
connection. Verant is constantly &quot;improving&quot; Everquest. The stuff that is<br/>
taking forever for you to download would be all the patches and upgrades<br/>
that they have done to the game since the disk you bought was created. There<br/>
is a *lot* of it, too -- I know just what you are talking about, because I<br/>
recently had to re-install the game.<br/>
<br/>
The only solution other than a faster connection is patience, grasshopper =)<br/>
