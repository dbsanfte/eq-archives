&gt;As to your rant :) ( of course on my post.. hehe )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What solutions do you have?  What ideas do you have? I&#39;m sure we would all<br/>
&gt;like to listen to a few suggestions. You can&#39;t be a lone ranger and submit<br/>
&gt;them yourself and expect changes to occur.. We all need to work together,<br/>
&gt;unfortunately I here a lot of complaining yet no set forth solutions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hint us in on a few, we might just agree.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(and this is in no way a flame)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Didn&#39;t meant to imply that you were flaming, nor do I take your suggestion <br/>
as such.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s just a few suggestions (of many) that have been made to Verant:<br/>
<br/>
1.) To spur a &quot;player run&quot; economy, add in item durability on armor, weapons <br/>
and such. The appropriate trade skill could repair the items durability - IE <br/>
smithing for armor and weapons, tailoring for clothing and tailor made <br/>
items, bowyer/fletching to fix bows etc etc. If the player made repairs in a <br/>
shop with all the &quot;tools&quot; needed are assume to be handy, then there&#39;d be no <br/>
reduction in the items durability. If it was done &quot;out in the field&quot;, IE not <br/>
in a shop with the proper tools, then there&#39;d be a permanent reduction in <br/>
the max durability of the item. Also, have NPC&#39;s that you could go to who <br/>
could also make these repairs (of course the NPC would charge more). If the <br/>
items durability hits zero, then there&#39;d be a chance of it breaking every <br/>
time it was used. If the item breaks, it would be permanently and totally <br/>
useless.<br/>
<br/>
2.) Have additional modes of transportation in the future add on - IE <br/>
Horses, Flying Mounts etc. as an alternative to JBoots. The graphics are <br/>
already in the game for them both. It would take some minor adjustments to <br/>
add them in, and make them fully functional.<br/>
<br/>
3.) Have NPC&#39;s in key locations that you could pay to bind you to an area. <br/>
Would have fixed the need to remove the Ring of the Dead (which should have <br/>
worked before they put it on the live servers). Instead, they removed the <br/>
ring (another band aid patch).<br/>
<br/>
4.) Have rubi as a lore, no drop quest loot for a long, involved and hard <br/>
quest. Would have fixed the need to remove it to decrease camping/farming of <br/>
the armor. Instead, they removed it.</div>
