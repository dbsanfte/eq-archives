<div><font face="Arial" size="2">What happened was Sony wasnt using the Direct X 
engine to run the graphics, they were using their own.&nbsp; Recently they 
decided to change the engine to Direct X9 for some reason.&nbsp; The end result 
so far that I&#39;ve seen is lag, delays in computer responding to casting or 
pulling, LDs, some people falling through the earth and ending up in mid-space, 
even dying as a result of falling through.&nbsp; Have no idea why this is 
happening so often, but my guild leader cant hardly play anymore since he tends 
to LD just crossing a zone (has even fallen through the earth and died one 
time.)&nbsp; Not sure when they will finally get it ironed out, but hope its 
soon.</font></div>

  <div>I&#39;ve not been playing for a while now, but this has made me 
curious.</div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div>I upgraded to DX9 last summer so I could play SWG. Then I started playing 
  EQ again last fall, still using DX9. I didn&#39;t notice any difference, just my 
  usual lag in PoK and the bazaar. So, is it the DX9 that&#39;s messing everyone up, 
  or some &quot;upgrade&quot; that SOE did to the graphic 
  engine?<br><br><b><i>arthiliel_tintalle &lt;arthiliel@...&gt;</i></b>

    buying a new video card as someone else suggested, I would <br>try 
    installing the new 56.64 drivers from NVIDIA first. Your card is <br>not 
    that old. It&#39;s part of the GeForce4 series which is one series <br>before 
    GeForce FX (in case anyone didn&#39;t know). The 56.64 drivers <br>support your 
    card. Also, to reduce headaches, set a restore point <br>before upgrading 
    the video drivers. I prefer to uninstall and re-<br>install drivers in Safe 
    Mode. In this way, you&#39;re sure the system <br>isn&#39;t using any of the driver 
    files.<br><br>If you look at SOE&#39;s required specs (forget recommended 
    specs), I <br>believe that your system meets or exceeds their 
    requirements.<br><br><a rel="nofollow"
