<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979070793">When I go to train with my Guildmaster I sometimes get the message, &quot;You<br/>
have reached your maximum level in that skill&quot; or something to that effect.<br/>
At that time I can&#39;t increase that skill any more.  None of the skills I get<br/>
it on are ever over 100.  Is there a limit to how high a skill can go based<br/>
on level, or is it based on something else?<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about my Iksar Monk and my Human Paladin.  The Iksar has a<br/>
negative modifier to exp, the Human has a positive one.  Both are at the<br/>
same level now and my Iksar has higher skill numbers for Offense, Defense<br/>
and his primary fighting skills and could easily take my Pal in a fight.  I<br/>
was thinking that making the Iksar advance slower is bad in that it takes<br/>
longer to get access to more powerful skills, but good in that it takes more<br/>
fighting to get to the same point, and more fighting means more skills<br/>
advancement.  If those facts are correct, I would rather have the negative<br/>
modifier.</div>
