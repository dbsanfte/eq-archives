<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700154179">I heard that Sony has a subscription plan that lets you sub to multiple<br/>
games or something. I forget what it&#39;s called, but I saw it on their website<br/>
one day. I might consider trying EQ2. I wish I could get on their beta<br/>
testers list.<br/>

Me, personally, I plan on getting EQ2 as soon as it comes out, for as you<br/>
said, I&#39;d like to be there from the start.  However, I will not stop playing<br/>
EQ1 either.  I have two computers.  :)   One for EQ one for EQII.   and if I<br/>
have to, I&#39;ll build another one!  MUWAHAHAHAHA!!!<br/>
<br/>
Not that I&#39;m addicted or anything...  no... not me...  addiction?  dont know<br/>
the meaning of the word?<br/>
<br/>
