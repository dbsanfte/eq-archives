<div id="ygrps-yiv-639847184">I went Linkdead about 2 hours after the GM spoke to me. She didn&#39;t tell me<br/>
no to loot my corpse. I went and looted it an hour after talking to her<br/>
(that&#39;s how long it took me just to get back to my corpse).<br/>
Actually, there is a way they can give you xp without rezzing you. They did<br/>
it for my mum once when she wasn&#39;t get xp for stuff. They determined that<br/>
there was a glitch and gave her xp.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;The worst part was, I lost my level.. and I still<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t gotten back after a week. I lost 3 blue<br/>
&gt; bubbles of xp. :-( What do you folks think? Should I<br/>
&gt; repetion?<br/>

&gt; I doubt there&#39;s anything a GM can do now.  Since<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve probably looted your corpse completely, they<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t rez you for experience.  That really sucks that<br/>
&gt; they didn&#39;t get back with you, though.  How long were<br/>
&gt; you online between talking to the GM and logging out?<br/>
&gt; Because your petition gets removed from the queue when<br/>
&gt; you log off your character ... if she was still<br/>
&gt; looking into it, and you logged, there wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; been anything left for her to do because you weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; online.<br/>
