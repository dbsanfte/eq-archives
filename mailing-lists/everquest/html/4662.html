&gt; Fellow EverQuest&#39;ers. I am a communications student at the <br/>
&gt; University of Washington in Seattle, WA. For a class I&#39;m taking,<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; have to write a paper about Everquest. It would REALLY help me <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you would like more info on the class I&#39;m taking, the course <br/>
&gt; website is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/redwood/com480/">http://faculty.washington.edu/redwood/com480/</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you very much. My grade depends on you. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just can&#39;t believe a prof got away with being able to play EQ DURING a <br/>
class.  How much EQ do you guys actually get to experience?  I&#39;m curious <br/>
now.  Ya&#39;ll can&#39;t be getting the full immersive experience with a prof <br/>
tagging along.  Own up, does he make ya&#39;ll raid something for phat lewt <br/>
and keep the stuff for himself?  If he doesn&#39;t have an established <br/>
character that is profiting from this I&#39;ll eat my hat.<br/>
<br/>
Was just reading the weblog entries at livejournal.  Someone was talking <br/>
about offering 5pp to someone for taking the survey.  One of the people <br/>
who they got to take the survey was a level 40.  Level 40 people KNOW <br/>
that you are a newbie if you think 5pp is alot of money.  Also, most <br/>
long time players don&#39;t trust people doing interviews.  We haven&#39;t <br/>
gotten very good press, there has been various times when some players <br/>
have helped someone with similar interviews and then it&#39;s come back and <br/>
bitten us in the behind.  Look up stories from when that poor <br/>
unfortunate young man killed himself and his mom blamed it on EQ for <br/>
some examples, sorry I don&#39;t have any urls at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Since it seems ya&#39;ll have a class of raw newbies, some EQ urls for ya: <br/>
&lt;everquest.allakhazam.com&gt;  more quest information than you can ever process<br/>
&lt;eq.crgaming.com&gt;  class-specific information for every class, spell <br/>
info and what skills you should have for each level.<br/>
ya&#39;ll have eqatlas already on the links page.<br/>
&lt;www.eqtraders.com&gt; trade-skills information,EQ isn&#39;t just about kill <br/>
the monster for experience, also look up the quests page on that site, <br/>
then look for your class and race, every newbie has a newbie armor quest <br/>
to keep them busy.<br/>
and for Tunare&#39;s sake, get thyselves away from Misty Thicket unless you <br/>
really really need the newbie armor quest materials.  See more of <br/>
Norrath, you won&#39;t regret it.</div>
