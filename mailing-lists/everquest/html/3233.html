<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967204454">Oh, I know that feeling. I get sooo many rez requests for my cleric. I mean,<br/>
I will get people who contact me when I am in GD and want me to rez them in<br/>
Guk. And I&quot;m not even talking about guildies.. My guildies are fairly nice<br/>
about that. There have been maybe 2 people in guild (not counting the ones<br/>
related to me by blood) who annoyed me by wanting me to drop everything to<br/>
go either rez or powerlevel them. The rezzing doesn&#39;t bother me. I did over<br/>
33 rezzes in 2 days. I received donations for 2 of them. But I felt good<br/>
having helped people. I generally only ask for a rez if I can&#39;t get back to<br/>
my own corpse to rez it-- or if I&#39;m playing my bard or wizard.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; In regards to death in game and such.  There was a time<br/>
&gt; when our highest level Cleric at the time was so<br/>
&gt; inundated with requests from  guildies to rez them<br/>
&gt; everytime they died.  It didn&#39;t matter that  there was a<br/>
&gt; cleric in the zone that was happy to do the rez, for a<br/>
&gt; small donation in most cases.  But the people that<br/>
&gt; either had not been smart enough to carry enough pp on<br/>
&gt; them or were just too cheap to donate for the rez were<br/>
&gt; mostly the ones to beg our cleric to rezz them.  Now our<br/>
&gt; cleric soon realized the pattern only after I had the<br/>
&gt; gumption to mention it to him after I got a rezz from<br/>
&gt; him, luckily he was only one zone over from where I had<br/>
&gt; died and he was getting ready to log for the night so I<br/>
&gt; managed to catch him when he wasn&#39;t busy.  Once I showed<br/>
&gt; him the pattern he learned to not drop everything he was<br/>
&gt; doing to rezz the poor soul and also checked to see if<br/>
&gt; there was a cleric nearby before he even went to rezz<br/>
&gt; the peep.  Unfortunately he got  one request too many<br/>
&gt; when he was working on his Epic and he got fed up and<br/>
&gt; left guild.  But the few of us who didn&#39;t bother him<br/>
&gt; constantly if he was not busy he will still do teh rez<br/>
&gt; for  us IF and only If we were not able to find one on<br/>
&gt; our own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the rezzes really are  more of a priviledge than a<br/>
&gt; right in the game. At least that is the way I see it.  I<br/>
&gt; pretty much solo a lot onmy own atm when i am really not<br/>
&gt; wanting to hurry up and level.  this helps me learn the<br/>
&gt; zone I am in a little better and  I rarely ask for a<br/>
&gt; rezz unless I have lost a level or I am very close to<br/>
&gt; ding.  And if I must go to the guild for a rezz i make<br/>
&gt; sure I have exhausted all the other avenues before going<br/>
&gt; to teh guild to see if any of our rezzers are on.  Hell<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve even settled for a 35% on more occasion than I can<br/>
&gt; count  if that was the best i could get and was quite<br/>
&gt; happy with it. And i always make sure that I offer a<br/>
&gt; donation whether I have said I would donate or not.<br/>
&gt; Most times when I do get teh rezz I have had the<br/>
&gt; donation rejected only because I made the effort to fork<br/>
&gt; over the pp.<br/>
