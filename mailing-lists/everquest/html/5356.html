<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690137987">There is a spot in Plane of Tranquility, near a cliff overlooking the water<br/>
that might be nice for a wedding. Too bad the zone has a level restriction.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t have a problem with weddings, but I agree that<br/>
&gt; they should be held in out-of-the-way zones, or in<br/>
&gt; another channel. If I was in that zone, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to watch the wedding spam in /ooc, and I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to turn that channel off in case something<br/>
&gt; pertaining to the game is being said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I attended a wedding at the top of the SS tower once.<br/>
&gt; It was very nice, pretty area with all the dragons<br/>
&gt; around, and we weren&#39;t bothering anyone. ;)<br/>
