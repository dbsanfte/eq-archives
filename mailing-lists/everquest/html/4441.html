&gt; available to me. I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ack... routing through a workstation is pretty demanding.<br/>
many don&#39;t believe this, but it is.<br/>
<br/>
also 3D sounds hits performance pretty much. i still<br/>
wonder why they have those sound processors on a sound<br/>
card. i read an article about the new terratec card; the<br/>
bottom line is: cool card, but the _OLD_ drivers decrease<br/>
the overall system performance.<br/>
<br/>
it looks like many companies share a common problem: new<br/>
hardware is developed much faster than they can write the<br/>
software for them.<br/>
