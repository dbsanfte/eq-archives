<div id="ygrps-yiv-76807261">If some of your spells are indeed there, your best hope is simply run like<br/>
hell and trust Kunark aggro to do its thing. SOW would be a good idea,<br/>
beyond that, just keep going no matter how many and with enough distance<br/>
they&#39;ll forget about you. If you&#39;ve got a decent amount of PP, you&#39;ll be<br/>
better off buying some of your spells in the baz, if you&#39;re poor or<br/>
adventurous, they drop in Skyfire and OS.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] MY Enchanter<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Well my ENC is only lvl 50.... it&#39;s mana is 2.4k. But i didn&#39;t buy<br/>
&gt; equip to focus on HP (as an Enchanter) but i can&#39;t find where to buy<br/>
&gt; the spells over lvl 50.... I thought it would be in Firiona Vie but<br/>
&gt; there were no NPCs there =P. I think someone said it is over in the<br/>
&gt; corner to the east side but i died trying to get there because the<br/>
&gt; spider human things... lol they see invis at random then one attacked<br/>
&gt; and they all cames. But luckily due to being a 6 years vete i used the<br/>
&gt; Expedient Recovery vete AA. so i lived. But i would love to chat in<br/>
&gt; the chat room over the subject, i will be on Tuesday 28th of june<br/>
&gt; (today) in the chat room at 5:00 Mountain Time.<br/>
