 </span></blockquote>There are several good areas to try.  I&#39;ve been to Dalnir in the <br/>
Warsliks Woods, the Mines of Nurga in the Frontier Mountains and Sol <br/>
A in Lavastorm.  All of these are boosted experience areas, usually <br/>
+13%.  So you get an extra boost.  Groups are hit or miss as these <br/>
places are under-utilized since Velious.  I went from 30 to 34 in the <br/>
Overthere in 3 days, and there&#39;s plenty of groups.<br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;re a permium member on Allakazam&#39;s site you can tailor a <br/>
seach for just +wis items for Druids.  I find it&#39;s a great help.  But <br/>
a Druid friend of mine says he really see&#39;s no point in upgrading <br/>
armor, since after 30 you&#39;re mainly a caster and kiter!<br/>

Good hunting<br/>
