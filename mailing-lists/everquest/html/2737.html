<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738449423">I really like to find the lvl 1s who just logged in and don&#39;t know where<br/>
their guild is. I will take them to their guild, introduce them to their<br/>
guildmaster and maybe give them some patchwork armor. I have been known to<br/>
give tours of Kelethin to new players or visitors to the area. And I&#39;m<br/>
always more than happy to give peole details to quests so they can make xp.<br/>
:-)<br/>
Speaking of quests, I just finished my 3rd shawl queast (in Thurg) and am<br/>
starting on the 4th. :-)<br/>
Gonna go play that now. :-)<br/>
luv,<br/>
