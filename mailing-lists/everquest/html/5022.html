&gt; One problem with the war is it can screw up the zone until the server<br/>
&gt; is reset.  They have patched it but it still breaks, though less<br/>
&gt; often.  But it is fun!<br/>
<br/>
Still breaks?  Not that I&#39;ve seen on mine.  I can get any mob to take over<br/>
the zone anytime i want, just takes time to get them to attack.  There will<br/>
be times that the wrong mob attacks, you just have to kill the attacking<br/>
force and go back to hitting the named to get the right ones to attack.<br/>
Btw, one secret would be just hit the grimlings if you want either bears or<br/>
wolves.  Most everyone knows how to get the bears to take over, its just<br/>
most get lost trying to get the wolves to win.  The trick is once the bears<br/>
take over, just keep hitting the screechmaw at the chiefs hut and the wolves<br/>
will attack the north, then keep hitting him till the wolves attack the<br/>
south..then you have wolf only zone.  One down side is the bears attacking<br/>
the wolves once they lose their home, has happened before.  Just have to try<br/>
to make it close to the wolves cave and kill the 5 attacking bears...and<br/>
make sure you count.  Miss one and the bears will win if the wolves already<br/>
have the north cave.  As for the grimlings...you have to hit the wolves then<br/>
the bears in that order. </span></blockquote></div>
