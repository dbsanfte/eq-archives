<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683338068">Woot! Well I don&#39;t know about you but the sex thing is definitely more<br/>
important than EQ! ;) Watching animated characters bump into each other<br/>
just doesn&#39;t do it for me. :)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good way to put it, I may think about trying that angle, (not<br/>
the sex but the closer together part!), I know she would really enjoy<br/>
playing once she got started.<br/>
<br/>
I usually play on Solsek Ro but I might do the server change option.<br/>
There is another player that won&#39;t leave me alone even after I&#39;ve asked<br/>
him several times and petitioned. I don&#39;t play EQ to &quot;hook up&quot; I play to<br/>
have fun and do my little quests. <br/>

DENVER ROCKS =D  (gee,  can you tell I am from Denver??)  What server do<br/>
you play on?? I am on Vazaelle  Look up either Katashaka (45 Shaman) or<br/>
Gwenevieve (20 cleric) both are in The Claws of Night guild =D   It<br/>
would be cool if you can get your wife to play....  That&#39;s what my BF<br/>
did with me...  brought us closer together,  & is also the best birth<br/>
control ever invented (who needs sex when you have everquest??)<br/>
