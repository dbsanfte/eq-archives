<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214693922"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; the ends and out about power lvling is simple. get temp from a<br/>
&gt; cleric, get a druid. druid casts regn, str, damage shield, sow. goto<br/>
&gt; field of bone hit mob once move on, kill anything that walks away.<br/>
&gt; make sure druid is healing you. lvl 12 goto kurns tower ( off field<br/>
&gt; of bone ). kill in kurns tower to lvl 20 or intill something looks<br/>
&gt; green or light blue. goto paludal caverns lvl there the same way hit<br/>
&gt; mob once and move on. work your way to back tunnels and kill<br/>
&gt; shrinkens once there light  blue take the camps at zone in. from Here<br/>
&gt; you should be well on your way and zone choice can be done by you or<br/>
&gt; the druid.  Paw is mine it is getting nerfed soon.  I can lvl there<br/>
&gt; till late 35 or so. You could also goto into Crystal Caverns at 30<br/>
&gt; for power lvling. Usualy by the time iam lvl 40 the druid is sick of<br/>
&gt; lvling me and i solo dawn shroud peak has zelnicks thay are cake for<br/>
&gt; a power lvled twinked player least it hasnt failed me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; for you who say spells spells spells. have powerlvled warrior, monk,<br/>
&gt; cleric, enchanter, rogue, all to lvl 40. then soloed 40-50 and my<br/>
&gt; skills where maxed from soloing. the coin you get plus the 5 points<br/>
&gt; each lvl you can easly bring skills up spells to comp you at lvl 40<br/>
&gt; to get by. each class has a main spell class bring it and evocation<br/>
&gt; up.  and the rest come in short order. I have only seen one person<br/>
&gt; power lvled so hard he couldnt cast. But normaly you will work<br/>
&gt; something up it does take time. and your melee skills will be maxed,<br/>
&gt; if not close, my rogue i just started not only maxed pierceing but<br/>
&gt; 1hs as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You may not want or like power lvling how ever i see nothing wrong<br/>
&gt; with pling to 40 soloing to 50 before i begain my grouping career.<br/>
&gt; todayes game has drop gear cheap to make an old school 65 war on a 40<br/>
&gt; war. so grping with people at lvls below 55 are slaying the mobs. its<br/>
&gt; not like it was when the game came out, and grps realy did need<br/>
&gt; players below 55 to play well. even my rouge can tank still at 46.<br/>
&gt; dont sweat lvl 70 because you not going to get there in a day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Also learned that Tower of Frozen Shadow has a trap on the second floor that <br/>
people have reported using to get their defense up since its far enough to <br/>
avoid aggroing mobs and no roamers around it.  Its to the right as you get <br/>
there near the fallen bookcase with the skeletal hand sticking out.  As for <br/>
spell casting when you have some serious downtime just head to Plane of <br/>
Knowledge and cast whatever you need to get skill ups in on yourself.  PoK <br/>
has a magic shield that won&#39;t allow DD or DoT spells to actually land but <br/>
you will get skill ups in them.  Thats how my beastlord got his conjuration <br/>
up since I never used my DoTs till higher level.  Since I hadn&#39;t used them <br/>
at all in lower levels I could fizzle my entire mana pool just to get one <br/>
shot off.  Took a few hours in PoK (with help from a KEI) to get my skills <br/>
to the point they werent fizziling but 3-4 times before I got it, after that <br/>
I started to use them a lot more.  As for defense at lower levels I always <br/>
tanked the mob with my pet while soloing but at higher levels I had to back <br/>
off when I got to 50% to let pet finish the job.  Later after 50 I just had <br/>
to let the pet do all the tanking.  All that tanking at lower levels helped <br/>
with my friend I play regularly with.  Shes a chanter and yep, aggro central <br/>
on her.  She became known as the &quot;group sacrifice&quot; there for a while since <br/>
tanks had hard times getting them to ignore her after only 3 casts (tash, <br/>
slow, cripple, &quot;GET IT OFF THE CHANTER!&quot;) so I started firing my slows and <br/>
cripples on pulls and the mobs werent as mad at her when hers landed.  For <br/>
the most part, I would hold off PLing till at least after 10 since you can <br/>
die without penelty, after 10 I can see a quick PL till 30s or so, but by <br/>
then you better make sure you start working on the skills again.  Sometimes <br/>
though they can go up fast enough to be PLed and they stay close for your <br/>
level.  In the end its best to do some soling after a PL session to make <br/>
sure your skills are up to speed and you know what you need to do to stay <br/>
within your limits. :) <br/>
