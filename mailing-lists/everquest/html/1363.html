<div id="ygrps-yiv-353330279">Shamans can make a personal teleport potion to Field of Bone.  Finding a<br/>
shaman who could make one and sell it to you at a decent price might be a<br/>
chore though...<br/>

&gt; As far as I know, there&#39;s only the port to the Dreadlands.  I&#39;ve never been<br/>
&gt; there.  My husband went the other night and was scared to death.  He just<br/>
&gt; took off running and made it safely but how I don&#39;t know.  Just dumb luck.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s a 30 mage now, was 28 then and everything he passed was conning red to<br/>
&gt; him.  He said he will stick to the boats for a while.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Speaking of porting...how can I get a port to Kunark?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not Dreadlands...but closer to Cabilis<br/>
&gt; &gt; and without taking the barrel barge?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; is there anywhere else that will get me into Kunark besides one of the boats<br/>
&gt; &gt; or the DL port...please<br/>
