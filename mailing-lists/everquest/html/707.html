<div id="ygrps-yiv-342162597">AC and UO both suck ass. You should have tried ac last week during open<br/>
beta. I logged in and ran around for a while.. It seemed ok but all the<br/>
things I thought that were nice about it later on sucked<br/>
its annoying as hell plus the graphics suck, monster AI is sucky so you can<br/>
solo your whole way to the top without getting hurt for 1 point of damage<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m rather fed up with Verant! They&#39;re constantly nerfing everything<br/>
ingame<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s worth while, or ignoring classes that need to be balanced or<br/>
&gt; upgraded! So in retrospect, I&#39;m looking to find greener pastures<br/>
elsewhere.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps someone out there knows of another game (other than AC and UO) or<br/>
&gt; perhaps a group who&#39;s programming their own game similar to EQ? If so,<br/>
&gt; please don&#39;t hesistate to drop me a line or two via email. Tks in advance!<br/>
