<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Faction for Iksars: Currently Kaladim <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117351238">~~I&#39;m currently killing everything in Crushbone (or<br/>
will be when I make 15) for faction with Storm Guards<br/>
(dwarven guards in BB and Kaladim&#39;s warrior guild)<br/>
Then I&#39;ll start turning in the pads/belts for faction.<br/>
 I don&#39;t think this&#39;ll help with the merchants....any<br/>
help?~~<br/>
<br/>
I think you need to kill goblins in Butcherblock to<br/>
get better faction in Kaladim .. you can&#39;t turn in<br/>
belts or pads in Kaladim until you get better faction<br/>
with them.  I had a gnome necromancer who couldn&#39;t<br/>
sell in Kelethin and was KOS in Kaladim ~ she killed<br/>
orcs in CB until the elves would sell to her (snobby<br/>
wood elves!) and then went to BB and killed gobs until<br/>
she was no longer KOS in Kaladim.  Hope this helps ..<br/>
