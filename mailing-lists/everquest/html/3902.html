<div id="ygrps-yiv-148837206">It doesn&#39;t matter what email program you use. The majority of viruses <br/>
out there expliot the OS, NOT the mail program. They use Outlook <br/>
simply because it is one of the more widely used programs. The virus <br/>
will still work under most conditions. The only exceptions to these <br/>
are like linux, BeOS and other non-microsoft operating systems. Think <br/>
about it, if were to write a virus that is to infiltrate and do as <br/>
much damage as it could and your target(s) primarily use one type of <br/>
OS then you will taylor it to that OS in hopes that it gets there. My <br/>
wife switched to Eudora and was acting all smug thinking she was <br/>
immune to viruses and then she got nailed by one. I was quietly <br/>
giggling my butt off at her, she was ranting and raving and carrying <br/>
on how she shouldn&#39;t be getting any viruses. <br/>
<br/>
When it comes down to it there is no better protection than a virus <br/>
detection program! There are several programs out there and some that <br/>
are free. I suggest to purchase one, you get better support and <br/>
better DAT file updates. You can also go to my website and run a free <br/>
online virus check at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kosingigglephits.com">http://www.kosingigglephits.com</a> It&#39;s located on <br/>
