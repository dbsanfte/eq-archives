<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-85494737">I&#39;m really sad eq beta is over, it will stick with me for a long time.<br/>
Especially the end.. except.. I didn&#39;t get to see much, i died seconds<br/>
before reaching the battlefield on karanas ( test server )<br/>
<br/>
But I did see many things.. odd and awsome<br/>
I watched a war rage on Fennin Ro in the Desert of Ro.<br/>
And the beginning of a war on the karanas.. saw a god of evil and one of<br/>
good.. and hundreds of bodies.. laid bare across the landscape.  And what I<br/>
saw last.. of most odd things.. was all of us having fun =)<br/>
<br/>
Daledor, Human-Bard, Fennin Ro..<br/>
<br/>
Living on in final</div>
