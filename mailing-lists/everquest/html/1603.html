out by Mu, when someone may have a personal vendetta against you and may<br/>
somehow find out your account username then call up Verant and claim that<br/>
you stole their account just to have your account banned.  A rudimentary<br/>
investigation would probably turn up who the original account owner was.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t think this type of investigation would protect against a<br/>
real &quot;hack&quot; of Verants systems.  If a completely unrelated third party<br/>
were to obtain username and passwords to accounts on Verants systems, I<br/>
would think it to be difficult for the owner of a compromised account to<br/>
prove that they didn&#39;t give out any account information.  It seems to have<br/>
been turned into a case of guilty until proven innocent.  Although this in<br/>
no way benefits the victim (owner of compromised account), Verant is a<br/>
business and businesses are in it to make money.  This probably seemed<br/>
like the most economical solution for them with little work on their end<br/>
and  &quot;should&quot; not have negative effects on the largest portion of the user<br/>
base.<br/>
