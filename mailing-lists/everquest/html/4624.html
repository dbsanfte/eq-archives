so your dd spells may not do as much damage (if they even get <br/>
through) but nevertheless, they have a lot lower HPs than the average <br/>
expansion mob of the similar levels. <br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a site out there that has XP bonus <br/>
percentages for several dungeons so you can check it if youre bored <br/>
with Solusek.</div>
