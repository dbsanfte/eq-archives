<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014183617">Ah, I was not aware of that fact that old accounts are actually not deleted. <br/>
I have always heard and read that old accounts are only left available for <br/>
six months, but perhaps they only say that so that people won&#39;t stop playing <br/>
the game, or to make more money when people do stop playing, by making them <br/>
believe that they have to buy the CDs all over again. Thanks for bringing <br/>
this to my attention though. :o)<br/>
