<div id="ygrps-yiv-616945756">Why doesn&#39;t my Wrist pouch and Belt pouch  go onto those <br/>
body locations?   Would I expect to carry my Ear Ring or wear it?<br/>
<br/>
At this point in my Players history, I&#39;m now running 3 characters <br/>
on Test and 2 on Veeshan.  I&#39;ve had multiple problems and I am <br/>
still trying to work those issues out.  Truth has been non-human <br/>
at other than Freeport doesn&#39;t Freeze.  <br/>
Any others still having this type of problem?<br/>
<br/>
My first, has aquired 2 large sacks and a backpack.  <br/>
Plenty of places to stash, but he&#39;s established and can afford <br/>
the items.  My others are still trying to break their 2nd level.<br/>
It seems hunting is only feesible way to get coin and advance.<br/>
<br/>
I would BUG them, but it seems well past Beta, this is <br/>
the acceptable norm.   My point here, if I&#39;m taking up vaulable<br/>
Hold spots and I can not stack containers ie Wrist pouch in my<br/>
large bag.   WHY purchase anything less?   I have not tried boxes, <br/>
please enlighten me.   None of mine are smithers yet and from<br/>
the look, making a box is not a simple task.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
