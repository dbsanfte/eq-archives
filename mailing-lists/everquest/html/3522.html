<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Here&#39;s a question for you to ponder.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Which is taller - barbarian or ogre?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
halfling or dwarf?&nbsp; Dark elf or wood elf?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">In the EQ scale of things, sizes don&#39;t change much 
among races.&nbsp; A barbarian woman is equally as tall as another barbarian 
woman, wood elves are as tall as other wood elves and so on.&nbsp; They only 
vary between races.&nbsp; Gnomes obviously being the shortest, but which is 
next? Halfling or dwarf?&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; I think someone who has a lot of 
time on their hands should do a scaled drawing of all the races, shortest to 
tallest just so you can get a size comparison.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If you try to put them in terms of measured height, 
where would they &quot;stand&quot; so to speak?&nbsp; I figure dark elves are between 5&#39; 
-5&#39;2&quot;, wood elves are between 5&#39;4&quot; and 5&#39;6&quot; and half elves are about 5&#39;8&quot;, 
humans 5&#39;10&quot;, Vah Shir about 6&#39;, barbarians about 6&#39;6&quot; - 6&#39;8&quot;, trolls about 7&#39;, 
and ogres standing the tallest at 8&#39; or 9&#39; tall.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that leaves 
a few out because I&#39;m not sure where they fit in.&nbsp; How would you measure 
them up?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, on a different topic, I&#39;ve been thinking 
about forming a guild lately, but I&#39;m not sure of the process how to go about 
doing so.&nbsp; Since I already have characters in 3 different guilds, I&#39;m 
thinking it would have to be on a completely different server that I&#39;ve never 
played on.&nbsp; Any suggestions on which server I should pick?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The guild would be called &lt;Epic Hunters&gt; and 
is pretty much as it sounds.&nbsp; A guild devoted to people who are trying to 
obtain their epic weapons/armor.&nbsp; This entails mostly high level characters 
- that means people that have been playing for awhile that know what they&#39;re 
doing in a group.&nbsp; However, since many high level characters also have low 
level alts used for mules or slaves, the guild would still be open to all 
races/classes/levels keepng in mind the main focus.&nbsp; The guild&#39;s not 
devoted toward pure roleplay, but toward friends helping other friends out, 
sharing their information, skills, treasures.&nbsp; The main focus on the guild 
would be the quests.&nbsp; It is encouraged to do as many quests as possible, 
and to work tradeskills as necessary to accomplish individual quests.&nbsp; I&#39;m 
sure the details would fill out in time, but would anyone have interest in such 
a guild?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So these are some questions and thoughts.&nbsp; I&#39;d 
like to hear others opinions/comments on this.</font></div>
