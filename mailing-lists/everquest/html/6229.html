<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127793680">Well, they don&#39;t make you dance in synch. The band leaders can make the musicians all flourish at the same time. I&#39;m not sure if a squad leader can make the dancers all do the same flourishes but they would have to be doing the same dances. Musicians can only play the song that the first musician started. Dancers can do whatever dance they want.<br/>

&gt;I sometimes miss that game.  I didn&#39;t think it was as bad as a lot of <br/>
&gt;people did.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I&#39;m impressed at how they got all of the dancers dancing in synchronization.<br/>
