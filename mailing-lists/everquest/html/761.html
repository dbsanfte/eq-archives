<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163081888">This is begging skill for you.<br/>
<br/>
At 150 skill I get :<br/>
<br/>
1 in 20 gain 1 silver<br/>
2 in 20 gain 1 copper<br/>
4 in 20 get attacked<br/>
13 in 20 nothing<br/>
<br/>
Completely and utterly useless, but something<br/>
to fill in time while meditating I guess<br/>
<br/>

Just for grins I decided to see what I could do with my begging skill<br/>
(I was already sitting practicing foraging and sense heading - why<br/>
not?).  For quite some time I bugged NPC&#39;s with absolutely no result<br/>
other than bringing my skill up to (4).  My husband, also curious as<br/>
to how quickly one could improve (and probably to not be outdone by a<br/>
girl in whatever ability) also played around with it tonight.  When<br/>
all of the sudden a guard, *not* the one he had targeted and was<br/>
&quot;begging&quot; from, came up and killed him.  We&#39;ve looked at the text log<br/>
and he didn&#39;t *do* anything to warrant this reaction, his faction is<br/>
excellent (in Kelethin).  Any ideas?  Can you irritate these folks to<br/>
the point that they&#39;d as soon kill you as give you a copper?  Or<br/>
should I report it as a bug?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
