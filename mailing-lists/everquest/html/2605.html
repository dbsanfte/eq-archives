<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. I 
am not a very good EQ player. I would consider myself ultra&nbsp;competent in 
group battles, but in other aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I have 
never gotten a character past level 40. My first character was an Erudite 
Enchanter by the name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to level 40 after 
two years or so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which was my friends 
character but I own it. I just started playing again after giving up on the game 
and playing DAOC. Eventually I gave up all MMORPGS deciding they were a waste of 
time. About a week ago, I decided to give EQ another chance and have decided 
that it has improved a great deal. I am now playing a Human Ranger who is level 
30. I really like the character. His buffs and damage spells are great. I guess 
I could use some help on how to be a good EQ player. I have been playing for 
about two years and I feel like I know absolutely nothing about the game. I have 
never belonged to a good guild or anything. I play on the Xegony server.
