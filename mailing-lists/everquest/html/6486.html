<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212500807">There is a stat at the bottom of my player stat window that says<br/>
Corruption.<br/>
<br/>
I assume that is updated when a character commits an offense against<br/>
his home town like attacking a member of one of their allies or, worse<br/>
still, attacking someone in his own city. Please correct me if I&#39;m<br/>
wrong about that.<br/>
<br/>
My corruption stat is 15. Is there a way to remove corruption?</div>
