&lt;&lt; Which class do you all think peaks the latest in the game in fun and <br/>
power? I&#39;m just interested to know what you think. Thanks for your time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you read power as damage then Wizards of course. If you read power as <br/>
versatility I would say Bards.<br/>
I would also say bards for the fun one too. Im only level 31 but I have had <br/>
the greatest time being a bard. I guess everyone just has to find that one <br/>
class that is perfect for them :)<br/>
