bone and pinged 2 levels in an hour of play. I now need to find my <br/>
way back to the POK book ( I have the loc) to sell and train (at 17th <br/>
I can have double weald but I must train to get it) then back I go <br/>
and rock the bonebags some more .. the payoff is not much but for <br/>
exps...wow and thanks<br/>
