&gt; forever to level.  What am I doing wrong (if anything).  Maybe it<br/>

&gt; on you profile pic that you are carrying a book. What is that book?<br/>
&gt; I already have a stein which brings my charisma up a lot. I just want<br/>
&gt; to play the game to it&#39;s full potential.  So far, I&#39;ve been having a<br/>
&gt; ball playing!  It&#39;s become an obsession..lol<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i will start with items first and levelling next.<br/>
<br/>
we mages need only CHA for buying/selling not for actual game play.<br/>
well, i believe so... even with CHA gear on, my pet never responded<br/>
to my advances ... :-)<br/>
<br/>
mages should go for MANA and INT items. actually i don&#39;t have much<br/>
special stuff myself. if you want to have a close look what i wear, just<br/>
follow the next link (you can also see the stats of the items there):<br/>

<br/>
the following statements are what _I_ think about the game or believe<br/>
how the game engine works... and i might be pretty wrong about some<br/>
of those thoughts!<br/>
<br/>
the items you need also depends how you play and which zone you are<br/>
trying to survive in. this isn&#39;t true for low to mid level, but it is more<br/>
and more importat at higher levels... but even with not so ueber gear like<br/>
what i am wearing, you can still have much fun: you just need the right<br/>
people to group with.<br/>
<br/>
at low to mid levels (up to 30-35) you should go for mana gear first, and<br/>
int gear second. after 30-35 you should improve int so you get over 200.<br/>
when you are over 200 int, go for mana items again, and keep the following<br/>
&quot;formula&quot; in mind: 1 point in int, is 4 (or 5) points of mana (after int 200<br/>
and level 50+).<br/>
<br/>
let&#39;s say you have a int+3 ring. you have to choice to obtain a int+5 or a<br/>
mana+30 ring, _i_ would do the following calculation: 3*5 = 15, 5*5 = 25.<br/>
so the winner would be the the +30 mana ring, because in total i would<br/>
have 5 more mana than with the new ring. _i_ feel pretty good with this,<br/>
but i don&#39;t know if this changes at 60+.<br/>
<br/>
but, with the above example: if the new ring, would also modify any other<br/>
stats, you should rethink the above &quot;formula&quot;: resistance items are very<br/>
important. i also like STA (and STR) items.<br/>
<br/>
about levelling: what game style do you prefer? mages are very strong<br/>
solo chars, but can also be a valuable addition to a group. what a mage<br/>
must know is, when to use which pet, if to use a pet at all. the dmg spells<br/>
a mage has aren&#39;t too bad either.<br/>
<br/>
actually i can&#39;t give you good advice where to go at your level, because<br/>
if i start a new char now, i powerlevel them to 20 with the help of quests<br/>
or my other chars (quest 1 to 10, druid 10 to 15, cleric 16 to 20). imho<br/>
the game really starts to make fun after you are 20, because you have<br/>
quite some gear (for melees) or spells (for casters) at those levels and you<br/>
can start to play and not only try to survive... :-)<br/>
<br/>
but the above method is only good if you have played EQ for some time.<br/>
<br/>
i would recommend, have a look at sites like allakhazam to see what<br/>
zones are availible for your level range and try to explore them. if you<br/>
don&#39;t like the zone, just don&#39;t try to stay there only because other say<br/>
it &quot;sooo cooool&quot; there; this is especially true, if someone of another<br/>
class recommends you a zone! for example: i could hunt with my<br/>
necro at the same place as with my druid, but when i got there with<br/>
my necro, she was 10 levels below the level of my druid! also some<br/>
spots are more suitable for soloing or grouping, but this also depends<br/>
on the level: some groups can get good exp in group at level 45 where<br/>
some solo at 55+ (and those 55+ also get good exp).<br/>
<br/>
another factor one should take care of: are there any faction hits!?!?<br/>
many don&#39;t care too much about old world zones now, because the<br/>
newer zones are much more friendly to the different races and offer<br/>
quite some different faction relations. but this also has to do with your<br/>
level, and what expansion you can play in.<br/>
<br/>
ok, it is time to stop now... :-)<br/>
<br/>
good luck<br/>
