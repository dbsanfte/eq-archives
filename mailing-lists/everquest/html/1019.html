Clan Spiritslammer isn&#39;t 
Uber!<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I&#39;ve 
seen some posts from people putting Clan Spiritslammer in the same Uber 
neighborhood as the Watchers, SR and LOH.<br><br>Well just to throw a dose of 
reality on all of you, here is a list why Clan Spiritslammer is NOT uber (all 
true).<br><br>1) Planning a Severilous raid 9/10s of the guild had to ask what 
zone he was in.<br><br>2) Getting a group of 6 together for Disco in Sebelis. 
Upon arrival, 4 of the 6 forgot their Seb keys at the bank. One of them forgot 
to camp his Seb key altogether.<br><br>3) At a Vox raid, our cleric had to heal 
his party from the pit while fending off bears and spiders.<br><br>4) One of our 
warriors asked and got irate at a shaman&#39;s pet when the pet wouldn&#39;t answer a 
request for a port.<br><br>5) A group of us asked a Necro&#39;s pet once for a 
corpse summons.<br><br>6) We constantly make the mistake of &quot;Well SR can do it 
with 1 group, how hard can it be?!&quot;<br><br>7) One of druids has fallen into the 
same pit trap in Howling Stones 9 times.<br><br>One of our warriors, after 
receiving a 10 minute lecture about being careful of where you walk in Sol A, 
promptly took a nose dive into the lava 30 seconds after zoning.<br><br>9) The 
same warrior then proceeded to take 15 more lava baths in Sol A.<br><br>10) We 
always forget we need to be in the same zone for corpse summoning.<br><br>11) 
The guides and GMs of Brell know all our names by heart because we manage to 
find every single terminal bug in any zone.<br><br>12) Our justification for 
doing Chardok zone when we were all in our late 40s was &quot;Well we can always just 
zone out&quot;.<br><br>13) Same for Sebelis.<br><br>14) Same for Howling 
Stones.<br><br>15) One of our druids was so worried about forgetting his Howling 
Stones key, he accidently destroyed.<br><br>16) We&#39;ve sold an SMR, a Dragoon 
Dirk, a Mith 2 Hander, a TBB, a Kunzar Cloak, a Mammoth Cloak, and an Evil Eye 
Bag (full at the time too) to various merchants all around Norrath.<br><br>17) 
Our druids (all of them) always have to ask &quot;Which evac is it for EJ?&quot;.<br><br>1 
In Sky we killed eachother off for corpse summoning and revives only to discover 
that there was no one for corpse summoning and revives left.<br><br>19) Our 
paladin (cough) looks like an Ewok in Kylong armor.<br><br>20) No single person 
in our guild quite knows the entire family tree... even after reading 
it.<br><br>21) We can do Fear in less then 3 hours, but can&#39;t get to any place 
in Velious in under 5.<br><br>22) To this day, when someone says &quot;Can we pull 
something?&quot; 3 people head out in different directions to pull.<br><br>23) 
Camping the AC in south ro, we were KSed by a 46th level solo mage (there were 5 
of us, most all 55th levelish, grouped).<br><br>24) When a particular druid of 
ours attempts to port us, it is truly a mystery if we will actually port 
somewhere, port to the desired location, or watch the druid gate there while we 
go no where.<br><br>25) While trying to port to Gfay once, we ported to 
Hate.<br><br>26) Most people power level their alts and lower level guildmembers 
by helping to kill a mob they are fighting on a consistant basis. We just train 
ours and go conveniently link dead.<br><br>27) We once petitioned that the Noble 
Dojorn in Sky dropped a Runed Totem Staff. We later found out that Thorondar 
gave the Noble Dojorn the staff so it would have a worse damage/delay.<br><br>2 
We constantly sell extra loot and then try to buy it back when we realize that 
we actually needed that item.<br><br>29) We can kill Trakanon, however most of 
our members have died to green cons while trying to cross most of the zones in 
Kunark and Velious.<br><br>30) One of the criteria for membership is &quot;What&#39;s the 
largest train you have ever pulled?&quot;. Well we want to be the best at something 
/shrug. (P.S. - Conanb still owns this record /rude).<br><br>31) One of our 
warriors was killed by the same Avocet 5 times.<br><br>32) One of our paladins 
(sniff) was killed by Dorn 7 times (each one a purposeful attack).<br><br>33) 
One of our druids tried to kite Grim Feather at 20th level.<br><br>34) One of 
our druids has said the word &quot;ow&quot; approximately 2000 times MORE then any other 
person.... ever.<br><br>35) One of our warriors and one of our mages were lost 
in Lake Rathe for over 2 hours trying to find the SK zone. They kept swimming 
around the zone.<br><br>36) Our 60th level shaman still can&#39;t find his way 
through everfrost to find Halas.<br><br>37) A raid newbie once asked me &quot;What&#39;s 
a death touch&quot; to which Cazic Thule replied &quot;KRUUNCH!&quot;.<br><br>3 One of our 
paladins (hurumph) once got a rez and ran off to rejoin the fight.....forgetting 
to loot his corpse.<br><br>39) One of our paladins (like we have more then 1) 
once got rezzed and proceeded to continue to pull Fear.... naked.<br><br>40) All 
of our clerics and druids have Sarnak Battle Shields but none of our melee 
do.<br><br>41) Cartumandua continually takes most of our phat lewt and just 
oggles it an hour out of every day.<br><br>42) One of our clerics continually 
complains about the crappy BP he has (he has a Trak BP).<br><br>43) We have one 
high level enchanter, and he is on heavy medication (he says it&#39;s for his 
back).<br><br>44) Our bard seems to go LD only when playing his levitate or EB 
song.<br><br>45) Our other enchanter goes LD anytime the word &quot;incoming&quot; is said 
in guild/group/say/ooc/shout.<br><br>46) Ruut (our troll SK) joined the guild 
because he heard we got phat lewt alot and thought we were all pretty skinny 
compared to him.<br><br>47) None of us day to day can decide what the hell 
faction we want in Velious, so we usually wind up at Karnors.<br><br>4 One a few 
occasions we&#39;ve told a guildmate we&#39;re camping the Hand (in Karnors) and they 
proceeded to go to Lguk.<br><br>49) One of our Necros paid 2K for a purchaseable 
spell.<br><br>50) One of our Necros spent 3 weeks researching a purchaseable 
spell.<br></span></font></div>
