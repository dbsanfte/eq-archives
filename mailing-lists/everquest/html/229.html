&lt;&lt;Everquest is best thing what i see in online gaming, from graphic to sound<br/>
and grup sistem but it still miss much things wich leaves too much place to<br/>
concurent products to enter. <br/>
<br/>
First it is hard to add new zones or monsters it request huge uploads (<br/>
this can be corrected with addon discs but it is another question), loading<br/>
of zones is realy messed up if you just exit one zone it takes soooo long<br/>
to reload it again it will be nice to have 2 zones in memory if you have<br/>
enough memory for this (i have 128 mb).<br/>
<br/>
it is concentrated on gruping but too hard for solo play for some classes<br/>
and i dont like to play necromancer or any pet holder, and gruping have<br/>
much flows wich need corection and additional balancing like higer lv mages<br/>
and wizards. <br/>
<br/>
Also there are too low gains from questing and one thing wich can add much<br/>
to game can be a god questing sistem where many diferent players must<br/>
cooperate to reach some target but for now it is only killing stronger MOB<br/>
and if you spend 5 hours to resolve quest and in end you dont know a right<br/>
word wich you hear on other side of continent you make all way back write a<br/>
right word on paper go back and say it only to get 1 rusty sword and 5<br/>
copper as a 12 lv caracter not to see any move on your experience bar it is<br/>
realy bad. i do it 3 times to 3 diferent quests and as i try hardest things<br/>
what i found and after this reward i lost wish to try again.<br/>
<br/>
to be thrue it will be nice to get experience also for trading skills and<br/>
give them more variants so a posibility to make all normal armours and<br/>
weapons. And it will be nice to have possibility to make a dragon leather<br/>
armour ( hint hint)<br/>
<br/>
It will be nice to have some chests wich thiefs can picklock.<br/>
<br/>
Fishing some other things then normal fishs, or other stramge things like<br/>
boots with a gen in bag with a surprise big fish wich will pull you in<br/>
water and cast summon pirana swarm on you eheheeh<br/>
<br/>
It will be nice to have a place where you can leave your goods to sell and<br/>
where you must pass evry now and then to collect all income or it is lost<br/>
put this place on some lost plane or limit sellers to some level range, i<br/>
wish to buy a totem stah and all mana gain equipment but as im from europe<br/>
and i play normaly when all servers are empty i cannot buy or sell nearly<br/>
anything. and i play on fenin ro wich is all time full. ( hmm maybe i will<br/>
move from rathe mountains not too much people know where this place is<br/>
eheheheh)<br/>
<br/>
It is great and wonderfull world but for now it is a little bit empty it<br/>
needs a soul, a movement a random orc attacks on kelethim, dark elf rampage<br/>
on freeport, dragon flying in sky in unknown direction, strange never seen<br/>
beast in dark wood to start legends. More inteligence in program to make<br/>
world looks more diferent so that finaly a camping is not more interesting.<br/>
It is not need for human intervence it can be done by program if you leave<br/>
a orc camp and in zone is many players then why not that orcs group and<br/>
start hunting around geting items from falen (eheheh at last some money so<br/>
bank will get some real signifikance). Other similar products will come<br/>
soon big bad MS is preparing to enter in game on big door ( i just read a<br/>
news on its site it will bring some interesting news) the other players are<br/>
also on front door for bringing something new soon everquest will not be<br/>
only game in 3d rpg town and if a game is not interesting enough when<br/>
others come in play ? .... ?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I like this game very very much and all this critics are only in hope<br/>
that it will give some ideas how to make it better and that i will be shure<br/>
to play it long long time as i enjoy it now. ( my english is not maxed jet<br/>
sorry)<br/>
