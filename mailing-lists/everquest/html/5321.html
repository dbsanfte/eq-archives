<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712280470">We have this kinder, gentler guild on Povar server called Royal Order <br/>
of Norrath (www.royalorderofnorrath.com) if you ever want to go to a <br/>
new server. We are sort of a training guild in many ways. We have a <br/>
relationship with a raiding guild for those in their high 50s+ that <br/>
want to do the hard core raids.<br/>

&gt;the officers.  I would like a supportive guild who do things <br/>
&gt;together on more than a rare occasion and do not mind a semi <br/>
&gt;newbie.  Even a small guild but who do things and are on more than <br/>
&gt;once a month.<br/>
