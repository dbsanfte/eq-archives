<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795145343">I am posting to tell Su that this is AGAIN my last post. I left this group <br/>
once before because of idiotic members who insisted on forcing their <br/>
opinions apon others, and I will not put up with it. I have better things to <br/>
do with my time then spend it with opinionated low lifes. Su, I&#39;m sorry for <br/>
everything, none of this goes to you, I know you tired, but there are just <br/>
too many morons to filter out of the group. To the rest of you, you will <br/>
never get anywhere in life with the attitudes you have. Only in a fantasy <br/>
game like EverQuest will you ever be something. But at some point you need <br/>
to grow up and face reality, and it&#39;s not going to be fun or easy when you <br/>
do. Do not bother replying to this post. Leave your fights and comments out <br/>
of Su&#39;s group and for once in your life respect her wishes and be <br/>
CONSIDERATE. If you forgot what that word means, get a dictionary. If you <br/>
MUST comment, e-mail me personally, but I most likely will just delete the <br/>
message. Like I said, I have better things to do. Good day.<br/>
