<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919458857"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; there are hints about the bandwidth EQ needs on the official EQ site,<br/>
&gt; but it is somewhat hard to find ... it is sort of information for ISPs<br/>
&gt; so they know how much traffic within an hour or so can occur playing<br/>
&gt; this game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, when I was connecting around 40k we could have 3 people on at the same<br/>
time and not have lag too badly.<br/>
but our phone lines here just suck so bad. We can barely hear over the phone<br/>
but the phone company keeps saying there&#39;s nothing wrong with our lines.<br/>
Not that I&#39;m bitter mind you. ;-)<br/>
