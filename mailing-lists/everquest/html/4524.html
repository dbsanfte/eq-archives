<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-718865488">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
When  I got the Shadows of Luclin expansion, my loading and zoning times<br/>
went from almost instant to just like yours. With a p4 1.2 ghz,  384 MB,<br/>
32mb geforce 2 and a 512k connection. =(<br/>
<br/>
Now i&#39;ve managed to get my zoning times down to less than 20 seconds =)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that you have got Shadows of luclin, as this caused everybody&#39;s<br/>
zoning times to go up when it first came out.  The main problem with SoL is<br/>
the RAM requirement, it really needs a minimum of 512MB to run smoothly, but<br/>
heck i&#39;m a full time student, I took the cheap option =)<br/>
<br/>
I switched off some of the new &#39;Lucin&#39; character graphics and my zoning and<br/>
loading times went right back down, I switched off just less than half of<br/>
the new models and now i have great performance without needing to add more<br/>
ram.<br/>
<br/>
(to switch off the models, on the Eq title screen, click options, keep<br/>
clicking &#39;ok&#39; until you get to the list of character models, then uncheck<br/>
some of the boxes, load up eq and see how it runs).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
<br/>
(Of course, this is assuming that you have SoL installed, if not then i hope<br/>
that someone else can help)<br/>
