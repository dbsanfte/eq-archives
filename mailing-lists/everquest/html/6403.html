<div><font face="Arial" size="2">That&#39;s actually a pretty good 
question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would try it out for novelty&#39;s sake, just to see 
if East commons tunnel would become the active hub again with people buying and 
selling, or just to see if the griffon spawns in EC again.&nbsp; But that would 
also mean they&#39;d have to change a lot of of the content, such as Temple of Cazic 
thule beng a mid 30&#39;s zone again (where my rogue went to level and get all his 
Ravenscale which was the bomb back in the day!).</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I started playing just after the release of Ruins 
of Kunark.&nbsp; There was no Luclin, there was no Velious, etc, so really EQ 
Classic in its purest sense would have to be the original content without any 
expansions, but yeah, I do consider everything prior to Planes of Power as old 
skool.&nbsp; Actually, I could see justusing Kunark and Velious as the only 
classic expansions.&nbsp; Get rid of Luclin, no vah shir and no beastlord class 
at all.&nbsp; I&#39;d definitely do it for novelty&#39;s sake.&nbsp; I&#39;d even consider 
bringing back my old guild just for the occasion.&nbsp; Maybe soon Hecate&#39;s 
Wrath will live again.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Hey Kids...Been gone awhile...been busy..<br><br>Anyway, in 
  talking to my old EQ chums and with what I read on the <br>websites, there 
  is/has been some talk about SOE making a &quot;classic&quot; <br>server.<br><br>Now the 
  &quot;classic&quot; server would be EQ prior to PoP, no adds or toys, <br>with the 
  exception of the stuff necessary. This would mean no PoK, no <br>Guild Lobby, 
  etc.<br><br>Knowing that many of you have been here since around Beta or just 
  after <br>and that most of you can honestly say &quot; I remember when... or Back 
  in <br>the Day we had to run from X t Y and it was 4 day run....&quot;; I am 
  <br>curious to know if any of you kids would use such a server, or have you 
  <br>all become stuck on how things are now that going back to the old way 
  <br>would kill the game for you?<br><br>As always, but now just plainly 
  nosey..<br><br>Greg<br><br><br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
