<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-150436139">Thank you for your assistance in this matter.  I just wanted to let <br/>
you all know I got it working again.  I have xp and Directx 9 but i <br/>
got the dx9 after i got installed the game too.  So I completely and <br/>
totally deleted every inch of eq.  That wasnt easy. But after I <br/>
reinstalled it it went right in and worked fine.  I have been playing <br/>
for the last few hours now lol.  Anyway thanks again.  <br/>
