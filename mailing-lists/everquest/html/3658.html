<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006292666">I&#39;ll be picking it up too. EQ Atlas is a good resource, however their<br/>
maps aren&#39;t the best IMHO. One, they need to be consistence and have one<br/>
map that they update off the other maps they have. Two, No cartoony<br/>
maps. It makes things a little too confusing; And three, Add a legend to<br/>
the maps and include a N S E W compass. I&#39;m not saying they suck, just<br/>
would like to see some improvements. Hopefully Verant&#39;s will be more<br/>
consistent. <br/>
<br/>
As for the dual monitor, It&#39;s easy, just have a second video card<br/>
installed and run EQ on one and your other info on the other. You may<br/>
have to tweak the settings a little but that shouldn&#39;t be hard to do.<br/>
The monitors can be mapped to do this. <br/>

I will probably buy the forthcoming atlas, once it is out. It will be <br/>
cheaper than printing up the rest of the maps I don&#39;t have, since I <br/>
have been only printing maps as I need them. Plus, we ran out of ink <br/>
and nobody in my household wants to be the one to spring for the new <br/>
ink. Probably because they know a large number of maps will be <br/>
printed as soon as the ink is loaded. ;)<br/>
<br/>
What I would really like is to have eq in a window, with a second <br/>
monitor to hold my data; maps, charts, lists, and recipes. I know <br/>
there is a hack to allow this, but I would prefer a sanctioned <br/>
window. Plus I don&#39;t have the horsepower on this system to carry such <br/>
a load. My game would suffer.<br/>
<br/>
Twenty bucks for the atlas sounds cheaper all round.<br/>
