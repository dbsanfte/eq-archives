<div id="ygrps-yiv-960118283">You know one thing I have found in EQ - there are a handful of self-proclaimed EQ gurus, and it kills their ego to hear someone disagree with them or be able to point out something that they may not have thought of, or realized themselves.  A lot of people like this can not handle someone disagreeing with them, and they simply don&#39;t want anything to do with that - maybe this was TC&#39;s problem, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is not to say that they are the majority - not at all!  And I agree with whomever said that the reason we join groups like this, is to learn more about the game!  I know that&#39;s why I have joined...along with the chance to just chat with other EQ-heads, LOL  :o)<br/>
<br/>
I saw nothing offensive, mean, or ill-natured in the dino/aggro posts whatsoever!  I simply saw everyone stating their own pro&#39;s and con&#39;s for them, flat out.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow...just thought I&#39;d put in my two cents worth on this, LOL.  I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend!!!<br/>
