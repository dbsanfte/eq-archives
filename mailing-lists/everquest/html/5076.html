<div>I&#39;m a level 41 Half Elf Druid.&nbsp; Like you, I have soloed most of my 
life.&nbsp; What I have found about LDoN is, true you have to group.&nbsp; But 
the organization is there, so that the groups constantly change.&nbsp; Most 
often I am asked to join by putting my LFG flag up.&nbsp; The adventures are 
short, 2 hrs and have a specific goal to obtain.&nbsp; The exp is great, 
typically half a level per adventure.&nbsp; We druids are popular for our regen 
buff and healing, and have counteract poison up if someone&#39;s gonna play with the 
crates.&nbsp; You can save yourself in time if your fast.&nbsp; Then, after 2 
hrs, you split the loot, typically 50 - 80 plat your share, and go back to 
soloing.&nbsp; I thought it was more for guilds as well, but have yet to see a 
group of all one guild.&nbsp; I am typically quiet (I type slow, hehe) but so 
much goes on so fast, that nobody seems to mind.</div>

  everything up<br>to this expansion, but am not convinced that it is 
  worthwhile. Sounds<br>very nice, but I have had two guilds I have been a part 
  of fade away,<br>and this sounds like something best suited to
