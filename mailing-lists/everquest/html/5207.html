<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-53829276">I have been camping Crystal Caverns for a few weeks. I usually pick<br/>
off orcs at the bottom, working the tunnel to town. It allows me to<br/>
get a few orcs, and find a safe place to med. On the whole, a good<br/>
camp, with very good cash returns.<br/>
<br/>
One problem has been claim-jumpers. As a halfling druid, I usually<br/>
hide between hunts. Since people can&#39;t see me some don&#39;t feel<br/>
compelled to recognize my camp. This has not been a frequent problem,<br/>
but I have noticed that not being visible is a challenge to the<br/>
legitimacy of my camp.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, I find there to be enough orcs to go around most of<br/>
the time. Still, to have someone complain that I am claim-jumping is a<br/>
bit anoying.<br/>
<br/>
Usually I just go bag some terrors until the interloper leaves. Or<br/>
gets killed. Some bite off a bit too much, I am ever so sad to say.<br/>
