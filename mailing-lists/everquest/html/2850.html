&gt; now. Every time he has entered North Qeynos, even in wolf form, Lieutenant<br/>
&gt; Dagarok has killed him. I will say that you would have to turn in a LOT of<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i did this quest very often with my ogre warrior. i did the quest so<br/>
often with her, that she can not only use the bank, but also train in<br/>
qeynos (i moved her as level four to qeynos; at 13 she could train there<br/>
for the first time). don&#39;t ask me how many fangs i turned in, but it<br/>
were real many. well, doing it with an ogre is extreme, but doable. but<br/>
don&#39;t try it as ogre shammy or sk (not sure about others), tillin really<br/>
has problems with not only races, but also with deities.<br/>
<br/>
on the other hand, with a &quot;normal&quot; char, you should also do the<br/>
moonstone quest:<br/>

<br/>
if you don&#39;t do this quest for the factions (well, both of them), the<br/>
exp of them should be good until 12, maybe up to 15. i didn&#39;t do it for<br/>
the exp, but only for faction.<br/>

ps: for the mages out there who are working on their epic quest:<br/>
     captain rottgrime can be done by a lvl 52 mage, with the help of<br/>
     a lvl 46 cleric ... well, and the help of a lvl 41 wizard as puller.<br/>
     no, it wasn&#39;t fun and very close, but no one died !<br/>
