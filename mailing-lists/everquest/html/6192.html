<b>Subject:</b> Coin Dropability <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-640622807">The whole question stemmed from a debate a friend and I had. He said <br/>
that coin was no-longer droppable. I knew that you couldnt drop coin <br/>
on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
But he said..insisted rather that you could no longer move plat around <br/>
between characters on the same account. I dont believe that for that <br/>
would be bad for those of us who farm for our play to aide the lower <br/>
toons on our accounts.<br/>
