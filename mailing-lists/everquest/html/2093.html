consider it evil.  I am one of the few lucky parents that like to play the<br/>
game with my family.  LOL in fact we have a family friday night.  My family<br/>
is big enough that we can have two groups.  Yet we enjoy it!<br/>

it did provide a funny mental picture.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah. My mom is pretty cool. My sister and bro play the game too. My mom<br/>
needs to level up her ranger and shaman some though. I need to help her with<br/>
it.<br/>
Mom does have a fat ass. She admits it. she weighs over 200lbs. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
mind when I point that out. :-) We tease eath other. People tell us we act<br/>
like sisters rather than mother/daughter.<br/>

&gt; Appreciate the response but I was hunting with others, no one I know<br/>
&gt; personally, and when I died I figured to just go back, but when I got back<br/>
&gt; my corspe was gone.  I had 2 orc centurions on me and none of  them helped<br/>
&gt; at that point,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I learnt a good lesson, don&#39;t go with others if you can&#39;t handle the<br/>
&gt; stuff yourself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>

&gt;   If you die at levels below 5 you should resurrect with five days of<br/>
&gt;   food and water. If your corpse had nothing on it, it may have<br/>
&gt;   disappeared, but your own anwswer is most likely. You misplaced your<br/>
&gt;   corpse. Dying at levels below five is set to be low-penalty (you lose<br/>
&gt;   very little and get food and water when you come back) to make the<br/>
&gt;   early learning a bit easier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   There are tools to find corpses, sold by merchants. However, it is<br/>
&gt;   best to learn to die with finding your corpse in mind. Try to look<br/>
&gt;   around at landmarks when death is clearly coming. Try to be near some<br/>
&gt;   object you can find easily when you come back. And unless you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   mind having to do this often, learn to fight in such a way as to<br/>
&gt;   seldom die. Some gamers like to take the risks leading to frequent<br/>
&gt;   deaths, but I prefer to hunt with care and die seldom. Seems more in<br/>
&gt;   the spirit of the game to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Good hunting to you.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th level Druid in the<br/>
&gt;   city of Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, with others, I got<br/>
&gt;   killed by an Orc Centurian and when I returned to get my corpse,<br/>
&gt;   nothing was there.  It was not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my corpse?<br/>
&gt;   The book says no but I beg to differ.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Is it possible that I had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I<br/>
&gt;   went back with a dead body I died again?  Which meant I found the<br/>
&gt;   wrong corpse?<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have<br/>
&gt;   no food, no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I beg or do I start another char?<br/>
&gt;   &gt; This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to learn which<br/>
&gt;   way to go all the time and dying, it is starting to get to me,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since<br/>
&gt;   the Chat from the game options was USELESS.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>
