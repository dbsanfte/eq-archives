<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297556255">I am still hunting South Karana. Mostly solo Tesh Mas Gnolls and <br/>
Aviaks that wander around the hermit&#39;s house. Once in a while I find <br/>
an item through my research I can go for. Just got my Testament of <br/>
Vainer (sp?) and am considering the Qeynos badge series. Stats aren&#39;t <br/>
bad and doesn&#39;t look too time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
I am spending time looking over various web sites to select new <br/>
prospective pieces of equipment to hunt for or do quests for. <br/>
Leveling a bit over time. So many fine pieces will have to wait. Yet <br/>
there are many good items I can aquire in my 30&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The research is, for me, part of the game. A challenge, finding <br/>
something I can go for. I am most thankful for the many great sites I <br/>
can use in my research.<br/>
