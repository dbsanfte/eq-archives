<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993023820">I&#39;m lucky that I&#39;ve never been in a group where they felt that the healers<br/>
weren&#39;t entitled to the loot. But then when I run out of mana and I know my<br/>
peope need help fast and that medding won&#39;t help fast enough I get up and<br/>
start beating the crap out of things. (I like to make my 1HB go up).<br/>
Sometimes if I&#39;m full mana, nobody is getting seriously hurt, and I know the<br/>
targets will resist my spells, I just get up and beat on them.<br/>
I&#39;m lvl 25 and I still barely have 100pp to my name. Lvl 24 spells were<br/>
about 15pp each (from Rivervale-- and I&#39;m a High Elf). At 24 I think the<br/>
only essential spells to get are Greater Healing and Dismiss Undead. Symbol<br/>
of Ryltan might help if you can afford the Bloodstones to keep using up.<br/>
Bravery seems to be outdone by some other shaman or other class spells but<br/>
if you are the only buffer it&#39;s still useful.<br/>
Not sure if Counteract Poison does anything better than Cure Poison...<br/>
As for the various incarnations of the Fear spells at lvl 24, I haven&#39;t<br/>
bothered with them. I generally don&#39;t want to make things run away from me.<br/>
And if they are high enough lvl for me to want them to run away then they<br/>
will probably resist the spell anyways.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems<br/>

&gt; care<br/>
&gt; &gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>
&gt; &gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>
&gt; &gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of<br/>

&gt; &gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; expensive<br/>
&gt; &gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>only<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
&gt; &gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just wondering.<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; &gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>
&gt; &gt; people cooperate.<br/>
