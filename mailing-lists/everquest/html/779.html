<div id="ygrps-yiv-133327764">I suggest that if you don&#39;t want to be asked for clarity every 2 to 60 seconds, go role, and show your guild, and share your power with your group.  If you ask for a group in a zone, go ahead and say Enchanter seeking group to hunt with and cast clarity on.  Get&#39;s em every time =)<br/>
<br/>
Just look forward to the days when you will be able to solo 6 spectres at a time.  Whew that&#39;s a rush.<br/>

<br/>
  I agree that the list has died, but anyways I got a question for all you<br/>
  enchanters out there...<br/>
  I am halfway into 28, would have hit 29 but I am cautious and I like to play<br/>
  around (all guards except highpass hate my 24 illusions... hehe).... How<br/>
  often do people ask you for clarity? and how hard would it be to get a group<br/>
  after achieving 29? and last.... do you recommend going /anon or /role?<br/>
  Thanks in advance...<br/>
