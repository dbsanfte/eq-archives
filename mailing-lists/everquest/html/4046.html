pays off to be in the right place at the righ time ;0)<br/>

Kinda like when My SK had just reached  lvl 50 and  a bunch of my <br/>
guild decided to go to Velks and camp the tents and there was an SK <br/>
only weapon that was no drop in the hole there and I happened to be <br/>
the only SK in the whole zone <br/>

&gt; Sorry I&#39;m so late responding. I&#39;m waaaaay behind on my email.<br/>
&gt; I was actually there bc I was called to ME to rez people. There <br/>
were mob<br/>
&gt; corpses at zone after I was done. I asked if anyone wanted corpses <br/>
at zone<br/>
&gt; and they said to go ahead and loot. So it was my lucky day. :-)<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t venture far into zone without a group either.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
