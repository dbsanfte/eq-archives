<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730653736">Fighting gnolls in highpass (the passageway not the building) is a good way<br/>
to go. You can pick up some cool stuff. Provided it&#39;s not over camped. If<br/>
you get in a good group around lvl 18 you can take orcs-- but be careful,<br/>
they gang up something nasty. I was actually fighting orcs when I was lvl<br/>
13-- with my wizard. She would DS the people in group and occassionally get<br/>
in a good AE spell to draw attention off the cleric. Heh, I took to calling<br/>
one of my spells &quot;Wizard Taunt&quot; bc it would always get the mobs after me. I<br/>
suicided alot of times to save the cleric. But at lvl 13 and 14 it wasn&#39;t<br/>
too much of an xp loss.<br/>
But Blackburrow is still a nice place to stay for awhile. Elite ledge is a<br/>
nice place to hunt.<br/>
