<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It is split into 2 sections, the Guild Lobby and 
the Guild Hall.&nbsp; You have to be in a guild to access the guild hall.&nbsp; 
The Guild Lobby is open to anyone.&nbsp; Int he guild lobby there are bulletin 
boards that when yuo click on them it brings up a &quot;Looking For Guild&quot; window 
where you can post and search through guilds.&nbsp; If you&#39;re looking for a 
guild it&#39;s a good tool.&nbsp; If you&#39;re in a guild searching for players, it&#39;s a 
good tool.&nbsp; the only drawback is that the posts expire after a week so you 
have to be dilligent to go back and repost if you haven&#39;t succeeded by 
then.&nbsp; I&#39;ve used the function several times with varying degrees of 
success.&nbsp; Unfortuantely, I&#39;ve also had to use the corpse summoners as 
well.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; but, they&#39;re amazingly convenient when you have no other 
options.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">In the guild Hall itself, there is every tool 
needed for tradeskills, kiln, pottery wheel, oven, etc.&nbsp; There is also a 
birdbath to apply or remove augments.&nbsp; There is a guild specific bank where 
players can deposit items for other guild members to use.&nbsp; And undoubtedly 
the coolest thing of all is the mana bath.&nbsp; When you sit in the mana bath, 
the timer on your buffs freeze.&nbsp; this is good if you&#39;re grouping for a 
guild raid and you dont want to lose your buffs while waiting.&nbsp; There are 
several doors in the guild hall that are inactive.&nbsp; This was planned into 
it for future use in case the developers want to add zones later.&nbsp; There is 
a translocate portal where you can buy a port stone and stand in the portal and 
you will be taken there.&nbsp; This is good for hard to get places like Plane of 
Sky.&nbsp; the one drawback is that you cannot bind inside the guild hall.&nbsp; 
That&#39;s done on purpose though for people that would gate right back to the mana 
pool.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, I think it&#39;s what makes the dragons of 
Norrath expansion worth getting.</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually the price is a bout 
  187pp 7gp fo the level 60= summons or at least that what my friend pays.&nbsp; 
  Have a question do you have to be part of a guild to use the guild hall or is 
  it open to everybocy?&nbsp; I fit is open to guild&nbsp; members only it makes 
  it harder for those who are not guild members to get thier coprses back.&nbsp;
