<div id="ygrps-yiv-306346623">This is the same thing that happened when Dungeons and Dragons frist<br/>
came out.  If you watched the program the lady saw the EQ game on the scren<br/>
and jumped to the conclusion that he killed himself playing the game.  If<br/>
you listened to the program as well you would find out the man had severe<br/>
mental illness and he struggled all his liffe with it.</div>
