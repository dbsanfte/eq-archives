<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745758082">has anyone noticed that the higher level you are, there <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sometimes even things that con blue can be hard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The game takes into account that you will probably be grouped at <br/>
higher levels.  But it can depend on class to.  I know that as a <br/>
Ranger (supposedly a soloable char), I will get my butt kicked by <br/>
casters that con blue to me, but I can take pretty much anything <br/>
that&#39;s melee that cons drk blue to me and some that con white.</div>
