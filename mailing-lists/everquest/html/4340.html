<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014051060">You should have been given a newbie weapon that you can use when you first<br/>
created your char. also if you go to the guy you turned in your tattered<br/>
note thingy to  you should also be able to at least put 1 of those training<br/>
points in hand 2 hand<br/>

&gt; Ok. I have a minor healing spell and a spell that raises hit points.<br/>
&gt; I have a shaman so I can&#39;t use my club. I tried to equip it with no<br/>
&gt; success. I have no money. No one wants to buy mushrooms (must be a<br/>
&gt; drug free town). I think that I need to somehow come up with some<br/>
&gt; money so that I can buy a scroll with a spell that can do damage. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t seem to be able to kill anything bare handed. I just keep<br/>
&gt; getting killed. Does anybody have any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I could delete the character, start over, maybe sell one or both of<br/>
&gt; my spell scrolls and buy an attack spell scroll. But do I really<br/>
&gt; need to? Is there still hope for my character?<br/>
