&gt; &gt; where to start...Do i just jump out there and start<br/>

&gt; &gt; my way back from wherever i leave??  i know i sound<br/>
&gt; Very early on (lvl 4 if memory serves) you get a spell<br/>
&gt; called Gate. Once you have that, you can always<br/>
&gt; teleport back to where you&#39;re bound. (the spot where<br/>
&gt; you go to when you die) If you&#39;re a Wood Elf, that<br/>
&gt; will be near Newbie Lift in Kelethin, if you travel to<br/>
&gt; Freeport try to get a bind near the Eastern Gate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing to watch for: Gate easts a LOT of mana at lower levels. It takes a<br/>
whole bubble from my level 14 druid.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; (pretty common request) Once you get your next round<br/>
&gt; of spells (again memory is foggy but I believe level<br/>
&gt; 9) you get a spell called Bind Affinity, which allows<br/>
&gt; you to change your bind point to wherever you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; standing. It&#39;s your best friend to keep from getting<br/>
&gt; lost, you can just wander at random and gate back to<br/>
&gt; safety whenever you need. Plus Gate is your panic<br/>
&gt; button, when you see MOBs you can&#39;t handle, you can<br/>
&gt; always run away a bit and gate. (preferably with snare<br/>
&gt; on them and SoW on you to buy a bit more time)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. You are foggy. Bind affinity comes at level 14. As does sow.<br/>
And it costs around 8pp.<br/>
My druid just dinged 14 and the spells were pretty expensive.<br/>
