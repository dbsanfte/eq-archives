<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120667184">What a great story.  It&#39;s refreshing to see there are still newbies <br/>
about.  Brings back memories of my younger days. /sniff<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been to Felwithe in a while, but every city has a person in <br/>
their guild area that gives out a quest for &quot;Newbie&quot; armor and <br/>
weapons.  Just hail everyone.  When you see something in brackets <br/>
that is the response you /say to them.  The right person will give <br/>
you a box, then you ask for patterns and they list the items you need <br/>
to collect.  Write it all down.  This is much better armor than I had <br/>
at that level!  It will sustain you until your 20&#39;s at least.<br/>
<br/>
And to go between Felwithe and Kelethin just follow the road.  It&#39;s <br/>
not too dangerous.  Just don&#39;t fall off of the platforms!<br/>
