<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822478360">Thanks Eric.. I had manage to wait until the webpage fully loaded.. <br/>
it shows a skull.gif and those 2 eq files are shown too..<br/>
<br/>
..but after trying several times (20x) to download those two files <br/>
with and without using download express/accelerator.. somehow they <br/>
would only reach 200k and stop.. any solution to that? Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
(my isp somehow has a funny firewall that limit ur traffic to 1 <br/>
line, so when downloading those patch using default eq program.. I <br/>
can only wait while waiting for one particular file (for instance <br/>
eqgame.exe) to finish and if it took too long then sometime, after <br/>
1mb my isp will disconnect.. but if I start up a website to boost <br/>
the speed, or ping the isp/patch.everquest.com to keep the <br/>
connection alive.. then the file that has been patching for awhile <br/>
will stop as it thinks I am doing something else.. sigh, so I either <br/>
had to finish d/l a 1mb file in 30min or I shall never have it <br/>
(using d/l express I can get 10mb in an hour, without using it.. <br/>
usually 1mb took 20min) *I shudders at the thought of pactching <br/>
nedaria.s3d that is 4mb big*</div>
