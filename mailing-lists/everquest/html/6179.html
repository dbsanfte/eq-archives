<div><font face="Arial" size="2">For duel wielders, think about it in terms of 
boxing.&nbsp; A boxer&#39;s primary hand is usually his quickest.&nbsp; He&#39;ll set 
his opponent up with some quick jabs, then come in with his secondary,for the 
finishing blow.&nbsp; Quick weapons up front, damaging weapons second.&nbsp; 
You&#39;re free to do whateer you like, of course, but when it comes to Piercing 
skill, you have no choice, the piercing weapon MUST be in Primary hand for 
Piercing to work.&nbsp; </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Ok, considering that I avent played EQ in ages, as I&#39;m sure 
  you all <br>know by now..lol..I have an odd question. Odd only because I am 
  <br>thinking about it and not being able to play...well...<br><br>I was going 
  through the &quot;EQ Journal&quot; of mine and came across the <br>inventory list. It 
  wasnt complete, but fairly accurate and almost <br>done for all 16 of my 
  toons. Now, I am the kind of user that gets <br>each toon their own armor, 
  weapons, etc...so at one time or another <br>I had 8 or 9 centi short swords, 
  etc. Occasionally...if a weapon was <br>too good and not no-drop and I couldnt 
  get another one, I&#39;d switch <br>them between toons that could use it ( thank 
  the gods for the shared <br>bank..lol)<br><br>Anyway, I was thinking about 
  weapons and their usage in particular. <br>Mainly, the correct way of giving 
  waepons to a Dual-Wielder( which <br>weapon goes in 
  primary/secondary....faster weapon or the more <br>damaging weapon.&nbsp; 
  Also, when learning a new skill (i.e piercing) <br>when your level 
  40..lol...does it matter which hand you have the <br>dagger in?<br><br>I have 
  heard many answers and many conflicted with each other..and <br>it was never 
  something I was clear on..considering my two &quot;mains&quot; <br>are a caster and 
  druid...lol...<br><br>As always..longwinded..and
