<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hi, I&#39;m an old EQ user, but i gave me account to a friend.  I played<br/>
&gt; DAOC for a little, but its boring and I want to get back to EQ.  The<br/>
&gt; problem is, my friend is still using the account and my cd-key.  Is<br/>
&gt; there any former players that don&#39;t need their cd-keys and they could<br/>
&gt; possible e-mail it to me? i would greatly appreciate it.  If<br/>
&gt; not....i&#39;ll have to buy the game...again.<br/>
