<div id="ygrps-yiv-606282072">Lol. I think my cats are probably the only thing that tear me away from EQ.<br/>
I have to feed them and stuff. Well, and my family, if I have to get<br/>
something for them or help them out.<br/>
And sleeping. But I sleep alot.<br/>
luv,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Very well spoken. It&#39;s true. Most people who get THAT<br/>
&gt; lost in EQ are the kind of people who would become<br/>
&gt; lost in something else, if they hadn&#39;t found EQ to<br/>
&gt; fill their time. I have a toddler and I make sure he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; taken care of, fed, played with and put to bed before<br/>
&gt; I dive into the world of Norrath :)<br/>
