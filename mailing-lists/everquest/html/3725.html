<div id="ygrps-yiv-231831293">Might&#39;ve been a glitch or lag.<br/>
I&#39;ve had creatures that conned indifferent to me when I was NOT invis<br/>
suddenly run up and attack me for no reason before. All sorts of weird<br/>
things happen sometimes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>to hail the spirit  then next tick, it&#39;s back on you.  I was actually just<br/>
sitting there,  WITh invis on,  when the shark attacked.  SO,  I&#39;m guessing<br/>
that they can see through regular invis,  but Invis vs animals they cannot<br/>
see through, although this makes no sense =D<br/>

talk to  the spirits without dropping invis and the sharks,etc will just go<br/>
right by...:&gt; ----- Original Message ----- From: Toni To:<br/>

enduring breath, and Bard invis...) Got through the first 3 spawns,  and got<br/>
attacked by a killer shark =/  so I have not gone back yet..  need to do it<br/>
soon.(another reason I have not gone back, is I have been playing my cleric<br/>
alot =D)<br/>
