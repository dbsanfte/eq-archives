<b>Subject:</b> Re: SV: [EverQuest] Verant&#39;s new security policy.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035194254">What is their policy in cases of harassment? Or in cases where harassment<br/>
leads to one player purposely pulling a train of high lvl mobs onto lower<br/>
lvl characters and getting them killed on purpose just to harass one of the<br/>
lower lvl characters in that area?<br/>
Is this high priority or low or what?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; If you look at the matter seriously you&#39;ll find 100k+<br/>
&gt; players on a day with only 10 average support staff<br/>
&gt; per server (includes guides, senior guides and GMs)<br/>
&gt; they do become overwhelmed at times.  Behind the<br/>
&gt; scenes they do a great job supporting the EQ community<br/>
&gt; as a whole.  The turn over rate for guides, the<br/>
&gt; mainstay of Verant&#39;s CS staff is rather high.  This<br/>
&gt; makes it difficult to have a smooth flowing CS<br/>
&gt; operation staff on a regular basis.  The rate is high<br/>
&gt; due to a few reasons:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. It&#39;s difficult for most to play and be a guide.<br/>
&gt; 2. Some can&#39;t handle the workload average 100-200<br/>
&gt; petitions a shift (depending on shift hours, time of<br/>
&gt; day,  etc.).<br/>
&gt; 3. Burn out<br/>
&gt; 4. Some just get tired of irate players =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They are constantly retraining new support staff and<br/>
&gt; attempt to provide the best possible assistance.   To<br/>
&gt; me it&#39;s amazing at all someone gets a petition<br/>
&gt; answered.   How many other games out there even<br/>
&gt; attempt to support 200k+ users with direct online<br/>
&gt; face-to-face access to a support staff on a 24hour<br/>
&gt; basis.   Hehe. Hey if you feel the system has a<br/>
&gt; problem join the CS staff and try and change the<br/>
&gt; system for the better.   I dare ya.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just FYI - To process a surname request:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Apprentice/Guide answers a petition and takes down<br/>
&gt; your information.<br/>
&gt; 2. Boots up your petition to a higher level and waits<br/>
&gt; in the queue till a Senior/GM can make the change.<br/>
&gt; GMs work on a 5 day on 2 day off schedule.  Senior<br/>
&gt; Guides are not always available.   They do have SWAT<br/>
&gt; GMs however a surname change would not fall under<br/>
&gt; emergency support.<br/>
&gt; 3. Your request also gets posted to a bulletin board<br/>
&gt; after the Guides shift to be handled as soon as<br/>
&gt; possible.<br/>
&gt; 4. Either a Senior Guide fulfilled a request from the<br/>
&gt; Board or you were lucky enough to have one online the<br/>
&gt; second time you petitioned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW. Problems like name changes. guides don&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt; ability to make the change, so its normal to not have<br/>
&gt; it acted upon immediately.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
