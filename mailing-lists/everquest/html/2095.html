<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334211765">I&#39;ve also found that if you have a rl relative who plays you can get them to<br/>
pass stuff from alt to alt. Or you can get a guildmember to help if you&#39;re<br/>
ina guild.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Just in case this is a serious question, I like to use some of the<br/>
&gt; rooms in Freeport as a twinking place. Some are on upper floors,<br/>
&gt; seldom visited. I usually only do this when there are not a lot of<br/>
&gt; people on, to reduce the probability of someone picking up my drop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I get my twinker and twinkie in the same place, make the drop, log<br/>
&gt; twinker off, log twinkie on, make the pick up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the most part I keep this in a rp mode by having twinkie and<br/>
&gt; twinker be cousins, one passing to the other such things as relatives<br/>
&gt; might to help each other out. No super-twinks. A bit of a push, but<br/>
&gt; it works for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My primary and first alt are from Rivervale, and I found a few good<br/>
&gt; twink spots there as well. However, one of them I moved to Freeport<br/>
&gt; and had bound there, so my higher level character visits him in<br/>
&gt; Freeport from time to time.<br/>
