<div><font face="Arial" size="2">the short answer - we&#39;re those crazy people you see 
in the park every sunday dressed up in armor and beating on each other with 
baseball bats wrapped in duct tape.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">the long answer - we are a world wide non-profit 
educational organization dedicated to the recreation of history pre-17th 
Century.&nbsp; We are NOT a Rennaissance group that puts on productions and 
shows for the entertainment of the general populace.&nbsp; We are a group of 
serious&nbsp; (and some not so serious) people who like to study history and 
recreate certain aspects of it as a very elaborate, very intricate hobby.&nbsp; 
People can interpret this in many different ways; some are purists and believe 
it should be recreated exactly as it was, some are not so pure and believe it 
should be recreated as it SHOULD have been (i.e. electricity and in door 
plumbing - thus the &quot;anachronism&quot;). Either way, we are mainly a group of friends 
who come together as a family on a regular basis to attend events held for 
various reasons.&nbsp; The principle of the SCA is that the entire known world 
is separated into kingdoms which is then broken down into varying lands.&nbsp; 
Each kingdom is ruled by a king, and so on down the hierarchy.&nbsp; We create 
&quot;life in the current Middle Ages&quot;.&nbsp; We have tournaments, we have wars, we 
have classes to teach you any aspect of history you want to know about, and we 
have fun.&nbsp; </font></div>
