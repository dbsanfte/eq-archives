<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102698852">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting ready to work on my Mage Focus Items specifically the Shovel Of Ponz and the Torch Of Alna. According to the info I have found, for the SoP I need to get a shovel off an alligator in Cazic Thule. However CT no longer has the gator there, they have been moved. My question is after the move to their new location do they still drop a shovel? <br/>
<br/>
The Torch of Alna requires a torch off of a Mage in Najena. I tried to find this mage but didn&#39;t have much luck. Has anyone done this? Also the info I have says the torch also drops off of an alligator? Is this true? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to clear up some confusion so I may get started on this personal quest. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
