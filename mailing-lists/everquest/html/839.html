<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527283243">Well, everyone.  My cleric is now 5, my wizard is 9 and in the Nobles of<br/>
the High Sky guild, and I started at mage that is now lvl 4.  Oh, and I<br/>
started a enchanter, but haven&#39;t worked on it, it is still lvl 1.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes from Kirsten<br/>

&quot;I am not afraid of death, because when I die.  The suffering will end,<br/>
there will be no more pain.  For after death, comes a new life with God<br/>
the Father in heaven.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Horses are the most magnificent animal, for they fly without wings and<br/>
conquer without sword.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Wizards and Clerics are by far the best class in EverQuest and we all<br/>
know that High Elves rule the world.&quot;<br/>
