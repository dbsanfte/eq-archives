<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085901032">I have a few computers that hook through the hub but I don&#39;t use any special software or anything. I don&#39;t really remember how I configured it. I just have it connect via the hub rather than this computer specifically since the modem has to be hooked to the hub.<br/>
I&#39;m woefully ignorant about networking.<br/>

Just form personal experience when I was using a hub and ICS for my 4 PCs to access the internet, I know that I could not log on to EQ without some problems.  Once I disabled ICS though EQ started working fine.<br/>
