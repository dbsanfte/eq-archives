<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243071848">Ha, last night I was admiring a ranger in blackened iron armour (was real <br/>
cute too) and he up and gave me a tunic and leggings.  Now, I&#39;m not one to <br/>
stand in front of a mirror primping, but I sure look good!  I need to add <br/>
something for strength though.  I have a studded collar and a cutthroat <br/>
insigna ring, but I need lots and lots of strength, any suggestions?  Why do <br/>
I need more strength you may ask, I need the weight capacity.  I only have 75 <br/>
naturally.  My armour takes up most of that and i no longer run while in run <br/>
mode-more like crawl.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, where can I get more of this blackened iron?<br/>
