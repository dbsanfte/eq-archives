  <div style="FONT:10pt arial;">By pretty much all accts the mage epic is one of 
  the hardest if not the hardest epic in the game.&nbsp; Recently it has been 
  made a small bit easier due to the fact that the plane of sky keys no longer 
  disapear when you jump off the island.&nbsp; But the actual epic is a spell, 
  which makes it the only epic you can take to a different server once you have 
  it, which is why I think Verant made it so hard.&nbsp; The spell is called 
  Summon Orb, which summones a 1H Blunt Item With Good Stats and 1 charge of 
  Summon Pet, which summons an Epic pet which is the best pet before LvL 61 
  after lvl 61 I use the Post 60 pets but the epic is still good for the stats a 
  back up pet when needed, and its good at clearing yard trash as well.&nbsp;

  <div style="FONT:10pt arial;">As for why it is so hard.&nbsp; Well the drops 
  mainly the worst ones are the crown from the 7th isle in the plane of air (The 
  crown&nbsp;can drop from anything on the 7th Island but it is the biggest pain 
  in the ass to get there took my guild 2 days and there is a chance that 
  nuthing on the island will drop a crown and the island has a 24 hour spawn 
  cycle)(We ended up camping up there for 4 days and got 4 crowns 1 first day, 0 
  the&nbsp;2nd, 1 the&nbsp;3rd and 2 on the 4th).&nbsp; The Pegasus 
  Feather&nbsp;cloak off&nbsp;of Quillimane (Worst mob in the game to find and 
  to get to spawn and the cloak is ultra rare) (But you can probably find a 
  person on your server willing to MQ it for about 6k) in South Karana.&nbsp; 
  The Earth Staff off magi in hate (3day spawn cycle on mini bosses and Rare 
  drop off of him), though I have heard with the hate revamp that the revanants 
  can drop it now as well.&nbsp; The water staff off of Phini in Kedge. (spawns 
  once every 11.4 hours and the Staff is Very rare drop off of him)&nbsp; The 
  torch off Neh ashir (Spawns of the Top&nbsp;Reaver Torch is a rare drop off of 
  him)&nbsp;&nbsp;in Com. &nbsp; There are other pain in the ass peices as well 
  the element of fire in Sol A takes forever to get, the pages in najena were 
  just about as bad.&nbsp; </div>
