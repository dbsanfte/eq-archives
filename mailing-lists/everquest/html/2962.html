<div id="ygrps-yiv-389011708">Yeah, it tells you how solid your connection is and what your ping rate is.<br/>
Ping is basically how long it takes for the computer to send a message back<br/>
and get a reply (at least that&#39;s how it was explained to me). The higher the<br/>
number for the ping, the worse your connection or speed. When the green bar<br/>
turns red, you are experiencing bad lag. You are basically not receiving<br/>
and/or sending information from/to the server in a timely fashion. So you<br/>
may disappear from other player&#39;s view or fall behind. Or get hit and not<br/>
know it.. That is one of the biggest drawbacks of the online game thing. Lag<br/>
and LD (link-death-- in which you get disconnected against your will).<br/>

That&#39;s the lagmeter.<br/>

  1.  In the game on the main screen on the middle right is a green bar<br/>
  with a number , a percentage, another percentage, and a second number<br/>
  (always changing), what is it? I couldn&#39;t find in the manual. </span></blockquote></div>
