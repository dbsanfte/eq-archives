My card was defective. Only 3dfx no longer honors warrenties since they sold<br/>
to NVidia. so I got a Hercules 3D Prophet II MX 64mb by NVidia. It&#39;s working<br/>
nicely now.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a voodoo3 3000?<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have spent hours in tech support trying to get this ressolved but kept<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting booted out to server select or desktop while waiting my turn and<br/>
&gt; &gt; losing my place in line..<br/>
&gt; &gt; My computer screen freezes up at random during eq. I took all of the<br/>
&gt; advice<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggested to remedy the situation. I even tested the card in another<br/>
&gt; &gt; computer and it had the same problem.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone else have a voodoo3 3000?<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
