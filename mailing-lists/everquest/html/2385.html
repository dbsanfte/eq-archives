<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677566254">IIRC, my sister told me that the trivial loot crap didn&#39;t go over well and<br/>
that it screwed some people from being able to do their epics so they<br/>
stopped it. So as far as I know, even greenies still drop the rare loot.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I have been researching some items I can hunt while foraging some<br/>
&gt; things needed for my epic, should I ever go for that pinacle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some things I wish to hunt are dropped by greenies. I was just<br/>
&gt; wondering if the rare drops still drop from greenies, or if the rumor<br/>
&gt; is true that, if you don&#39;t get experience you can&#39;t get a rare drop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone know the status of the rules on this subject?<br/>
