People don&#39;t listen because they don&#39;t want to listen, <br/>
plain and simple.  It is the biggest problem in raiding, <br/>
by far.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to get attention and keep attention is to <br/>
boot people from raids that don&#39;t listen.  Have a person <br/>
wandering off after repeated tells to stay in camp, TL <br/>
him/her out.  It&#39;s the easiest way to get their <br/>
attention.</div>
