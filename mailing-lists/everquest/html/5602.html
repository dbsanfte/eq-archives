i remember kill the noob stuff outside the cities to raise faction.  <br/>
You need to kill along the lines of 50,000 to get to dubiously.  Like <br/>
kill the orcs in EC to get into freeport but you will never be able <br/>
to get into north freeport because they are on a different faction <br/>
from the rest of the city.  I also think you cant get into rivervale <br/>

kos</div>
