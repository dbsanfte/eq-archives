<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107756502">Awesome!<br/>
I&#39;m on the Tribunal if you wanna go to that server. :-)<br/>
My main is Conwyn. I&#39;m an officer of The Spellbinders. If you dont&#39; see me<br/>
on you can ask some of my guildies. :-)<br/>
I won&#39;t be on until I get a new router and get a new computer set up as a<br/>
server though. Hopefully that will be sometime in the next couple weeks. I&#39;m<br/>
really hoping it&#39;s here before Tuesday the week after next.<br/>
