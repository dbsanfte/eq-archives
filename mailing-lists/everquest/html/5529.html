<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127910412">Whatever you do I seriously wouldn&#39;t suggest letting a friend use your<br/>
account.  While I was on westpac for 9 months I let my friend (who<br/>
introduced me into EQ) use my account since I wouldn&#39;t be able to play while<br/>
I was overseas in the gulf.  Well when I came back all my characters were<br/>
naked and all they had in their inventorys were trader&#39;s sacks.  Of course<br/>
they were in the bazaar.  All my gear on all my characters had been sold in<br/>
the bazaar and I had some really expensive stuff like a couple 30k horses.<br/>
Of course it was my fault giving him my account to use in the first place.<br/>
If you are worried about loosing all your gear then take my advice - never<br/>
give your account to your friends.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I am back in school and working full time so I don&#39;t have time for all my<br/>
hobbies.  I was thinking of canceling my EQ account for the semester and<br/>
picking it back up later.  I am only 2 semester from graduation (then I will<br/>
have a degree showing I can do what I have been doing for the past 8 years).<br/>
How long after you cancel your account will your stuff get erased?  I would<br/>
hate to start back up later and find all my loot was gone.  While paying for<br/>
the account would not break me I just hate the feeling that I am wasting<br/>
money that could be better spent on my RC racing hobby.  Sorry, won&#39;t give<br/>
up RC for EQ.  It gets me out of the house and with real people, and sadly<br/>
is the second most physical activity I engage in.<br/>
<br/>
I did have another idea.  Let a friend use the account and just tell him to<br/>
stay off Tunare where my guys are.  While not any cheaper it would help me<br/>
with the &quot;waste&quot; aspect.  What happens if he is in the game and I try and<br/>
log in for a quick game?  Will it give me an error, kick him out, suspend<br/>
the account, alert the Sony SWAT team?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Thanks for help with this in advance and for all the help I have<br/>
gotten previously.<br/>
