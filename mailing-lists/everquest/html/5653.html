<div>Greeting to all I am new Just joined this group &amp; I am having a HUGE problem:(( Can anyone help or make a suggestion?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am a Grandmaster in both Brewing &amp; Baking now. There seems to be some type of Tradeskill bug going around &amp; I wanted to know if you know anything about it? I am not able to go past 252 in skill? Not with my Grandmaster Corker/Spoon or Geerlock? At 252 it just stops &amp; it will not pass 252 I enclosed snapshots &amp; have also forwarded this to Everquest as well. I am also not able to get my Grandmaster Carry all bag from Gnome in Bazaar either. This is a real bummer &amp; EQ has known about this &amp; isn&#39;t doing much atm? Even with Enhanced Patch I am failing insainly still:(( &amp; Am not able to make anything in the Higher trivials passing 252 either.</div>
