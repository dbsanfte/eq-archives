<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793802399">I am looking for a strong active guild.  I thought I had found one.  <br/>
It had many players they were on all the time and helped out.  But <br/>
they have had many players leave the guild or leave the server, even <br/>
the officers.  I would like a supportive guild who do things <br/>
together on more than a rare occasion and do not mind a semi <br/>
newbie.  Even a small guild but who do things and are on more than <br/>
once a month.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
