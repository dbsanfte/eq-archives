<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741540093">Me and my friend were having a discussion the other night while he <br/>
was playing eq, he was talking to his eq wife, and i was messing <br/>
with him, and if brought up the questions of, are there really girls <br/>
that play eq, or are the all guys. Then he asked me, if there are <br/>
girls that play, are they cute? Just curious.</div>
