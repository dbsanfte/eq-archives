<div id="ygrps-yiv-346112696">Oh, I know. I kept emailing and calling and petitioning in game and got the<br/>
same old same old. They finally just told me they had no clue what was<br/>
wrong. I don&#39;t mind when they admit to not knowing. But I hate when they act<br/>
like I&#39;m too stupid to have tried all the stuff.<br/>
Like when my modem died and I called my ISP to ask how to get a new one (I<br/>
require a specific modem for satellite that I have to get from a specific<br/>
source). 2 hours of repeating myself and explaining things to a tech who<br/>
talked to me like I was stupid and I convinced her that my modem really<br/>
*was* broken. It can be soo annoying sometimes. I was half tempted to tell<br/>
her that I had worked tech support at the navy and that I wasn&#39;t an idiot so<br/>
I could tell when a modem was broken.<br/>
There must be something in the programming that is overloading dialup...<br/>
They really should fix it. It&#39;s unfair to the dialup customers. Telling<br/>
someone to get dsl is bs bc some people can&#39;t get it.<br/>
