<div id="ygrps-yiv-138197208">It seems to me that the only problem with twinking is that EQ has become a<br/>
game about killing, levelling, and looting.  If it were truly a roleplaying<br/>
game, this would not even be an issue.  If your main drive in the game is<br/>
to get the bigger and better item (whatever it may be), you will always<br/>
have low level players trying to be twinked and you will always have<br/>
jealous &quot;un-twinked&quot; players.  But when did the term &quot;roleplaying game&quot;<br/>
turn into &quot;hack and loot&quot;?<br/>
