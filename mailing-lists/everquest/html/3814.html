Well, the first part of this sentence is <br/>
laughable.......the second part is untrue.<br/>
<br/>
If you guild thinks of you as worthless (which you <br/>
stated earlier you can only get &quot;pity&quot; guild groups), <br/>
then it&#39;s time to find a new guild.  I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
being a part of a guild where you are appreciated for <br/>
your abilities.  <br/>
<br/>
Second, you don&#39;t have manaburn......and since manaburn <br/>
really isn&#39;t used much at all as a viable skill in <br/>
regular XP groups, this change will have zero impact on <br/>
your ability to get groups.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I practically have to beg to get any sort of a pickup <br/>

<br/>
So do a lot of people</div>
