<div id="ygrps-yiv-154605664">I have a sword that has Effect: Spirit Strike (Combat) in the description.<br/>
Below the details it says something about a cold wind and doing 81-91 points<br/>
of damage or soemthing like that.  My 11 Wood Elf Ranger tried it in combat<br/>
and it just kept doing 10+/- damage. Can only certain people take advantage<br/>
of the effect, is it random or do I need to activate it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
