<br/>
I&#39;ll try to take these one at a time. =)<br/>
<br/>
Sneak lets you sneak around a mob * warning if you pass in front of them you<br/>
will most likely be seen * its useful for a number of situations.  exp. If a<br/>
merchant will not sell to you.. sneak and move up behind them, then right<br/>
click as usual to start up a buying session.  Be sure to consider a mob in<br/>
both situations.. it should tell you they are indifferent, else otherwise<br/>
they can see you.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to backstab... Its not really necessary to attack from behind for you<br/>
gain no benefit without the skill.  Yet its good practice.  It&#39;s also easier<br/>
to know when a mob is mad at you so you can evade.  Remember when grouped<br/>
with others take full advantage of using Evade ( turn off attack and click<br/>
hide ) if successful the mob will turn away from you and you can continue<br/>
attacking =)<br/>
<br/>
Disable traps is a under used skill.  There are a number of traps through<br/>
out the game.   Yet most of them were rendered harmless..  (example.. the<br/>
swinging axe in sola  -  and the dropping stone in solb ) You can train it<br/>
anytime and anywhere by simply clicking on the skill button.  Yeah I know<br/>
that sounds dumb but that&#39;s how its done.<br/>
<br/>
Remember when your a rogue your hide and sneak buttons work differently from<br/>
other classes..  You can enable both of them and move around unseen by<br/>
nearly every mob in the game.  Comes in handy when pulling your friends<br/>
corpses from dangerous areas.  Or joining a group that&#39;s deep in a dungeon<br/>
undetected by the mobs that have respawn =)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a brand spankin&#39; new rogue and I have some questions.  I would<br/>
greatly appreciate any feedback.<br/>
<br/>
1)  How does &quot;sneak&quot; work exactly?  Can I sneak across someone&#39;s line of<br/>
sight?  What is the difference between &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; that comes later?<br/>
<br/>
2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.  Does it do me any good to<br/>
attack monsters from behind without the ability yet?  I have been making an<br/>
effort to do just that, but should I not even bother?<br/>
<br/>
3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot recall<br/>
having ever seen or heard of a trap in EQ.  Can anyone give an example of<br/>
where and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>
there is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>
<br/>
