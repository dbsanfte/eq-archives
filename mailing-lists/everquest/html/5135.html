<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1723075476270442511-01102003"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">I 
started playing EQ because a few of my good friends played it.&nbsp; So one day 
I asked them what is EQ?&nbsp; All they told me was its a game where you can go 
anywhere, do anything.&nbsp; I thought cool!&nbsp; So one day I went out with my 
friend (who was my room mate at the time) to watch him play EQ and the game 
looked boring.&nbsp; All he did was run around, buy things, and kill a few 
things here and there.&nbsp; Well as soon as we got a computer he installed EQ 
and so I thought why not give EQ a chance?&nbsp; So I played a little..then a 
little more..and alot more lol.&nbsp; On Fridays thru Sundays I would play 
around 4pm (when I got off work) and stay up until 7-8am playing, sleep for like 
6 hours or so and do it again.&nbsp; I&#39;ve played for about 2 years now and my 
highest lvl character is lvl 29.&nbsp; My character would be alot higher but due 
to my job (US Navy) I don&#39;t get to play as often as I&#39;d like.&nbsp; Ever since 
we left for westpac on March 3rd EQ is all I can think about.&nbsp; I brought 
with me the following EQ books:&nbsp; Ruins of Kunark, EQ Atlas, EQ Spellbook, 
Shadows of Luclin, EQ Players Guide and 2 smaller paperback versions of Ruins of 
Kunark and Shadows of Luclin.&nbsp; All I do in my spare time is think of what 
characters to make when I get back (middle of November-ish).&nbsp; My room mate 
(who doesn&#39;t play anymore) was kind enought to give me his 2 accounts so right 
now I have 3 accounts..I&#39;ll most likely sell one of them with a 65 Veteran 
Barbarian Warrior and keep the 60 Shamen account.&nbsp; When I get back I&#39;m 
gonna buy me a laptop so I can play my 2 accounts and P/L myself (and anyone 
else) with the Shamen heh heh.&nbsp; Needless to say I am a EQ addict.&nbsp; 
Once in a while I&#39;ll go out to the mall which is 5 minutes away, or hang out 
with my buddies but most of my time is spent in my room playing EQ.&nbsp; When 
we&#39;re in homeport at work I look up EQ websites.&nbsp; Pretty bad huh?&nbsp; 
I&#39;ve been playing a little Diablo II onboard to keep myself busy until I get 
back.&nbsp; When I get back I&#39;m gonna buy me a few cases of Red Bull and have a 
EQ marathon =)&nbsp; Happy Hunting!</font></span></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I find it would be very hard to determine the 
  &quot;ideal&quot; candidate becuase everyone has their own story.&nbsp; Some are unique, 
  some are not.&nbsp; Me, for example, I&#39;ve been on EverQuest over 2 years and I 
  also have two accounts.&nbsp; The difference is that I started EverQuest 
  BECAUSE of my job.&nbsp; Most of the people I worked with also played 
  EverQuest and it&#39;s all they ever talked about.&nbsp; I began playing EQ at a 
  time in my life when my job was all I had.&nbsp; No social life, no 
  nothing.&nbsp; Just Work and EQ.&nbsp; I slept very little and played up to 16 
  hours a day.&nbsp; Needless to say, I becamse very burned out, and I quit my 
  job.&nbsp; I moved and got a new job and put myself in a position where I had 
  a nice balance between EQ, social life, and work.&nbsp; I would have 
  considered myself an addict.&nbsp; EQ was all I thought about.&nbsp; I 
  couldn&#39;t wait to get home from work so I could play.&nbsp; But now, I&#39;ve been 
  able to refocus my attention on other things.&nbsp; Now I go to school full 
  time, work part time, and play EQ when I have no other social plans.&nbsp; 
  Even though I still play, it&#39;s no longer the first thing I think of when I&#39;m 
  bored and need something to do.&nbsp; I still love the game and I have no 
  intentions of quitting.&nbsp; Especially now that after 2 years my main 
  character is JUST NOW hitting level 50 and going to start working on his epic 
  and AA points.&nbsp; </font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">It&#39;s always interesting and entertaining for me 
  to hear other people&#39;s stories.&nbsp; Although I wouldn&#39;t mind appearing on 
  the VH-1 show, I wouldn&#39;t consider myself the &quot;ideal&quot; candidate since my 
  addiction days are over and I&#39;ve found a comfortable niche, but I think 
  whoever does get on the show is gonna have a great time.&nbsp; I know I did 
  when I went to San Francisco for the episode of Call For Help on Tech 
  TV.&nbsp; Good luck to anyone who&#39;s interested, and congrats to whomever they 
  choose - even if it&#39;s me.&nbsp; :) hehehe!</font></div>

    Everyone,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks for taking the time to read this post. 
    I&#39;m<br>&gt; working on a new <br>&gt; show for VH1 entitled &quot;My Obsession&quot; 
    It focuses on<br>&gt; pop-culture and <br>&gt; it&#39;s effects on society, 
    people, etc.&nbsp; We are<br>&gt; working on a segment <br>&gt; that 
    highlights people submerged in the world of<br>&gt; Everquest, and I&#39;m 
    <br>&gt; looking for possible candidates for the show.&nbsp; Our<br>&gt; 
    ideal person would <br>&gt; be someone who plays the game<br>&gt; 
    continuously/excessively and has <br>&gt; encountered problems be it family 
    or friends due to<br>&gt; their EQ habits.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Side note: This 
    is not meant to be an Everquest<br>&gt; &quot;bashing&quot;<br>&gt; story as so many 
    from the past have been.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt; <br>&gt;
