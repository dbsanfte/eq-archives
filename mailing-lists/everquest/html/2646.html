<b>Subject:</b> New video card <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-939596153">Two days ago I was playing EQ (what else?) when my monitor shut <br/>
itself off. After much exploration I found that my graphics card had <br/>
crapped out. I thought more trouble was afoot, when my computer <br/>
seemed to think it was a 256. After reloading a few drivers, I tested <br/>
the video card again. No video output.<br/>
<br/>
I was planning on a new card, anyway. We are limping along on the old <br/>
video out, and I started the disheartening search for a pci card of <br/>
some value.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine my elation when I found a gforce4 in pci format for $116!<br/>
<br/>
Lacking a free $116 right now, I am still limping. But more than I <br/>
dared hope for is available.<br/>
<br/>
On the down side, I learned just how much of an EQ junkie I am. I was <br/>
so depressed by the malfunction that I got drunk. I don&#39;t usually do <br/>
that. Drank a half pint of Gilby&#39;s vodka and watched dvd&#39;s for a <br/>
while. Then went to work on the &#39;puter, got it running again, and <br/>
started shopping.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to get the new card very soon. Should have my son buy it, as he <br/>
plays more than I do. His primary is over ten levels ahead of mine.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting, everyone.<br/>
