<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111811195">Thank you for the welcome and you are right in that I<br/>
am able to play and not feel as if I am neglecting<br/>
him.  He is able to play much more than I as he works<br/>
from home so his high level characters have others<br/>
that he hunts with and he saves his newer characters<br/>
to help me along.  Whodda thunk one could get so<br/>
hooked on our &quot;virtual&quot; lives (smiles)...I look<br/>
forward to learning from all of you and appreciate<br/>
having this list to go to...It answers questions I<br/>
didn&#39;t know to ask and also lets me see some things I<br/>
can look forward to <br/>

&gt; Sadly, I am on the Zeb server, so our hails will<br/>
&gt; have to be here. <br/>
&gt; This is a good list, and much fellowship and advice<br/>
&gt; shall be found <br/>
&gt; here. It is a little slow here right now, but has<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s busy periods.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a halfling druid as my primary. Lvl 30. I am<br/>
&gt; also a halfling <br/>
&gt; warrior, lvl 8, and a gnome magician, lvl 3. I have<br/>
&gt; worked my primary <br/>
&gt; most of the time, but now am attending a bit more to<br/>
&gt; my alts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to ask questions here. This is a great<br/>
&gt; place to share <br/>
&gt; adventures, get advice, and share what you have<br/>
&gt; learned.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am really new at the game (have been playing<br/>
&gt; only about a <br/>
&gt; &gt; month)...i am on the Ayonae Ro server with a<br/>
&gt; couple of characters <br/>
&gt; &gt; (lvl 9 Barb Warrior and lvl 5 Cleric...told you I<br/>
&gt; was new...LOL) <br/>
&gt; Was <br/>
&gt; &gt; just curious if anyone else in on that<br/>
&gt; server...usually am hunting <br/>
&gt; &gt; with the love of my life who is teaching me the<br/>
&gt; game but would be <br/>
&gt; fun <br/>
&gt; &gt; to pass a friendly &quot;Hail&quot; to those here on the<br/>
&gt; list should our <br/>
&gt; paths <br/>
&gt; &gt; cross...would that be proper and acceptable EQ<br/>
&gt; etiquette??  Just <br/>
&gt; &gt; curious  :-)<br/>
