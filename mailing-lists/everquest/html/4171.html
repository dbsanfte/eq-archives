<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well i picked up my new video 
card Sunday and it rocks.&nbsp; I did get the GeForce4 Ti4200 card.&nbsp; It has 
64 mb RAM.&nbsp; Even the box says it out performs the 128 version of the same 
card.&nbsp; The 128 meg Ti 4200 the ram funs at 444 MHrz and the 64 mb card runs 
at 500.&nbsp; The cool thing was it only cost me&nbsp; $184.&nbsp; well my game 
plays great now.&nbsp; I still get a little jerkiness on the Plane of knowledge, 
even though i have a 1.33 Ghrz with 412 mb RAm and a DSL connection and my clip 
rate is turned all the way down.&nbsp; Well See everyone 
later</font></div></html></div>
