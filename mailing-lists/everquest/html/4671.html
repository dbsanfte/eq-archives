<b>Subject:</b> Restoring a deleted character <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572627757">Please help if you can!<br/>
<br/>
My son has just accidentally deleted his best character, which he has <br/>
been working with for many months. Obviously he is most upset.<br/>
<br/>
Can the character be restored, and if so, what is the procedure?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in anticipation!</div>
