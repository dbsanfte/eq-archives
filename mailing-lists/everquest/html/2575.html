<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375109753">The combine weapons sold by gypsies are magic. About 35 to 45pp, if I <br/>
recall correctly. Often the velium weapons can be had for less.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that you will be able to hunt for magic weapon drops at <br/>
your level. You most probably will have to buy the weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Keep you eyes open, though. I got a velium morning star outside the <br/>
bank in Rivervale. Someone had just left it laying on the ground. You <br/>
never know what you might find.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have only been playing a month and I am wondering where do you <br/>
find magic<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons in this game...My two main characters are a 11th level <br/>
Barbarian<br/>
&gt; &gt; Warrior and a 9th level Half elf Bard.....any help would be <br/>
great....by the<br/>
&gt; &gt; way plz dont say buy it from other players...I dont have much in <br/>
PP&#39;s<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; actually it is cheaper to buy some weapons from other players,<br/>
&gt; especially after the game is somewhat &quot;old&quot;, in other words<br/>
&gt; there are so many high level people out there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; but you don&#39;t have to look at the things offered in EC, because<br/>
&gt; almost everything there sold is &quot;stylish&quot; or &quot;ueber&quot;. so IMHO the<br/>
&gt; prices there are so high because people are willing to pay high<br/>
&gt; prices to get one of those kinky new weapons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; when i was young i tried to get some magic pieces as well. (i<br/>
&gt; started with warrior chars as well - IMHO a good thing to do, to<br/>
&gt; learn the game mechanics) and i always wanted to hunt those nasty<br/>
&gt; skellies in tundra, but they could only be hit by magic weapons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; my dream weapon as this time were barbed whips and langseax swords.<br/>
&gt; because i couldn&#39;t afford them, i got tentacle whips from someone<br/>
&gt; for 20pp each. now those weapons are almost always destroyed when<br/>
&gt; looted because they don&#39;t even give good money at the merchants.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and the kunark, velious and luclin expansion gave so many new <br/>
weapons<br/>
&gt; that the old ones almost got unknown (better say ignored), on the <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; hand you can get magic weapons cheaper now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and now compare prices with those combine weapons sold in EC at the<br/>
&gt; shady. i think they are the only magic weapons you can buy from an<br/>
&gt; old world merchant (actually don&#39;t know of any other merchant). and<br/>
&gt; i think gypsie camps have merchants selling some weapons as well ...<br/>
&gt; i am not sure if those were magic ones ... oh the old days ... ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; if you play on Tarem Warr, we could arrange a meeting: i think i <br/>
still<br/>
&gt; have many things on my different chars, i don&#39;t really need.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; take care<br/>
