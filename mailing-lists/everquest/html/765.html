<div id="ygrps-yiv-214346110">A while ago, somewhere, I read a message from Verant concerning stats/attributes and their impact on gameplay, i.e what affects what.. It was about what STR did to fighting and what exactly AGI/DEX etc was good for.. If anyone remembers this message please tell me where I can find it or if you have it could you please email it to me?<br/>
