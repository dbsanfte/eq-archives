&gt; I have just joined a guild and am pretty excited. I<br/>
&gt; was thinking about forming my own but was not sure on<br/>
&gt; the total procedures. So, posing some questions to the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You need to recruit first. To get guild tag created, at least 10 people<br/>
must be online, at the same place, for a GM to count noses. He&#39;ll then<br/>
create the guild-tag, and make the guild-former the guild leader. The<br/>
guild leader then (can) invite in the other 10 people.<br/>
<br/>
Note that to KEEP a guild, 10 accounts(aka players) must be in it (not 8<br/>
characters!).<br/>

Guilds are a per server thing, so guild fubar on 1 server could have no<br/>
relation to guild fubar on a different server (though many of the large<br/>
guilds form themselves on all the servers)</div>
