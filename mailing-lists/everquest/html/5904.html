<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-979143868">Excellent points made by Haly,<br/>
<br/>
	I have a Ranger thats lvl 34 and she currently dual wields. Now this is <br/>
a choice that I made which seemed to &quot;fit&quot; my toon and her personality. <br/>
I also have a Warrior who just uses a 2hs weapon. I plan on building up <br/>
his skills in the other areas too but a 2hs seems to &quot;fit&quot; him the best. <br/>
It&#39;s all about how you want to play YOUR toon, there is no right or <br/>
wrong way. One thing you may want to consider is that some weapons carry <br/>
some cool abilities. such as a damage bonus or spell. This may be <br/>
something you might want to keep in mind and also in some situations you <br/>
can benefit from these added bonuses. You asked a very good question, a <br/>
basic one and really IMHO is something that alot of players really don&#39;t <br/>
think about. They are more interested in getting the uber twink gear <br/>
which is nice but if you can&#39;t use it to it&#39;s full potential and to your <br/>
advantage, it&#39;s really not that uber.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
