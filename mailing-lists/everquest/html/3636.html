<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Druids relative to Necros <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511703830">You need to remember Necro has the best pet in the<br/>
game and they are also the best solo class.<br/>
<br/>
They are designed to solo and even though druids are<br/>
to, I really think Druids are better in groups<br/>
<br/>
also Necro&#39;s can Life tap.<br/>
<br/>
It does not surpise me that a Necro 3 levels lower can<br/>
out solo you.<br/>
<br/>
here is an example.  I had a level 18 mage and my<br/>
friend was level 20 druid.  I can solo yellow Crag<br/>
Spiders in EK and his druid has trouble.  The water<br/>
pet is better against poisons and the pets can take<br/>
the beating while I cast DD&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
SO I think this is what you are experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

&gt; Only once have I <br/>
&gt; had to wait for the camp. That time I was following<br/>
&gt; a Necro, lvl 30. <br/>
&gt; Watched his kills. Much faster than mine. Curious as<br/>
&gt; to whether this <br/>
&gt; is normal.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps my technique is flakey. I ensnare,<br/>
&gt; ensnarring root, dot, dot, <br/>
&gt; and med. Have to often refresh the root at least<br/>
&gt; once. Then refresh <br/>
&gt; one dot. Dead brute. Not too fast, but affective.<br/>
&gt; This is on dark <br/>
&gt; blue brutes with me at lvl 33.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it goes well I come out down only one bubble of<br/>
&gt; mana. Usually at <br/>
&gt; least half. Only twice did I get low, and then I<br/>
&gt; just burned the rest <br/>
&gt; on nukes to finish the kill. Didn&#39;t want to waste<br/>
&gt; mana on roots that <br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t holding.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am working as a pure caster now, and this is my<br/>
&gt; highest level <br/>
&gt; character. I am unfamiliar with hybrids, but<br/>
&gt; watching a lower level <br/>
&gt; necro outpace my kills made me wonder if I could not<br/>
&gt; do better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any thoughts?<br/>
