<div id="ygrps-yiv-919252537">What store did you go to? I know that at Electronics Boutique(sp?)  should<br/>
have the new EQ Gold that has all the expansions up to and including PoP.<br/>
At least all the EB&#39;s in the malls here in Jax, Fl do.  I plan on getting it<br/>
for the account with my chanter and pally on it as soon as I don&#39;t have to<br/>
worry about  my bills leaving my paychecks near to empty after paying them,<br/>
which should be within the next couple of weeks.<br/>

&gt; Many thanks everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The local computer store only had Planes of Power in stock and not Shadows<br/>
&gt; of Lucin, so that sorta decided for me.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for all your thoughts though.  I also don&#39;t like to be dependant on<br/>
&gt; wizzies or druids for travel as I play in a different time zone than most<br/>
&gt; other people on my server so I tend to only have 3-20 people in a zone at<br/>
&gt; once.... hence I do quite a bit of soloing.....<br/>
