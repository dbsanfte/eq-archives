<p>That&#39;s cause you are safe..&nbsp; The odds of anyone hacking your system.. or anyone else&#39;s system just to get your everquest account is next to nothing.&nbsp; Sure it happens every now and then due to the lack of players realizing their personal responsibility to protect themselves on the Internet.&nbsp; If your handing your account information out to other players/not running uptodate anti-virus programs/personal firewalls/etc. then&nbsp;they have no one to blame but themselves.&nbsp; There&#39;s certainly more personal information about them that would be more important to&nbsp;&quot;hackers&quot; other then your Everquest account.&nbsp; Those protection programs are easy to install and maintain - most are automatic with the least amount of input from the end-user.&nbsp; If someone is &quot;sniffing&quot; the packets from your computer, you&#39;ve got a much larger problem then worrying if they have compromised your EQ account.</p>
