of them, they&#39;re pretty straitforward...but I do have a question bout<br/>
the cooking one. Why? I understand smithing...get ore, make bars, make<br/>
weapons/armour...I know in EQ, every so many time units, you<br/>
automaticlly eat food. Since rations and milk will fill this funcion,<br/>
 what is the purpose of cookin and brewing? Do you get more food value<br/>
out of something you&#39;ve made, as oppoised to the rations and bisquits?<br/>
Can you eat the food and get boosts from it? Same thing for the<br/>
brewing? Or is it just a vanity thing to be walking around with<br/>
something you cooked as opposed to the iron raions and milk thing...<br/>
<br/>
The short answer is that higher level baked goods (e.g. Misty Thicket<br/>
Picnics) and brewed items (e.g. Qeynos Afternoon Tea) boost stats<br/>
significantly when consumed. <br/>
<br/>
Trade skills get complicated at higher levels.... they are<br/>
interconnected. For example, in order to make a Misty Thicket Picnic,<br/>
which is baking, you need to be able to brew at a decent level to make<br/>
jumjum beer and also be able to tailor and do blacksmithing -- to make<br/>
the basket -- in addition to baking. Brewing also benefits fletching,<br/>
you need to brew oak bark tannin in order to *brew* light mithril<br/>
string, a component in high level wood elf cultural bows. And so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes, if you get to Level 250 and want to make your trophy, you<br/>
will also need a fairly good Jewelcrafting and Blacksmithing skill.<br/>
