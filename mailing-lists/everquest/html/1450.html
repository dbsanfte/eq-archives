<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683924758">kinda what i thought.  i hear they&#39;ll aggro on you once you start attacking them.  i&#39;m not sure how hardcore i am at the<br/>
roleplaying yet, those HQ bear pelts are good loot for a lvl 10 &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi, all.  I&#39;m relatively new to the list (been reading it for a month or<br/>
&gt; so, but I&#39;ve never posted before).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my question:  My lvl 10 Druid is currently in EC and I desperately<br/>
&gt; want to start hunting bears, would this be a bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing for a Druid to do?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
