<b>Subject:</b> Accessing my 30 Days Free <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246134491">I recently purchased the Trilogy set with 30 free days of play.  <br/>
However I can not find a card or any number that would indicated a <br/>
pre-paid number.... Do I have to sign up with my card in order to <br/>
recieve to 30 free days or is there a number that is on my case... <br/>
that I should use....  I have tried these numbers and words yet they <br/>
do not work.  What am I to do?</div>
