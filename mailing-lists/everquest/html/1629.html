<br>behavior like that he would have to be guild history. &nbsp;I just don&#39;t get 
<br>it...it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a RL relationship. &nbsp;Oh well. &nbsp;I would have been soooo 
<br>mad at that guy for the train. &nbsp;

<br>friend,we&#39;ll just call her Luv. Luvs ex-boyfriend, Shift (that is his actual
<br>character name on The Tribunal), was jealous that a married player gave Luv
<br>an item.
<br>They ended up breaking up. Luv started seeing someone else. Shift started
<br>harassing her. He followed her around. Went to the zones she went to. She
<br>asked him to leave her alone. he would still harass her. So, we&#39;re on a
<br>guild raid and he shows up. He buffs me and is really polite. I thank him
<br>and am polite to him. Then Luv explains that he is her ex. He comes up and
<br>starts insulting her equipment. Saying stuff like &quot;That&#39;s a pathetic staff&quot;
<br>and stuff like that. She politely responds &quot;Well, it&#39;s the best I can get at
<br>my level&quot;. He makes some other snide remark. She tells me in group that he&#39;s
<br>annoying her. He makes her feel threatened. He goes away for awhile bc we
<br>start fighting stuff. (and we have another male character in group with us).
<br>He comes back awhile later and starts talking to her. She tells me she
<br>really doesn&#39;t want to talk to him. I tell him that she doesn&#39;t want to talk
<br>to him. (as politely as I can). He hangs around for awhile just saying
<br>nothing (as far as I know-- I think he might&#39;ve been sending her tells). I
<br>told her to put him on /ignore. she said that she tried it and it didn&#39;t
<br>work. He kept bugging her. I said maybe we should petition to make him go
<br>away.
<br>Anyways, our male group member left and it was just me and Luv. So this jerk
<br>comes back. I state that the ledge is camped. He says &quot;I see that&quot;. I said
<br>&quot;So you&#39;re here because..?&quot; He said he was going to pull a train to us. then
<br>he shouts &quot;Where is my train?&quot; I tell him &quot;no no no. We already have as much
<br>as we can handle here. don&#39;t pull any trains to us,thank you.&quot;
<br>So he goes away. We fight some elites and run out of mana killing them.
<br>Right after we were oom, he pulls a train of like 5 elites onto us saying
<br>&quot;here, take it&quot; and then leaves us to die. Luv trites to run away. he sends
<br>her a tell and laughs at her for running. I try to pull some off to buy her
<br>some time. they come and aggro on me. I try to get to safety. we both call
<br>for help. We both die. I see Shift outside and say &quot;You got me killed!&quot; he
<br>turns and runs from me. I say &quot;Hey!&quot; and he just runs off and camps.
<br>couldn&#39;t even have the decency to apologize to me. And he did it all to get
<br>at his ex-gf. Jerk. I petitioned as soon as I had come back from being dead.
<br>but he still logged before any GM answered Luv&#39;s petition. The GM never
<br>answered mine. It really sucked.
<br>luv,
