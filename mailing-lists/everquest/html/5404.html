<div id="ygrps-yiv-499050522">LOL, 4/1/99... I waited until a month after the beta<br/>
was over because there were so many problems I didn&#39;t<br/>
see it as worth messing with in March 1999 :)p  <br/>
<br/>
The fun thing about such a complicated play universe<br/>
is that there are so many ways to go about things, and<br/>
so many valid opinions.  Not one *right* one.  <br/>

&gt;    As I have read the boards over the last couple of<br/>
&gt; weeks, I can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; help but get the feeling that I am the old man of<br/>
&gt; this group. I have <br/>
&gt; been playing EQ since the beginning, and have a vast<br/>
&gt; knowledge of the <br/>
&gt; game. I current have 3 characters, a 65 Ranger, a 48<br/>
&gt; Necro, and a 44 <br/>
&gt; Rogue. I have, however, played every class into the<br/>
&gt; 30&#39;s, just to get <br/>
&gt; a feel for how each class works. Please feel free to<br/>
&gt; ask me any <br/>
&gt; questions =) I check the boards once every three<br/>
&gt; days, and will try <br/>
&gt; to answer any questions I can =)<br/>
