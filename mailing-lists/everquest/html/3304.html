<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739157019">Hi again everyone!<br/>
<br/>
	Yesterday I was playing Genmay, my Gnome Warrior and I&#39;m using a<br/>
mace as my weapon. I kept getting a message saying something like my<br/>
will isn&#39;t right to command this weapon. What does that mean? That I&#39;m<br/>
not able to use it or more specifically my class doesn&#39;t wield this<br/>
weapon as well as others? Heck I seemed to be kicking some butt with it<br/>
as my hits were ranking between 12-16 points each. Any ideas?</div>
