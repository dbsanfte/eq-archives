<div id="ygrps-yiv-609619717">Just to let you know : I saw a player (mage type) wielding this kind of <br/>
staff, he was kinda high level as he was grouped with rubicite wearing other <br/>
ones, druid who was able to teleport the group around (they were at a <br/>
druid&#39;s ring), etc.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know what this staff was, didn&#39;t ask, as I was camoed, running around <br/>
them taking screenshots. ;-)<br/>
