<div><font size="2">Yep...it does make a&nbsp;big difference.The VM tweak is just 
a little &quot;freebie&quot; for overall performance, not just EQ. 11 day uptimes on my 
WinME-based EQ box... yup, consider me convinced, fully and truly. Likewise the 
amount of sheer ABUSE my LAN server gets, and the stability and speed difference 
once the VM was fixed to reflect changes in real ram.Overall, spending $50 for a 
Geforce 2 will be an investment you&#39;re likely to be pleased with. Also, if your 
power supply is wimpy, consider invest in a bigger&nbsp;one...300 watts should 
be plenty for a Geforce 2 and sufficient cooling for everything, but 250 will do 
the trick with less breathing room...any less, upgrade.</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">You can try all of that stuff, but I would think 
  it&#39;s your CPU and video card that&#39;s hampering you more than anything.&nbsp; I 
  ran EQ on a PII 333mhz with an 8MB video card and 8MB accelerator while I was 
  in Japan.&nbsp; It was slow as molasses.&nbsp; No matter how many options I 
  turned off.&nbsp; I noticed moderately better performance once I upgraded the 
  video card.&nbsp; Even on my PIII 800 with 640MB of RAM itwould run everything 
  but Luclin.&nbsp; Then I upgraded the video card to 128MB and it ran 
  fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you really want to improve performance, upgrade your 
  video card if at all possible.&nbsp; It can sometimes compensate for a slower 
  processor.</font></div>

    <div><br></div><tt>Thank you very much indeed to everyone who has responded 
    so far. I <br>have tweaked the datarate to 7.0 and switched on the caching 
    to see <br>if that makes much difference.<br><br>We have the basic New Dawn 
    with the Planes of Power expansion. The <br>Options screen however states 
    &quot;Luclin Options&quot; - I don&#39;t know why.<br><br>As for the PC - maximum RAM 
    capacity is 384MB and that is what is <br>installed.&nbsp; There is 50Gb 
    free on the hard disk. I have noticed that <br>while loading and zoning 
    however, the hard disk light is always on <br>meaning it is doing alot of 
    work. I suppose this would be the case as <br>it is loading alot from the 
    hard disk.<br><br>Performance within a zone seems fine on the whole,it is 
    just initial <br>loading and in particular the zoning times. Very often, 
    after waiting <br>5 minutes, it simply gives up and goes back to the server 
    screen - <br>very frustrating!<br><br>The only other components that could 
    be awapped are the hard disk <br>controller - but I really don&#39;t see that 
    making much difference since <br>it is working fine, and the video 
    controller - which is a nVidia Riva <br>TNT with just 16Mb RAM. We are 
    running DirectX 9.<br><br>Thanks very much again for all of your 
    suggestions, and I would be <br>grateful for anytthing else you can 
    suggest.<br><br>Best regards.<br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the
