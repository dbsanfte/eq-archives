&gt; all expansions except LDON and it also had loy in it<br/>

&gt; thats the gaming industry way hehe.   <br/>

summer of 2004, if not later. I don&#39;t even think<br/>
they&#39;ve started beta testing it yet. SOE might have<br/>
learned their lesson when they rushed SWG out the<br/>
door, so maybe they&#39;re going to take their time with<br/>
EQ2.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, EQ1 isn&#39;t going anywhere for a long<br/>
time. As long as there is interest in EQ1, Sony will<br/>
continue to support it.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;d like to try EQ2, but I don&#39;t plan on<br/>
scrapping EQ1 the moment #2 comes out. So yes, it&#39;s<br/>
worth it to keep playing #1 :)<br/>
