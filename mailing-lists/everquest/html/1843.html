<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736901618"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Well today a necro friend GAVE me a blackened crystalline robe since I was 
<br>wearing crystalline and could use the extra CHA on the blackened one. &nbsp;That 
<br>was very very very kind of him. &nbsp;LOL &nbsp;When you get high enough, he might not 
<br>need repaid but you could pass on the gesture and help someone who needs it. &nbsp;

<br>What is the nicest thing someone has done for you in game?
<br>
<br>A friend of mine has been showing me the ropes of EQ and, when I get 
<br>high enough, I want to repay him for his kindness. &nbsp;Looking for ideas.
<br>
<br>Thanks all.
