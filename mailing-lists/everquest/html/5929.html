<div id="ygrps-yiv-982562159">I&#39;ve only been playing since Sat., but I&#39;m loving it<br/>
so far. I&#39;ve got a lvl 11 sorcerer on her way to<br/>
becoming a wizard at some point. A few of my guildies<br/>
from EQ1 are there too and we&#39;ve started up a guild.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not EQ1 with better graphics, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
It&#39;s a totally new game. In some ways it&#39;s easier than<br/>
EQ1 and in some ways it&#39;s more difficult. All in all,<br/>
I&#39;m having a blast being a true newbie, running around<br/>
and getting lost, and just exploring again.<br/>
<br/>
Death is easier to deal with, leveling seems to come<br/>
much easier, quests are all over the place and they&#39;re<br/>
worth doing, so far the community seems nice, money is<br/>
kind of hard to come by, but that&#39;s not such a big<br/>
deal since the quests tend to reward with decent<br/>
armor.<br/>
<br/>
Give it a shot :) I&#39;m on the Najena server.<br/>

&gt; it won&#39;t even load on my computer anymore. That game<br/>
&gt; is boring anyways.<br/>
