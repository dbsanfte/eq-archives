<div id="ygrps-yiv-802049790">Captain Tillin is in the Grounds of Fate (Warrior guild/Arena) in South<br/>
Qeynos. You enter the Grounds of Fate, turn right before entering the PVP<br/>
area and go up the ramp. At the top turn left and follow the elevated<br/>
walkway to the building at the other end. Go inside and turn to the left.<br/>
Captain Tillin is standing outside on the balcony.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware that turning in gnoll fangs to him lowers your faction with the<br/>
Corrupt Qeynos Guards. My level 41 druid is KOS to the Corrupt Qeynos Guards<br/>
now. Every time he has entered North Qeynos, even in wolf form, Lieutenant<br/>
Dagarok has killed him. I will say that you would have to turn in a LOT of<br/>
gnoll fangs though.<br/>
