<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131744908">One problem with the war is it can screw up the zone until the server <br/>
is reset.  They have patched it but it still breaks, though less <br/>
often.  But it is fun!<br/>
<br/>
If you want to increase your brewing cheaply just gather Payala fruit <br/>
in Shadeweaver Thicket and combine it with water.  It&#39;s a ground drop <br/>
so anyone can find it.  Just look for the blue topped trees.  It <br/>
makes Shar Val essence, triv at 180+.<br/>

&gt; &gt; To start the quest you should speak to Master Barkem in Shar Vahl <br/>
at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; smithing building.  The first part of the quest can be found at<br/>
&gt; &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1542">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1542</a><br/>
&gt; &gt; You have to do this quest twice to get 2 carapaces.....then smith <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; carapaces with a tunic mold and nepeta oil, sold by Chialle near <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; bridge<br/>
&gt; &gt; to shadeweavers, to make the bloodling mail.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hand the tunic to Barkem to get the first hammer. Then you are <br/>
assigned<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; task of repairing the bridge guard shields.  Ask Barkem [What <br/>
repair<br/>
&gt; order]<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get the order, then head to one of the two guards at the end <br/>
of each<br/>
&gt; &gt; bridge, Shadeweavers and Hollowshade.  Handing them the order <br/>
gets you<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; shield. Take the shield and hammer and combine in a forge to get <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; repaired shield, then hand the shield back to its owner before he<br/>
&gt; respawns.<br/>
&gt; &gt; he will hand you a letter.  Once you do all 4 guards, the 2 at <br/>
the end of<br/>
&gt; &gt; shadeweavers and the 2 at the end of hollowshade, you will then <br/>
be given<br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; anvil and told to make shadow disks.  To make the disks you <br/>
combine 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; swirling shadow with 1 metal bit in a forge with the hammer and <br/>
anvil.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Barkem will hand you a box to put 10 in.  After that, you move on <br/>
to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; humming orbs.  Handing Barkem 3 orbs plus your hammer gets you <br/>
the hammer<br/>
&gt; &gt; used to make shadowscream armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As for the substances, that requires running the war of <br/>
hollowshade.  the<br/>
&gt; &gt; basics of the war is this.......<br/>
&gt; &gt; Each camp has a trigger, for the grimling camp in the south its <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Grimling<br/>
&gt; &gt; Chief, for the wolves east cave its Ghowlik, and for the owlbears <br/>
its the<br/>
&gt; &gt; named in back of the caves (was never good at remembering the bear<br/>
&gt; &gt; names....so oddballed.)  Killing this trigger usually sets off <br/>
the enemy<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; attack them.  The war moves in one direction...the mobs <br/>
controling the<br/>
&gt; north<br/>
&gt; &gt; cave always attacks the south camp, south camp always attacks the <br/>
east<br/>
&gt; cave,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and east cave always attacks the north cave.  So to get a mob you <br/>
want in<br/>
&gt; &gt; control of one area, you need to get them to the attacking camp, <br/>
then<br/>
&gt; &gt; trigger them to attack the one you want them at.  Once a mob <br/>
controls 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; camps however, if they are attacked they do not spawn defenders <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; camp<br/>
&gt; &gt; under attack.  The substances you want will drop off the owlbears <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; sonic<br/>
&gt; &gt; wolves once they take the south camp area, rarely they drop off <br/>
the others<br/>
&gt; &gt; but its a once in a 100 kills.  South camp kills are one almost <br/>
every<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill.  The wolves drop Shrieking substances, looks like a blueish <br/>
green<br/>
&gt; &gt; rock, and the owlbears drop wailing substances, looks like an <br/>
orange orb.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Combine 1 each of the substances with the hammer, anvil, one <br/>
metal ring,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; water to make the orb, then combine the right number of orbs, <br/>
swirling<br/>
&gt; &gt; shadows, and mold to make shadowscream armor.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Btw...i had heard some trivs near lower 200s, but now see most <br/>
trivs in<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher 200s<br/>
