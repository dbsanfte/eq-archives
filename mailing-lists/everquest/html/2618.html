<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a Geforce 4 MX 
440.&nbsp; The problem was not with my card but I had a bad dll in my Direct x 
at one point.&nbsp; Once i reformated my drive and reinstalled everything the 
game worked fine.&nbsp; I am happy becasue I dit not lose my character and that 
is good.&nbsp;&nbsp; The geforce card I have only has 64 MB DDR ram not the 128 
mb ddr ram that the geforce 4 Tiu cards have.&nbsp; But the graphics rock on the 
new card.</font></div></html></div>
