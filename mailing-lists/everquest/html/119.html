<b>Subject:</b> High Pass Hold <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060156124">Ok, I&#39;&#39;m a 9th Level Barbarian Warrior and last night I decided to make the <br/>
treacherous run from Queynos to Freeport.  I got as far as High Pass Hold <br/>
when I was waylaid and killed by a gnoll soothsayer.  I retrieved my corpse <br/>
and then spent an hour running around trying to find the way out of High Pass <br/>
Hold towards Freeport.  IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING!!!  It was also scary as hell <br/>
seeing how I was practically naked and the only player character in the <br/>
entire zone.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please give me some advice or direction in how to get the hell <br/>
out of High Pass Hold and through to Freeport?<br/>
