<div id="ygrps-yiv-699862896">What about permafrost.?<br/>
I was out there yesterday and there were only 6 people<br/>
in there.  Tough to find a group but it seems to have<br/>
high level monsters in it<br/>

&gt; &gt; The other day I decided that a trip to Kunark was<br/>
&gt; in order for my <br/>
&gt; &gt; druid. I will be needing Brute hides, and so was<br/>
&gt; ready to go and <br/>
&gt; hunt <br/>
&gt; &gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never<br/>
&gt; met the boat. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and<br/>
&gt; they went out to <br/>
&gt; &gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the<br/>
&gt; boat left. The <br/>
&gt; &gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick<br/>
&gt; off gnolls, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool<br/>
&gt; box full of them. <br/>
&gt; &gt; have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there<br/>
&gt; until I get the <br/>
&gt; &gt; rest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the<br/>
&gt; gnolls, which I have <br/>
&gt; &gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to<br/>
&gt; sell.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I<br/>
&gt; want to do it the <br/>
&gt; &gt; old-fashioned way.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve found the big boat to FV to be broken too. <br/>
&gt; Luckily I have a <br/>
&gt; friend that&#39;s a Druid so I got a port to the DL.  I<br/>
&gt; tried to petition <br/>
&gt; the GM but it doesn&#39;t work if there isn&#39;t one on!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kunark is a dangerous place for the good races.  The<br/>
&gt; only place you <br/>
&gt; can bind a good melee is in FV and it&#39;s surrounded<br/>
&gt; by mid-level <br/>
&gt; mobs.  If you port over you end up in the DL, which<br/>
&gt; is ok, it&#39;s just <br/>
&gt; getting out of there that&#39;s the problem!  The DL<br/>
&gt; does have <br/>
&gt; connections to the FM and FV if you know where to<br/>
&gt; look.  It&#39;s not a <br/>
&gt; place to be without a map!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I am also looking for a place to take me to the<br/>
&gt; mid-40&#39;s.  I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; been to the moon, Kunark, the Karanas and Velious. <br/>
&gt; I like to go to <br/>
&gt; the zones that have been abandoned, like all the<br/>
&gt; dungones on <br/>
&gt; Anatonica.  I&#39;m in the FM now and will probably be<br/>
&gt; in the DL, like <br/>
&gt; everyone else. <br/>
