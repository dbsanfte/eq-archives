<div id="ygrps-yiv-901089377">OK back to ingame stuff..<br/>
<br/>
I was discussing EQ with a friend and fellow player the other day and I <br/>
came up with a question. It has been a long time since I have seriously <br/>
played, I have returned for brief periods, but nothing fulltime. My <br/>
first question is..is there some npc you can go to ( or some other <br/>
method) that will tell you what you faction is...ya know..who like you <br/>
and who doesnt. It has been a long time and I dont recall who and what <br/>
factions I was building and destroying. Im thinking its as easy as the <br/>
seer in PoK that tells you what steps are needed for Planar progression.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and btw... in my sheer boredom, i went through the EQ file and <br/>
hooked all the songs from the different zones so they&#39;d play in their <br/>
own playlist on my media player. If you listen to them all in series <br/>
like this, it actually isnt a bad soundtrack. Just thought id let you <br/>
all in on that.<br/>
<br/>
AS always,<br/>
<br/>
