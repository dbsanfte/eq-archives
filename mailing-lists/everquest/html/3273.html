&gt; I have had Clerics and casters bail on me.  It happens.  People don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; realize that if they unload that big damage DD or DoT or heal for too<br/>
&gt; much too soon the mob is going to head straight for them.  It can be<br/>
&gt; hard to hold aggro on a mob when that happens.  My Ranger has had to<br/>
&gt; become good at peeling the mobs off the casters just to keep them<br/>
&gt; alive.  They&#39;ll never make it if they run!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have seen and been involved in total party wipeouts, and they are<br/>
&gt; no fun!  I&#39;d rather the Cleric survive it, maybe we&#39;ll get a Rez?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I play a Cleric from time to time as well.  He fights to the death<br/>
&gt; and beyond!  So he has a melee mentality!<br/>

Well, sometimes it&#39;s not even the healing, its sometimes when the tank goes<br/>
and pulls 10 mobs after the casters have stated they are low mana. And if I<br/>
think it will help I will have my cleric beat on things with his hammer.<br/>
Mostly when he can&#39;t med bc he gets aggrod whenever he sits so his option is<br/>
to stand there and be useless or hit the mob from behind. and yeah, I&#39;ve had<br/>
the people pull and dump a bunch of mobs on me and then flee. I generally<br/>
always announce that I am going to run just before I run and I tell the<br/>
other members &quot;I&#39;m oom. RUN!&quot; Sometimes I will stop and wait for the people<br/>
to run past me. Depends on the pull. If they are not trying to tank the mob<br/>
off of me and I can&#39;t get it off and will die, I will pull it to the guards.<br/>
luv,<br/>
