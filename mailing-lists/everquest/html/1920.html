<div id="ygrps-yiv-859317748">I took the advice of others here and having finished my goals in EK I <br/>
moved to SK. I have found the gnolls camped heavily, but while there <br/>
have found Aviak Rooks wandering with sufficient frequency to be <br/>
profitable. I solo them, getting about 1.5pp average in cash and <br/>
loot. Not too bad, and I can pick off something else when they are <br/>
too thin. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone know if the hq ore dropped in Runnyeye is no drop? My druid <br/>
does not do that well in dungeons, so hunting up the stuff myself is <br/>
not a happy prospect.<br/>
