<b>Subject:</b> Question about some of the new zones <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-655850283">I have all of the expansions, except for PoR, but I&#39;ve found the newer<br/>
zones to be just flat out TOUGH.  I don&#39;t group much (thanks to many<br/>
bad experiences of late) and I&#39;ve found that new world zones are just<br/>
too difficult for my 63 Beastlord to handle, even with a suped up pet.<br/>
 I can barely handle Coranthas Creep with CV, KEI (C3), and Wunshi,<br/>
and the pet with CV and Wunshi.  I know a BL wasn&#39;t designed to be a<br/>
tank, but even with sharing tanking duties with the pet, I kill one<br/>
mob and have to med and heal for 10 minutes to fight another mob.  I<br/>
do better going to Veksar and fighting there in the basement, but that<br/>
kind of defeats the purpose of buying the newest expansion.  If all I<br/>
can do is hunt in old world zones, why buy the expansion?  Or am I<br/>
just doing something wrong?</div>
