 </span></blockquote>I have had Clerics and casters bail on me.  It happens.  People don&#39;t <br/>
realize that if they unload that big damage DD or DoT or heal for too <br/>
much too soon the mob is going to head straight for them.  It can be <br/>
hard to hold aggro on a mob when that happens.  My Ranger has had to <br/>
become good at peeling the mobs off the casters just to keep them <br/>
alive.  They&#39;ll never make it if they run!<br/>
<br/>
I have seen and been involved in total party wipeouts, and they are <br/>
no fun!  I&#39;d rather the Cleric survive it, maybe we&#39;ll get a Rez?<br/>
<br/>
I play a Cleric from time to time as well.  He fights to the death <br/>
and beyond!  So he has a melee mentality!<br/>
