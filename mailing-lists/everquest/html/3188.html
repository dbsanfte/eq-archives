<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You will get better as it takes longer to level and 
you will have more time to get your skills up. Weapon skill has a major effect 
on your attack abilities. The maximum skill you can have in a weapon type I 
think is Level * 5 + 5, so the highest skill you could have in 1hs at level 11 
is 60 which is much higher than the 25 you currently have. Generally you should 
try to get your skills up in all available&nbsp;weapon types as you might get 
your hands on something really nice and you will want to have at least some 
ability with it. So yeah you should alternate between the weapon types and try 
to be good at each one.</font></div>

  question</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>Ok, I have a level 11 warrior and would like 
  your<br>opinion on the following:<br><br>I started wondering why I was not 
  hitting that much<br>with him even though he has a good weapon. After 
  some<br>research, I found that the reason I am not hitting as<br>much as 
  others is because I have been switching<br>between 2HS and 1HS weapons to 
  increase the skills of<br>each attribute.&nbsp; <br><br>Example: My skill in 
  both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br>attack is at like 152.&nbsp; If I were to just 
  use 1HS<br>let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br><br>I have 
  proved this because now that I am using the 1HS<br>more, the skill is close to 
  30 and my ATK rating is<br>close to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is still 
  at<br>152.<br><br><br>Would you continue to alternate both weapon types 
  or<br>would you just pick one and go with 
  it?<br><br>THanks<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do
