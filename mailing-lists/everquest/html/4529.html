<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-473011769">Thank you very much indeed to everyone who has responded so far. I <br/>
have tweaked the datarate to 7.0 and switched on the caching to see <br/>
if that makes much difference.<br/>
<br/>
We have the basic New Dawn with the Planes of Power expansion. The <br/>
Options screen however states &quot;Luclin Options&quot; - I don&#39;t know why.<br/>
<br/>
As for the PC - maximum RAM capacity is 384MB and that is what is <br/>
installed.  There is 50Gb free on the hard disk. I have noticed that <br/>
while loading and zoning however, the hard disk light is always on <br/>
meaning it is doing alot of work. I suppose this would be the case as <br/>
it is loading alot from the hard disk.<br/>
<br/>
Performance within a zone seems fine on the whole,it is just initial <br/>
loading and in particular the zoning times. Very often, after waiting <br/>
5 minutes, it simply gives up and goes back to the server screen - <br/>
very frustrating!<br/>
<br/>
The only other components that could be awapped are the hard disk <br/>
controller - but I really don&#39;t see that making much difference since <br/>
it is working fine, and the video controller - which is a nVidia Riva <br/>
TNT with just 16Mb RAM. We are running DirectX 9.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much again for all of your suggestions, and I would be <br/>
grateful for anytthing else you can suggest.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards.</div>
