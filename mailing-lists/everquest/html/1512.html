<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073832912">It could be anything from her ISP, her phone line, her modem, to a virus on<br/>
her computer.<br/>
It all depends. She would have to speak to tech support for troubleshooting.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a friend who is having an unusually difficult time signing on and<br/>
&gt; staying online.  It seems that just about any time she zones, you can<br/>
&gt; assume she will not be on anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is this a common problem?  Does anyone have some &quot;quick fix&quot; ideas that<br/>
&gt; might keep her from being punted so easily?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help.<br/>
