<div id="ygrps-yiv-778389420">You can teach someone  to one better than your current  skill, long as<br/>
you&#39;re grouped and in the same zone. I&#39;ve got chars there, MANY languages,<br/>
want  to work together some time? You can also spam back and forth  with<br/>
multiple  ppl so that you can go from one person with skill 1 to everyone<br/>
in group at skill 100 if  you&#39;re  patient.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Languages<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was curious what has changed about the languages.  I used to be able to<br/>
teach a language to my group and get better at it.  This is no longer so,<br/>
and I talked to a GM who told me this was never so.  I was also told that<br/>
something changed in respect to languages and zoning or something.  I am<br/>
quite curious about this, as I am trying to learn every language I can.  I<br/>
was also curious if you could teach over your own knowledge in the language.<br/>
Thank you in advance for your replies.<br/>
