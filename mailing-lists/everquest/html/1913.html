<br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote TYPE="CITE" style="BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;">I am a halfling druid, lvl 26. I currently hunt craig spiders in east 
<br>karanas to get the nice silk drops. I use this to build my tailoring 
<br>skills. Soon I will no longer get exp with these hunts, and I will 
<br>have advanced my tailoring as much as possible with craig spiders 
<br>silk. So, I am wondering where I can go to make some money.
<br>
<br>I know that I can go to Neriak and camp guards for their 2pp bronze 
<br>weapons, but wonder if there is anything equally profitable which 
<br>will also net me some exp and perhaps let me explore some place new. 
<br>
<br>any suggestions?
