<div id="ygrps-yiv-602850426">Heh, its way to late for that.  I haven&#39;t needed my<br/>
training points since I got flying kick at 35... I&#39;d<br/>
be pissed that I used them on beg and stuff and then<br/>
they became valuable again.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on the game since April 1, 1999 and at this<br/>
point have &quot;master&quot; level skill in everything<br/>
including trade skills.  All melee skills a monk can<br/>
have are maxed, so my big skill thrill is improving<br/>
beg now (145).  <br/>
<br/>
For you trade skillers, wow, tailoring is a bitch<br/>
(176), and wow, jeweling is expensive (180), the<br/>
others are easy enough.  They are next to useless on a<br/>
mature server, but its fun to skill up anyway.  I use<br/>
my trade skills for equipping newbies, mostly my own<br/>
but sometimes other players.<br/>

&gt; is that you end up with a lot of  excess training<br/>
&gt; points you can&#39;t use.  You get 5 training points<br/>
&gt; each level you go up.  However, you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; necessarily get 5 new skills each level so if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; like me, you put one point into the new skill to get<br/>
&gt; it started then let the course of the game and use<br/>
&gt; of that skill cause it to go up.  Of course after a<br/>
&gt; certain point you get charged plat for training, not<br/>
&gt; to mention the training point.  Well I don&#39;t need<br/>
&gt; the training points but I can&#39;t spend them on<br/>
&gt; anything else.  So I find it&#39;s a waste of plat to<br/>
&gt; have to pay for training.   But what can ya do? <br/>
&gt; They should have some kind of reward process<br/>
&gt; implemented where you can convert your non-used<br/>
&gt; training points into AA points or back into plat.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;      OK, You can train your trade skills ( baking,<br/>
&gt; Tailoring, ect) To <br/>
&gt; 21 and after a few free points it does start<br/>
&gt; charging. Languages and <br/>
&gt; other skills like 1 hb 2 hb and slashing can be<br/>
&gt; trained way on past <br/>
&gt; 21 at your trainer depending on your level.  My<br/>
&gt; druid has always used <br/>
&gt; a 1hb When I decided to het a scimitar at lv 48 I<br/>
&gt; trained as high as <br/>
&gt; I could and it was costing several plat a point  I<br/>
&gt; paid over a <br/>
&gt; hundred to gain skill level at trainer.  <br/>
&gt;     I have been on almost 4 years and it has been<br/>
&gt; this way the entire <br/>
&gt; time I have  played. I beleive the reason trade<br/>
&gt; skills are capped at <br/>
&gt; 21 is to create player based economy for and to<br/>
&gt; reward those willing <br/>
&gt; to go out and put the work in something.<br/>
