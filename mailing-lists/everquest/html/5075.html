<div id="ygrps-yiv-546548177">I am a lvl 41 Halfling Druid. Haven&#39;t purchased LDoN yet, as I most<br/>
often play solo and don&#39;t know that I would use it. Have everything up<br/>
to this expansion, but am not convinced that it is worthwhile. Sounds<br/>
very nice, but I have had two guilds I have been a part of fade away,<br/>
and this sounds like something best suited to guilds.<br/>
