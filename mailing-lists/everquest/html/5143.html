<div id="ygrps-yiv-835841608">You have to go to the city you started in and you should hear a <br/>
second voice.  If you&#39;ve managed to piss them off you can got to WK <br/>
near the undead camp or Rathe Mtns at the Gypses.  They will tell you <br/>
who to talk to and what to say.  Then find the Wayfarer camp you were <br/>
directed to and your in!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  My low level alt have no trouble in LDoN.  Of course he&#39;s <br/>
a Troll Warrior!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m hoping someone can remind me about this... I got the LDoN <br/>
message about <br/>
&gt; who to speak to for the adventure stone when I was level 16, and <br/>
since I wasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; at 20 yet, I didn&#39;t do it. Now that I&#39;m at 22, I can&#39;t remember who <br/>
it was I <br/>
&gt; was supposed to talk to. Who is the person in Halas that gives you <br/>
the stone?<br/>
