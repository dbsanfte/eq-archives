<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109074891">Yes, it can happen to you!  A few days ago, my hubby was having fun<br/>
with some guildmates when POOF! the guild was no more.  Took some<br/>
figuring out but apparently the person that originally started the<br/>
guild and was tagged as the &#39;owner&#39; wanted to make a new guild but was<br/>
unable because she was still listed as owning Circle of Majik.  She<br/>
had been forced out of the guild about a year ago because of her<br/>
thievery and lying.  She was unwelcome with the current leadership of<br/>
Gawabiwa and could not get control except by force.  She went to<br/>
Verant and had her leader powers reinstated then promptly dropped<br/>
everyone out of the guild without any kind of warning.<br/>
<br/>
What a dirty underhanded thing to do!  She didn&#39;t have to drop<br/>
everyone! or even anyone!  She could have come in and told everyone<br/>
before hand, instead she had to yank it out from under us.  It hurt us<br/>
to the core, but Gawabiwa has built a close knit guild and we are not<br/>
our name.  We will rebuild our guild and get ourselves back on track.<br/>
 We won&#39;t be having anything to do with whatever guild she has whether<br/>
called Circle of Majik or not.  <br/>
<br/>
We have lots of support too.  Check out the guild forum page for this<br/>
controversy <br/>

 <br/>
One thing I&#39;ve learned, if the current leadership doesn&#39;t own the<br/>
guild, the owner can do anything they please with out anybody else&#39;s<br/>
permission, and that is just plain wrong!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about ranting so long, but I&#39;m mad about this.<br/>
