<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086235962">Hey all I was just wondering how much Everquest has changed since November<br/>
(last time I was able to log in) last year expansion-wise.  This new<br/>
expansion I&#39;m hearing about sounds interesting.  BTW I&#39;m currently on<br/>
deployment and have no internet access.<br/>

I can&#39;t even get into the normal game. I keep trying and all I get is 1017<br/>
all the time. I may have to cancel my accounts if this keeps up. No point in<br/>
paying for a game I can&#39;t play.<br/>
luv,<br/>

The latest patch message I saw said that the monster alts was not working<br/>
yet.  And some NPCs whose character models are not in zone yet are replaced<br/>
by the standard human model.  They call this model &quot;Doug&quot;.<br/>
