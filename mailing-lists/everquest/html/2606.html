<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001328166">Welcome back to EQ!<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing EQ since September of 2000 or so. I obviously enjoy<br/>
playing. :-) I&#39;m not sure exactly what kind of advice you&#39;re asking for<br/>
here. Anything specific you need to know about?<br/>
luv,<br/>

Hi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. I am not a very good EQ<br/>
player. I would consider myself ultra competent in group battles, but in<br/>
other aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I have never gotten a<br/>
character past level 40. My first character was an Erudite Enchanter by the<br/>
name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to level 40 after two years or<br/>
so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which was my friends character but I<br/>
own it. I just started playing again after giving up on the game and playing<br/>
DAOC. Eventually I gave up all MMORPGS deciding they were a waste of time.<br/>
About a week ago, I decided to give EQ another chance and have decided that<br/>
it has improved a great deal. I am now playing a Human Ranger who is level<br/>
30. I really like the character. His buffs and damage spells are great. I<br/>
guess I could use some help on how to be a good EQ player. I have been<br/>
playing for about two years and I feel like I know absolutely nothing about<br/>
the game. I have never belonged to a good guild or anything. I play on the<br/>
Xegony server.</div>
