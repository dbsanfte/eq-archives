EQ!&nbsp; Your life will never be the same.&nbsp; Having never played a Pally, 
here are some general thoughts:</font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1938704803409101222-19022002"><font face="Tahoma" color="#0000ff">#1 DOn&#39;t 
feel rushed to get your first character up to higher levels.&nbsp; EQ is a huge 
place and there is so much to do and see.&nbsp; If you take your time you will 
have a much better experience, IMHO!&nbsp; (I played my Ranger for a year and he 
only reached 27).&nbsp; </font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1938704803409101222-19022002"><font face="Tahoma" color="#0000ff">#2 Take the 
time to learn at least 1&nbsp;trade skill.&nbsp; You can make some decent cash 
when you become proficient at most trades.&nbsp; It is also&nbsp;a good way to 
make EQ friends.</font></span></div>

are ready to join a guild, be selective and play with some people from that 
guild for a while to make sure that you enjoy their company.&nbsp; You can 
always leave the guild later if it doesn&#39;t work out.&nbsp; But remember guilds 
are only as good as their members. Participate and help your guildies out when 
you can.&nbsp; In return they will be there for you when you need 
it.</font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1938704803409101222-19022002"><font face="Tahoma" color="#0000ff">#4 Under NO 
circumstances should you EVER beg!&nbsp; Ther is nothing that experienced 
players hate more than a beggar!&nbsp; Always offer plat or something in trade 
for something you are seeking.&nbsp; SoW&#39;s and Rez&#39;s 
especially!</font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1938704803409101222-19022002"><font face="Tahoma" color="#0000ff">#5 You will 
have to explore different zones to find an area that you enjoy hunting in.&nbsp; 
If you like to group and read a lot of OOC and Shouts, you may want to get 
yourself to a place like Lake of Ill Omen.&nbsp; But if you are a solo, solitary 
kinda person, places like Ocean of Tears may suit you better.&nbsp; I like to 
find zones that are somewhere in between.&nbsp; Enough people to get a good 
group going, but not overcamped and populated by a bunch of people wanting 
everything for free.&nbsp; This is, of course, a matter of taste.&nbsp;

like to group, make friends and stay in touch with them.&nbsp; Most people like 
to adventure with a partner or a group, it makes traveling much more fun.&nbsp;
