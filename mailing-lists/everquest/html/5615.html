<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891566042">Probably a video card upgrade will be the key to better play. There<br/>
are some nice ones dropping below $200, if your budget allows. Large<br/>
on-card memory seems to be very important in this game. From what I<br/>
have culled from this group and others like it, upgrading the video<br/>
card as often as is affordable is the best way to maintain or even<br/>
improve performance as the game evolves.<br/>
<br/>
We are constantly put in the position of having to upgrade our<br/>
machines if we want to play online games. I would be out of this if my<br/>
son did not have the disposable income to keep up a nice machine. I<br/>
can&#39;t seem to justify the upgrade (more replacement) of this machine<br/>
to my wife and financial manager. Somehow having to get a new car,<br/>
paint the house, finance other repairs, and such preclude a kick-ass<br/>
machine for me.<br/>
<br/>
I keep access to my son&#39;s machine by giving him free rent. With<br/>
housing costs the way they are around here, he will stay forever.<br/>
Bwa-ha-ha!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that dx9 isn&#39;t so great. I was getting used to things<br/>
with the previous version. I have a GeForce Ti 4600 vid card, 1GB of<br/>
RAM, 1.4GHz processor... and I keep lagging really badly, have lousy<br/>
framerate, and zonecrash alot more. I also can&#39;t target corpses. Even<br/>
with /tar it isn&#39;t working all the time. which sucks for a cleric<br/>
trying to rez. It&#39;s extremely frustrating. I hope they fix this soon.<br/>
Oh, and all that is with particle effects off, clip plane set low, and<br/>
most luclin models off.<br/>
