<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586283092">I was getting back into it because of my brother but he transferred to another server so I don&#39;t have anyone to group with. My latency makes it nearly impossible to hunt. I get my ass kicked by greens. So I&#39;m back to not getting xp. On the bright side, my Sims2 game is working now so I can play it instead. I can&#39;t play online games when it&#39;s raining anyways and the weather has been bad.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt;hoping EQ2 would get it.  Maybe they&#39;ll stick it in at some point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sounds like some nice changes to EQ1.  But I believe I&#39;m just burnt out <br/>
&gt;beyond hope.  I still like hearing what&#39;s going on, though. :)<br/>

&gt;&gt;Let&#39;s see... They&#39;ve revamped Splitpaw, the Bazaar, and Lavastorm. Added new wayfarer type camps and new zones. You can now zone into the bazaar from PoK. There is also a guild hall where you can summon your corpse to and have it rezzed by any available clerics. There is now ingame email to send messages to people when they are offline... A whole guild messenging center in the guild hall where people can look for guilds and guilds can look for people.<br/>
&gt;&gt;If you get mnemonic retention with AA points it gives you a 9th spellslot... There are new quests and such..<br/>
&gt;&gt;Right now they are celibrating the 6th anniversary so there are fabled mobs and a scavenger hunt quest going.<br/>
&gt;&gt;That&#39;s all I can really think of right now.  I&#39;ve been playing casually.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have been gone from EQ for a long time ( a year in MAY). I have <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;played occasionally since then, but never &quot;full-time&quot; since MAY like <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I used to...I hear something have changed<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Can anyone give me a list or such of the thinngs that have changed <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;since May of last year..I know of a couple expansions..but not sure <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;much else. I want to be informed before i return to EQ <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;again &quot;fulltime&quot; and not feel like a newb again (is a nasty feeling)<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks<br/>
