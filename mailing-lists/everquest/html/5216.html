&gt; We all know that there are rude peeps on EQ.  There is one person <br/>
&gt; that almost everyone on the Fennin server knows.  Uncledread.  The <br/>
&gt; other night someone petitioned the GM&#39;s on an unrelated issue and <br/>
&gt; right after the gm introduced him/her self, he/she asked if the <br/>
&gt; petition was about Uncledread.  The person went ahead and said <br/>
yes.  <br/>
&gt; Uncledread&#39;s account is now banned lol.  That will hopefully teach <br/>
&gt; him a lesson and change his attitude towards other people.  I <br/>
guess <br/>
&gt; he had so many bad flags on his account that the GM&#39;s decided <br/>
enough <br/>
&gt; is enough.  Why waste our time on this guy if he keeps ignoring <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; warnings.  I&#39;ve only been playing EQ for about 3 months to the day <br/>
&gt; and despite the negative aspects, I am addicted hehe.  Not so much <br/>
&gt; addicted as to getting mad about having to do RL stuff but <br/>
addicted <br/>
&gt; enough to sometimes say lol in RL speech or to say &quot;group&quot; <br/>
or &quot;guild&quot; <br/>
&gt; verbally before saying something to someone lol.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The 41st Iksar Necromancer formally known as Necrosars Corpses.<br/>
&gt; Now known as Piezie V&#39;rix :(<br/>
&gt; (My name was changed without my knowledge because the combination <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; saw as part Necromancer and part Iksar, someone else saw <br/>
as &#39;NE&#39;(any)<br/>
&gt; cro&#39;SARS&#39; &#39;CORPSES&#39;.  I mean come on.  That is just rediculous.  <br/>
I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; still trying to get my name back hehe.  One day, one day.  O btw <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; edumicate the masses, more people die from the Flu each year than <br/>
&gt; that stupid SARS thing everyone is so fricken afraid of.  I mean <br/>
come <br/>
&gt; on.  You get more germs on your hands grabbing the door handle of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; restroom than you do wiping your self with your hand.  A lot good <br/>
&gt; washing your hands did before you touched the door handle lol.  <br/>
Well <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll quit babbleing.   I&#39;m just so bored.  I&#39;m at college and i <br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; play everquest on the computers there.  I look forward to reading <br/>
&gt; more chats :D<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also the 19th Iksar Shaman known as Gloknich.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
