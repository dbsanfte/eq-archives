<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We did&nbsp; something like a total of 6 weeks 
straight in PoA every Thursday up until last week. Several of our members needed 
one thing or the other from there. Most of the first couple of weeks were for 
getting keys for those who didnt have em&nbsp; me being one of em lol.&nbsp; I 
would love to be see our guild do a weekend long raid unfortunately&nbsp; a good 
portion of our members myself included tend to have to work on the weekends so 
we opted to have our raid nights on Thursdays seeing as most of our members are 
available to raid on that night.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks for the compliments as well.&nbsp; And the 
Pink Barb is actually our Guild Leader.&nbsp; Our Trade Meister Suggested that 
Eezeytee dye his armor for an April Folls Joke and Tee being the&nbsp; guy that 
he is agreed.&nbsp; He ran around all day&nbsp; in that armor and was shoing his 
&quot;Feminine Side&quot; to everyone.&nbsp; It was funnier than all get out that day 
lol</font></div>

    <p>Excellent job on the flash....as someone previou said, the only problem I 
    had with it was the red text, but hell, it was your first flash movie, so I 
    wont crucify you for that hehe. Some of the things you guys are doing on the 
    movie brings back some memories. Noone on my server goes to PoA anymore, and 
    I miss it. I have the quest sandals and haste belt for monks from PoA and 
    had a blast getting them. Now people just take a group of lvl 65s up to get 
    epic parts. No weekend long raids or anything like that. But anyway, enough 
    of this old fart (since 1999 lol) reminiscing. Good job, excellent choice of 
    music, and great screenshots. Love the pink Barb at the end lol. </p>
