<div id="ygrps-yiv-908742503">Hey, some people have different needs, and are more sensative. I hope <br/>
TC can find someplace which meets those needs, and does it well.<br/>
<br/>
As it is, I find this group generally quite fine. Then again, I have <br/>
worked in a jail for the past thirteen years. My skin is a bit thick. <br/>
As is my head, obviously, if I haven&#39;t found a better way to earn a <br/>
living than working in a jail.<br/>
<br/>
Days off are good, though. Lots of gaming time.<br/>
