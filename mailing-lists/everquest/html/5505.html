<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-155793301">Folks I need some tips. I grouped for the first time ever in the <br/>
camp in the Northern end of Paludal Caverns. I had no idea what to <br/>
do so I kept everybody healed. My character is a level 23 shaman. <br/>
<br/>
Then I was told that I should be giving everybody dex buffs instead. <br/>
So I did. I told everyone that to tell me when they needed more <br/>
buffing. Then, after a while, I was told about something called a <br/>
gropu channel and that I ought to click &quot;say&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Note that I gathered that while watching text scroll up and off my <br/>
screen faster than I could read it. Everytime that a mob bealched, I <br/>
got a line of text. Things were very lively.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 24 now. I figured out that right clicking the dialog bar <br/>
will pull a box that will let me filter out everything but group <br/>
chat using group-say.<br/>
<br/>
How is a shaman important to a group? What does the group need most <br/>
from the shaman? What is a shaman expected to know?<br/>
<br/>
My character is Gunli on the Luclin server.</div>
