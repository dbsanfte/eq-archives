<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310589182">Couple of guildies were in a war, good against evil. GM recruited people in<br/>
EC and ported them away to the karanas. Multi group killing, they were in<br/>
the evil team.<br/>
<br/>
Another guildie was in a Firiona Vie defending assault against dark races.<br/>
So small events popped up here and there.<br/>

<br/>
Has anyone seen or heard of any events going on for this?  I remember <br/>
around the time Stormhammer was opened they had a week of adventure.  <br/>
I could get into a war!<br/>
