Lately I haven&#39;t been able to login much though. I&#39;ve been having alot of problems with my ISP. They are sending someone out on the 11th to come check my satellite and figure out what&#39;s wrong. The original installer put the satellite too low and they may have to raise it up.<br/>
Right now I can&#39;t even load webpages but I can read email and use instant messengers.<br/>
luv,<br/>
