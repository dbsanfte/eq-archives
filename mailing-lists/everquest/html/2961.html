&gt; bat wings, fish a mess of fish. Combine in oven, one and one. The<br/>

&gt; Haven&#39;t found a quick and easy way to advance pottery, yet. Tailoring<br/>
&gt; has been my primary skill, advancing with my main experience as I<br/>
&gt; made my own armor. Hope one day to make Misty armor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have found a very easy way to advance pottery. make small bowls til<br/>
trivial at about 102 or so. Don&#39;t even bother to use the kiln. just make<br/>
unfinished pots on the wheel and ditch them. the price it costs for the<br/>
metal sheet to fire is the same price you get paid to sell the bowl. it&#39;s<br/>
not worth the time.<br/>
Tailoring has been a thorn in my side. Had a hard time finding supplies.<br/>
Just have bad luck. heh.<br/>
And did you see some of the new armor quests now? I&#39;m miffed that the bard<br/>
armor quest is only for humans and half-elves.<br/>
