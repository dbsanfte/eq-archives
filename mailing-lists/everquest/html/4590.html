<div id="ygrps-yiv-611720389">Well if you have luclin, I say head on over to Paludal<br/>
Caverns. There is no better place from 15-25.  You can<br/>
level 3 times in a few hours of consistent good play. <br/>
Only thing is, get yourself someone who can cure<br/>
Disease because Creeping Crud is a bad bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
If not, you can do Oasis until 18 or head to the High<br/>
Hold Pass, which is hard to find a group because of<br/>
paludal but still is good.  Or, go to unrest and fight<br/>
in the yard.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck Friend<br/>

&gt; Thanks to the <br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I now have a problem and again ask for some help...I<br/>
&gt; am trying a Bar. <br/>
&gt; Beastlord. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I now need to find a place to move on to and advance<br/>
&gt; in levels, with <br/>
&gt; my shaman I found I &quot;ran in to a wall&quot; at 15th level<br/>
&gt; and it was like <br/>
&gt; pulling teeth to make 16th , 17 and 18th levels. I<br/>
&gt; want of avoid this <br/>
&gt; with my BL.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I have made it to 15th level (thanks to Mammoth<br/>
&gt; calfs and wrath orc <br/>
&gt; wristbands) I have all my spells for 15th level,<br/>
&gt; most of my armor is <br/>
&gt; magic or BL newbee Quest armor. I have the Newbee<br/>
&gt; Claw,and a harpoon <br/>
&gt; I could use a better hth weapon but by all acounts I<br/>
&gt; am doing good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where does a 15th level Bar. Beastlord hunt to make<br/>
&gt; levels in good <br/>
&gt; time?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thank you and will keep you all informed on how I<br/>
&gt; do.<br/>
