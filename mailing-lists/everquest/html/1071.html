<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291845051">Is it better to build more than one character at a time? Mine is only <br/>
a level 6 halfling warrior, but I have invested quite a bit of time <br/>
in just getting this far. I know I can build another character a bit <br/>
faster based on what I have learned, but is that investment of time <br/>
worthwhile?<br/>
<br/>
I do have a second character just started, but that was only <br/>
something to play when the area my halfling was camped in was shut <br/>
down for repairs. I am thinking more on building a second character <br/>
for tactical purposes.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I wandered out of Rivervale to High Hold Pass one day, <br/>
and was slaughtered by Orcs. I managed to sneak back to recover my <br/>
stuff, but could not get out fast enough. I gave up that corpse, and <br/>
concentrated on building in Misty Thicket.<br/>
<br/>
My thought is to build a character over time just to get through High <br/>
Pass Hold. My greater interest is in the warrior working his way <br/>
across Misty Thicket. Am I wasting valuable game time on this second <br/>
character? High Pass Hold seems extremely difficult, and might not be <br/>
worth the effort until much later in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
