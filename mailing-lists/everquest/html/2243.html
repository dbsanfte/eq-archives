<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064207110">Thank you Hanna, Tracy and Bebbinn.<br/>
<br/>
 Cant belive now how stupid I was, had a whole stash of those leaves <br/>
banked away incase i needed them? for some reason had it in my head <br/>
the leaves were a ground spawn not a drop so never even gave them a <br/>
thought, DuH.And like Bebinn I am also enjoying all the quests .Cant <br/>
move on my computer desks for all these bits of paper with scrawled <br/>
notes on pottery , owl feathers and names and locs :0) I am Newcomer <br/>
to Everquest just started playing at the start of December and was <br/>
addicted the first day, and bought Luclin a few weeks ago and i am <br/>
happily frolicing round with my wee singing cat  though sadly my barb <br/>
shaman is gathering dust.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again all for the help :0)<br/>
Purrgara ....who cant see the tea for the leaves!!</div>
