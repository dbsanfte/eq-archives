<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893437247">I&#39;m afriad that the closest place is HighHold Pass. There you can find a number<br/>
of smithing supplies. However the journey is lonnnngggg and dangerous to under<br/>
9th level characters. Camo and Invis a great help. Take Qeynos Hills to west<br/>
karana to north karana to east karana and then to HighHold Pass and explore the<br/>
city. You could also go into the beholder maze if you and a 17+ character and<br/>
fight some mudites, they drop ore and clay.<br/>

&gt; I am a beginning smith based in Qeynos and i am having a great deal of<br/>
&gt; trouble finding ore near that city.  I was told that the closest place<br/>
&gt; to find ore was in the Dwarven area, but I find it hard to believe that<br/>
&gt; I would have to go that far!  Does anyone know of a place I can get ore<br/>
&gt; within 2or 3 zones of Qeynos?<br/>
