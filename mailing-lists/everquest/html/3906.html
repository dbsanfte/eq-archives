<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297070160">Luckily, or not, I was already an adult when D&D hit the scene.  Back <br/>
when there were no slick books or good dice.  Yeah, that long ago!  <br/>
So I&#39;ve heard all the stories.  A group was acting out D&D and <br/>
someone got injured and died.  A few killed themselves, and probably <br/>
would have regardless unfortunately.  It the same thing here. <br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m not encouraging you to tell your parents anything.  If <br/>
they&#39;re concerned they can check it out.  Parents need to know what <br/>
their children are doing, bottom line.  They need to find out for <br/>
themselves, not what a talking head told them.  To blame a computer <br/>
game for your life problems is silly, and typical in our society.  <br/>
Take responsibility for your life!<br/>

&gt; Yes I remember this happening. I was playing D&D at the time and <br/>
when <br/>
&gt; the story came out all the parents freaked out. We litterally had <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; hide our D&D stuff from our parents. This is an age old debate <br/>
&gt; whenther or not violence in TV, games, movies, ect cause violence. <br/>
&gt; Personally I believe that no they don&#39;t. The problem is already <br/>
there <br/>
&gt; in the persons mind. Really, think about it. If those mediums did <br/>
&gt; cause it then why don&#39;t we have more people going around squirting <br/>
&gt; others with water hoses? (Refrence to Super Mario Sunshine)<br/>

&gt; &gt;     This is the same thing that happened when Dungeons and <br/>
Dragons <br/>
&gt; frist<br/>
&gt; &gt; came out.  If you watched the program the lady saw the EQ game on <br/>
&gt; the scren<br/>
&gt; &gt; and jumped to the conclusion that he killed himself playing the <br/>
&gt; game.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; you listened to the program as well you would find out the man <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; severe<br/>
