<div id="ygrps-yiv-705652803">In Kelethin a similar way is to buy CB belts and turn them in in Kaladim.<br/>
But to get good skills, get in a group and fight on orc hill up to lvl 8<br/>
then go into CB.<br/>
Btw, anyone know of a good place a lvl 36 high elf cleric can solo?<br/>

&gt; Freeport and you can go from 1 to about 14 with enough belts in just a few<br/>
&gt; minutes LOL.  But your skills will suck so this isn&#39;t always a good thing<br/>

&gt; &gt; Trying to keep discussions alive........<br/>
&gt; &gt; What is a good way to level up fast.   Meaning, I see<br/>
&gt; &gt; people say things like I can get from level 3-6 in<br/>
&gt; &gt; around an hour.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, the other day, I was on 5 hours and just leveled<br/>
&gt; &gt; once.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a Newbie should we venture to more hostile grounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; with others to level?  Should we go to the same types<br/>
&gt; &gt; of places as a group but not form a group so I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; level faster?  Or just stay in the newbie area until<br/>
&gt; &gt; we get there?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Enough for now<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Later all helpfuls.....<br/>
