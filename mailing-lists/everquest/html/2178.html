<b>Subject:</b> To cure or not to cure...? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000289726">Hello,<br/>
  I play a level 16 barbarian shaman, and lately ive been trying to <br/>
fight and level in Oasis of Marr.  Usually im in a group, and as <br/>
happens when fighiting in Oasis, usually one or more of my party <br/>
members gets rabies or is poisoned by whatever mob we are fighting at <br/>
the time.  Since as a shaman i have Cure Disease (which cures rabies) <br/>
and Cure Poison, i keep them memmed so that if a party member is <br/>
poisoned or becomes rabid, i can cure them (most of the time, it <br/>
works on the first cast, the second one if nothing else).  The other <br/>
day, i was grouped with two gnomes, one a warrior and the other... i <br/>
cant remember, but he was a gnome too, and another barbarian.  We <br/>
were fighting a madman or zombie or something like that, and everyone <br/>
but me got rabies.  I healed the barbarian of it no sweat, but i used <br/>
up my entire mana bar trying to heal the gnomes!  For some reason, it <br/>
wouldnt work, no matter how many times i cast it!  So i went to the <br/>
dock and there were some other random people that were rabid too, and <br/>
i healed them without a problem, but i still couldnt heal the <br/>
gnomes!! Should i report this as a bug or is this just something that <br/>
is the norm?  Help on this matter would be appreciated!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you sooooo much,<br/>
