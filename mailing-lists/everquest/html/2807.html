&gt; They are kept on the server for 3 months, then deleted there after.  Gives<br/>
&gt; you time to change your mind.  That&#39;s at least how the policy stood when I<br/>
&gt; was a guide, may have changed since.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While the policy is that they keep the characters for 3 months, Verant has<br/>
*never* actually followed thru with that policy.  The only &quot;mass deletion&quot;<br/>
of characters was before Luclin when they deleted lvl 1 chars from every<br/>
account.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known people gone for a year that have reactivated their accounts and<br/>
their characters were there.<br/>
