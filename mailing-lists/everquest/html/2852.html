<b>Subject:</b> what good is a 40 shaman? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-965289536">No, I am not selling this account for money. <br/>
But I have a 40 shaman account (on the nameless server) and am done <br/>
with it. I do not want to keep paying for it, as I never use it, but <br/>
I feel funny about just letting itdie. So, I&#39;d like someone that <br/>
could use it to take it over. Now, I am looking for some sort of <br/>
compensation. NO real money, but a donation to my guild in the way of <br/>
platinum or gear would be well considered. Do not ask me how much or <br/>
what items  I don&#39;t know. If you are interested, just send an email <br/>
to me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:z_elder@...">z_elder@...</a> saying &quot;I would like to donate 25k to your <br/>
cause in exchange for the account&quot;  or whatever.</div>
