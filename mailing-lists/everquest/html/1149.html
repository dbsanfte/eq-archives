yeah, people pulling dvinn and the other Tower trash tend to clear out the<br/>
zone real fast.<br/>
That reminds me, there&#39;s an npc in Northern Ro named Dorn B&#39;Dynn... He is<br/>
supposedy lvl 16. But that is total BS. He cons green to a level 20. He<br/>
waaaaaaay undercons. You need like a lvl 40 druid or something to snare the<br/>
bastard bc he resists root to lvl 20s. Sometimes he resists root from higher<br/>
lvls too. Or it will say he&#39;s rooted and he&#39;ll still be moving. This bastard<br/>
hits hard too. I logged in to EQ one time and before I had fully logged he<br/>
was already attacking me. At lvl 20 I hit him once. He hit me 20 times in a<br/>
row. I was dead in about 30 seconds. I&#39;m willing to bet he&#39;s actually the<br/>
same lvl as Dvinn.<br/>
Oh, and over lvl 20, Highkeep is a great place to hunt. I got 2 lvls in one<br/>
day.<br/>
luv,<br/>
