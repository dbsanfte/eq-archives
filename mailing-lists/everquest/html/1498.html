<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Great EQ Computer? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193140460">I went out and bought a system from www.alienware.com.  It was highly<br/>
recommeneded from the EQ boards (before it became moderated).  I called <br/>
them up and asked for specific details on the motherboard, chips, etc, then<br/>
searched the web on these parts and found they were all highly rated. <br/>
The vid card is a GeForce made especially for them by Nvidia, so there&#39;s<br/>
no brand name (creative, gulliomont, ect) to it.  <br/>
<br/>
The system I got was a 1.2 Ghz T-Bird, with all the trimmings.  My previous<br/>
system was a AMD 300, with a 16meg TNT Card. :)  Played for almost 2 years<br/>
on that system.  Needed to upgrade when we started to hunt deeper into<br/>
Kunark.  I was playing a cleric at the time and I was lagging in the <br/>
timing for heals.  That is NOT a good thing.   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, i&#39;m very happy with the system.  I loaded every high perf game I<br/>
can get my hands on, and it hasn&#39;t missed a beat.  Oh, and the most important<br/>
thing is that it hasn&#39;t crashed once in EQ (Old world, kunark, velious). Runs<br/>
smoooooth as silk with all settings MAXED (clipping, particles, resolution, etc).<br/>
The best part is that it runs all the games with out problems straight out<br/>
of the box! Just plug it in, load it up, and go.  <br/>
<br/>
One caveat, when you order the system, it takes about 3-4 weeks to get to you. <br/>
I ordered mine a week before xmas, and didn&#39;t get it until mid januaray.  If<br/>
you got patients, its well worth it.  If not, grab the list of parts they use<br/>
and build your own or find a local shop that can custom build it for ya. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good luck.  I plan on purchasing another one from them for my GF. <br/>
She uses a pent3 -650, asus mb, asus geforce 2 64m card, and EQ crashes way <br/>
too often on her system.  I&#39;ve tried everything to get her system stable, <br/>
but to no avail.  <br/>
