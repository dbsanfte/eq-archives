<div id="ygrps-yiv-118153271">I am rather new to the game, but one of the things that fascinates me <br/>
is the real sense of danger when I put my character in a new <br/>
situation. Heart pounds, pulse rate goes up, I even get the shakes <br/>
sometimes. I seldom get that in real life, even though I have a job <br/>
that requires occasional physical combat.<br/>
<br/>
I love this game!<br/>

He just <br/>

dumb luck.  <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s a 30 mage now, was 28 then and everything he passed was <br/>
conning red to <br/>

&gt; &gt; Speaking of porting...how can I get a port to Kunark?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Not Dreadlands...but closer to Cabilis<br/>
&gt; &gt; and without taking the barrel barge?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; is there anywhere else that will get me into Kunark besides one <br/>
of the boats<br/>
&gt; &gt; or the DL port...please<br/>
