You have to do this quest twice to get 2 carapaces.....then smith the<br/>
carapaces with a tunic mold and nepeta oil, sold by Chialle near the bridge<br/>
to shadeweavers, to make the bloodling mail.<br/>
Hand the tunic to Barkem to get the first hammer. Then you are assigned the<br/>
task of repairing the bridge guard shields.  Ask Barkem [What repair order]<br/>
to get the order, then head to one of the two guards at the end of each<br/>
bridge, Shadeweavers and Hollowshade.  Handing them the order gets you their<br/>
shield. Take the shield and hammer and combine in a forge to get the<br/>
repaired shield, then hand the shield back to its owner before he respawns.<br/>
he will hand you a letter.  Once you do all 4 guards, the 2 at the end of<br/>
shadeweavers and the 2 at the end of hollowshade, you will then be given an<br/>
anvil and told to make shadow disks.  To make the disks you combine 1<br/>
swirling shadow with 1 metal bit in a forge with the hammer and anvil.<br/>
Barkem will hand you a box to put 10 in.  After that, you move on to the<br/>
humming orbs.  Handing Barkem 3 orbs plus your hammer gets you the hammer<br/>
used to make shadowscream armor.<br/>
<br/>
As for the substances, that requires running the war of hollowshade.  the<br/>
basics of the war is this.......<br/>
Each camp has a trigger, for the grimling camp in the south its the Grimling<br/>
Chief, for the wolves east cave its Ghowlik, and for the owlbears its the<br/>
named in back of the caves (was never good at remembering the bear<br/>
names....so oddballed.)  Killing this trigger usually sets off the enemy to<br/>
attack them.  The war moves in one direction...the mobs controling the north<br/>
cave always attacks the south camp, south camp always attacks the east cave,<br/>
and east cave always attacks the north cave.  So to get a mob you want in<br/>
control of one area, you need to get them to the attacking camp, then<br/>
trigger them to attack the one you want them at.  Once a mob controls 2<br/>
camps however, if they are attacked they do not spawn defenders in the camp<br/>
under attack.  The substances you want will drop off the owlbears and sonic<br/>
wolves once they take the south camp area, rarely they drop off the others<br/>
but its a once in a 100 kills.  South camp kills are one almost every other<br/>
kill.  The wolves drop Shrieking substances, looks like a blueish green<br/>
rock, and the owlbears drop wailing substances, looks like an orange orb.<br/>
Combine 1 each of the substances with the hammer, anvil, one metal ring, and<br/>
water to make the orb, then combine the right number of orbs, swirling<br/>
shadows, and mold to make shadowscream armor.<br/>
