    <div style="FONT:10pt arial;">I remembr the werewolves in West Commons, I 
    was still very young then and they were all very red to me.&nbsp; Then, a 
    younger yellow werewolf attacked me.&nbsp; I felt so proud to be included in 
    the event, till a higher level character came along and killed it and looted 
    it.&nbsp; </div>
    <div style="FONT:10pt arial;">I have yet to ever obtain anything from any GM 
    event.&nbsp; The higher level characters flock to the events in droves, and 
    those less than 65th level don&#39;t have a chanch.&nbsp; </div>
    <div style="FONT:10pt arial;">Yes, they are different, and some items can 
    only be obtained thru these events.&nbsp; But don&#39;t expect, as I did, to be 
    able to do anything but watch.&nbsp; I have been to several now.....snow in 
    the Oasis of Marr, a dragon at Kurn&#39;s Castle, a huge God in Freeport, even 
    the war at the entrance to Surefall.&nbsp; All are intresting, but only 
    that.&nbsp; The mobs of higher level characters will be at every one of 
    them, and those of us that aren&#39;t part of that elite crowd, are just 
    spectators.</div>

    <div><br></div><tt>Since we are in a story telling mood, and to get some 
    things jump <br>started, I though I&#39;d ask this.&nbsp; Do you remember your 
    first GM <br>event?&nbsp; Or even the most memorable.&nbsp; <br><br>Now I 
    know some of you are asking what are those!&nbsp; Back in the olden <br>days 
    of Everquest, before the new planes were revealed, before the <br>Nexus 
    opened and the moon Luclin moved closer to us, before the great <br>ice 
    sheet that is Velious was found there were mythical beings that <br>walked 
    the land called GM&#39;s.&nbsp; On certain occasions they would come <br>down to 
    the lands of Norrath and alter them.&nbsp; Sometimes they played <br>tricks, 
    or reset a zone to their own liking.&nbsp; Some of you may have 
    <br>experienced this over Christmas, or during Halloween.<br><br>When 
    Tuldayen was a young and very inexperienced Ranger roaming the <br>hills 
    around Qeynos he was involved in such an event.&nbsp; He awoke one 
    <br>morning to find himself in the quiet of Surefall Glade.&nbsp; He took up 
    <br>his trusty Hickory Bow and sheathed his now only tarnished long sword 
    <br>and ventured out into the still unfamiliar hills.&nbsp; But when he 
    <br>entered the tunnel he was met by several of the evil undead.&nbsp; He 
    was <br>lucky enough to jump back into the protection of the glade and 
    <br>avoided death.&nbsp; He thought to himself &quot;where are those guards&quot; and 
    <br>ventured out again.<br><br>He was amazed by what he found.&nbsp; The sky 
    was a deep red, blood red.&nbsp; <br>The entire land was filled with all 
    manner of Skeletons.&nbsp; Many were <br>familiar to him, but many more were 
    not and some were 30 feet tall!&nbsp; <br>It was as if the ancient 
    battlefields of Norrath had spilled their <br>dead on the land.&nbsp; Then 
    he heard the wails of Varsoon the undying and <br>saw great magicks near the 
    ruins.&nbsp; He ran for his life toward the <br>City of Qeynos.&nbsp; When 
    he looked back there were a dozen of the evil <br>creatures behind 
    him.&nbsp; He made it to the city and found many like <br>him.&nbsp; Parties 
    were formed and we headed back to the hills to destroy <br>what evil we 
    could.&nbsp; Oh, many of us fell that day.&nbsp; We had the good <br>fortune 
    to have obtained a bind in the city.&nbsp; Experience was gained <br>and 
    lost, many of us found better weapons amongst the shattered bones <br>and 
    plenty of gold was found.<br><br>Eventually the hills filled with powerful 
    adventurers and the Guilds <br>called upon their members to gather for the 
    war.&nbsp; The Undead War <br>raged for days in the hills around Qeynos 
    until at last enough blood <br>had been spilled to satisify any God.&nbsp; 
    Or GM! ;)<br><br>This was a 1-35 event that went for 8 actual hours.&nbsp; 
    Tell us your <br>story, and I&#39;ll tell you about day werewolves ravaged the 
    West <br>Commonlands!<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage
