<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote TYPE="CITE" style="BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;">I popped into SK to try to pick up a few plat on gnolls or aviaks, <br>
but intercepted a call for a named char location. I got it on track <br>
and responded. I lead a group hunting a rare drop to their quarry, <br>
and made 50pp plus in tips. Took maybe five minutes.<br>
<br>
A short time later I am in the tunnel mouth of ec to sell some of the <br>
loot given as tips, when a player asked for a port. Having done very <br>
well I felt generous, so did a free port to bb. In bb I got a call <br>
for a wc port, party of two. Did the job. 100pp tip. Not bad at all. <br>
My most profitable session yet. It was quite fun.<br>
