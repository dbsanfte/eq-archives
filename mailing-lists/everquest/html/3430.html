I find the best places for xp as a dark, bearing in mind I have limited<br/>
choices on a pvp server so I probably miss out on some of the best haunts,<br/>
at 52 is Skyfire Mountains and Chardok both on Kunark. Also Sol B on the<br/>
mainland is still good there if you can get a beetle group or maybe even a<br/>
fire giant group there. The Hole on Odus and Cobalt Scar on Velious would<br/>
also be good exp at that level I think.<br/>

<br/>
  Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place to hunt<br/>
to<br/>
  get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>
  Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the other<br/>
  parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is there..<br/>
  does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I<br/>
will<br/>
  hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to<br/>
zone<br/>
  beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the<br/>
higher<br/>
  lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>
  Any suggestions?<br/>
  luv,<br/>
