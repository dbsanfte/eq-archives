<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941013000">Hail, All.<br/>
<br/>
I am a Half Elf Ranger of the 11th season, a faithful member of the <br/>
guild Legendary Legacy, and a Protector of the Pine on the Druzzil <br/>
Ro server.  I&#39;m having some trouble and need advice on the following:<br/>
<br/>
1.) I am &quot;solo&quot;-ing bandits in Western Karana for the xp and <br/>
sashes.  I am pulling one or two at time and most con white or dark <br/>
blue to me.  The problem is the bandit casters that con dark blue <br/>
are kicking my butt.  Any Advice?<br/>
<br/>
2.) I am trying to procure a perfect quality bear skin for the cape <br/>
quest.  I took about 25 brown and grizzly bears last night, and <br/>
didn&#39;t get a single one.  Any advice on which drops them more <br/>
frequently or how rare they are?<br/>
<br/>
3.) Finally, what are there yellow and red cons that I may be able <br/>
to take down at this level?  I am extremely anxious to reach the <br/>
15th season and get my dual wield.  I have pretty decent gear <br/>
courtesy of my guild-mates.  Any pointers would be great.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I am particularly interested in taking down the werewolf that <br/>
roams WK.  He&#39;s snuck up on me and offed me 3 times now.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
Jaxun</div>
