<div id="ygrps-yiv-176925886">To be perfectly honest and use a busines mentality.<br/>
I think EQII and EQ will reside in paralell for a bit<br/>
of time , however, I am sure the long term goal as<br/>
well as cost will be to move to EQII and make the<br/>
original game legacy.<br/>
<br/>
The cost for hosting these servers as well as the<br/>
Hardware costs , depreciation, etc will make Sony take<br/>
a proactive approach to reducing costs and increasing<br/>
sales and margins.<br/>
<br/>
That said, the length of time for the reduction of EQ<br/>
could be based upon the gameplay and or differences.<br/>
Let me explain.  If you have tried Star Wars Galaxies<br/>
you will know what I mean.  There is a strong emphasis<br/>
on Player economy as well as a SIM CITY feel.  You can<br/>
now create players cities, run businesses ,etc.<br/>
<br/>
If EQII takes on this style of play, I am sure there<br/>
will be a BUY in time to this new style of game. <br/>
Granted they can&#39;t lose the traditional Fantasy<br/>
Dungeon personae of an RPG but they can enhance it to<br/>
make the game more Role Playing with the ability to<br/>
help write a storyline, as well as make typical<br/>
dungeon crawls.<br/>
<br/>
I tried SWG for 2 months when it was released and<br/>
loved it.  I prefer Fantasy genre material so I ended<br/>
up back in EQ for a few reasons.  However, for those<br/>
of you who have tried SWG, I can say that some new<br/>
features in EQ have been derived from the SWG<br/>
interface.  For example, the new targetting feature. <br/>
It is not identical but is similar in the objective.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, the LDoN expansion is very similar to taking<br/>
missions in SWG.  You can enter an area where only<br/>
your group is in the Dungeon.  This is typical to a<br/>
Traditional D&D adventure with a small party.  In SWG,<br/>
you can take missions based upon the groups abilites<br/>
and skills (levels).  Then you venture out to complete<br/>
the mission givin to you.<br/>
<br/>
In summary, I think EQII will be the next generation<br/>
of MMORPG&quot;s that will bring a more Role playing<br/>
ability to a game along with a player controlled<br/>
economy.  Sim city meets D&D, maybe , but if you have<br/>
tried SWG and play EQ as well, I think you will agree<br/>
with most of what I said.  <br/>
<br/>
I also see some of these new features recently<br/>
implemented is a test-bed, if you will, of ideas they<br/>
have for EQII to see how the population reacts to the<br/>
changes.  Hence, LDoN, Targetting screen, Journal<br/>
storylines, etc.<br/>
<br/>
well, nuff spam , hope you enjoy<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I do wonder how many people will jump to EQ2 when<br/>
&gt; it comes out. I<br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t even know myself if I will move or stick<br/>
&gt; here. Sometimes I feel<br/>
&gt;   like moving, sometimes I want to keep at this<br/>
&gt; version. I seem to be<br/>
&gt;   playing less and less, for various reasons. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It would be nice to get in on the beginning of the<br/>
&gt; game. Be part of<br/>
&gt;   the discovery, part of a new economy. On the other<br/>
&gt; hand, I have spent<br/>
&gt;   two years on this game, and there is a lot<br/>
&gt; invested in the original<br/>
&gt;   version. Not to mention that only recently did my<br/>
&gt; son get a computer<br/>
&gt;   able to play the full game in all it&#39;s glory.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Still a decision for the future. May be that we<br/>
&gt; will have accounts in<br/>
&gt;   both games, though where I will get the time to<br/>
&gt; play on both I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   know. I don&#39;t retire for at least seven more<br/>
&gt; years. Now then I shall<br/>
&gt;   become a full-time gamer. Oh, yeah!<br/>

&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;     Would buying EQ be worth it right now<br/>
&gt; considering that EQ2 is<br/>
&gt;   coming out in February or March?  I bought EQ in<br/>
&gt; july for about 50<br/>
&gt;   bucks and a month later they came out with the<br/>
&gt; package deal that had<br/>
&gt;   all expansions except LDON and it also had loy in<br/>
&gt; it which i stil<br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t have for 30 bucks.  Of course thats the<br/>
&gt; gaming industry way hehe.   <br/>
