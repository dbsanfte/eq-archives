<b>Subject:</b> Hi, I am new & stupid :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048515952">I have a brand spankin&#39; new rogue and I have some questions.  I would<br/>
greatly appreciate any feedback.<br/>
<br/>
1)  How does &quot;sneak&quot; work exactly?  Can I sneak across someone&#39;s line of<br/>
sight?  What is the difference between &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; that comes later?<br/>
<br/>
2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.  Does it do me any good to<br/>
attack monsters from behind without the ability yet?  I have been making an<br/>
effort to do just that, but should I not even bother?<br/>
<br/>
3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot recall<br/>
having ever seen or heard of a trap in EQ.  Can anyone give an example of<br/>
where and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>
there is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>
<br/>
