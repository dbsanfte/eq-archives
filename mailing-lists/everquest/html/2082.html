  I&#39;ve had this happen to me as well.  It&#39;s NOT possible for others to loot<br/>
or drag your corpse unless you give them permission using the /consent<br/>
command.<br/>
<br/>
  More likely what&#39;s happened is that your corpse is inside a tree or object<br/>
or even slightly underground.  If you have the /loc where you died, stand<br/>
there and use the /corpse command which will summon it to you (if you&#39;re<br/>
close enough).  If you don&#39;t know where it is, try gaining the help of a<br/>
necromancer or bard, they have the ability to locate corpses.<br/>
<br/>
  You can also buy a Chipped Bone Rod in Felwithe (I don&#39;t remember which<br/>
shop, sorry), when used, this item will point you towards the closest corpse<br/>
you have in the zone you&#39;re in.  You can then run in that direction until<br/>
you get close enough to summon it with /corpse.<br/>

    Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
    Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th level Druid in the city<br/>
of Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, with others, I got killed by an Orc<br/>
Centurian and when I returned to get my corpse, nothing was there.  It was<br/>
not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>
<br/>
    Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my corpse? The<br/>
book says no but I beg to differ.<br/>
    Is it possible that I had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I went<br/>
back with a dead body I died again?  Which meant I found the wrong corpse?<br/>
<br/>
    And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have no<br/>
food, no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I beg or do I start another char?<br/>
    This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to learn which way<br/>
to go all the time and dying, it is starting to get to me,<br/>
    I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since the<br/>
Chat from the game options was USELESS.<br/>
<br/>
    Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>
<br/>
