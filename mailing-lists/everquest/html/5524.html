Good post the zone you were missing the name of is Netherbian Lair.  <br/>
I think thats spelled right.  And once you have done your time in <br/>
Meru Seru you can head over to Dawn Shroud Peaks.  You go straight <br/>
at the big junction rather than right coming from the nexus.  That <br/>
should take you in to you mid to late 30&#39;s...If i remember right.<br/>
<br/>
Karudore,<br/>
BTW, great choice of a new class for ya.  I play a 65 shaman on The <br/>
Tribunal and i love it.<br/>

&gt; welcome back..  You can get to level 7 in steam front killing <br/>
&gt; kobolds.. then go behind the windmills to reach level 10.. at 10 <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; your gear is ok.. nothing great... head over to kurns tower till <br/>
&gt; around 16 or 17.. then after that head over to pauladal caverns <br/>
&gt; &lt;sp&gt;  good to level 24 at least.. after that go to the caverns <br/>
&gt; between nexus and dawn shroud peaks.&lt;forget the name sorry&gt;  that <br/>
&gt; get you to 27 maybe 28. after that go to marus saru till 30 then <br/>
&gt; head over to split paw till 34...  thats a good way to solo <br/>
without <br/>
&gt; being PLed.. But if you have LDON  at level 20 try to get groups <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; there.. not bad loot and great exp and fun..  Hope that helps <br/>
some.. <br/>
&gt; good hunting...  <br/>

&gt; &gt; I have recently (taday actually) renewed my EQ fascination <br/>
&gt; &gt; (addiction?). In my previous EQ days ( I quit right after PoP <br/>
came <br/>
&gt; &gt; out) I played strictly melee characters....had a 57th lvl Barb <br/>
&gt; &gt; Warrior, and a 59th lvl Hum Monk. I got tired of the endless <br/>
&gt; &gt; searching for groups, and the seeming HUGE overload of really <br/>
well <br/>
&gt; &gt; equipped melees on my server (Tunare) so this time around I <br/>
&gt; decided <br/>
&gt; &gt; to go with a high demand class, and finally, after much <br/>
&gt; &gt; consideration, I decided to play the class I most loved duoing <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; as a monk, the Shaman. I rolled up a Barb Shaman with my new EQ <br/>
&gt; &gt; Evolutions software, and -pop- there I was, back in Halas again <br/>
&gt; after <br/>
&gt; &gt; nearly a yeas absence. A lot of things came back to me, and <br/>
within <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; couple of hours, I hit lvl 5, got my new spells, and then I hit <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; brick wall. Non of my old friends seem to be around anymore, so <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have them to ask for advice, so I turned to this group for <br/>
&gt; &gt; help. I have been told Steamfront is the best place to go to lvl <br/>
&gt; up a <br/>
&gt; &gt; shammy for the next few cycles anyway...any thoughts on this? I <br/>
am <br/>
&gt; &gt; not looking to necessarily powerlevel, though I do miss the high <br/>
&gt; end <br/>
&gt; &gt; raiding, pulling in Kael , the 12 hour raids in HoT in ToV, etc <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; would like to get back to those, but I am willing to put in the <br/>
&gt; time <br/>
&gt; &gt; to learn this classes ins and outs, and make myself an integral <br/>
&gt; part <br/>
&gt; &gt; of any group I join. So any help with where to level, etc would <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; &gt; great, since it has been since early 2001 that I was a newbie <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; first time.........and the old haunts seem to be deserted now. I <br/>
&gt; do <br/>
&gt; &gt; like the new transport systems, made getting out of Halas much <br/>
&gt; easier <br/>
&gt; &gt; than it was with my warrior ( the run to Freeport with a lvl 5 <br/>
&gt; &gt; nightblind warrior in cloth armor was harrowing lol) ...also if <br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone has a main or an alt on Tunare that would like to group <br/>
&gt; with a <br/>
&gt; &gt; n00b shammy and help him get the hang of it all, send a tell to <br/>
&gt; &gt; Karudore  ..... see you all soon.<br/>
