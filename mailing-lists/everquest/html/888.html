<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710347408">My friend.. she has to go back to Oggok.  Just plan out her levels when she<br/>
needs to train and take trips back for training purposes.  Since most skills<br/>
require only 1 point normally it works out just fine.<br/>
<br/>
I once tried that on a PVP Team server.   Ran my lvl one troll through the<br/>
swamp - sro - oasis - nro - ecommons - nek forest to find out nobody would<br/>
train me =(.  Oh well..  There might be some way to train it up, or gain<br/>
enough faction to.  However most of those factions require quest - from<br/>
those that dont like you in the first place.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Ogre faction and training near freeport?<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
 <br/>
  I just got a friend into EQ (Is it just me or does anyone else seem to <br/>
picture that Truth tobacco commercial ads with body bags whenever you <br/>
introduce a new victu...er, player to EQ? &gt;:-) ).  She&#39;s decided to start<br/>
an Ogre warrioress with green hair (She liked the green hair for some<br/>
reason),<br/>
and I brought her all the way to freeport.  <br/>
 <br/>
  Since i&#39;ve never played an evil factioned race before, i have no idea<br/>
where<br/>
she should go to train her skills.  We found she can get into Neriak to<br/>
buy/sell<br/>
and bank, but the warriors guild there won&#39;t train her.  We also tried that<br/>
<br/>
barbarian warrior under east freeport.  <br/>
 <br/>
  Does any know where she can train near Neriak or freeport? Or does she<br/>
have<br/>
to travel all the way back to Ogguk?  Also any tips on what she can do to<br/>
help<br/>
her faction so she can get into the freeport city would be appreciated! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
