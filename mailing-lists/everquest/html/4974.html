think you&#39;re right about KS&#39;ing, I may add if someone looks like they are 
waiting for a spawn, and you find out they are, taking it would be a KS 
IMHO.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t played in a while, do people still do camp checks when 
they enter a zone?</font></span></div>

 size="2">I personally don&#39;t think you did anything wrong..you basically pulled 
  for camp 1 even though you did not mean to and all the group did was let you 
  get pounded so you&nbsp;ran off to save your life which is what I would of 
  done in that situation.&nbsp; That group might of all been afk&nbsp;(doubt it) 
  and when they got back on they thought&nbsp;that you trained them on 
  purpose...but anyway if all their gonna do in the game is cause you problems 
  then they are all immature and don&#39;t have much of a life.&nbsp; If it happens 
  again you should take a screen shot of what they said and tell a gm about 
  it..if he asks for the proof then you have it all right there...it&#39;ll take 
  like a week to get a response back but thats the only sure way to take care of 
  this problem...that or either ignore them.&nbsp; This kind of thing happened 
  to me in Echo Caverns..I was wondering around looking for a spot to solo when 
  this needlite comes out and attacks me from behind.&nbsp; I see a group of 3 
  people nearby in the needlite camp and I tell them I have a mob for you guys 
  but all they did was sit there.they had no mobs in their area.&nbsp; I tell 
  them again but I still get no response.&nbsp; By this time I lost about 2 bubs 
  of health so I said screw it and killed it off.&nbsp; Later I get a shout 
  telling everyone in the zone I am a KSer..now let me get this right isn&#39;t 
  KSing killing a mob that someone else is already fighting?&nbsp; Or am I 
  wrong?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span><br><br><span class="ygrps-yiv-158831745635303407-21082003"><font

  have been playing EQ for about 2 years and enjoying every min. <br>of <br>&gt; 
  it. I play for only about 1 to 2 hours a day (maybe) so I really <br>get 
  <br>&gt; in to my time in the game. This sunday something new happened to 
  <br>me.<br>&gt; I have a 24th level Bar. shaman and have been grouping in Pav. 
  <br>&gt; Caverns to work up in levels. I logged on and ooc&#39;ed asking to 
  <br>group. <br>&gt; I got not responce. I went to camp 1 aqnd found a good 
  mixed group <br>&gt; working it very well (8 people mixed classes teaming very 
  nicely) <br>so <br>&gt; I went to camp 2, There were 5 people 3 casters (2 
  mages and a <br>necro) <br>&gt; a ranger and a fighter) all around 19 to 20., 
  all at 100% health. <br>I <br>&gt; asked if they wanted a healer/buffer and 
  got &quot;Shouted down&quot; &quot;This <br>&gt; Camp is TAKEN GO AWAY&quot;!!!....ok so I truned 
  and started back. I <br>got <br>&gt; jumped by 3 of the bandits. I Camp was 
  not doing anything so I <br>pulled <br>&gt; the mobs back in to the camp and 
  ooced here is your mobs take them <br>I <br>&gt; don&#39;t want to steal your 
  kills(all the time I am getting <br>pounded) .. <br>&gt; no one said anything 
  so I ran .. about 1/2 way back I get <br>ooc&#39;ed &quot;WTF <br>&gt; Frezz wait...&quot; 
  as I as all ready near the cave to SH and the zone <br>I <br>&gt; just left... 
  the &quot;group&quot; because of 5 mobs brok camp and ran (as <br>they <br>&gt; ran they 
  pulled 2 more) and &quot;telled&quot; me to death about how they <br>were <br>&gt; going 
  to cause me problems every time they see me and ect...<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; A. did I do wrong by trying to &quot;not steal&quot; the camp&#39;s mobs<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; b. what do I do about the &quot;problems&quot; I might have later by thes 
  <br>&gt; people?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; I like doing the right thing 
  and playing with people not causeing <br>&gt; problems for others...<br>&gt;
