<div id="ygrps-yiv-484024508">Anyone find any other brewers recipes other than Ale, Mead, Ogre Swill, <br/>
Ol&#39;Tujim&#39;s Fierce Brew, Short Ale, Short Beer and Tumpy Tonic? There are <br/>
grapes and wine yeasts which leads me to suspect that there&#39;s more recipes <br/>
still yet to be discovered, but I&#39;ve been unable to figure them out.</div>
