<div><font size="2">I had to wait nearly&nbsp;4 days to get a surname request 
petition answered. Several times I petitioned then waited 3, 4 hours for a 
response, and nothing. I finally got a guide to help me set the surname (which 
was rejected with the /surname command) after about 7 petitions. Now, I realize 
a lowly 20&#39;s surname isn&#39;t the most important petition around, but once a guide 
got to it, it took, maybe 30 seconds? He ported in to where I was in SK, set it, 
asked if it was right,&nbsp;I told him yes and thanked him, and he was back to 
whatever guides and gm&#39;s do. I&#39;m not blaming the poor guide for taking so long 
to get to it, but surely VI could get a few more ppl, maybe devote some to 
hacking only,&nbsp;one or two to player assistance like surnames, and weddings, 
some to item losses due to bugs and maybe corpses in the wall or landscape, some 
to players cheating/stealing from others. That way hopefully it would all go a 
bit faster, and those with small things could get them dealt with as quickly as 
the bigger, more time consuming things like watching train pullers and 
investigating losses/thefts </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>I must say, I think the new policy is rather silly... a 
  true case of<br>throwing the baby out with the bath water (it&#39;s an old saying 
  okay?&nbsp; Seems<br>to fit here)<br><br>Verant must want a lot of people 
  available when Star Wars Galaxies comes<br>online.&nbsp; Or Anarchy 
  online.<br><br>When calculating the cost of their crappy customer service I 
  sure hope<br>they&#39;re not taking into account the fees of the amateur guides 
  who would<br>normally be paying to play EQ.&nbsp; And yes, I consider any 
  company who makes<br>you wait up to three hours just to *answer* a complaint 
  crappy... if you get<br>an answer at all.&nbsp; Apparently /petition requests 
  get purged from the lists<br>if they sit there more than 3 hours.&nbsp; Would 
  you sit on hold on the phone for<br>three hours with or without an 800 
  line?&nbsp; I sure wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>My guild has people who are also 
  interested in playing other MMORPG&#39;s, some<br>of us are in Beta for Anarchy 
  Online, and believe you me, if enough of us<br>are interested we&#39;ll be porting 
  the guild over to a new game.&nbsp; Why stay with<br>a company who assumes we 
  are guilty or too stupid to own an account?&nbsp; Plus<br>if you share a PC, 
  or are on a home network and are connected to the PC of<br>someone who is NOT 
  computer savvy, you are also vulnerable.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think<br>the average 
  home user should have an MS Certification in Network<br>administration just to 
  play a game.<br><br>Kellee<br>Tunare Server<br>Diela, 26 Bard<br>Diablesse, 14

  transfer my stuff from my<br>&gt; hacked account<br>&gt; to a new account that 
  I create?? The attitude of you just get banned and<br>&gt; lose everything 
  that you&#39;ve worked hard for PERIOD really is a<br>&gt; poor customer<br>&gt; 
  service attitude for something that we pay monthly to 
  do.<br>&gt;<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
