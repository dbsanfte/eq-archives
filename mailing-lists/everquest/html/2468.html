<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] gforce 2 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083473503"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have an Nvidia tnt2 64 graphics card. PCI. I have seen the gforce 2<br/>
&gt; for about $45. I am wondering if I can expect much improved<br/>
&gt; performance with the gforce 2. Both are pci, both 32k. I get lots of<br/>
&gt; lag in Rivervale, most of Luclin, and some of the other cities. Not<br/>
&gt; everywhere, just where lots of people gather and the backgrounds are<br/>
&gt; graphics intensive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm.. I have a GEForce 2 MX 64. Not sure about the 32. The 64 works fine for<br/>
me.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have the money to go for the gforce 3, and I don&#39;t even know<br/>
&gt; if the 3 comes in pci format. I need another hard disk as well as<br/>
&gt; doing a graphics upgrade, so the money needs to stay around that $45.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my bro has geforce 3 and says it&#39;s awesome. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s PCI. they<br/>
probably have for both PCI and AGP.<br/>
You might want to check www.pricegrabber.com to see if you can find a good<br/>
price. Compare that to www.pricewatch.com as well.<br/>
Oh, and if you want a product review, you can also try www.epinions.com<br/>
I found those 3 very useful in finding myself a new modem and sound card.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I would want a very obvious improvement to even bother with the<br/>
&gt; upgrade on the graphics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think one of those websites listed lets you compare two of the products...<br/>
so you can look for your current one and compare it with a potential card.<br/>
