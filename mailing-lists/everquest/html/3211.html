<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Most people play in places like the Overthere so 
they don&#39;t die and lose all their equipment deep in some dungeon where they 
can&#39;t get to it. I have never really gotten into guilds personally which has 
always kind of bothered me. I guess my goals now are to get to level 46 and 
participate in&nbsp;my first&nbsp;dragon raid. </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings 
  toward game <br>death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s 
  attitudes <br>toward game death?<br><br>I play solo most of the time, and 
  haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on <br>since Wave of Change faded away. So, 
  death, especially death in <br>awkward circumstances, is more serious to my 
  character. I can&#39;t just <br>call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of 
  the grave, nor do&nbsp; <br>have high level guildies to drag my corpse out 
  from under some big <br>nasty.<br><br>My son-in-law plays with abandon. He 
  leaves corpses all over the <br>place, joins groups readily, and seems to have 
  great fun doing all <br>that.<br><br>My son, on the other hand, is in a 
  powerful guild on our server. He <br>is less cautious than me, but still uses 
  sound strategy and tactics <br>and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. 
  His guild is the <br>Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br><br>I figure I will have to 
  do the guild and group thing soon, but enjoy <br>my independence enough that I 
  want to do so as late in my career as <br>possible. <br><br>Barto Proudfoot
