My friend and I are trying this combo. Although, I<br/>
like the Ranger combo a lot.  Here is what we play for<br/>
a three person, Druid, Ranger, Dwarf Paladin.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, the twosome......Magician and Monk.  I know, I<br/>
know, no healing......so it is not the best but a nice<br/>
POWER combination.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &quot;correct&quot; answers too, is what 2<br/>
&gt; classes make the best DUO team.  I wont say what is<br/>
&gt; best because I guess it<br/>
&gt; might boil down to two players that play well<br/>
&gt; together and not depend on<br/>
&gt; their class too much (par from two straight melee). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My favorite?  Ranger + Enchanter.  Outdoor zones<br/>
&gt; fights go something like<br/>
&gt; this enchanter tashs with beserker up or whatever<br/>
&gt; dmg absorb spell they have<br/>
&gt; for that lvl.  As enchanter is casting tash he runs<br/>
&gt; at the mob while the<br/>
&gt; ranger starts to cast snare enchanter will get hit<br/>
&gt; and his pet will start to<br/>
&gt; attack.  By this time the ranger should have hit the<br/>
&gt; mob and taken agro from<br/>
&gt; the pet (The pet agro patch actually helped<br/>
&gt; enchanter pets a ton.  They<br/>
&gt; taunted like nobody&#39;s business and died fairly<br/>
&gt; quick).  Enchanter fears and<br/>
&gt; uses his mana wisely nuking when it wont hurt down<br/>
&gt; time more than help by  a<br/>
&gt; faster kill.  Ranger shouldnt cast any spells but<br/>
&gt; snare and save the rest of<br/>
&gt; his mana for heals depending on what you are<br/>
&gt; fighting a few seconds of non<br/>
&gt; feared mob might take a bub or two.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Using this tactic an Enchanter Ranger combo can make<br/>
&gt; a great team for<br/>
&gt; outdoor mobs.  Yes, you can substitue the ranger<br/>
&gt; class for any class that<br/>
&gt; can snare but there are a few reasons, in my<br/>
&gt; opinion, why rangers make the<br/>
&gt; best choice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Necro, he doesnt need an enchanter, he will get<br/>
&gt; faster exp solo, and the<br/>
&gt; only thing the enchanter will bring to the group is<br/>
&gt; haste (necro has this<br/>
&gt; for thier pet, enchanters haste is better at some<br/>
&gt; lvl&#39;s but really not a<br/>
&gt; good enough reason to group with you).  Clarity? <br/>
&gt; Necro lich type spells are<br/>
&gt; better at every lvl.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shadow Knight, his darkness spell doesnt seem to<br/>
&gt; last very long and unless<br/>
&gt; he has some really good weapons isnt going to do as<br/>
&gt; much dmg as a ranger.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Druid, too mana dependant over a period of time the<br/>
&gt; ranger will be able to<br/>
&gt; do better for you as the druid will start to go oom<br/>
&gt; with constant fighting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bard, maybe a nice second choice never duo&#39;d with<br/>
&gt; one much.  Maybe first,<br/>
&gt; never tried it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have also done this with a warrior that has a<br/>
&gt; snare whip but can make for<br/>
&gt; a nasty fight while waiting on whip to proc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just me rambling at work.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] Subject: Best soloing class<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am just wondering your thoughts on which class<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes for the best soloing.. all the way from<br/>
&gt; 1-60..<br/>
&gt; &gt; -emily<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This question comes up way way too often, i&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; argued about 20 seperate times on message boards,<br/>
&gt; here&#39;s how it usually plays out. The Necros and<br/>
&gt; Druids<br/>
&gt; immediately leap up and shout &quot;We&#39;re best!&quot; and<br/>
&gt; frankly, they are. Necros and Druids solo better<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; any other class in EQ. Which is better? It&#39;s largely<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; matter of personal preferance and where you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; soloing. Then everyone else crowds in on the thread<br/>
&gt; arguing the merits of their pet class. (as in<br/>
&gt; &quot;favorite class&quot;, not Mages ;) Technically really<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt; class can solo, it just involves unmanagable amounts<br/>
&gt; of downtime, picking less than profitable mobs, and<br/>
&gt; unacceptable amounts of risk... unless you&#39;re a<br/>
&gt; Druid<br/>
&gt; or Necro. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just an afterthought, had to reply to the post<br/>
&gt; questioning Mage&#39;s dominance as &quot;the pet class&quot;,<br/>
&gt; take<br/>
&gt; a look at the message boards on eqvault.ign.com<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a large thread comparing the Mage Epic pet<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; the highest level Beastlord pet.<br/>
