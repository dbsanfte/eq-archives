<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230000149">If people really need their fix, you can always log on to the Test Server. I<br/>
was in chat last night while my server was down and Easter the Tester was<br/>
making broadcast messages asking people to come play on his server. Then the<br/>
Test Server would announce when servers were back up so you could get back<br/>
on. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I recommend if you play on Test and on regular servers, is to have<br/>
2 separate EQ files on your computer, one for test and the other for regular<br/>
server. If you do this, you won&#39;t have to spend the time patching for both. <br/>
<br/>
I know I have been very unhappy with all the link dead and lag the past 2<br/>
days. I just can&#39;t waste the time to start anything in those situations.<br/>
Instead, I just sat GFay and listened to auctions and try to unload some<br/>
stuff taking up room in my banks.  <br/>

	Maybe they&#39;re going thru a growth spurt.  Having too many people<br/>
logging in<br/>
	and whatnot.  I also noticed last night that when a server goes<br/>
down, the<br/>
	newbie count goes WAY up as people switch over to another server for<br/>
a bit<br/>
	just so they can keep playing.  On PVP, that means a LOT of<br/>
resources taken<br/>
	up for the corpse count at the newbie entrance.  At least outside of<br/>
Qeynos<br/>
	it was that way, must&#39;ve been over 30 bodies laying on the ground<br/>
outside<br/>
	of the entrance to Qeynos.<br/>

	My husband and I kept going LD last night and that&#39;s what it was<br/>
doing when<br/>
	we tried to sign back on.  Computer #1 is P2-350 256 meg ram,<br/>
Windows ME,<br/>
	40<br/>
	gig HD, 8x burner.  Computer #2 is Celeron 533, 192 meg ram, 10 gig<br/>
HD,<br/>
	Windows ME.  Both are on cable modem using ICS.  We finally gave up<br/>
because<br/>
	of the lag and linkdead problems and then trying to get signed back<br/>
into<br/>
	game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	Is it just me, or is it taking longer and longer to connect?  I<br/>
couldn&#39;t<br/>
	even get past the login screen for 5 or 10 minutes.  Kept saying<br/>
that it<br/>
	couldn&#39;t connect to login server.  Never had that happen unless it<br/>
was down<br/>
	for a patch (which it wasn&#39;t).  Also noticed that the times when I<br/>
choose<br/>
	my server, and going to the character screen, and the time from the<br/>
	character screen to the game are much longer.<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;m running a Celeron 533 w/ 185 MB ram, windows ME a cable modem,<br/>
and<br/>
	about 2GB of drive space for windows to write to.  Any suggestions?<br/>
