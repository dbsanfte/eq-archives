<b>Subject:</b> Well some thoughts... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-740291609">I am a level 41 Ranger.  I have played many other classes, some over 20, but not<br/>
many.  The paladin and ranger classes cannot be compared unless our spells are<br/>
left out.  When dueling, paladins have a small advantage.  When melee&#39;ing<br/>
creatures, Rangers can come into the lead, dmg-wise.  I believe that Rangers<br/>
cannot truly see how powerful they will be until level 30, when a glimpse can be<br/>
caught, then at 39 when we get our true spells that we needed at level 30.  I<br/>
think that from level 20 to 30 is when most people will quit EQ or their<br/>
character because they think another class is more attractive, and it may be..<br/>
it depends upon the person to truly master the character.  I can kill a level 50<br/>
Wizard in a duel.  If he got one Ice Comet off and a couple hits with his stick,<br/>
I would be in the most trouble.  We cannot be compared.  All classes must work<br/>
together for a greater good.  I don&#39;t want to compare my 41 Ranger to a 41<br/>
Paladin.  I have great fun fighting with friends and helping them out with<br/>
things.  Don&#39;t complain about armor, weapons, spells, etc, because we are not<br/>
supposed to be gods at level 20, or 25, or 30, and we aren&#39;t supposed to be gods<br/>
at 50, or 75.  In a group, anything can be done.  No class can stand by itself.<br/>
It has been tried, and everyone who has tried failed, unless in some occasion<br/>
where 25 lvl 50 wizards got off ice comet at the same time at Vox or some other<br/>
beast.<br/>
<br/>
Rock on with a character if you like that character, and dont ever delete your<br/>
character if you want to start a new one, because you will regret it.<br/>
<br/>
If you play on the Bertoxxulous server, you may know me and the Guardians of<br/>
Tunare, and if you want to see the power that a ranger or any other class for<br/>
that matter has, give me a tell.  I have friends, and we will gladly help you<br/>
see why you must stick with your character to the end, whenever that may be,<br/>
after 500+ hours of playtime.<br/>

&gt; I enjoy my Ranger character.. I just get tired of people complaining about<br/>
&gt; what their class doesn&#39;t have.  I only posted that to say hey don&#39;t single<br/>
&gt; out classes that have perceived problems compared to others.. Rangers to<br/>
&gt; Palaies in particular.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hehe, I remember when wizards were complaining that Ice Comet is just not<br/>
&gt; powerful enough.  They claimed that without a more powerful spell, how could<br/>
&gt; they really be the masters of DD. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And as for your fun comment.. &quot;Getting to 50 without having fun is plain<br/>
&gt; stupid.&quot; Teamwork and using the class specific skills would add to the fun,<br/>
&gt; posting everything on the internet is what sucks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was anyone online during the DE war last night.. What did you think of it<br/>
&gt; all?<br/>

&gt; Oh, come on, stop moaning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * Its weird that Rangers are better than Paladins in combats dont you think?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * Bards get Track at lvl35.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * The quest for SSoM is very simple to complete for the Ranger.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have some of Ranger friends and they are doing great. I also have some<br/>
&gt; Pally friends and they are also doing great. Why does everybody want to be<br/>
&gt; the mightiest person in Norrath? I certainly do not. And wow people are<br/>
&gt; posting spawns points on the Internet, thats just not good for the game.<br/>
&gt; Getting to 50 without having fun is plain stupid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ENJOY THE RIDE.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My question is... When have the Rangers truly ever been upgrade?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     1.  Given &quot;Dances with Fire Flies spell&quot;  -  wow that&#39;s a winner<br/>
&gt; &gt;     2.  Given Critical Hits with bows  -  that&#39;s a no brainer - even<br/>
&gt; &gt; though warriors cover all weapons<br/>
&gt; &gt;     3.  Given Slightly Higher Caps on certain combat skills - making them<br/>
&gt; &gt; at least similar, but lower, to the other combat classes<br/>
&gt; &gt;     4.  Given +4 SV against fire and cold - does this really matter,<br/>
&gt; &gt; seriously =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s it..<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Sure I have track, but so do druids and bards.  Problem is, when all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the quests and locations for MOBs are published on the internet, who needs<br/>
&gt; &gt; that skill anymore.  I remember Brad saying that he wanted to make Rangers<br/>
&gt; &gt; the masters of duel wield... well how bout increasing our percentages for<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh well...   =) Lance<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;       After the recent upgrade to the Ranger, Paladins were certain that<br/>
&gt; &gt; they were<br/>
&gt; &gt;       next for enhancement. We waited patiently for the patch that was<br/>
&gt; &gt; supposed to<br/>
&gt; &gt;       be our salvation. Instead, what we received was armor quests that<br/>
&gt; &gt; were 10<br/>
&gt; &gt;       times the length and 5 times more costly than any of the quest of<br/>
&gt; &gt; any other<br/>
&gt; &gt;       class. And for all of that the armor stinks. Class specific plate<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor for<br/>
&gt; &gt;       the Paladin has less AC than that of the chain worn by the ranger.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Paladins<br/>
&gt; &gt;       are the &quot;Holy Knight&quot; counterpart to the ranger. Yet, with the last<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3<br/>
&gt; &gt;       patches, the Ranger has been augmented so that he has more AC even<br/>
&gt; &gt; though he<br/>
&gt; &gt;       can wear no platemail. He also has higher skill caps, does nearly<br/>
&gt; &gt; twice the<br/>
&gt; &gt;       damage in battle, has spell equivalents to most of the Paladins<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells yet<br/>
&gt; &gt;       not confined to undead. Ensnare is far more effective that root.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Several<br/>
&gt; &gt;       other spells and buffs of the druid class aren&#39;t nerfed , level<br/>
&gt; &gt; wise, as with<br/>
&gt; &gt;       the paladin. The ranger can track. Whereas the paladin can point<br/>
&gt; &gt; himself in<br/>
&gt; &gt;       the direction of the nearest undead, unless of course if there is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; pet in<br/>
&gt; &gt;       the area. Now to the arguements.<br/>
