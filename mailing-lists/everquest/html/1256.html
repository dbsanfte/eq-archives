<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994182954">&quot;We allow people to trade up, when better items drop.&quot;  How does this work?<br/>
We do the same thing on my server with what you call &quot;king&quot; looter, but we<br/>
call it Commie (common) loot.  But how would you do the trade up?  We hold<br/>
all items until the end (except those that are Obvious equipment upgrades<br/>
for someone then we roll right then) and lets say 5 good items dropped<br/>
everyone would roll one time 100 to 1000 or 1 to 100 whatever different<br/>
every time and everyone picks in that order.  The bulk of the good gems and<br/>
PP would go to the cleric for symbols and maybe some to the enchanter if<br/>
he/she was using Rune a lot.  How does the trade up work?<br/>

In most groups that I hunt with now, we use the king looter system, where<br/>
one<br/>
person loots everything and then it is divided out when someone leaves the<br/>
group.  If a major item drops, we normally have it go to whomever will use<br/>
it<br/>
first.  If no one will use it as a primary item, then it is rolled on by the<br/>
group.  We allow people to trade up, when better items drop.  Some days we<br/>
might<br/>
only see one or two major items drop.  Then other days, we have seen<br/>
multiples<br/>
of items drop and everyone in the party get something good.  It is always<br/>
that<br/>
luck element that decides the quality and quantity.  Nowadays, I am more<br/>
experienced oriented and fun oriented than loot oriented.  Most of the<br/>
places I<br/>
camp do not drop items that are useable by my class or drop items that are<br/>
better than the items I might already have.  I do not like loot hogs or<br/>
ninja<br/>
looters, but I am not really concern about loot as long as the system is<br/>
fair<br/>
and everyone understands and agrees to it ahead of the time.  :)<br/>
<br/>
It has been ages since I been in a group that use alpha loot or loot to X<br/>
plat<br/>
or whatever.  Normally, I really like the king looter system, since it<br/>
allows me<br/>
to concentrate on supporting the party and getting mana back up.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
On a side bar, what does FFA stand for.  I know I should know it, but I am<br/>
not<br/>
very good with abbreviations.<br/>

&gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
&gt; Just wondering.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>
&gt; people cooperate.<br/>
