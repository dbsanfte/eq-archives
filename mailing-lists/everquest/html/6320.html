<div id="ygrps-yiv-475123889">Ok, I was wrong, it&#39;s not a hub it&#39;s a switch. Netgear Ethernet Switch FS608 v2.<br/>
The modem itself hooks to 2 coaxial cables that attack to the satellite. The only output for the modem is to an ethernet port. My computers only have one ethernet card with one socket so if I hook only one computer directly to the modem the others cannot be connected.<br/>
The setup was working fine for quite awhile but then I started having problems with the modem&#39;s software. The TCP and web acceleration software kept not working. Right now it&#39;s telling me that TCP acceleration is &quot;Impaired&quot;. According to the techs (who happen to be in New Dehli), my internet should only go out during very severe weather conditions, but I randomly lose signal for no apparent reason on a frequent basis. Everytime I call my ISP they say the same things over and over. I even had to adjust my signal frequency. It got so bad at one point in June, they agreed to send someone out here to look at the satelite &quot;no later than July 4th&quot;. When I contacted the contractors about when they were coming out they said July 11th. Then when the guy didn&#39;t show up I called and they said he couldn&#39;t come til the next day. He didn&#39;t arrive until 8pm and it was too dark for him to see the satellite. He looked at it with a flashlight, said he couldn&#39;t see anything wrong with it and then left.<br/>
It&#39;s been so frustrating.     *sigh*<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are you absolutely sure it&#39;s not a router then??   A hub is a simple pass through device.  It doesn&#39;t define IP addresses or anything like that.  A router, on the other hand, is more complex and has an internal software that controls the traffic that comes through it.  If your modem is hooked through the hub, perhaps you&#39;d have better luck  disconnecting the modem from the hub and plugging it directly into the wall outlet and dialing in that way.  Then just let the hub do what the hub do and see if the computers connect as they should.  I don&#39;t know if I can illustrate tis properly.<br/>

&gt;You are using:       phone jack &gt;  modem  &gt;  hub  &gt;   PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Instead try:      phone jack  &gt;  modem  &gt; PC1  &gt; hub &gt; PC2, PC3, PC4<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It would really help me if I knew the model # of the modem and hub that you have so I know what we&#39;re dealign with.<br/>
