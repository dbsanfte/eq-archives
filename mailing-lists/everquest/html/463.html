<b>Subject:</b> Re: Bronze Armor, a little explanation please? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284201490">Hey,<br/>
<br/>
I have heard about absorbtion of armor, but do not understnad the<br/>
mechanics/formula/general idea behind it. My deep armor knowledge is<br/>
confined to games as primal as UO =) Sooo, if you can do a little<br/>
explanation of the general differences between AC and Absorbtion, I would be<br/>
most gracious. And also, will I notice a big difference between no armor and<br/>
my new Bronze (let&#39;s assume it&#39;s a full suit)? I know it should be an<br/>
obvious yes, but I have been less than enthralled with armor effects in the<br/>
game so far, and am wondering if I&#39;m going to noticed monsters about my<br/>
level that did 20 or so damage suddenly start doing 4 or 5.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch again,<br/>

(Just to cover my prospective flame bases, nothin against UO. IT is just my<br/>
personal opinion that EQ is faaaaaar better. =)<br/>

&gt;Bronze plate, in addition to being extremely heavy, does not<br/>
&gt;absorb damage as well as normal plate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the heaviness side - 86lb may not seem like much, until<br/>
&gt;you factor in that you will be carrying at least 10LB of weapons,<br/>
&gt;4LB of backpacks, several LB of food and drink, every 40 coins<br/>
&gt;weighs 1B. A full suit really isn&#39;t feasible for anything weaker than<br/>
&gt;a troll or ogre. </span></blockquote></div>
