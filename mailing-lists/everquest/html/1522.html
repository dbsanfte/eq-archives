<b>Subject:</b> Computer choice... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-251316539">I am running on an Emachine. Choose it because it was effectively <br/>
free, after rebates. My wife likes AOL, and the Compuserve deal was <br/>
good for us. Compuserve IS AOL, in every practical way. <br/>
<br/>
Added memory and a NVidia card with 32 meg. EQ runs alright. Now that <br/>
I am learning more about game machines, I am planning on an Alien for <br/>
my next computer. However, I think that this one will work well <br/>
enough for a year or two. I am sure I will know just when the change <br/>
over must take place. Somewhere where frustration vs available money <br/>
cross each other on the performance chart.<br/>
<br/>
The Emachine needs to be rebooted whenever the game has been played, <br/>
but while in the game I have no performance problems that seem <br/>
excessive or unreasonable for a mid-level system. Compuserve is not <br/>
great, but adequate. I would love DSL, but it is still $50 a month in <br/>
my location.<br/>
