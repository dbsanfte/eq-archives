<div id="ygrps-yiv-847277599">Ah. That&#39;s why you make friends. Group with some people. Make sure to play<br/>
nice. Ask others for advice. Find some people you really like hanging with<br/>
and put them on friends list. Then if you see them on contact them. Find out<br/>
if you can hang out with people who seem to get along with you really well.<br/>
No stalking though. :-)<br/>
I have friends that I met in the game who like to group with me or help me<br/>
out. I help them out. A guild is a wonderful thing as well. My guildies and<br/>
I like to get together and hang out. It&#39;s fun. :-)<br/>
luv,<br/>

I don&#39;t know it is hard to say. I am just not very good at most of the<br/>
aspects of EQ like camping items and meeting people to play with. I tend to<br/>
just go where everyone else my level is and join pickup groups. I hate<br/>
playing alone. It just seems like the game would be ten times better if you<br/>
had a group of friends to play with.<br/>

  Welcome back to EQ!<br/>
  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since September of 2000 or so. I obviously enjoy<br/>
  playing. :-) I&#39;m not sure exactly what kind of advice you&#39;re asking for<br/>
  here. Anything specific you need to know about?<br/>
  luv,<br/>

  Hi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. I am not a very good EQ<br/>
  player. I would consider myself ultra competent in group battles, but in<br/>
  other aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I have never gotten a<br/>
  character past level 40. My first character was an Erudite Enchanter by<br/>
the<br/>
  name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to level 40 after two years<br/>
or<br/>
  so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which was my friends character but<br/>
I<br/>
  own it. I just started playing again after giving up on the game and<br/>
playing<br/>
  DAOC. Eventually I gave up all MMORPGS deciding they were a waste of time.<br/>
  About a week ago, I decided to give EQ another chance and have decided<br/>
that<br/>
  it has improved a great deal. I am now playing a Human Ranger who is level<br/>
  30. I really like the character. His buffs and damage spells are great. I<br/>
  guess I could use some help on how to be a good EQ player. I have been<br/>
  playing for about two years and I feel like I know absolutely nothing<br/>
about<br/>
  the game. I have never belonged to a good guild or anything. I play on the<br/>
  Xegony server.<br/>
