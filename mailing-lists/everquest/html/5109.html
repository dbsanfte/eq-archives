<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383264992">All you need is a router and enough Ethernet cables to connect each computer<br/>
to the router, which in turn connects to your DSL modem. You can find a<br/>
four-port router from Linksys or D-Link in most shops that sell computer<br/>
hardware, and they&#39;re not too pricey. Configuration shouldn&#39;t be too<br/>
difficult, as a lot of consumer routers come with an installation CD that<br/>
will help users to configure their computers and the router to share an<br/>
Internet connection.<br/>

Hello everyone I have question for you guys.  Now before I start off I am<br/>
just starting to learn the hardware side of computers so bear with me lol,<br/>
now my question is what items would be needed in order to have 3 computers<br/>
share 1 DSL line?  When I get back I&#39;m gonna buy a laptop and have one of my<br/>
friends move in with me so we&#39;ll have 3 computers total on 1 DSL line thats<br/>
the reason why I ask this question.  Thanks for any help you guys can give<br/>
