<div>My husband plays a Shammy and he Grandmastered his alchemy recently by 
doing just the recipes for the Clarity X potions.&nbsp; He says&nbsp;you can get 
everything you need&nbsp;on potion merchants pretty cheap with the exception of 
nodding blue lilies which you can either buy in bazaar, forage on a character 
that has forage ability or go to Old Sebilis and kill the froggies for them, 
fairly good drop rate there and probably your best and cheapest bet for getting 
them.&nbsp; Hope that helps. :)</div>
