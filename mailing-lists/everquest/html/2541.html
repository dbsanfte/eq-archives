<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175930080">I need to find a better Melee weapon for my young, on<br/>
her own Druid, Amaiya (Ayonae Ro).  BF had suggested<br/>
asking around for a Fine Steel Scimitar but I have so<br/>
little money right now and the guy I talked to last<br/>
night wanted 10pp for the one he had...sheeeesh, I<br/>
don&#39;t even have 1pp yet...lol(but hey I am having<br/>
fun)..sow, no wait, that should be so, any suggestions<br/>
on a less expensive &quot;weapon&quot; and where i might find<br/>
it.  I tend to hang out close to the lifts so I can<br/>
run like hell if I have to so if there is somewhere<br/>
near there that would be helpful...<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you all safe travels..<br/>
<br/>
Amaiya, the Evercurious<br/>
 Druid, Ayonae Ro (aka as Naara)<br/>
