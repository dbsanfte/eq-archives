<div id="ygrps-yiv-521329094">I did something really stupid last night. I logged into Everquest and <br/>
opted to purchase LDoN online. One suggestion, DON&#39;T do it if you <br/>
have a 56K dial-up connection LOL. It started to download and said it <br/>
would take 22 hours and 26 minutes! I guess I will take my laptop to <br/>
work and download it on the T1 LOL. Sheesh!</div>
