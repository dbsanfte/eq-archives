<div id="ygrps-yiv-286280388">Sorry you didn&#39;t like it. Myself, I haven&#39;t<br/>
experienced any of the bugs most ppl have been<br/>
complaining about, so I guess I got lucky. The lag<br/>
gets to me sometimes, but that&#39;s because I got the<br/>
cheapest 64 meg card I could get away with, lol.<br/>
<br/>
For me, it&#39;s so nice to be able to do something other<br/>
than kill kill kill the same ole monsters over and<br/>
over again. Just my opinion, of course.<br/>

&gt; got to beta it, because I<br/>
&gt; would have sure been ticked off if I had paid all<br/>
&gt; that money for it! And I<br/>
&gt; waited for that game for years. What a<br/>
&gt; disappointment. When I went to get my<br/>
&gt; pre-order deposit back, the manager said that they<br/>
&gt; had been giving a<br/>
&gt; whooooole lot of deposits back...<br/>

&gt; Guess I&#39;ll just wait for EQII.  :-)<br/>
