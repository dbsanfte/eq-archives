<div id="ygrps-yiv-757776941">This is exactly what happened to me.  i had asked if<br/>
anyone could help a young druid stand a fighting<br/>
chance on her own...i was meaning just buffs...along<br/>
came this WONDERFUL person who suited me with some<br/>
basic leather armor and gave me 50pp to boot to help<br/>
buy my spells...i was amazed!!!  He said he was<br/>
fulfilling a promise...i will be glad to one day have<br/>
the opportunity to give back to another who is just<br/>
starting out...What is it they say...&quot;Pay It<br/>
Forward&quot;??<br/>
<br/>
