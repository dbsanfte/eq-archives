<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171918757">The perennial problem. I think on the whole I take the opposite view.<br/>
Whacking a spell caster quicker than he can fry you is well worthwhile.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Wizard Poll: Piercing or Blunt, which is better for 1-10lvl wizard to<br/>
<br/>
utilize?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sort of ties into the old argument about whether its better to be<br/>
able <br/>
to hit MORE often for lesser amounts of damage or hit LESS often for<br/>
higher <br/>
amounts of damage.  Personally, Im into instant gratification and MUCH<br/>
prefer <br/>
blunt.  I wouldnt use anything other than 2HB.  I think this is a<br/>
personal <br/>
preference.<br/>
