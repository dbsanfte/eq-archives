<div id="ygrps-yiv-823408722">Mmm... it&#39;s true that the peopel who are getting PLed are not doing <br/>
much work.  They level faster than people who actually level <br/>
themselves.  I understand how you would think this is not really fair <br/>
but sometimes people like to help others.  When I help people, I PL <br/>
them.  I won&#39;t help them get equipment because that&#39;s what you need <br/>
to do for yourself since it generally makes you more powerful <br/>
especially magical items.  AND when I PL them, I don&#39;t take over <br/>
camps to help them level.  I just look around for roaming mobs that <br/>
are not a RARE of course and let them kill it.  Heal them when <br/>
necessary.  The usual method.  I don&#39;t steal camps from people or <br/>
camp things when tyring to PL &#39;em.  I know that&#39;s wrong cuz if I did <br/>
that I would feel like I&#39;m hogging the camp since I wouldn&#39;t get xp <br/>
in the first place and it&#39;s a camp that everyone wants to have.  For <br/>
example, PLing in cb.  I just look for any orcs i see and let them <br/>
kill it.  There are hardly any camps in there.  The only camps there <br/>
are in cb are in the castle itself and near the tents.  Anyway, my <br/>
point is, is that I find it wrong when people take over camps to PL <br/>
but I find it ok when people just kill roaming mobs to PL.  AND yeah, <br/>
I don&#39;t like when peopel twink.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t give peopel <br/>
equipment or money.  Maybe leather armor but that&#39;s about it.<br/>

&gt; Opinions vary. I personally find the whole power leveling idea to <br/>
be most<br/>
&gt; dishonorable. To see an orc camp taken over by a 50+ druid and a lv <br/>
6 ogre<br/>
&gt; warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer reminds me how people are <br/>
have no<br/>
&gt; willingness to work for things (the whole cheat code thing). But <br/>
many people<br/>
&gt; find it ok to twink/power level and, well, so be it. I can see it, <br/>
shiver,<br/>
&gt; and keep moving. Live and let live. I am fortunate that at lv 43 I <br/>
can solo<br/>
&gt; and this is only an inconvience at worse to me instead of a real <br/>
issue. But<br/>
&gt; up until lv 35 I was still having camps stolen from me by uber <br/>
twinks and<br/>
&gt; anon druids.<br/>
