Thanks very much for that. In fact I was just about to ask the <br/>
question of 64MB v 128Mb cards.  I have been shopping around and can <br/>
get a 128Mb ATI Radeon based card or a 64MB nVidia GEForce.<br/>
<br/>
Is there any difference with EQ between ATI and nVidia graphics?<br/>
<br/>
What sort of loading and zoning times should I ideally see?<br/>
<br/>
I am still trying to understand why the graphic controller should <br/>
slow down loading and zoning - I can see why it would affect game <br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
Regards.</div>
