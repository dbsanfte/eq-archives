<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263728053">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the group.  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since the beginning of <br/>
the year so I&#39;d be a &quot;newbie&quot;.  I have 2 characters that I play... a <br/>
Level 12 Druid named Kanalyn and a Level 9 Beastlord named Analyn.  I <br/>
play on Tarew Marr and would love to make some new friends.  I&#39;m also <br/>
interested in joining a Guild but have no idea how to go about it or <br/>
which ones are available.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I look forward to meeting everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
