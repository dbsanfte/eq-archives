<div id="ygrps-yiv-420786766">My point exactally..� whats the point of playing the game with what you have<br/>
muled over from another character.. hehe Does it make the game progress any<br/>
faster.. NO.�Just play the game as its meant, if you do it any other<br/>
way...why its just a glorified irc chat room.� You still cant fight anything<br/>
beyond your level, you just stand out someone whos trying to bypass the<br/>
system, and most people will look down on you as someone who cant handle the<br/>
game.� Nothing personal i just put all twinkies in the same catogery.� The<br/>
game is just not that hard, but as in real life everyone is looking for a<br/>
handout.� Later... Smile... :)<br/>

In my experience on The Rathe, the only level 2 players you will see in full<br/>
bronze got that full bronze from one of their older siblings, who DID it the<br/>
hard way to begin with...worked their way up the ladder until they were high<br/>
enough to acquire such good items.� I currently have only one persona in<br/>
EQ...a cleric who is almost level 40 now.� She acquired her exp and items<br/>
the hard way...fighting and dying for them, saving enough plat to buy them,<br/>
camping for hours and days on end for them, and trading some of them for<br/>
others.� I have all my banded from my early days and some other nice things<br/>
vaulted...I did not sell them.� Why? Because when my current persona DOES<br/>
get a sibling, you can bet that is whom they are going to go to. A Twinkie?<br/>
Yah, you betcha.� But don&#39;t forget....they were originally gotten the long,<br/>
hard way.� <br/>
�<br/>
Been there...done that....not gonna do it again.<br/>

Sometimes I ponder this.� Why to people just give things away to people. Let<br/>
them work for it, or at least pay for it.� Especially when the person<br/>
receiving it has no idea where it came from.� Its funny and sad really, when<br/>
your in the newbie yard and you see a level 2 player chasing a snake around<br/>
in full bronze armor.� The Crude Stein is no big deal, but if someone wants<br/>
to give you something that is significant don&#39;t accept it.� Add a little<br/>
character to your character, so to speak. Get down in the trenches with the<br/>
rest of us, in the long run it will make you a better player.� Some call it<br/>
twinking, I call them Twinkies..� looks good yet not much substance. :) hehe<br/>
<br/>
Anyways...�� have fun... hehe <br/>
