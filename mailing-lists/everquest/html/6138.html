<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340604412">From previous experience, yes, the guild tool IS that badly hosed. Our lvl<br/>
70 guild leader&#39;s cleric commonly shows up anywhere from 22 to 53, our necro<br/>
is known to show as low as 3 thanks to his new ranger, and mine are all over<br/>
the board on all 3 accounts. Always worth a laugh when someone who doesn&#39;t<br/>
know my alts well wonders why I haven&#39;t bothered to level my enc since she&#39;s<br/>
&quot;so close to KEI&quot;.  She&#39;s actually 38 now, and was about 22 at the time, but<br/>
gets this every level or so. My sneaky 57 gnome wiz, always making trouble,<br/>
he is....<br/>
<br/>
The bad side is, 4 levels in a week on my mage and everyone thinks THAT&#39;S<br/>
bugged, not legit :-)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m glad you brought that up Su, I&#39;m worried that your account was<br/>
&gt; hacked or something because your cleric is showing up as level 34 ( I<br/>
&gt; think ) and your brothers SK is showing up as level 19 ( I think ) and<br/>
&gt; that really freaked me out.  I understand that the guild aplet can<br/>
&gt; sometimes be hosed, but that&#39;s never happened to me before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please consider working it out with SOE, the rewards they are offering<br/>
&gt; long timers like us for renewing for another year at $99 is actually<br/>
&gt; really attractive and I bet you are 6 year vet too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me know if there is ANYTHING I can do to help you.<br/>

&gt; I may be through with EQ now. I went to login to check my email and<br/>
&gt; apparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea why.<br/>
&gt; Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with my<br/>
&gt; brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not I want<br/>
&gt; to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a higher price.<br/>
&gt; I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me off that they<br/>
&gt; pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an angry letter of<br/>
&gt; complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>
&gt; ARG. Just ARG!!!<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
