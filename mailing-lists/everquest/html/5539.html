 </span></blockquote>Whatever you do I seriously wouldn&#39;t suggest letting a friend use <br/>
your<br/>
account. While I was on westpac for 9 months I let my friend (who<br/>
introduced me into EQ) use my account since I wouldn&#39;t be able to <br/>
play while<br/>
I was overseas in the gulf. Well when I came back all my characters <br/>
were<br/>
naked and all they had in their inventorys were trader&#39;s sacks. Of <br/>
course<br/>
they were in the bazaar. All my gear on all my characters had been <br/>
sold in<br/>
the bazaar and I had some really expensive stuff like a couple 30k <br/>
horses.<br/>
Of course it was my fault giving him my account to use in the first <br/>
place.<br/>
If you are worried about loosing all your gear then take my advice - <br/>
never<br/>
give your account to your friends.<br/>

come out as gold yet some will be revealed as only coals..<br/>
<br/>
My own experience on EQ, lost manastone and some superb dragon <br/>
armors from my cleric, oh well.. lucky I still have my jboots hehe <br/>
love them!<br/>
<br/>
On other games, I have lost my heart along with my faith in them. <br/>
Some of those friends.. were decades long acquantainces, grown up <br/>
together, work together, heck even know their family personally..<br/>
<br/>
..but when these types of things happens, mostly it was the greed of <br/>
moolah, the ebay and paypal thing, the simplistic easy of it to <br/>
barter electronics data into cold hard cash in hmm minutes nowadays?<br/>
<br/>
Lost my UO trammel Large Tower along with all the rares in it and <br/>
the bank, sigh.. some friends even bragged or was forced to reveal <br/>
how much they DID gained by selling those off in free market..<br/>
<br/>
I must have lost over 20k on ebay/paypal sales that I had refused to <br/>
even let myself be tempted.. (beware, its like a tv shows, those <br/>
folks that WANT ur thing, WILL get to u by getting close to ur <br/>
friends! Every people has their price, sooner or later..<br/>
<br/>
You might think it wont hurt u so much, since its nothing, since <br/>
they r ur friends, since life goes on, since its all about fun.. <br/>
trust me, it cut deep and the scars will still hurts.. it will never <br/>
be the same again..<br/>
<br/>
Mostly it happens in.. guilds. Sigh..<br/>
<br/>
(haha, and all this lecture, I myself am still so gullible, let a <br/>
female guildmate ask me for favours and I will be the 1st to jump to <br/>
aid =)</div>
