<b>Subject:</b> Fed up with EQ - any ideas?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-738853210">I&#39;m rather fed up with Verant! They&#39;re constantly nerfing everything ingame <br/>
that&#39;s worth while, or ignoring classes that need to be balanced or <br/>
upgraded! So in retrospect, I&#39;m looking to find greener pastures elsewhere. <br/>
Perhaps someone out there knows of another game (other than AC and UO) or <br/>
perhaps a group who&#39;s programming their own game similar to EQ? If so, <br/>
please don&#39;t hesistate to drop me a line or two via email. Tks in advance!</div>
