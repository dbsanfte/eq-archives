<b>Subject:</b> Re: zoning observations and stats <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-818628087">Here are my observations/stats on the zoning thread:<br/>
<br/>
2 computers:<br/>
  Pent II 300, 128 PC-100 Ram, Creative TNT 16M Vid card, cable modem<br/>
  approx 1gig of Free Space left on HD<br/>
  <br/>
  AMD K6-200, 128 RAM, Creative TNT 16M Vid card, cable modem<br/>
  Approx 1gig of Free Space left on HD<br/>
<br/>
~Main difference in H/W is processing power<br/>
<br/>
Ping stats:<br/>
  Ping to servers: &lt; 80<br/>
  No packetloss from either end.<br/>
  Packet Transfer rate from servers: &gt; 400<br/>
  (it&#39;s great living in San Diego =P )<br/>
<br/>
Testing:<br/>
  Zoning to different areas<br/>
  Zoning by death (same zone, reloading after dying)<br/>
  recorded # players from current zone and destination zone<br/>
  each test was with only 1 computer online at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Results:<br/>
 the AMD took about 45-60 secs to load zones, the Pent II took about<br/>
10-15 sec.   <br/>
<br/>
 I have found when zoning in large cities or dungeons I get longer <br/>
load times (by 3-5 sec)<br/>
<br/>
 The times did not seem to change much with the number of players in the<br/>
zone i&#39;m going TO. eg left zone of 45 players to zone with 75 players, and<br/>
vice versa.  On average it was about a 3 sec more load time.<br/>
<br/>
 The times also didn&#39;t change when zoning into an area with<br/>
a lot of merchants vs very few or none. But # of NPC (non merchants) can<br/>
be a factor too. <br/>
<br/>
 The HD&#39;s on both machines lit up for the same amount of time (2-3 sec)<br/>
between zoning. <br/>
<br/>
 Tests were done both in Day and Night EQ time. In case vid rendering <br/>
played any factors.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion:<br/>
  I did a few more series of experimenting, but it seems<br/>
to boil down to Processor speed; at least for me.  I&#39;ve read some posts<br/>
that are almost opposite of my findings, however, it wasn&#39;t mentioned<br/>
if it was the same zone or the player loads on that zone they were <br/>
comparing it to.  e.g. comparing zone times of someone going from<br/>
south Qeynos city to north gets a 10sec load, to someone in Freeport <br/>
going to east or west freeport getting 15 sec loads may not be a fair<br/>
comparison.  <br/>
  I also noticed that the Character will show up on the other side<br/>
of the zone (as observed by another player) but my screen still show<br/>
it still loading.  This seems to indicate that there is some procssing<br/>
still being done on the Client side even though the character has <br/>
already been loaded into the new zone.  This was also verified when<br/>
I died (in the same zone I respawn in), I respawned or rather my Screen<br/>
unfroze right before I got a death blow from some Orc that just happend<br/>
to be camping on my spawning point. =)  This tells me that my character<br/>
was active on the server, but my machine was still procssing info before<br/>
it could unfreeze my screen.   On my Pent II machine, my character <br/>
appearing and my screen unfreezing seem to lag by 2-3 seconds. <br/>
  I did play via 56k v90 modem on my Pent II a few times and noticed no<br/>
real difference on load times.  I did notice teleporting chars/mobs and<br/>
had higher ping and packetloss ( &gt;400 ping, 3-8% packetloss).<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: All this is just my quick experimentation to see if my<br/>
AMD was worth using to play EQ on (Just set it up a few days ago). There<br/>
may be other factors that can disprove all of this.  In anycase it was<br/>
my personal testing i thought i&#39;d share with the List.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just my few coppers...<br/>
