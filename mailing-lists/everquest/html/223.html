<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297224706">Hiya<br/>
  i have a amd 400mhz 64mb of ps100 ram   16mb video card-banshee<br/>
and an awesome creative 128bit sound card. however i have NEVER zoned in   <br/>
less than a minute, usually more, i know a lot of it is processor<br/>
i have hit zones withgroups and i am the last one to wake up so to speak<br/>
the others had p2 350mhz etc  i do have a 33.6 modem so i think it is<br/>
the modem connection that makes the biggest difference, i wish my work<br/>
computer had a cd rom drive installed, its just a p266 with 80mb but the<br/>
45kps T1 connection would surely be nice as opposed to my<br/>
3.5 to about 4.0kps i get with my 33.6 modem. does anyone out there<br/>
play on a recommended p200 or above system req and use a T1?<br/>
i wold love to know the zone times ya get:)<br/>
