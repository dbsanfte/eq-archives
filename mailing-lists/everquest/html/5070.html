<div id="ygrps-yiv-334959384">Are the new item augmentions kinda like the same thing with Diablo?  And<br/>
what are charms used for?  And with the armor dyes, can you preview the<br/>
armor your going to dye before you actually do it?  Yeah David the Froglocks<br/>
took over the Troll city of Grobb, but once I get back (48 days and a wake<br/>
up!) I will reclaim that city back for Dabashers (at least until the guards<br/>
respawn)  Happy Hunting people!<br/>

Welcome back David!<br/>
Legends of Ykesha comes with new zones, new items, new tradeskill recipes,<br/>
and more bank space! not only do you get double your bank space, but they<br/>
have now made it so you have 2 additional bank slots that are shared by all<br/>
of your characters. There is even a shared coin bank part. Ykesha also added<br/>
a new inventory slot for charms. All of the charms I have seen are no drop<br/>
and are either quested for or dropped from npcs in the Ykesha zones. Oh,<br/>
Ykesha also added a new playable race-- Frogloks. With a special dye only<br/>
from Ykesha you can dye your armor whatever color you want. The only bad<br/>
thing is that one of the evil races got kicked out of their home and now<br/>
share neriak with the darkelves.<br/>
Lost Dungeons of Norrath added new zones and instanced dungeons that only<br/>
you and your party can enter. No more fighting over spawns. You can choose<br/>
your adventure type and have a time limit for completion. Inside the<br/>
dungeons there are chests and barrels and such that can be unlocked and<br/>
opened or bashed into opening up. You need to be careful of these as they<br/>
are often trapped. Dungeons also added item augmentations. Via quests or<br/>
killing mobs you can get magical stones that when combined in a little pool<br/>
thingy on a pedastel (found in the Wayfarer&#39;s camps) you can augment an<br/>
item. The first one you get is the Adventurers stone, which increases the<br/>
enchantments the more you interact and advance in your status with the<br/>
wayfarers.<br/>
It&#39;s really quite neat. :-)<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
  I am back. I have been gone for awhile. But, for the ones that are new and<br/>
dont remember me. I am David, I am 29. I play EverQuest on a normal bases.<br/>
But, right now I havent been on for a while because I had to let my scribes<br/>
go for the time being. I am planning to get back soon. I want to get the two<br/>
newiest expanesion. Lancy of Ysheka, and the lost dangunes. Please forgive<br/>
me I am a bad speller. But I like to keep up with it. I have a question<br/>
where do you get EQ IM? And, does it cost anythign extra? Is there in thing<br/>
great about those expanses? I know I have alot of questions. But, I remember<br/>
that you guys are really helpful, and I am glad. I hope to make some friends<br/>
that like the samethings I do.<br/>
