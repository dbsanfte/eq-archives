<b>Subject:</b> Luclin madness (fix it dammit before coming up with new crap) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-125017317"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;For the record, does Luclin run slow for everyone?<br/>
&gt;The only time I ever go up there is to get spells for<br/>
&gt;my Druid because of the major lag I have had<br/>
&gt;there ever since it came out. It takes me twice as<br/>
&gt;long to zone there than it does anywhere else in the<br/>
&gt;game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It did last time I was there, rumor is they&#39;ve made<br/>
improvements, but I still have yet to find any reason<br/>
to bother. Nothing I really want from Luclin is that<br/>
difficult to buy in EC...<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the upcoming EQ expansion &quot;Planes of Power&quot;<br/>
comes with a 2ghz athlon and 500mb of RAM so that<br/>
everyone will have the &quot;power&quot; to actually run Luclin<br/>
smoothly... *snicker*<br/>
