<b>Subject:</b> Need non-kos mage for Chardok on Tribunal <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853632495">Ok I normally don&#39;t resort to begging, but I&#39;m desperate here.<br/>
I recently scheduled a raid for Chardok to kill Overking Bathezid for my<br/>
cleric epic.<br/>
I had druids, tanks, high lvl clerics, etc.. Unfortunately the mage that was<br/>
supposed to come was a no-show. So the raid had to be cancelled as we didn&#39;t<br/>
have enough people to fight their way in.<br/>
I then realized that I don&#39;t even know any high level mages who are not kos<br/>
in chardok (and who have the ability to summon people to them).<br/>
If you know anyone who has such a character or are such a person, please<br/>
please please let me know. I will give free rezzes with my click stick once<br/>
I get it.<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
luv,<br/>
