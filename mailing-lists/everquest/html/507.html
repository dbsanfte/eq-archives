<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522710571">If you head north where the river comes to the mountain, take a look thru<br/>
the ice and you will see the cave.  Sometimes you will see a goblin swimming<br/>
at the mouth of the cave.  The cave itself is inside the mountain, so as you<br/>
swim it will eventauly open up above the surface of the water.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the NPC Necro&#39;s con was aggressive and he was red at lvl 16.<br/>
Be careful when approaching him.  BTW there is very little light, and it is<br/>
a maze ( oh what fun... hehe)<br/>
<br/>
I never zoned so i dont believe its a new zone, just undiscovered..  the<br/>
cave itself is quite large (or it seemed that way) but was relativly empty.<br/>
This is what i saw:<br/>
<br/>
1.. House with 4 icebone skeletons<br/>
2.. Shrine ( zone point )structure protected by 2 icebones skeletons<br/>
3.. Human NPC Necromancer with pet  - red at lvl 16<br/>
4.. Possible Giant.. (type unknown) - I never saw one myself<br/>
<br/>
And, there could be more to the cave that went unexplored, because i had no<br/>
way of passing the Necro at the time. I was informed of the cave by a fellow<br/>
player.  She stated that she had seen a giant, but alass i have not.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck <br/>

Intresting...<br/>
<br/>
You mean under the ice, wheras you take the small hole in the ice then swim <br/>
for it? Which direction? I would like to go check that out sometime. Do you <br/>
think that the cave will become a new zone area, or just a cave under the <br/>
water? And the Necro you say you saw, was he an NPC PK or just a normal NPC?<br/>
<br/>
Did he scrowl at you?</div>
