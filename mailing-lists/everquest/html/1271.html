<b>Subject:</b> Druid flying solo, mostly. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239585106">I am developing a halfling druid for mostly solo play. I group once <br/>
in a while, but prefer to develop solo skills. I am a relatively new <br/>
player, so I am not sure just where I am going.<br/>
<br/>
My current goal is attaining level 14, to gain SOW and bind. I then <br/>
plan to begin traveling and picking up some of the little quests. <br/>
<br/>
I am drawn initially toward the Commons. Any suggestions as to what <br/>
interesting low-level solo quests might be in that area?<br/>
