you could try grouping in Rathe Mountains in a Hill Giant group.  Xp there<br/>
is good up till at least 51. At about I think say 48 or 49 you could<br/>
probably solo the HG pretty well.  My 53 Shammy was there not long ago and<br/>
the HG were more green than Light Blue by then but the Cash is great and you<br/>
can go to the inn and there is a short guy in the hut closest toward HG<br/>
valley who is on the left as you enter the hut that if you buy a stack of or<br/>
2 or three of amber  (cost about 42pp pr stack with a Charisma of 140) and<br/>
resell back to him will get rid of the smaller coins tremendously and yield<br/>
you a return of around 39 to 40pp per stack..  I&#39;ve done this many a time<br/>
when ever I needed to get cash up for my tradeskills supplies.<br/>

Well I&#39;ve been playing my rogue consistently now since last Thursday.  I&#39;ve<br/>
gone up 4 levels.  I&#39;m almost to level 37 now.  Still in Dawnshroud Peaks.<br/>
But I guess I&#39;m getting too impatient.  XP isn&#39;t coming nearly as fast as<br/>
I&#39;d like.  I can pretty much solo lightcrawlers and some shrooms now. The<br/>
tribals I can take if I have buffs, but that&#39;s about it.  I&#39;m getting really<br/>
tired of Dawnshroud.  Anybody have any suggestions on where I can go next<br/>
that the xp might come a little faster?  I was told Dreadlands, but I should<br/>
wait until I&#39;m about level 38.  A place with some nice plat would be good<br/>
too as I need to start upgrading my weapons and armor.  I need a better bow<br/>
and some + stamina gear.  Any suggestions on what gear I could get or where<br/>
I could hunt?<br/>
