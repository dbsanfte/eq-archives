<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay I have to step in 
here.&nbsp; first of all customer service has always sucked.&nbsp; I used to 
call before the stormhammer server went live using the 800 number and it was 
always busy.&nbsp; Occasionally i would get through but that was few and far 
between.&nbsp; Second of all those who play Stormhammer should get a little more 
support due to the fact the server cost about $40/month instead of the 
$12.95/month that you pay or I pay for that matter.&nbsp; Third have you tried 
using the live tech support on the web site itself es you may wait a while 
before someone comes on but when they do they take all the time you need to get 
your problem solved.&nbsp; Also if you read the note that was posted on the site 
you would have seen the reason they rasied the price of the game.&nbsp; finally 
I like the game and disagree that the game is going downhill, it is perfectly 
fine the way it is .&nbsp; I hate to say this if you don&#39;;t likeit so much than 
why play.</font></div></html></div>
