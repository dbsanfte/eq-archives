<div id="ygrps-yiv-352618116">Yeah. If you opt to get the download only version you might want to suck up<br/>
to a friend to burn copies of the files onto a CD and send to you.<br/>
I was shocked when I found a woman in the hardware store in this small town<br/>
who actually plays EQ.<br/>

Awhile back they had a patch where you could opt to download it in smaller<br/>
chunks as they became available...  all you had to do was click on yes.<br/>
This is exactly what they were tryign to avoid because the network traffic<br/>
ties up the bandwidth when people do this and nobody can connect.<br/>

T1 will still take a good chunk of time, but not an entire day.<br/>

  I did something really stupid last night. I logged into Everquest and<br/>
  opted to purchase LDoN online. One suggestion, DON&#39;T do it if you<br/>
  have a 56K dial-up connection LOL. It started to download and said it<br/>
  would take 22 hours and 26 minutes! I guess I will take my laptop to<br/>
  work and download it on the T1 LOL. Sheesh!<br/>
