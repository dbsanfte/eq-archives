<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130091214">I am a Level 4 Wood Elf Warrior and was wondeirng where would be a <br/>
good place to go hunting that would have a good profit and kills which won&#39;t <br/>
be too, too challenging. Also, my guild, The Keepers of the Eternal Elves are <br/>
going to be holding a tourney later on which I will have more info on at a <br/>
later date. But can someone please tell me a good place?<br/>
