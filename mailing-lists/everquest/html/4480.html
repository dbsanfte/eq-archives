<div id="ygrps-yiv-113939708">Hi all...<br/>
I am just wondering.... I am a Human Mage and I just recently <br/>
acquired the Robe of the Ishva. This item has no intelligence but it <br/>
does have +50 Mana. Can someone please tell me what is better for a <br/>
mage? I normally buy Intelligence items, but someone has told me that <br/>
direct Mana is better. Can I get your opinions please????<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
