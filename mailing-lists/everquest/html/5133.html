<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945447073">Well, from your name I would say you&#39;re a wood elf, female.  So <br/>
you&#39;re wandering around Kelethin, the city of great heights.  So be <br/>
careful!<br/>
<br/>
This place is a good start.  Some of the other favorites are <br/>
Castersrealm, Allakhazam&#39;s Magic Realm, Everlore and EQ Traders <br/>
Corner. <br/>
<br/>
Other important questions are what class are you, like Druid, Ranger <br/>
or Warrior.  We got plenty of them all!<br/>
