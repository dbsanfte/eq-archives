<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933560903">Yeah. Root is very good. It can save your life if you have to park a mob and<br/>
run to zone. It could mean one less mob hitting you from behind and such. Or<br/>
give you time to move away and gate.<br/>

Didn&#39;t bother with root?? I have a level 50 Ogre Shaman that STILL uses root<br/>
to this day. Get all your spells...you might be surprised how useful they<br/>
can be.<br/>

  I say go with the vah shir shaman &lt;grin&gt; I play one & it&#39;s awsome.  you<br/>
are not kos in many places plus,  the vah shir look cool =D  Shamans get<br/>
root at 14 and a couple others which I never bothered with as tthe mobs have<br/>
a chance to break the root with every hit with the other roots.<br/>

    the only problem I foresee with using a troll shaman is that wonderful<br/>
20% xp penalty.  you could go with a dark elf shadowknight (clinging<br/>
darkness at 15) and a barb or vah shir shaman, thereby not having to worry<br/>
about the xp penalty, and getting a snare type spell at 15.  you could also<br/>
use a druid for the healer type, and they get snare fairly early, (I&#39;m not a<br/>
big fan of druids, but if you like their play style, good on ya)  plus<br/>
heals, and regen.  a druid combo with a warrior, SK, or pally could be a<br/>
very easy leveling pair.   tis your choice on what to use as a duo, just be<br/>
aware that there are lots of problems with pet pathing in dungeons.<br/>

      Necros are pretty nice though. They got snare, mez, healing and damage<br/>
over time. Insane mana regen. A good pet. Summon corpse. I could summon my<br/>
corpses if they die, and then rez them to get the exp back.<br/>
<br/>
      I guess I&#39;m gonna go with the shaman though. Sounds like a Paladin<br/>
should be able to kill just about anything with 1375 extra hp and their mana<br/>
to life conversion spell and Regrowth and Torpor cast on them against a<br/>
slowed and dotted mob.<br/>
<br/>
      I&#39;ll use a Troll shaman too for the snare which would be really useful<br/>
in a dungeon.<br/>

          I have two computers and two accounts and I want to play two<br/>
characters to at least level 50. I want to be able to go into dungeons for<br/>
experience instead of outdoor kiting. One of the characters I would like to<br/>
be is a paladin. I have been playing a paladin/magician duo and it seems<br/>
really good for dungeon play. I have been looking at necromancers, shaman<br/>
and druids as well. They all seem to have their strengths and weaknesses.<br/>
Paladin/Shaman duo seems really good, as the Shaman would be like a third<br/>
tank. The others would go down fast when swarmed.<br/>
