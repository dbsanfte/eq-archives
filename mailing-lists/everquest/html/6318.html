<div><font size="2">With a hub or switch (as opposed to a router) you&#39;d neet some 
sort of software router (program) to connect the modem to a PC via 
one&nbsp;ethernet card and then that PC to the hub with another and have the net 
connection be shared. Otherwise it&#39;ll only share files. Been there, done that, 
satisfied Sygate user for about 5 years now. </font></div>

<div><font size="2">Mine&#39;s basically identical to what Wulfric is telling you to 
switch to.... modem-pc-switch-all other machines...with a software router and 
firewall running on the machine that&#39;s directly connected to the 
modem.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Originally I was using the first pc&#39;s dialup modem in 
otherwise the exact same setup, and once I got DSL I slapped a second NIC in and 
nothing really changed much once the basic connection details were set 
up...Sygate didn&#39;t need to be reconfigured. To this day I can switch bt DSL and 
dialup just by changing what&#39;s plugged in and forcing it to dial, if I need to 
use the dialup for some reason (DSL dying on a CR for example, or a social event 
I couldn&#39;t miss during the time while the replacement modem was being 
shipped)</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">If you choose Sygate, be aware that it says it has a preset 
config for EQ, but you shouldn&#39;t need this. Mine&#39;s ran happily for years with 
nothing configured except hosting UT games. EQ sorted itself out flawlessly on 
the first try. All you *might* need to configure would be hosting other 
games&nbsp; and they usually provide detailed directions either in the manual or 
on their webpage.</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Are you absolutely sure it&#39;s not a router 
  then??&nbsp;&nbsp; A hub is a simple pass through device.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t 
  define IP addresses or anything like that.&nbsp; A router, on the other hand, 
  is more complex and has an internal software that controls the traffic that 
  comes through it.&nbsp; If your modem is hooked through the hub, perhaps you&#39;d 
  have better luck&nbsp; disconnecting the modem from the hub and plugging it 
  directly into the wall outlet and dialing in that way.&nbsp; Then just let the 
  hub do what the hub do and see if the computers connect as they should.&nbsp; 
  I don&#39;t know if I can illustrate tis properly.</font></div>
