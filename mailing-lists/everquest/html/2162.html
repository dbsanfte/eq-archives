<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-718527997">Thanks for the info. I will run by Highpass and purchase a bit of ore <br/>
to try out. See just how hard hunting my own will be. I might be wise <br/>
to postpone the visit to Kunark for a few more levels, from what I <br/>
have read here. I am sure I can find something useful to do for a few <br/>
levels. Any suggestions for possible good zones in Kunark to work <br/>
through those levels? Might be good to do my leveling there after <br/>
all. Once I have a Kunark bind point I can move back and forth <br/>
quickly enough.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Any higher level tailors out there? I am lvl 70 in tailoring, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; working toward making Halfling tailored and imbued armor. I am a<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 29 halfling druid, able so far to brew and smith the various<br/>
&gt; &gt; parts I have needed to make my reinforced leather armor. I am <br/>
soon to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be off to Kunark to obtain my brute hides. Anyone been a brute<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunter, who can give me any advice?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; High quality ore drops off of pickclaw warriors and raiders in<br/>
&gt; Highpass/Highkeep (I can never keep it straight which is called <br/>
which). You<br/>
&gt; would need a group at your level. Since you are a druid, people <br/>
would really<br/>
&gt; want you in group there. Sow can be cast. And if you have regen and <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; beneficial spells they will love you. Especially since you can <br/>
heal. If you<br/>
&gt; have coin to spend, go to highkeep and auction to buy high quality <br/>
ore.<br/>
&gt; There are usually some players who will part with it. I think the <br/>
small<br/>
&gt; bricks go for around 5pp and the large bricks around 10pp.<br/>
&gt; You too!<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
