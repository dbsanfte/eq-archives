<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Its not that hard to solo in the Overthere if you 
are a ranger. It&#39;s not hard in the Dreadlands either. Just pull the mob to a 
safe place and fear kite animals or bow kite. I agree about Frontier Moutains, 
it&#39;s too dangerous to solo there. Unless you can find a good place to pull to 
you definately shouldn&#39;t fight out in the open. </font></div>

  wrote:<br>&gt; My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings 
  toward <br>game <br>&gt; death, and raised my curiosity. What are other 
  player&#39;s attitudes <br>&gt; toward game death?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I play solo 
  most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on <br>&gt; since Wave of 
  Change faded away. So, death, especially death in <br>&gt; awkward 
  circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t <br>just <br>&gt; call 
  on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor <br>do&nbsp; 
  <br>&gt; have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big 
  <br>&gt; nasty.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves 
  corpses all over the <br>&gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have 
  great fun doing all <br>&gt; that.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; My son, on the other hand, 
  is in a powerful guild on our server. He <br>&gt; is less cautious than me, 
  but still uses sound strategy and tactics <br>&gt; and utilized his guild to 
  advance on his goals. His guild is the <br>&gt; Guardian Alliance on 
  Zeb.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing 
  soon, but <br>enjoy <br>&gt; my independence enough that I want to do so as 
  late in my career as <br>&gt; possible. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Barto 
  Proudfoot<br><br>Death is something I try to avoid.&nbsp; I made Locate and 
  Corpse hotkeys <br>early on for corpse runs.&nbsp; But I hate the XP 
  loss.&nbsp; I died 3 times <br>last week, which added another 2 days before I 
  reached 38.&nbsp; I have no <br>guild or high level friends to depend either, 
  so I go where I know I <br>can get back to.&nbsp; But I do have a Druid cousin 
  that jumps me around <br>when he&#39;s on.&nbsp; So spend a few minutes scouting 
  before you jump in!&nbsp; <br>Learn from your mistakes!<br><br>Once you get to 
  Kunark your solo career is limited.&nbsp; There are just <br>too many mob&#39;s 
  and too big a chance of a bad pull.&nbsp; I have seen <br>Druids quadkiting in 
  the OT and I saw one go down on an overpull.&nbsp; It <br>helps to group until 
  you get a feel for the area.&nbsp; And watch out for <br>the Goons in 
  OT!<br><br>Tuldayen Grimblade<br>38th Season Ranger of
