&gt; The XP Penalties/bonuses break down as follow:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Human gets a 20% XP bonus over other races - all other races (Warrior class<br/>
&gt; to avoid class penalty) gain xp at the same rate (unless one of the<br/>
&gt; following applies)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hybrids take a 20% xp penalty<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; XP giving kills in a &quot;dungeon&quot; zone give a 25% xp bonus<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it is much more complicated then that, on eqrangers there have<br/>
been many and varied tests and huge discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an odd one for you from about 2 weeks back. Glunk level 17 SK (a<br/>
hybrid) and Obah level 16 Shaman (not a hybrid) both trolls, we kill a<br/>
green. Glunk gets XP, Obah doesn&#39;t ?<br/>
<br/>
One of the better posts on the lists I will post here.<br/>

Have been doing some testing with a friend of mine, playing our dwarves?<br/>
Both dwarfs, both just made 19 at the start of the test(withing one mob<br/>
of<br/>
each other), both fighting grouped exactly the same things(in the same<br/>
group of only two). I tried to eliminate all factors i could, he is a<br/>
paladin , i am a warrior. I current have 19 and 4 bubbles of exp, he has<br/>
19<br/>
and 2 bubbles of experience. So , if someone tells me there is no hybrid<br/>
penalty hehe, tell my friend. This is after about 4 hours of testing,<br/>
fighting &quot;yellow&quot; orcs in oasis.<br/>

note. I thought getting 2 bubbles of xp at 19 in 4 hours was quite<br/>
impressive, 4 is downright scary.<br/>
<br/>
Some have even said various race/class combos cop penalties.<br/>
ie. a woodelf ranger cops one of the largest penalties in the game for<br/>
being race well suited to a hybrid. Even using the primitive rule of 20%<br/>
for race and 20% for hybrid is depending on how they work it is 40% or<br/>
44% extra slug to get a level. btw. I usually hear 25% penalty for<br/>
hybrid ?<br/>
<br/>
Yet on the spoilers sites someone produced a list of the order of xp<br/>
penalties (prolly just made up), where they said particular races had<br/>
more or less penalty, with only hybrids copping a class penalty? Yet<br/>
others say there is certain hard levels for certain classes (in addition<br/>
to the hell levels which I believe are 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 ?).<br/>
<br/>
No one actually does know for certain. Except to say there are penalties<br/>
for both race and hybrids. Oh dying alot is a big penalty ..... that I<br/>
do know.<br/>
