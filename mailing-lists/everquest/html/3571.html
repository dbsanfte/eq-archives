&gt; Thanks for the help and advice but it mysteriously<br/>
&gt; came <br/>
&gt; back to life last night as if nothing ever happened!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Damn computers! The problem was that I couldn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; get <br/>
&gt; to a point where I could run the system restore<br/>
&gt; option. <br/>
&gt; As I start up the first thing I see is the Dell<br/>
&gt; splash <br/>
&gt; screen then it would proceed into booting up<br/>
&gt; windows. <br/>
&gt; Well it would get passed the Dell screen and then <br/>
&gt; immediately go to a white screen telling me it<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; find any drives. Usually one can boot off a floppy<br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; CDRom, I couldn&#39;t even do that! Being a laptop and<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; drives are interchangeable, I wasn&#39;t even getting<br/>
&gt; power <br/>
&gt; to the other drives. I was figuring something went<br/>
&gt; wrong <br/>
&gt; with the SCSI management on a hardware basis and<br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; the only repair option was to send it in. I hadn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; contacted Dell yet, I was mostly venting and<br/>
&gt; throwing a <br/>
&gt; fit. ;-) When I went to Dell&#39;s site to chat with<br/>
&gt; support <br/>
&gt; the stupid thing started working again and has been<br/>
&gt; fine <br/>
&gt; ever since. I uninstalled SP3 though!<br/>
&gt; My level is pretty good, thanks for the<br/>
&gt; consideration, <br/>
&gt; not to many people are that way anymore. I&#39;m getting<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ready to test on my Win2k MCSE so wish me luck! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks again!<br/>
