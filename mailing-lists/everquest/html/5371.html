I finally did it!<br>I failed a combine a couple times and lost two runed sea shells (which were<br>the most expensive thing I had to buy for it-- I tried hunting in SG but<br>didn&#39;t have any luck). I got my JC to 173, my tailoring to 176, fletching to<br>180, brewing to 184, pottery to 154, and smithing to 112. I got impatient on<br>the pottery and just asked someone to put the water and the velium powder<br>(made from the runed sea shell and a small brick of velium in a mortar and<br>pestle-- no fail combine) in a pottery wheel and got my Unfired Rune. I<br>fired the rune. I bought a geerlok gemsetter. Borrowed a geerlok planing<br>tool for my fletching for the combines. and borrowed a geerlok sewing
 kit<br>for the final combine. Had C3 on and success!!<br>I now have my Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl!<br>Now I need to work on JC and Smithing some more for my 8th shawl...<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br>---<br>Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br>Checked by AVG anti-virus system (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.grisoft.com)./">http://www.grisoft.com).</a><br>Version: 6.0.544 / Virus Database: 338 - Release Date: 11/25/2003<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com/">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
