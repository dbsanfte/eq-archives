Subject: [EverQuest] Rolling for loot<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
  Since there&#39;s been a lot of talk on loot order, I thoguht I&#39;d ask what<br/>
everyone<br/>
uses as a fair assesment for Rolling for loot or how one determines who gets<br/>
a<br/>
particular item.<br/>
<br/>
  What I found that seemed to be working well is Blackjack Rolls.  Someone a<br/>
long<br/>
while back showed this to me.  Basically you roll from 1 to 30.  The person<br/>
closest<br/>
to 21 without going over wins.   This seems to even out those who<br/>
consistantly average<br/>
low rolls in the 1-100 randoms.  In over 2 years of playing and using the<br/>
random 1-100<br/>
i&#39;ve never won or came close to an upper limit.   With blackjack random or<br/>
even a<br/>
raondom 1-100 and the closest to 50 is the winner, seems to average things<br/>
out.  <br/>
<br/>
  The problem with this is that most people (especially those that seemingly<br/>
roll high)<br/>
love the 1-100 random.  When I suggest the mid range win or blackjack roll,<br/>
the first <br/>
time they lose to it, they want to go back to the 1-100 again.  <br/>
<br/>
  What do you all use as a random or what &#39;rules&#39; do you use for<br/>
distributing the good<br/>
loot or when using Random?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ciao,<br/>
<br/>
 -Knight   - I still like BlackJack rolls.  I can&#39;re remember the guys name<br/>
that first<br/>
            showed it to me though.  :(<br/>
