<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017513006">The bit about people not listening is a big problem. Sometimes I think maybe<br/>
people are trying to listen but miss things bc of spell messages. So maybe<br/>
have people turn off spell messages. And others hits. Or have those things<br/>
put in a seperate chat window and pushed out of the way. Other than that,<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what to do.<br/>

&gt;      I need help from any of you High End gamers.  My guild is quickly<br/>
 </span></blockquote>growing,  and starting to do Higher level raids.  Many of our members have<br/>
not had much experience raiding, so we have been doing &quot;training&quot; raids.  We<br/>
are still having people not listening, and ending up causing TPW&#39;s.  If any<br/>
of you have any Guids to raiding,  and/or rules that your guild has,  please<br/>
send them to me so I can design something tailored to my guild.<br/>

bonus that a cougar claw earring may drop form a few of them =D<br/>
