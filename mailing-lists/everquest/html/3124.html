&gt; &gt; Another class that might be good is shadowknight. The drawbacks:<br/>
&gt; Good races<br/>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want to kill you. If<br/>
&gt; you play a<br/>
&gt; &gt; darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally suck but you get<br/>
&gt; pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; cool armor when you can manage to find all the stuff you need for<br/>
&gt; it. People<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they think of tanks. They don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; often<br/>
&gt; &gt; invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they get the spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon a pet to tank<br/>
&gt; for you<br/>
&gt; &gt; while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, and you get a<br/>
&gt; spell that<br/>
&gt; &gt; snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can solo alot and are a<br/>
&gt; good<br/>
&gt; &gt; asset to a group. Way later in the game you get to summon your own<br/>
&gt; horse<br/>
&gt; &gt; called an Unholy Steed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My brother started a shadowknight and got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br/>
