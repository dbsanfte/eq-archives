<b>Subject:</b> Underwater dw gob city in lake rathe <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-441616905">the other day as my friends and I were killing aviak guards in lakerathe<br/>
we came upon a passageway under 3 bird island, I stripped off my<br/>
equipment and let someone else hold it, got an enduring breath and went<br/>
down to explore, inside it opened up into a large underwater cavern, the<br/>
only structure I found within was what appreared to be a tower guarded<br/>
by 6 dw gobs with a trausre chest inside and something else I didn&#39;t get<br/>
a look at, does anyone know anything about this? I would sure like to<br/>
know more, from what I&#39;ve heard from the few people who&#39;ve even heard of<br/>
it, it leads to a dw gob city. if anyone knows anything about it please<br/>
e-mail me, I also have screenshots of what I saw. thanks.</div>
