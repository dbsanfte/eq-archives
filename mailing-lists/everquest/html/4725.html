<div id="ygrps-yiv-953350403">The newbie server would be a good place for something<br/>
like this I think.  I have a lvl 3 human freeport<br/>
based monk there that I&#39;d want to use.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I&#39;m tired of my post 60 struggle with my<br/>
fenin ro monk, but read the news of exp changes and<br/>
soloing with interest.  I&#39;m also interested in the<br/>
news that some of the PoP zones are opening up based<br/>
on level instead of the stupid keys.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have opinions about where a 60+ monk can<br/>
reasonably solo?  So far I&#39;ve only tried my old sol b<br/>
stomping ground since the June 11 patch, but the exp<br/>
still sucks.  Maybe chardok, or CT?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an inch away from giving the game up and working<br/>
on my chess skills, so a way to breathe life back into<br/>
it would be great.  I don&#39;t care that eq is a massive<br/>
multiplayer universe... I like to be able to solo dang<br/>
it.<br/>
