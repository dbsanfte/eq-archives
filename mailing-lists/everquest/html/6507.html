3rd and 4th shawls before they changed the way things worked with <br/>
finding the little dwarf in the snow instead of triggering the death <br/>
squad. I managed to get the 8th shawl after two years of raising my <br/>
skills. Sadly by that time, the stats weren&#39;t really worth the <br/>
effort anymore. But I still wore it. If Sony hadn&#39;t terminated my <br/>
account due to their own billing errors I&#39;d probably still be using <br/>
it.<br/>
