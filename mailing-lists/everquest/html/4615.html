<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181036740">Hi<br/>
As a newb, its hard not to feel a little intimidated by the <br/>
discussions here. I am in AWE of you people even though I don&#39;t <br/>
understand half of what you say. I long for the day when I can talk <br/>
about the finer ponts of EQ like you guys. <br/>
<br/>
For the moment I have a love/hate relationship with EQ after playing <br/>
for about two months or so. Its a type of game I have never <br/>
experienced before - I am totally fascinated and mildly (well, at the <br/>
moment!) addicted. The game boths thrills and scares me. I find <br/>
myself nervously approaching the PC every night mentally preparing <br/>
myself for the dangers ahead. Once I&#39;m in, I am immersed. GET THAT <br/>
LEVEL UP is my only goal.<br/>
<br/>
When I levelled 10 I knew that I was going to have to deal with REAL <br/>
dying and corpse retrieval. Boy, that was - and still is  - a <br/>
learning experience. The first few times I got so depressed that I <br/>
vowed to give up and cancel my subscription. But I crawled to lvl 11 <br/>
and am much more careful about conning.<br/>
<br/>
By nature I am not a team player so grouping is still a bit alien to <br/>
me although I realise its the only fast way to get xp. But too often <br/>
I find myself in groups that just gung ho for everything in sight <br/>
hitting anything that moves (= Excelsis having to retrive his corpse <br/>
ONCE more in some weird, out of the way loc).<br/>
<br/>
Can I ask you guys some questions? I reckon a 1/5 bub a night is <br/>
pretty average to aim for. That would lvl me up once a week. Is that <br/>
the norm? How long did it take you in the beginning?<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to solo in Black Burrow but that is well nigh impossible <br/>
on your own. Grouping is the only way but I HATE that place so much <br/>
it makes me so nervous to go there. I am soloing in West Kerana but <br/>
grizzly and giant spider spawns are pretty rare so I spend a lot of <br/>
time hanging around and trying to avoid the bandits (by the way, they <br/>
seem to be walking all over WK recently,  not just around their huts. <br/>
Is this new?)<br/>
<br/>
Any advice and encouragement you can give me is greatly appreciated. <br/>
I know I&#39;m not alone, but sometimes it feels as though I am! I use <br/>
the English server Venril Sathir (I live in Amsterdam) and sometimes <br/>
the zones are completely deserted. Is it like that on the US servers <br/>
as well?<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from some of you anyway, especially your experiences and <br/>
feelings about EQ when you first started. I&#39;m off again now to that <br/>
HUGE VAST world that we all know and love (and sometimes hate...)<br/>
