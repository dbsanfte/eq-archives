<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596164416"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; People don&#39;t listen because they don&#39;t want to listen,<br/>
&gt; plain and simple.  It is the biggest problem in raiding,<br/>
&gt; by far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree. Maybe some people don&#39;t want to listen but not all. Some people<br/>
try very hard but because of lag or too much spam miss things.<br/>
I had problems on my first raid to Hate because I kept missing messages<br/>
because I kept getting spammed with too many spell messages and at the time,<br/>
didn&#39;t know how to turn them off. I also lagged and did not receive messages<br/>
in time to take action.<br/>
Maybe people get distracted sometimes. But it is just a game. Real life can<br/>
interfere.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The best way to get attention and keep attention is to<br/>
&gt; boot people from raids that don&#39;t listen.  Have a person<br/>
&gt; wandering off after repeated tells to stay in camp, TL<br/>
&gt; him/her out.  It&#39;s the easiest way to get their<br/>
&gt; attention.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would only work if they accepted the TL.<br/>
And I would never use that tactic with my own guildies. That&#39;s just rude.<br/>
It&#39;s a game. It should be fun. And yeah, getting wiped out from someone not<br/>
listening isn&#39;t very fun, but I think it&#39;s even less fun to be nasty to<br/>
people.<br/>
