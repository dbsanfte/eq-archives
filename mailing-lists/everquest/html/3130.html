<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-896848520">Basically they just work as a couple and fight together. They agree to be<br/>
fighting partners and such. I recently got to perform a wedding as I was the<br/>
only available cleric the couple could find. :-) The ceremony was short but<br/>
sweet. And then they passed around wedding cake and cookies. My parting gift<br/>
to them was the blessing of Heroic Bond. :-)<br/>
Beyond that I don&#39;t know much more as I never do the dating type of<br/>
roleplay. I just don&#39;t know how.<br/>
