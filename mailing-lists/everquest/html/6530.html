<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166310059">What is a Drak? And how many expansions are there now?<br/>
I couldn&#39;t get back into it even if I really wanted to<br/>
because there is no way in hell I could download the<br/>
patches and such with my connection. I&#39;ve got<br/>
Hughes.net Satellite and it totally blows. They have a<br/>
limit on how much I can download per day and there are<br/>
all sorts of problems with their software that makes<br/>
the &#39;net stop working.<br/>
When I play World of Warcraft my latency is around<br/>
1200ms on a good day. Most of the time its over 1500ms<br/>
and its not unusual to have 2300ms.<br/>
Have they fixed zoning, damage misreporting, or the<br/>
memory leaks in EQ?<br/>
Too bad its been so long that my characters are not<br/>
really worth much now. I&#39;d be tempted to sell them so<br/>
they could go on being played by someone else.<br/>
Plus some natural disasters have left me with<br/>
financial problems. :-(<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; the only place I saw<br/>
