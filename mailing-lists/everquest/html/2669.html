<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I just noticed recently that I seem to be running 
into more women while running around Norrath. I mean characters played by women, 
is there any truth to this, or did I just not care in the past and didn&#39;t 
notice? That would be really cool if it were true. </font></div><br></font></div></html></div>
