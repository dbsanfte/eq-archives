<b>Subject:</b> RE: Fed up with EQ - any ideas?? - Rant <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358383668">Interesting suggestions. Here&#39;s my thoughts on them (not that it means<br/>
much).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. I find the durability idea interesting. It would add to the player<br/>
economy if someone could specialize in its repair.. and I&#39;m sure you will<br/>
find many a player that would want to study these arts.  I definitely agree<br/>
that something has to be done to increase the value of money.  What I find<br/>
in today&#39;s EQ world are campers that are trading to other campers.. forcing<br/>
every other player to then in turn become campers themselves..  This in<br/>
combination with the fact that only jewelers actually need cash, gems etc.<br/>
purchased from merchants, if your not in the market for enchanted jewelry<br/>
then your cash is worthless.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that they have created these new class specific rubi replacements, they<br/>
have at least attempted to change that.  Example.. Being a ranger myself, in<br/>
order to complete my quest for the Ivy bracer I have to purchase a stone<br/>
valued at 120p.. then another for a second bracer. It does add to the<br/>
economy a bit but.. the problem is the money I spend is not going back into<br/>
the general population... its going to the merchants.. ack :(.<br/>
<br/>
Durability is an interesting idea sounds plausible to me.<br/>
<br/>
2.  As for the idea of horses and the such.. I once thought this was a great<br/>
idea; however, the EQ world as it is.. Is just to small for such modes of<br/>
transport. Now if they could increase that land mass abit and make zones<br/>
much larger, as in AC then I might agree.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Binds in the city without going to casters for help.  Sounds good when<br/>
you first hear it; however I kinda like the idea of somehow supplying newbie<br/>
casters some income.  I remember really hurting for cash with one of my mage<br/>
characters.  In the beginning spells cost a ton to the average newbie.  I<br/>
like it the way it is.  The one thing I want?  My ranger would have the<br/>
ability to gate.. I know that a ring does exist,&quot;Glimmer Ring&quot;, which allows<br/>
me to gate.. only thing is, it works once.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Rubi, Rubi, Rubi,  personally I hate rubi.. hehe...  I think its<br/>
wonderful that they have added additional sets of armor, plus the fact its<br/>
class specific.  It would be a truly boring place if everyone was decked out<br/>
in all red.  I have to say the newly created no drop item quest for class<br/>
specific armor, was a godsend.  Lets look at the pluses:<br/>
<br/>
a.  Armor tailored for a class with stats helping to further balance the<br/>
classes overall.<br/>
<br/>
b.  Items for quest are no drop, therefore if you want the armor you pretty<br/>
much have to loot the items yourself. This minimizes the camping by casters<br/>
who are in it just for the money.  I hate having to lower myself to<br/>
trade/buy an item from some caster, that could never use it to being with,<br/>
whom probably KS&#39;d it from someone who really needed it.<br/>
<br/>
c.  Quest items are also spread out across the entire world forcing players<br/>
to move about the zones.<br/>
<br/>
d.  Each armor piece requires the actual spending of money, ill be it to the<br/>
merchants :(, and this is good to increase the overall value of the<br/>
platinum.<br/>
<br/>
e.  The quest are, from what I have experienced, quite sufficiently<br/>
difficult.  When teamed with a nice group they can be completed, however if<br/>
you want to solo you better be ready to dish it out.. hehe<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Overall nice suggestions, and these are just my thoughts on the matter..<br/>
