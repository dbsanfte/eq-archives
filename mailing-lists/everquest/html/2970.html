<div id="ygrps-yiv-728872826">ditto that, the merchants wont buy back unfired and it&#39;s not economical to<br/>
buy the firing sheets to make them sellable. I mastered pottery in about 3<br/>
for around the same amout of plat, did it in NFP though while I was selling<br/>
so that&#39;s prolly why it took me longer :)<br/>

Tailoring (sigh), now that&#39;s time consuming and expensive. I&#39;m up to Wu&#39;s<br/>
and those coldain tempers are costing me an arm and  a leg. I&#39;d just try<br/>

&gt; Pottery:  Make medium *unfired* bowls from 1-122. Will cost no more than<br/>
&gt; 25PP.  Just destroy the unfired bowls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pottery is, by far, the easiest and cheapest tradeskill to master.  I did<br/>
