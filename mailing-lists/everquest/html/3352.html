<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-782361687">I have done the shovel of ponz quest and I have all of the <br/>
ingredients for the other 3 focus items there is one for each pet <br/>
type. There is a torch, stein, broom, and shovel you have to get <br/>
these from Najena they drop off of mages there. for the shovel you <br/>
need a ruby, eyes from a gargoyle(you can buy these), hill giant toes <br/>
and the shovel from najena take them to the temple of solusk ro and <br/>
turn them into Vira and she will give you the shovel of Ponz. you <br/>
dont lose it and you cant trade it it has stats and boosts your earth <br/>
pet. you just need it in your hand when you cast your earth pet then <br/>
you can take it out and use another weapon, or you can just leave it <br/>
in your hand ....I wouldnt consider doin this quest until lvl 20 and <br/>
have some friends with you ...Najena can get sticky some times.</div>
