<br>They sometimes will drop a couple PP and they also drop fine steel weapons 
<br>that sell from 4 to 6PP each. &nbsp;So a couple hours there will give you some PP. 
<br>&nbsp;Of course nothing like the PP you would need to afford some of the 
<br>outrageously expensive items I see going for auctions in the EC tunnel. &nbsp;

<br>inspecting others but I read about how others have allot of money and was
<br>unsure how they did this. I do not like to twink my characters I think the
<br>fun is in earning what you get not being given to you by others. So I was
<br>just interested in how others made $ in EQ(i.e.. selling things, helping
<br>higher level PC, etc...) &nbsp;It has been nice to see others in the same
<br>position thanks for &nbsp;the responses</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial">
