&gt; Corruption.<br/>

&gt; I assume that is updated when a character commits an offense against<br/>
&gt; his home town like attacking a member of one of their allies or, worse<br/>
&gt; still, attacking someone in his own city. Please correct me if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; wrong about that.<br/>

&gt; My corruption stat is 15. Is there a way to remove corruption?<br/>
