<b>Subject:</b> Cleric Weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499718448">Does anyone have an opinion on what is the best weapon for Clerics?<br/>
I have been told that Clerics will always have a high miss rate so I should<br/>
get a Screaming Mace because the attack is low.<br/>
However, I have also seen that a lot of the higher lvl clerics carry a<br/>
crooked staff.<br/>
Any feedback would be appreciated.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
