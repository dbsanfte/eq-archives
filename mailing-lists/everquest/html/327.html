<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270546452">Yeah, I&#39;ve noticed the same thing. And Have you also noticed that blue cons<br/>
are *A lot* tougher sometimes than others. Im at lvl8 Barbarian Shaman.<br/>
<br/>
In blackburrow sometimes i take a blue con gnoll and lose maybe 1bubble of<br/>
hp, then other times i die from the same lvl con. <br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has come to the conclusion that you are weakest at point<br/>
right<br/>
before leveling and right after leveling. And that in the middle of a lvl<br/>
you are the<br/>
strongest. It makes sense, think about it. when do you die most often from<br/>
easy <br/>
cons? Right before you hit your lvl and right after you get it.<br/>

&gt; The xp loss on death thing seems to be one of the greatest mysteries of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; game.  I&#39;m a LVL 11 (REAL close to 12) Bard - been spending the last<br/>
&gt; several<br/>
&gt; levels hitting Orc an Dervish camps.  I&#39;ve been getting killed by these<br/>
&gt; critters (mostly con blue and white) and of course the obligatory deaths<br/>
&gt; due<br/>
&gt; to Griffins and Sand Giants.  Last night got killed by a Ghoul in befallen<br/>
&gt; (not sure if that is red or yellow)...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am almost to the conclusion that they use a random number generator.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes I see a significant loss (close to if not a half-bubble)<br/>
&gt; sometimes<br/>
&gt; it seems that I&#39;ve barely lost any.  Seems like I usually lose a lot when<br/>
&gt; getting chomped by the super-high-level ones (Griff/SG) and often not a<br/>
&gt; lot<br/>
&gt; when its close to level as me (blue/white)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also - anecdotally it seems that if you die after dying recently you lose<br/>
&gt; more for that death than otherwise.  Perhaps some sort of timer?  But of<br/>
&gt; course - this could be coincidence - or again the random xp loss theory<br/>
&gt; could come into play here to...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I brought up this subject on the Stratics EQ chat room (irc.stratics.com<br/>
&gt; #Everquest) and it was pretty much agreed that the level of the MOB that<br/>
&gt; kill you has, at least, some effect on experience loss.  In fact, a couple<br/>
&gt; of the higher level players in the chat room (both of them claimed to be<br/>
&gt; 30+) came back with an absolute YES.  The thinking is that at lower levels<br/>
&gt; (say 6-15), the level of MOB that would probably kill you is going to be<br/>
&gt; higher than you.  At these levels, &quot;blues&quot; are not difficult to defeat.<br/>
&gt; At<br/>
&gt; higher levels, MOBS than con blue to you (meaning lower level than you)<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; far more dangerous and can easily<br/>
