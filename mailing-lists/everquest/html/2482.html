<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i really pay for four accounts every month, and i am thinking<br/>
about adding a fifth one, because i stopped playing other<br/>
&quot;systems&quot;. and no, i am not one of those people earning money<br/>
with PLing others, i do it just for the fun ... and of course<br/>
because i am very addicted to it. and no, i am not at school<br/>
or at university, i have a normal job.<br/>
<br/>
i had (maybe i even &quot;have&quot;) some more chars on other servers,<br/>
but somehow i am &quot;used&quot; to Tarew Marr. even after some friends<br/>
moved to other servers, or even legends.<br/>
<br/>
my level average on those 14 chars is between 25 and 30 (with<br/>
&quot;bilt&quot; being my main at 52), but i &quot;always&quot; lower my level<br/>
average, because i do like to play (fool) around with different<br/>
race/class/deity chars.<br/>
<br/>
if you ask me how i &quot;technically&quot; do this: i use two system for<br/>
the internet connection and three systems to actually play with.<br/>
the two internet systems are a &quot;floppy-based&quot; linux system to<br/>
actually connect to the internet and give me a firewalling and<br/>
masquerading option. the other system is a windows 2000 server<br/>
to do some internal things, and also name resolution (DNS).<br/>
<br/>
to answer the question, how i am able to control three systems<br/>
at once, there a different answers, because it depends on what<br/>
i am up to in the game: if i group with myself, a proper keyboard<br/>
setup and hotkeys, combined with the right spot to hunt at are<br/>
enough. if i go on (plane-)raids, i do it only with two chars<br/>
(can&#39;t go with a 2nd char to planes yet, because my next higher<br/>
level char is only 44).<br/>
<br/>
but it is also possible for me to group with two of my chars<br/>
with others, and the rest of the group thinks my chars belonging<br/>
to two different players. if i am in a real good mood (and awake)<br/>
i can even roleplay both of those chars.<br/>
<br/>
when i started with EQ (it was about two years ago, a few days<br/>
after it went public: it took some time to receive the shipment<br/>
in germany) i tried to connect from two systems with the same<br/>
account: got a very nasty message, so i didn&#39;t try it again.<br/>
but i realized i need a way to play it with more than one char<br/>
at the same time, so i ordered a 2nd copy. and it didn&#39;t need much<br/>
time to add the 3rd and 4th account. i only need another computer<br/>
to get all four of them online at the same time ... and i just<br/>
hope this will be soon ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
if you want to know why i did this, here is a short listing of my<br/>
usage of the four accounts:<br/>
  - #1 and #2 are for the chars i like to play and try out different<br/>
    things, like how can classes be combined<br/>
  - #3 is my &quot;porter&quot; account with a lvl 40 wizzy and a lvl 30 druid<br/>
  - #4 is my &quot;rezzer&quot; account with a lvl 44 cleric (and a low level<br/>
    cleric: 11 i believe)<br/>
<br/>
and i am working on my lvl 44 and 40 chars to get them to (at least)<br/>
50 ASAP, but because of my work i don&#39;t have the time to play every<br/>
day. this is one of the reasons, why i started to &quot;group with myself&quot;,<br/>
and also didn&#39;t join one of those ueberguilds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
better stop now ... i don&#39;t want to bore so many people with my<br/>
stories ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
have fun<br/>
