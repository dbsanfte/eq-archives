<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400804110">This is great info! Wish I had it when I started! Anyway for those newbs<br/>
that are going to start this right now the Orc Fibula is the hard item<br/>
to get. However if you come across these grab a few of them! I know you<br/>
need at least three that I can remember. The bandit&#39;s tooth can be<br/>
bought in Kelethin, unfortunately I don&#39;t remember which vendor has it.<br/>
Also if you hang around spires you may be able to pick one up after a<br/>
higher lvl player knocks off a bandit. That&#39;s how I got mine. The<br/>
fingerbones I&#39;ve found to be relatively common even at Orc hill. The<br/>
onluy thing is I think it actually depends on the lvl character going<br/>
for the items. I may be wrong on this but it&#39;s just a guess! :D<br/>

Subject: Trueshot Chainmail Ranger Quest armor<br/>
<br/>
The Trueshot Chainmail armor is a newbie armor quest in Greater Faydark.<br/>
You can find all this information on Allakhazam and EQrangers, but I<br/>
offer it here to you just for comprehensive purposes.  This armor is<br/>
wearable by half elves and wood elves, but only if your deity is Tunare.<br/>
The quest starts out in the ranger guild in Kelethin.  Hail Samatansyn<br/>
Flamecaller to start the quest.  He will give you a Trueshot Armor kit<br/>
which you will use to put specific items in and combine them to make the<br/>
mold for the armor.  Then take the pattern he gives you for the armor<br/>
piece you wish to create and combine it with the mold you made in a<br/>
forge.  My ranger is level 10 and has not failed on a single piece yet.<br/>
I just helped a level 1 ranger craft the coif and he succeeded so I<br/>
don&#39;t believe it takes any smithing skill to finish each item.  <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Most of the items can be purchased from vendors around Kelethin so<br/>
before you spend time killing mobs, try buying them first, unless you<br/>
just want the xp.  Some of the orc specific items are No Drop, which<br/>
I&#39;ll indicate by (ND).  The bricks of crude bronze are best purchased<br/>
off other players, or as I found out you can trade Crushbone belts for<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BOOTS:   (all items purchasable)<br/>
- 3 bricks crude bronze<br/>
- 1 severed orc foot<br/>
- 2 spider legs<br/>
<br/>
BRACER:  (all items purchasable)<br/>
- 1 brick crude bronze<br/>
- 1 skeleton tibia<br/>
- 1 pixie wing<br/>
- 1 gypsy wine<br/>
<br/>
COIF:  (all items purchasable)<br/>
- 2 bricks crude bronze<br/>
- 1 Royal Jelly   (drops off giant wasps)<br/>
- 1 spiderling eye<br/>
- 1 ration    (NOT Iron Ration)<br/>
<br/>
GAUNTLETS:   <br/>
- 3 bricks crude bronze<br/>
- 1 Orc Ulna (ND)<br/>
- 1 Orc Tibia (ND)<br/>
- 2 Orc Fingerbones (ND  Note: These are rare drops)<br/>
<br/>
LEGPLATES:<br/>
- 4 bricks crude bronze<br/>
- 1 Orc Fibula  (ND  Note: Very rare drop.  Drops off Orc Slavers)<br/>
- 1 Orc Clavicle (ND)<br/>
- 1 Lightstone <br/>
<br/>
SLEEVES:   (all items purchasable except venom sacks)<br/>
- 2 bricks crude bronze<br/>
- 2 giant wasp venom sacks<br/>
- 1 large window abdomen  (ND)<br/>
- 1 white wine<br/>
<br/>
TUNIC:<br/>
- 5 bricks crude bronze<br/>
- 1 Orc fibula (ND very rare)<br/>
- 1 golden bandit tooth   (note: not sure where to obtain this or what<br/>
it drops from, but I suspect the bandits in NK probably)<br/>
- 1 pristine forest drakeling scale  (note: should be purchasable but I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen one yet)<br/>
- 1 Orc Ribcage (ND)<br/>
- 1 Orc Eye (common drop, can also purchase)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest doing the gaunts, the legs, and the tunic last since the<br/>
fibulas will come the hardest.  This armor has decent stats and should<br/>
be good up until mid 20&#39;s.  You will have to go to Crushbone for the ND<br/>
items, but other than that, it&#39;s a simple quest. You can check out the<br/>
stats on Allakhazam.  It&#39;s nice looking armor too.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!!<br/>
