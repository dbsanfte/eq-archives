<b>Subject:</b> What game features would you like to see added? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857420666">Ok, we know they are adding vases, coffins, and chests that can be opened or<br/>
smashed into the game with Lost Dungeons of Norrath, but are there any other<br/>
features you would like to see added to Everquest?<br/>
Or, if you could go back in time and change something about Everquest during<br/>
it&#39;s creation to have certain features, what would you have done<br/>
differently?<br/>
Feel free to go into detail if you want. :-)<br/>
(I&#39;m extremely bored bc I injured my wrists and can&#39;t play EQ much for<br/>
awhile)<br/>
luv,<br/>
