I put in a Geforce 2TI 64 meg card for the SOL upgrade.  I found it <br/>
to be a big improvement over my Geforce 256.  I&#39;m looking at getting <br/>
a Geforce 4 in the summer.<br/>

And PCI cards are getting hard to find.  You should look online, like <br/>
Yahoo shopping, and see what&#39;s out there.<br/>
