<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809806118">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll find a local group of people that play everquest <br/>
since it&#39;s an online community. Don&#39;t let distance stop you from making <br/>
friends though, because there are some great people who play this game <br/>
from all over the world. I&#39;ve made friends with a bard from Israel and <br/>
a druid from England, and I currently live in NYC. If you or anyone is <br/>
on Stromm and needs some help or is looking to make friends just send <br/>
an ingame /tell to Karrola 70 beastlord. I also am co-leader of a <br/>
friendship based guild on stromm and we can help you learn the game and <br/>
get some basic gear to start with.<br/>

&gt; Well wanted to say hello to all. Just joined today! Also started<br/>
&gt; playing Everquest like a few days ago. So I hope that this group would<br/>
&gt; enhance my game playing. One more thing, I wanted to know how I can<br/>
&gt; look for local Everquest groups. I live in Brooksville, FL. So if<br/>
&gt; anyone has any ideas, please let me know. Thanks.<br/>
