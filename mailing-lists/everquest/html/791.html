<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348356744">I would have to say that normally people don&#39;t just give away oracle robes<br/>
and staffs of writhing.� However in today&#39;s EQ world its hard to cast a<br/>
stone and not hit a twinked player unfortunately.� It all depends on who you<br/>
know.� Most of the items twinked players wear and/or use really doesn&#39;t<br/>
effect their play much.� What level you are has a greater effect via skills<br/>
learned and abilities mastered, then what you wear.� Wear what you want<br/>
doesn&#39;t really matter.� =)<br/>

does a 30 enchanter in an oracle robe with a staff of writhing, a few<br/>
quested items, and silversilk leggings sound twinked? Just curious, cause I<br/>
keep getting handed free stuff... (people helped me on quests but i did most<br/>
of the stuff)<br/>
