<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490572508">For the record, this forum is not for trading accounts. While this isn&#39;t as<br/>
annoying as the ones where people ask for real money for their account, I am<br/>
now requesting that no further account trades/sales be advertised on this<br/>
list.<br/>
Why am I against the trading? I have heard of people who bought accounts and<br/>
then got screwed by the account holder. Maybe I&#39;m just paranoid, but it is<br/>
still not a safe thing to do for the person who wants to get the account.<br/>
So no more of this.<br/>

No, I am not selling this account for money.<br/>
But I have a 40 shaman account (on the nameless server) and am done<br/>
with it. I do not want to keep paying for it, as I never use it, but<br/>
I feel funny about just letting it.die. So, I&#39;d like someone that<br/>
could use it to take it over. Now, I am looking for some sort of<br/>
compensation. NO real money, but a donation to my guild in the way of<br/>
platinum or gear would be well considered. Do not ask me how much or<br/>
what items - I don&#39;t know. If you are interested, just send an email<br/>
to me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:z_elder@...">z_elder@...</a> saying &quot;I would like to donate 25k to your<br/>
cause in exchange for the account&quot;  or whatever.<br/>
