say that I too have made the switch, haven&#39;t touched EQ since DAoC came 
out.&nbsp; Dark Age has had the benefit of hindsight and learning from EQ&#39;s 
mistakes.&nbsp; They have built upon them.&nbsp; There is less downtime, more 
character specialization, less annoying corpse runs, better graphics, easier 
grouping, and better pvp.&nbsp; DAoC is better than EQ currently, however, to 
EQ&#39;s credit -- Dark Age wouldn&#39;t be what it is if it hadn&#39;t been for EQ&#39;s 
experience.</font></span></div>

like EQ, I think you&#39;ll like Dark Age if not as much, perhaps better.&nbsp; The 
only drawback is that you need a pretty high-end system for smooth play 
(particularly a good graphics card).</font></span></div>

  has been playing it. &nbsp;In fact, after a few days, he cancelled his EQ 
  account and is solely playing DAoC. &nbsp;He keeps telling me to try it but I 
  tell him I like EQ just fine. &nbsp;From watching him, I can tell I don&#39;t 
  wanna play. &nbsp;BUT he&#39;s a hardcore gamer and EQ and Solitaire are the only 
  games I play. &nbsp;He says it&#39;s like EQ but better. &nbsp; <br><br>Lena
