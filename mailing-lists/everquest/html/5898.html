2hs is bigger hits but usually less aggro, useful for when you&#39;re not the MT<br/>
of a group or raid but want to get your licks in anyway. 1hs is faster,<br/>
typically more aggro, and allows you to use a shield for bash.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] 1HS vs 2HS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Greetings....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been playing EQ for a long time, played nearly every class<br/>
&gt; with most races. I feel I am knowledgeable about many things in<br/>
&gt; regards to each class, race, etc. Yet, there is the one question<br/>
&gt; that evades me.. For the &quot;Knight&quot; classes, (Shadowknights and<br/>
&gt; Paladins), what is better..the traditional 1hs or the 2hs. I have<br/>
&gt; seen people, including my friends who do 2hs, and some that do 1hs.<br/>
&gt; What are the pros and cons of each...so I can decide which way to go<br/>
&gt; with my new pally...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks<br/>
