<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836298740">heh.. that&#39;s funny -- you guys killing mobs that have no chance <br/>
against you.  I&#39;ve had some fun myself.  I went to the derv sites in <br/>
nro and I bumped into my friend I haven&#39;t seen for a looong time.  It <br/>
was great seeing him again.  We bumped into each other at derv3 i <br/>
think?  I don&#39;t remember.  Haven&#39;t been to dervs for so long so I <br/>
don&#39;t remember which number is what.  Anyway, it was the one with <br/>
that DE and we creamed it.  Haha~~ it was pretty funny.  I just nuked <br/>
it once and it started running away or rather walking away hehe.  And <br/>
speaking of other fun, killing HGs or SGs is fun :)  They fall like <br/>
trees!<br/>

&gt;   Speaking of fun, my brother (lvl 27 Paladin), my guildmate (lvl <br/>
20 warr) and<br/>
&gt;   myself (lvl 29 cleric) owned Crushbone yesterday. We went in and <br/>
killed<br/>
&gt;   every single orc just for fun. There was nobody else there so we <br/>
owned the<br/>
&gt;   place. It was great!<br/>
&gt;   luv,<br/>

&gt;   &gt; I have managed to get my ranger 14 levels without getting <br/>
killed and<br/>
&gt;   &gt; my druid all the way from 1 to 21 before getting snuffed.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; My rogue on the other hand... oi!<br/>
