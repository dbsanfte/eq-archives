&gt; &quot;Are the trade skills really good and do they play a<br/>
&gt; part of succeeding at higher levels?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Here is why I ask.  My friend is a level 17 druid and<br/>
&gt; a tailor.  He can&#39;t make armor that my level 13 Ranger<br/>
&gt; can use that is worthwhile to me.  I bought some mail<br/>
&gt; boots and chest armor, which are far better than what<br/>
&gt; he can make.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am also doing pottery with my Druid and I can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; any value to this trade.  If I make 30 muffin tins, is<br/>
&gt; some baker really going to buy the lot off me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pottery is important at higher levels to make Thurgadin Gate potions.  But<br/>
pottery is, by far, the easiest skill to master, so I really wouldn&#39;t worry<br/>
about it at this point.  I mastered pottery to skill 122 in about 2 hours<br/>
with 25pp making (and destroying) unfired medium bowls.  Many of the higher<br/>
level guild are now starting to make getting pottery to 122 a requirement<br/>
just for these potions.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to do the Coldain shawl quests, then you will need to spend<br/>
large amounts of time (and plat) to get most tradeskills up to a significant<br/>
level.  There are also some rumors that tradeskills will end up being a<br/>
larger part of the new expansion.<br/>
<br/>
As a Ranger, you should work on mastering Fletching, especially if you ever<br/>
want to make the Trueshot Longbow or make your own arrows.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on how popular the new cultural armor becomes, smithing could be a<br/>
decent money maker at very high levels.  Some of the new cultural plate is<br/>
really nice (of course, there is no Karana specific chain for Rangers, just<br/>
the regular human cultural  :(  ).<br/>
<br/>
Brewing and baking could be nice with all of the stat bonus food available.<br/>
Some of the newer recipes have some nice stats on them.<br/>
