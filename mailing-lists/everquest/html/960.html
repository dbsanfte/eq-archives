<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085847057">Now i know some of you are thinking, didnt we talk about this!?<br/>
<br/>
This is my two cents on the whole deal, and im by far the best<br/>
source for this info.  But i do know a few spots to make some <br/>
money so ...<br/>
<br/>
First off, the only time you need to worry about cash is if:<br/>
1) you REALLY need the eq someone is selling/need to buy from<br/>
someone.<br/>
<br/>
2)you want to twink the hell outa your next character.<br/>
<br/>
Nuff&#39; said there, mostly its going to be 1 until you hit the<br/>
upper levels then its most 2.<br/>
<br/>
So, you cant make money at low levels.  Well, thats cause you<br/>
CANT!  deal with it.  No level 5 character can go make money<br/>
like a level 50 char can.  So start spending some time in <br/>
your favorite seat cause, your arse is gonna need to love it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -<br/>
So, i start this at about 10+.  This is based off my exsperience<br/>
so, since i was a melee class, i dont really know how this will<br/>
effect you.  And faction may just cause you to NOT be able to<br/>
do this also.<br/>
<br/>
Erud&#39;s Crossing.<br/>
  This has to be the best spot for wisp hunting.  The island<br/>
spawns non aggressive bugs, wisps, and the occasional undead.<br/>
For those SK&#39;s and necros, thats a decent plus.  You NEED!<br/>
and i cant stress the NEED enough a magical weapon.  I always<br/>
made sure my monk had magical gloves as soon as he could take<br/>
the frogloks in the sewers of Qeynos.  So, Head on over to<br/>
Qeynos, its the first stop on the way to Erudin.  They have<br/>
a vedor on the island.  <br/>
  Pick up a spit, a fishing rod, and may some grubs for the trip<br/>
there.  Work that cooking skill up a bit before you leave.<br/>
Look to get a bind at the docks in Qeynos, or if a caster bind<br/>
at the docks on the Crossing.<br/>
  Why a spit!?  Why the rod?<br/>
You want to minimize the costs while here and maximize the<br/>
income!  Fish while resting at the docks, use the spit to<br/>
make fish cakes, and eat that rather then buy over priced food.<br/>
<br/>
Now then - Simply put, hunt wisps night and day.<br/>
I try to avoid groups like the plague except when i find some<br/>
one that complements me, a healer for melee and melee for<br/>
casters.  The wisps are good for atleast 4 levels of money.<br/>
Up until 15, last i remember do they give you experience.<br/>
If they changed this, let me know cause i was thinking of<br/>
starting a new character.<br/>
<br/>
  Thats basicly it from 10-15, ill work on a good spot for 15+<br/>
for the next post.  <br/>
  Anyone car argue, but to prove me wrong is something else.<br/>
So if you dont think this is a good spot, start a character<br/>
and TRY IT YOURSELF!  Dont complain to me ...</div>
