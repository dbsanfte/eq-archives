you so you can hunt more of them in less time. :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Made my way to Kunark, and decided to try Warsliks Woods for brutes<br/>
&gt; to begin my adventure. As a Halfling tailor, brute hides are a<br/>
&gt; valuable next step in tailoring. My son recalled finding brutes in<br/>
&gt; the tunnel to Dalnir, so I went there. Once I do an initial harmony<br/>
&gt; to draw only one, I am able to root, dot, dot, root, nuke with<br/>
&gt; surprising ease. With a respawn of about 15 minutes I can keep<br/>
&gt; farming these for quite a while as I build my tailoring skills making<br/>
&gt; Halfling Vale leather armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Experience is not great, but since I will be working on trade skills<br/>
&gt; as I farm, the time making lvl 34 will be well spent here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once I have gotten tired of farming here I will try Frontier<br/>
&gt; Mountains.<br/>
