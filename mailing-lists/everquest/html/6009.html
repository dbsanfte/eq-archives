<div id="ygrps-yiv-711250911">I suppose a slower way of PLing someone would be to give them a good HP buff and then let them fight but heal them and maybe root the mob if it tries to run. This way the person will have to do all the damage.<br/>

One more thing to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming you get PL&#39;d to 40+, your skills will only be maybe level 20 if that.  In order to raise your skills you have to practice them on mobs that you still get xp from.  Your skills don&#39;t increase unless the mob is at least light blue.  Skilsl like divination and conjuration can be worked while sitting in POK just repeatedly casting them over again.  Skills like Abjuration and alteration will go up just by repeatedly buffing people, which you can also sit in POK and do.  BUT, the big skill, Evocation doesn&#39;t go up unless you&#39;re actually killing mobs.  And that&#39;s where it&#39;s gonna hurt you.  <br/>
<br/>
I find as a druid, my least commonly used skill is divination. Divination is Invis and See Invis.  spirit of Eagle and Flight of Eagles has See Invis included.  so you may want to work Invis because it comes in handy in the higher levels.  <br/>
<br/>
As a druid, probably your most commonly used combat skill is Conjuration since you will primarily be using DOTs.  Mix in a heaping of Evocation for nukes and you can raise them pretty quick, but only if you&#39;re getting xp for the mob, and as has been pointed out, that&#39;s very hard to do if you&#39;re PL&#39;d<br/>

I have to agree with all that&#39;s said here and add a little, there&#39;s 2 ways to PL someone from what I&#39;ve seen, the way they&#39;ve talked about here putting a damage shield on you and healing you as and when you need it, or taking the mob down to about 50% then you finish it off. <br/>
<br/>
Lets take the first one for example, DS and heal. the DS hurts the mob before they hit you, you don&#39;t get hit as much and usually not as hard so your defense doesn&#39;t go up. Because the DS is damaging them you don&#39;t have to hit as much as normal so your attack doesn&#39;t go up either. Yes being PL by a druid or a class equal to them will get you to 65 in a hurry but you&#39;re going to be a wimp unable to either take a hit or make a hit leading to yours and possibly your groups untimely death. You&#39;re also not going to be using your spells as much as they&#39;re going to be rooting the mobs for you.... can we say fizzle city here, you can&#39;t save your group or yourself if you can&#39;t cast once before your oom<br/>

I hate to be the one to say this but you really should focus on your battle skills. Trust me, at the lower levels that is a perfect time to get the skills built up. I can understand wanting to go in and just beat the heck out of everything and being uber and killing it all in one shot. But ponder this, When you get to be up in levels (50&#39;s, 60&#39;s, and 70&#39;s) you are going to be taking on some majorly nasty monsters. If you have just gained levels and have an uber weapon but never really worked on your fighting skills and they are low, it&#39;s not going to help you or your party out very much. Actually you will hurt your group more than help them. Now being a Shammy you have some awesome spells at higher levels. This is another thing I would suggest focusing on. If your at a higher level and your fighting say a dragon and 60% of your casts fizz <br/>
then you may as well run or be able to hit! (See first part otherwise your gonna get killed or your group killed.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my 2 cents.<br/>
