<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hey Wulf thanks man&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The song I used was not the original song&nbsp; 
that I had in mind but something completely different.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think 
Gregorian Chant form one of the Masters of Chant albums&nbsp; and the theme was 
gonna be completely different.&nbsp; But when i heard that Man O War was gonna 
be in&nbsp; Orlando I wanted to check the date to see if I&#39;d be able to make it 
down there to go seem em at the House of Blues.&nbsp; Unfortunately&nbsp; for me 
that fell on a night that I needed to be at work so&nbsp; That went out the 
window but I was kinda surprised to see that&nbsp; Man O War really wasn&#39;t that 
much&nbsp; as a group any more and i came across DSG form the Man O War Online 
Store and was pleasantly surprised to see that David Shankle&nbsp; was still 
doing music and I saw the original video for &quot;Calling All Heroes&quot; and decided to 
rework the Theme&nbsp; for the film centering around the song.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">What&#39;s bad is it took me up to this vid of the 4 or 
5 previous to figure out how to keep the shots in sync with the song lol and 
actually give people an idea of how long they were gonna need to wait in regards 
to Download time.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">And this film is literally the largest yet out of 
all my past ones.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Just as an FYI&nbsp; I had full graphics on for all 
the vid caps used in the film&nbsp; except for the use of Shadows.&nbsp; Already 
with a system that has an AMD Athlon 1.4Gig processor with 1Gig Ram and a 
Geforce 5500 FX 256MB vid card I tended to lag as you could tell by the vid caps 
and Thats with&nbsp; running WinEQ 2.0 Pro&nbsp; to play Eq all the time and 
using that proggie for the vid caps, my FPS is at anywhere between 29 to 35FPS 
out of 40 but when I turn on the shadows it takes my FPS down to almost 
nothing&nbsp; and WinEQ&nbsp;actually helps cut down cpu usage.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Once I had the viid caps I use Sorenson Squeeze to 
convert all or part of the vid caps into a workable format to be used&nbsp; in 
combining those and the stills using Flash MX 2004 Pro </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Took me forever to get the FPS for the film to be 
just right as well as figuring out how to get the last few stills to 
appear&nbsp; the way they do at the right time.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">once I had the .swf file saved i used Flash 
Optimizer to&nbsp; optimize the film&nbsp; to the least amount of&nbsp;size 
possible and not&nbsp; compromise the quality of the whole thing .&nbsp; Managed 
to get the .swf file from 100MB to 79MB Any lower and the quality of the whole 
appearance went all to hell in a hand basket and back</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh and Stephen&nbsp;&nbsp; I took care of what 
you&nbsp; mentioned and managed to get that uploaded&nbsp;and also&nbsp; fixed a 
minor blooper at the end of the film as well&nbsp; thanks for the 
input.&nbsp;</font></div>
