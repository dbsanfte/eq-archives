<div id="ygrps-yiv-276459290">Hi everyone.. i have tried to creat a new account after a long time <br/>
off of everquest but i can&#39;t find my original cd case!  I can&#39;t find <br/>
what the account number is (cd number) for the original everquest if <br/>
anyone could please post what the cd key is i would be very <br/>
thankful.  You are in no danger, i phoned a everquest help line and <br/>
they said that all the CD codes are the same so its not like i can <br/>
steal your accounts or anything... any help would be great</div>
