<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245455643">Do you all agree with the red pvp stuff? i dont, when i was just starting i gave the book to the priest *before i knew how to read it because wheni played the demo i couldn&#39;t figure it out either* and am red, and as of last night i found out another thing that will suck in the future, and i dont want to start another character because im already a level 9 necromancer, noone can cure diseases or heal me unless they are red too... this seems like overkill to me and verant needs to change some things.<br/>
