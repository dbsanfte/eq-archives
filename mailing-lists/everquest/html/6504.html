<div id="ygrps-yiv-29126341"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;Thank you. I was at 21 in alchemy a few hours ago. I brought it up to 23<br/>
&gt; making Distillate of Alacrity I. I have a long way to go before it will be<br/>
&gt; worth the expense in failures to do a Clarity X. I&#39;m just a level 44 <br/>
&gt; kitty.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do you bring the points up faster if you mix the more advanced stuff? I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; just asking because I really don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I got two shawls doing Great Divide quests. The Giants in the Great Divide <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t like me anymore. G.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From what I remember, you get a skillup faster by doing trivials closer to <br/>
your skill level, because according to the formula used, you have a better <br/>
chance to get a skill-up from a success than from a failure. Eqtraders.com <br/>
has a very nice tradeskill guide on their message board in the tradeskill <br/>
guide section. If I remember correctly, it&#39;s possible to get to 210 using <br/>
nothing but store bought components, but don&#39;t quote me on that.<br/>
