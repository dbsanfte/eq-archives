<b>Subject:</b> Re: Carapace Boots <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996641961">Once I got there I started looking for a vendor who sold the beetle <br/>
legs I would need. While in a tavern I was approached by a Dwarf who <br/>
had a pair for sale. The price was reasonable, so I just bought them.<br/>
<br/>
I got no response from the NPC by asking about boots, but I only <br/>
tried in passing since I still needed legs at that point. So, I have <br/>
the boots but never learned if I could get them from the NPC.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I did the carapace breastplate and helmet quest in Kaladim. Later <br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; read (on Alakazam) that there are carapace boots available from <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same NPC in Kaladim. I got the parts and went to Kaladim but get <br/>
no<br/>
&gt; &gt; offer to make the boots from the NPC. Are the boots deactivated? <br/>
Does<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone know this quest, and whether or not the boots can be had?<br/>
