<div id="ygrps-yiv-967965505">I enjoy my Ranger character.. I just get tired of people complaining about<br/>
what their class doesn&#39;t have.  I only posted that to say hey don&#39;t single<br/>
out classes that have perceived problems compared to others.. Rangers to<br/>
Palaies in particular.<br/>
<br/>
Hehe, I remember when wizards were complaining that Ice Comet is just not<br/>
powerful enough.  They claimed that without a more powerful spell, how could<br/>
they really be the masters of DD. =)<br/>
<br/>
And as for your fun comment.. &quot;Getting to 50 without having fun is plain<br/>
stupid.&quot; Teamwork and using the class specific skills would add to the fun,<br/>
posting everything on the internet is what sucks.<br/>
<br/>
PS..<br/>
<br/>
Was anyone online during the DE war last night.. What did you think of it<br/>
all?<br/>

Oh, come on, stop moaning.<br/>
<br/>
* Its weird that Rangers are better than Paladins in combats dont you think?<br/>
<br/>
* Bards get Track at lvl35.<br/>
<br/>
* The quest for SSoM is very simple to complete for the Ranger. <br/>
<br/>
I have some of Ranger friends and they are doing great. I also have some<br/>
Pally friends and they are also doing great. Why does everybody want to be<br/>
the mightiest person in Norrath? I certainly do not. And wow people are<br/>
posting spawns points on the Internet, thats just not good for the game.<br/>
Getting to 50 without having fun is plain stupid.<br/>
<br/>
ENJOY THE RIDE.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question is... When have the Rangers truly ever been upgrade?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;     1.  Given &quot;Dances with Fire Flies spell&quot;  -  wow that&#39;s a winner<br/>
&gt;     2.  Given Critical Hits with bows  -  that&#39;s a no brainer - even<br/>
&gt; though warriors cover all weapons<br/>
&gt;     3.  Given Slightly Higher Caps on certain combat skills - making them<br/>
&gt; at least similar, but lower, to the other combat classes<br/>
&gt;     4.  Given +4 SV against fire and cold - does this really matter,<br/>
&gt; seriously =)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s it..  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;     Sure I have track, but so do druids and bards.  Problem is, when all<br/>
&gt; the quests and locations for MOBs are published on the internet, who needs<br/>
&gt; that skill anymore.  I remember Brad saying that he wanted to make Rangers<br/>
&gt; the masters of duel wield... well how bout increasing our percentages for<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Oh well...   =) Lance<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	 <br/>
&gt; 	After the recent upgrade to the Ranger, Paladins were certain that<br/>
&gt; they were<br/>
&gt; 	next for enhancement. We waited patiently for the patch that was<br/>
&gt; supposed to<br/>
&gt; 	be our salvation. Instead, what we received was armor quests that<br/>
&gt; were 10<br/>
&gt; 	times the length and 5 times more costly than any of the quest of<br/>
&gt; any other<br/>
&gt; 	class. And for all of that the armor stinks. Class specific plate<br/>
&gt; armor for<br/>
&gt; 	the Paladin has less AC than that of the chain worn by the ranger.<br/>
&gt; Paladins<br/>
&gt; 	are the &quot;Holy Knight&quot; counterpart to the ranger. Yet, with the last<br/>
&gt; 3<br/>
&gt; 	patches, the Ranger has been augmented so that he has more AC even<br/>
&gt; though he<br/>
&gt; 	can wear no platemail. He also has higher skill caps, does nearly<br/>
&gt; twice the<br/>
&gt; 	damage in battle, has spell equivalents to most of the Paladins<br/>
&gt; spells yet<br/>
&gt; 	not confined to undead. Ensnare is far more effective that root.<br/>
&gt; Several<br/>
&gt; 	other spells and buffs of the druid class aren&#39;t nerfed , level<br/>
&gt; wise, as with<br/>
&gt; 	the paladin. The ranger can track. Whereas the paladin can point<br/>
&gt; himself in<br/>
&gt; 	the direction of the nearest undead, unless of course if there is a<br/>
&gt; pet in<br/>
&gt; 	the area. Now to the arguements.<br/>
&gt; 	 <br/>
