<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034967775">First to become a shaman you want to decide ONE thing. You want to be evil <br/>
or good? IMO if you would be evil (but I don&#39;t recomend it, unless your used <br/>
to playing evil races) I would suggest a troll. I don&#39;t know if you would <br/>
really care but they have faster HP regeneration. I have not played a troll <br/>
but I think the ogres home city is not so great. They&#39;res not much stuff to <br/>
fight and it would take longer to level. If youre good, then be a barbarian. <br/>
They have one of the BEST home cities I have ever been to. I was able to get <br/>
to level 11 in two days. And they have great things for even higher levels.<br/>

&gt;I am planning on making a shaman and I was wondering which you all think is <br/>
&gt;the best. I want a race that will be the strongest at higher levels, not <br/>
&gt;necessarily right away. Also if you could provide reasons it would help me <br/>
&gt;even more. Thanks for your time.<br/>
