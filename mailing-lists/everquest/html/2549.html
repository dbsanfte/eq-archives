<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-790562218"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It did last time I was there, rumor is they&#39;ve made<br/>
&gt; improvements, but I still have yet to find any reason<br/>
&gt; to bother. Nothing I really want from Luclin is that<br/>
&gt; difficult to buy in EC...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps the upcoming EQ expansion &quot;Planes of Power&quot;<br/>
&gt; comes with a 2ghz athlon and 500mb of RAM so that<br/>
&gt; everyone will have the &quot;power&quot; to actually run Luclin<br/>
&gt; smoothly... *snicker*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A measley 500mb of RAM? Bah! My 1.4G athlon can handle 2G of RAM (which is<br/>
what I have). It allows me to load 30 models. I only load a few though bc<br/>
I&#39;m too impatient for it to load all the armor models and equipment when<br/>
logging in. My computer is a powerhouse in those terms but my net connection<br/>
just sucks rocks. I will have to find out what to do about my phone company.<br/>
