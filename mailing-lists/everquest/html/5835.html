<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-672455220">I agree - even at lower levels the missions are tough.<br/>
<br/>
My level 12 enchanter was recently sent to Unrest to kill 10 <br/>
Tormented Dead.   This would normally not be too big a deal, as they <br/>
con mostly DB to me. the problem is the Death Beetles that wander <br/>
around the outside that all aggro on you when you attack one of the <br/>
dead.   I died once, and had to train three times to zone - and this <br/>
was a &quot;medium mission&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The one before was incredibly easy - I had to run to the center of a <br/>
goblin camp, I had to run to pok, then I had to speak to someone in <br/>
field of bone.  All easy actions for a level 12 enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
Now I do have to somewhat defend the system.  I believe these quests <br/>
may be soloable, but they require intense skill.  I am not very <br/>
skilled with my enchanter yet, which may be why I&#39;m having a <br/>
problem. (I am not implying anything about anyone elses play skill - <br/>
this is just my observation on my characters)<br/>
<br/>
I also recieved a mission for my level 51 shaman to go to lower guk <br/>
and kill 10 Dar Ghoul Knights.  I had never been to Lower Guk, and I <br/>
honestly enjoyed it down there - I made nearly 100 pp from killing <br/>
the greenies and picked up some items that I have sold in the bazaar <br/>
for an extra 250 pp.  I am very skilled with my shaman, as he is the <br/>
third one I have ever had.  So the mission doesn&#39;t seem as bad <br/>
(though still very hard).  <br/>
<br/>
I have sent feedback, there are some things I want them to implement:<br/>
<br/>
** Titles for people who complete a large number of missions<br/>
** Adventure points of some sort would be nice - get rewards other <br/>
than just plat (I would like a trophey).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind them being hard - I just want to have something more <br/>
tangible to prove I did it, besides some xp and money (though maybe <br/>
I been playing to much fable).<br/>

&gt; I tried to get some tasks with my 65 cleric but all of the &quot;short&quot; <br/>
tasks started in sebilis. I don&#39;t like working my way to sebilis. <br/>
And I know I can&#39;t solo the mobs there. I think we should feedback <br/>
and request they have some tasks that actually ARE soloable.<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve now got a couple of my characters working on tasks. My 49 <br/>
ranger was<br/>
&gt; &gt;advised by the task masters to go to Rathe Mountains for a task. <br/>
I did, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;everything was pointing me to Lower Guk. I&#39;ve never really been <br/>
through<br/>
&gt; &gt;Upper and Lower Guk, and going that far underground with a ranger <br/>
just makes<br/>
&gt; &gt;me concerned.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I abandoned the task. The next thing I tried was getting a task <br/>
from a task<br/>
&gt; &gt;master in Overthere. It sent me into Burning Woods, where one of <br/>
the things<br/>
&gt; &gt;I had to do was enter the giant fort and scout it out. To <br/>
accomplish that, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;discovered I had to run into the middle of the fort. I was <br/>
invisible, but as<br/>
&gt; &gt;soon as I got within agrro range, I started wailed on by a giant.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thankfully, a group was pulling giants from the fort, so it was <br/>
somewhat<br/>
&gt; &gt;abandoned. I trained a giant or two out and ran for the zone <br/>
line. The next<br/>
&gt; &gt;step is to kill 10 skeletons (can&#39;t remember exactly what type, <br/>
but I know<br/>
&gt; &gt;they con dark blue -- not sure how well bow-kiting will work in <br/>
such a busy<br/>
&gt; &gt;zone).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Frustrated with such difficult and dangerous tasks for my 49 <br/>
ranger, I tried<br/>
&gt; &gt;a task with 10 cleric. I was sent into Innothule Swamp from a PoK <br/>
task<br/>
&gt; &gt;master and told to kill 10 bull alligators (most con white, some <br/>
a healthy<br/>
&gt; &gt;dark blue). I had to run for my life and died about 10 feet from <br/>
the PoK<br/>
&gt; &gt;book. I didn&#39;t realize bull alligators helped each other out. I <br/>
got trounced<br/>
&gt; &gt;by two of them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m becoming increasingly convinced that tasks are not soloable. :<br/>
