&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Sorry about the late reply. My internet has been<br/>
&gt; down and I finally was <br/>
&gt; able to get to it. (holidays and all, thank god they<br/>
&gt; are almost over!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	You are correct there. I have a friend that has<br/>
&gt; joined because of me <br/>
&gt; and we did a little PL&#39;ing of him. However I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; go full bore but <br/>
&gt; more like &quot;helped&quot; him in some areas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	As of late I haven&#39;t had to much trouble finding<br/>
&gt; groups between 20 and <br/>
&gt; 40. But this may be a server thing. (I wonder if<br/>
&gt; there are more of a <br/>
&gt; certain level on some servers than others?) I do run<br/>
&gt; into times when I <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t find a darn thing and it sucks but then I just<br/>
&gt; go work on <br/>
&gt; tradeskills (Like alcohol tolerance!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I still say you had to have &quot;some&quot; armor on! LOL<br/>
&gt; j/k and yes Druids do <br/>
&gt; rock. I have one I&#39;m working on myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Holidays!<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; some people do get into eq through a friend and<br/>
&gt; thay do power lvl <br/>
&gt; &gt; them. I seen a 65 cleric with epic who couldnt<br/>
&gt; cast before oom. most <br/>
&gt; &gt; the time however power lvling is done by<br/>
&gt; experanced players. I have a <br/>
&gt; &gt; friend who plays to about lvl 30 before deleting<br/>
&gt; and starting <br/>
&gt; &gt; another, he enjoys going from lvl 1 to lvl 30 in a<br/>
&gt; day.  It took all <br/>
&gt; &gt; i  could do to make him play one to 65.  Dont get<br/>
&gt; ripped on power <br/>
&gt; &gt; lvling.  When you have a lvl 70 with everything<br/>
&gt; under the sun, I <br/>
&gt; &gt; doubt you will want to sit lfg for 9 hours with a<br/>
&gt; lvl 25 necro. Iam <br/>
&gt; &gt; know lvl 51 and still see very few groups as the<br/>
&gt; servers have fewer <br/>
&gt; &gt; people on.  As far as doing it naked its all about<br/>
&gt; where you go and <br/>
&gt; &gt; skill in doing it, have done it a few times and i<br/>
&gt; know how. I think <br/>
&gt; &gt; you may enjoy a druid so you will have the power<br/>
&gt; to group power lvl <br/>
&gt; &gt; and solo.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
