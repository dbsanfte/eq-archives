<div><font face="Arial" size="2">This is actualyl the BOT key quest which takes 
place in Plane of Storms.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As you&#39;ve noticed the quest is in two parts.&nbsp; 
If you&#39;ve already turned in the beard, bone, and sash, you have to follow the 
prompts and Askr gives you another bag.&nbsp; Then you need to put the two 
medallions (fromd ifferent camps) in the bag and hit combine.&nbsp; then hand 
the bag back to Askr.&nbsp; That will get you the character flag and gain you 
access to Bastion of Thunder.&nbsp; If you just tried handing the medallions 
back to him without the bag it wont work.&nbsp; My guess is that you&#39;re going to 
need to camp the named giants again and get two more medallions, get another bag 
from Askr and try to finish the 2nd part again.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Howdy All:<br>REALLY GLAD to see a new group---the only 
  reason I joined the old <br>group was to find people who were experienced in 
  EQ and could help out <br>in a crisis--not to see all that spam mail.&nbsp; 
  <br>I&#39;m having a crisis now.&nbsp; My friend did the POStorms key (beard, bone 
  <br>sash, 2 medallions) however, it looks like he never got credit for 
  <br>doing the turn in and the seer gives him a message that the 2 
  <br>medallions have not been turned in.&nbsp; Is it possible that the 
  <br>medallions he gave to Askr the Lost came from the same camp and that 
  <br>is why he has not been given credit ??? We have tried to &quot;rehail&quot; askr 
  <br>but he just gives a message to move along. <br><br><br>Thanks All <br>Tart 
  <br>Wraith of Discord <br>Maelin Starpyre Rules!!! lol&nbsp;
