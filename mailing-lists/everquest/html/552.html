<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200195554">I agree fullly with the noted comments below.  This game system may still<br/>
have bugs in it, but it an excellent system that allows many thousands hours<br/>
of enjoyment each day and each week.  My hat goes off to Varent and all the<br/>
people that have worked so hard to make this game playable and enjoyable by<br/>
the masses.<br/>
<br/>
I, also, agree that information flow and customer support should be better,<br/>
but the EQ community grew much faster than they expected and it will take<br/>
time to get better information flow and customer support in place.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the people that have helped make this game such an enjoyable<br/>
game for all us other.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My turn to rant (and I know this is going to piss some people off, but I<br/>
&gt; gotta say it)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  &quot;[Verant] could have programmed the game with more logging&quot;???(see<br/>
&gt; below)  Please.  I&#39;m going to have to come to Verants defense now.  Any<br/>
&gt; idea how much more lag there would be if there was more logging with 50<br/>
&gt; - 100 in a zone?  Verant used a nice median between logs so as to not<br/>
&gt; bog the game down more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  Everyone is complaining that there character traits and skills are<br/>
&gt; unfair.  Boo hoo.  REAL LIFE is not fair.  And Verant is trying to make<br/>
&gt; the game as real as possible. (Muffin anyone?) If your Race or Class is<br/>
&gt; that bad that you feel you need to complain everyday then change.  Hey!<br/>
&gt; No one&#39;s complaining about being a ranger or paladin, so lets all be<br/>
&gt; rangers and paladins.  Even the damn wizards who are kill stealers are<br/>
&gt; complaining for some reason that their class is unfair (Note today&#39;s<br/>
&gt; EQ&#39;Lizer).  Playing a unfair character or hard character is sweet,<br/>
&gt; because when you succeed, you prove your own abilities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  Boo hoo.  Make Poison and Apply Poison doesn&#39;t work yet and I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; sneak up behind a creature undetected and backstab for 100 points<br/>
&gt; everytime.  Wow, rogues really have it rough.  They&#39;ve only said a<br/>
&gt; million times that they are working on these problems, so chill out and<br/>
&gt; enjoy what your rogue can do.  And if he (she) still can&#39;t do anything,<br/>
&gt; then that probably reflects your intelligence more that your character&#39;s<br/>
&gt; abilities.  (And as a side note, I did like the Rogue Protest on Solusek<br/>
&gt; Ro.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. My human warrior sucks at level 20.  Wow Einstein.  Did you ever<br/>
&gt; wonder why the first 15 levels were so easy?  This class was designed<br/>
&gt; for Buffoons with attention deficit syndrome.  You were supposed to be<br/>
&gt; bored of this guy after 5 levels.  Try playing a hard character.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re the ones that pay off in the end.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5. Where are the new zones and other planes?  The game was not designed<br/>
&gt; for people playing 24-7.  The creators themselves said this.  Try<br/>
&gt; getting some sunlight.  They&#39;ll come soon enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In general to all the people complaining, do you have any idea how much<br/>
&gt; code has gone into this game?  I find that the few bugs that do exist<br/>
&gt; with over 20,000 people playing at any given time is quite remarkable.<br/>
&gt; And Verant continues to improve the game!  If anyone knows of a better<br/>
&gt; overall game, then why are you playing Everquest?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am not saying Verant is perfect, but my only issue with Verant is I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like a better status of what they are working on and their proposed<br/>
&gt; deadlines.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kudos to Verant.  I&#39;ve wasted my summer away so far on Everquest, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m loving every minute!<br/>

&gt; &gt; See, that&#39;s really the problem.  Verant &quot;Doesn&#39;t know&quot; if you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; lying or<br/>
&gt; &gt; at least that&#39;s what they claim.  I really want to know why there is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; message every few minutes on my screen telling me that my character is<br/>
&gt; &gt; saved<br/>
&gt; &gt; if they refuse to use that info to help players who have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; destroyed by<br/>
&gt; &gt; bugs that should have been squashed in beta.  I&#39;ve been lucky and have<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; lost items due to bugs, it&#39;s happened to a good friend of mine, he<br/>
&gt; &gt; just gave<br/>
&gt; &gt; up that character, didn&#39;t want to deal with that crap.  Verant doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; seem<br/>
&gt; &gt; to understand that we pay money to play this game and we shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;just deal&quot; with these kind of programming mistakes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They could have programmed the game with more logging to know what<br/>
&gt; &gt; happened<br/>
&gt; &gt; when a character dies and know what they had when they died so they<br/>
&gt; &gt; could be<br/>
&gt; &gt; restored without worry that you really traded your items to a friend<br/>
&gt; &gt; before<br/>
&gt; &gt; dieing on the boat but they made the decision not to, apparently, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; to not<br/>
&gt; &gt; use that data and instead they just have their GM&#39;s give the same line<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; garbage every time that they can&#39;t do anything.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One of the biggest problems with this game right now is their severe<br/>
&gt; &gt; lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; customer service and their lack of being responsible for the bugs in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game.  BAH<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not to be rough about it, but frankly you&#39;re shit out of luck.  I&#39;m on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; reimbursement list too - have been for over a month now.  Just go out<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunt little newbie-ish things to get enough cash for food, and work<br/>
&gt; &gt; your way<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to where you were.  Or if you&#39;re lucky like me, friends will help<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; to recoup your loss (Thanks again Natalia, Arith, Lanor).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant has no way of knowing if you&#39;re lying or not...and frankly, if<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; manage to bug them into giving it to you - let me know...I think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; lost a<br/>
&gt; &gt; shiny metallic robe too....<br/>
