Yesterday (11/25/04) Kuyena and I werre over in Butcherblock trying to<br/>
find her a Basalisk tounge to help finish her armor quest. Anyway<br/>
after I poped in through the book there was a Barbarian Shaman<br/>
standing there. Her name was Shaman Traxa and she was asking for<br/>
certain items. At first I couldn&#39;t tell if she was a real player who<br/>
had bad faction and couldn&#39;t go get the stuff because the guards would<br/>
KOS her or if she was a new NPC, when doing a /who she would not show<br/>
up. There was a froggy there by the name of Rattlehead who was trying<br/>
to find the stuff so I asked her if this was a quest or a real person.<br/>
Rattlehead didn&#39;t know herself so I began to ask Shaman Traxa some<br/>
questions to try and find out. <br/>
<br/>
Shaman Traxa would do things that really threw me off, she acted like<br/>
a NPC but then acted like a player. I would ask her if she was a real<br/>
player or a NPC and she replied with &quot;What is a NPC?&quot; and then I<br/>
apologiezed for being rude (if she was a real person) and explained<br/>
why I was asking all the questions and told her I am confused about<br/>
her and she replied &quot;What confused?&quot; I wish I would have turned my<br/>
/log on to have gotten the full text but as you can see by her actions<br/>
(sitting and casting SoW on another toon) and her text it was as if<br/>
she was a RL player but not quite. Anyway after recieving all the<br/>
items she would turn into a red Dragon and then attack you. Oh and<br/>
during this time  there would be little things like in emote text it<br/>
would say &quot;Shaman Traxa opens a book and begins to read from it.&quot;<br/>
followed by yellow text &quot;Sparks flash across the sky&quot;. And when she<br/>
turned into a dragon there was in yellow text a<br/>
&quot;SCHREEEEEAAAAACCCCHHHHHHH!&quot;. Anyway there was another person there<br/>
named Cometome who was a much higher level toon buffing and healing us<br/>
while we were fighting Shaman Traxa. He told me that only lowbies can<br/>
kill it when I said I was going to go get Durgaa. Upon killing Shaman<br/>
Traxa the loot was all the items we had gathered per her request plus<br/>
a Fire Emerald. Oh and after she killed Rattlehead she summoned her<br/>
back and Rattlehead was in her exact image.<br/>
<br/>
So my thoughts on this was it was either a GM event, (I know I already<br/>
got into a debate with someone about what &quot;uber level&quot; GM events<br/>
usually are), A new quest in Butcher Block, A test of something new by<br/>
Sony such as using AI (Artificial Intelligence), or a real player<br/>
doing all this. I&#39;ve heard rumors that you can now go to other servers<br/>
with your toons but I haven&#39;t tried it yet. If so can a PVP go to a<br/>
non-PVP server? Maybe this was the case and some guys wanted to have<br/>
some fun? But why did Shaman Traxa not appear on /who then? So many<br/>
questions - so little answers. If anyone has seen anything on this or<br/>
knows anything about it please let me know! I can&#39;t sleep at night<br/>
anymore!  LOL<br/>
