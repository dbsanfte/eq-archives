<div id="ygrps-yiv-804776744">Hi all, I&#39;m new to the group and new to EQ.  I&#39;ve been playing maybe<br/>
three days.<br/>
<br/>
I am now a level 9 barbarian warrior.  So far I&#39;ve been putting all my<br/>
points into 1h slashing.  I have six points that I have no clue where<br/>
to put.  Any suggestions?  Bash, taunt? Dodge? I&#39;m leaning towards<br/>
those, but I want to focus my efforts so that I get the most results<br/>
from my points so I can really use some advice.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, for some strange reason i&#39;ve been developing blacksmithing.  I&#39;ve<br/>
got near 30 points in that.  It&#39;s fun, but seriously...will anything<br/>
fruitful ever come of this trade skill?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</div>
