<br>we tried to sign back on. &nbsp;Computer #1 is P2-350 256 meg ram, Windows ME, 40 
<br>gig HD, 8x burner. &nbsp;Computer #2 is Celeron 533, 192 meg ram, 10 gig HD, 
<br>Windows ME. &nbsp;Both are on cable modem using ICS. &nbsp;We finally gave up because 
<br>of the lag and linkdead problems and then trying to get signed back into 
<br>game. &nbsp;

<br>Is it just me, or is it taking longer and longer to connect? &nbsp;I couldn&#39;t
<br>even get past the login screen for 5 or 10 minutes. &nbsp;Kept saying that it
<br>couldn&#39;t connect to login server. &nbsp;Never had that happen unless it was down
<br>for a patch (which it wasn&#39;t). &nbsp;Also noticed that the times when I choose
<br>my server, and going to the character screen, and the time from the
<br>character screen to the game are much longer.
<br>
<br>I&#39;m running a Celeron 533 w/ 185 MB ram, windows ME a cable modem, and
<br>about 2GB of drive space for windows to write to. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</blockquote>
