<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-656844435">I was wondering if there was any real difference to the rations/food you can <br/>
buy or obtain, (like one lasts longer or gives a specific benefit) other <br/>
than weight, cost and perhaps personal preferance (IE - you prefer to carry <br/>
fish instead of bread)? The reason I&#39;m asking, is that I noticed that fish <br/>
(which can be gotten by fishing, which costs practically nothing - just the <br/>
cost of a fishing rod and bait) seem to last longer than loaves of bread <br/>
(cost around 2 SP each). I was wondering if this were true, or just my <br/>
perception of it. If this is true however, I wonder if the same were true <br/>
for drink (IE - mead or ale would last longer than water)?<br/>
