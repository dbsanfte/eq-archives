Ok, so you want to make your own armor as quickly and cost effective as<br/>
possible? Well look no further, for I shall show you the way. Below is a<br/>
break-down of the phases of smithing.<br/>
Beginning Smithing (SKILL 1-27)<br/>
There are two ways to start smithing. One is to start from ground zero and<br/>
gain all your skill naturally. This is certainly possible and you can do it<br/>
by sharpening rusty daggers (place a sharpening stone and a rusty dagger in<br/>
the forge and click combine) and rusty shortswords until you hit 20 or so<br/>
but I suggest against it. Not only is it extremely tedious but its also<br/>
pretty wasteful of money and time. Finding that many daggers can be<br/>
annoying. Instead I suggest gaining a few levels (4) and dumping 20 points<br/>
in to Blacksmithing before you even sharpen your first weapon. 20 is the<br/>
limit that NPC trainers will train you to, so after that, you have to earn<br/>
it the hard way. Once you hit skill 21, you will no longer gain any skill<br/>
from sharpening cheap-o weapons. Instead you must get rusty weapons that you<br/>
can sell for more than 1gp and sharpen them only (longswords, spears, battle<br/>
axes, etc) NOTE: You cannot sharpen hammers, staves or anything else without<br/>
any &quot;sharp tips&quot; (maces are ok though) Keep sharpening these expensive rusty<br/>
weapons until you hit approximate 27 skill. At that point these should stop<br/>
giving you skill increases and its time to REALLY spend some money.<br/>
<br/>
Apprentice Smithing (SKILL 27-50)<br/>
This is massive boredom here. During this time period you will be making<br/>
skewers. Skewers require one metal bit, one flask of water, and one skewer<br/>
mold. NOTE: DO NOT USE SUMMONED WATER. Cost per skewer attempt is roughly<br/>
2-3g each, so you can see if you are spending 40 plats the number of<br/>
repetitions you will go through. To make the metal bits you need to put two<br/>
small pieces of ore and one flask of water in the forge and combine. Don&#39;t<br/>
be discouraged if you rarely succeed. I think I made maybe 10 or 11 skewers<br/>
during my whole journey to 40 smithing, if even that many, needless to say<br/>
you still gain skill. Just keep pouring in your money and improving your<br/>
skill.<br/>
<br/>
Journeyman Smithing (SKILL 50-80)<br/>
Congratulations! At skill 50 you can now make some easy banded mail items.<br/>
Start by making Banded GORGETS. These take one gorget mold, one metal sheet,<br/>
and one flask of water. Rough cost per attempt is about 1.2 platinum. These<br/>
banded gorgets can be sold to other players and thus your smithing training<br/>
should start to pay for itself. At 55, you can start making BRACERS and<br/>
BOOTS. See the chart below for approximate skill needed to be successful at<br/>
making banded items. This is not to say its impossible to make these items<br/>
at lower skill levels, indeed you can make a helm with only 21 skill but<br/>
your chances are slim to say the least. My recommended skill levels produce<br/>
success around 20-30% of the time. This is sufficient for the items to pay<br/>
for themselves and provide extra money for increased learning.<br/>
<br/>
Master Smithing (SKILL 80+)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Start raking in the cash. As you get higher and higher you will notice<br/>
certain banded items no longer give you skill, eventually resulting in the<br/>
need to make mostly tunics, leggings, and cloaks.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was wondering if someone would be so kind as to post/repost a complete<br/>
&gt; listing of items you can create/make with blacksmithing, the approximate<br/>
&gt; level they become trivial, the minimum skill level you&#39;d recommend before<br/>
&gt; trying to create/make them, and the approximate resale value to other<br/>
&gt; players. I know this was posted once before, but don&#39;t know what happened<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; my copy - (I guess that&#39;s what I get for using a free email service).<br/>
Thanks<br/>
&gt; in advance!<br/>
