<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910026190">Hi Shadow_4unme,<br/>
<br/>
	Sorry about the late reply. My internet has been down and I finally was <br/>
able to get to it. (holidays and all, thank god they are almost over!)<br/>
<br/>
	You are correct there. I have a friend that has joined because of me <br/>
and we did a little PL&#39;ing of him. However I didn&#39;t go full bore but <br/>
more like &quot;helped&quot; him in some areas.<br/>
<br/>
	As of late I haven&#39;t had to much trouble finding groups between 20 and <br/>
40. But this may be a server thing. (I wonder if there are more of a <br/>
certain level on some servers than others?) I do run into times when I <br/>
can&#39;t find a darn thing and it sucks but then I just go work on <br/>
tradeskills (Like alcohol tolerance!)<br/>
<br/>
	I still say you had to have &quot;some&quot; armor on! LOL j/k and yes Druids do <br/>
rock. I have one I&#39;m working on myself.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays!<br/>

&gt; some people do get into eq through a friend and thay do power lvl <br/>
&gt; them. I seen a 65 cleric with epic who couldnt cast before oom. most <br/>
&gt; the time however power lvling is done by experanced players. I have a <br/>
&gt; friend who plays to about lvl 30 before deleting and starting <br/>
&gt; another, he enjoys going from lvl 1 to lvl 30 in a day.  It took all <br/>
&gt; i  could do to make him play one to 65.  Dont get ripped on power <br/>
&gt; lvling.  When you have a lvl 70 with everything under the sun, I <br/>
&gt; doubt you will want to sit lfg for 9 hours with a lvl 25 necro. Iam <br/>
&gt; know lvl 51 and still see very few groups as the servers have fewer <br/>
&gt; people on.  As far as doing it naked its all about where you go and <br/>
&gt; skill in doing it, have done it a few times and i know how. I think <br/>
&gt; you may enjoy a druid so you will have the power to group power lvl <br/>
&gt; and solo.<br/>
