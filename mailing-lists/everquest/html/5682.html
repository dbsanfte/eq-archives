&gt; Hey,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I am having a lot of trouble completing a<br/>
&gt; druid/cleric quest that starts in Felwithe.  It is for<br/>
&gt; the Initiate of Tunare neckpiece, that will eventually<br/>
&gt; lead me to getting a neck piece that has a mana free<br/>
&gt; root effect.  I am having problems getting the<br/>
&gt; Rancerous Ghouls to spawn in Lesser Faydark.  I have<br/>
&gt; done all day (real time) camps running around killing<br/>
&gt; undead, and tracking, but can&#39;t seem to get them to<br/>
&gt; spawn.  Any ideas?<br/>

I&#39;m not sure that they spawn anymore... I think they were only there<br/>
fore a couple of weeks for a special &#39;event&#39; a couple of years ago, and<br/>
the quest involving them dates to that event too.<br/>
<br/>
I may be wrong, but I don&#39;t think that quest works anymore.<br/>
