<div id="ygrps-yiv-174102445">I am a level 6 halfling warrior, first character. I am currently <br/>
hunting just outside the gate of Misty Thicket. I can handle about <br/>
30% of what I meet, and with care I have not been killed lately.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot find my heading very well, so I am cautious going out too <br/>
far. At the gates are deputies to take care of the big stuff, so I <br/>
hunt nearby. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if there is a zone at the other side of Misty <br/>
Thicket?<br/>
<br/>
How nasty do things get out there? I don&#39;t expect to take on giant <br/>
spiders too soon, but I don&#39;t want to play too timid, either.<br/>
<br/>
Any advise?<br/>
<br/>
I can group with other newbies for short runs, but I don&#39;t have the <br/>
time to get a regular group together right now. Can these short term <br/>
groups be very useful, or is it better to concentrate on solo stat <br/>
building?<br/>
