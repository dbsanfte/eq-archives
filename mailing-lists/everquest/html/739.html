<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-931142856">My question is... When have the Rangers truly ever been upgrade?<br/>
�<br/>
��� 1.� Given &quot;Dances with Fire Flies spell&quot;� -� wow that&#39;s a winner<br/>
��� 2.� Given Critical Hits with bows� -� that&#39;s a no brainer - even though<br/>
warriors cover all weapons<br/>
��� 3.� Given Slightly Higher Caps on certain combat skills -�making them at<br/>
least similar, but lower, to the other combat classes<br/>
��� 4.��Given +4 SV against fire and cold - does this really matter,<br/>
seriously =)<br/>
�<br/>
That&#39;s it..� <br/>
�<br/>
��� Sure I have track, but so do druids and bards.� Problem is, when all the<br/>
quests and locations for MOBs are published on the internet, who needs that<br/>
skill anymore.� I remember Brad saying that he wanted to make Rangers the<br/>
masters of duel wield... well how bout increasing our percentages for it.<br/>
�<br/>
Oh well...�� =) Lance<br/>

After the recent upgrade to the Ranger, Paladins were certain that they were<br/>
next for enhancement. We waited patiently for the patch that was supposed to<br/>
be our salvation. Instead, what we received was armor quests that were 10<br/>
times the length and 5 times more costly than any of the quest of any other<br/>
class. And for all of that the armor stinks. Class specific plate armor for<br/>
the Paladin has less AC than that of the chain worn by the ranger. Paladins<br/>
are the &quot;Holy Knight&quot; counterpart to the ranger. Yet, with the last 3<br/>
patches, the Ranger has been augmented so that he has more AC even though he<br/>
can wear no platemail. He also has higher skill caps, does nearly twice the<br/>
damage in battle, has spell equivalents to most of the Paladins spells yet<br/>
not confined to undead. Ensnare is far more effective that root. Several<br/>
other spells and buffs of the druid class aren&#39;t nerfed , level wise, as<br/>
with<br/>
the paladin. The ranger can track. Whereas the paladin can point himself in<br/>
the direction of the nearest undead, unless of course if there is a pet in<br/>
the area. Now to the arguements.<br/>
