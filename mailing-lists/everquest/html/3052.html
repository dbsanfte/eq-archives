&gt; Yeah the three classes that are &quot;tanks&quot; are Warriors, Paladins<br/>
&gt; and Shadowknights.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess it depends on if you want to play an important role in epic<br/>
&gt; encounters or be able to solo well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The classes that seem to be really important in epic encounters are<br/>
&gt;  the warrior(defensive), cleric(complete heal), enchanter(haste and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>clarity),<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rogue(melee damage), wizard(magic damage) and bard(resistance buffs).<br/>
&gt; The other classes are better if you want to play mostly by yourself,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the kinda thing that gives people the wrong impression about<br/>
classes.  Shaman are extremely important to a raid, from slowing a mob to<br/>
giving melee some excellent stat buffs.  High level Rangers put out obscene<br/>
amounts of damage and are able to tank mobs that aggro on casters, while<br/>
being about to almost immedialely reduce aggro when needed.  Mages are<br/>
excellent for mana regen (mod rods) and CotH.  Druids are excellent<br/>
secondary healers on raid, throwing in heals between CHs.  Monks and SK&#39;s<br/>
are excellent indoor pullers (breaking Fear is terribly hard without a Monk<br/>
or SK to scout).<br/>
<br/>
There really isn&#39;t one single class that is not needed in a raid situation.</div>
