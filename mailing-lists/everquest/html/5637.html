<div id="ygrps-yiv-888954980">I&#39;ve got XP Pro with a 1.7 Celeron, 768 Ram and an ATI<br/>
9000 vid card (just 64 megs). Not the best set up, but<br/>
it works well for me. I know if I had a better vid<br/>
card, my lag would be even less, but I just don&#39;t have<br/>
the funds now, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I used to run Win ME and I lagged much worse then. So<br/>
yeah, it could be the OS.<br/>

&gt; 1.8Ghz with 1GB of RAM and a 128MB video card.  I<br/>
&gt; very rarely lag.  Sometimes int he Bazaar when its<br/>
&gt; crowded, and sometimes in POK when people are Mass<br/>
&gt; Group Buffing.  Other than that, it&#39;s quite smooth. <br/>
&gt; And this is with Spell Particles turned on with full<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering if the person might be running Windows<br/>
&gt; ME because I do know that I had a lot more lag when<br/>
&gt; I ran EQ under WinME, but when I upgraded to Windows<br/>
&gt; XP it seemed to work miracles for reducing lag. <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s about the only thing I could see that may<br/>
&gt; make a difference.  I also have a 2nd PC which is<br/>
&gt; relatively the same specs, except its a 1.6Ghz. <br/>
&gt; Same thing still applies though.  Very little lag.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe that&#39;s the difference?  The OS you use?<br/>

&gt;   I&#39;ve not been playing for a while now, but this<br/>
&gt; has made me curious.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I upgraded to DX9 last summer so I could play SWG.<br/>
&gt; Then I started playing EQ again last fall, still<br/>
&gt; using DX9. I didn&#39;t notice any difference, just my<br/>
&gt; usual lag in PoK and the bazaar. So, is it the DX9<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s messing everyone up, or some &quot;upgrade&quot; that<br/>
&gt; SOE did to the graphic engine?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
