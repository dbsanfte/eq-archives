<div id="ygrps-yiv-813716673">LOL well I can agree with the &quot;rich&quot; part for sure! 10k plat for one of <br/>
them isn&#39;t cheap!<br/>
<br/>
I have one for my cleric as well and I found that (other than medding <br/>
and looking rich) they help when you are in an area with a lot of hills <br/>
(You don&#39;t get injured from falling) and if you are encumbered it helps. <br/>
They are fun to ride on but slow to start and slow to stop. It&#39;s like <br/>
its emulating you spuring it&#39;s side and saying &quot;Giddyup!&quot;. Oh and they <br/>
eat like mad! So either become good a baking or buy cheap food (Or <br/>
better yet summon if you can) and keep it in an unbagged slot so it will <br/>
be the first food to get eaten.<br/>
<br/>
As for the old debate of which is better, a Drog or a Horse, all I will <br/>
say is just keep this in mind, on a horse you constantly have his/her <br/>
head in your view and can make targeting a little difficult if you are <br/>
just manually clicking on your target. With a Drog you don&#39;t have the <br/>
head in your view, unless you are surrounded by a bunch of gnomes!<br/>

Subject: Are slow horses worth getting?<br/>
<br/>
They look fun to ride on, but i don&#39;t think they are worth it because <br/>
on my friend&#39;s account he has a cheap drog and then i found out the <br/>
cheap ones are slow =P lol. Are the horses the same? All the things <br/>
the cheap ones do is make you look rich.</div>
