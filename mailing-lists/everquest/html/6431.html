<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382294021">I&#39;m running Win2k Pro on:<br/>
<br/>
AthlonXP 3000+<br/>
512 mb PC2100 ram<br/>
Geforce FX5200 (128 mb)<br/>
80 gb ATA133 hd<br/>
Custom pagefile - min is 1.5 gb, max is 3 gb<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got all models except Erudites and Ogres on, music and spell effects<br/>
off as a matter of preference...everything else except gamma is set to the<br/>
max.<br/>
<br/>
No lag. Runs like a dream.<br/>
<br/>
My connection is 1.5 down/384 up DSL through Alltel, using the provided<br/>
modem and shared using another machine as router and firewall.<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned defragging....PerfectDisk seems to be quite nice and it<br/>
can do it while the machine is idle automatically. I highly recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
I used to run WinME on the machine and it ran like a bat out of hell, even<br/>
faster than 2k, but I was eventually forced to drop it during some<br/>
troubleshooting. Problem turned out to be bad ram but no one would actually<br/>
listen to me when I insisted ME was innocent here, and had ran quite nicely<br/>
before the ram started acting up. It took installing another OS before<br/>
anyone else thought there was *really* a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Not one word about WinME. I know what&#39;s generally thought of it. :-)<br/>

&gt; Dang Su, what&#39;s the stats on your PC? I think mine takes about 5 minutes<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; load.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s what I have...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; eMachines W3050 Wal*Mart special (Hey, it was cheap and I needed something<br/>
&gt; bad)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2Ghz AMD processor<br/>
&gt; 2GB Ram (upgraded from 512)<br/>
&gt; 80GB HD<br/>
&gt; 10GB HD (Added)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have the OS (WinXP Pro, it came with Home) loaded on the 10GB drive and<br/>
&gt; the 80 GB drive partitioned off with a 5GB partition dedicated as a swap<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; paging file.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Granted this probably helps me load faster but can be a real headache to<br/>
&gt; configure for the average computer user who doesn&#39;t want to mess with all<br/>
&gt; that. Also when was the last time you defragged? That could help some.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Since it takes me 20 minutes to load I tend to just walk away during that<br/>
&gt; part. :-)<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
