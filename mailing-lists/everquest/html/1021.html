<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916304885">According to Everlore.com, you are correct. those 2 do have the same <br/>
stats. But the icetooth claw only weighs 2.0 while the Crystalized <br/>
Sword weighs 4.0.<br/>
<br/>
Do you happen to have an Icetooth claw for sale?? :D<br/>

thinking about the wrong sword here but what I am thinking is a <br/>
