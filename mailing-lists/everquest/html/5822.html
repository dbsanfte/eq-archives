<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267386127">Hello fellow EQ addicts!  For the few who might of known me..well I am back.<br/>
For those who don&#39;t remember here is a little story on how I got into this<br/>
group.  Last year I was in the gulf for 9 months with no EQ (only thing that<br/>
kept me sane was my collection of EQ guides) and I managed to have a buddy<br/>
of mine register this email address with Yahoo Groups..so while I was at sea<br/>
I could still keep up with the latest EQ news.  When I came back mid Nov. I<br/>
was amazed at all the changes the game has been thru (before I left I just<br/>
had downloaded LoY) now I&#39;m upto date with all the expansions.  So anyway<br/>
here is a little info about me:<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing EQ now since June of 02 (a buddy of mine got me started)<br/>
and have been addicted ever since.  I spent the majority of my time making<br/>
all kinds of characters, deleting them, making more, deleting<br/>
those..etc.,just to see how each class is like.  Well I have finally managed<br/>
to stick with a class I like which is my main 53 DE SK..3 more AAs and I get<br/>
a title heh.  I play on the Ayonae Ro server (with a couple old alts on<br/>
Tunare) and I am a member of the Caelitus guild and have been for about 5<br/>
1/2 months now.  Here is a list of all my..mains.<br/>
