<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I thought this was kind of&nbsp;funny 
actually.&nbsp; I don&#39;t recall ever taking spelling after the elementary school 
levels.&nbsp; From Grades 9 - 12 they assumed that if we made it that far then 
we already knew how to spell.&nbsp; So if this person is still in that phase of 
his/her life where Spelling is a major subject of study then I could believe 
&quot;whole life&quot; could equal 10 years!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree with Jerry, though, who stated in another 
email that if you do that by habit, then you&#39;ll find yourself doing it when you 
shouldn&#39;t.&nbsp; It&#39;s best to learn proper spelling and grammar skills first and 
make them a habit.&nbsp; Then you can use your internet-ese for fun.&nbsp; Worst 
thing you could do is turn in a research paper for your professor that&#39;s full of 
abbreviations and misspellings, or perhaps be making a big presentation at work 
and have that kind of spelling and grammar.&nbsp; Nobody would take you 
seriously.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There are a few reasons why people type like that: 
1.&nbsp; Because they don&#39;t know how to type properly so they can&#39;t keep up with 
how fast the internet chat room is moving, 2.&nbsp; Because they really don&#39;t 
know how to spell or how to use proper grammar, and/or 3.&nbsp; They think it&#39;s 
cool when it&#39;s really not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which one are you?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You learned to spell for a reason.&nbsp; You say 
you&#39;re good at it.&nbsp; So use it. </font></div>

  that you could<br>spell correctly but that you were purposely misspelling 
  things for fun.<br>I had assumed you were doing it to make fun of people who 
  type like that.<br>:-)<br>If I were a mean person I&#39;d ask if your whole life 
  was 10 years. ;-D<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>&gt; oh believe me i can spell

  me<br>because I said something about<br>&gt; spelling in another message. And 
  she sent me a private message with all<br>the<br>&gt; words misspelled asking 
  me why I ask people to spell things correctly.<br>&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s 
  just a joke to make fun of people who can&#39;t spell.<br>lol.<br>&gt; :-)<br>&gt;
