<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693604453">Yeah. some newbs can be pretty dense when asking for stuff. I have ppl<br/>
asking my bard for sow. and she&#39;s lvl 12. I went anon as my cleric and some<br/>
newb started following me around asking me for clarity. I told him I&#39;m not<br/>
an enc. He asked for sow. i explained I couldn&#39;t sow. (I&#39;m a high elf for<br/>
pities sake). Then he asked for str buff. I started to say that I didn&#39;t use<br/>
reckless str bc it&#39;s negative effects were too annoying. Then my group<br/>
partner said to the newb &quot;We are on a quest. The mana is reserved for the<br/>
completion of that quest.&quot; and the guy shut up. Heh. my groupie got really<br/>
protective. when teh newb pulled mobs over to me when I was medding, my<br/>
groupie started saying &quot;Don&#39;t train my cleric! You pull trains on my cleric,<br/>
I let you die!&quot;<br/>
Sadly the guy didn&#39;t get the hint and he added us both to his friend&#39;s<br/>
list...<br/>
And I don&#39;t know how but he was looing things we killed right after we<br/>
killed them...  some kinda bug.<br/>
ack. didn&#39;t mean to sound complaining. I was actually having fun. once the<br/>
newb went away my groupie and I kicked ass and got lots of cool stuff.<br/>
btw, the ghoulbane quest is now broken.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think I have the patience to ever play a<br/>
&gt; &gt; caster -- the 30th person to ask me for SoW, would<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably get nuked.<br/>
