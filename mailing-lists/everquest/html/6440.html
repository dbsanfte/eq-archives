to be the new free mount for the new expansion. If true <br/>
it looks sweet. It is rumored to have a quest associated with it to <br/>
increase the base run speed.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone hear anything else about it? Im getting the expansion sooner or <br/>
later and want to make sure the proper toon gets him. Would be nice if <br/>
it wasnt no drop..but like all other mounts i can only assume it is.<br/>
<br/>
As always,<br/>
