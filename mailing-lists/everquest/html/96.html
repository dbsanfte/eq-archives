<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306776588">Last night I just started a Dark Elf.  <br/>
Walk on the Wild Side.<br/>
<br/>
My first real character experience requiring so much<br/>
swimming.  Anyhow, none of the NPC&#39;s, after frequent <br/>
hailings, appear to have a voice.  /Consider is very silly.<br/>
<br/>
I encoutered a few pets like a skeleton and <br/>
considered they were best to leave alone for now.<br/>
<br/>
There are some funny ghouls, one looks as if on patrol.<br/>
<br/>
West Freeport has it&#39;s bats, rats and snakes.  <br/>
What would I be looking for in the Dark City?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
