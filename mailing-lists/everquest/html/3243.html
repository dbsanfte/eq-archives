&gt; My biggest pet peeve is when people come up to me and demand I sow <br/>
them when I am in the middle of a battle.  Next time I get around to <br/>
kunark,  I will be getting the spell Scale of wolf,  it is the <br/>
upgrade to SOW,  but with a BIG drawback,  as soon as you cast <br/>
another spell,  or enter combat the spell is gone (similar to invis)  <br/>
SO,  next time some idiot demands a SOW from me, I&#39;ll gladly give <br/>
them scale of wolf =D <br/>

twice in 2 years of playing!  Once was <br/>

&gt; Death is just a part of the game.  Yeah, it sucks to die, <br/>
especially <br/>
&gt; deep in a dungone or in the middle of the zone.  Luckily I can SoW, <br/>
&gt; buff myself to the max and RUN like mad.  It helps to know where <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; are when you go down.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think all Buffs, Rezzes, SoW and all of that are bestowed upon <br/>
&gt; people as a favor, not as a requirement just because you can.  I <br/>
&gt; get &quot;Demands&quot; for Sow and anything else.  A lot of people get <br/>
ignored.<br/>
&gt; And I always make sure to have a few plat on me, for a port, a <br/>
&gt; clarity or a rez.  It&#39;s only right to at least offer.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh, I know that feeling. I get sooo many rez requests for my <br/>
&gt; cleric. I mean,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I will get people who contact me when I am in GD and want me to <br/>
rez <br/>
&gt; them in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Guk. And I&quot;m not even talking about guildies.. My guildies are <br/>
&gt; fairly nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; about that. There have been maybe 2 people in guild (not counting <br/>
&gt; the ones<br/>
&gt; &gt; related to me by blood) who annoyed me by wanting me to drop <br/>
&gt; everything to<br/>
&gt; &gt; go either rez or powerlevel them. The rezzing doesn&#39;t bother me. <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; did over<br/>
&gt; &gt; 33 rezzes in 2 days. I received donations for 2 of them. But I <br/>
felt <br/>
&gt; good<br/>
&gt; &gt; having helped people. I generally only ask for a rez if I can&#39;t <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; back to<br/>
&gt; &gt; my own corpse to rez it-- or if I&#39;m playing my bard or wizard.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In regards to death in game and such.  There was a time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; when our highest level Cleric at the time was so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; inundated with requests from  guildies to rez them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; everytime they died.  It didn&#39;t matter that  there was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cleric in the zone that was happy to do the rez, for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; small donation in most cases.  But the people that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; either had not been smart enough to carry enough pp on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them or were just too cheap to donate for the rez were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mostly the ones to beg our cleric to rezz them.  Now our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cleric soon realized the pattern only after I had the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gumption to mention it to him after I got a rezz from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him, luckily he was only one zone over from where I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; died and he was getting ready to log for the night so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; managed to catch him when he wasn&#39;t busy.  Once I showed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him the pattern he learned to not drop everything he was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doing to rezz the poor soul and also checked to see if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there was a cleric nearby before he even went to rezz<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the peep.  Unfortunately he got  one request too many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; when he was working on his Epic and he got fed up and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; left guild.  But the few of us who didn&#39;t bother him<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; constantly if he was not busy he will still do teh rez<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for  us IF and only If we were not able to find one on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our own.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But the rezzes really are  more of a priviledge than a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; right in the game. At least that is the way I see it.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pretty much solo a lot onmy own atm when i am really not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wanting to hurry up and level.  this helps me learn the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; zone I am in a little better and  I rarely ask for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rezz unless I have lost a level or I am very close to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ding.  And if I must go to the guild for a rezz i make<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sure I have exhausted all the other avenues before going<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to teh guild to see if any of our rezzers are on.  Hell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve even settled for a 35% on more occasion than I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; count  if that was the best i could get and was quite<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; happy with it. And i always make sure that I offer a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; donation whether I have said I would donate or not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Most times when I do get teh rezz I have had the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; donation rejected only because I made the effort to fork<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; over the pp.<br/>
