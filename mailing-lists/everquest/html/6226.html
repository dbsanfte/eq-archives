<div id="ygrps-yiv-798116760">There is a website that does weekly comic strips of EQ I think I believe it&#39;s pvponline.com or pvp.com.. Not sure.<br/>
Not sure if it&#39;s still there but there was a guide on how to be annoying in Everquest on somethingawful.com.<br/>
My brother actually tried some of the ideas. He aggrod a bixie and then convinced some newbs that it was his friend in shapeshifted form and got them to try to invite it to group. He was like &quot;would you group with my friend please? He&#39;s not very big but he can punch pretty hard&quot;. He also did the same with some prisoners in Highkeep. Took them to the warrior room. Nobody believed him and started killing the prisoners. My bro was like &quot;NO! He&#39;s my friend!!&quot; When they looted the corpses he was like &quot;NOOO! Now he can&#39;t get a rez and he lost his level!!&quot;<br/>
I&#39;ll have to look up more sites with EQ stuff.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt;&gt; Ahahaha! I remember that one. &quot;LEEROOOY Dragon time!&quot; I love when his <br/>
&gt;&gt; friend is like &quot;you&#39;re such an idiot&quot;.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Did you see the StarWars Galaxies one at big-boys.com?<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think it&#39;s at www.big-boys.com/achrive3 somewhere around there. My <br/>
&gt;&gt; brother was singing &quot;my backpack&#39;s got jets&quot; for a few days after seeing <br/>
&gt;&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;&gt; luv,<br/>
