<b>Subject:</b> Training:  A Technical Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175360812">Hey all.  I&#39;m a level 8 Half Elf ranger (first character) and I want <br/>
to train up some of my abilities beyond the 5 practice credits I get <br/>
when I level.  I&#39;ve noticed several skills that have what look like <br/>
prices (coins of varying colors with numbers inside them) but I have <br/>
been unable to get the trainers to teach me those skills.  When I <br/>
click practice (after putting my practice credits into another <br/>
skill), it tells me that I&#39;m out of practice credits and have to go <br/>
adventuring some more.  Is there ANY way to pay gold (or silver or <br/>
copper) for training?  If so, HOW?  What do I click and all?  It <br/>
shows my available money and I&#39;ve got the cash, but I just can&#39;t seem <br/>
to get the trainer to take the money and train me.<br/>
Thanks for any help.</div>
