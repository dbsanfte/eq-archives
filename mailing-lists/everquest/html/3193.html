<b>Subject:</b> The boat to Kunark <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363474434">The other day I decided that a trip to Kunark was in order for my <br/>
druid. I will be needing Brute hides, and so was ready to go and hunt <br/>
them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never met the boat. I <br/>
tried three times, three different shuttles, and they went out to <br/>
Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the boat left. The <br/>
shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>
<br/>
That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick off gnolls, and <br/>
forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool box full of them. <br/>
have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there until I get the <br/>
rest.<br/>
<br/>
Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls, which I have <br/>
tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br/>
<br/>
Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I want to do it the <br/>
old-fashioned way.<br/>
