 </span></blockquote>my quadding knowledge is based on a french wizzy only site, and a few<br/>
attemtps with my wizzy (she is 40 and levelled w/o kiting most of the<br/>
time). before i explain the basic idea, let me add this: quadding isn&#39;t<br/>
very welcome by other players, especially in zones with many hunting<br/>
people. IMHO this is a technique to be done in off hours (getting harder<br/>
because those times maybe main times for other players). also i have to<br/>
add, if some quadder endangers my party or me, or just annoys other<br/>
people in the zone, i nuke away her/his tail - without any friendly<br/>
warning.<br/>
<br/>
ok, the basic idea is to maximise experience per time. you need two<br/>
things for that: (1) a slow spell and (2) area damage spells. it is<br/>
good for (1) to have an area version of this as well. what i also<br/>
recommend is some knowledge of the zone you want to kite in, because<br/>
if the zone has some weird pathing, or you can get other adds, you<br/>
won&#39;t have much fun doing it. two additional things make it somewhat<br/>
easier: (a) something to make you run faster, eg sow, jboots, horse<br/>
and (b) candy of course, because many of those area damage spells<br/>
need some amounts of mana.<br/>
<br/>
because of (1), (2) and (a) it is easiest for druids because of their<br/>
normal spells. wizzies either need jboots or sow potions.<br/>
<br/>
an additional nice-to-have-thing for wizzies, is anice stick obtained<br/>
through a quest in the ro-temple: Staff of Temperate Flux. no you don&#39;t<br/>
need it for fighting, but it has a very nice effect: Lower Element.<br/>
this effect has almost the same range as the damage spells you use when<br/>
kiting/quadding!<br/>
<br/>
so, how does it actually work:<br/>
  - tag monster(s) with a slow spell up to four<br/>
  - group them if necessary - you need them close for your area spells<br/>
    to work<br/>
  - keep moving and area damaging them, until all of them fall apart<br/>
  - don&#39;t get killed yourself<br/>
<br/>
why didn&#39;t i mention the names of the used spells, because druids and<br/>
wizzies use a different set: druids do their &quot;illness and rotting&quot;<br/>
spells, and wizzies use their normal raw forces ones.<br/>
<br/>
a sidenote for wizzies: you need your lvl 29 &quot;Bonds of Force&quot; for this<br/>
task, but this one has a special feature (i don&#39;t know if druids do run<br/>
into the same problem): you can snare yourself with this spell, if you<br/>
cast it on a mob being too close !!! yes, i knew of this feature, and i<br/>
snared myself on the first attempts.<br/>
<br/>
i am not sure if other classes can do this as well, or if it is possible<br/>
to do reverse quadding (using fear), but this sounds very uncommon,<br/>
because i don&#39;t think you can force a group of critters in one direction<br/>
using fear. maybe also some of the druids on this board will give away<br/>
some of the tricks of the trade ... :-)<br/>
<br/>
before i stop, i want to remind you again: people are playing EQ for fun<br/>
and want to enjoy it. and you can easily spoil someones day even if you<br/>
have fun ... think about it !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
take care<br/>
