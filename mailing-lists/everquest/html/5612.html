<div id="ygrps-yiv-523168840">I&#39;ve noticed that dx9 isn&#39;t so great. I was getting used to things with the previous version. I have a GeForce Ti 4600 vid card, 1GB of RAM, 1.4GHz processor... and I keep lagging really badly, have lousy framerate, and zonecrash alot more. I also can&#39;t target corpses. Even with /tar it isn&#39;t working all the time. which sucks for a cleric trying to rez. It&#39;s extremely frustrating. I hope they fix this soon. Oh, and all that is with particle effects off, clip plane set low, and most luclin models off.<br/>
