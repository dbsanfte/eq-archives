<div id="ygrps-yiv-548960267">Ok.. So which one of these is the Southeast camp?<br/>
Camp 1, 2, or 3?<br/>
I never got killed by Qued, but I did kick his arse plenty of times.<br/>
Next time I see him I&#39;ll kick it again, just for you. :-)<br/>
I got irritated bc PegLeg and his group conned green to me yet they managed<br/>
to kill me.<br/>
I think they were waaay underconning.<br/>
I got even though. Now I just have to get even with Embassador Dvinn...<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a side note if you go past the goblin warrior camp you will come to a<br/>
&gt; bandit camp, careful here as the lvl range is large and they have a pretty<br/>
&gt; large argo range for their lvl.  I think they can go from 9 to 14 (peg leg<br/>
&gt; is 14 or so).  Spawn is pretty fast.  1 roamer here spawns on the wall<br/>
&gt; across from the camp and can argo the camp when he runs out to get you.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is just a question about &quot;Oak Bark&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I saw a patch of ground that was a little different from the<br/>
&gt; surrounding<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ground.  Clicked on it...and got an Oak Bark.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Supposedly this is part of an elven (or just wood elf) cultural<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; armor....is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it true that it costs 100pp each?<br/>
