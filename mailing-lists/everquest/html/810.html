Like I said...its a personal issue for me. I think its just common courtesy <br/>
for someone to ASK before inspecting. Its called being polite. I never <br/>
inspect without asking, so I expect the same respect in return.<br/>

  hehee I thought I was the only one bothered by it. Yes...I find it rude if<br/>
  people inspect and don&#39;t ask first. That is like some stranger coming to <br/>
my<br/>
  door and walking in and checking out my CD Collection hehe<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How? I&#39;m totally confused?  Some starnger sees you on the street - he can <br/>
see<br/>
your Boots, your Cloak, your jewelry, your hat.  Do you run away from<br/>
everyone who looks at you in the real world?  Someone walking into my house<br/>
and checking out my CD collection would be rude as hell I agree, but in EQ <br/>
we<br/>
have no homes, so we keep all our possessions in the bank and in item slots<br/>
and containers.  NO ONE CAN SEE THESE!!! As it should be.  I am dumfounded<br/>
that people in EQ are upset that people can see what they have ON THIER<br/>
BODIES.<br/>
