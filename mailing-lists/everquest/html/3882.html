&gt; to contact me, you have two options: in game (tell Biltilie, Delaney,<br/>
&gt; Urva, Udaena, Ldara, Zimboka, or Nadja) or write me an email<br/>
&gt; 	mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:biltilie@...">biltilie@...</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i already got contacted by some people (thank you very much), but i<br/>
would like to add a few lines for those who are interested in helping<br/>
me:<br/>
<br/>
1) i live in germany, so my timezone is CEST (currently GMT+2). i<br/>
think the difference to PST is 8 hours. so 8am PST is 4pm CEST.<br/>
but i might be wrong by one hour, i always mess up with the time :-)<br/>
<br/>
2) during the week i play from 7pm CEST to 10pm CEST, if i am on at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
3) weekends are much better to meet: (most of the time) i am on from<br/>
8am CEST to 10pm CEST with just some small breaks.<br/>
<br/>
4) of course i can help with some money to start with, help with some levels, or get the necessary items for quest levelling <br/>
(only non-evil races).<br/>
<br/>
5) i someone needs something like this on another server, i can<br/>
support you with four accounts ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
6) &quot;we&quot; could also etablish &quot;Latrodectus Mactans&quot; on other servers.<br/>
i have to admit, i really love this guild name ... :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
again, thanks to all the people who want to help me (or us).<br/>
and there is still more room for some more.<br/>
