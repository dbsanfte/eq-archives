<div id="ygrps-yiv-103947414">Specifically, EQ. Just read Thinking Out Loud, and one point I failed <br/>
to see as a hurdle for EQ and EQ style games moving to consoles is <br/>
the difference in gaming philosophy the two camps still hold. Console <br/>
gamers play by themselves, or with up to four others in the same <br/>
room. Interaction in the game, and cooperation to achieve goals, is <br/>
just not part of the console experience.<br/>
<br/>
The social aspect of EQ is boring and a burden to finger twitching <br/>
console players. Action is faster. Rewards are more immediate, in the <br/>
console world.<br/>
<br/>
The addition of online technology to consoles will cause an evolution <br/>
in console games, and over time educate console gamers to a more <br/>
tolerant attitued toward EQ like games. They will learn the value of <br/>
playing cooperatively and attaining in-game goals. But that will take <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately the two worlds will become more integrated, but the time <br/>
frame is an unknown. What ideas will investors back? How will this <br/>
affect the products we can buy, and at what cost?<br/>
<br/>
Again, flexibility will be the key to finding the optimal gaming <br/>
experience. The pc and the console, and whatever new is to come, are <br/>
but the tools for gaming. I see the potential for games to become <br/>
deeper, more involving, and very fulfilling, if we are willing to <br/>
grow with the industry.<br/>
