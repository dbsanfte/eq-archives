<div id="ygrps-yiv-347303259">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also a Beta tester. I&#39;m 51. I was reading the posts on the Beta website<br/>
and the oldest person is 64, (so far), so all ages enjoy the game. Hope you<br/>
are wrong about people not playing because of difficulty getting hooked up.<br/>
Can you buy the network adapter online? I haven&#39;t started yet. When they<br/>
send the disks I&#39;ll get the adapter but I&#39;m wondering if it will be hard to<br/>
find here in Hawaii. If they were smart they would make sure places like<br/>
Wal-Mart had em.<br/>
<br/>
See ya in the game!<br/>

&gt; Hey cool a fellow Beta tester! I got into it also, I&#39;m really<br/>
&gt; excited!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well I don&#39;t know about it being a &quot;kid&#39;s platform&quot; I&#39;m 33 and think<br/>
&gt; it will do great on the PS2. The only thing I think there might be<br/>
&gt; issues with regarding it&#39;s survival is the whol PS2 online part. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know if there will be too many people that will get the adapter<br/>
&gt; or allow their kids to go online with it. Didn&#39;t Nintendo or another<br/>
&gt; gaming console maker try that a few years back but it failed?<br/>
&gt; Personally there were times I wish I had EQ for my PS2 simply to free<br/>
&gt; up my PC for other things. Like I can play EQ all day and the wife<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t have to yell at me to get off the PC so she can use it! LOL<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You said a regular USB keyboard will work on the PS2? Thats cool, I<br/>
&gt; have one so now I won&#39;t have to go buy the PS2 specific one. You know<br/>
&gt; what would be great, if you could use those little USB storage<br/>
&gt; devices to save info on! God that would rock!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW since your also in the Beta, you can PM me anytime and we can<br/>
&gt; chat about the game. :)<br/>
