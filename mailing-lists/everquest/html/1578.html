<b>Subject:</b> SV: [EverQuest] Verant&#39;s new security policy.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297786531">You didn&#39;t read the post from Verant did you? The post said that because it<br/>
takes so much time to investigate hacked accounts, they will from now on<br/>
just ban all accounts that have been compromised.. IE, if someone reports an<br/>
account hacked, and they check that another IP has been logged on to it,<br/>
they just ban it and won&#39;t return it to the rightful owner because it&#39;s OUR<br/>
responsibility to keep our accounts secure.. I feel real sorry for all the<br/>
people that don&#39;t have their own computer and play on a friends computer, or<br/>
at a netcafe, because you don&#39;t have any control over that systems security,<br/>
those people are SOL now.. Verant are f-in lazy that&#39;s my point..<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has been away from EQ on vacation for a month, he was to<br/>
return to playing last week..<br/>
Yesterday he talked to me through a new account he had to buy and told me<br/>
his old account had been banned because someone had hacked his account while<br/>
he was away on vacation.. And no, he won&#39;t get it back because according to<br/>
Verant, it was his fault that someone hacked it..(duh) It&#39;s another thing<br/>
that you give out your account info to a &quot;friend&quot; and that dude hacks it..<br/>
But this was not the case for my guildmate(level 55 rogue with epic etc)..<br/>
<br/>
During the time I have played EQ(from day 1, and even some in beta), I have<br/>
lost over 10 guildmates to different kinds of &quot;hacking&quot;, some were hacked by<br/>
&quot;friends&quot; they gave their info to, and some were just plain hacked..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d gladly PAY to have this service availible to me(Verant investigates and<br/>
does their best to return my account if it is hacked) if I could..<br/>
