<b>Subject:</b> Malted lion skins? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-88159595">Was just running my Halfling Warrior lvl 10 around East Commons. Some <br/>
very interesting new stuff since the last patch(s). Killed a <br/>
woodlands lion and got five items. The usual skins and meat, plus a <br/>
mane and a malted lions skin. Never seen a mane before, but the <br/>
malted is absolutely new to me. Anyone know what these are for?<br/>
<br/>
This character is Bartoo, cousin of my Halfling Druid Barto. Kind of <br/>
an rpg justification for the items Barto may give Bartoo now and then.<br/>
<br/>
For the noobie asking what to play, I can recommend Halfings in <br/>
general just because they have so few faction problems. The druid can <br/>
fight well enough to gain noob experience in Misty and still learn <br/>
casting without too much frustration. Warriors are easy because you <br/>
just have to learn to fight. I use my druid as primary because he can <br/>
solo in travel, combat, and can bind anywhere. I don&#39;t have to depend <br/>
on finding a group, a good thing when one logs on for short bouts of <br/>
gaming and there is no time to find a suitable group.<br/>
