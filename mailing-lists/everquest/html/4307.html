<div id="ygrps-yiv-396697932">I agree... lets drop it. No need to fight, especially over a little <br/>
misunderstanding. I can, however, see how many of you would jump to your <br/>
defenses... I was not aware that there have been a few scammers in the group <br/>
in the past. Sorry for jumping to conclusions. Oh, and thanks for fixing <br/>
that little problem with the auto. messages, Su. It was getting annoying, <br/>
LOL. To whoever it was that is seeking platnum... although it&#39;s very hard, <br/>
you could kill giants in the Frontier Mountains. Some of them drop Forest <br/>
Loops that sell for 300 platnum. However, like I said, it&#39;s rare that they <br/>
drop them, but I have looted one from before. It just takes patience, <br/>
although the experience sucks... it did for me anyway.<br/>
