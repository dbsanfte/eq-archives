<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-137166060">Thank you very much indeed for your quick response :-)<br/>
<br/>
My son has used /petition to contact a gm and explained what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding patches - how often do these occur? The concern is that the <br/>
EQ autoloader downloads everything on startup. I assume that the data <br/>
with respect to each character are stored on the EQ server and no the <br/>
local PC?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks once again!<br/>
<br/>
