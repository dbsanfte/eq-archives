<div id="ygrps-yiv-337274913">Hi gang,<br/>
	I have recently installed a new HD in my PC and re-installed EQ.<br/>
Now whenever I go to log in and play it tells me that &quot;eqgame.exe has<br/>
generated errors and is being closed by Windows.&quot; This is only when I go<br/>
to play, I can get into chat fine. I have un-installed and re-installed<br/>
EQ twice and I still get the error. Has anyone else been getting this<br/>
message or does anyone have any ideas how to fix it? All my drivers are<br/>
up to date btw. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Durgaa</div>
