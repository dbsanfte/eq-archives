<div id="ygrps-yiv-807122441">I have to agree with you on AC.. I&#39;m part beta program, however i rarely<br/>
play it now.. its neat when you first start playing.. then you find out that<br/>
the game just sucks.. :)  cant put it any other way.  Graphics are ok.. but<br/>
the world is so large and the distance between them is almost unbearable.<br/>
Its really annoying running for what seems forever, then losing your best<br/>
item you spent all your loot on miles from where you last bound yourself.<br/>
Hehe..  The AC world is so empty, almost as empty as their dungeons. :)<br/>
<br/>
For those that don&#39;t know.. when you die in AC you temporary lose some of<br/>
your stat numbers and..  your best item.   This item.. which is now<br/>
available to anyone walking by.  nice aye.  EQ example...  One minute you<br/>
have your rubi tunic, when you return to your corpse you find that a level 1<br/>
guy is now sporting your hard earned tunic.. Welcome to AC. hehe<br/>

AC and UO both suck ass. You should have tried ac last week during open<br/>
beta. I logged in and ran around for a while.. It seemed ok but all the<br/>
things I thought that were nice about it later on sucked<br/>
its annoying as hell plus the graphics suck, monster AI is sucky so you can<br/>
solo your whole way to the top without getting hurt for 1 point of damage<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m rather fed up with Verant! They&#39;re constantly nerfing everything<br/>
ingame<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s worth while, or ignoring classes that need to be balanced or<br/>
&gt; upgraded! So in retrospect, I&#39;m looking to find greener pastures<br/>
elsewhere.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps someone out there knows of another game (other than AC and UO) or<br/>
&gt; perhaps a group who&#39;s programming their own game similar to EQ? If so,<br/>
&gt; please don&#39;t hesistate to drop me a line or two via email. Tks in advance!<br/>
