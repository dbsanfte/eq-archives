If you have Luclin I suggest you get some friends (especially ones with vs<br/>
undead spells) and head to Umbral Planes to hunt for Elysian Armor. I<br/>
brought my mother&#39;s lvl 41 druid to sit invis on the sidelines while my 56<br/>
cleric and a 52 druid soloed the elysian mobs. She snared and dotted them<br/>
and kited them until I rooted them and used my undead dots. I was doing<br/>
190dmg every 6 seconds with my dots. They do have alot of HP though. and<br/>
they hit pretty hard. The arms dropped twice and so did the tunic. So both<br/>
druids got arms and tunic. It was fun!<br/>
luv,<br/>

But my druid has finally dinged level 50!!!    WOOT!!!! *MAD CELEBRATION*<br/>
<br/>
Man, it&#39;s been a long time coming!   If I feel this ecstatic about level 50<br/>
think how I&#39;m gonna be at 65!  by the time I hti that they&#39;ll have raised<br/>
the level cap to 70!<br/>
<br/>
I just recently purchased LDON but my cable modem got disconnected so I<br/>
could not play for like 2 months.  I moved to a new place and got cable<br/>
modem reconnected and finally had my first adventure tonight!!  I did the<br/>
Collect 28 Mummy Wrappings in Mistmore, and also the Kill 60 in Mistmore.<br/>
Successful on both and dinged 50 to boot!!<br/>
<br/>
Time to start working on my epic I guess!<br/>
