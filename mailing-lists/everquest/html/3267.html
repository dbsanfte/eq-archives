 </span></blockquote>There a lot of newbie armor quests out there now.  I heard the <br/>
Gnomes armor were going to be in the next patch.  You might check the <br/>
Arcane Order Armor quests in Qeynos, or the similar ones in <br/>
Freeport.  These all have minor stats on them, but they&#39;re better <br/>
than cloth and sometimes even raw silk.  You are well above the level <br/>
range for them so they should be easy to get.<br/>
