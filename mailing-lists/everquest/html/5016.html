<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134209170">You should also /con them.  There are quests where the npc will talk <br/>
to you but ignore your turn in&#39;s if your faction is too low.  Or you <br/>
could have lowered your faction without knowing it.  Been there, done <br/>
that! :(<br/>

&gt; Okay this question is very stupid but I haven&#39;t done a lot of the <br/>
quests so I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know. When you go to turn in your quest items, do you need to <br/>
hail the <br/>
&gt; person first? Because when I just gave them the items, they took <br/>
them but I <br/>
&gt; got no rewards. So I&#39;m guessing that happened because I didn&#39;t hail <br/>
them first <br/>
&gt; but wanted to be sure that was the reason.<br/>
