<b>Subject:</b> EQ video question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372958601">I just bought a new machine and have a question.  I<br/>
had some Mouse issues but I solved those but now I get<br/>
a little skip in the movement when I run or walk.  <br/>
<br/>
It is like frame by frame.  The machine is a 1.2 GHZ<br/>
machine with 384 Ram and 32 MB video card.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my question is, &quot;Does the video card with EQ make<br/>
the difference or is it RAM?&quot;  The reason I ask is<br/>
because when you choose the Luclin images it tells you<br/>
how many to pick based on Ram and not Video memory.<br/>
<br/>
So does EQ use RAM more so than Video ram or not?<br/>
I don&#39;t mind getting a 64 MB video card but I want it<br/>
to work.<br/>
<br/>
My friend also sees the same issues but only has 256<br/>
mb ram<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
