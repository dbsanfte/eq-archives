<div id="ygrps-yiv-333289470">Hi!<br/>
Sorry I took so long to respond. Been busy doing construction/cleanup/repair<br/>
at the house and junk.<br/>
I have a 40Gb primary and 120Gb secondary drive.<br/>
I started having even worse problems where my character got stuck after<br/>
going LD in various zones and then had to wait for a week for a walkout from<br/>
a GM. I could get my other characters into the same zone and I had no active<br/>
character warnings. I deleted and repatched zone files, deleted skins<br/>
folder, deleted eqclient, deleted all files with that characters name.<br/>
reloaded all the stuff. rebooted. defragged, diskcleanup, scandisk.. and I<br/>
still had the problem. After the umpteenth walkout and several calls to tech<br/>
support they told me there were brand new drivers for my video card to dl.<br/>
So I dled those drivers and so far haven&#39;t had problems. But I haven&#39;t<br/>
played enough since then to find out if the problem is completely gone. The<br/>
bazaar problem I think is just because my connection is too slow to handle<br/>
the lag from too many people in the zone and I just go LD.<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions though. :-)<br/>
luv,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Su, i just had another idea about your Bazaar problems:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; how much space do you have availible on your harddisk?<br/>
&gt; is there enough room for your swapfile?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; besides, if you enable EQ texture caching, it will also<br/>
&gt; eat up harddisk space.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; one more thing to add: when did you run defrag the last<br/>
&gt; time?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; just an idea...<br/>
