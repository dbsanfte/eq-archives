  <div><br></div><tt>Actually, my job is great for playing. I work 12 hour days, 
  but only <br>three days one week and four the next, on two week pay periods. 
  That <br>means I only have to work 14 days a month.<br><br>The downside is 
  that on work days I have time for work, eating, <br>commuting and sleeping, 
  but for little else. I usually log on for <br>about one hour on those days and 
  work on trade skills. Often too <br>tired to do even that.<br><br>On the days 
  off I am not babysitting my grandchildren I can have nice <br>long sessions. 
  <br><br>As for vacations, I earn vacation at a high rate and often have to 
  <br>take days off just to burn the time. If I don&#39;t use it, I lose 
  it.<br><br>If I take one of my three day weeks off I burn only 36 hrs. and get 
  <br>10 days off. <br><br>I don&#39;t have the stamina to do 10 or 12 hr. sessions, 
  but can do <br>three 3 hr. sessions a day on some days off.<br><br>This is 
  great, but if I retire I can play all of the time. None of <br>that wasted 
  time working. After a great many years of working I can <br>say definitively 
  that work sucks. Gaming is far better.<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br>--- In

  Move<br>&gt; &gt; back. Click. <br>&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t have object. Click again. 
  Hmph. Had object but<br>&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t know it, <br>&gt; &gt; and just put 
  it back. Click...<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Took so long that I didn&#39;t finish 
  setting up before<br>&gt; &gt; I had to log. I <br>&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t have 
  logged if I could have left my toon to<br>&gt; &gt; do business <br>&gt; &gt; 
  while I was gone, but no such luck.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I just gotta 
  get another machine, faster connection,<br>&gt; &gt; and retire from <br>&gt;
