<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EverQuest] Disciplines? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168614240">Yeah. They&#39;re bought for 2 cp each in the PoK Library. Full melee classes<br/>
get them around 30th level, while hybrids have to wait until 51st (my main,<br/>
a ranger, is just about nearing the point where I can get his first<br/>
Discipline -- the Resistant Discipline, I believe, which is the one warriors<br/>
get at 30th or 31st).<br/>
<br/>
Disciplines have been in the game for some time now. Someone who has been in<br/>
the game for a few years could probably shed more light on exactly how old<br/>
they are. I&#39;ve only played since January 2003, and I think they might&#39;ve<br/>
been around at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have the Discipline book, you open it and learn the Discipline.<br/>
Each Discipline has certain benefits (Resistant bumps up all your<br/>
resistances, for instances). They last for a certain amount of time, but you<br/>
can only use them once every X number of hours of play. There&#39;s a window<br/>
that you can pull up (can&#39;t remember the command to open it up) that lets<br/>
you activate the Disciplines.<br/>

I know they are for melee classes. I think you have to buy books from a<br/>
merchant of your class to get disciplines. I think there might be AA ones as<br/>
well. I don&#39;t play melee class so I don&#39;t know. Maybe a monk, rogue, or<br/>
warrior could shed some more light.<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t be of more help.<br/>
