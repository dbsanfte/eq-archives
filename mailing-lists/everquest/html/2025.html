<div id="ygrps-yiv-188644751">I understand you feel strongly about this, but you don&#39;t need to resort to<br/>
insulting people.<br/>
EQ could easily survive if they didn&#39;t constantly change the graphics and<br/>
such on the game bc the game is so dynamic with so many places to explore<br/>
and things to do that they could leave it the same way for 3 years and many<br/>
people would be happy.<br/>
Developing things for old tech, so long as it will work with new tech is<br/>
smart. It gives them a broader customer base. Have you ever taken any<br/>
business classes?<br/>

<br/>
Sorry Su, but here&#39;s your tissue.<br/>
<br/>
Gawd damn you whine alot.<br/>
<br/>
Some facts:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;are you saying that people with more money are more important?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, a customer with money is alot more important to a company that is<br/>
trying to make a good earning than a customer without money. A customer with<br/>
money adds a flavor of long lasting customer relation ships. You however,<br/>
doesn&#39;t meet these standards (you self who said it). So, you think Verant<br/>
should keep the old game just cause some of the old customers, who btw<br/>
bought this game which clearly stated on the bottom of the box that OS and<br/>
hardware requirments could/will change, can&#39;t pay for the new produc that.<br/>
You know the product that will keep EQ alive and not let it die before the<br/>
end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Get real Su, if they wouldn&#39;t have updated EQ they wouldnt survive a month.<br/>
A company that chose to develop shit for a old tech ain&#39;t a company with a<br/>
long lasting future.<br/>

I have seen my friend&#39;s computer run. Trust me, it can&#39;t handle Luclin. It<br/>
probably can&#39;t handle velious come to think of it. But now that I think<br/>
about it, his system is probably considered obsolete to most &quot;serious<br/>
gamers&quot;.<br/>
Don&#39;t mind me. I&#39;m stressed out bc my neighbor stole stuff from me and had<br/>
the gall to cuss at my mother when she asked where the stuff was when he was<br/>
the only one who could&#39;ve taken it. (and so I don&#39;t sound like I&#39;m just<br/>
jumping to conclusions, he was a tenant in our house for awhile and alot of<br/>
the stuff we left in his care is gone).<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
going through unpacking hell right now. moving sucks.<br/>

&gt; My sister had a brand new computer-- not a doorstop but even it couldn&#39;t<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Theres a difference between low end and a door stop.  EQ still<br/>
&gt; &gt; supports<br/>
&gt; low<br/>
&gt; &gt; end.  It&#39;s the obsolete systems that were still able to play before<br/>
&gt; &gt; that have been left in the cold.  Don&#39;t worry they will find a way to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play.<br/>
&gt; Make<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure ya buy the right memory, if ya need help let us know.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes, and maybe $265 isn&#39;t that much for you. But to some other people<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; a hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; rent-to-own basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; easy to say they should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; &gt; escape for them. To<br/>
&gt; suddenly<br/>
&gt; &gt; not be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so<br/>
&gt; &gt; financially stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if<br/>
&gt; &gt; nothing else. Btw, someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Where was that again? I just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of<br/>
&gt; &gt; RAM with it&#39;s motherboard<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; chipset. luv, -Su<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not cost<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; $265 after tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The chip is a AMD Athlon 950.<br/>
