<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It&#39;s not that a hub is any slower or faster than a 
router.&nbsp; If it&#39;s 10/100 then it either works on a 10Mb connection or a 
100Mb connection.&nbsp; Standard ethernet is only 10Mb so it&#39;s gonna be the same 
bandwidth regardless.&nbsp; The difference between a router and a hub is largely 
hardware oriented.&nbsp; A hub is merely a pass through device.&nbsp; The signal 
is shared among all the ports on the hub and the computer with the correct 
address will pick it up.&nbsp; The other computers just ignore or discard the 
information since the networking protocols recognize it is not for them.&nbsp; A 
router, on the other hand, is a bit smarter than that.&nbsp; It assigns a 
specific address to each computer on the network.&nbsp; Then when a signal is 
sent with a specific address, the router will send it directly to where it 
should go rather than sharing it across all ports.&nbsp; I suppose this could 
make a router seem faster.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, routers have their own software 
controlled interface and usually come with built in firewalls thus makign them 
more secure than a hub.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>I vaguely recall that hubs are slower than routers so 
  routers are the way to<br>go.<br>winxp network thingy is really pissy. 
  sometimes you have to reboot multiple<br>times or even run the network setup 
  wizard over and over to keep it working.<br>It is a royal pain. Lately mine 
  has been ok though.<br>Oh, as for finding routers you can look them up at <a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.pricegrabber.com">www.pricegrabber.com</a>. It<br>lets you 
  add in your zip code to factor in shipping costs. It sorts by the<br>best 
  price and has customer ratings on the products as well as customer<br>ratings 
  of the stores that are offering it. So if the lowest priced store<br>has a bad 
  rating, you can choose to get one slightly more expensive at a<br>more 
  reliable store. I personally like yesmicro.com. I&#39;ve ordered from 
  them<br>numerous times. I think with yesmicro you get a discount if you order 
  a<br>product after locating it on www.pricewatch.com. I tend to look for it 
  on<br>pricegrabber then check for it on pricewatch. Another site for info 
  on<br>products is www.epinions.com. I tend to use all 3 to help determine 
  what<br>product I want.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
