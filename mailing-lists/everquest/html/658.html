&gt; the other day as my friends and I were killing aviak guards in lakerathe<br/>
&gt; we came upon a passageway under 3 bird island, I stripped off my<br/>
&gt; equipment and let someone else hold it, got an enduring breath and went<br/>
&gt; down to explore, inside it opened up into a large underwater cavern, the<br/>
&gt; only structure I found within was what appreared to be a tower guarded<br/>
&gt; by 6 dw gobs with a trausre chest inside and something else I didn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; a look at, does anyone know anything about this? I would sure like to<br/>
&gt; know more, from what I&#39;ve heard from the few people who&#39;ve even heard of<br/>
&gt; it, it leads to a dw gob city. if anyone knows anything about it please<br/>
&gt; e-mail me, I also have screenshots of what I saw. thanks.<br/>
