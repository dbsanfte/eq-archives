<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100890194">I always remebered when doing tailoring armors and the what not meant<br/>
either giving it to people or they bought it from you.  That and the other<br/>
things people have metioned.  Once the bazaar came into being the<br/>
tradeskills sort of went downhill.  I use the bazaar and tradeskills some,<br/>
but i miss the good oled days.  I would try out the classsic for fun nad the<br/>
good old days.<br/>
