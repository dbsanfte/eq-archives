<div>&nbsp;</div><tt><br>Yesterday (11/25/04) Kuyena and I werre over in Butcherblock trying to<br>find her a Basalisk tounge to help finish her armor quest. Anyway<br>after I poped in through the book there was a Barbarian Shaman<br>standing there. Her name was Shaman Traxa and she was asking for<br>certain items. At first I couldn&#39;t tell if she was a real player who<br>had bad faction and couldn&#39;t go get the stuff because the guards would<br>KOS her or if she was a new NPC, when doing a /who she would not show<br>up. There was a froggy there by the name of Rattlehead who was trying<br>to find the stuff so I asked her if this was a quest or a real person.<br>Rattlehead didn&#39;t know herself so I began to ask Shaman Traxa some<br>questions to try and find out. <br><br>Shaman Traxa would do things that really threw me off, she acted like<br>a NPC but then acted like a player. I would ask her if she was a real<br>player or a NPC and she replied with &quot;What is a NPC?&quot; and then I<br>apologiezed for being rude (if she was a real person) and explained<br>why I was asking all the questions and told her I am confused about<br>her and she replied &quot;What confused?&quot; I wish I would have turned my<br>/log on to have gotten the full text but as you can see by her actions<br>(sitting and casting SoW on another toon) and her text it was as if<br>she was a RL player but not quite. Anyway after recieving all the<br>items she would turn into a red Dragon and then attack you. Oh and<br>during this time&nbsp; there would be little things like in emote text it<br>would say &quot;Shaman Traxa opens a book and begins to read from it.&quot;<br>followed by yellow text &quot;Sparks flash across the sky&quot;. And when she<br>turned into a dragon there was in yellow text a<br>&quot;SCHREEEEEAAAAACCCCHHHHHHH!&quot;. Anyway there was another person there<br>named Cometome who was a much higher level toon buffing and healing us<br>while we were fighting Shaman Traxa. He told me that only lowbies can<br>kill it when I said I was going to go get Durgaa. Upon killing Shaman<br>Traxa the loot was all the items we had gathered per her request plus<br>a Fire Emerald. Oh and after she killed Rattlehead she summoned her<br>back and Rattlehead was in her exact image.<br><br>So my thoughts on this was it was either a GM event, (I know I already<br>got into a debate with someone about what &quot;uber level&quot; GM events<br>usually are), A new quest in Butcher Block, A test of something new by<br>Sony such as using AI (Artificial Intelligence), or a real player<br>doing all this. I&#39;ve heard rumors that you can now go to other servers<br>with your toons but I haven&#39;t tried it yet. If so can a PVP go to a<br>non-PVP server? Maybe this was the case and some guys wanted to have<br>some fun? But why did Shaman Traxa not appear on /who then? So many<br>questions - so little answers. If anyone has seen anything on this or<br>knows anything about it please let me know! I can&#39;t sleep at night<br>anymore!&nbsp; LOL<br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br>
