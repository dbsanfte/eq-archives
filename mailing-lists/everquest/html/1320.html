I actually use an assist macro:<br/>
<br/>
/target &lt;puller/maintank name&gt;<br/>
/pause 4<br/>
/g Assisting %t<br/>
/assist<br/>
/g Attacking %t.  Let&#39;s kick it&#39;s ass.<br/>
<br/>
Now if you are not using assist with auto attack, you can either put in /attack into one of the lines in the macro or simply do hit the &quot;g&quot; key(my attack key) after the macro goes off and you have the mob targeted.  You can change the last /g message to whatever you like(Don&#39;t run! We are your friends or whatever).  Also, since I am in so many pickup groups in DL, my first line gets edited for each group I join with the name of the main puller/tank - you could target your puller and not have this line, but I find it easier for me.  The /pause is to allow things to process - for my normal lag and such, it is needed - not everyone has to have a /pause.  Btw, you can include a pause combined with another command on the same line:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 4, /target &lt;name&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The pause occurs after the targeting.  Don&#39;t ask why, just the way it works.  I separted the two since I change my /target line a lot - I am lazy about certain things.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

Wow! Thank you so much! I had no idea how to setup the macros. i was<br/>
wondering how people did it! This will help me alot!<br/>
How do I set up an attack macro that says something everytime I start to<br/>
attack? Like if I want to say &quot;Don&#39;t run! We aer your friends&quot; when I begin<br/>
attacking?<br/>
luv,<br/>
