<div id="ygrps-yiv-187531804">I have started another char in Rivale as a halfling<br/>
and I am finding it a LOT easier.<br/>
Better land marks, a road that leads right back to the<br/>
city.  Not many play in this zone though. At most I<br/>
have seen 10 people when I have played.  In Kelethin,<br/>
I have seen more than 70.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are more merchants and stuff to get your<br/>
hands on in Kelething but I hate wandering around the<br/>
treetops always running in circles.<br/>
<br/>
So I figure once I get the game mechanics down and<br/>
experience behind me, I can start another char in<br/>
Kelethin.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you and I would agree on this one,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; &gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or<br/>
&gt; Loot my corpse? The<br/>
&gt; &gt; book says no but I beg to differ. Is it possible<br/>
&gt; that I had two corpses<br/>
&gt; &gt; out there? Meaning, When I went back with a dead<br/>
&gt; body I died again?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which meant I found the wrong corpse?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you /consent &lt;Char name&gt; they can MOVE your body,<br/>
&gt; but on a non-pvp<br/>
&gt; server they can&#39;t remove anything from your corpse.<br/>
&gt; on a PVP server rules<br/>
&gt; are different, and (I think) depends on wether they<br/>
&gt; killed you or not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now?<br/>
&gt; seeing as I have no<br/>
&gt; &gt; food, no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I beg or do I<br/>
&gt; start another char? This<br/>
&gt; &gt; game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to<br/>
&gt; learn which way to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; all the time and dying, it is starting to get to<br/>
&gt; me, I don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; give up just yet and I turned to this board since<br/>
&gt; the Chat from the game<br/>
&gt; &gt; options was USELESS.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a personal choice, can keep on going, or<br/>
&gt; start over.  The zone<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re in is IMHO hard to learn since so few<br/>
&gt; landmarks, but many people<br/>
&gt; feel is the best starting zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Corpse decay:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for a nude body, it&#39;ll decay (vanish) in 5 minutes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for a low level char (think below 20?) body with<br/>
&gt; items will decay in 30<br/>
&gt; minutes of online time(i.e. if logged in to game),<br/>
&gt; or 24 hours if not<br/>
&gt; logged in (EQ not running on your machine)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for a high level char (20+) body with items will<br/>
&gt; decay in something like<br/>
&gt; 24 hours online, or 1 week offline.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; note that &#39;online&#39; includes time logged in as other<br/>
&gt; chars, and reportadly<br/>
&gt; even if in chat server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There have been rumors that after corpse decay items<br/>
&gt; stick around slightly<br/>
&gt; longer(and could be picked up by anyone) but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; never heard of this<br/>
&gt; actually happening, and I&#39;ve seen many a corpse<br/>
&gt; decay, so I don&#39;t belive<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s true.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
