<b>Subject:</b> Re: I have a question about eqgame.exe <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708977620">I recall having that problem after a patch. It was not corrected <br/>
until the next patch. I suppose if you have a copy of that file which <br/>
is current and uncorrupted, you could replace it. I didn&#39;t have such, <br/>
so only got a fix with the next patch.<br/>
