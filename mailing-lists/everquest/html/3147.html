<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Wireless Mice <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269050876">I&quot;ve found that I like my graphire tablet from WACOM. the tablet itself<br/>
plugs into the USB port and a regular mouse can work in conjunction with it.<br/>
It comes with a little crappy wireless mouse (no batteries required) and a<br/>
pen. It can be plugged and unplugged while the computer is on, and is easy<br/>
to install. I think it&#39;s a better solution than a battery powered or<br/>
rechargeable device.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Anyone else using a wireless mouse? My son installed one on our<br/>
&gt; computer. I have mixed feelings. When it is good it is very, very<br/>
&gt; good. When it is bad, it sucks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the most part, it is nice to be free of wires. This one is radio,<br/>
&gt; not infra-red. Not bad, until it runs out of juice when you are doing<br/>
&gt; something important. Don&#39;t forget to put it in it&#39;s docking station<br/>
&gt; to recharge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t put it in the docking station with care, it calls up a<br/>
&gt; help window. That is a pain, since the screen saver and monitor shut<br/>
&gt; off don&#39;t seem to want to work while the help window is open. A<br/>
&gt; little care prevents this, but what a pain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The up side is that you can re-arrange your gaming hardware<br/>
&gt; configuration to suit your tastes without worrying about the mouse<br/>
&gt; cable. This wireless stuff may be rather nice once the bugs are<br/>
&gt; worked out.<br/>
