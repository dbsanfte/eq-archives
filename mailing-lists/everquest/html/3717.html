<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490819186">In the case of the shark thingy if you have invis to animals up and on you<br/>
that should keep the shark off of you.  A former Guildy used that  and it<br/>
worked.<br/>

&gt; Very cool...  I have alot of work on my epic to do still...  although I do<br/>
have a few pieces of it.  Went to a raid in CoM a few weeks ago  & got the<br/>
drops off of lord ghiosk =D  I still have to do the test&#39;s of wisdom,<br/>
patience, and might.  Tried the test of patience with my BF&#39;s bard (using<br/>
enduring breath, and Bard invis...) Got through the first 3 spawns,  and got<br/>
attacked by a killer shark =/  so I have not gone back yet..  need to do it<br/>
soon.(another reason I have not gone back, is I have been playing my cleric<br/>
alot =D)<br/>
