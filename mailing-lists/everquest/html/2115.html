Ämne: [EverQuest] Lag in zones<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just added the necessary memory to max out my system. <br/>
Unfortunately, that max is 256. I would love to go to 512 or more, <br/>
but that would require a new system.<br/>
<br/>
Things have improved with the added memory, but I still get lots of <br/>
lag in Rivervale, and similar town type zones. My graphics card is an <br/>
Nvidia TNT 64 (don&#39;t know what the 64 means, it is 32meg). It is the <br/>
best I could find last year for the money I had, and more than <br/>
adequate for the game at that time. I needed pci, so my choices were <br/>
a bit limited. More than that, my knowledge was much less in those <br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious as to what kinds of graphics cards people use, and <br/>
whether or not they are experiencing lag in zones like Rivervale in <br/>
spite of having a pretty good system.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a killer rig, and still find lag or other problems? I <br/>
just wonder how much is the game, how much my now low end system.<br/>
