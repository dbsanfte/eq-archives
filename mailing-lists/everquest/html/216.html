<b>Subject:</b> A question regarding quests... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-717260044">I&#39;ve seen lots of quests listed on various web pages, and have considered<br/>
running through a few.  However, the one quest I have done was not worth the<br/>
effort, though the role-playing was fun.<br/>
<br/>
What quests are worth attempting?  And for what reason (role-playing or<br/>
financial)?<br/>
<br/>
