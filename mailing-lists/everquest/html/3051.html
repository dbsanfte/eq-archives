<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Paladins are the 4th best healers and second best 
damage absorbers.&nbsp;Excellent hp and ac buffers too, at 49 they can give you 
507 hp and 39AC. At 60 they can give you 975hp and 47AC, using 4 buff spots. 
That is really good, not so good for epic encounters but I would certainly want 
a paladin as a partner. Druids can give you 400hp and 20AC but they have regen 
components(life or mana)&nbsp;added which is really nice too. Shaman can give 
you 400hp and 27AC and 67str and 50dex. I think Paladins are the second best at 
raising hp and ac behind clerics who can give you 1100hp and 54AC, using one 
spell. Incidentally, Rangers can give you 325hp, 42AC, 4pt damage shield and 
20ATK, using 3 spells. Just for the hell of it, beastlords can give you 250hp, 
18AC, Str and&nbsp;Dex. Enchanters&nbsp;can give you 26AC. &nbsp;</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Let&#39;s look at this.&nbsp; I&#39;ve played most of the 
  classes into the teens, most to the lower 20&#39;s finding out grouping and 
  soloablity of each, to decide what ones I wanted to play.&nbsp; Shadowknights 
  and Paladins make good backup tanks, and main tanks.&nbsp; both get the same 
  weapon skills, as the Shadowknight is the &quot;anti-paladin&quot;.&nbsp; Both get Dual 
  Attack at level 20, which means they get a free hit from time to time.&nbsp; 
  Dual wield (1 hand weapon in each hand) is only gotten by monks, beastlords, 
  rogues, rangers, and warriors.&nbsp; as far as spells, paladins get some of 
  the cleric line of spells, including the buffs, heals, and resurrection 
  spells.&nbsp; Shadowknights get necromancer spells, and even though they are 
  powerful spells for the necro when he gets them, they just add to the power of 
  a Shadowknight.&nbsp; at level 9, the shadowknight spells are some of the 
  necro level 1 and 4 spells.&nbsp; the pet is a level 4 pet.&nbsp; throughout 
  his career, the pet an Sk has will never be much more than half his level, and 
  rarely will it be that (more easily thought of as a walking DoT).&nbsp; 
  Neither class gets the spell gate.&nbsp; </font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">for soloing and grouping, it depends upon 
  tactics, and knowing the strength and weaknesses of your class, in order to be 
  successful with either, or both.&nbsp; </font></div>

    <div><br></div><tt>Another class that might be good is shadowknight. The 
    drawbacks: Good races<br>won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want to 
    kill you. If you play a<br>darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally 
    suck but you get pretty<br>cool armor when you can manage to find all the 
    stuff you need for it. People<br>don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they 
    think of tanks. They don&#39;t often<br>invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they 
    get the spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br>The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon 
    a pet to tank for you<br>while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, 
    and you get a spell that<br>snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can 
    solo alot and are a good<br>asset to a group. Way later in the game you get 
    to summon your own horse<br>called an Unholy Steed.<br>My brother started a 
    shadowknight and got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br><br>Paladins are welcome in 
    all good cities. Don&#39;t usually have problems selling<br>to merchants. Get 
    good damage, duel wield, disarm. Are thought of as tanks<br>and can get into 
    group. Can also heal and buff. Can even resurrect. But they<br>cannot gate. 
    They can solo pretty well with a good weapon and armor. There<br>are newbie 
    paladin armor quests for humans and halfelves in freeport.<br><br>Druids, 
    not really great tanks but can snare/root and dot from afar. sucks<br>alot 
    of mana. Sometimes they can charm an animal to attack a mob for them.<br>But 
    then the animal turns and attacks them when charm wears off. They 
    can<br>also track, port, and heal.<br><br>If you like things to be more 
    difficult, there&#39;s clerics. They can pretty<br>much get into any group 
    because people always seem to want a healer. But<br>they can&#39;t really solo 
    much and have alot of downtime from medding.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br>&gt; 
    It depends on your playstyle. Solo or group, this will matter a lot 
    later,<br>&gt; the druid you can solo all the way to level60 with if you 
    want and can<br>group<br>&gt; up, but the warrior will have problems 
    crossing the road without getting<br>&gt; killed without a healer back him 
    up. But the warrior is in need in numbers<br>&gt; in the highe end raiding 
    game where the druid is an assist class.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Answer is: it 
    depends on your goals.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br>&gt;
