makes no sense to go that route.  The armor that drops <br/>
for the &quot;Giant&quot; quests only drops in West ToV, which <br/>
means you will have to be in a good high level guild to <br/>
start questing for it (unless you have the cash to buy <br/>
MQ pieces).  Meanwhile, with Dorf faction, you can go on <br/>
Kael raids and kill giants in the Arena (which are much <br/>
lower level) and get armor that way.  Plenty if servers <br/>
have people that run &quot;public&quot; Kael raids, so you don&#39;t <br/>
even have to be in a high level guild to get that armor.<br/>
<br/>
And eventually, if your guild is good enough, you can <br/>
start going into ToV and questing for the Dragon armor <br/>
quests in the Halls of Testing (which is a bit easier to <br/>
do than West ToV).</div>
