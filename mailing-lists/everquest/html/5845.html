<div id="ygrps-yiv-953714450">Wow! I don&#39;t know if this site will help you. I&#39;ve used it in the <br/>
past and recommend it to anyone looking for an ISP.<br/>

&gt; I can&#39;t get ISDN.<br/>
&gt; I also can&#39;t get snail mail delivery, trash pickup, pizza <br/>
delivery, full phonelines, or paved roads. I&#39;m 10 miles out from <br/>
town in the middle of the woods.<br/>
&gt; Before satellite I had dialup that only had 19.2k bandwidth <br/>
because my phonelines suck and the phone company refused to fix <br/>
them. They are the only phone company available to me in my <br/>
particular area. In the city they have full phonelines going to each <br/>
house, but out here they decided to be cheap and split up a line <br/>
that should go to one house to serve several houses. The box the <br/>
lines are in got knocked over and the lines have probably been <br/>
damaged. Whenever it rains my lines get even worse, but the phone <br/>
company denies there is a problem and won&#39;t send anyone out to look. <br/>
The last time I dialed up when I lost connection from satellite <br/>
during a thunderstorm I used dialup but only connected at 6k. So my <br/>
phonelines now provide less bandwidth than legally required.<br/>
&gt; So satellite was the lesser of the 2 evils. I do get some latency, <br/>
but I can download about 800k.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t generally have lag issues.  I have a cable modem <br/>
connection and I turn off some game options that would cause lag, <br/>
like Spell Effects, full names, etc.  And in some places, if <br/>
necessary, I&#39;ll drop the clipp plane down a little.  So assumng I&#39;m <br/>
running at full speed with no lag, I still have a hard time soloing <br/>
the tasks, even as a 64 druid, mainly because of miscellaneous aggro <br/>
in close quarters.  Sure I can kite one or two mobs, but in close <br/>
quarters, where adds are coming out of the woodwork, even greenies <br/>
can beat you down.  I&#39;m not big on soloing per se.  It takes too <br/>
long and requires too much attention.  I prefer grouping anyway.  XP <br/>
is much quicker, and in a full group that knows what they&#39;re doing, <br/>
I only have to snare/dot once per round as opposed to 2 or 3 per <br/>
(high level) mob.So I don&#39;t waste nearly as much mana meaning I can <br/>
do other things like back up heal, buff sporadically, or be <br/>
available to evac if necessary.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand that some people are limited to what kind of <br/>
connections they can get in certain geographical areas, but <br/>
personally I don&#39;t think satellite is one of the best connections to <br/>
play EQ.  You should try for an ISDN connection at least.  <br/>
Connection would probably be more stable, and your uplink would be <br/>
roughly same speed as your downlink.<br/>
