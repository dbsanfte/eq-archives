<b>Subject:</b> Re: SV: SV: [EverQuest] Verant&#39;s new security policy.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-460723820">I suspect alot of it is to cover for people who sell their accounts on ebay<br/>
or via this medium (email mailing lists) who after they receive payment,<br/>
call Verant up and say that someone &quot;hacked&quot; their account-- providing them<br/>
with the original info about their account so that the people who purchased<br/>
the account have it taken away.<br/>
On a similar note, people go into stores, open EQ boxes, write down the<br/>
keycode and then sell it to people to use for warez downloads of EQ (or use<br/>
it themselves). Then whoever buys the actual software tries to use the<br/>
keycode but it&#39;s already used. And all verant tells them is that they must<br/>
be entering the keycode wrong. (the moral message? Don&#39;t buy an EQ game if<br/>
the box looks like it&#39;s been opened or tampered with). My sister had that<br/>
happen. She was lucky that the store she bouth EQ from had a return policy.<br/>
