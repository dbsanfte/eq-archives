<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122729073">Hi Stephanie,<br/>
	Yea, you have to do it that way now. I just started back up too and it <br/>
threw me off a little at first. I was having issues with my video <br/>
settings and was getting the &quot;eqgame.exe has generated errors&quot; message <br/>
and it was driving me nuts! I finally had to boost my paging file size <br/>
and do a couple of other things but it finally started working.<br/>
<br/>
You should be able to just use your old station name and pword, I was <br/>
able to after 5 months of being gone.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and happy adventuring!<br/>
<br/>
