<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-699324497">i am using an old geforce 1 card and and a geforce 2 card in a seperate <br/>
systems, i found that there is no performance diffrence between the 2, the <br/>
only thing that seemed to make any diffrence was the amount of mem in each <br/>
system, with the system that only had 128 being jerky and slower than the <br/>
other system that had 256, but since both systems have been upgraded to <br/>
512mb mem, there is once again no noticeable diffrence between the 2 <br/>
systems, even on 1024x760 high res with all the luclin models selected the <br/>
geforce 1 system performs the same as the ge-force2 system. so maybe u <br/>
should try some more mem.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [EverQuest] gforce 2<br/>
&gt;Date: Mon, 11 Mar 2002 09:29:33 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have an Nvidia tnt2 64 graphics card. PCI. I have seen the gforce 2<br/>
&gt;for about $45. I am wondering if I can expect much improved<br/>
&gt;performance with the gforce 2. Both are pci, both 32k. I get lots of<br/>
&gt;lag in Rivervale, most of Luclin, and some of the other cities. Not<br/>
&gt;everywhere, just where lots of people gather and the backgrounds are<br/>
&gt;graphics intensive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t have the money to go for the gforce 3, and I don&#39;t even know<br/>
&gt;if the 3 comes in pci format. I need another hard disk as well as<br/>
&gt;doing a graphics upgrade, so the money needs to stay around that $45.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would want a very obvious improvement to even bother with the<br/>
&gt;upgrade on the graphics.<br/>
