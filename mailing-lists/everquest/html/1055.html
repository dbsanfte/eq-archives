<div id="ygrps-yiv-547322422">There are 3 goblin camps that I know of in BB.  First one if you are coming<br/>
from Gfay run till you get to the buildings (the 2 with vendors) and take a<br/>
right after the first building and just go straight out there is one there.<br/>
Goblin Wizards can spawn here and can kill you pretty fast if your not<br/>
careful.<br/>
<br/>
Second one when you come to the next building after the one mentioned before<br/>
this (called the cross roads on my server, 2 guards and one dwarf in silver<br/>
plate Nyzil Xxxxxxxx) go straight past this building and the road will curve<br/>
around to the left and you will see the goblin huts off to the right after a<br/>
short distance on this trail.<br/>
<br/>
Third one is when you come to the cross roads guard shack, coming from gfay,<br/>
take a right when you get the next guard shack take a left right off the<br/>
trail and you will come to another goblin camp (goblin warriors, no wizards<br/>
here).  <br/>
<br/>
On a side note if you go past the goblin warrior camp you will come to a<br/>
bandit camp, careful here as the lvl range is large and they have a pretty<br/>
large argo range for their lvl.  I think they can go from 9 to 14 (peg leg<br/>
is 14 or so).  Spawn is pretty fast.  1 roamer here spawns on the wall<br/>
across from the camp and can argo the camp when he runs out to get you.  His<br/>
name, Qued ( I think).  He is my arch nemesis.  I hate this guy and I think<br/>
to this day he is still responsible for the majority of my deaths.  I cant<br/>
count the number of times I was fighting a goblin or a bat or something and<br/>
this SOB came up and started backstabbing me with his fists.  I am sure I<br/>
died at least 30 times to this guy.<br/>
<br/>
Rambled long enough.<br/>

6 more days to eq<br/>
