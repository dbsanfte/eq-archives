<div id="ygrps-yiv-286190051"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   Ok I have to step in here for a moment.  First of all anyone who plays<br/>
 </span></blockquote>alot of games on a computer will notice most games come with a &gt;cd-key  and<br/>
they codes are all different.  Second of all how can you lose a jewel case<br/>
but not the cd that came in it?  I have used many cd &gt;games and have not<br/>
once lost the cd key for the game and I keep a record of my cd keys in case<br/>
the key becomes faded to the point i can &gt;now longer read it.  i.e: my<br/>
diabvlo 2 cd key the key is so faded i no longer can read it.  Well that<br/>
just my 2 cents.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, lets just assume the person is new to computer games or thought this<br/>
one worked differently.<br/>
It&#39;s easy to lose the case if you keep the CD out to put in the computer or<br/>
you put it in a different place. I often lose my CD cases without losing the<br/>
CDs. and I often lose CDs but still find the cases.. Or I lose both<br/>
altogether. Some of us are just not that organized.<br/>
Give people the benefit of the doubt.<br/>
Go play and have fun. :-)<br/>
