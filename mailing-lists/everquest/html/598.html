<div id="ygrps-yiv-553089007">Get rid of the level cap.  They have already build in caps into the damage<br/>
and item will do at different level.  As for the No Drop think about this I<br/>
have a cleric. I get the follow a Bloodforge Hammer, a Screaming Mace and a<br/>
Shining Star of Life all of which I love to but for different Mobs. So if<br/>
you make them No Drop what do I do Carry them around with me all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Another Import thing what if you DIE no one can loot your No Drop items from<br/>
your body for you.</div>
