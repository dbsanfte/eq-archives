<div id="ygrps-yiv-205566274">It&#39;s possible that you do not have good enough PoK faction for these NPCs to<br/>
continue and actually offer you a quest. A possible solution is the &quot;sewing<br/>
needles for Willamina&quot; quest. Talk to Willamina (loc neg 415, pos 1160), and<br/>
she sends you off on a Fed Ex quest involving 9 other NPCs, all in PoK.<br/>
<br/>
You finally get a book from her that, in addition to some minor stats, also<br/>
contains something called a &quot;faction modifier&quot;, which I am assuming modifies<br/>
PoK faction to the point that others will give you quests, i.e. continue<br/>
their conversations further.<br/>
<br/>
I have written down the names and locs of all the NPCs, if you want them.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Plane of Knowledge NPC&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have been exploring the pok for my last two sessions. Had a bit of<br/>
&gt; a break between sessions due to having no power for most of a week.<br/>
&gt; Quite a storm here in the Central Coast district of California.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In talking with many NPC&#39;s I found them giving me about a paragraph<br/>
&gt; of monologue, breaking at a point which indicates more to come.<br/>
&gt; However, few have the &quot;continue&quot; command attached. Anyone know how to<br/>
&gt; get the whole monologue from these NPC&#39;s?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tried increasing the size of my dialogue box, but had no success.<br/>
&gt; Now I did have two boxes open, side by side, and only tried adding<br/>
&gt; length to the box in which the NPC&#39;s were talking. I may try a wider,<br/>
&gt; longer box next time. Anyone have any experience in pok with this<br/>
&gt; problem?<br/>
