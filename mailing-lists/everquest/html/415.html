<div id="ygrps-yiv-19918249">I think someone has brought this up before, but I figured I would bring it<br/>
up again. Lately when I have been hunting in a group we have been using the<br/>
one person loot method. This is where one person turns off autosplit and<br/>
loots all the kills, and offers any items found on the body to the group.<br/>
Whoever wants the items gets it if it is OK with the group. You can ask for<br/>
the item weather you can use it or you think you can get more for it selling<br/>
it to PC&#39;s rather than selling it to a merchant. Or we can try to sell it in<br/>
auction while we are hunting. Usually I have been the one doing the looting<br/>
in the groups that I have been in, because I have the level 19 Druid Ring<br/>
spells, which are awesome. If no one wants the item, or wants to sell it to<br/>
a PC, I hold on to it. When I get overloaded I use one of my ring spells to<br/>
take me RIGHT to a merchant. And it just so happens that this merchant is<br/>
also a Druid, so I get a little better price when selling items. Then I just<br/>
gate back to where my party is and do some more hunting. This sell time<br/>
takes about 3 to 4 min, it is awesome. This continues until someone is ready<br/>
to leave the group. Once someone needs to leave the group, I do one more<br/>
final sell run, then come back and use the /split command to split the<br/>
coins. I first try to make change for the PP and the Gold if it is not a<br/>
number that can be divided by the number of people in the group. I am not<br/>
sure if everyone knows this, but even if you have Autosplit turned on, and<br/>
there is six people in your party, if the MOB has 5P 5G 5S 6C, the looter<br/>
gets 5P 5G 5S 1C. The other party members get 1C each. The computer will not<br/>
make change. That is why the one looter method works so well.<br/>
<br/>
But I have an even better way to do it, this works better if the entire<br/>
party are all members of the same guild or are good friends. You plan a<br/>
hunting trip, make sure everyone goes to the bank and deposits of all their<br/>
coins. (You really do not have to do this, you can take note of what coins<br/>
you currently have and then subtract those numbers from the new numbers at<br/>
the end of the hunting trip. It is just a whole lot easier if you have zero<br/>
from the start.)  This way everyone can loot, and can have Autosplit on or<br/>
off, makes no difference. When an item is found it is offered to the group,<br/>
if no one wants it, it is sold. Then when the party gets overloaded with<br/>
&quot;JUNK&quot; they can go sell, or if they have a level 19 or higher Druid in the<br/>
party with a Ring spell, give all the junk to him, he gates to go sell and<br/>
then gates back to hunt some more! At the end of the hunting trip, or if<br/>
someone must leave, everyone gives all their coins, or the coins that they<br/>
did not start with to one person and that person makes change where needed<br/>
(this is not hard to do if you are in a crowded zone, someone is always<br/>
looking to get bigger coins for smaller ones, coin weight adds up). Then<br/>
uses the /split command. Everybody wins in either one of these loot plans.<br/>
The only problem is finding someone to party with that you can trust. Trust<br/>
is earned not given, and I can understand that..... just a few ideas on<br/>
looting!<br/>
