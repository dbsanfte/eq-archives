<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074870397">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to read this post. I&#39;m working on a new <br/>
show for VH1 entitled &quot;My Obsession&quot; It focuses on pop-culture and <br/>
it&#39;s effects on society, people, etc.  We are working on a segment <br/>
that highlights people submerged in the world of Everquest, and I&#39;m <br/>
looking for possible candidates for the show.  Our ideal person would <br/>
be someone who plays the game continuously/excessively and has <br/>
encountered problems be it family or friends due to their EQ habits.<br/>
<br/>
Side note: This is not meant to be an Everquest &quot;bashing&quot;<br/>
story as so many from the past have been.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
