Subject: [EverQuest] New to online Gaming<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; Having been a fan of computer RPG&#39;s for years I am considering trying<br/>
&gt; EQ. Having never played an online rpg before I have a few questions ?<br/>
&gt; (Forgive my lack of knowledge and feel free to laugh at my questions)<br/>
&gt; 1. Being used to playing solo games I could pretty much play at my<br/>
&gt; own pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other online players but<br/>
&gt; seeing as I am a casual gamer i only spend  10-15 hours a week gaming<br/>
&gt; is this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play occurs with whoever<br/>
&gt; is online at the time and am I not tied into a specific group/times.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes you can play as much as you want..........you are noe tied down to<br/>
specific groups or times unless you want to be. But watch out it is know as<br/>
evercrack for a reason.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join with?<br/>
<br/>
Yes it is very easy to fine other peeps to play with.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kharnak, etc) does it<br/>
&gt; matter which one I start with or are the later addons geared for<br/>
&gt; higher level characters.<br/>
<br/>
MY recomendation is to get the trilogy it gives you the three old world game<br/>
and expansions and also get the luclin expansion, it will save a lot of<br/>
headaces later on, all of the expansions are geared for all levels and style<br/>
of play, just the new one coming out in october will be gared for the higher<br/>
lvls.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the system requirements<br/>
&gt; but what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866, 128sdram, 32mb ddr nvidia<br/>
&gt; geforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or should I wait<br/>
&gt; till I upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
The speed and cpu are fine but I highly recomend upgrading the memory to 512<br/>
mb or the highest you motherboard can hold, the graphics card and modem will<br/>
work till you upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any feedback<br/>
&gt;<br/>
