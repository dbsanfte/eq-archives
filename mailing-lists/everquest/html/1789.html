Spec are great exp and great loot. The loot use to be better in the older<br/>
days. Specs use to drop the Box of Al&#39;kabor which is a 10 slot box, 100%<br/>
weight reduction. The box is lore, so you only could own one, people use to<br/>
give them away for free. Specs also drop Black Pearls. A long time ago,<br/>
Black Pearls were worth 100 platinum or so, but now on my server, they&#39;re<br/>
not worth much, I just sell mine to the vender for like 9 plat I think.<br/>
Still today Specs drop weapons called Sythes but the weapon can be of 3<br/>
different varieties, rusted Sythes, bronze Sythes and just Sythes. Destroy<br/>
the rusty, sell the bronze for 5 plat and the best ones, just regular Sythes<br/>
sell for like 13 plat. I can remember making 1k in plat here. You really<br/>
need to get a mage to summon you a couple 100% weight reduction bags. If you<br/>
are hunting the Specs in Oasis and you can pull singles off the island,<br/>
there are many spots just off the island that are bugged, when you fear the<br/>
Spec, it gets stuck. Even if you do not run across one of these spots, the<br/>
Specs run so slow, it is almost like they are snared already. I do not think<br/>
a level 35 cleric could solo one, they would run out of mana with the spec<br/>
still at 30 - 40 % life still left. But a good 3 man team level 35 - 40<br/>
should do great here and make some decent platinum. <br/>
<br/>
Before the last patch, a level 1 character could make 100 platinum an hour,<br/>
but Verant has fixed this. People were making this plat by cooking Fish<br/>
Rolls, combining bat wings with fresh fish. I think this was trivial at a<br/>
skill of 130ish. I&#39;m not sure what the venders were buying the Fish Rolls<br/>
for, but it must have been fairly good for Verant to fix it. I still make<br/>
Fish Rolls for my characters and guildmates. A stack of 20 Fish Rolls can<br/>
last you a long time. The meal size on Fish Rolls is banquet and they last a<br/>
LONG time.  <br/>

	Yeah... I&#39;d say you&#39;d get slaughtered~~~  heh.  they con blue or <br/>
	yellow at 34+ plus I don&#39;t think they give that much money anyway.  <br/>
	And you need good magic resist cuz they can fear you.  As for you <br/>
	clerics, you just need a good group to kill these things.  I don&#39;t <br/>
	know many clerics who solo anyway if that&#39;s waht you were thinking <br/>
	(those that are clerics anyway).  I&#39;m sure you can do it at 35+ <br/>
	though if you got a good group.<br/>
