<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260169397">Hi all, <br/>
   As I have read the boards over the last couple of weeks, I can&#39;t <br/>
help but get the feeling that I am the old man of this group. I have <br/>
been playing EQ since the beginning, and have a vast knowledge of the <br/>
game. I current have 3 characters, a 65 Ranger, a 48 Necro, and a 44 <br/>
Rogue. I have, however, played every class into the 30&#39;s, just to get <br/>
a feel for how each class works. Please feel free to ask me any <br/>
questions =) I check the boards once every three days, and will try <br/>
to answer any questions I can =)<br/>
