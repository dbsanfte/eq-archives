<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hi gang,<br/>
&gt; I just wanted to take a moment and thank any and all of you on this list<br/>
&gt; I may have come across during my Warrior&#39;s, (Genmay), travels to and<br/>
&gt; from Ak&#39;Anon and Felwith. The SOW&#39;s were perfect, it makes the trips so<br/>
&gt; much faster! As for the extra buffs those were wonderful too! Lately<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had a thing going on with a large plagued rat over in Steamfront<br/>
&gt; who seems to find me every time and kills me! With the buffs I can make<br/>
&gt; it to the gates of the city and the guards take care of him. I swear<br/>
&gt; when I get a couple of levels higher I&#39;m going to defeat that darn rat!<br/>
&gt; ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Happy hunting!<br/>
&gt; Durgaa: 9th level Wood Elf Ranger<br/>
&gt; Shizney: 5th level Gnome Mage<br/>
&gt; Genmay: 6th level Gnome Warrior<br/>
