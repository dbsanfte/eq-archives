Warrior Genmay, I had just hit lvl13, got my dual weild skill, and was<br/>
hunting Minos in Ak&#39;Anon. Well I go in and pull what I think is just one out<br/>
of the cave but in all reality is actually four slavers! I change to one of<br/>
the wide views and realize my delima. Figuring that I would probably die<br/>
before I got to the guard and even then he wouldn&#39;t be much help I decide to<br/>
pull up my boots and lay into them and at least try to do as much damage as<br/>
possible. I changed from my two Mino battle axes to my Graoning Mace to give<br/>
me a little better chance of taking at least one, maybe two slavers out<br/>
before I die. So far i&#39;m doing pretty good! I&#39;ve killed one and really<br/>
wailing on another when I get attacked by a stupid giant infected rat! &quot;Oh<br/>
great!&quot; I thought figuring my fate was sealed. I ignore the rat and keep<br/>
wailing on the Minos. Luckily somone was nice enough to come by and kill the<br/>
rat for me. By this time I was down to one bub!<br/>
&gt; ble of life left and still two Minos to go. I finish off the one I&#39;ve been<br/>
working on and go right after the last one. &quot;I&#39;m dead so I might as well die<br/>
with my boots on!&quot; I thought, Well suddenly the mino takes off and starts<br/>
running away! &quot;Holy cow! I might make this!&quot; I take off after him and<br/>
finally kill him.<br/>
&gt; So now I&#39;m standing there with a smidgen of a bubble left for life, 4 dead<br/>
mino slavers and a giant diseased rat at my feet. &quot;I have just taken out 4<br/>
mino slavers! RRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&quot; I yell. That felt so good!<br/>
