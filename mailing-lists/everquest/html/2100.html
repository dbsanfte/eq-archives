&gt; Unfortunately, that max is 256. I would love to go<br/>
&gt; to 512 or more, <br/>
&gt; but that would require a new system.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Things have improved with the added memory, but I<br/>
&gt; still get lots of <br/>
&gt; lag in Rivervale, and similar town type zones. My<br/>
&gt; graphics card is an <br/>
&gt; Nvidia TNT 64 (don&#39;t know what the 64 means, it is<br/>
&gt; 32meg). It is the <br/>
&gt; best I could find last year for the money I had, and<br/>
&gt; more than <br/>
&gt; adequate for the game at that time. I needed pci, so<br/>
&gt; my choices were <br/>
&gt; a bit limited. More than that, my knowledge was much<br/>
&gt; less in those <br/>
&gt; days.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am curious as to what kinds of graphics cards<br/>
&gt; people use, and <br/>
&gt; whether or not they are experiencing lag in zones<br/>
&gt; like Rivervale in <br/>
&gt; spite of having a pretty good system.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone have a killer rig, and still find lag or<br/>
&gt; other problems? I <br/>
&gt; just wonder how much is the game, how much my now<br/>
&gt; low end system.<br/>
