<div id="ygrps-yiv-774915533">You can buy and sell in Freeport if you sneak up behind the merchants and<br/>
stay in sneak mode. Then you right click on them or hit U. If you are not<br/>
KOS to them you can sell.<br/>
Yeah, there is a whole underground area of SK and necro and evil races<br/>
trainers and stuff down there. Gotta be careful. If you want to work on your<br/>
faction, kill Deathfist Pawns. Turn in 4 picks to Tashan Hallard in<br/>
Hallard&#39;s Resales in East Fp. It gets you good faction. If you have good<br/>
enough faction to go down to the rogue guild guy (I think there&#39;s the<br/>
counterparts to Janem and Rebby-- who are by the monk guild in West<br/>
Freeport). There is a note deliver quest you can do that gets you good<br/>
faction with them.<br/>
