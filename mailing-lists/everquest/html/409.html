<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695702427">Here are the stats on a set of woven armor, with AC and weight:<br/>
<br/>
Woven cap, 3,  .2<br/>
Woven choker, 2, .1<br/>
Woven veil, 2, .1<br/>
Woven wristband,  2, .2<br/>
Woven gloves, 3, .3<br/>
Woven sleeves, 3, .3<br/>
Woven mantle, 2, .2<br/>
Woven shirt, 6, .5<br/>
Woven cape, 3, .4<br/>
Woven cord, 2, .1<br/>
Woven pants, 4, .4<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, woven armor has the same AC as patchwork, for<br/>
a fraction of the weight and can be used by all races and classes.<br/>
What is not immediately apparent is that woven armor provides a<br/>
&quot;damage absorbtion&quot; similar to leather armor, i.e. you will take less<br/>
damage per hit than if you had the same AC of patchwork armor.<br/>
<br/>
Woven armor can be found both in the Innothule Swamp, and in<br/>
the dungeon of Guk. In the swamp it is carried by froglok foragers<br/>
(levels 6-8) and kobold hunters (7-9). Within Guk it is carried by<br/>
a large assortment of creatures, the weakest being the Froglok<br/>
Apprentice ( levels 6-8 ).<br/>
<br/>
The swamp is fairly easy to pick up armor in, the foragers and<br/>
hunters usually patrol the swamp edge between Jojungua&#39;s<br/>
tower and the entrance to South Ro. Collecting armor off them can<br/>
be extremely frustrating as only around 1 in 10 actually load any.<br/>
Things to look out for while hunting here - Jojongua ( a very powerful<br/>
kobold ), Nynuga ( a deadly troll NPC ),  Zimbittle ( a high level troll<br/>
shaman ), troll slayers, and the troll slayer captain. Be warned<br/>
that of all of these, the only one with an accurate con is Jojo. The<br/>
slayer captain is exceptionally deadly.<br/>
<br/>
NPC trolls can usually be spotted from player trolls by the fact that<br/>
NPC&#39;s are the only one who are not constantly running. Also a<br/>
troll moving a warp speed is also probably an NPC ( they make<br/>
up for walking around most of the time by running insanely fast<br/>
when they spot something to kill )<br/>
<br/>
Be warned that Guk is incredibly dangerous, being particularly<br/>
susceptible to swarms of frogloks. All the frogloks will flee around<br/>
40% health and swiftly fetch powerful reinforcements, there are<br/>
several chokepoints, most notably an exceptionally narrow wooden<br/>
bridge that runs at several odd angles.<br/>
<br/>
If a froglok escapes you it is usually safer to zone, unless you are a<br/>
level 20+ party. The lone froglok might come back with 2 froglok sentrys,<br/>
and then again it might come back with a witchdoctor and 4 Ton Knights.<br/>
<br/>
Most &lt;20 parties pick a room and camp it, sending a runner to draw<br/>
things to them, and ensuring they have plenty of space to chase down<br/>
any runners. A lot of people choose the entrance room for this, for<br/>
obvious reasons.<br/>

Or, suggest a website with information about it?<br/>
<br/>
Is it something that is made, found or purchased?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much,<br/>
