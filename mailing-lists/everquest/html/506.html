You mean under the ice, wheras you take the small hole in the ice then swim <br/>
for it? Which direction? I would like to go check that out sometime. Do you <br/>
think that the cave will become a new zone area, or just a cave under the <br/>
water? And the Necro you say you saw, was he an NPC PK or just a normal NPC? <br/>
Did he scrowl at you?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anyone been to the hidden cave area located in Everfrost.� You have to<br/>
&gt;swim under the ice to get to it ( you must have atleast the skill of 75 in<br/>
&gt;swimming�or Endure Beathing make it).� None of the maps that ive seen,<br/>
&gt;include this area.� I&#39;ve traveled there before and i found� the maze�to be<br/>
&gt;mostly empty, shy a few ice boned skeletons.� There was a named human<br/>
&gt;necromancer there, but�i have since forgotten his name.� I cannot verfiy<br/>
&gt;that the cave was empty after that, for i didn&#39;t explore beyond the Necro.�<br/>
&gt;I do believe that the cave extended further; though, i cannot verfiy.� <br/>
&gt;There<br/>
&gt;was also a small portal like structure that was guarded by two ice bones.�<br/>
&gt;If you step inside you are turned back around, (like the skeleton cave in<br/>
&gt;the Tox Forest, which will soon lead to the future�Paineel zone) i asume<br/>
&gt;that this aswell will be a future zone point.�<br/>
&gt;�<br/>
&gt;I will check it out again and report in.� Check it out, who knows what<br/>
&gt;purpose or loot the necro might contain.� Maybe hes guarding something<br/>
&gt;else..<br/>
