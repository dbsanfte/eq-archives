<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426280184">Greetings!  I am new to this mailing list so I thought I would give a word<br/>
or many of introduction.  At this point I would introduce myself as my main,<br/>
but since I&#39;m still undecided as to who my main actually is, I will tell you<br/>
about my characters and how this all began.<br/>
<br/>
I started playing EverQuest a little over a year ago.  The first character I<br/>
ever created was a half elf rogue by the name of Wulfric Rennison who is<br/>
currently level 31.  Since Wulfric I have created a druid who originally<br/>
started out as a half elf until I realized druids are wisdom based casters<br/>
and half elves don&#39;t have much wisdom.  So I deleted the druid at level 15<br/>
and recreated him as a wood elf.  His name is Raido Covenfall.  Currently he<br/>
is level 40.  Wulfric and Raido are really my two mains, though Wulfric<br/>
doesn&#39;t get played much.  I mainly use Raido to earn plat to buy better gear<br/>
for Wulfric.  Then my two lesser characters are Celric Feldrak (an anagram<br/>
for &quot;dark elf cleric&quot; in case you didn&#39;t catch it) a level 20 currently<br/>
working on faction in Qeynos for the Testament of Vanear quest, and Savawulf<br/>
Tageric (a combination of two words - Savatage and Wulfric.  Savatage being<br/>
my favorite band and Wulfric you already know.  Wulfric incidentally is made<br/>
of two words &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;reich&quot;.).  Those are all on the Cazic Thule server.<br/>
If you see one of them sometime, feel free to send a tell.  Then I have<br/>
various characters on other servers, the primary ones being Kenjite Arimasen<br/>
(in Japanese means &quot;There are no forbidden subjects&quot;), currently a level 18<br/>
wood elf druid, and Petrus Steelsinger (so named for Peter Steele, front man<br/>
for the band Type O Negative), who, of course, is a bard half elf, currently<br/>
level 11 and rarely played.<br/>
<br/>
All of these characters are in various guilds.  Raido and Celric are both<br/>
tagged in the guild &quot;Amicus Concordiam&quot;.   Wulfric and Savawulf are tagged<br/>
to the guild &quot;Draconis Rampant&quot;.  Kenjite and Petrus are tagged to the guild<br/>
&quot;Bane of Tunare&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have many friends who play online, and I am also responsible for getting<br/>
several people addicted.  I love the game, I don&#39;t plan on quitting any time<br/>
soon, and I believe that if I ever get married, my wife will have to be an<br/>
EQ addict as well!  Oh yeah... and she has to like cartoons and kung fu<br/>
movies... but that&#39;s neither here nor there.<br/>
<br/>
And for what it&#39;s worth... I don&#39;t really have a life outside of EQ.  :b<br/>
<br/>
See you online!!<br/>
Send me a tell!<br/>
