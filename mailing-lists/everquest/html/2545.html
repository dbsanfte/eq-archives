<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266393749"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; As a result of me quitting EQ I have handed over the ownership of this<br/>
&gt; mailing list to Su, she seems like a reasonable person to carry on, even<br/>
&gt; tho there isn&#39;t really much this list has required in the ways of<br/>
&gt; maintenance.. I have barely done jack here since I started it back<br/>
&gt; during beta.. :p However i did restrict access to the calendar now and<br/>
&gt; removed that annoying spam event thing hehe...<br/>
&gt; Good luck everyone!<br/>

And hello everybody. No, don&#39;t back away. I won&#39;t eat you. What? What<br/>
clever? Oh that, it&#39;s just... uhh.. it&#39;s rubber. Not real. heh. Why is<br/>
