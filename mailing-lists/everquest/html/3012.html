 </span></blockquote>I play on TP sometimes as well.  Look for a group of 4 or 5 Trolls on <br/>
Sunday afternoons, that&#39;s us.  We are an awesome sight!  We&#39;re too <br/>
small to be our own guild and too casual for most other guilds.  But <br/>
we do share resources, including our alts, so we do well.  <br/>
<br/>
My alt is an Inky Necro that just finished the newbie armor quests.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, I&#39;m an evil kind of guy on TP.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be ravaging the Lake Rathe zone for a few weeks.  Stop by and <br/>
shout encouraging or derogatory words!</div>
