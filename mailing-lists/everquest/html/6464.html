<b>Subject:</b> Re: Question about some of the new zones <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-218278799">I still group on occasion, it&#39;s not that.  But when in a group, I tend<br/>
to be at the mercy of the group leader, who decides where we go and<br/>
what we do.  Most of the time, they have something specific in mind,<br/>
like a certain drop somewhere, or lots of plat, or uber xp (Like<br/>
Noble&#39;s Causeway).  What I like to do is just go somewhere and<br/>
explore.  I&#39;ve started the Slipgem quest in CC, but to do that solo is<br/>
suicide in the first degree when it comes to some of the higher end<br/>
zones from Depths of Darkhollow, but so far, it&#39;s been fun.  Over the<br/>
past several months, I&#39;ve made it a point to go to zones I&#39;ve never<br/>
been to and try my hand at playing there.  To me, that&#39;s more fun than<br/>
grinding out xp in a plat hungry group (which I tend to find more<br/>
often than not).  <br/>
<br/>
I have been in a couple of guilds (I&#39;m on the Povar server), one of<br/>
which was run by an immature, clueless person, and one that just<br/>
didn&#39;t have the membership to support higher end groupage.  I have a<br/>
core group of people I met in my first guild, but with the invent of<br/>
monster missions, they have chosen to chain play those, which is<br/>
boring to me.  I&#39;ve done a few, but the same one for 8 hours straight?<br/>
 Not me.  Anyway, thanks for the information and I&#39;ll see what I can do.</div>
