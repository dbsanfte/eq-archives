<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111418143">I see your point but I bought a machine for 600.00 a<br/>
few months ago and it runs EQ fine.<br/>
<br/>
It is only a 1.2 Celeron with 300 and change RAM with<br/>
a 64 mb video card. I can play EQ and a First person<br/>
shooter with no hesitation at all.<br/>
<br/>
Granted the bazaar gets a little laggy but everything<br/>
else is great.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, an UBHA machine would be great but you can do<br/>
with much less.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I very much enjoy PC gaming. I also like to play on<br/>
&gt; consoles. I find <br/>
&gt; the style of game play is quite different in each<br/>
&gt; medium.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ultimately the consoles prove the easiest and least<br/>
&gt; expensive to buy <br/>
&gt; and upgrade. Generally a console and two games,<br/>
&gt; maybe a few more <br/>
&gt; items, can be had for $300.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is hard to put a decent pc together for gaming<br/>
&gt; for under $1000. <br/>
&gt; About double that will net a decent machine with<br/>
&gt; upgrade potential, <br/>
&gt; but without the need to upgrade for some time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The upper end of pc gaming runs around $8000. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Obviously, more people can buy in for $300 than for<br/>
&gt; the $1000 plus.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Part of me wants to be a pc hotrodder, and build an<br/>
&gt; ubermachine. Big, <br/>
&gt; bad, and hot. With adequate cooling, as well. That<br/>
&gt; part of me does <br/>
&gt; not have access to the purse. Sadly, real life<br/>
&gt; expenses have first <br/>
&gt; claim on my wallet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I am watching the trends, and encouraging myself<br/>
&gt; to adopt the <br/>
&gt; philosophy that I am a gamer, and the platform is<br/>
&gt; less important than <br/>
&gt; the experience. It is within the scope of<br/>
&gt; possibility, and probably <br/>
&gt; in the path of great profitability for the makers,<br/>
&gt; that console <br/>
&gt; online multiplayer games will be of such game<br/>
&gt; quality in the future <br/>
&gt; that holding onto the pc platform will be only an<br/>
&gt; option, and not a <br/>
&gt; necessity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Alternately, I can see online game manufacturers<br/>
&gt; selling systems to <br/>
&gt; insure their audience is there. Wouldn&#39;t that be<br/>
&gt; grand? Order the <br/>
&gt; game and the system all for one monthly payment.<br/>
&gt; Upgrade components <br/>
&gt; will be shipped when software demands require it.<br/>
&gt; Your system will <br/>
&gt; always be current.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What will the future hold? I don&#39;t know, but I am<br/>
&gt; sure I cannot be <br/>
&gt; shelling out several thousand dollars every other<br/>
&gt; year. The cost has <br/>
&gt; to be brought in line with the spending capacity of<br/>
&gt; a large audience, <br/>
&gt; or else the hobby will suffer decline.<br/>
