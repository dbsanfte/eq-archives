<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One thing I&#39;ve noticed is people usually call camp checks if they plan to<br/>
&gt; camp a particular mob or they plan to do something that could effect the<br/>
&gt; mobs in the zone aside from a few.  Hollowshade is one example, there are<br/>
&gt; mobs that people farm for substances to smith, however those same mobs can<br/>
&gt; be replaced by new mobs that don&#39;t have the substances they want by just a<br/>
&gt; few kills in one area.  Usually if i was planning  on hunting a pertucular<br/>
&gt; mob that can be effected as such...i usually ask what camps anyone has to<br/>
&gt; make sure i&#39;m not going to interfer with them, but if noone replys what<br/>
