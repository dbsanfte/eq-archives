<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633248528">I subscribed to Everquest for a while, but had to cancel because I <br/>
didn&#39;t have enough money to continue. <br/>
<br/>
After I cancelled my subscription, I continued to get charged for 6 <br/>
months afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I should let people know what they&#39;re dealing with.</div>
