PM<br>Subject: [EverQuest] some encouragement for a humble 
newb<br><br><br>Hi<br>As a newb, its hard not to feel a little intimidated by 
the <br>discussions here. I am in AWE of you people even though I don&#39;t 
<br>understand half of what you say. I long for the day when I can talk 
<br>about the finer ponts of EQ like you guys. <br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; That won&#39;t be too long. Even 
though the zones might be different, the mobs are pretty much the same.&nbsp; 
Once you learn how to deal with one mob, it pretty much applies to all 
mobs.&nbsp; A little trepidation and common sense.&nbsp; Con before you 
attack.&nbsp; If it&#39;s red, stay away from it.&nbsp; If you&#39;re in a zone and 
EVERYTHING is red, invisible is a good thing.&nbsp; You never know just which 
mobs will aggro, and what idiot will traint he zone just for fun.&nbsp; Next 
thing you know you&#39;re caught in the crossfire of soemthign you didn&#39;t start and 
die for no reason whatsoever.&nbsp; That sucks!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><br>For the moment I have a love/hate relationship with EQ after playing 
<br>for about two months or so. Its a type of game I have never <br>experienced 
before - I am totally fascinated and mildly (well, at the <br>moment!) addicted. 
The game boths thrills and scares me. I find <br>myself nervously approaching 
the PC every night mentally preparing <br>myself for the dangers ahead. Once I&#39;m 
in, I am immersed. GET THAT <br>LEVEL UP is my only goal.<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; I was the same way when I started out.&nbsp; But EQ 
 </div></span></blockquote>has gone through a lot of changes since I started.&nbsp; Now it&#39;s a heck of a 
lot easier than it was before.&nbsp; Not because I&#39;m experience but just because 
they&#39;ve made so many changes that now it&#39;s just easier for newbies.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>When I levelled 10 I knew that I was going to have to deal with REAL 
<br>dying and corpse retrieval. Boy, that was - and still is&nbsp; - a 
<br>learning experience. The first few times I got so depressed that I <br>vowed 
to give up and cancel my subscription. But I crawled to lvl 11 <br>and am much 
more careful about conning.<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; The better you know a zone, the easier it is 
 </div></span></blockquote>to retrieve a corpse.&nbsp; 3 words:&nbsp;&nbsp; eqatlas.com
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>By nature I am not a team player so grouping is still a bit alien to 
<br>me although I realise its the only fast way to get xp. But too often <br>I 
find myself in groups that just gung ho for everything in sight <br>hitting 
anything that moves (= Excelsis having to retrive his corpse <br>ONCE more in 
some weird, out of the way loc).<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; Each character has very defined roles in terms of 
 </div></span></blockquote>grouping.&nbsp; How you solo is up to you but there are strategies and tactics 
to make it more effective.&nbsp; But in my experience, when you&#39;re in a group, 
people expect you to play a certain way, and those that don&#39;t, get kicked from 
the group.&nbsp; For example, you very rarely see a melee druid in a 
group.&nbsp; Unfortunately, druids are expected to just sit there and cast - 
buffs, heals, nukes, DOTs, whatever.&nbsp; Therefore, it&#39;s very hard for a druid 
to raise melee skills.&nbsp; What&#39;s the point of having 1HB and 1HS if you never 
have to use it?&nbsp;&nbsp; The sooner you learn your role in a group, the 
easier it&#39;ll be to group in a long run.&nbsp; The best groups are the ones where 
everybody knows what their job is.&nbsp; You can amass great amounts of xp in 
short periods of time in groups like that.&nbsp; You can even go up several 
levels in a few hours.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>Can I ask you guys some questions? I reckon a 1/5 bub a night is 
<br>pretty average to aim for. That would lvl me up once a week. Is that <br>the 
norm? How long did it take you in the beginning?<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; On my own I can do levels 1- 10 in one night.&nbsp; 
 </div></span></blockquote>Being power leveled I can do it in less than 3 hours.&nbsp; At level 12 I 
reccomend going to Paludal Caverns on Luclin.&nbsp; I leveled 12-20 in 4 hours 
being PL&#39;d by a 52 druid.&nbsp; After level 20 xp will slow down somewhat.&nbsp; 
You might be able to gain one level in a night, two if you&#39;re rockin.&nbsp; 
Otherwise be happy with 2 yellows if you get it.&nbsp; After level 40 xp moves 
much slower.&nbsp; It took me awhile to go from 45-47.&nbsp; At 50+ you&#39;ll 
probably be working on AA points so xp will creep.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>I have tried to solo in Black Burrow but that is well nigh impossible 
<br>on your own. Grouping is the only way but I HATE that place so much <br>it 
makes me so nervous to go there. I am soloing in West Kerana but <br>grizzly and 
giant spider spawns are pretty rare so I spend a lot of <br>time hanging around 
and trying to avoid the bandits (by the way, they <br>seem to be walking all 
over WK recently,&nbsp; not just around their huts. <br>Is this new?)<br></div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; Get a port to West Commons&nbsp;and hunt 
 </div></span></blockquote>there.&nbsp; Or go to Paludal. &nbsp; XP will move faster.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>Any advice and encouragement you can give me is greatly appreciated. 
<br>I know I&#39;m not alone, but sometimes it feels as though I am! I use <br>the 
English server Venril Sathir (I live in Amsterdam) and sometimes <br>the zones 
are completely deserted. Is it like that on the US servers <br>as 
well?<br></div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Depends ont he time of day.&nbsp; I&#39;ve played various 
 </div></span></blockquote>servers and it really depends on the time.&nbsp; On Cazic Thule server that I 
normally play on, prime time seems to be after midnight EST.&nbsp; In the 
afternoons though, it&#39;s pretty empty.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>Hope to hear from some of you anyway, especially your experiences and 
<br>feelings about EQ when you first started. I&#39;m off again now to that <br>HUGE 
VAST world that we all know and love (and sometimes hate...)<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; Curiously enough when I started, I was deathly 
 </div></span></blockquote>afraid of East Commons.&nbsp; I died once and couldn&#39;t fnd my corpse.&nbsp; 
Someone asked me where I was, I said there were tons of orcs around.&nbsp; I had 
died at orc 2 but I didn&#39;t know it at the time.&nbsp; I was only level 5.&nbsp; 
Now, I know the zone like the back of my own hand and I can&#39;t get lost no matter 
how hard I try.&nbsp; I don&#39;t even bother doing a loc any more when I die.&nbsp; 
East Commons is home for me.&nbsp;
