<div id="ygrps-yiv-283282820">Hi and welcome to the world of EQ.  Ok to link a wep all you do is go in<br/>
your inventory and bring up your window that has the description of your<br/>
wep.  After that left click (or right click can&#39;t remember) the icon of the<br/>
wep and it should bring up blue text that links the wep.  You&#39;ll learn<br/>
something new everyday playing Everquest.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Lost in translation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for helping me to learn how to create and configure <br/>
spare chat screens. Now someone has thrown me another mystery to solve. A <br/>
player sent me the following words:<br/>
&quot;Link your wep pls?&quot;<br/>
Ok. I figured out that a wep is a weapon. When I asked him what he meant, <br/>
he said that he wanted to link with my hammer. I have an Intel&#39;s Hammer. <br/>
However, I have no idea what he means by linking him to it or how to do it. <br/>
Somebody please throw this poor newbe a clue. G. I&#39;m playing a level 24 vah <br/>
shir shaman. Great goddess, there is something totally new to learn <br/>
everything I log on.<br/>
