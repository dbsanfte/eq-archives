  Hello I am new<br>&gt; <br>This is the main problem I have with both 
  powerleveling and <br>twinking.&nbsp; There are points in the game where your 
  role changes.&nbsp; I <br>have been through 3 of them already.&nbsp; If you 
  don&#39;t play the lower <br>levels of your class you miss a valuable learning 
  experience. <br><br>I&#39;ve heard all of the excuses, it&#39;s boring, I&#39;ve already 
  done it, <br>etc.&nbsp; So, they run an SK up to 30 with PL and 
  Twinking.&nbsp; They <br>figure &quot;I was a Warrior before, now I just have 
  spells too&quot; and then <br>get their party killed because they don&#39;t know how to 
  play the SK <br>properly.&nbsp; But that&#39;s everyone elses fault!&nbsp; Because 
  before their <br>protector buffed them up or twinked them out to the point 
  that the <br>mobs couldn&#39;t hurt them, so why couldn&#39;t the group?&nbsp; Then 
  it&#39;s a TPW, <br>corpse run and the SK is on the /Ignore list!<br><br>I laugh 
  when I see a blueberry run by with a Skeleton chasing them <br>because they 
  can&#39;t hurt it, but it can hurt them.&nbsp; They beg me to <br>help them, silly 
  twink.&nbsp; Go to your well deserved death, I&#39;ll kill <br>them mob when it 
  finishes you.&nbsp; You shouldn&#39;t pick on reds just <br>because your daddy 
  gave you Lambant armor to wear!<br><br>Ok, maybe I&#39;m bitter too! 
  LOL<br><br>But my advice is to enjoy them game and play for every level you 
  <br>get.&nbsp; If some kind soul casts a SoW or other buff on you, thank 
  <br>them.&nbsp; If someone offers you a weapon or armor, thank them.&nbsp; If 
  you <br>beg for these things they may let the Mob kill you, but if your Karma 
  <br>is right they may help.&nbsp; Never expect anything, you&#39;ll never be be 
  <br>disappointed.<br><br>And remember when you see a newbie struggling that 
  you were there <br>once.&nbsp; <br><br>Death to all Twinks! ;)<br><br>Tuldayen
