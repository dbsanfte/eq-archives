thought you said you had a Geforce&nbsp;3? That is much better than a Geforce 4 
MX. I play on 56K and that doesn&#39;t affect lag in the way you are 
describing.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Finally got my card. Got it installed and went for a test 
  drive.<br><br>One area that is a big problem is Rivervale. With the last 
  expansion <br>Rivervale became so laggy that I avoided going home when I 
  could. Now <br>I get a few hiccups when I enter the zone, then it settles down 
  to a <br>playable level. A hitch now and then, but nothing like before the 
  <br>upgrade.<br><br>Checked out a few cities, some zones in between. Made 
  technical <br>adjustments. On the whole quite pleased.<br><br>One thing I 
  noticed was a bit of lag in laggy zones (Luclin was <br>almost unplayable 
  until now)until I had been there a bit. When I went <br>to the Bazaar I just 
  did a slow 360 and the lag went away. Figure <br>enough of the zone loaded 
  into active memory to carry the play from <br>then on. Perhaps someone could 
  explain what was actuall happening to <br>the system when I do this. Anyway, I 
  do a scan of my environment when <br>I zone and things are pretty 
  smooth.<br><br>This is my last upgrade to my present system. Have to replace 
  my <br>tower next, and hope to hold out a while. How much can I spend every 
  <br>year on these things? The family expects me to feed them, and I hate 
  <br>to dissppoint them too often on that account just to play my 
  game.<br><br>Now if DSL comes down a bit in price, I may try that. Could that 
  be <br>the key to absolute smooth-as-butter-on-a-bald-monkey performance on 
  <br>my aging machine? (The thing is just a bit over a year old. How fast 
  <br>they grow old.)<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
