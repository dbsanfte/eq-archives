I went after the orc runner in butcherblock, found him, killed him, took<br/>
his pouch and delivered it to my guild and received exp for it, now when I<br/>
talk to him again he still offers the same quest, isnt it supposed to be<br/>
new quests once you have completed one? Or did I do something wrong? Where<br/>
do I receive the next quests, like the one with DVinn&#39;s heart?<br/>
