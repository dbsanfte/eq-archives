<b>Subject:</b> Re: When to start AAs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928400328">There has been much debate about what level to start aa&#39;s at and at <br/>
what level aa&#39;s seem to move the fastest.  In my experience in EQ I <br/>
tend to get my first 6 aa&#39;s at level 51.  The first 3 I spend on run 3 <br/>
on any class of character that I start.  The next 3,if it is melee I <br/>
spend on regen 3, if a caster I spend on either wisdom or intelligence <br/>
depending upon the class.  Then I level up to level 60 and work my <br/>
aa&#39;s again there.  I have been known to work aa&#39;s up to 100 at level <br/>
60, the aa xp seems to move a little faster at level 60. As an example <br/>
in Sol Ro tower at level 60 you will get an aa about every 8 to 10 <br/>
kills.  I will say again the unrest instancezone off of butcher block <br/>
is great xp. Easy single pulls and you have a chance at a nice upgrade <br/>
at the end. You just have to make sure that your average level is <br/>
within 2 levels of the lowest member of the group.</div>
