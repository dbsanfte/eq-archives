<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-396809246">Actually, I have been PLed a little. I had people come up and offer to PL<br/>
me. I learned what they were capable of and it helped to hone my grouping<br/>
skills. I knew what I had to do as well as what they had to do. I learned my<br/>
limitations. I always try to suggest strategy to anyone I PL. Generally<br/>
PLing is NOT good for a firsttime player. It&#39;s best for when you already<br/>
have a character that has leveled up well. Then you can just level up<br/>
another quickly. I don&#39;t really like it when people ask me to PL them.<br/>
Although when I think about it, my mother has been PLed a bit and she is a<br/>
horrible player. She doesn&#39;t like grouping, doesn&#39;t like sharing loot,<br/>
doesn&#39;t like sharing xp.. And she actually complains that she has to do some<br/>
of the work to kill the mobs when I PL her... sheesh. Sorry, venting there.<br/>
But I got the thing down to less than a quarter of life, atoned it, and she<br/>
was like &quot;you didn&#39;t do enough dmg to it&quot;. But if I did more dmg I&#39;d kill<br/>
it. Some people. Venting again.. sorry.<br/>
luv,<br/>

<br/>
I have been playing for about two years and have never been powerleveled or<br/>
given anything and I still have a ton to learn about the game. I don&#39;t see<br/>
how anyone could possibly be pl&#39;ed and be a good player.<br/>

    Don&#39;t be afraid to ask someone to pl you?? Sorry I do not agree with<br/>
that. Do not ask for pl....do it yourself. Being power leveled makes for bad<br/>
players with low skills. Do it yourself with groups,etc....<br/>
