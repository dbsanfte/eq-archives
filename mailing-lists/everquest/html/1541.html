<div id="ygrps-yiv-946814847">I&#39;ve found that since I attained Breeze, whenever I need SoW (somehow I<br/>
often find myself having to run 1/2 way or even clear across the continent<br/>
to help out a guildmate) all I need do is find a medding Druid.  I&#39;ll Breeze<br/>
him and 9 times out of 10 they&#39;ll stand and SoW me, no questions asked.  For<br/>
that matter, unless I&#39;m in a huge hurry, I usually breeze/buff people I pass<br/>
in my travels.  I figure what goes around, comes around.<br/>

&gt; I will generally ask for a sow in /ooc or /shout (shout only if really<br/>
&gt; really desperate-- with an offer to donate).<br/>
&gt; But I don&#39;t go looking for a specific person. I&#39;ll just ask &quot;Can anyone<br/>

&gt; &gt; Illusion Spirit Wolf is fun too.  &quot;Can you SoW me?&quot;  Then when you tell<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; sorry you cant you will begin to see the true colors of some people when<br/>
&gt; &gt; they skip asking or explaining why they thought you could and go right<br/>

&gt; &gt; I thought it asked you that also, but I noticed the last couple times I<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; fighing and encumbered in SK and went to drop the copper I had that it<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; ask me if I wanted to so maybe they changed it.  My new favorite<br/>

&gt; &gt; You have to go to Kelethin. People in Kelethin are friendlier. Heh.<br/>
&gt; looking<br/>
&gt; &gt; like PP is funny. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; That reminds me, isn&#39;t the game supposed to ask you if you want to drop<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; money when you are clicking it over something? Bc I tried to trade money<br/>
&gt; &gt; with someone once and it didn&#39;t trade but the money was gone. The person<br/>
&gt; &gt; informed me that I had dropped it on the ground. I had not meant to drop<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; and it didn&#39;t ask me if I wanted to.. Was that a glitch?<br/>
