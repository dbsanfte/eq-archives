<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110887354">Ok the guy you want to kill is easy, he&#39;s on the first floor as soon <br/>
as you enter befallen, but yeah I would suggest taking a tank friend <br/>
with you, that or a mage/necro who has a pet that can dish out <br/>
damage. But don&#39;t worry about the lower parts till later on when you <br/>
want XP or just want to futz around in the place. You mainly want to <br/>
focus on the first floor, in the main all area by the skulls with the <br/>
glowing eyes. right infront of that cave area (if you can call it a <br/>
cave even =/...) is the mob you want to kill, if he&#39;s not there, just <br/>
keep killing that mob in that spot till he spawns. btw don&#39;t worry <br/>
about the doors too much nothing much behind them unless you&#39;re bored <br/>
and want to kill some necro&#39;s (human/gnome so far that I have seen) <br/>
killed that skeleton mob many times trying to bring up my pick lock <br/>
at lvl 52 LOL. 150 lvls in 5 hours! WOOT LMAO *sighs* no life in <br/>
picklock at that moment in time. you can&#39;t kill the sir <br/>
whateverhisnameis I tried to already, you can only kill the mob that <br/>
spawns him. hope this helps well peace out and good luck.<br/>
