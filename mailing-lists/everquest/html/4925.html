<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604588725">I have been playing EQ for about 2 years and enjoying every min. of <br/>
it. I play for only about 1 to 2 hours a day (maybe) so I really get <br/>
in to my time in the game. This sunday something new happened to me.<br/>
I have a 24th level Bar. shaman and have been grouping in Pav. <br/>
Caverns to work up in levels. I logged on and ooc&#39;ed asking to group. <br/>
I got not responce. I went to camp 1 aqnd found a good mixed group <br/>
working it very well (8 people mixed classes teaming very nicely) so <br/>
I went to camp 2, There were 5 people 3 casters (2 mages and a necro) <br/>
a ranger and a fighter) all around 19 to 20., all at 100% health. I <br/>
asked if they wanted a healer/buffer and got &quot;Shouted down&quot; &quot;This <br/>
Camp is TAKEN GO AWAY&quot;!!!....ok so I truned and started back. I got <br/>
jumped by 3 of the bandits. I Camp was not doing anything so I pulled <br/>
the mobs back in to the camp and ooced here is your mobs take them I <br/>
don&#39;t want to steal your kills(all the time I am getting pounded) .. <br/>
no one said anything so I ran .. about 1/2 way back I get ooc&#39;ed &quot;WTF <br/>
Frezz wait...&quot; as I as all ready near the cave to SH and the zone I <br/>
just left... the &quot;group&quot; because of 5 mobs brok camp and ran (as they <br/>
ran they pulled 2 more) and &quot;telled&quot; me to death about how they were <br/>
going to cause me problems every time they see me and ect...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A. did I do wrong by trying to &quot;not steal&quot; the camp&#39;s mobs<br/>
<br/>
b. what do I do about the &quot;problems&quot; I might have later by thes <br/>
people?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I like doing the right thing and playing with people not causeing <br/>
problems for others...<br/>
