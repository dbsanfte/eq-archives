<div id="ygrps-yiv-811335054"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">We had a guy who was looting out of turn in the group that was standing too 
<br>close to the camp in the incident I described earlier. &nbsp;I never want to be 
<br>the bad guy and disband them. &nbsp;But I have to say in your case you pretty much 
<br>have no choice. &nbsp;At least in mine when I told him he looted a df belt out of 
<br>turn he gave it to rightful owner. &nbsp;

<br>who were ninja-looters in my group. One guy in particular. He kept looting
<br>while we were still fighting. I told him to stop it. (with my female alt).
<br>He tried to claim he had only looted once corpse but I watched him loot 3 in
<br>a row. I told him to stop looting and let others have a chance. Still he
<br>kept hogging loot. We killed a Lego. He sat back and didn&#39;t do much while we
<br>killed it but he ran up and looted. He looted a bronze weapon. I said I
<br>wanted to roll for it. Everyone rolled, I got the highest roll. Not only did
<br>he not roll, but he refused to give the brozne weapon up. So he got df
<br>shoulderpads AND the bronze weapon. Finally, we killed the orc weaponsmith.
<br>I said his name and &quot;Do NOT loot the weaponsmith&quot;. He looted it. I
<br>immediately disbanded him. He stood around for awhile and didn&#39;t seem to
<br>realize he wasn&#39;t in group until he tried to loot something. Then he asked
<br>to be allowed back into group. I said &quot;no&quot;. I think he was shocked that a
<br>female character was so &quot;harsh&quot;. I only wish I had disbanded him before he
<br>could loot the Lego.
