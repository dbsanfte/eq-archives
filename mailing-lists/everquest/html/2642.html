&gt;   They said it was ok for you to loot though, right?<br/>
&gt;   Just bc someone appears to be twinked doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t need money. I<br/>
&gt;   had someone who wouldn&#39;t let me loot in group bc<br/>
&gt; he claimed I was twinked. I<br/>
&gt;   was around lvl 25 and wearing a Green Silk Drape<br/>
&gt; and poking away with a<br/>
&gt;   drachnid leg tip that I bought off a merchant in<br/>
&gt; Neriak. I had no money bc<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;d spent it all on spells and the equipment that<br/>
&gt; I had.<br/>
&gt;   Sorry, pet peeve. The attitude that someone with<br/>
&gt; good gear doesn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt;   money can get you into trouble.<br/>
&gt;   luv,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I made about 300pp in the Highpass Basement just<br/>
&gt; looting everything because<br/>
&gt;   everyone else was so twinked they don&#39;t need<br/>
&gt; money.<br/>

&gt;     Don&#39;t forget buffing for donations. At lvl 30<br/>
&gt; Rangers get sow. So you can<br/>
&gt;     sow for donations if no druids, beastlords, or<br/>
&gt; shamans are around.<br/>
&gt;     luv,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;     I guess the obvious ways I can think of are to<br/>
&gt; kill lots of green mobs.<br/>
&gt;   Camp<br/>
&gt;     items in dungeons. Practice trade skills. I have<br/>
&gt; spent a great deal of<br/>
&gt;   time<br/>
&gt;     in the Highpass Basement and when I am in a<br/>
&gt; group where everyone is<br/>
&gt;   twinked,<br/>
&gt;     they often let me get all the loot.<br/>
