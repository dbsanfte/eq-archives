<b>Subject:</b> Fighter armor and weapons at low level <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-58621823">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if some of you could help me.  I got my hubby involved in EQ<br/>
so he&#39;d stop bugging me to get off the computer.  He&#39;s got a 10th lvl<br/>
halfling fighter, and I know next to nothing about the melee classes.<br/>
Assuming he&#39;s got about 1000pp to spend, what are his best choices for armor<br/>
and a decent weapon.  He&#39;s got a fine steel longsword right now, which seems<br/>
to suck, and leather armor.  Should he go to bronze or fine steel armor?<br/>
What does a full suit of either of these cost?  And what&#39;s the best weapon<br/>
for him at this point?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m trying to powerlevel him just a little so we can go adventuring<br/>
together, though I&#39;m not generally a fan of leveling people that don&#39;t know<br/>
what they&#39;re doing.  They should die plenty and learn like the rest of us<br/>
did :P  I have a 16 druid and he just needs a couple of levels so we can<br/>
hang out.  Is there a good place to do this quickly?  All I can think of at<br/>
the moment is to fear kite lions and bears, oh my, and let him hack them up.<br/>
There&#39;s so darn many people in EC these days, though.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help!!<br/>
<br/>
Laura</div>
