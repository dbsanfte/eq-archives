<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197785333">Don&#39;t.  I&#39;m sorry to make it sound so blunt, but HighPass is terrible.  I<br/>
never advise anyone to go there.  Eastern Karana has another exit than<br/>
HighPass.  That is to the Beholder&#39;s maze.  It&#39;s terrible too, but you get a<br/>
running chance.  It brings you to RunneyEye.  A bit better than HighPass.<br/>
That brings you to Misty Thicket, then to Rivervale.  From there go to<br/>
Kithicor Forest, which is where HighPass would have led you, if it were not<br/>
so terrible.<br/>

Ok, I&#39;&#39;m a 9th Level Barbarian Warrior and last night I decided to make the <br/>
treacherous run from Queynos to Freeport.  I got as far as High Pass Hold <br/>
when I was waylaid and killed by a gnoll soothsayer.  I retrieved my corpse <br/>
and then spent an hour running around trying to find the way out of High<br/>
Pass <br/>
Hold towards Freeport.  IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING!!!  It was also scary as hell <br/>
seeing how I was practically naked and the only player character in the <br/>
entire zone.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please give me some advice or direction in how to get the hell<br/>
<br/>
out of High Pass Hold and through to Freeport?<br/>
