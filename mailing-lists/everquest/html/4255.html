<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121065178">Yes I had the exact same error. It was cause by my screen resolution <br/>
being 32 bits when my game resolution was set to 16 bits. <br/>
You can set the graphics resolution once your in the game, but to get <br/>
in the game try setting your display to 16 bits, 32 bits etc until <br/>
one works. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that solves your problem.<br/>
