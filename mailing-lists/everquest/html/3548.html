<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994705806">Jenn is quite correct Su,<br/>
<br/>
The SCA encompasses  more than one can assimilate in a short period of time.<br/>
I&#39;ve been in the SCA for going on 7 years as of this coming Labor Day<br/>
Weekend and I am still learning  a lot of things.  Besides being an officer<br/>
on a local and Kingdome level I am also heavily into the lighter weapons<br/>
aspect of the period (Rapier) and am doing my best to have a nice Rapier<br/>
melee unit  ready for a week long event  in Lumberton, MS set in March Known<br/>
as Gulf Wars.<br/>
<br/>
but as Jenn said the SCA is one of the best clubs around to teach and learn<br/>
about  the Middle Ages.  Being able to &quot;live&quot;  in the time period is fun.<br/>
Not to mention the various cultures that were prevalent  during that era<br/>
that you can choose from.  Mongol, Welsh Scots, Irish Japanese, German,<br/>
Italian, French.  Basically any culture that is documentable  and had some<br/>
kind of proven contact with Middle Ages Europe is available for you to<br/>
choose from.<br/>
<br/>
Basically an entire cornucopia of knowledge can be had<br/>

&gt; &gt; What is SCA?<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Society for Creative Anachronism  Medieval re-creation group dedicated<br/>
&gt; to education about the middle ages. Check out www.sca.org for more info<br/>
&gt; than you can ever take in and understand.  It&#39;s more than the<br/>
&gt; description tho, it&#39;s a family of close friends who will usually do<br/>
&gt; anything for each other.  It&#39;s camping trips where you dress in medieval<br/>
&gt; clothes for up to 2 weeks, don&#39;t ever call the clothing a costume, we<br/>
&gt; call it garb.  How do you explain SCA?  It&#39;s teaching leadership and<br/>
&gt; respect for elders to our children.  It&#39;s awarding the hard work and<br/>
&gt; dedication of all the people who put the events together so we can have<br/>
&gt; fun.  It&#39;s learning how to do medieval cooking, sewing, felting,<br/>
&gt; drumming, knitting chainmail, dancing, pounding out armor, just for the<br/>
&gt; fun of learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So much more too.<br/>
