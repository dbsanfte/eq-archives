 </span></blockquote>this is something i tell all new people, and it doesn&#39;t matter<br/>
it is an online rpg, or a paper and pen version. i use the term<br/>
rpg here, because of the class selection you have.<br/>
<br/>
as an example, i played EQ, then Asheron&#39;s Call was released.<br/>
at that time i already had my mage as main. &quot;Of course&quot; i wanted<br/>
to play an caster in AC as well, but it was very frustrating,<br/>
because i had to learn a new game interface, the game mechanics<br/>
in a new world, and somehow there wasn&#39;t much information on how<br/>
you even learn spells there (it is quite a different concept of<br/>
spells in AC, than in UO, EQ, and AO. on the other hand, behing<br/>
such a helpless puppy, i met people there, who became my alliance<br/>
(sort of a guild, but it is even a game concept: a patron gains<br/>
exp from the followers).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And do try out several characters.  And check out the EQ sites for <br/>
&gt; creations guides, unless you just want to go for it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i think even if you know what you like to do, one should have a<br/>
look at the other classes, just to get the basic &quot;feeling&quot; for<br/>
that class. also i think it is a good idea to have seen another<br/>
class, because having a very strong concept about what i want to<br/>
play, maybe quite something different than the &quot;basic&quot; description<br/>
of that class. and before you get frustrated it is better to switch<br/>
to something you can enjoy again ... pausing a char, or even the<br/>
game, isn&#39;t really a bad thing, especially if you play something<br/>
as addictive as the online &quot;rpg&quot; games.<br/>
