<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085039068">I for one cannot really understand why people get upset when they are <br/>
inspected.  It is totally an issue of realism to me.  Is it not realistic <br/>
that when someone looks at you, they can see what type of boots you have, <br/>
what necklace you are wearing, what rings are on your fingers?  WHAT&quot;S THE <br/>
BIG DEAL!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Because EQ&#39;s graphic design does not make any distinguishing differences <br/>
visually for most items, including almost ALL jewelry - the inspect command <br/>
just seems to me to be a less than perfect way of looking at people.<br/>
<br/>
Just like in the real world, you may meet someone, they see an interesting <br/>
looking item on your neck, they simply ask &quot;Wow, nice necklace - where did <br/>
you get it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can choose to ignore them, lie, or tell the truth.  JUST like in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Now in real life, no one can see what&#39;s in your pockets, or your backpack, or <br/>
other container items, and NEITHER can they in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that they only get a name of an item and not it&#39;s stats is also <br/>
realistic.  Just like in real life they can see your clothes and jewelry and <br/>
not see the brand name.<br/>
<br/>
Lighten up folks :)<br/>
