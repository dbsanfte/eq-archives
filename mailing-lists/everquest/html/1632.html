&gt; <br/>
&gt; Verant says it&#39;s YOUR responsibility to keep your account secure.. Well,<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s not a damn thing in hell you can do if your dorm mate decides to<br/>
&gt; run a sniffer and there he&#39;ll be able to read your login name and password<br/>
&gt; in plaintext.. But Verant still thinks that it&#39;s the players<br/>
&gt; responsibility.. *sigh* braindead fools...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Actually there are a couple of viruses that were made specifically for<br/>
&gt; EverQuest, and they were quite successful.. If you know how much money<br/>
&gt; some people have made on just ebaying legit loot then you can figure out<br/>
&gt; how much they can make from spreading a simple EQ virus to gain access to<br/>
&gt; hundreds of accounts(I&#39;ve had one guildmate this year that had a virus<br/>
&gt; like that, she ended up being banned).. They get your account info, ebay<br/>
&gt; all tradable loot then they sell the account itself.. Unfortunately the<br/>
&gt; buyer is screwed since the real owner will report the theft most likely..<br/>
&gt; But the virus programmer still makes a bundle.. :(<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Where do you guys think its up..  Hundreds of accounts?   Please...   If<br/>
&gt; you have any real evidence please include some reference.. not just, I<br/>
&gt; have a friend whos equipment was stolen and sold on ebay.  Where was she<br/>
&gt; the whole time?  Did she notice her equipment as missing?  Where they able<br/>
&gt; to sell and trade all the items while none of her friends noticed she her<br/>
&gt; online?  Why was the account banned?  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; And the comment about &quot;sniffers&quot; and their use to gain access to EQ<br/>
&gt; information is trival to accessing any of your other private<br/>
&gt; information.   Where is it noted that your username and password are<br/>
&gt; transfered as plain text?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Ah well..  be paranoid if ya want to.. =)<br/>
