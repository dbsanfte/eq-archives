<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863743340">I have never played an Int based character but know many friend that <br/>
do as well as the fact that Wis based PC&#39;s share the same game play <br/>
as Int PS&#39;s do.  It is better to have Int or Wis gear until you <br/>
break the 200 mark.  if im correct the calculation for 200 and below <br/>
is (INT or WIS / 5) + 2 after 200 it is 5 mana for every 1 point of <br/>
wis or int after 200.  You do the math.  Here is a mana calculator <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.graffe.com/spells/manaequasion.htm">http://www.graffe.com/spells/manaequasion.htm</a><br/>
play with it and see...  there are plenty of robes for int caster <br/>
for a very low price.  I have 2 for sale right now  for around 100pp.<br/>

&gt; Hmm I can&#39;t tell you the answer to your specific<br/>
&gt; question but my mage was given one of these as well<br/>
&gt; and I love it. I am level 34 and think it is a Great<br/>
&gt; piece of gear, unless you can afford a UBA TWINKED<br/>
&gt; one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I too look forward to what others have to say about<br/>
&gt; this one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Great Question<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all...<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am just wondering.... I am a Human Mage and I just<br/>
&gt; &gt; recently <br/>
&gt; &gt; acquired the Robe of the Ishva. This item has no<br/>
&gt; &gt; intelligence but it <br/>
&gt; &gt; does have +50 Mana. Can someone please tell me what<br/>
&gt; &gt; is better for a <br/>
&gt; &gt; mage? I normally buy Intelligence items, but someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; has told me that <br/>
&gt; &gt; direct Mana is better. Can I get your opinions<br/>
&gt; &gt; please????<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>
