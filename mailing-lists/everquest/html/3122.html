<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061227583">Heh. I was literally lvl 45 before I even got over 800pp. That was about<br/>
when I hit GD and started raking in money and levelling up. My cleric dinged<br/>
52 the other day. :-)<br/>
I was able to buy some rygor armor too. :-)<br/>

Honestly, for the most part, money does not really start to get easier until<br/>
you hit the low to mid 20&#39;s, as at that point, depending upon where you<br/>
hunt, mobs start to drop fine steel and bronze weapons, not to mention<br/>
chainmail and bronze armor.  There are certain areas, and mobs you can camp<br/>
at most levels, from about 6 on, that drops a bit better gear than others.<br/>
The only other way to gain much in the way of pp at the lower levels is to<br/>
drop every cp earned into a tradeskill such as smithing, or tailoring, to<br/>
get it up to over 100, where you can sell stuff to other players, such as<br/>
player made backpacks, and banded armor.  All it takes to find the right<br/>
mobs is experimentation, and research, eventually you will find what you are<br/>
looking for.<br/>

  I to thought that there were quick fix ways of getting money, but all it<br/>
comes down to is killing the right mobs, i.e farming giants etc, selling<br/>
your wares from tradeskills and farming items such as centi weapons etc. a<br/>
lot of ppl tend to use a high lvl char to fund thier twinks, which is most<br/>
likely the reason for the excessive amounts of money players buy/sell things<br/>
for - sometimes it feels like im trading in russian rouble&#39;s as in pp being<br/>
near worthless :(<br/>
<br/>
  i have seen some of these guides but havn&#39;t bought one yet so i have no<br/>
idea as to there real value or content.Most likely they are like other<br/>
official Game Guides for other games i.e a waste of time and money, anything<br/>
in the guides you can probably find out just by asking the right questions<br/>
or checking out sites such as alakazam and casters realm, i would ask around<br/>
see if anyone has bought one before paying for information.<br/>

  &gt;Does anyone know a good way to make money in Everquest. You find<br/>
  &gt;these websites with these huge secrets to making plat. but who<br/>
  &gt;knows. I just started, and didn&#39;t know this game could be so<br/>
  &gt;addictive. I am a wood elf ranger. I boosted all my bonus points<br/>
  &gt;to str at 90. So its not so bad. Im only level 3 though.<br/>
