<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289256040">Yay! Finally got my copy of EverQuest.. :)<br/>
So now I&#39;m not so bummed out anymore.. Just got one problem now..<br/>
Someone has taken the name Avron on Fennin Ro.. hehe.. I don&#39;t know if you<br/>
think that matters but to me it does, I&#39;ve used Avron for years and now<br/>
when I have been waiting for EverQuest the past weeks I have written a<br/>
detailed characteristics/history for the character too.. So heh..<br/>
Anyways I will try to think up a new name.. But expect to see me out there<br/>
on Fennin Ro.. :)<br/>
<br/>
- Avron -</div>
