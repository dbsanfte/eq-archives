<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768183842">My view:<br/>
<br/>
1)  A player should be able to play the game any way they wish, as long as it doesn&#39;t directly affect the play of others in a negative way.  Some people like to role-play, some people are powergamners & some people simple enjoy playing the game for what it is.  If a person wishes to get a walkthrough for a quest, let him have his fun.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Spoilers are unavoidable.  There is nothing Verant or anybody can do to eliminate them.  They are there for those that want/need them.<br/>
<br/>
3)  If the polls are saying that people want walkthroughs, then it seems you are in the minority.  :)  Seriously, the polls may be a bit weighted towards powergamers but it is apparent that enough people want the spoilers to warrent their existance.<br/>

this is pretty lame... this is an RPG, but on all the polls, people want<br/>
walkthroughs on quests? where is the fun in that? maybe a hint or 2, but its<br/>
no fun walking around following a guide telling you to avoid so and so<br/>
whatever to not get killed.<br/>
just wondering if anyone aggrees with this...<br/>
