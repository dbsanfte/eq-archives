<div id="ygrps-yiv-979167040">I had to log and go to work, so didn&#39;t have time to call for a rez. <br/>
Didn&#39;t lose too much, so I can get back my loss. Probably go for <br/>
brutes again for most of it, as the hides are still good for <br/>
developing my tailoring.<br/>
<br/>
The kitties do look good, and I may do that to get up to a higher <br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t yet decided what faction is most valuable to me in Velious. <br/>
Need to study this one a bit.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I got tired of camping Brutes in Warsliks Woods, so finally made <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; journey to Velious. I took the boat, just to have done it once. <br/>
Found <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; good idea, but ...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have not been fortunate in hunting. Level 34 puts me low on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; food chain in EW. I have tried my standard hunting routine from <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; ... this is true.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; [...]<br/>
&gt; &gt; offered to train them away, and did so. I got my corpse and got <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff back, but am now a high 33 again. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; why didn&#39;t you call for a rez? there should be enough (high level) <br/>
clerics around ... especially when loosing a level, i would try <br/>
&gt; to get a 49+ rez.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I may have to rethink my Velious career. Solo at 34 in EW seems a <br/>
bit <br/>
&gt; &gt; tough, even if I need the tufts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; try IC and go for cougars, or move further to GD (and thurgadin - <br/>
the lovely dwarven town) and hunt tizmaks (lowest level i hit <br/>
&gt; them with a group was with 2x26 monk, but i had to bring my cleric <br/>
after some rounds).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; or try Drakkel Wolves if you want to go for thurgadin and skyshrine <br/>
faction ... the Tracking Wolves should be a bit lower, and <br/>
&gt; give you good faction with Kael (frost giants) but lower it with <br/>
Thurgadin.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IMHO it is better to start with Thurgadin (and SS) faction, because <br/>
it makes the start in Velious easier: two zones you can <br/>
&gt; call home (or actually use the bank ... :-). also - if your SS <br/>
faction is good enough - you can gate/port to WL without <br/>
&gt; checking if Wuoshi is up (normally this poor lady is killed every <br/>
week). and if you start hunting in CS (another quad kiter ... :-<br/>
&gt; ( ... zone is still popular for this, but too small to supply many <br/>
quadders at once) you have a city just one zone away (on the <br/>
&gt; other hand this shouldn&#39;t be really a problem for a druid).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; after completing (or getting it to a certain level) some of the <br/>
thurgadin quests (like the prayer shawl) and you don&#39;t need <br/>
&gt; Thurgadin as a base, you can start to work on your Kael faction <br/>
with killing Dwarves in icewell keep (this is sort of higher <br/>
&gt; level stuff). so after some (long) time, you can have SS and Kael <br/>
faction.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; good luck and have fun<br/>
