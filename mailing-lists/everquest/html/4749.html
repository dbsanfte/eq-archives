<div id="ygrps-yiv-813996906">I mean this in the nicest way possible, but if you spelled things <br/>
correctly, it might help your case a little more. I&#39;m not trying to <br/>
insult you, but if I were someone working for Sony and I saw the <br/>
spelling errors in this I would assume that you were either a child <br/>
or that you didn&#39;t really care enough about the message to use <br/>
correct spelling.<br/>
A few things to point out: the correct spelling is Verant. However <br/>
Verant no longer has anything to do with Everquest. Quitting is the <br/>
correct spelling. Meditating, Originally, Having, Minutes, Available, <br/>
Appreciate and so forth. Spellcheck can run a long ways.<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t use &quot;horse shit&quot; as an expression in your letter.<br/>
That said, I can understand why they &quot;nerfed&quot; C2 and C3. It made it <br/>
harder for lower level enchanters to compete with higher level <br/>
enchanters in selling their buffs, and it made fighting less <br/>
challenging for lower level characters than the creators had <br/>
intended. Basically, players became so dependent on the buffs that <br/>
they did not learn how to conserve mana and play the characters in a <br/>
manner the creators had intended.<br/>
It did not take the fun out of the game. There are still many things <br/>
to enjoy. Some of the changes have made the game more exciting. They <br/>
have also added new quests for lower level characters and added some <br/>
features to make things easier for new characters that are just <br/>
starting out.<br/>
Some examples: When I first started out if you were low level and you <br/>
died you had a short period of time to get your corpse back. If you <br/>
did not you lost it and all of your gear. And you lost xp even at <br/>
level 6. Now you don&#39;t lose your corpse or xp until level 10.<br/>
There is a feedback system you can use and you can email customer <br/>
service. I think that quitting EverQuest over a few changes is a bit <br/>
extreme. But I guess what it comes down to is your enjoyment of the <br/>
game. If you no longer enjoy it, then you do not have to play.<br/>
luv,<br/>
