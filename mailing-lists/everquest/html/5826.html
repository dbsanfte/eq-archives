<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EverQuest] Task system <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-86196515">I&#39;ve now got a couple of my characters working on tasks. My 49 ranger was<br/>
advised by the task masters to go to Rathe Mountains for a task. I did, and<br/>
everything was pointing me to Lower Guk. I&#39;ve never really been through<br/>
Upper and Lower Guk, and going that far underground with a ranger just makes<br/>
me concerned.<br/>
<br/>
I abandoned the task. The next thing I tried was getting a task from a task<br/>
master in Overthere. It sent me into Burning Woods, where one of the things<br/>
I had to do was enter the giant fort and scout it out. To accomplish that, I<br/>
discovered I had to run into the middle of the fort. I was invisible, but as<br/>
soon as I got within agrro range, I started wailed on by a giant.<br/>
Thankfully, a group was pulling giants from the fort, so it was somewhat<br/>
abandoned. I trained a giant or two out and ran for the zone line. The next<br/>
step is to kill 10 skeletons (can&#39;t remember exactly what type, but I know<br/>
they con dark blue -- not sure how well bow-kiting will work in such a busy<br/>
zone).<br/>
<br/>
Frustrated with such difficult and dangerous tasks for my 49 ranger, I tried<br/>
a task with 10 cleric. I was sent into Innothule Swamp from a PoK task<br/>
master and told to kill 10 bull alligators (most con white, some a healthy<br/>
dark blue). I had to run for my life and died about 10 feet from the PoK<br/>
book. I didn&#39;t realize bull alligators helped each other out. I got trounced<br/>
by two of them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m becoming increasingly convinced that tasks are not soloable. :(<br/>

The only place that would give me a task was in the<br/>
Dreadlands, and it sent me ( a 52 Druid) into Chardok<br/>
for a recon mission.  Thought it couldn&#39;t be that bad,<br/>
but I had never been to Chardok before.  The mission<br/>
was to enter the fort inside Chardok and explore the<br/>
area around the first bridge.  Went in and found the<br/>
fort (was invised) opened the door, it squeaks and<br/>
every mob in Chardok seems to have heard it, and what<br/>
resulted can only be described as Woodelf paste.<br/>
