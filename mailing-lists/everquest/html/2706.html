<div id="ygrps-yiv-582168678">I don&#39;t think you were harsh enough.  When I started out I was so excited<br/>
when I discovered eqtraders for the sewing recipes.  I wore my homemade<br/>
leather armor for a long time.  I didn&#39;t really get any help when I started<br/>
out except maybe some buffs from people helping out as I was training all<br/>
the spiders to the guards in GFay.   Anybody can make money in the game if<br/>
they&#39;d just shut up and start killing and looting the mobs.  I made alot of<br/>
money just looting corpses I found (a little twinge of guilt there until I<br/>
found out they had 2 full minutes to loot before it was available to me)<br/>
I&#39;ve never begged for money from other players<br/>
As I got higher, I&#39;ve had people begging from me.  I laugh at them most of<br/>
the time.  I never have money to spare.  I have offered advice and walkthrus<br/>
on quests tho, especially in Shar Vahl, those poor noob cats are totally<br/>
lost trying to figure out the town and where the NPCs are for citizen<br/>
quests.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I guess maybe I was a litte harsh to that newbie chanter, yes, but I have<br/>
  used my Druid&#39;s bank account to equip numerous new druids and rangers in<br/>
  that zone with full leather armor, a half-way decent newbie weapon, and a<br/>
  little buffing (skin like diamond, sow, strength of stone, thorns, regen),<br/>
  but not because they begged. I did it because they seemed to be players<br/>
that<br/>
  wanted to have fun and to play the game right, but needed a little boost,<br/>
  and I enjoy helping people. I don&#39;t enjoy beggars, though.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyone else have thoughts to share on players who spam the newbie zones<br/>
  asking to be given free money or items? I would be interested to see how<br/>
the<br/>
  others on this mailing list feel about the subject.<br/>
