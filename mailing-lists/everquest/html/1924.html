<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558611447">If you were healer for a well-balanced group that works well <br/>
together, I think so. The problem in Runnyeye is the shere numbers of <br/>
mobs at times and in places. Many lower level caster mobs, so you <br/>
cound get hit with spells often disrupting your own casting. The <br/>
deeper in and farther down you go, the harder it gets, as seems to be <br/>
the case for most dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
As a plus, I think an experience bonus is in place in Runnyeye.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hehe, I don&#39;t know the answer to your question about the ore, but <br/>
I had to<br/>
&gt; &gt; respond:<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am so happy to find out that I am not the only Druid that hates<br/>
&gt; dungeons.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Give me the wide open spaces of the Karanas, the Overthere, the<br/>
&gt; Dreadlands,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or even Rathe Mts. any day. Seems like every time I venture into, <br/>
say,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Runnyeye, Sol A, Sol B, or Lower Guk, I get killed. In fact I <br/>
just got<br/>
&gt; &gt; de-leveled back into hell 40 this past weekend because of some <br/>
nasty<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pickclaw Casters in the bottom level of Runnyeye. They didn&#39;t <br/>
like the<br/>
&gt; fact<br/>
&gt; &gt; that I was healing a level 24 warrior that wanted some Blackened <br/>
Alloy,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was too proud to desert him to his death to save my own skin.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I took the advice of others here and having finished my goals <br/>
in EK I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; moved to SK. I have found the gnolls camped heavily, but while <br/>
there<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have found Aviak Rooks wandering with sufficient frequency to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; profitable. I solo them, getting about 1.5pp average in cash and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; loot. Not too bad, and I can pick off something else when they <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; too thin.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone know if the hq ore dropped in Runnyeye is no drop? My <br/>
druid<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; does not do that well in dungeons, so hunting up the stuff <br/>
myself is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not a happy prospect.<br/>
