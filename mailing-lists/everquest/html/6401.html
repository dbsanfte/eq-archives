<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168823126">Hey Kids...Been gone awhile...been busy..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in talking to my old EQ chums and with what I read on the <br/>
websites, there is/has been some talk about SOE making a &quot;classic&quot; <br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
Now the &quot;classic&quot; server would be EQ prior to PoP, no adds or toys, <br/>
with the exception of the stuff necessary. This would mean no PoK, no <br/>
Guild Lobby, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing that many of you have been here since around Beta or just after <br/>
and that most of you can honestly say &quot; I remember when... or Back in <br/>
the Day we had to run from X t Y and it was 4 day run....&quot;; I am <br/>
curious to know if any of you kids would use such a server, or have you <br/>
all become stuck on how things are now that going back to the old way <br/>
would kill the game for you?<br/>
<br/>
As always, but now just plainly nosey..<br/>
<br/>
