<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087164563">The game has been out for some time now and a majority of the new players<br/>
are those with other older characters.  This would allow them to enhance<br/>
their character with equipment either passed on or purchased with funds earn<br/>
as another character.  This would allow them to pretty much solo through a<br/>
number of characters.  Experience helps as well.. A majority of them can<br/>
pretty much solo to at least level 20.  However after about level 12 or so<br/>
most players begin to group up.  A Druid like yourself will be able to solo<br/>
well after you reach level 14.  However this is not to say you cant group at<br/>
any time.  Grouping IMHO is a fun aspect of the game.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re a druid my friend :) Spells will always be more important then your<br/>
melee skills.  See if you can purchase a nice FS (Fine Steel) 1hs or<br/>
something that is rated at least 5 dmg and you will be fine.  You have a<br/>
number off nice spells that you will begin to rely on much more every level.<br/>
At the moment you probably have a Snare ( which slows down a target so its<br/>
easier to stay a distance from them and still cast ) a Burst of Flame ( is a<br/>
direct damage spell ) and a flame lick ( it&#39;s a low level dot spell that<br/>
damages a character over a period of time.  Not to mention you can heal<br/>
yourself :)<br/>
<br/>
Some people play the warrior for its simplicity, however, I think that its<br/>
better to first play a caster.  Afterwards when you create a Warrior you&#39;ll<br/>
understand the weaknesses of a caster class and know how and when to support<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I always get confused on where I am going. I think I venture too far <br/>
out of the city area.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cherish that feeling while you can. :) it would be great to have that<br/>
feeling of mystery towards the world of EQ.  That&#39;s when its most exciting.<br/>
:)<br/>

Duhase.. <br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Newbie has questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have just bought the Everquest trilogy box and have played a few <br/>
times.  I have found a few helpful people out there but it seems most <br/>
are playing solo. Is this normal?  They suggest grouping so that is <br/>
my first question.<br/>
<br/>
Next, I am having trouble getting money to get decent weapons. I am a level<br/>
3 Druid and only have a club.  One guy gave me some <br/>
money but it wasn&#39;t much.  He suggested buying more spells, but I <br/>
really would like a good weapon.  Dealing 1-3 points of damage just <br/>
isn&#39;t cutting it.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly for now, should I be starting with a fighter type until I <br/>
really get use the the game and interface.  I really love wizards and <br/>
those type of characters but understand if playing a warrior makes it <br/>
easier.<br/>
<br/>
I always get confused on where I am going. I think I venture too far <br/>
out of the city area.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for letting the newbie post?  ;)<br/>
