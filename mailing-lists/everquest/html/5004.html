&gt; I have never done Crystal Caverns. So, I wearied of mugging Frost<br/>
&gt; Giants in various locations, and went looking for something<br/>
&gt; interesting to do solo. I first returned to some favorite haunts where<br/>
&gt; I knew Hill Giants were and took a few of those. A bit more profitable<br/>
&gt; than Frost Giants, but not so interesting that I spent much time<br/>
&gt; hunting them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I decided to try CC. Went to the Rygor fortress, and found the<br/>
&gt; little building at the back. Could see the &quot;snowball&quot; inside, but an<br/>
&gt; iron bar gate was blocking the doorway. I had never heard of this<br/>
&gt; being there. Anyone know what is up? Was I just not fully informed, or<br/>
&gt; is this gate something new?<br/>
