Subject: Stein of Moggok Quest<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I&#39;d like to wish everyone a Happy Easter.<br/>
<br/>
Have a question. I did the Stein Quest twice today. Cast Illusion:DE <br/>
on my Lvl 14 Erudite Enchanter, and cast Alliance on Clurg. I conned <br/>
Clurg as Amiable both times. Both times I said &quot;What special book&quot;, <br/>
he replied, and I gave him the compodium. Then he said something <br/>
like &quot;You must have worked hard to get my book, I am indebted to you. <br/>
I don&#39;t like being indebted, so take this as payment&quot;. He didn&#39;t give <br/>
me anything; no PP, no stein. I petitioned the GM. Does anyone have a <br/>
clue as to what is going on?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

i do know they have been doing something to the illusions recently.  heard that you can&#39;t use illusion wolf to buy from the brownies anymore, only druid wolfform works.  that will disappoint alot of enchanters I know, the distilled mana spells are on those brownies.  Makes it 10 times harder to get them.<br/>
I would petition until you get a response, sounds like you did everything right, the racial illusions are supposed to be working correctly, it&#39;s just the other types of illusions that aren&#39;t supposed to be giving faction changes.</div>
