<div id="ygrps-yiv-247989567">I honestly don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never used or seen it used in a configuration<br/>
like that before. I&#39;ve used it with dialup and DSL before, only. You might<br/>
want to google for their homepage....I can&#39;t think of the URL...and go<br/>
check.<br/>

&gt; Would Sygate work for 5 computers to share a satellite connection that has<br/>
&gt; to be connected directly to a computer via usb port and run the ISPs<br/>
&gt; software? I used Windows Network Setup Wizard to establish my network. It<br/>
&gt; leaves much to be desired. The computers all run WinXP Home edition.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes. I have 5 on a single connection, myself. One is directly connected<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the DSL, and runs a program called Sygate which shares the connection to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other machines. It has a special configuration package for EQ, but<br/>
worked<br/>
&gt; &gt; fine without it, for me, so try working without it first. If you have<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; &gt; trouble with it, email me, it has a few rare but known issues that can<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard to diagnose but are pretty easy to fix.<br/>
