<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557941683">Matt, you&#39;re right - the Robe of Tears does have some +AGI points. I <br/>
didn&#39;t know that AGI increases AC, thanks for the heads-up. Is there <br/>
a website that shows what stats boost others? I know that INT <br/>
increases MANA (for lower-level Chanters I hear). But not sure on <br/>
what else helps what.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help on the AC thing :)<br/>
