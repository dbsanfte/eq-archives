<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571190701">30th level ranger can go to Frontier Mountains and<br/>
solo some of the Giants. Hardest part here is outside<br/>
you can get flanked in the back by wondering goblins<br/>
and other mobs like the Burnai.<br/>
<br/>
Another spot you can try is The Overthere.  A place<br/>
outside you can use snare, root, etc as well as make a<br/>
B-Line to the POK book if you get inb trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Keep SOW up at all times<br/>
<br/>
Also if you do Frontier Mountains, Make sure you have<br/>
ROOT up , SOW&lt; and know the zone tunnel to DL cause<br/>
that it the closest zone area from fort.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

&gt; the Tarew Marr server,<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;ve soloing the sarnak fort for the last few<br/>
&gt; levels (since about<br/>
&gt; 24th)...so all in all, probably about a month&#39;s<br/>
&gt; worth of play time for me.<br/>
&gt; For the most part, the fort has been really quiet.<br/>
&gt; More often than not, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; the only one fighting there, but over the last few<br/>
&gt; days, the sarnak fort has<br/>
&gt; become an extremely popular spot for some reason and<br/>
&gt; the place is now<br/>
&gt; overcamped with groups that end up fighting over the<br/>
&gt; sarnaks that spawn<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I&#39;m trying to figure out where to take my ranger<br/>
&gt; next for when I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; soloing. When I&#39;m in a group, I have a number of<br/>
&gt; places to go, but I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; figure out what my next step should be for soloing.<br/>
&gt; Would anybody care to<br/>
&gt; share some suggestions, please?<br/>
