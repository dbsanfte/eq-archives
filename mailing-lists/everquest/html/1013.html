<div id="ygrps-yiv-737778525">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this group and was wondering whether we<br/>
can use this to look for items.<br/>
<br/>
Actually I am looking for a Crystalized Sword for my<br/>
warrior on Xev server. If any of you has one and wants<br/>
to sell it, let me know okay?<br/>
<br/>
Lastly if this group is not meant to buy/sell/look for<br/>
stuff, please let me know as well so that I won&#39;t do<br/>
that again here :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
