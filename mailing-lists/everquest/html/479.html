<div id="ygrps-yiv-867016585">I really like the suggestions put forth by our mutual friend.  It would make<br/>
having languages important and also limit their access to those less incline to<br/>
learn such based on limited thinking capacity (low intelligence).  I know<br/>
several other roleplaying systems that your intelligence determines the number<br/>
of languages you can learn.  Just some food for thought.<br/>

&gt; Dear friends from EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wish to divide with you my opinion on languages and how to enchant<br/>
&gt; everquest using it better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Already in game is included languages, we have Troll, dark elf, halfling,<br/>
&gt; elf and some secret languages. But what is use of this very important<br/>
&gt; feature in game?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nearly nonexistent unfortunatly only some magic users use it for reading<br/>
&gt; some lost magic books in long lost languages and nothing more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In all citys merchants speak common, people in remonte huts talk common,<br/>
&gt; trolls talk common, elfs a nobile and arrogant race talk common you can go<br/>
&gt; in every city and every place and all shop vendors speak common ALL PLAYERS<br/>
&gt; talk perfect common also. So all other languages are nearly never used !!<br/>
&gt; Why to waste this valuable resurce ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What we can do,  as now in Verant they have under work a new race war<br/>
&gt; server it will be nice to include this option in new code and enchant this<br/>
&gt; interesting new idea!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My points to change<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.) I think that some MAX knowelege based on inteligence and wisdom for any<br/>
&gt; language can be imposted so that you can learn max awaful in dragon if you<br/>
&gt; have inteligence under 60. It is very strange to have a Troll wich speak<br/>
&gt; fluent and with melodic elf language or read a long lost book writen in<br/>
&gt; combine language.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.) all city vendors speak a local language and some rare speak also common<br/>
&gt; in some degre. In some citys arogant high elfs can speak only their<br/>
&gt; languages and will not hear any of  beast races languages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.) All players start with a race language based on total inteligence and<br/>
&gt; wisdom and common in some degre but not at maximum. On base of class i will<br/>
&gt; add some rare aditional languages but only for casters some base of<br/>
&gt; languages at wich are writen a basic spell books.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4.) all aditional lv of spells can be only writen if you have enough<br/>
&gt; knowelege in language on wich a scroll is writen. This can create a<br/>
&gt; traduction skills to translate spells from one language to another and so<br/>
&gt; on. Some paterns instructions can be in a specific language.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5.) In spell research you must have a tome with instruction in one hand and<br/>
&gt; a combine book in another and to create new spell is checked not only your<br/>
&gt; skill but also a language knowelege for language in wich is writen a book.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 6.) Npc will nor reply on your questions or trade with you if you dont know<br/>
&gt; a language enough<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This are only some of possible uses of languages and there are many more im<br/>
&gt; shure that some can be easily implemented right from start and others will<br/>
&gt; require much work and maybe will not enter in game untio a everquest 2 but<br/>
&gt; i think that here is hiden posibility to make a new profondity to this<br/>
&gt; great game .<br/>
