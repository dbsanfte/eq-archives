al.&nbsp; I am thinking of switching my OS back to windows XP. I currently have 
win ME on my system.&nbsp; The question is will Win XP make Everquest run 
better?&nbsp; I had XP on my system but I have done some upgrading since then 
and my system crashed twice when I was using XP and it crashed in a bad way I 
could start windows at one point.&nbsp; Well let me know any recommendations 
please.&nbsp; Thank you for your help and time.</font></div>
