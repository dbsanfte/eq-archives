<b>Subject:</b> Does anyone solo anymore? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207293521">After a year and a half of playing, I&#39;ve done a lot of group play and<br/>
a lot of duoing, but I seem to enjoy soloing more nowdays.  I can go<br/>
where I want, do what I want and keep the loot and xp for myself. <br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still like to group, but sometimes, for my own<br/>
peace of mind, I much prefer soloing.  Anyone else?</div>
