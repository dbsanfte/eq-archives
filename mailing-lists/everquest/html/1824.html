<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-124312852">Hey my EQ friends, just a thought. How nice could it be for Verant to <br/>
port EQ to LINUX so that we who wish not to have our computers <br/>
invaded by Big Brother (Microsoft) can play with a calm mind. Secure <br/>
in the knowledge that our personal freedoms are not being ripped from <br/>
us by the corporate elite.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thought for the day<br/>
