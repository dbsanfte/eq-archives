  <div style="FONT:10pt arial;"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Looking for some 
  volunteers</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>Hi all,<br><br>This is an odd request, but I am looking for 
  some Everquest players that <br>wouldn&#39;t mind being interviewed either by IM, 
  phone, or if practical in person. I <br>am a graduate student at the Institute 
  of Design at Illinois Institute of <br>Technology in Chicago. For one of my 
  classes, entitled Observing Users, we <br>have to study a product and its 
  users. Our group chose Everquest because we <br>think that it is very 
  interesting and complex. As a retired online gamer I know <br>how much fun and 
  involving the games can be. In fact, I am very tempted to <br>jump into 
  Everquest, but I am worried that I may lose concentration on my <br>studies. 
  If anyone is willing to devote a little of their time to helping us out we 
  <br>would really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are poor grad students and 
  will <br>not be able to compensate anyone who helps us out, but we will very 
  very <br>thankful. Thanks<br><br>Andrew Haywood<br><br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
