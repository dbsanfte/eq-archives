<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have two computers and two accounts and I want to 
play two characters to at least level 50. I want to be able to go into dungeons 
for experience instead of outdoor kiting. One of the characters I would like to 
be is&nbsp;a paladin. I have been playing a paladin/magician duo and it seems 
really good for dungeon play. I have been looking at necromancers, shaman and 
druids as well. They all seem to have their strengths and weaknesses. 
Paladin/Shaman duo seems really good, as the Shaman would be like a third tank. 
The others would go down fast when swarmed.</font></div></html></div>
