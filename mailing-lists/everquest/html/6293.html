<div id="ygrps-yiv-743254696">I&#39;m hoping that if I play a lower level monster and get xp as my higher level it might help alot because I&#39;m finding it hard to get xp currently because of my connection. I can&#39;t heal effectively and damage misreporting is killer.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt;As for the new expansion I&#39;m looking forward to it<br/>

&gt;I like the idea that I&#39;ll be able to actually hydra with some of my really <br/>
&gt;lower level alts that i have and still be able to get xp with em.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The idea of being a monster sounds pretty kewl as well<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for the Intelligent Weapons.  Kinda makes me think of the sword that <br/>
&gt;Cyric from the Forgotten Realms Avatar Series  had =)<br/>
