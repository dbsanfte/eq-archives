<div id="ygrps-yiv-183395064">Fast way to level?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t waste time looting, only kill fast. <br/>
Fight close to the guards, know when to run to the guards and give up the<br/>
fight. <br/>
Guards = friend, learn how to use them<br/>
Pick your fights wisely. <br/>
Don&#39;t waste your time grouping, every level can solo from atleast 1-10. <br/>
Do not chat in tells, ooc or shout, it will just waste your time,<br/>
concentrate on killing. <br/>
Don&#39;t zone or go to town, it takes up too much time.<br/>
Learn your health and mana. You won&#39;t have to med/sit to 50% just to get in<br/>
one kill.<br/>
Learn the right time to die. Remember, after death you come back full health<br/>
and mana. Very little if any exp lost on death from level 1-5. Your supplied<br/>
food and water on death the first few levels, atleast you use to.<br/>
<br/>
If you played the game a while, you get bored at times and do different<br/>
things. I have raced when new servers come up to see who could get to level<br/>
10 the fastest. I have power leveled and have been power leveled a lot.<br/>
Recently took my brothers Iksar monk from level 1 - 46 just out boredom over<br/>
the past holidays. ( it is really unbelievable how much Iksar can regen with<br/>
the right gear and regrowth ). If you have played the game, and know how it<br/>
works, I see nothing wrong with PLing. Mater of fact, I can find it very<br/>
gratifying, exciting and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, if this is your first character, strongly urge you not to some of<br/>
the things listed above, but that&#39;s not you asked.<br/>
<br/>
Sistily<br/>
60 Gnome Warlord<br/>
and many other characters<br/>

	Trying to keep discussions alive........<br/>
	What is a good way to level up fast.   Meaning, I see<br/>
	people say things like I can get from level 3-6 in<br/>
	around an hour.<br/>
<br/>
	Well, the other day, I was on 5 hours and just leveled<br/>
	once.<br/>
<br/>
	As a Newbie should we venture to more hostile grounds<br/>
	with others to level?  Should we go to the same types<br/>
	of places as a group but not form a group so I can<br/>
	level faster?  Or just stay in the newbie area until<br/>
	we get there?<br/>
<br/>
	Enough for now<br/>
<br/>
	Later all helpfuls.....<br/>
