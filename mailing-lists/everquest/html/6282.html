<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Undoubtedly no.&nbsp; There has been so many 
changes to the game since those two expansions that&nbsp; you&#39;d invariably have 
a very difficult time trying to level and get better gear.&nbsp; Sure you could 
still find places to level, but it would take you longer and you&#39;d be missing 
out on A LOT of great enhancements.&nbsp; I&#39;d highly reccomend if you&#39;re gonna 
get back into it to spend $30 and buy whatever bundle pack is available with all 
the expansions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Luclin there has been Planes of Power, Legacy 
of Ykesha, Lost Dungeons of Norrath, Omens of War, Dragons of Norrath, and a 9th 
one which I am forgetting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really think each expansion definitely 
offers something that makes the expansion worth getting.&nbsp; So good luck in 
whatever you decide to do.</font></div>
