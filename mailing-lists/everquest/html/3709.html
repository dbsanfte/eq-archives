<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310825742">I dissagre with you Su. What&#39;s rude is taking 30+ people to a raid and not<br/>
getting what you came for beacause you also broght people that can&#39;t do the<br/>
raid for one or another reason. One person delaying for half a minute while<br/>
afk making coffe or what ever will make up for a total loss of 15 minute if<br/>
you count every persons missed time. One person causing a 2 hour CR we<br/>
shouldn&#39;t even talk about. If you got the need to go afk every 10:th minute,<br/>
if you can&#39;t listen or if you don&#39;t know what you are doing you shouldnt<br/>
attend the high lvl raiding game. It&#39;s to time consuming for other people.<br/>
Then again, if you are raiding with people that doesn&#39;t care if they lose a<br/>
evening due to people not paying attention or whatever reason it is i guess<br/>
it&#39;s fine. <br/>
But i know i wouldn&#39;t put up with that shit. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t set aside much time for EQ so i want the time i use for EQ to be<br/>
good, either for me, my friends or my guild. If that makes me rude then<br/>
maybe i am rude. But i know that from the time i led raids my tolerant lvl<br/>
was low, very low. People may have called me harsh but they DID learn the<br/>
game and DID learn to pay attention.<br/>
<br/>
About the spamm part, you&#39;ll learn, either by misstake or someone telling<br/>
you. That&#39;s not a problem, the problem is with people not listening or<br/>
shutting up during events.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure your playstyle differs alot from mine, so i wanted to<br/>
finnish of telling you that this ain&#39;t a flame in any way, it&#39;s me stating<br/>
what i put up with.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to the 3 most important rules about raiding (cept a raid leader(s)<br/>
that knows what they are doing, it&#39;s their fault if the raid fails, no one<br/>
else to blame).<br/>
<br/>
1, Listen up and pay attention.<br/>
2, Know your class.<br/>
3, Shut the fuck up, don&#39;t use shout or the raid channel for unimportant<br/>
stuff like asking for buffs etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gonna try to dig out a pretty good document about EQ raiding, it has it<br/>
all.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; People don&#39;t listen because they don&#39;t want to listen,<br/>
&gt; plain and simple.  It is the biggest problem in raiding,<br/>
&gt; by far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree. Maybe some people don&#39;t want to listen but not all. Some people<br/>
try very hard but because of lag or too much spam miss things.<br/>
I had problems on my first raid to Hate because I kept missing messages<br/>
because I kept getting spammed with too many spell messages and at the time,<br/>
didn&#39;t know how to turn them off. I also lagged and did not receive messages<br/>
in time to take action.<br/>
Maybe people get distracted sometimes. But it is just a game. Real life can<br/>
interfere.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The best way to get attention and keep attention is to<br/>
&gt; boot people from raids that don&#39;t listen.  Have a person<br/>
&gt; wandering off after repeated tells to stay in camp, TL<br/>
&gt; him/her out.  It&#39;s the easiest way to get their<br/>
&gt; attention.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would only work if they accepted the TL.<br/>
And I would never use that tactic with my own guildies. That&#39;s just rude.<br/>
It&#39;s a game. It should be fun. And yeah, getting wiped out from someone not<br/>
listening isn&#39;t very fun, but I think it&#39;s even less fun to be nasty to<br/>
people.<br/>
