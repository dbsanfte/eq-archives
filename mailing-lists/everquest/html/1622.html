<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] As the Everquest Turns <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587173885">Well, this should give you someting to gossip about. In my guild I have a<br/>
friend,we&#39;ll just call her Luv. Luvs ex-boyfriend, Shift (that is his actual<br/>
character name on The Tribunal), was jealous that a married player gave Luv<br/>
an item.<br/>
They ended up breaking up. Luv started seeing someone else. Shift started<br/>
harassing her. He followed her around. Went to the zones she went to. She<br/>
asked him to leave her alone. he would still harass her. So, we&#39;re on a<br/>
guild raid and he shows up. He buffs me and is really polite. I thank him<br/>
and am polite to him. Then Luv explains that he is her ex. He comes up and<br/>
starts insulting her equipment. Saying stuff like &quot;That&#39;s a pathetic staff&quot;<br/>
and stuff like that. She politely responds &quot;Well, it&#39;s the best I can get at<br/>
my level&quot;. He makes some other snide remark. She tells me in group that he&#39;s<br/>
annoying her. He makes her feel threatened. He goes away for awhile bc we<br/>
start fighting stuff. (and we have another male character in group with us).<br/>
He comes back awhile later and starts talking to her. She tells me she<br/>
really doesn&#39;t want to talk to him. I tell him that she doesn&#39;t want to talk<br/>
to him. (as politely as I can). He hangs around for awhile just saying<br/>
nothing (as far as I know-- I think he might&#39;ve been sending her tells). I<br/>
told her to put him on /ignore. she said that she tried it and it didn&#39;t<br/>
work. He kept bugging her. I said maybe we should petition to make him go<br/>
away.<br/>
Anyways, our male group member left and it was just me and Luv. So this jerk<br/>
comes back. I state that the ledge is camped. He says &quot;I see that&quot;. I said<br/>
&quot;So you&#39;re here because..?&quot; He said he was going to pull a train to us. then<br/>
he shouts &quot;Where is my train?&quot; I tell him &quot;no no no. We already have as much<br/>
as we can handle here. don&#39;t pull any trains to us,thank you.&quot;<br/>
So he goes away. We fight some elites and run out of mana killing them.<br/>
Right after we were oom, he pulls a train of like 5 elites onto us saying<br/>
&quot;here, take it&quot; and then leaves us to die. Luv trites to run away. he sends<br/>
her a tell and laughs at her for running. I try to pull some off to buy her<br/>
some time. they come and aggro on me. I try to get to safety. we both call<br/>
for help. We both die. I see Shift outside and say &quot;You got me killed!&quot; he<br/>
turns and runs from me. I say &quot;Hey!&quot; and he just runs off and camps.<br/>
couldn&#39;t even have the decency to apologize to me. And he did it all to get<br/>
at his ex-gf. Jerk. I petitioned as soon as I had come back from being dead.<br/>
but he still logged before any GM answered Luv&#39;s petition. The GM never<br/>
answered mine. It really sucked.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m a female and feel the need to gossip.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know any females in RL that play the game.  Only my husband and his<br/>

&gt; Stuff like that...I find it amusing.  Everquest could turn into this huge<br/>
&gt; soap opera.  Who cares about loot, who&#39;s &quot;cheating&quot; on who?  It&#39;s just a<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; And since we have a former guide (or where you a GM) on here I have a<br/>
&gt; question.  When you get married and you take the surname of your<br/>
&gt; husband...can you hypenate???  I don&#39;t like his last name (my RL husband&#39;s<br/>
&gt; character that is).  It doesn&#39;t sound &quot;catchy&quot; with my first name.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok and I didn&#39;t know you could get divorced in Norrath.  I just find that<br/>
&gt; funny too.  I might want to marry my RL husband&#39;s character just to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok so anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I wonder how many of Norrath marriages have one person being a young<br/>
