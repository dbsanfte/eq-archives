<div id="ygrps-yiv-104570698">HI all,<br/>
<br/>
  I thought i&#39;d just add my 2c in.  Glad to see this NG start to pick up again too. :)<br/>
<br/>
I play a Human cleric and basically broke as well.  Almost every group i&#39;ve gotten into<br/>
loot up before the cleric does.  I played in one group for 4 hours and only looted <br/>
once.  During a random roll for a nice item (armor piece), the tanks got first roll on <br/>
it.  I&#39;m lvl 44 and still wearing some Bronze and Banded pieces.      <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing the cleric since the day EQ opened its servers to the public, and<br/>
joined Tunare (Hi Mu! :) ) the minute it went live.   I&#39;m not a power player, and in<br/>
all this time i&#39;ve only made it to lvl 44.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I did take a few months break inbetween.  What I noticed though is that as<br/>
the server ages, or maybe its the more ppl on the servers, or the level range of players<br/>
i&#39;m grouping with now, but groups have gotten very greedy.  The first 20-30 levels way back<br/>
when the server was still new, people were nice, loot was evenly distributed, and all was <br/>
good.  I take a few months break and come back and its gone down the toilet.<br/>
<br/>
These days I have to summon food and water just to save money.  I can&#39;t afford all my<br/>
lvl 44 spells yet either, which is a shame.  This is not to say that there aren&#39;t &quot;good&quot;<br/>
groups/people out there, but they&#39;re just very hard to find these days.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ciao,<br/>
-Knight; hopping one day to make it to lvl 50 and have All his spells. :)</div>
