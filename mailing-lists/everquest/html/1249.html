<div><font size="2">master looting works well, if you can get someone who can keep 
up...I&#39;ve learned to like it best, as I tend to be a slow looter and in FFA that 
usually means getting left out...I usually decline to be ML tho, as I have too 
hard a time keeping up</font></div>

  <div style="FONT:10pt arial;"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] About loot 
  order</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a 
  few problems with<br>loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But 
  since I play the main<br>healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting 
  up to heal) I get<br>totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try 
  to establish alpha<br>loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the 
  casters. All they care<br>about is getting loot for themselves. These people 
  partake in<br>&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else 
  gets a<br>chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people 
  will<br>still loot out of turn.<br>And then we have times when people say we 
  roll for certain types of loot.<br>When I first joined a group, this one guy 
  told me it was ffa (and he was a<br>ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore 
  were rolled for. I saw that he<br>picked up an FS morning star and wanted to 
  roll for it (bc it&#39;s an expensive<br>item). He said no, it was only for 
  bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br>bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s 
  roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br>for bronze armor&quot;...<br>Has anyone 
  else had this problem?<br>What do you think is the best and fairest loot 
  order?<br>Just wondering.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br>ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per 
  turn (per person) works pretty well when<br>people 
  cooperate.<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
