<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771125468">Fellow EverQuest&#39;ers. I am a communications student at the <br/>
University of Washington in Seattle, WA. For a class I&#39;m taking,<br/>
I <br/>
have to write a paper about Everquest. It would REALLY help me <br/>
out if you could fill out my survey, so I can have some material in <br/>
which to write my paper. The survey is very short (it&#39;ll take <br/>
probably 2 minutes), and as if it&#39;s not already obvious, I will<br/>
not <br/>
sell any of the information I receive. My only desire is to pass the <br/>
class, and learn more about other EQ players. With that said, I <br/>
apologize if you are seeing this for a second time. I&#39;m trying to <br/>
get acquire as much data as possible, so I&#39;ve posted this same <br/>
post onto various other groups. Sorry yet thanks.  <br/>
<br/>
Our survey is located at: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sitedifference.com/edu/COM480">http://www.sitedifference.com/edu/COM480</a> . <br/>
<br/>
If you would like more info on the class I&#39;m taking, the course <br/>
website is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/redwood/com480/">http://faculty.washington.edu/redwood/com480/</a><br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much. My grade depends on you.</div>
