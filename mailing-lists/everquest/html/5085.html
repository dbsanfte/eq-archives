<div id="ygrps-yiv-618790714">Hi all i am 56 mage and as far as the the adventures go i love <br/>
them...they are great aa exp even better when a 56 mage id group with <br/>
all higher lvls i got about a yellow of aa each time and took home <br/>
about 200p. Being a poor mage always soloing i forgot what team work <br/>
is like, but you really need it in LDoN. I have won about 11 lost <br/>
about 5..and those losses resulted in fools for being in the <br/>
group..so one word of advice for people never been in lost dungen.. <br/>
bring your best friends and you will have a blast.</div>
