  since you mentioned you&#39;re on<br>a dial-up then that makes perfect 
  sense.<br><br>I used to have to do the same in PoK even with broadband. What 
  really made<br>the difference for me was the addition of a new vid card. I 
  picked up an<br>nVidia 5500 at Wal*Mart for $120 and it was well worth the 
  investment. I<br>still lag occasionally but nothing compared to what I used 
  to! <br><br>Durgaa<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>Message:

  computer takes about 5-7 minutes to load from the char select screen. 
  I<br>have 1gb ram, with an amd processor ( running win 2000 ) lol i was 
  cheap,<br>but it works. However I am on dialup, as there isnt anything faster 
  or<br>better in my area yet, tho i hear wi-fi is coming so....&lt;crossing 
  fingers&gt;.<br>The huige wait tho, sometimes longer than the actual loading, 
  is zoning into<br>PoK. It is is horribley long wait...worse if the character i 
  want to play is<br>camped there...so until there is a change..I seldom go 
  there now ort camp<br>there. I have a pocket cleric and chanter to temp/ 
  virtue and kei, me in<br>nexus, so al is good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; Tho 
  I do have an issue with PoK..am I the only one that has to run around<br>PoK 
  loking at their feet and suing the map so not to run into stuff? The 
  lag<br>there, most times ( early morn seems to be best) is very 
  bad...<br><br><br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
