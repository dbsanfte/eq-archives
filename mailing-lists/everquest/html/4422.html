&gt; SolA for 26 hours. I&#39;m generally busy healing or medding so the tanks<br/>
&gt; usually get the loot anyways. Plus I&#39;m not that aggressive about loot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there are tradeskills as well: i sold heady kiolas to get the money for<br/>
the two horses i have. i takes some time to make them and it also<br/>
may take some days to sell them (on vendor in bazaar), but it is sort<br/>
of easy money. the only drawback: you hate doing it! hint: never start<br/>
to count the clicks you have to do!<br/>
<br/>
i fill my trader with two or three bags full of heady kiola. it takes about<br/>
45 minutes to fill one bag, that&#39;s 10 stacks, eg 200 per bag. on tarew<br/>
you can set prices to 3pp to 5pp per piece. i have seen people buying<br/>
them off me instead from cheaper vendors, because i had many stacks,<br/>
and not &quot;only&quot; less then 20 on me.<br/>
<br/>
another item are some furs/pelts used for tradeskills or quests, for example<br/>
 in WW wolves drop a pelt, that is sold for 400pp to 600pp each. well,<br/>
some still ask for 1000pp for it (i believe it is used for blacksmithing).<br/>
<br/>
tradeskills got really complex! allakhazam has a nice feature showing<br/>
the full &quot;chain&quot; of items needed. for example have a look at the<br/>
recipe for a &quot;Fearful Darkly Pulsing Orb&quot;:<br/>

<br/>
the problem is: are there people around who will by this thing?<br/>
is it worth to &quot;hunt&quot; for some components which can be considered<br/>
rare drops, or are off mobs in &quot;not-so-easy-zones&quot; (not everyone<br/>
can hunt in cazic for example).<br/>
<br/>
also bazaar is somewhat &quot;ugly&quot; about prices, on the other hand<br/>
you also can be very lucky in there. let&#39;s go back to the example<br/>
from the start: one weekend (fr to mo morning) i sold about 1500<br/>
heady kiolas (and i couldn&#39;t click anymore), then it took about<br/>
5 days to sell 200 again.<br/>
<br/>
if some says, you can get an item that sells for Xpp, you still need<br/>
someone &quot;willing&quot; to buy it. also from personal experience i know<br/>
for some people having 500pp is very much, and other people<br/>
don&#39;t know if they should buy item A for 20k or item B for 30k<br/>
and make a deal to buy both items for 40k.<br/>
<br/>
when i bought my first horse (proud to be able to spent 9k) i<br/>
witnessed when a monk bought a 100k horse for his girlfriend.<br/>
nice gift indeed... could really need such friends as well... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
one more hint about bazaar: hit F9 (or was it F10) to look<br/>
from above to ground. it isn&#39;t easy to &quot;navigate&quot;, but the &quot;speed&quot;<br/>
improvement is worth it.<br/>
<br/>
another hint about gfx: i only enable &quot;new models&quot; for the chars<br/>
that have horses. all other additional features are turned off.<br/>
zoning is faster, and i have less &quot;gfx lag&quot;. i only have P3 systems<br/>
with 512MB, but that way i could play much smoother again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ooops ... i have to stop now... getting late to work, again...<br/>
