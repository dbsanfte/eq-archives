Speaking of Unrest, my guild (Fire and Brimstone,<br>Ayonae Ro) is doing a raid on Unrest this Saturday, should be fun I need to<br>replace the Bloodstained Mantle I lost in a bad trade awhile back... They<br>are doing a raid on Mistmoore tonight, but I can&#39;t loose faction with the<br>Indigo Brotherhood since I do all my business in Neriak....<br>&nbsp; Anyway, my 2cp on makin money... I checked out the guides too, I&#39;ll keep<br>doin what I&#39;ve been doin....<br><br>Steven Hulse wrote: <br><br><br>Thank you for posting this. I went to check them out and you know I have to<br>say I was a little dissapointed in the guides. A lot of the information that<br>they contain can be found at almost any EQ related website! It&#39;s basically<br>that I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay for any of these guides, it&#39;s really not worth<br>the money. The only thing I&#39;m truly interested in is making money. Man it<br>sucks trying to get some decent armor when you have no money. I&#39;ve wondered<br>about the &quot;make Plat at any level&quot; guides and I figured that you would still<br>need to group or partner at some point. <br><br>Either way I&#39;m having fun just going along and doing things the old<br>fashioned way. I do suggest going and getting these guides because there<br>were a few things in there that was nice to know about but for any player,<br>especially noobs, I suggest doing it the old fashioned way and go out there<br>and take the lumps and partner with some others. It&#39;s funner and you&#39;ll feel<br>better knowing that you did it on your own. <br><br>I got some good info about Unrest so I think I may go and try it out this<br>week. <br><br>-- <br><br>_______________________________________________<br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com/">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
