<div id="ygrps-yiv-605135694"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">As far as I know, there&#39;s only the port to the Dreadlands. &nbsp;I&#39;ve never been 
<br>there. &nbsp;My husband went the other night and was scared to death. &nbsp;He just 
<br>took off running and made it safely but how I don&#39;t know. &nbsp;Just dumb luck. &nbsp;
<br>He&#39;s a 30 mage now, was 28 then and everything he passed was conning red to 
<br>him. &nbsp;He said he will stick to the boats for a while. &nbsp;

<br>
<br>Not Dreadlands...but closer to Cabilis
<br>and without taking the barrel barge?
<br>
<br>is there anywhere else that will get me into Kunark besides one of the boats
<br>or the DL port...please
