&gt; on a less expensive &quot;weapon&quot; and where i might find<br/>
&gt; it.  I tend to hang out close to the lifts so I can<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, a FS Scimitar or War Hammer are good choices when you&#39;re <br/>
starting out.  There just aren&#39;t a lot of places to get it the GF <br/>
area.  Another option are the Frozen or Velium weapons coming out of <br/>
Velious.  I&#39;ve seen them for as little as 10 PP, and sometimes people <br/>
just give them away!<br/>
<br/>
Any Avatar I&#39;ve started in GF or BB has always done the CB belt quest <br/>
as many times as possible.  You have to load up and go see the <br/>
Dwarves, then sell any armor and weapons you don&#39;t want.  Also, <br/>
people do buy them, and if you can sneak into Crushbone you can clean <br/>
up.  Some people can&#39;t be bothered with them and will just leave them <br/>
around.  Make sure to ask unless there&#39;s nobody nearby.<br/>
<br/>
And, since I assume you are one of those cute little Wood Elf Druids <br/>
just flirt a little and all those big Warriors will fall all over <br/>
themselves to help you out! I know I would!  LOL  <br/>
