<div id="ygrps-yiv-533851691"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;True. What I hate is when people dont&#39; realize I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;kiting something and decide to &quot;help&quot; me by killing<br/>
&gt;the things chasing me. Happens all the time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honestly I haven&#39;t had a problem with that in quite a<br/>
while... I do try to avoid the idiot-heavy zones<br/>
though. Closest thing i&#39;ve had happen was when i&#39;d<br/>
just started Root &#39;n Rotting a MOB, stacked the snare,<br/>
root and DOT, then a melee came along and started<br/>
whacking it...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, the bear skins are ok if you aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;roleplaying and decide it&#39;s ok for a druid to be<br/>
&gt;killing bears. I personally don&#39;t kill bears or<br/>
&gt;wolves with my druid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I want to roleplay, I show up at the local Vampire:<br/>
The Masquerade LARP. ;) If I want to run around and<br/>
whack things for experience, I play EQ. :) I long ago<br/>
gave up on even remotely considering EQ a RPG...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;However, if you can make it through Paludal Caverns<br/>
&gt;and get to Shadeweaver&#39;s Thicket in one piece, there<br/>
&gt;are tons of rockhopper hides.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, found out about that a few days after Luclin<br/>
came out, still haven&#39;t gone up there to try it out...<br/>
Got a strong aversion to Luclin mostly due to how<br/>
poorly it ran when I went up there the first few<br/>
times. ;) (also I tend to be a creature of habit,<br/>
sticking to zones I know :)<br/>
