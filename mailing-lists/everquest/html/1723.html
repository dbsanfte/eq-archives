<b>Subject:</b> Whats up with kill stealing???? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-109621440">Hi everyone!<br/>
  What is up with the kill stealing? I&#39;ve had it<br/>
happen to me several times where I was soloing and<br/>
after killing several creatures, (Getting attacked one<br/>
right after another), I&#39;ll find that while I&#39;m<br/>
fighting off an attacker my other kills have been<br/>
stolen. Sometimes I&#39;ll even see them do it. Granted<br/>
I&#39;ve gone up to some other players kills after a time<br/>
mistaking it for one of mine but I mean blatently<br/>
going up and stealing a kill right in front of the<br/>
original player? <br/>
<br/>
That really sucks!<br/>
C-ya!<br/>
