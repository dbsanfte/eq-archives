<div id="ygrps-yiv-343810969">I will generally ask for a sow in /ooc or /shout (shout only if really<br/>
really desperate-- with an offer to donate).<br/>
But I don&#39;t go looking for a specific person. I&#39;ll just ask &quot;Can anyone cast<br/>
sow?&quot; If someone says yes I ask them politely. If they say they don&#39;t have<br/>
mana or are too busy I say &quot;Ok, thanks anyways&quot;.<br/>
luv,<br/>
