<div><font size="2">It doesn&#39;t really bother me my first character was a mage and 
he leveled just fine without KEI. I make it a practice to really learn how to 
play my characters. I never looked for an uber buff like KEI or 
Aego/Virtue&nbsp; to me the game is much more fun that way. </font></div>

  feel?</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>DUe to the frequent changes sony/varent has induced into 
  this game <br>such as revamping some perfectly fine zones and make them harder 
  than <br>orginaly, and swiping c3 and even c2 from our collective grasp, my 
  <br>famley members who play this game will be writing sony and they will 
  <br>shortly and most likely <br>be quiting this game, which in effect may lead 
  to my defection as <br>well due to the incressing dificulty of this so call 
  &quot;class balancing&quot;<br>now mind you this is total horse shit on sonys part, and 
  they are <br>taking all the fun and adventur out of this game by making every 
  <br>thing totaly impossible and un reachable, now i know not every one 
  <br>feels like this but not every one is a druid who with out c3 can <br>cast 
  no more that 3 spells with out haveing to sit for 20 minets and 
  <br>meddititing for example<br><br>What im asking my fellow everquest players 
  and there friends is for <br>there suport in the effort we are trying to get 
  sony to see, that <br>they are systematicly desimating a game that once was 
  fun and <br>enjoyable. Once this letter is writin i will have it in <br>the 
  forums here with sonys email which we have directed these coments.<br>We would 
  appriciate the suport of our fellow gamers and friends if <br>they too would 
  also after that time email sony and the like with <br>their concers and grips- 
  please once this is posted consider our <br>request as some one has to fight 
  back again the few who decide they <br>need to nerf our spells, our strengh 
  and our fun in this game <br><br>I will be posting the letter and the email 
  address as soon as it is <br>made aviabel and i will be posting this accross 
  as many forums as i <br>can find hoping to fight back against the evil that is 
  the everquest <br>managemnt. <br>thank you for taking your time to read
