<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132124600">Hi there everyone. I posted this over on the forum at Sorcerors.Net <br/>
originally and have decided to post this here<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to play the game w/o going online? Probably not, I&#39;d <br/>
say. But I&#39;ve seen some gamecards being sold at EB etc which allows <br/>
ppl to play w/o credit cards so I&#39;m tempted to install it. But some <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
1- What are the Rangers like?<br/>
2- Can thieves backstab? If so, do they fade out like in the <br/>
Infinity Engine D&D games? would the enemy player (being attacked) <br/>
be able to dodge?<br/>
3- What are some of other classes like?<br/>
4- Is it REALLY that addictive?<br/>
<br/>
