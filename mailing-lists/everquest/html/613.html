<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068903921">As long as the gloves I am wearing say MAGIC ITEM, that means I can punch<br/>
something and it can do magic attack, right?<br/>
Just wonderin cause I bought a Blackened Sapphire and I&#39;m getting a Skull of<br/>
jhenn tra soon then later on a jeweled skul and I was thinking put my dirk<br/>
in throwing slot cause mana is what we&#39;re about, right?</div>
