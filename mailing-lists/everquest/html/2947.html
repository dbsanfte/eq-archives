<div id="ygrps-yiv-207181873">1. You can Solo with different chars not all are<br/>
designed for this. You can always find someone to play<br/>
with usually.  10-15 hours per week is fine, Trust me,<br/>
if you can find the time, this will<br/>
increase....heheheh<br/>
   HOW IT WORKS - well you make a char and set out for<br/>
adventure , there are lots of quests but get out and<br/>
kill BADDIES.....Like I said, you can solo but you<br/>
will group and want to for certain things. Sometimes I<br/>
just like to jump on and Fletch arrows, so I sit in a<br/>
town and Craft away.<br/>
<br/>
2.  YES IT IS<br/>
<br/>
3.  I have a P2 500 with 316 MB RAM and a 32MB card I<br/>
run the EQ trilogy and it runs ok, yours will be fine.<br/>
 Don&#39;t get LUCLIN since the system will run slow. I<br/>
have put it on mine and can play but it is TOO slow<br/>
for my liking.  The trilogy gives you enough zones and<br/>
equipment to keep you busy for a while. There is<br/>
plenty to do and see. NORRATH is HUGE.<br/>
<br/>
4. Already touched this point.<br/>
<br/>
MOST OF all, ENJOY, and trust me you will, it is a<br/>
BLAST.<br/>
<br/>
LET US KNOW what server you choose to play on, <br/>
<br/>
I play on Druzzil RO<br/>
<br/>
Later<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi all, <br/>
&gt; Having been a fan of computer RPG&#39;s for years I am<br/>
&gt; considering trying <br/>
&gt; EQ. Having never played an online rpg before I have<br/>
&gt; a few questions ?<br/>
&gt; (Forgive my lack of knowledge and feel free to laugh<br/>
&gt; at my questions)<br/>
&gt; 1. Being used to playing solo games I could pretty<br/>
&gt; much play at my <br/>
&gt; own pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other<br/>
&gt; online players but <br/>
&gt; seeing as I am a casual gamer i only spend  10-15<br/>
&gt; hours a week gaming <br/>
&gt; is this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play<br/>
&gt; occurs with whoever <br/>
&gt; is online at the time and am I not tied into a<br/>
&gt; specific group/times.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join<br/>
&gt; with? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kharnak,<br/>
&gt; etc) does it <br/>
&gt; matter which one I start with or are the later<br/>
&gt; addons geared for <br/>
&gt; higher level characters.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the<br/>
&gt; system requirements <br/>
&gt; but what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866,<br/>
&gt; 128sdram, 32mb ddr nvidia <br/>
&gt; geforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or<br/>
&gt; should I wait <br/>
&gt; till I upgrade.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any feedback <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
