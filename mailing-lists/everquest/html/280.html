The spamming works..<br/>
<br/>
Allow the spamming to continue until you no longer get the &quot;your language<br/>
skill has approved&quot; message.  You wont see any changes to your skills<br/>
listing until you zone.  It seems that the person that is teaching you   <br/>
must<br/>
have excellent skill for that language.  Hope that helps.  Currently i   <br/>
know<br/>
21 different languages..  im only excellent in Eurdin, Old Eurdin, Elfish<br/>
and Barbarian..  the rest i can only ask where the bathroom in.. hehe<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>

Has anyone had any luck with teaching them to another player? I went   <br/>
ahead<br/>
and trained in several, and now I have 11 different languages, this   <br/>
includes<br/>
<br/>
Common and Elf. Do you need to put more than one point in it to learn it<br/>
from someone else? Or to teach it to someone else? I grouped with someone   <br/>
<br/>
that wanted to work on it, so we gave it a try. Made a key that said   <br/>
several<br/>
<br/>
lines to the group and spammed each other. I saw the blue message that   <br/>
your<br/>
language skills have improved several times but did not seem to see any<br/>
change in the language on the skill list. Also, when I right click to   <br/>
change<br/>
<br/>
what language that I am talking in and click the choice to scroll threw<br/>
them, Dark Elf shows up on the list of choices, but when I look at my   <br/>
skill<br/>
list it is not there. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
