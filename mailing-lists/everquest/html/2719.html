 </span></blockquote>IMHO anything better than a geforce2, doesn&#39;t make things look better<br/>
playing EQ, just much faster, or even make it playable.<br/>
<br/>
i think there aren&#39;t any special routines that really take advantage<br/>
or even use the &quot;special&quot; features of the &quot;big&quot; geforce cards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but i am happy that i switched to a &quot;geforce 3 ti 500&quot; now, because i<br/>
<br/>
used a &quot;geforce 2&quot; (one of the first cards on the market, so it is<br/>
really old :) and there were some luclin zones, i almost couldn&#39;t play<br/>
at all. well, i could move in that zones, but after switching almost<br/>
everything off ... and i didn&#39;t like the look of it.<br/>
<br/>
what i really hate, is to have the clip-plane at it&#39;s minimum. in some<br/>
zones you think it is night all the time. or you can&#39;t even find your<br/>
way around. just try this: go to katta bank, stand on the steps there<br/>
and face the stairs. then play around with the clip plane settings!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
currently i play another online game again: Asheron&#39;s Call. what i<br/>
really love about their game engine, even if it doesn&#39;t look this<br/>
good like EQ (i am talking about AC1, NOT AC2), it runs very fast<br/>
even on my P2/300 with a TNT2 card at 1024x768.<br/>
<br/>
i played &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; and was in the beta of &quot;Neocron&quot;: the gfx<br/>
is very good - sometimes i prefer AO&#39;s to EQ&#39;s ! - and they don&#39;t<br/>
eat up all of your ressources. IMHO the verant people can do and they<br/>
should really start to work on building up a better gfx engine.<br/>
i mean it is just crazy to demand from the users to use P4s and<br/>
geforce 4 cards, when others can do superb gfx with P2/P3 based<br/>
systems and a TNT2 or geforce 2.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
have fun<br/>
