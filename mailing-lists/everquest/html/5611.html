<div>Well first you have to make sure you have the expansion Lost Dungeons of Norath, once you have that then you join a band of adventures of around your level, maximum of 6 member with a spread of no more then 7 levels between the highest and lowest. The group leader then goes and gets the adventure for the group, sorry but they won&#39;t let a solo in and you all have to have the expansion enabled and have your adventure stones. Just one way they have of making you group with people to have fun and see naked as someone possibly all of you will die on it at some time or another. You&#39;ll have a main looter who loots and then sells after the adventure and splits the proceeds between you all, items drop from the mobs which are no drops and you roll on them, there&#39;s also some pretty nice things drop that you&#39;ll want to roll on.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div><tt>I haven&#39;t played in months. Just got back in a couple days ago. My<br>Halfling Druid lvl 42 returned to Rivervale, and I got this whispered<br>message to meet a NPC. I had seen the message before, but since I had<br>nothing else going on, I responded. As a result I went searching for a<br>camp of adventurers. I talked to whom I had been directed to, and was<br>encouraged to go on missions for them. However, I haven&#39;t found anyone<br>in the camp in Butcherblock nor the camp in East Commonlands who will<br>give me a mission. Anyone know about this Adventure business, or some<br>place I can look?<br><br>Oh, it was sure interesting spending the night in East Commonlands. It<br>used to be lowbee heaven, but I found myself actually fighting for my<br>life and wondering if I might actually have to run. It was rather fun.<br>A positive change.<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br>42nd season Halfling Druid.<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br>
