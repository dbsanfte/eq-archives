<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; At 18, I was in LOIO, but SK, Oasis, and 
Lake Rathe are good too.&nbsp; The key to soloing a ranger is to pick and choose 
your kills.&nbsp; They almost always have to be blue cons.&nbsp; Heal and med 
between kills.&nbsp; In Lake Rathe, the best place to go until 20 is Jonas, a 
monk hermit.&nbsp; Make sure you snare him when pulling.&nbsp; He is a 
consistent level 14 or 15 spawn on about a 6 minute timer.&nbsp; In LOIO, stay 
near the beach, and use track to find the blues to kill.&nbsp; Experience will 
tell you which mobs hit harder than others, for about the same amount of xp 
gained.&nbsp; Oasis, kill dervs, if you can split them, orcs, or gators.&nbsp; 
There is also Crushbone, camping the legionnaires.&nbsp; Befallen, on the second 
level.&nbsp; Blackburrow, camping the high level mobs in there.&nbsp; Unrest, in 
the courtyard, but stay near the walls when medding, due to trains.&nbsp; Upper 
Guk, The Warrens, and Najena are good too.&nbsp; There are lots of options at 
your level, it just takes a bit of experimentation to find the area you like 
best, if soloing.&nbsp; SK, LOIO, and Unrest will take you to 30, 
easily.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; In groups, agro control is very important, 
as odds are that you will not have as much AC as that tank you are working 
with.&nbsp; Backing off of the mob for a sec or two, not casting on the mob as 
often, and not hitting that taunt button are effective for agro control.&nbsp; 
If the mob turns and smacks you only every once in a while, then you are right 
where you need to be, since just as soon as that cleric over heals, or the 
caster nukes too much, the mob will be on them, and you&#39;ll need to cast, and 
taunt to pull them back off the healer/caster that overdid it.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; Grouping a ranger at the lower levels can at 
times be frustrating, as unless a couple people in the group are playing lower 
level alts, people don&#39;t quite understand how a ranger fits into the grouping 
scheme.&nbsp; This does fade, however, so should not be taken personally.&nbsp; 
The good news is, that if you tend to solo more than group, you can easily solo 
a ranger all the way to 60, if you want to.&nbsp; It just takes a bit of 
patience, and knowing where to go.</font></div>
