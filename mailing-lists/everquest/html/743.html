 Was anyone online during the DE war last night.. What did you think of it<br/>
 all?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah I was.  A pitiful GM event for sure.  They organized an event that thier <br/>
Hardware could not support.  Entire servers crashing, zones crashing, random <br/>
disconnects, random zone teleports.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of people were complaining about how hard it was to kill them and how <br/>
the zones were huge massacre areas, even for high lvl groups (I don&#39;t really <br/>
have a problem with this, a war is a war and if it is a hard one to survive <br/>
that&#39;s ok with me).  People were also losing tons of experience as the NPCs <br/>
were camped at people&#39;s bind respawn spots - (a friend of mine lost 3 bubbles <br/>
before he turned off his machine to stop respawning).  We organized an army <br/>
outside HH PASS to retake the zone - about 40 players grouped up - after <br/>
getting organized and planning our attack - we zone in and I disconnected (I <br/>
assume many others did as well).  I tried to get back on for an hour, but <br/>
since I was now inside HH Pass, I could not log in.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks VERANT!  - That was soooooo much fun<br/>
