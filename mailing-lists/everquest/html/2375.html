<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087242476">It&#39;s an error 1001, saying there was a failure to connect to the <br/>
login server. I get those if I try to log in while there is a patch <br/>
going on. Once it happened after a patch and I was locked out for two <br/>
days until another patch was run. Good thing it does not occur often. <br/>
Got email in to sony. Anoying, as I had set aside several hours to <br/>
quest today and found them wasted.<br/>
<br/>
Guess I will play an alternate game. Spent the day hunting sites for <br/>
good stuff to quest for. Sony should no better than to frustrate <br/>
their addicts. Not smart. There are other dealers on the street.<br/>
