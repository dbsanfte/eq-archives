<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359283754">At your level, farm grikbar fur and teeth in Steamfont. It&#39;s not super cash,<br/>
but at your level it&#39;s respectable enough. With halfway decent cha the fur<br/>
goes for nearly 1 PP a tuft, and the teeth for about 1/3 a PP. I managed to<br/>
get 25 PP from lvl 5 to 8 with my froggie warrior here without even trying.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi, everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve only been playing EQ a few months, and I have a ranger on Tarew Marr<br/>
&gt; who has just made 12th level and a warrior who&#39;s at 3rd level. I keep<br/>
&gt; looking for strategies for each character all over the Web, but one thing<br/>
&gt; eludes me. Of course, that&#39;s making platinum. I keep seeing all these<br/>
books<br/>
&gt; for sale on how to make platinum easily and quickly, but I keep writing<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; off as scams. Are there any half-decent methods for growing wealthier?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
