<div id="ygrps-yiv-951440114">I haven&#39;t been able to get on much either so I don&#39;t know. I do know they have added veterans awards so that if you&#39;ve played for a certain amount of time you get bonus features. I think my favorite is an AA that lets you get double xp for about 30min once a day.<br/>
