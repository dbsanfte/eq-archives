<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424448421">Hi, I&#39;m a level  9 Euridite Magician and it seems like it takes me <br/>
forever to level.  What am I doing wrong (if anything).  Maybe it <br/>
just takes a long time for magicians to level?  Biltilie, I see that <br/>
on you profile pic that you are carrying a book. What is that book?  <br/>
I already have a stein which brings my charisma up a lot. I just want <br/>
to play the game to it&#39;s full potential.  So far, I&#39;ve been having a <br/>
ball playing!  It&#39;s become an obsession..lol</div>
