<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004251048">The last patch axed pottery completely, none of the items<br/>
can come close to breaking even let alone make a profit.<br/>
<br/>
This has been &quot;compensated&quot; for by allowing potters to<br/>
make the material components for create poison.<br/>
<br/>
Given some of the vial sketches cost upwards of 1plat<br/>
create poison is going to be an expensive skill.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I tried pottery myself, I ran my ass off and I am quite fast with the<br/>
mouse clicking items around, and I never got more than 40p per hour,<br/>
which means that I make more money fighting things with my level 23<br/>
paladin. But sure, you can &quot;cheat&quot; like this, I imagine that if you have<br/>
the patience, you can be wearing steel plate and wield a well balanced<br/>
sword within a month of a new server opening, with a level 10<br/>
character.. But the pottery you would have to do would take SOOO much<br/>
time.. It will bore you to death not to mention give your fingers<br/>
cramps.. ;) I estimate if you do it well you can have full set of steel<br/>
plate and a wb sword in about 75 realtime hours of pottery.. If you<br/>
really want to &quot;cheat&quot; like this, and spend the time required to do it,<br/>
I feel VERY sorry for you.. ;) But then again there are those that play<br/>
over 10h per day(I feel sorry for them already;), they can be wearing<br/>
this set of nice items in about a week and a half..</div>
