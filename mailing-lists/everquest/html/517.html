<div id="ygrps-yiv-440116257">I have yet to see this area, but since you describe it as a shrine it may be<br/>
one of the portals to the planes.  Possibly.  Though is sounds a tad weakly<br/>
guarded to be a portal ( the portal for the plane of hate is guarded by 6<br/>
Spectres and a level 41ish Necro ).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>
