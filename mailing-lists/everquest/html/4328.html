&gt; You wouldn&#39;t believe the number of people who have asked for help finding<br/>
&gt; the Registrar in Shar Vahl. It&#39;s hard to explain where she is, but I will<br/>
&gt; try. Lets start with the bridge that leads to the thicket zone, not the<br/>
&gt; hollow... there are two bridges. Standing on the bridge to the thicket,<br/>
run<br/>
&gt; into the city. Pass the black female vender - do NOT turn left or right,<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; straight past her. Then turn right. There is a little passage that looks<br/>
&gt; like a tunnel. Go through that. You will then turn up in a little market<br/>
&gt; square. The Registrar is in one of the rooms in the square. I know it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; confusing, but that is the best way I can explain it. Let me know if you<br/>
&gt; need any more help.<br/>
Actually..you missed a little...you don&#39;t even turn right after going by<br/>
her...the Regsitrar is in the building straight ahead through the unmarked<br/>
door.  Thats what confuses a bunch of people, that a worker for the local<br/>
goverment is working in an unmarked building that is  for the<br/>
people....everyone else is in very visible buildings...))<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As for my favorite race and class to play... well, my main is a druid, but<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; like to do a little fighting as well. I am also fond of pets and being<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; to turn myself into another form. Because there is no class that does all<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; that, I can&#39;t say I have a favorite. I enjoy my beastlord though. I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; say what my favorite race is either... halflings are adorable, but I also<br/>
&gt; like Vah Shirs. However, I can&#39;t wait for Frogloks to come out!<br/>
<br/>
I play Vah Shir a lot and have that city memorized very well.  But will be<br/>
playing the frogs when they come out.  If anyone needs info on where a<br/>
certain NPC in Shar Vahl is, send me an email and i&#39;ll let you know where<br/>
you can find them.  That city gets way too confusing for a lot of people.<br/>
