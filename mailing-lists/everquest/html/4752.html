<div id="ygrps-yiv-613743175">I agree it is hard but c3 and c2 truly unbalance the game a young <br/>
chanter had no chance to group.  No one needed you it also took away <br/>
from bards as mana batteries.  I am glad they balanced it.  The <br/>
reason you are upset with your toon is its off the crack and feeling <br/>
the shock of withdrawal.  Suck it up and learn to play your toon.  <br/>
You will be glad you did later.  Its easy to play any class if its <br/>
twinked out or buffed to the hilt.  Find a class you like buck naked <br/>
and unbuffed thats where you will be happy in the long haul.  For me <br/>
it was the Monk and Beastlord. A good place to try all the classes is <br/>
on the test server do the test buff and bam your 25 with decent gear.<br/>
                  PS. For those of you with an eye for grammer and <br/>
spelling, what can I say but enjoy =O`  /wink<br/>
