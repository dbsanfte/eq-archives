<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655108732">I had been playing EQ for about a week, and a Dark Elf lady walked up <br/>
behind me, gave me some buffs, and gave me a Smoldering Brand. I <br/>
asked what it was and she said &quot;You can use it, or sell it and get <br/>
good money&quot;. I thanked the lady to death! Later when I went to the <br/>
bank to put the brand in there, I also noticed that she had given me <br/>
600PP! Another Dark Elf asked me if I&#39;d go into the Herb Jar in S. <br/>
Qeynos and buy a spell for her. When I did, she gave me a Runed <br/>
Circlet. A Warrior asked me to do the same thing, and he gave me <br/>
buffs and 5PP. I have been pretty lucky in that aspect.<br/>
<br/>
With the money, I have been trying to buy items to boost my <br/>
intelligence, and I&#39;ve been trying to buy things to help my sister, a <br/>
Level 10 Mage out too. Can anyone give me suggestion on what to buy? <br/>
Last night I ran across a Karana&#39;s Tear Earring for 91PP and a Polar <br/>
Bear Robe for 6GP for myself; and a Magi&#39;??? Earring for 50PP for my <br/>
sister. Where these good prices for these items? And what else do <br/>
y&#39;all suggest might help me gain intelligence?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch<br/>
