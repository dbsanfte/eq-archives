&gt; Like the subject of this message says, I am quite bummed out, by the mere<br/>
&gt; fact that I have yet to receive a copy of the game. I live in sweden and<br/>
&gt; preordered the game about one week before the end of beta phase 4, now I<br/>
&gt; have ordered it from 4 places both domestic(one being the largest comp.<br/>
&gt; game distributor in sweden) and foreign. But I still haven&#39;t received the<br/>
&gt; game. Now I am active reader on eqvault as well as participate in mailing<br/>
&gt; lists, and this is REALLY annoying. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve had some extra<br/>
&gt; time thinking about what class/race I will play.. And if I don&#39;t get the<br/>
&gt; game within 2 weeks from now I&#39;m gonna give up and buy Ultima or<br/>
&gt; something, but then again, I would have to kill myself.. :p<br/>
&gt; - Avron - Totally BUMMED right now! :(<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just carry on, bummed guy.<br/>
It&#39;s worth it.<br/>
