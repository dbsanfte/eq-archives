<div>&nbsp;Today I had to download 4 different drivers for my graphics card before they were happy with my configuration and would let me play on my main computer. My laptop, less then one year old, is still unable to get on as the card is no longer supported. When I finally did get through to tech support I was told by one of their &quot;experienced tech support personnel &quot; that my backup computer is a dinosaur and unable to use their game any more... it&#39;s 2 years old but the graphics card is what&#39;s holding it up. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hmm choices, decisions, should I use my back up computer with the slow processor to run my business, my laptop which my husband uses in his semi truck so it&#39;s usually at the other side of the country, my business computer to play around on and hope the IRS don&#39;t find out about the deduction I&#39;ve claimed,&nbsp;or should I just tell EQ what I think of them and cancel all our accounts? Bah going to kill skellies while I think about this, not a happy beasty right now</div>

<div><br></div><tt>Hello,<br><br>We have DirectX 9 with all the latest graphics card drivers. Today <br>Everquest auto downloaded the DX9 patch, and that has slowed EQ down <br>to the point where it is virtually unusable.<br><br>Has anyone else seen this, and is there anything that can be done <br>about it?<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br></tt></span></blockquote></div>
