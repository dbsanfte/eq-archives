<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365834951">Oh hey, sweet! Finally somebody else who plays on Tarew Marr server. :)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t really experienced the LDoN problems that you&#39;re talking about,<br/>
but I don&#39;t tend to do many LDoN adventures anymore unless friends are<br/>
online. Then, even if it&#39;s just three of us, we might just do an adventure<br/>
without recruiting a full team (we win about 3/4 of the time with a<br/>
three-person team, but certain types of adventures are nearly impossible,<br/>
like assassinations).<br/>
<br/>
My biggest complaint is the insistence of far too many players that an LDoN<br/>
group absolutely needs a cleric in the mix. I&#39;ve wasted more hours than I<br/>
care to count sitting there with a perfectly-suitable five-person group just<br/>
because the group refuses to budge without a cleric. Not fun at all. X(<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you want, look me up on Tarew Marr server. My main, a 45th level<br/>
ranger, is named Crispinus.<br/>

Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I would introduce myself. My name is<br/>
Cary. I&#39;m 25 years old married. Both my husband and I<br/>
play EQ. He is the one that got me hooked.<br/>
<br/>
My Characters:<br/>
Venetia Valgrave - Lvl 43 Ench High elf - Currently<br/>
gaining exp to dungeon groups and not liking it<br/>
<br/>
Clawdya Valgrave Lvl 23 - Beastlord Kitty - Currently<br/>
in PC<br/>
<br/>
I play on the the Tarew Marr server with my husband<br/>
Morrdak Valgrave who is a lvl 52 Iksar SK. Also a<br/>
bunch of My RL friends play on that server. We all<br/>
have the family name of Valgrave. Its pretty funny.<br/>
Hehe<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to level to 46 as quickly as possible so I<br/>
can level in POJ with my friends who are in their 50&#39;s<br/>
now. It sucks not being able to level with them. The<br/>
Dungeon groups suck because everybody is sooo rude and<br/>
I have been jipped out of split 4 times now.<br/>
<br/>
Well I just thought I would introduce myself!<br/>
<br/>
Cary</div>
