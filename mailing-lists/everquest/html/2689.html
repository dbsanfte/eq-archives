&gt; &gt; I am sure there are some good ranger 2-hand blunt weapons out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes there are.  But the problem with 2hb is that there are so many better<br/>
&gt; weapons for the other weapons types that you rarely find a good 2hb to<br/>
work<br/>
&gt; up your skill until the later levels.  I have 200+ skill in 1 and 2hs,<br/>
1hb,<br/>
&gt; and piercing but I&#39;ve never found a 2hb weapon that I could raise skill<br/>
&gt; with.  Maybe I&#39;ll get lucky and win a roll on a Woodsman&#39;s staff one day<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; be able to use that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are good 2hb weapons......it&#39;s just that there are so many other<br/>
&gt; better weapons that are easier to get.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I started practicing 2hb in my 20&#39;s with a Buryani Leg ripper I bought<br/>
of a player for about 50pp... Fear kiting animals is a good way to get<br/>
skill-ups with odd weapons, as it is fairly safe to do solo so you don&#39;t<br/>
feel a fool in front of other players with the amount of misses you get to<br/>
begin with.<br/>
<br/>
Then I moved on to a Froglok Crusher, then a Drakkel Forged Sledgehammer<br/>
(these can be bought off vendor for about 110pp if a player has sold one to<br/>
the vendor), and now a Drakkel Icegrinder. My 2hb is currently at 186 at<br/>
level 47, and it would be maxed but I hardly used it  from 35 to 45 as I was<br/>
leveling in a hurry in Dawnshroud.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my weapon skills at 47 are 1hs, 1hb, piercing all 200, 2hs 190, 2hb<br/>
186. I expect to max both 2h before 50.<br/>
