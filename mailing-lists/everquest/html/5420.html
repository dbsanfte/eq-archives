<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395974434">Did a lot of searching the web and learned a lot more about EQ.  I can play<br/>
CDs with my hot keys now and my social hot keys include the targets name.<br/>
One thing I have not been able to find, is how people put items in their<br/>
messages so you can click on them to see the specs.  Like when somebody says<br/>
&quot;WTS a Sword.&quot; and the word Sword is in a different color and when you click<br/>
on it you see the stats.</div>
