<br/>
heres a short description.<br/>
<br/>
if you use any of the filtering options like others damage off, npc spells<br/>
off, my misses or whatever you should use /serverfilter on to prevent the<br/>
server from sending this data to your client. else this info gets propagated<br/>
over your (possibly very thin) wire and flood your pc with things that the<br/>
client itself discards as you choose to filter that info out. This helps ...<br/>
a lot in raid situations with 30+ people and low bandwidth users.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if youre on dsl or any other (relatively) highspeed<br/>
connection the file datarate.txt in your eq directory is set wrong. Its<br/>
tuned by verant for a modem user. What this file does is preventing the<br/>
server from overloading your client with too much data causing linkdeaths<br/>
when you can no longer recieve enough info, this tends to happen when zoning<br/>
or when someone uses a lag intensive spell (sentinel, ae rains and so on).<br/>
The Verant setting is 5.0 in the file. If youre on dsl turn this up to 9.0<br/>
(max)<br/>
<br/>
This will reduce the lag you get by letting your client recieve more updates<br/>
since you have more bandwidth. this will make you much more responsive and<br/>
not having a nasty 30 secs msglag when someone is asking for a heal or a<br/>
buff or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
More is in the manual or on the everquest messageboards at everquest.com.<br/>
Read the technical information.<br/>

Please direct me to where I can learn more about serverfilter and<br/>
datarate.txt modifications.  That was a new one to me!<br/>
