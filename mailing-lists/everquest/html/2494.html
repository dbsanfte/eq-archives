<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745165724">Yup. I have a special wire just for modems. Brand new. Was connecting at 24k<br/>
before. Now max is 26k.<br/>
It&#39;s because I&#39;m being a slick. Basically the phone company was lazy and<br/>
rather than giving me a full phone line, they set up a slick where they<br/>
spliced up existing lines and spread them out among houses in my area. So we<br/>
only get partial lines and low bandwidth. I talked to my ISP and they first<br/>
suggested I was behind a slick. When a repairman for my phone company came<br/>
out he confirmed that we&#39;re behind a slick. Said that the bandwidth was<br/>
within &quot;acceptible&quot; limits. When I asked the phone company about being taken<br/>
out from behind the slick they didn&#39;t know what one was. After I explained<br/>
they denied that I was behind one. I told them that I had been informed by<br/>
someone who worked on the phone lines that I was and that he even told me<br/>
the location of the slick. So I have 10 miles of spliced lines. Hell, when<br/>
they worked on my neighbors lines they turned off my caller ID, call<br/>
waiting, and disabled my main phone line for 3 days. Well, the line wasn&#39;t<br/>
working for 3 days. it kept saying it was busy bc they mixed it up with my<br/>
neighbors. the call waiting and caller ID still aren&#39;t working. I&#39;m trying<br/>
to find some type of solution to get decent lines. But I can&#39;t even get TV<br/>
out where I live-- or get my road paved. so I&#39;m probably out of luck.<br/>
Sorry for the rant.<br/>
luv,<br/>

Have you tried replacing your modem wire? The one that plugs into the wall?<br/>
They can go bad, and it&#39;s a cheap fix that can help sometimes on a &quot;noisy&quot;<br/>
line, if nothing else is really noisy (like the phone).<br/>

  &gt; there are hints about the bandwidth EQ needs on the official EQ site,<br/>
  &gt; but it is somewhat hard to find ... it is sort of information for ISPs<br/>
  &gt; so they know how much traffic within an hour or so can occur playing<br/>
  &gt; this game.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Well, when I was connecting around 40k we could have 3 people on at the<br/>
same<br/>
  time and not have lag too badly.<br/>
  but our phone lines here just suck so bad. We can barely hear over the<br/>
phone<br/>
  but the phone company keeps saying there&#39;s nothing wrong with our lines.<br/>
  Not that I&#39;m bitter mind you. ;-)<br/>
  luv,<br/>
