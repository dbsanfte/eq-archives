<div id="ygrps-yiv-548868944">I&#39;m currently trying to get my druid high enough to sow. Hopefully I&#39;ll have<br/>
enough mana to sow once I get to that lvl.<br/>
luv,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; ahh yes.. the ub3r d00ds of our great land.. such a<br/>
&gt; &gt; travesty.. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i don&#39;t mind giving sows.. i often sit at home by<br/>
&gt; &gt; the PoD lift and buff.. but a &quot;thank you, m&#39;Lady&quot; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; always welcome.. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;nods&gt; I try to do the same when I have a little<br/>
&gt; downtime to kill. I often go to GFay to buy stacks of<br/>
&gt; Spiderling Silks, usually park myself at newbie lift<br/>
&gt; and give SoW&#39;s and whatnot. Same deal in EC tunnel.<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s really starting to bug me is the number of<br/>
&gt; Druids (and other classes for that matter) being<br/>
&gt; downright stingy with things like SoW. I mean,<br/>
&gt; nobody&#39;s obligated to give them out, but at least for<br/>
&gt; me access to SoW was one of the primary reasons for<br/>
&gt; playing a Druid, I don&#39;t mind sharing it cause I know<br/>
&gt; how good it feels to be on the recieving end of one.<br/>
&gt; (playing my rogue is maddening until some kind soul<br/>
&gt; decides to SoW me, gods I need JBoots :) When<br/>
&gt; something as simple as a laughably tiny amount of mana<br/>
&gt; that will be recovered in two seconds of medding can<br/>
&gt; enhance another person&#39;s gaming experience that much,<br/>
&gt; I see it as a bargain. Plus, more often than not, for<br/>
&gt; every ten or so SoW&#39;s I give out, I get a Clarity in<br/>
&gt; exchange, or someone cuts me a deal on an item, or<br/>
&gt; some other nicety. (had one guy give me a HQ Bear Pelt<br/>
&gt; last night just because I SoWed him :) In a way I also<br/>
&gt; view it as my contribution to the community as a<br/>
&gt; whole. People have been very generous and helpful so<br/>
&gt; far, it&#39;s the least I can do to give back a little. :)<br/>
