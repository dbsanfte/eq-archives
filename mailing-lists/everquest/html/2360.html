<div id="ygrps-yiv-909272539">Jeff Gaurdry said &quot;Shows how much I go to Luclin. (worst expansion yet? in a<br/>
word... YES.)<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t rate the expansion from best to worst. Every expansion offers<br/>
something new. The high lights for the latest expansion is the new world<br/>
graphics, character graphics, alternative advancement skills and more new<br/>
zones added than ever before. Now to class this as the worst expansion ever<br/>
might be your personal view, but I can guarantee that eyes on Verant and<br/>
many of their customers, it was the best expansion ever. <br/>
<br/>
The alternative advancement skills are one of the best things Verant could<br/>
have come up with. There is no telling how many accounts would have been<br/>
canceled if there was no way of building / leveling your character after you<br/>
hit level 60. The AA alone is the biggest A+ they could have done. The new<br/>
world graphics are great when you compare what EQ use to look like before. I<br/>
have mixed feelings on the new character models, some I like and other ok,<br/>
but in general, I like the new models.<br/>
<br/>
But I believe this was the worst expansion when it comes to functions<br/>
working properly on release date. Too many things went wrong on release date<br/>
to mention. Broken quests, loot table all messed up with your normal 3 day<br/>
after release they patch the loot table fixes. But looking at the big<br/>
picture, I can&#39;t really blame Verant for the holding the release date and<br/>
sticking to it. Everyone is out to make money. Releasing SoL just before<br/>
Christmas was ideal for to get those extra sales for new EQ accounts. On the<br/>
other hand, I do blame them for not beta testing SoL hard enough. Hire an<br/>
extra dozen personnel, work 16 hour shifts, do everything possible to make<br/>
the release date as smooth as possible. Smooth, it was not.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up my point, it is hard to call one expansion over another the worst.<br/>
When it comes to content, expansion 2 was better than 3 or expansion 3<br/>
release was a lot worse than all others. It is really hard for me to single<br/>
out any one of the expansions and call it the worst. IMHO they all have<br/>
their good points and bad, and SoV had way too many good points for me to<br/>
down on it.<br/>

	it&#39;s not too bad a run, but pestering a druid for a<br/>

	shelling the ten plat to get a port from a Druid or<br/>
	Wizzy to WC. Much faster. :)<br/>
