<div id="ygrps-yiv-395650269">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Peg, and I am glad to have found your e-loop.  I&#39;m one<br/>
of <br/>
those newbies.  Started about three weeks ago, role playing as <br/>
Qaidyanye, (still a 1st level High Elf-Paly) on the Brell Serilis <br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying to learn as much as possible from my basic EQ <br/>
Gold manual, a set of the Prima Players Guides a couple of sites <br/>
online and this loop.  I absolutely love to read about EQ play.  I <br/>
can only get on for one extended play and a couple of shorter <br/>
sessions a week though, so don&#39;t have a lot of intense time online.<br/>
<br/>
 (1) I wanted to roleplay and not use any of what is called the <br/>
power leveling ...but I&#39;m so unknowledgeable, I think I have <br/>
accidentally...?  I found a small mail quest and was talking to a <br/>
really high level (59 or so) SK, who for whatever reason deemed to <br/>
group me and told me to get on auto-follow.  She got me from <br/>
Felwithe to the orc lift at Kelethin.  So cool when you&#39;re new.   <br/>
Anyhow, up the lift I went.  I found the Bard&#39;s Guild Hall, however, <br/>
when I went to deliver the &#39;letter&#39; --- it was no longer in my <br/>
inventory...I am certain it was given to me from an NPC character <br/>
(Tissleplay.  Its not like I have a lot in inventory yet as you know <br/>
with newbies, but the `letter&#39; was gone when I went to &#39;give&#39;<br/>
it to <br/>
the Bard.   So I wandered around the treetops for awhile.  I spoke <br/>
to a few players, but found nothing to do and was trying to figure <br/>
out how I could get back through the forest to Felwithe to do my <br/>
basic training points.  As I was walking around through the tree <br/>
platforms, from my back came an attack by an orc something or <br/>
other...after he struck me the first time I ran to a guard nearby, <br/>
but the orc thingy killed me and the guard.  So I &#39;came back&#39; at the <br/>
entrance to Greater Faydark I think.<br/>
<br/>
Very soon after I started walking, a character began talking with <br/>
me, and I talked with him for awhile.  He said he was a level six, <br/>
he was bald looking and had a green robe of some type on.  He wanted <br/>
to &#39;group&#39;, and we went along towards the town center.  He told me <br/>
about swimming and I tried that.<br/>
Then he told me let&#39;s meditate, after sitting for awhile, I went <br/>
over to try and talk with an NPC for fishing supplies, when I came <br/>
back this group leader guy Summader) was dead.  He didn&#39;t come back <br/>
very quickly, so I went along.  I found some quest that said if I <br/>
collected the bone chips of four skeletons I would be &#39;richly <br/>
rewarded.&#39;  So I went to the outside of Faydark, and Summader was <br/>
there again.  I told him of my quest and he said let&#39;s go...he had <br/>
some sorts of magic spells and used them on a couple of skeletons, <br/>
and motioned for me to pick up the loot.  Which I think I did.  Then <br/>
this Summader disappeared.  Here I am, level one, innocent little <br/>
Paly, drakelings, flying bats, skeletons...twinkling twinks or <br/>
something like that all around me...no path in sight.  I start <br/>
running; suddenly I see a path, and on the other side what looks <br/>
like a stanchion with a book on top of it.  I went over and clicked, <br/>
thinking it was some sort of clue etc....and it says &#39;loading&#39;.   <br/>
(2)  Then suddenly I am somewhere else...(I have EQ Gold edition <br/>
which includes Everquest Classic, Ruins of Kunark, Shadows of <br/>
Luclin, Scars of Velious and Planes of Power.)---so did I &#39;power up <br/>
somewhere?&quot;  Or was this just some sort of portal?  Open ground area <br/>
with mostly one story Grecian architecture type buildings...quite a <br/>
lot of different races running about. Text is scrolling by fast on <br/>
my main window, most of which is peppered with abbreviations I <br/>
cannot figure out of course :o)....I turned one corner, and then it <br/>
looks like a big party...at least 15 or 20 characters, different <br/>
races/species, all slinging magic of some sort or practicing or ?  <br/>
I, irl, was at that a little fried from this log-on and all the <br/>
activity and not having any inkling where I am, or what is going <br/>
on.  I could find hardly anyone who would speak with mea very<br/>
busy <br/>
place! Finally, a gallant, (sweet) manly-man :0), took a minute to <br/>
walk me over to some sort of vertically designed stone and I got <br/>
back to Greater Faydark and then camped.  And so that is my <br/>
(probably quite boring) saga.  <br/>
<br/>
When I went online the next time, a most helpful Cleric struck up a <br/>
conversation with me.  She was very generous with gifts and her <br/>
time.  (Unfortunately, I kept getting disconnected 1001 errors.) She <br/>
said she gave to me three items  I think leather legging, a vest<br/>
or <br/>
jacket of some sort, and something else.  She also gave me 107 <br/>
plat.  The plat showed up on my inventory screen; but I can&#39;t<br/>
find <br/>
the gifts.  She kept trying to tell me to look in my backpack as I <br/>
don&#39;t have any bags yet.  I have scoured my manual and<br/>
guidesI <br/>
click on my backpack and see the image of the backpackbut I<br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
know how to `open&#39; it or access the contents.  So I found a<br/>
bank and <br/>
put my money in, and went out happily hunting truth and injustice as <br/>
only a powerful 1st level Paly can doand I actually killed<br/>
several <br/>
rodents AND a spiderlingAND attacked a skeleton-looking<br/>
thing,<br/>
ding,I got promoted, now evil Norrath residents are cowering as I <br/>
practice my hunting prowess as a Level 2 High Elf Paly<br/>
<br/>
Now what?!  I thought I would try to get some info before going back <br/>
on.   I love this, but have absolutely no one irl who is the least <br/>
bit interested in any sort of roleplaying type game...or knows <br/>
anything about EQ.<br/>
<br/>
In one of the last EQ digests I read, Flaumigevylke said:<br/>
&quot;... But I have to say as well that there&#39;s characters from every <br/>
class I&#39;ve played with have done the same thing, they don&#39;t know how <br/>
to play and end up getting the whole group wiped out. Personally I <br/>
blame it on them being power leveled and not taking the time to <br/>
learn how to really play them or know what their full capabilities <br/>
are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It would be so helpful to all of the newbies reading this, if you <br/>
vet&#39;s would give us a general overview of the most beneficial trek <br/>
toward being a good supportive player by the time we are at higher <br/>
levels.  I know skills and training is somewhat different dependent <br/>
upon the race and class.  I would love some personal guidance on how <br/>
to become a rock solid Paly!  But, general pointers are also helpful <br/>
to beginners.  There is a HUGE amount of information. Like, I&#39;ve <br/>
read in all my guides, if you are a level below 10 or so, you should <br/>
practice or train your skills any chance you get; and also not to <br/>
venture much past where a guard is, that you shouldn&#39;t try to kill <br/>
even the smaller mobs if there are multiples, etc.   --- so how do I <br/>
move up in levels?  I have no inkling yet, how to strategize.  I <br/>
know what my main inventory window is, but when I have killed <br/>
something and loot it, a different window pops up...does everything <br/>
I loot go automatically to my main inventory window, or am I suppose <br/>
to access some other sort of window to see the items I am obtaining <br/>
towards a quest I am on? Some character said he gave me a &#39;buff&#39; and <br/>
for me to go fight something---that the buff would be good for two <br/>
hours.  But how do I confirm something like this; what window do I <br/>
go to in order to see what sort of magical help he gave me?  <br/>
<br/>
I swear never to write more than a two paragraph post again, pls <br/>
don&#39;t kick me off the list for taking up too much space and time!  <br/>
Thanks a lot, <br/>
<br/>
Sign me:<br/>
Hoping for a lot of help now, so that a few seasons from now I won&#39;t <br/>
sound so pathetic and I can later help someone else...<br/>
