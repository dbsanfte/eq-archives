<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-581441168">Nah, EQ1 has a remaining life of maybe 2 more years, but that is <br/>
stretching it a bit.  Even as SOEs major flagship game, SOE is seeing <br/>
the darkness at the end of the tunnel.  They will be spending more <br/>
money to maintain the game than they are bringing in with <br/>
subscriptions dropping more and more each month.  I think SOE &quot;may&quot; <br/>
try to revitilize EQ by releasing a completely new graphics engine <br/>
and serious upgrade for the game, but this would be optional and only <br/>
be window dressing since there is not too much they can do with the <br/>
backend servers without a complete game overhaul, which they just are <br/>
not going to do.  EQ2 was a serious disapointment to them, as the <br/>
players were already use to EQ1 and the social structure there.  It <br/>
does sadden me a bit that EQ will come to a close, but we all knew it <br/>
would happen eventually.  I doubt SOE will ever cancel EQ completely <br/>
(at least not for another 5 or so years), but I would imagine the day <br/>
when new expansion are no longer released, patches are no longer <br/>
made, and maybe one or two servers are all that are left is not too <br/>
far around the corner.... like I said, maybe 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt there will ever be another game that has the same appeal and <br/>
drive that SOE captured with EQ1... however I think we might find <br/>
that another game may come close only after SOE &quot;pulls the plug&quot; on <br/>
EQ1 and forces everyone to find another game.  We may see a game in <br/>
the future released from SOE along the same genre of EverQuest, but <br/>
with a completely different story line and perhaps even the same <br/>
stayability of EverQuest, but I rather doubt it.  I think SOE will <br/>
end up making their bread and butter with shoot-offs of the Star Wars <br/>
Universe and maybe some other games like they offer on the station <br/>
website (jeopardy, wheel of fortune, etc), while another game company <br/>
with the same spirit that SOE had long ago steps up to take the <br/>
lead.  I would say the next big game will be Vanguard : Saga of <br/>
Heros.  I think that Brad and Jeff have both learned a lot from their <br/>
experience helping shape EverQuest, and Microsoft (one of the biggest <br/>
backers of Sigil) has learned from its mistakes in the online game <br/>
field and won&#39;t make the same mistakes again.  SOE has started <br/>
loosing its grip on the market and Microsoft has a habit of stepping <br/>
in and taking over when something like that happens.  I mean look at <br/>
Nintendo, Sega, and even Sony.  They started slipping in the console <br/>
game industry and Microsoft stepped in with the X-Box and dominated <br/>
the market by throwing money at the market till they owned it.  Now <br/>
the best graphics for console games out there are on X-Box, even if <br/>
content is still split evenly but leaning more towards X-Box as time <br/>
goes on.<br/>

&gt; Oh cool!!<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though. Plus EQ2 <br/>
could be considered a parrallel universe. <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t know Luclin had exploded in EQ2. Did they say the story <br/>
behind why? What happened to the poor Vah Shir?<br/>
&gt; I imagine in 25 years the game interfaces will be much more <br/>
advanced. Maybe there will be EQ 1.5 or 1.9A or something. :-D<br/>

&gt; &gt;72 minutes real time = 1 day game time<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You can check it if you want, I haven&#39;t verified it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Soooooooo......<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;72 X 365 = 26280 minutes real time<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;26280 /  60 =  438 hours<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;438  /  24 =  18.25 days<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;18.25 days real time = 1 year on Norrath<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;or roughly two and a half weeks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Current game date as of this writing is March 11, 3200.  EQ2 is <br/>
supposed to take place 500 years in Norrath&#39;s future.  Luclin <br/>
explodes, Kunark is nowhere to be found.  So how long will it take <br/>
before EQ1 catches up with EQ2??<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;18.25 X 500 = 9125  days real time<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;9125  /  365  =  25 years!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So if you play EverQuest for 25 years, you will reach the year <br/>
3700 game time in which case you should see the moon explode and <br/>
you&#39;ll know what happened to Kunark.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Cool huh?<br/>
