<div id="ygrps-yiv-77656351">Go to maps.eq-toolbox.com and you can download ingame maps for everquest.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever been to broken skull.. I tend to get lost easily<br/>
even with maps. Kinda hard to concentrate on just where you&#39;re going when<br/>
invis wears off and you have a train of mobs on your tail.<br/>
Hey, does anyone know if you can search for charm slot only items if you get<br/>
a subscription to allakhazam? I want to see what charms are available and so<br/>
forth before I combine a charm with my adventurer&#39;s stone.<br/>
luv,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Thanks for the responses. I do plan to go soon. I don&#39;t find much info<br/>
&gt; on EQ Atlas on Broken Skull. Maps, that&#39;s about it. Is it not drawing<br/>
&gt; much interest? Do we have too many places to go? Or are they just not<br/>
&gt; keeping the site updated?<br/>
