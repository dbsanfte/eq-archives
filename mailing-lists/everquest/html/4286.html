<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok I have to step in here for a 
moment.&nbsp; First of all anyone who plays alot of games on a computer will 
notice most games come with a cd-key&nbsp; and they codes are all 
different.&nbsp; Second of all how can you lose a jewel case but not the cd that 
came in it?&nbsp; I have used many cd games and have not once lost the cd key 
for the game and I keep a record of my cd keys in case the key becomes faded to 
the point i can now longer read it.&nbsp; i.e: my diabvlo 2 cd key the key is so 
faded i no longer can read it.&nbsp; Well that just my 2 
cents.</font></div></html></div>
