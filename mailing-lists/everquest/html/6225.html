<div id="ygrps-yiv-838193465">My brother was on a raid in Plane of Fire the other day and one of their group members got behind the boss of the zone (can&#39;t remember which god it was) and one of the people got too close to the other mobs that spawned to block the way out. I think there were about 6 of them. Not sure. Matt, you were there. What happened?  I just watched the carnage on my brother&#39;s screen. I was told that people made jokes about &quot;Leeroy&quot; afterwards.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt;(Assuming they are the ones that made this) have way to much fun and <br/>

&gt;(Regarding Leeroy...)<br/>
&gt;LOL At first I was like whats with all the numbers and stuff, who cares? <br/>
&gt;And then Leeroy takes off out of the blue and just his battle cry alone <br/>
&gt;was too funny!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Speaking of which I almost did a LJ last night by pure accident. We were <br/>
&gt;over in GD and I ran up and almost into the frost giant castle which ov <br/>
&gt;course would have trained all of them knowing my luck!<br/>
