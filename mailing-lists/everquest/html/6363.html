<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-275325631">The person who created the list quit EQ and left, but he handed it over to me a couple years ago. So I can&#39;t take credit for making it. And I have a moderator who handles most of the messages for me. :-) So I can&#39;t take much credit for that.<br/>
But I am glad that people are joining and hope that they enjoy it here.<br/>
To start a topic, has anyone received the new expansion yet? I heard if you buy the box set you get a free mechanical mount.<br/>
I also saw that the hotkey bar was changed to look more like the setup in World of Warcraft.<br/>
Anyone else noticed this?<br/>
luv,<br/>
