<div id="ygrps-yiv-183146462"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have heard camp checks still.  But I&#39;ve been in Dulak a lot lately<br/>
&gt; and each ship is a camp.  Passing through the old camp areas I have<br/>
&gt; heard camp checks, but not as often as in the old days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing I&#39;ve noticed is people usually call camp checks if they plan to<br/>
camp a particular mob or they plan to do something that could effect the<br/>
mobs in the zone aside from a few.  Hollowshade is one example, there are<br/>
mobs that people farm for substances to smith, however those same mobs can<br/>
be replaced by new mobs that don&#39;t have the substances they want by just a<br/>
few kills in one area.  Usually if i was planning  on hunting a pertucular<br/>
mob that can be effected as such...i usually ask what camps anyone has to<br/>
make sure i&#39;m not going to interfer with them, but if noone replys what can<br/>
you do....noone can read their minds...they might tell me they were later,<br/>
and often i appologize saying I asked but noone said anything..they usually<br/>
understand and we try to get the mobs they were hunting back if they<br/>
despawned for another set.  But those that don&#39;t pay attention sound like<br/>
they are relying on a timer and not paying attention..thats not a true camp<br/>
IMHO.   A camp is a site where someone is watching for the enemy...not<br/>
relying on game programming to determine when that mob is there.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
people sitting around the guys spawn point in QH a good hour or 2 before his<br/>
scedualed pop...just to make sure they tell anyone who shows up they are<br/>
there.</div>
