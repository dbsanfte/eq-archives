<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Look into a prograM called Norton&#39;s Ghost.&nbsp; It 
will do exactly what you want it to do.&nbsp; I&#39;ve used it several times on my 
own systems when installing new hard drives to set as primary.&nbsp; Basically, 
what you do is install the new drive as a slave, completely wiped (you dont even 
have to partition it).&nbsp; Then you install Norton&#39;s Ghost on your main 
drive.&nbsp; Run Norton&#39;s Ghost and choose the option to do a direct ghost copy 
to the new drive.&nbsp; Everything right down to the partitions will be copied 
to the new drive.&nbsp; Then you shut down the machine, switch the drive over to 
master and reboot.&nbsp; Barring any major problems it&#39;ll boot up exactly as if 
it were the regular drive on that system.&nbsp; Then you can take the original 
drive and wipe it and use it as a secondary for extra space.&nbsp; It&#39;s a handy 
program.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Your system sounds decent enough to run EQ albeit 
with some lag in the newer zones.&nbsp; Turning off a lot of options might help 
that though.&nbsp; However, on DirecWay I wouldn&#39;t expect too much.&nbsp; 
DirecWay is bad about limiting the amount of data that can be sent at any given 
time.&nbsp; If you send mroe than you are allowed to, they pretty much stop all 
communication and give you some stupid message about exceedxing the 
bandwidth.&nbsp; Then it takes like 5 minutes to reset.&nbsp; You can look it 
up, the info is right there ont he DirecWay site.&nbsp; That&#39;s why they don&#39;t 
reccomend using DirecWay for gaming.&nbsp; But if all you want to do is browse 
the web and chat, it&#39;s fine.&nbsp; If I can find the link, I&#39;ll post it for 
you.</font></div>

  <div><br></div>I have a Cleric. But I haven&#39;t actually gotten xp in<br>over a 
  year. I can&#39;t even get dialup where I live<br>because the phone company has 
  spliced my lines so<br>badly I can&#39;t even dial out to an ISP. They refuse 
  to<br>fix it and so far I haven&#39;t found any way to get them<br>to. Too much 
  other stuff to worry about frankly. Like<br>finding a lawyer to sue a doctor 
  for malpractice, and<br>still working on repairing hurricane Rita damage.<br>I 
  currently have direcway Satellite-- which inherently<br>has latency. When I 
  first got it with the Direcway<br>4000 2-way the bandwidth was 800k down and 
  about 50k<br>up (allegedly 50k up-- clocked around 30k). Sometime<br>later 
  when the modem died due to an incident with my<br>cat and a glass of milk I 
  got the newer Direcway 6000.<br>Direcway then dropped the bandwidth to 500k 
  down<br>(without informing me). When I play world of warcraft<br>I generally 
  have between 1200 to 4000ms latency. Last<br>time I tried to get into EQ it 
  just kept timing out on<br>me.<br>As for my system, I have an AMD athlon 
  thunderbird<br>1.4Ghz processor, 1GB of DDR SDRAM, ASUS 
  A7M266-M<br>motherboard, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128Mb vid card, and<br>Philips 
  Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card.<br>I plan on upgrading to an ASUS A8V Deluxe 
  (rev 2)<br>motherboard, 2Gb Kingston PC3200 ValueRAM, and AMD<br>Athlon 3500 
  2.0GHz processor (with venice core).<br>I will be using my same video card, 
  sound card, and<br>power supply (Antec SmartPower 2.0 450W) and adding 
  an<br>additional 300Gb harddrive.<br>I&#39;m currently trying to figure out how to 
  transfer all<br>of my data from my puny primary drive and putting it<br>on the 
  300Gb drive and setting it as primary, then<br>upgrading to the new mobo setup 
  without having to use<br>a windows xp cd. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have 
  restore<br>CDs for my pc bc it didn&#39;t come with any software on<br>CDs. One of 
  those deals where HP partitioned the<br>harddrive. Since the warrenty is up on 
  it I doubt I<br>could get tech support from them.<br>I wish I could figure out 
  a way to just copy all of<br>the programs so that they would be installable. 
  I<br>should have an extra OEM of xp laying around somewhere<br>but it got lost 
  in all the chaos of the hurricane.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br>--- Wulfric

  <br>Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Does anyone solo anymore? <br><br>I prefer to 
  solo, unfortunately its not possible with<br>my connection. At level 66 I 
  still have trouble<br>killing level 30s. Mostly because of the 
  damage<br>misreporting related to the lag. Although I haven&#39;t<br>played in 
  months. My connection has gotten so bad that<br>I really can&#39;t play anymore. I 
  tried doing an LDON a<br>few months ago but the lag got so bad that I was 
  stuck<br>for 15 minutes unable to do anything. Zoning takes at<br>least 5 
  minutes. If I die it will take me 20 minutes<br>at the very least to get back 
  to my corpse. Sometimes<br>an hour if I have to zone a lot.<br>I really don&#39;t 
  think the game is designed for<br>characters of my class and level to be able 
  to solo. <br>I&#39;ve pretty much switched to World of Warcraft now<br>because it 
  doesn&#39;t do damage misreporting and death<br>doesn&#39;t take too much 
  time.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>--- Just Me &lt;eeyore_95682@...&gt;
