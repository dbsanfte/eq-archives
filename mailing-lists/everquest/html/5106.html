<div id="ygrps-yiv-206926267">Ok, when you right click and hold over your items it should give<br/>
descriptions of your items such as slots 1 type 4. That means it has one<br/>
slot for a stone and that it can only take a type 4.<br/>
Now do the same with your cludy ruby. It should say what it does, it&#39;s type,<br/>
and what slot it fits in. If you have an item with more than one slot and<br/>
want to put in more than one, there are some stones/gems that can fit in all<br/>
slots so it is recommended that you put those ones in after putting in other<br/>
gems that fit in specific slots. However, I have yet to find an item that<br/>
has more than one slot.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if Allakhazam has the info but you might want to try<br/>

You&#39;ll be able to recognize the birdbath type thingies because the water in<br/>
them looks more realistic than water elsewhere in EQ.<br/>
Let me know if you have any other questions and I&#39;ll try to help out. :-)<br/>

&gt; Is there a website where you can see what equipment you mix with what<br/>
&gt; aug stone to get certain enhancements? I have some sort of cloudy<br/>
&gt; ruby that I got from my first adventure. I hear that I take it to a<br/>
&gt; birdfeeder looking think in the camp but I have no idea which pieces<br/>
&gt; of my equipment I can augment and what the augmentation does.<br/>

&gt; &gt; When the weather is better and I have a stable &#39;net connection I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; try<br/>
&gt; &gt; another dungeon crawl. As it is I have failed 4 or 5 times because<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; running out of time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The first dungeon crawl I did we made over 100pp each. Second one I<br/>
&gt; got a<br/>
&gt; &gt; wisdom augmentation stone. Even though we didn&#39;t succeed we still<br/>
&gt; had fun.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I hope that I can get grouped with some guildies sometime though.<br/>
