<div id="ygrps-yiv-973919077">Yeah. Tradewars finally come of age. I was a big trade warrior back <br/>
in the mid-80&#39;s. I and two co-conspirators once held the game <br/>
hostage. We gained enough resources to fabricate a sufficient number <br/>
of fighters to surround the entry point zones. No one could get out <br/>
of the entry zones after dying without being overcome by our forces.<br/>
The bbs owner finally restarted the game with significant changes. <br/>
Increased the npc ship production rate enormously to keep evil <br/>
overlord types too busy to pull such a stunt.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, my system crashed and I spent the following decade actually <br/>
interacting with people. Never learned how to overcome the new <br/>
challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be back in the cyberworld, even with present problems.<br/>

&gt; i played EnB in the last beta phase for about two weeks, and i must<br/>
&gt; say, if i wouldn&#39;t have four EQ accounts, i would have added EnB. <br/>
but<br/>
&gt; another additional two accounts paying $12 or $13 for each of them<br/>
&gt; was too much for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i tried AO (Anarchy Online) and Neocron as well, but somehow i liked<br/>
&gt; EnB most of the future settings ... maybe because it is sort of an<br/>
&gt; &quot;Elite&quot; or &quot;Tradewars&quot; game with many interesting ideas. actually i<br/>
&gt; found some UO, ans many EQ and DAoC players in EnB.<br/>
