&gt; anyone could please post what the cd key is i would be very<br/>

&gt; they said that all the CD codes are the same so its not like i can<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, right....<br/>
<br/>
Each CD Key *is* different, and can only be used once.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a new account you need a new CD Key, as your original one is<br/>
still tied to your original account (and ours are all used to make our<br/>
accounts and can&#39;t be reused anyway). If you can remember your username<br/>
and password you can just reactivate your old account. It will still be<br/>
there as the don&#39;t delete inactive acounts.<br/>
