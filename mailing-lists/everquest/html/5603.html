<b>Subject:</b> Very slow after DirectX 9 patch <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-455699780">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
We have DirectX 9 with all the latest graphics card drivers. Today <br/>
Everquest auto downloaded the DX9 patch, and that has slowed EQ down <br/>
to the point where it is virtually unusable.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else seen this, and is there anything that can be done <br/>
about it?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.</div>
