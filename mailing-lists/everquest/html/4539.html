<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222476135">Thanks very much indeed for that excellent explanation!<br/>
<br/>
From what you say then, I would be better off with a 128Mb ATI Radeon <br/>
based card than a 64MB nVidia for my money?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The video card&#39;s job is to draw, redraw, and crunch the numbers that <br/>
adds texture to graphics.  EQ being a constantly changing 3D <br/>
environment needs a card with the ability to render the graphics.  In <br/>
layman&#39;s terms, the better the video card, the better graphics <br/>
performance you&#39;ll get.  So why memory on a video card?  Well the <br/>
memory is a localized storage for functions and information that the <br/>
graphics processor on the card will perform before sending the <br/>
information to the CPU via the graphics bus.  The more memory your <br/>
video card has, the more information it can store and retrieve to <br/>
complete its tasks before it gets sent to the processor.  The less <br/>
distance it has to travel, the faster it will be.  Therefore, having <br/>
memory on a video card makes sense.  It doesn&#39;t have to travel far.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t have enough memory on a video card to perform all the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>functions the game requires of it, then these functions have to be <br/>
performed SOMEWHERE.  Where then does this happen?  You guessed it!  <br/>
Virtual Memory.  Where is virtual memory stored?  You guessed it.  On <br/>
the hard drive.  The hard drive is miles away from the video card.  <br/>
Think about what the video card has to do to process that <br/>
information.  First, it has to send that information via the graphics <br/>
bus to the processor saying it needs to assign this information to <br/>
virtual memory, then the processor says, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll get to it as <br/>
soon as I can finish these other functions.&quot;  Then the processor <br/>
looks up in its memory mapping to see where information from the <br/>
video card can be stored and then sends the information to the IDE <br/>
BUS and says &quot;Put these here&quot;.  So then the IDE bus kicks in and <br/>
sends the information to the appropriate spots.  So the hard drive <br/>
kicks in and says &quot;Wait! I need to locate those spots.&quot; So the hard <br/>
drive spins and spins and spins until it&#39;s managed to store all that <br/>
information that could be handled elsewhere. Once all this is done, <br/>
the information is stored and everyone is happy, until the video card <br/>
says &quot;I need this information.&quot;  Then the hard drive gets upset and <br/>
says &quot;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy here???  CPU can&#39;t you do anything about <br/>
this?&quot;  And the CPU grumbles and says &quot;Don&#39;t look at me man, it&#39;s the <br/>
video card&#39;s problem; I just do what everyone else tells me to.&quot;   <br/>
Then the hard drive gets aggitated and says &quot;Well if the video card <br/>
would upgrade its stupid memory, it wouldn&#39;t have to utilize my <br/>
resources to do its work.  I got my own problems!&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Then the video card said &quot;God, I wish my user would upgrade my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>memory cause it&#39;s such a pain in the ass having to deal with all <br/>
these unnecessary steps!&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The repetitive act of accessing the hard drive unnecessarily for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>virtual memory is called Disk Thrashing, and over a period of time <br/>
can cause undue wear and tear that could have otherwise been <br/>
prevented.  Upgrade your video card.  Let it do the tasks so the hard <br/>
drive doesn&#39;t have to.  Your hard drive won&#39;t be accessed as often <br/>
thus giving it another few good years of life, and you&#39;ll get better <br/>
graphics performance in the game.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thanks again for all of the suggestions! Really appreciate it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I already have the VM set to max - no problem with all of the <br/>
&gt;   available disk space.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It seems most of you are pointing to the Video controller as the <br/>
&gt;   likely solution. Could well be - the existing one is only 16MB. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>But <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   why would a slow video cause such a hit on the hard disk, which <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   to be viusally where the bottleneck is - i.e. on zoning, the hard <br/>
&gt;   disk is very active until it zones are goes back to the server <br/>

 </span></blockquote>card <br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   cause EQ to go to the hard disk more to compensate?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I am not sure I could go to a 128MB graphics card - would 64Mb do?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thanks once again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Regards. </span></blockquote></div>
