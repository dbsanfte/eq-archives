<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648142606">Thanks! I&#39;m on the 5th one now. I finished the 4th one really easily. A kind<br/>
necro helped me in exchange for me giving him some pieces of velium. He<br/>
located Tanik for me, and I handed in the thurg gate potion. :-)<br/>
I have 75 crystalline threads. I need to start combining them to make fibers<br/>
and then combine with teh wurm bile. But my tailoring is only 52. So I need<br/>
to work on that first. Anyone know of a quick relatively easy way to go up<br/>
in tailoring? I&#39;m having a hard time finding supplies for it.<br/>
luv,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Congrats on the shawl progress. I just came across those a while back<br/>
&gt; in my research for mid-level wish list items. Not ready yet, but I<br/>
&gt; think the shawls makes a cool quest series. Lot of work. Good luck on<br/>
&gt; the rest of them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I really like to find the lvl 1s who just logged in and don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; where<br/>
&gt; &gt; their guild is. I will take them to their guild, introduce them to<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; guildmaster and maybe give them some patchwork armor. I have been<br/>
&gt; known to<br/>
&gt; &gt; give tours of Kelethin to new players or visitors to the area. And<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; always more than happy to give peole details to quests so they can<br/>
&gt; make xp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Speaking of quests, I just finished my 3rd shawl queast (in Thurg)<br/>
&gt; and am<br/>
&gt; &gt; starting on the 4th. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gonna go play that now. :-)<br/>
