I just know some weird girls, lol.</font></span></div>

 size="2">Do things ever happen on your server and you want to tell someone but 
  no one <br>you know will care? &nbsp;Does that make sense? &nbsp; 
  <br><br>Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m a female and feel the need to gossip. 
  &nbsp;I don&#39;t <br>know any females in RL that play the game. &nbsp;Only my 
  husband and his friends. &nbsp; <br>They don&#39;t care about the gossip of the 
  game. &nbsp; <br><br>The funniest things I see go on between males and 
  females. &nbsp;Jealously mainly. <br>&nbsp;Female A gets jealous when Female B 
  is flirting with Male A who &quot;belongs&quot; to <br>Female A. &nbsp;Male C is married 
  to Female C. &nbsp;Female C&#39;s alt is engaged to Male <br>D. &nbsp;Male C 
  doesn&#39;t like that Female C&#39;s alt is engaged to someone else. &nbsp; <br>Stuff 
  like that...I find it amusing. &nbsp;Everquest could turn into this huge 
  <br>soap opera. &nbsp;Who cares about loot, who&#39;s &quot;cheating&quot; on who? 
  &nbsp;It&#39;s just a game <br>and sometimes people really take it seriously. 
  &nbsp; <br><br>And since we have a former guide (or where you a GM) on here I 
  have a <br>question. &nbsp;When you get married and you take the surname of 
  your <br>husband...can you hypenate??? &nbsp;I don&#39;t like his last name (my RL 
  husband&#39;s <br>character that is). &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t sound &quot;catchy&quot; with my 
  first name. &nbsp; <br><br>Ok and I didn&#39;t know you could get divorced in 
  Norrath. &nbsp;I just find that <br>funny too. &nbsp;I might want to marry my 
  RL husband&#39;s character just to divorce <br>him. &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t take out the 
  trash one night...I divorce him in EQ. &nbsp;LOL. &nbsp; <br><br>Ok so anyway. 
  &nbsp; <br><br>Also, I wonder how many of Norrath marriages have one person 
  being a young 14 <br>to 16 year old male and the other either an old guy 
  pretending to be a female <br>or an older female. &nbsp; <br><br>What do you 
  think the percentage of actual female players versus actual male <br>players 
  are in the game? &nbsp; <br><br>Lena</font><font face="Arial" size="3"
