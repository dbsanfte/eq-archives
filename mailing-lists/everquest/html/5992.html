<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443904189">I just came across your group and thought this would be of interest to<br/>
your members - the EverQuest II people approached us about this<br/>
contest, and we worked everything out and here it is:<br/>
<br/>
www.FantasyReaders.com (with prizes from Sony Computer Entertainment<br/>
America Inc.) is  proud to announce a great contest to celebrate the<br/>
fantastic fantasy electronic role playing game, EverQuest II. The<br/>
contest begins 12/9/04 and runs through 1/12/05. We&#39;ll then have a<br/>
drawing on 1/13/05 and announce winners thereafter. No purchase,<br/>
registration or &quot;hidden&quot; agendas! Any information - we only need name<br/>
and email - will ONLY be used for this contest! This is simply a great<br/>
promotional campaign for our readers/writers and I wanted to offer it<br/>
up to people in my groups.<br/>
<br/>
