<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378485153">heheheh, well with the new Trade Skill UI&lt; it is<br/>
easier for people to work the skills,<br/>
<br/>
Silk is the Much Needed ingredient for any tailor.<br/>
If one needs 10 stacks, it is far easier to buy in<br/>
bazaar than to farm for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
If your looking for farming items that give  you exp<br/>
as well, dont bother, not worth it.<br/>
People farm the spiders for Cash only.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For exp there are zones geared to get you exp fast.<br/>
I also think with GoD expansion, which I don&#39;t have,<br/>
skilling has some cool stuff for crafts.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

&gt; Also does any one know why the silks are so sought<br/>
