&lt;&lt; Is it just me, or do most people agree that the financial and item rewards <br/>
 for quests are PITIFUL????  At least for the lower level quests this seems <br/>
to <br/>
 be the case.  As far as the experience points, jeez, I could get 3-4 times <br/>
 the experience just killing easy mobs in a fraction of the time it takes to <br/>
 complete just one quest!!  Considering how hard it is just to FIND a quest <br/>
 much less COMPLETE a quest, the typical reward of a few copper and maybe a <br/>
 lantern or such is REDICULOUS.<br/>

the quests rather fulfilling (most of them anyway) but then I&#39;ve been an <br/>
acknowledged questaholic for years now.  Sure, experience and coin are not <br/>
what you would like but there is IMMENSE satisfaction in solving them.  I <br/>
completed one recently where I had to find answers to the question of the <br/>
disappearance of the daughter of one of the guards in Qeynos.  When i found <br/>
those answers i was genuinely heart broken but, as always, i experience a <br/>
major feeling of accomplishment at the completion of my task.  <br/>
<br/>
Many people who quest do it simply for the knowledge that they gain.  The <br/>
pride of completing a job that, perhaps, no one else has completed yet.  <br/>
There are more things in EQ than leveling and gaining items and money.  That <br/>
sort of goes along with the recent complaints about how terrible the Magician <br/>
class is.  Sometimes, it&#39;s not about the levels, its not about the power, its <br/>
not about the monetary gains, its not about how weak or strong we are, it IS <br/>
about the roleplay.  Personally, I have found the Magician class to be one of <br/>
the most fruitful when it comes to RP.  Quests are all a part of the RP.<br/>
