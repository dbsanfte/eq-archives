<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895968654">Hi gang,<br/>
<br/>
I just started a Halfling Druid named Pistashio and I&#39;m somewhat working on the newbie armor quest. I&#39;m having trouble with part of it that requires Mossy Rat Pelts. I have obtained several Ruined and undamaged rat pelts but no plain ol&#39; mossy. All the research I have done seems to suggest the diseased rats drop these so I have been hunting them for about a week now and no pelts. Does anyone know if they do drop them, if they are rare, no-drop and such? Any info would be greatly appriciated. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
