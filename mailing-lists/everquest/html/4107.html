<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505538365">About the online chatter.  YOU HAVE TO PlAY EQ<br/>
online.....The Cards you see being sold are<br/>
PREPURCHASED game cards that you buy so you don&#39;t have<br/>
to use a credit card and setup monthly billing.<br/>
<br/>
Now for your questions<br/>
<br/>
1. I have a Ranger and they are fun but it depends on<br/>
the flavor and role you enjoy playing. For instance,<br/>
if later in the game you want to jump in the mix and<br/>
go pull that Dragon and go TOE to TOE, do not play a<br/>
Ranger.  Rangers are a Hybrid class, meaning caster<br/>
and tank but not a true tank.<br/>
<br/>
2. You do get backstab and the Rogue is the class that<br/>
can dish out more damage than anyone else in the game.<br/>
However, seeing as he /she has this ability, you can<br/>
draw the mobs on you very quickly.  Like a Ranger,<br/>
your  HP&#39;s are not as good as a warrior.<br/>
<br/>
3.  There are numerous classes in the game I would<br/>
recommend going to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">http://eq.castersrealm.com</a> to<br/>
research what each class can do and their advantages<br/>
or disadvantages.<br/>
<br/>
4. YES, YES, YES, YES , YES  (Need I say more)<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

&gt; at Sorcerors.Net <br/>
&gt; originally and have decided to post this here<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there a way to play the game w/o going online?<br/>
&gt; Probably not, I&#39;d <br/>
&gt; say. But I&#39;ve seen some gamecards being sold at EB<br/>
&gt; etc which allows <br/>
&gt; ppl to play w/o credit cards so I&#39;m tempted to<br/>
&gt; install it. But some <br/>
&gt; questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1- What are the Rangers like?<br/>
&gt; 2- Can thieves backstab? If so, do they fade out<br/>
&gt; like in the <br/>
&gt; Infinity Engine D&D games? would the enemy player<br/>
&gt; (being attacked) <br/>
&gt; be able to dodge?<br/>
&gt; 3- What are some of other classes like?<br/>
&gt; 4- Is it REALLY that addictive?<br/>
