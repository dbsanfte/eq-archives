<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127960764">I was in E Freeport with my dark elf. I really worked on my faction so that<br/>
everyone conned at least dubious to me. I went into Seafarer&#39;s roost and<br/>
made sure to con everyone. Nobody was KOS. Most were apprehensive to<br/>
indifferent. I went to buy from a merchant. As soon as I finished the<br/>
transaction something started hitting me. I turned around and couldnt&#39; see<br/>
it anywhere. I ran from the building and soon I was dead. Even looking down<br/>
at my corpse, whatever attacked me was not visible. I scrolled back up to<br/>
see what I had done to piss it off. All the thing said before attacking me<br/>
was &quot;How dare you!&quot;  It didn&#39;t say anything about me being a dark elf or<br/>
whatnot. I petitioned and the GM said that it probably attacked me thru the<br/>
wall and promised to get back to me later after she looked into it. She<br/>
never did. :-(<br/>
The worst part was, I lost my level.. and I still haven&#39;t gotten back after<br/>
a week. I lost 3 blue bubbles of xp. :-(<br/>
What do you folks think? Should I repetion?<br/>
luv,<br/>
