&gt;I think that SK&#39;s are potentially more powerful than paladins in the higher<br/>
 </span></blockquote>levels.    So you may want to take a look at level 50+ spells to see which you<br/>
like better.<br/>
<br/>
good idea, going to go look at the spells<br/>

&gt;In my opinion, for the high end game, go for Ogre Shadow Knight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for race, I would say ogre, for the simple reason that Ogres cannot be<br/>
&gt;stunned from the front, which on big mobs can make a lot of difference.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ogre SK is what I am leaning towards atm.<br/>

&gt;If you are looking for MT (as a raid function) theres only one choice -<br/>
&gt;Warrior. If you mean MT during exp groups both Pally and SK works fine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not looking for MT on a raid, I go to raids with my BL (lvl 63 & 80 some<br/>
AA so far).  Just looking for a fun change of pace for when playing my BL is<br/>
just too complicated (trust me, any BL that is being effective and not just<br/>
playing a pet cleric has their hands full at all times).<br/>
<br/>
thanks</div>
