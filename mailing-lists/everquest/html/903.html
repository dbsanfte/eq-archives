<div id="ygrps-yiv-191739956">She is a woodelf, female as you can see from the picture below. She has the <br/>
blonde hair, blue eye look. I have also put all of her items with <br/>
descriptions. She has a great reputation and an awesome name to boot. She <br/>
was created when the server first got launched. If you want to POWERLEVEL <br/>
this is the charater. Scars of Velious and Kunark activated.<br/>
