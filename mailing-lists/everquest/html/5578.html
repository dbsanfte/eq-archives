<div id="ygrps-yiv-748001447">This is on a couple of forums - figure I&#39;ll post my reply here too:<br/>
<br/>
I do have to add, that he didn&#39;t really give much detail into what <br/>
steps he took to cancel - so take his message at face value.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember if nothing else you can always just have your credit card <br/>
company stop paying Sony if they refuse to cancel your account.<br/>
<br/>

I would normally say call custmoer service to get a refund of your<br/>
payments, but 6 months would be way to long. All I can suggest to<br/>
you is to keep more on top of your statements. If you were strapped<br/>
for cash, you can&#39;t afford not to.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways - a suggestion for others to avoid this situation with their<br/>
accounts:<br/>
<br/>
You can always check the station about your account status. Any time<br/>
you make any changes in the game regarding billing I would go right<br/>
there to be sure the changes are taking place.<br/>
<br/>
You can also print out that you have successfully cancelled your<br/>
account.<br/>
<br/>
After that, the first month they continue to bill you call customer<br/>
service and tell them that you had cancelled your account, you have a<br/>
printout of confirmation, and that you were charged again. And that<br/>
you would like a refund of your money.<br/>
<br/>
Also some billing systems are a little slow, if you plan on<br/>
cancelling your account I would suggest doing it right after your<br/>
last payment - that way you have one month to play.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion if you want to cancel EQ - or any recurring charge to<br/>
your credit card:<br/>
<br/>
1. Cancel the account online as normal.<br/>
2. If there is another option online to verify - go there and verify<br/>
your account has cancelled.<br/>
3. Wait approximately 3 buisness days and then call the customer<br/>
service and ask for confirmation that your account has been<br/>
cancelled. If not tell them what you did and that it did not work and<br/>
you want your account cancelled.<br/>
4. Past that you may need to contact the better buisness beauru if<br/>
you continue to have problems.<br/>
