<div id="ygrps-yiv-465804609">Well a couple of notes on races :<br/>
<br/>
Ogres have one of the worst newbie areas of all the races, but<br/>
the troll newbie zone is only one zone away, so that is not too<br/>
much of a hindrance.<br/>
<br/>
Trolls have one of the best newbie areas of all the races, with<br/>
vast numbers of good experience, great loot monsters. Trolls<br/>
also have some of the best rewarded quests hands down.<br/>
<br/>
Barbarians have the primary failing that they have *pitiful* night<br/>
vision.<br/>
<br/>
Why a troll over a barbarian ?<br/>
- Fighting stats are somewhat better  : 5 str, 14 stamina, 1 agi,<br/>
5 dex come at the price of losing 8 int and 10 wisdom.<br/>
-Regeneration, always a great thing to have<br/>

- Much better fighting stats : 27 str and 28 stamina come at the<br/>
cost of 12 agility and 3 wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
As for the original request for long term planning, I suspect that<br/>
the troll&#39;s lack of wisdom will become increasingly painful as<br/>
you reach the higher levels. Shamans do not get any of the<br/>
defensive or offensive combat skills granted to warrior types<br/>
and are restricted by the 4*level+4 combat skill cap, so their<br/>
fighting abilities will become less and less significant as time<br/>
goes by.<br/>
<br/>
For the long run, I personally would go with barbarian, being<br/>
accepted in most of the cities is enough of an advantage<br/>

First to become a shaman you want to decide ONE thing. You want to be evil<br/>
or good? IMO if you would be evil (but I don&#39;t recomend it, unless your<br/>
used<br/>
to playing evil races) I would suggest a troll. I don&#39;t know if you would<br/>
really care but they have faster HP regeneration. I have not played a troll<br/>
but I think the ogres home city is not so great. They&#39;res not much stuff to<br/>
fight and it would take longer to level. If youre good, then be a<br/>
barbarian.<br/>
They have one of the BEST home cities I have ever been to. I was able to<br/>
get<br/>
to level 11 in two days. And they have great things for even higher levels.<br/>
