<div id="ygrps-yiv-11584827">Thanks so much Su...it just so happens that Amaiya<br/>
(now on Fennin) was lucky enough to get two hatchets<br/>
in her travels this weekend...This is great news and i<br/>
will do as you have suggested...i have been hanging<br/>
around the lifts but have now made lvl 5 (all by<br/>
myself..WOOT)and will have to move on soon i think..no<br/>
more safety of knowing the guards there...lol...Gosh i<br/>
never knew i could have so much fun alone...is alot<br/>
easier because i am not frustrating the BF who has<br/>
been playing the game for a long time and cannot<br/>
understand why i sometimes just &quot;don&#39;t get<br/>
it&quot;...pffffffff...my thanks to all of you here who<br/>
have been such a HUGE help...Anyone on Fennin???? :-)<br/>
<br/>
**hugs**<br/>

&gt; Go to the Ranger guild (one level up from the druid<br/>
&gt; guild) and find Dill<br/>
&gt; Fireshine. He asks you to bring him two orc hatchets<br/>
&gt; from the &quot;blue<br/>
&gt; meanies&quot;. The merchants sell them for 6pp a piece so<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s not worth buying<br/>
&gt; them. Just look for an orc pawn that has an axe.<br/>
&gt; Check to make sure it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; hatchet and not a rusty axe. When you have two<br/>
&gt; hatchets, give them to you<br/>
&gt; and he usually gives you two weapons in return. If<br/>
&gt; you can&#39;t use them or<br/>
&gt; think they suck, then sell them to the merchant that<br/>
&gt; you have the best<br/>
&gt; faction with.<br/>
&gt; Also, if you run around the area near the lifts and<br/>
&gt; the ruins, sometimes a<br/>
&gt; bright green patch spawns on the ground. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; evergreen leaves. They sell<br/>
&gt; for about 2 to 5pp a piece depending on who your<br/>
&gt; buyer is and how much they<br/>
&gt; want to spend.<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re high enough to go into Butcherblock then<br/>
&gt; start to follow the path<br/>
&gt; (right after you zone in from Faydark) and instead<br/>
&gt; of keeping to the path,<br/>
&gt; run straight accross to the two houses (right thru<br/>
&gt; the pit). along the way<br/>
&gt; Oak Bark sometimes spawns on the ground. That is an<br/>
&gt; item that sells for a<br/>
&gt; good price too. It&#39;s rarer.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s assuming you are a woodelf druid though.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I need to find a better Melee weapon for my young,<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; her own Druid, Amaiya (Ayonae Ro).  BF had<br/>
&gt; suggested<br/>
&gt; &gt; asking around for a Fine Steel Scimitar but I have<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; little money right now and the guy I talked to<br/>
&gt; last<br/>
&gt; &gt; night wanted 10pp for the one he had...sheeeesh, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t even have 1pp yet...lol(but hey I am having<br/>
&gt; &gt; fun)..sow, no wait, that should be so, any<br/>
&gt; suggestions<br/>
&gt; &gt; on a less expensive &quot;weapon&quot; and where i might<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  I tend to hang out close to the lifts so I<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; run like hell if I have to so if there is<br/>
&gt; somewhere<br/>
&gt; &gt; near there that would be helpful...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wishing you all safe travels..<br/>
