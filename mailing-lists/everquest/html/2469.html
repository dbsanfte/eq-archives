<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011331545">If your looking at buying a new graphics board you should *not* look at pci<br/>
boards. AGP offers a lot of speed advantages, stick with your old one and as<br/>
Laine says, the prices will drop when Geoforce4 will hit the market.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] gforce 2<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have an Nvidia tnt2 64 graphics card. PCI. I have seen the gforce 2 <br/>
for about $45. I am wondering if I can expect much improved <br/>
performance with the gforce 2. Both are pci, both 32k. I get lots of <br/>
lag in Rivervale, most of Luclin, and some of the other cities. Not <br/>
everywhere, just where lots of people gather and the backgrounds are <br/>
graphics intensive.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have the money to go for the gforce 3, and I don&#39;t even know <br/>
if the 3 comes in pci format. I need another hard disk as well as <br/>
doing a graphics upgrade, so the money needs to stay around that $45.<br/>
<br/>
I would want a very obvious improvement to even bother with the <br/>
upgrade on the graphics.<br/>
