<div>First thing I do is make&nbsp;another window and have all the group chat go to it, and make it a default chat window so you don&#39;t have to type in /g before you say anything to them, reduce the size of it and the&nbsp;main chat window and put&nbsp;them in the bottom of my screen out of the way. Next go to options display and reduce the fade to about 40% so that I can see the writing but the background is faded and I can see&nbsp;what&#39;s behind it, some of the mobs are below my direct line of&nbsp;view so I want to be able to see them when I look down a little. Let&#39;s face it for a kitty most things are below my line of vision :)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For everyone they get resist disease, regen and dex, the tanks get those plus strength agility hp and anything else that will stick on them. After that depending on what classes are&nbsp;in the group I keep up heal, cure disease, slow,&nbsp;cani, dot then the rest I wing it depending on what&#39;s needed. If you&#39;re in a good group you can usually keep the number of mobs down that you&#39;re fighting but if there&#39;s only a couple of you then slow the one you&#39;re tank is on, dot the rest and if all else fails jump in there and fight as well just keep an eye on the health bars of everyone and back off to heal if you have to.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you&#39;re the healer stay back heal them as they need it and redo regen when it drops, if you&#39;re in PC then don&#39;t worry about trying to use sow, it&#39;s only usable outside not in a cave so you&#39;re going to&nbsp;waste mana for nothing.&nbsp;Don&#39;t cani much below 45% of your hp especially if you&#39;re fighting as well,&nbsp;and keep an eye on the exit, know where it is and don&#39;t be afraid to run to the zone with the rest of your group if things go bad, and they do go bad quickly in there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you&#39;re not the healer and have a cleric in the group ask them if they want you to back them up on heals and cures, then just keep the buffs and slows going and everything should be ok</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div><tt>Folks I need some tips. I grouped for the first time ever in the <br>camp in the Northern end of Paludal Caverns. I had no idea what to <br>do so I kept everybody healed. My character is a level 23 shaman. <br><br>Then I was told that I should be giving everybody dex buffs instead. <br>So I did. I told everyone that to tell me when they needed more <br>buffing. Then, after a while, I was told about something called a <br>gropu channel and that I ought to click &quot;say&quot;.<br><br>Note that I gathered that while watching text scroll up and off my <br>screen faster than I could read it. Everytime that a mob bealched, I <br>got a line of text. Things were very lively.<br><br>I&#39;m level 24 now. I figured out that right clicking the dialog bar <br>will pull a box that will let me filter out everything but group <br>chat using group-say.<br><br>How is a shaman important to a group? What does the group need most <br>from the shaman? What is a shaman expected to know?<br><br>My character is Gunli on the Luclin server.<br><br></tt></td></tr>
