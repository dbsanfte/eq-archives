<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494614133">NK is nice. Lots of space, variety of prey. I did ok working the <br/>
undead camp near the druid rings. Ghouls drop bronze, so if you have <br/>
a magic weapon and can pull them one at a time, they can be pretty <br/>
good. <br/>
<br/>
There are some good drops from some named animals there as well. And <br/>
I found plenty of helpful people around most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting.<br/>

&gt; Or better yet just hunt in NK.....go to  the guard tower...get a <br/>
bind in the<br/>
&gt; gypsie camp. About the same level as Oasis and not nearly as <br/>
crowded.<br/>
