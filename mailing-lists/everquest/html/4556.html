<div id="ygrps-yiv-18696876">Great Question.<br/>
<br/>
I think POP did change some things, one of which is<br/>
that people don&#39;t hang at Druid rings anymore waiting<br/>
for ports.  So here I am a level 14 warrior wanting a<br/>
port so I go to WC and kill some Dervs while waiting<br/>
for a port.  Now, I just run my tail to Freeport and<br/>
take a book.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is more in line of what we are seeing, I<br/>
play on Druzzil and see the same types of scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

&gt; good fun and <br/>
&gt; fellowship are dead. Even Velious is starting to<br/>
&gt; seem empty. Are all <br/>
