<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535645637">Hello All:<br/>
I started an alt SK and wanted to know what is a good focus effect for them <br/>
if that makes sense.  They don&#39;t seem to have any Direct Damage spells that <br/>
I could see on the spell list so that is out.<br/>
Also, having a hard time finding a decent weapon for my SK.  I have one now <br/>
that does 28 damage with no stats--should I go for lower damage and more <br/>
stats or stay with high damage and no stats. lololol.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)<br/>
