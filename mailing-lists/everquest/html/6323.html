<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082930108">I posted this in another EQ group as well...<br/>
<br/>
As most know already, I havent been playing in awhile...stuff never<br/>
seems to work out like I want it too and $%^&*(...im sure most of you<br/>
feel me on that, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway..i got an email from sony about everquest the otherday and they<br/>
said I had 21 days free for me to comeback to EQ ( something like<br/>
that) and such. They also said that because of the server mergers, any<br/>
toons under 10 that havent been played in 6 months were deleted..:-(<br/>
<br/>
I had 2 toons under 10, one on each account. I had a level 9 rogue who<br/>
was my bazaar trader and a level 2 ranger ( who replaced a much higher<br/>
ranger that I didnt like). They both had some good stuff on them, esp<br/>
the ranger. Im assuming since this stuff was on them or in their<br/>
banks, that the stuff is gone. Many hours of hunting and killing and<br/>
many many several thousand plat gone and lost. Is there any way I<br/>
could get this stuff back when I return or is there a chance the stuff<br/>
is there even tho the toons arent ( its been over a year since i last<br/>
played regularly, 9 months since i last logged in)<br/>
<br/>
/em is depressed and cries like a schoolboy who got kicked in the<br/>
crotch by the mean little girl who had a crush on him.<br/>
