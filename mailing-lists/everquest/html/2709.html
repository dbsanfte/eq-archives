24 hours total play time) and the loot is pretty good,<br/>
Bronze armor pieces and plat mostly.<br/>

&gt; that I am, I had a<br/>
&gt; couple of questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First, I&#39;ve been hunting in South Karana since level<br/>
&gt; 25, hunting the Tesch<br/>
&gt; Mas Gnolls around Paw, and perhaps have become a<br/>
&gt; little spoiled, as I have<br/>
&gt; been getting great experience killing the yellows<br/>
&gt; and whites, and reaping<br/>
&gt; the rewards of the loot. Now, having reached level<br/>
&gt; 30, all of the gnolls are<br/>
&gt; now nearing the point where hunting them isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; beneficial. Could someone<br/>
&gt; suggest a similar zone/area with good experience and<br/>
&gt; average to good loot<br/>
&gt; where I could hunt fairly safely, either in a group<br/>
&gt; or solo?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Second, Could someone suggest an item for my arm,<br/>
&gt; back, of legs that gives a<br/>
&gt; decent (around +3) Wisdom modifer that I could try<br/>
&gt; to track down for myself<br/>
&gt; either through a quest or through hunting loot?<br/>
