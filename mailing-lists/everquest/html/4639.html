<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I think, in my opinion, you probably won&#39;t see a 
lot of difference between how EQ runs in ME or XP.&nbsp; The operating system 
itself doesn&#39;t really effect gameplay.&nbsp; EverQuest is more based on the 
quality of your hardware; graphics, CPU, memory, etc.&nbsp; Where the OS does 
come into play is memory management.&nbsp; XP is moderately better at handling 
memory resources than XP is.&nbsp; In ME over a period of time, without the 
system being restarted, game play tends to get sluggish and lag a lot.&nbsp; You 
might not go linkdead, but it&#39;s very hard to play until you restart yoru 
computer and the memory resources are fresh.&nbsp; Now this can also happen with 
XP, but it takes considerably longer to get to that point.&nbsp; If you&#39;re happy 
with ME and the game runs fine, don&#39;t bother with XP.&nbsp; </font></div>

PM<br>Subject: [EverQuest] unusual question<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 
an unusual quest for you al.&nbsp; I am thinking of switching my OS back to 
windows XP. I currently have win ME on my system.&nbsp; The question is will Win 
XP make Everquest run better?&nbsp; I had XP on my system but I have done some 
upgrading since then and my system crashed twice when I was using XP and it 
crashed in a bad way I could start windows at one point.&nbsp; Well let me know 
any recommendations please.&nbsp; Thank you for your help and 
time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
