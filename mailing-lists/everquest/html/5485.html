<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323080785">Hello Peg its me again, I am bored I had just moved so DSL isn&#39;t hooked up<br/>
yet so I can&#39;t play EQ.  So I figure I read about EQ then.  I come across<br/>
your newbie saga again and I thought of some more stuff/advice that you<br/>
might want to know.  Ok first off if you are in a group with a cleric always<br/>
protect the cleric by taunting the mob as often as you can, and if the<br/>
cleric runs into trouble (like has 2 mobs beating on him/her and has 1<br/>
bubble of health left) use your Lay Hands Skill on the cleric.  I can&#39;t<br/>
stress this enough- It&#39;s very important!  Yes you might die but the cleric<br/>
can always rez you.  This goes for any group that you are in that has a<br/>
cleric.  If the group runs into trouble and has lots of mobs beating them<br/>
you should taunt the mobs onto yourself and give everyone else a chance to<br/>
run espically if you are playing with casters.  I only reccomend this if you<br/>
have a cleric in the group..if not then hold the mob best you can to give<br/>
your group members some time to run..and once they are safe run for the zone<br/>
line.  Sometimes just using the Taunt button isn&#39;t enough.  So what do you<br/>
do?  Use your healing spells to heal whoever is getting the beating, Healing<br/>
spells are a great way to get aggro of any mob (ask any cleric) and onto<br/>
you.  If you are elected to be the group puller always communicate<br/>
communicate communicate - everything, how many mobs there are, how many are<br/>
following you, what they con to you.  If you are the main tank in a group<br/>
make sure everyone assists (/assist) you...likewise if you are not the main<br/>
tank then you be assisting him/her at all times by clicking their character<br/>
and typing in /assist.  You must do this with every mob he/she pulls.  When<br/>
in a group use the F1 thru F6 keys to target group members (to target group<br/>
members pet&#39;s simply press the corresponding F key twice).  When beating on<br/>
a mob use the Tab key to quicky target yourself for a few quick heals if<br/>
needed then Tab again to get right back on the mob.  If you are up against a<br/>
spell casting mob use your stun line of spells (and bash) to interuppt the<br/>
casting.  If you are about to die and you have no idea where you are at use<br/>
the /loc command so you have somewhat of an idea where your corpse is at.<br/>
If your corpse is somewhere dangerous use the /corpse command (or better yet<br/>
make a /corpse hotkey) to summon your corpse closer to you - but for it to<br/>
work you must be within a certain range.  Well I guess the last bit of<br/>
advice that I can give you..and that I can think of ...is to make sure to do<br/>
some homework on your spells before you go out and buy them.  You can look<br/>
them up at www.google.com or you buy a Everquest spellbook, it&#39;s a small<br/>
paperback book that comes with other guides for Everquest.  Well I guess<br/>
thats it - Happy Hunting!<br/>

It would be so helpful to all of the newbies reading this, if you <br/>
vet&#39;s would give us a general overview of the most beneficial trek <br/>
toward being a good supportive player by the time we are at higher <br/>
levels.  I know skills and training is somewhat different dependent <br/>
upon the race and class.  I would love some personal guidance on how <br/>
to become a rock solid Paly!  But, general pointers are also helpful <br/>
to beginners.  There is a HUGE amount of information. Like, I&#39;ve <br/>
read in all my guides, if you are a level below 10 or so, you should <br/>
practice or train your skills any chance you get; and also not to <br/>
venture much past where a guard is, that you shouldn&#39;t try to kill <br/>
even the smaller mobs if there are multiples, etc.   --- so how do I <br/>
move up in levels?  I have no inkling yet, how to strategize.  I <br/>
know what my main inventory window is, but when I have killed <br/>
something and loot it, a different window pops up...does everything <br/>
I loot go automatically to my main inventory window, or am I suppose <br/>
to access some other sort of window to see the items I am obtaining <br/>
towards a quest I am on? Some character said he gave me a &#39;buff&#39; and <br/>
for me to go fight something---that the buff would be good for two <br/>
hours.  But how do I confirm something like this; what window do I <br/>
go to in order to see what sort of magical help he gave me?  <br/>
<br/>
I swear never to write more than a two paragraph post again, pls <br/>
don&#39;t kick me off the list for taking up too much space and time!  <br/>
Thanks a lot, <br/>
<br/>
Sign me:<br/>
Hoping for a lot of help now, so that a few seasons from now I won&#39;t <br/>
sound so pathetic and I can later help someone else...<br/>
