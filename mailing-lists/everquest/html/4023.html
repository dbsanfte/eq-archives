Just keep Gate memmed at all times, and use Snare and Root on 
everything...runners cause trains. </font></div>

  quest question.....</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>Hi to all. Cahlia here, 19th season wood elf druid, who is 
  trying <br>desperately to level to 20 and claim my surname heheh! Oy I hate 
  <br>taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back!!<br><br>Anyhow, I was looking up a 
  quest yesterday and found one I am <br>interested in. Starts in Felwithe 
  talking to the high elf who stands <br>by the water and tells you he is 
  troubled by his son&#39;s disappearance, <br>please talk to someone else. I found 
  that if you go to Befallen and <br>kill a skeletal foreman, it will spawn Sir 
  (something or other starts <br>with an A). I got the directions, etc. He gives 
  you a token you take <br>back and give to the high elf and he gives you his 
  daughter&#39;s token. <br>A pretty cool amulet with 3AC, +3wis, +3int, +3 cha, 
  +3Sta, and +3 <br>agi I do believe. Anyhow....here&#39;s my question...can I make 
  it in <br>Befallen at level 20 ok? I&#39;m scared from what I read to attempt it. 
  <br>Apparently everything aggros terribly. EQAtlas says level 7-25+ mobs, 
  <br>but since they are all necros and thermagists, the damages are much 
  <br>worse than they con. I HATE dying, and I&#39;m too chicken to attempt 
  <br>without some feedback. Any suggestions or 
  stories?<br><br>Thanks!<br>Cahlia<br>Wood Elf Druid of Tunare<br>Morrel Thule
