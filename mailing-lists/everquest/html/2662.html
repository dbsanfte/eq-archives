<div id="ygrps-yiv-913988682">&quot;They say that Win2000 is much more stable. XP is also an option. Not<br/>
as stable as 2000 and not compatible with alot of software.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not had any problems with compatible softwares. Compatible mode has<br/>
solved those problems that i used to have. Then again, i don&#39;t run any 16<br/>
bit applications.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;and you have to go into regedit and edit Permissions to allow yourself to<br/>
install software<br/>
on it. It is a real biyatch sometimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wrong, use your admin account to install softwares. It&#39;s much better<br/>
security to have a regular user account wich you use on regular basis and<br/>
use the admin account when you are installing new softwares. That way it<br/>
will be alot harder for you to fark up your system.<br/>
<br/>
Another good thing to use is system save, use it when you think your system<br/>
is running well. If you later run into problems you simply load up your<br/>
saved system and are fit for fight again.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;maybe that info would be at www.tweakui.com?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s a reg hack. Altho, WinXX ain&#39;t designed to handle very much memory<br/>
but you can fix it.<br/>

Definetly ditch ME. Every techie I have talked to has told me how unstable<br/>
it is. They say that Win2000 is much more stable. XP is also an option. Not<br/>
as stable as 2000 and not compatible with alot of software. and you have to<br/>
go into regedit and edit Permissions to allow yourself to install software<br/>
on it. It is a real biyatch sometimes.<br/>

   I have  to agree there 2 GB of ram my system can handle 1.5 gb but my<br/>
OS(win ME) won&#39;t handle that so well by the way SU my Geforce 4 card is also<br/>
64 MB I couldn&#39;t afford the 128 mb card<br/>
