<div id="ygrps-yiv-77609440">Hey all¡K.Is my turn to speak again..<br/>
I have stated before that as a 57 wizard, there are STILL many <br/>
things that I have not done and do still very much want to do. In <br/>
the old world, there is so much yet to discover for me, as I was one <br/>
of these players who did it seriously when doing it, but only hunted <br/>
in the more populous zones or the zones with the higher zone <br/>
experience modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
I left the game a little after GoD expansion came out, Admittingly, <br/>
I never had it before I left game, I bought it a few months <br/>
afterwards. So I never got to experience any of the new zones in <br/>
GoD, let alone Omens and now the new DoN expansion. There is so very <br/>
much more for me to do when I return ( sadly it has taken much <br/>
longer than I had hoped, But still crossing fingers)<br/>
<br/>
Like Wulf, I don¡¦t have any of the Dark raced toons, with the <br/>
exception of my Shadowknight ( which btw was an experiment of sorts, <br/>
but alas is another story) But short of that SK, I never spent <br/>
anytime in the dark regions, except passing through Feerott en route <br/>
to Rathe Mtns.<br/>
<br/>
My wizard has 242 int unbuffed at level 57, or there abouts. His <br/>
gear isn¡¦t all that ¡§OOber¡¨ or special in anyway( ok special in the <br/>
way that no one wore the outfit on my server until I did¡K<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;trendsetter&gt;&gt;). His resists are low, around 30-40 ea, at least <br/>
its around what many would consider low. But there is one thing for <br/>
sure, he gets the job done when he needs to do so.<br/>
<br/>
He could have int maxxed and all the top gear that game could have <br/>
given at the time, but I did not want this to be so. I like my <br/>
wizard, he will see 70 someday,(prolly liong after the max cap goes <br/>
to 90) but he will see it. But as it is, I don¡¦t see the rush. I <br/>
have never seen the high end of the game, from what I hear its <br/>
great, and some say its another day at work. I figure I will get <br/>
there when I get there.<br/>
<br/>
I have 16 toons, to play with¡Kand to me  that is fun. I have not <br/>
been, nor will  I be one of those players that will rush and get my <br/>
toon to 70 in weeks. Perhaps, it might be cool to have my shammy or <br/>
wizard to 70, but what then? I am not against it mind you, as most <br/>
if not all of my toons will see at least 60, many to 70. But, I am <br/>
as I have stated in the past, very short attention spanned and as <br/>
such, I don¡¦t spend a lot of time on one character unless I am <br/>
having fun. ( Everquest is fun, but as we all know there are times  <br/>
when it get old  and tiring and sometimes you just want to nuke <br/>
yourself just to liven it up), and I am not always having fun.<br/>
<br/>
I got my key to Old Sebilis when my wizard was 54/55 or so. I got it <br/>
with some friends of mine that I had known since I began playing EQ. <br/>
We went there a few times, and for one reason or another, we <br/>
wouldn¡¦t get far and then we would quit and do something else. I <br/>
have never been back ( tried to solo once there, got lost finding <br/>
the portal and was killed by some spectre who I had made faces <br/>
at..lol)<br/>
<br/>
My wizard is not Planar Flagged, though if I am not mistaken I have <br/>
done the ¡§Grummus¡¨ part in Plane of Disease. Tried to do the justice <br/>
trials, but I guess myself and my friends were to low in level or <br/>
just plain idiots, we took a total wipe and cried¡K<br/>
<br/>
Eventually I will do the planar stuff, but I will wait. I had a <br/>
friend who was pushing me into doing the stuff when I played, but <br/>
alas she moved onto the EQ2..so I can take my time. º<br/>
<br/>
There are many things that I do not know about the game, many just <br/>
happen to be where things are¡KI am only familiar with about half the <br/>
zones on the moon, the others..not a clue. My hunting on Kunark, is <br/>
also very limited..sans Dreadlands and the Burning Woods. I have <br/>
never hunted int Overthere, never wanted to. Tried to hunt in Cobalt <br/>
Scar, but I guess I¡¦m not liked there, some damn drake nukes me all <br/>
the time,( must take offense to the drake that follows me around¡K<br/>
lol.) But I do want to hunt there.<br/>
<br/>
I have been to Kael Drakkel twice, once on an open raid that wiped <br/>
and another time with some friends who were just screwing around. I <br/>
would like to hunt there, but no one at the time wanted to go there¡K<br/>
xp sucks or nothing drops there worth the time, they say. Yes, I <br/>
have mostly hunted in zones where the xp was good or the loot was <br/>
good, but not always. I wanted to go to Kael for the sake of doing <br/>
it, because I had never been TRULY in Kael. Not to mention the <br/>
faction would have been good for me. Besides, in my opinion there is <br/>
nice loot there in Kael, just depends on what one is looking for, as <br/>
is the true value of anything.<br/>
<br/>
Though I do imagine (when I am bored) of what it would be like to <br/>
see the Elemental Planes, to have my wizard and my BST all OObered <br/>
and kicking arse. I don¡¦t think it wrong or bad of anyone to go to <br/>
70 with a toon and have 200+ aa¡¦s. I will get  there someday, <br/>
somehow, hopefully long before Sony pulls the little white extension <br/>
cord from the wall, and we all hear the sound of SOE¡¦s cash cow <br/>
uttering its last ¡§MOO¡¨<br/>
<br/>
And what I will do ( when I return, whenever the He** that turns <br/>
into, I will do as I have always done, for the most part¡KPlay. Play <br/>
when I want, who I want, for as long as I want¡Kand where I want!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Kids¡K.long as usual. Sorry for the lateness of the response, I <br/>
was gone for a few days¡K¡K<br/>
<br/>
As always¡KGreg</div>
