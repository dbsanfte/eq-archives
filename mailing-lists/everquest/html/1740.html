<div id="ygrps-yiv-584889768">Hey ya all!  I just joined this group yesterday but I&#39;ve been playing <br/>
EQ quite some time.  Though, I only have one character.  I&#39;m a 47 <br/>
druid.  Seems everyone&#39;s talking about KS&#39;s huh?  those definitely <br/>
suck.  Doesn&#39;t happen to me much but when it does, it really sucks.  <br/>
I was camping Starsine one day when I was like level 30 or something <br/>
to get that ToV and then this cleric starts nuking starsine while I <br/>
was away from my computer and it was suppose to be mine cuz I&#39;ve been <br/>
waiting in line forever.  I did get it eventually though.  It&#39;s too <br/>
bad these GMs don&#39;t do anything about KS&#39;s usually.</div>
