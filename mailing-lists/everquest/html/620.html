<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033697961">I do not suggest they should put level caps on everything, certainly not items made with player skills, or things you can buy in stores.. But more like things like rubicite, mithril eq etc.. And they HAVE put level caps on some eq in a way now.. Since you can&#39;t even go into fear plane below level 46 anymore, all that eq is capped at level 46.. AND nodrop.. I just dont want everything to be nodrop so it hinders the trade economy, I want to be able to trade away my old weapon for a new one and a shitload of platina, when I can, instead of just putting the old weapon in the bank to rot away, or destroying it..<br/>

&gt; &gt;With a vote count of 19 here are the results of the survey concerning &gt;no <br/>
&gt; &gt;drop items.. The survey will close on Sunday the 15th so if you &gt;havent <br/>
&gt; &gt;voted hurry up and do it...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hmm, level caps on items, that&#39;s better.. 11 57.89 %<br/>
&gt; &gt;NO DROP is the way to go! 3 15.79 %<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t want either, twinking is fun! 1 5.26 %<br/>
&gt; &gt;Why not both at once? 4 21.05 %<br/>

&gt; NO Drops for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m no twink (lord knows I&#39;ve tried to become one, but other twinks seem to <br/>
&gt; want an arm and a leg for anything worth having; so I&#39;ve stayed on the <br/>
&gt; straight and narrow). I&#39;d hate like hell to see a level cap put on certain <br/>
&gt; items, and here&#39;s why. I saved every single copper I could, and worked my <br/>
&gt; smithing skills up just high enough to be able to make a few banded items <br/>
&gt; with a decent success rate. After saving for weeks, lagging behind in <br/>
&gt; levels, spending countless hours at the forge, and seeing a lot of good <br/>
&gt; friends lose interest in EQ, I managed to save up enough to get a steel <br/>
&gt; chestplate. If they impose a level cap on items, then I just may well lose <br/>
&gt; the ability to wear what took about 2.5 to 3 weeks to save for, and that was <br/>
&gt; after the month of saving enough cash to work up my smithing skill in the <br/>
&gt; first place. I don&#39;t think that it would be fair to lose the ability to <br/>
&gt; wear/wield it after all that. However, on the same note, I don&#39;t think that <br/>
&gt; 1st level characters should be wearing mithril and steel either. So where is <br/>
&gt; the line drawn, where it&#39;s fair for those of us who don&#39;t/didn&#39;t twink, but <br/>
&gt; manage through legitimate means to get something of great worth and those <br/>
&gt; who twink? It&#39;s a fine line. And by the way - I&#39;m 14th level.<br/>
