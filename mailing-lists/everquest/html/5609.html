<div id="ygrps-yiv-199703711">I haven&#39;t played in months. Just got back in a couple days ago. My<br/>
Halfling Druid lvl 42 returned to Rivervale, and I got this whispered<br/>
message to meet a NPC. I had seen the message before, but since I had<br/>
nothing else going on, I responded. As a result I went searching for a<br/>
camp of adventurers. I talked to whom I had been directed to, and was<br/>
encouraged to go on missions for them. However, I haven&#39;t found anyone<br/>
in the camp in Butcherblock nor the camp in East Commonlands who will<br/>
give me a mission. Anyone know about this Adventure business, or some<br/>
place I can look?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it was sure interesting spending the night in East Commonlands. It<br/>
used to be lowbee heaven, but I found myself actually fighting for my<br/>
life and wondering if I might actually have to run. It was rather fun.<br/>
A positive change.<br/>
