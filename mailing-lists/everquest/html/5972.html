 </span></blockquote>Whether you want to believe it or not, it was rushed.   WoW beta was <br/>
twice as long as the EQ2 beta and EQ came out 2 weeks earlier.<br/>

&gt; several months BEFORE it went live, AND considering the release date was <br/>
&gt; even pushed back so tha tit came out later than it was supposed to, I <br/>
&gt; seriously have a hard time believing it ws a rush job.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They didn&#39;t even put in class spells until a week before release.  How <br/>
on earth do you balance and test the classes with only a week of <br/>
testing, after the game has already gone Gold?  They basically reworked <br/>
the entire class system a week before the game went live without any <br/>
player testing.  That doesn&#39;t sound rushed to you?<br/>
<br/>
Instancing zones was rushed because they suddenly realized that they <br/>
couldn&#39;t handle player traffic in their zones.<br/>
<br/>
The quest system was added later in development, almost as an <br/>
afterthought because, I guess, WoW had one that people were fawning over <br/>
so SoE needed one.<br/>
<br/>
They still haven&#39;t figured out how to make nice graphics that don&#39;t need <br/>
a supercomputer to run.  Guild Wars has great graphics (just as good, if <br/>
not better than EQ2), and well made player models that don&#39;t take high <br/>
end video cards to run well.  And GW is still in Beta.<br/>
<br/>
They continue to run with the model that slow leveling equals a challenge.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And apparently you don&#39;t know anything about business.  It would seem to <br/>
&gt; me that to be competitive in the market place you have to take into <br/>
&gt; account things like the release of other games and holidays and so on.  <br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s face it, Sony Online Entertainment is a profiteering company.  <br/>
&gt; they want to make money just like the rest of us.  If they have to cut a <br/>
&gt; few edges to get the product out in manner to be more competitive with <br/>
&gt; other companies, then that&#39;s what they have to do.  Since the game is an <br/>
&gt; ongoing development, they can always add the stuff after the fact. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, they did it because they were worried that no one would buy their <br/>
product after playing WoW.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As far as I&#39;m concerned they did a damn good job with EQ2 and I think <br/>
&gt; they will continue to do a damn good job with it.  EQ2 had far more <br/>
&gt; content to it than Lineage II did when L2 was released. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lineage 2 was a piece of garbage.  If that is your benchmark, then there <br/>
isn&#39;t a MMORPG around that doesn&#39;t get high marks.  Hell, the Knight <br/>
Online beta was better than Lineage 2 retail and KO was pretty crappy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Besides, SOE is only adding the stuff that people are asking for anyway, <br/>
&gt; so if we don&#39;t like it, we can&#39;t complain cause we&#39;re the ones who asked <br/>
&gt; for it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you want some of this stuff, but there are a lot more people out <br/>
there playing games that don&#39;t want pulls handed to them or knowing that <br/>
a mob is underconned or overconned.  Or don&#39;t want flagging for <br/>
mid-level content.  Or don&#39;t want to have to buy a $300 video card to <br/>
have decent graphics.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you really don&#39;t enjoy the game, then why are you here?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because I&#39;m interested in hearing people&#39;s opinions about games.  I&#39;m <br/>
sorry if you can&#39;t accept the fact that some/many people don&#39;t have <br/>
ultra glowing reviews of EQ2.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This list is <br/>
&gt; supposed to be for people that like EverQuest and want to see it grow, <br/>
&gt; not for people who are going to argue every single little nitpicky thing <br/>
&gt; wrong with the game or SOE. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you think the problems that people have with the game are &quot;nitpicky&quot;, <br/>
you are mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
EQ was a great game, until probably Luclin (which was, I believe, the <br/>
first &quot;SoE expansion&quot;).   The &quot;moon&quot; was always buggy and most of the <br/>
features never really worked well.  Was the Hollowshade Moor &quot;war&quot; ever <br/>
fixed to work correctly?  The high end Luclin game was poorly <br/>
implemented into a massive timesink.    From there it just went downhill <br/>
(LDON was good for casual players for a time, but it was far too little <br/>
and too late to save most server populations and guilds after PoP came <br/>
out.)  It doesn&#39;t seem to be that SoE has learned much from their <br/>
previous titles.</div>
