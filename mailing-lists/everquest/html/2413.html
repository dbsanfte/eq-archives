<div id="ygrps-yiv-477388766">Hi, I&#39;m an old EQ user, but i gave me account to a friend.  I played <br/>
DAOC for a little, but its boring and I want to get back to EQ.  The <br/>
problem is, my friend is still using the account and my cd-key.  Is <br/>
there any former players that don&#39;t need their cd-keys and they could <br/>
possible e-mail it to me? i would greatly appreciate it.  If <br/>
not....i&#39;ll have to buy the game...again.</div>
