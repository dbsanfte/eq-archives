<div><font face="Arial" size="2">No, you don&#39;t lose your equipment if you get 
killed. It stays on your corpse until you loot it, but at levels lower than 5 
(or maybe 5 and lower) your corpse, with all your equipment,&nbsp;will poof 
after half an hour of game time or 24 hours of real time if you are not logged 
on. I think that is intended to discourage&nbsp;low level characters&nbsp;from 
wandering too far from home.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If you got killed a second time going after your 
first corpse and you had nothing on the second corpse, that corpse might poof 
within a few minutes (not sure), but your first corpse with your gear on it 
would stick around for the allotted half hour.</font></div>

    Everquest question, please help</div>
    <div><br></div><tt>&gt;Hi all,<br>&gt;Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie 
    had a 4th level Druid in the city of<br>Elves and while out at the Orc 
    &gt;Camp, with others, I got killed by an Orc<br>Centurian and when I 
    returned to get my corpse, nothing was &gt;there.&nbsp; It was<br>not more 
    than 4 minutes when I returned.<br>&gt;<br>No problem. All of us were 
    newbies once.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal 
    or Loot my corpse? The book<br>says no but I beg to differ.<br>&gt;Is it 
    possible that I had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I went back<br>with 
    a dead body I died again?&nbsp; &gt;Which meant I found the wrong 
    corpse?<br>&gt;<br>You must have found the second corpse. It can be tough 
    sometimes getting the<br>right corpse if you die more than once. And 
    sometimes if you don&#39;t have any<br>items other than foraged food, you lose 
    the foraged stuff anyways and just<br>get back the food you started with. Up 
    to level 5 I think you get your<br>food/drink and tome of discord back. I 
    think your starting weapon too.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;And to add one last question, 
    &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have no food,<br>no money, no nothing?&quot;&nbsp; 
    Do I &gt;beg or do I start another char?<br>&gt;This game is totally fun but 
    with the fact of trying to learn which way to<br>go all the time and dying, 
    it is starting &gt;to get to me,<br>&gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and 
    I turned to this board since the Chat<br>from the game options was 
    &gt;USELESS.<br>&gt;<br>Well, if it bugs you that much, you can start over 
    again. But even if you<br>lose everything, at that low level you can just 
    keep the character and just<br>build your items and such back up again. I 
    recommend that you not carry<br>anything you really don&#39;t want to lose until 
    you get level 6. Keep<br>everything else in the bank. Especially your money. 
    Oh, and practice<br>foraging alot. It will help you later on in the game. 
    Trust me. Begging is<br>not a good idea. Begging tend to piss people off. 
    And you might want to<br>avoid orc camps at that level. at least stay close 
    to the lift with a good<br>group and have someone to pull wandering orc 
    cents. I think even some orc<br>pawns might give you xp at that 
    level.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Please help and Thanks in 
    advance<br>&gt;Rob<br>&gt;<br>You&#39;re 
    welcome.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage
