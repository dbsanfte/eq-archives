my corpse?<br><br>Corpses are sometimes &quot;invisible&quot; after a death. A player may 
ask a bard or necromancer to verify that indeed their corpse is invisible, (the 
bard or necromancer can see it, but the player cannot), as sometimes where a 
player &quot;thinks&quot; they died, is not where they actually are. This is especially 
common in larger zones like Greater Faydark. Once a player has verified their 
corpse is indeed invisible to them, usually a quick log out and log in corrects 
the problem, if it does not, give the Guides a /petition and they will come to 
assist.</font></span></div>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">How long will my corpse last?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 1 - 5: 30 minutes real time. Corpses need to be 
retrieved immediately or they will decay.<br>Level 6+: 24 hours of online time, 
or 1 week of offline time, whichever comes first.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">*Note: Empty corpses that are level 30 or above 
characters will remain in game for 3 hours. It is best advised to get your 
corpse right away. If that is not possible, remember that one-hour in game is 
the same as seven hours out of game. Also, be advised that your corpse decay is 
still advancing if you leave your computer at the character select screen or 
play on another character on that same account<span
