<b>Subject:</b> INT vs memorizable spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234677811">About that ancient discussion with someone suggesting that INT should<br/>
determine how many spells you could memorize.. (Sorry haven&#39;t read my<br/>
email in a while hehe;)<br/>
Anyways, I think it would be fair, almost, only for wizard classes and not<br/>
for the clerical classes which rely on WIS for mana and thus will spend<br/>
most of their bonus points on wisdom instead of INT.. Then again you could<br/>
have it being based on INT for wizard types and WIS for cleric types..<br/>
Only.. Poor damn rangers that are a mix of both.. hehe<br/>
