<div id="ygrps-yiv-160846289">Did anyone else happen to catch this? I was in GFay<br/>
with my halfling druid memming spells when suddenly<br/>
there was a zone wide message of &quot;You hear faeries<br/>
giggling&quot;, then a handful of faeries started to talk<br/>
about wanting to play hide and go seek. After doing a<br/>
quick &quot;/who&quot; on one and getting &quot;there are no players<br/>
in this zone under this name&quot; I lept up and started<br/>
running madly around Kelethin trying to find them. A<br/>
few other players caught on rather quickly and started<br/>
a zone wide game of hide and seek. :) I found a couple<br/>
of them on the ground after a while and since I was<br/>
playing a halfling didn&#39;t mind getting into the whole<br/>
thing. (&quot;hee hee! I&#39;ve found you, now it&#39;s off to find<br/>
the others!&quot; ;) Eventually things culminated just<br/>
outside of Felwithe where about 25 or so players<br/>
gathered around the faeries. Unfortunately a couple of<br/>
blithering morons decided it was a good idea to attack<br/>
and managed to deal on average 2-3 points of dmg (one<br/>
per swing, zero per spell) and get laughed at. The<br/>
faeries handed out gifts to a couple of people, one<br/>
got a Mithiril Breastplate, don&#39;t know about anything<br/>
else. (I didn&#39;t get anything) Then the faeries blinded<br/>
us all a few times, gave everyone levitate, and left<br/>
citing the &quot;meanies who tried to hurt us&quot; as their<br/>
reason. It was pretty cool for my first GM event, and<br/>
if nothing else, levitate is a ton of fun, all the<br/>
newbies were having a blast with it. :) (I still think<br/>
the most frightening thing an Orc will ever see is a<br/>
flying halfling coming to cleave them in half ;)<br/>
