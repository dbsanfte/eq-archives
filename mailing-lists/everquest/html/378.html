Staff of Writhing<br/>
<br/>
	<br/>
The staff of writhing is one of the various skull staff&#39;s in the game(which<br/>
look similar to the staff that the Priest of Discord is equipping). This<br/>
particular staff is a 1 handed blunt weapon and can be equipped by<br/>
Necromancers, Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians and Bards. It has a damage of<br/>
9, a delay of 33 and has the effect of chaotic feedback(which does 48 points<br/>
of damage when successful).	<br/>

Its called Staff of Writhing or Writhing Staff and is 1 (one) hand blunt.<br/>
Its gotten in a really really tough place for 30 + people. Its stats are<br/>
awesome of course, however, we clerics cannot use it. Its�restricted to true<br/>
casters like wizards and enchanters. Which is too bad as most of them suck<br/>
at 1h blunt.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard that the runed totem staff and skull of jhen tra can be used <br/>
together/in conjunction with each other, yet there is no obvious way to do <br/>
this.� Is this information wrong, or am I just missing something?� Thanks in<br/>
<br/>
advance. <br/>
