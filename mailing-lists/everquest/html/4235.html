<br/>
One thing though, I would like to remind a few on this list that if we<br/>
get poked fun at, don&#39;t get mad. If you all will remember, a while back<br/>
someone from TechTV, (A segment producer I think), was looking for<br/>
people to be on the show and posted here. In turn he got flamed by<br/>
several on this list. :(<br/>

<br/>
For those interested who get TechTV on their cable system, check out<br/>
Call For Help this Friday.  Check local listings for time.  They are<br/>
doing a segment on Everquest.  It should prove to be informative and<br/>
entertaining.   I hear they&#39;re even going to interview some unsuspecting<br/>
EverQuest fanatic.  <br/>
