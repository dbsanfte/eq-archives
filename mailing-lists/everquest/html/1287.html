<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027172118">Jeff you just reminded me of the time a Truncheon of Doom dropped and the<br/>
warrior we were grouped with claimed that and I had no problem with it I<br/>
guess its a very good situational weapon and he was the only one in the<br/>
group that could use it.  That same week I saw him posting it on our server<br/>
trade board.  Hey JERK, WTF?!?  Some people really try to take advantage of<br/>
the &quot;need before greed&quot; loot policy.<br/>

All I have to say is that if you are a Cleric, your day will come. I was in<br/>
Old Sebilis yesterday for about 6 hours. I went back through my log files<br/>
and found some interesting facts. Now my group was all guild members and our<br/>
cleric was doing the commie loot. We worked the bar room first and later<br/>
moved to the chef room. After 6 hours we had a lot of loot, Singing Steel<br/>
boots, Arms. Rogue Helm, Seb. Scale Cape and neck piece and a few spells and<br/>
some other stuff I can&#39;t remember. When it was time for the group to log, we<br/>
all rolled 100 - 1000, whoever had the highest got first pick till there was<br/>
nothing left. But when I went through the files with a search of &quot; has loot<br/>
&quot; I saw that our cleric has looted 17 fire opals, plus many other gems and<br/>
jewelry. I also have a level 52 Cleric. I know it is hard at the lower<br/>
levels, but if you wait it out, your day will come. I know our guild cleric<br/>
and enchanter was using a lot of peridots in the 6 hours we were there, but<br/>
I guarantee they still came out ahead by several 100 plat ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the cleric was dropping all the runes and words on the ground and my<br/>
warrior was picking them up and I sold all the stuff he trough on the ground<br/>
and I think I made about 75 plat on those items alone. When you get up<br/>
higher in levels, you won&#39;t be worrying about plat, you&#39;ll start thinking<br/>
about items. My suggestion to you is, find a guild or a group of friends and<br/>
only group with them. If you always work in pick-up groups you are just<br/>
asking for trouble. If you think it is bad about FFA plat, bronze armour and<br/>
fine steal weapons, you wait till a good 1HS warrior only weapon drops and<br/>
the warrior says it is his to keep because it is warrior only. But this<br/>
weapon is not an upgrade from his current weapon, but he stills says it is<br/>
his, but can sell for say 5k, you got trouble. Find some friends and stick<br/>
with them or find a guild to join. <br/>
<br/>
I have seen it happen too many times, people fighting about loot. Just<br/>
remember it is a game.<br/>

	How do you know how much coin the other people loot though? Bc some<br/>
people<br/>
	can just loot stuff while you&#39;re medding and you&#39;ll never know that<br/>
they<br/>
	took all the coin off of it.<br/>

	sometimes nuke, sometimes damage shield and DOT, but rarely, if<br/>
ever, melee.<br/>
	So I run into the same problem of not being near the corpse when it<br/>

the sound<br/>
	of it, you were hunting in Highkeep, a personal favorite of mine.<br/>
Most<br/>
	groups that are not ffa usually go alphabetically and you keep<br/>
looting until<br/>
	you get a total of 2pp, a bronze or FS weapon or armor, or some<br/>
combination<br/>
	of ore (down in the warrior and raider rooms).<br/>

	&gt; I don&#39;t think any looting order is any better than others. I think<br/>

	completely depends on the people you&#39;re grouped with. Some people<br/>
can do the<br/>
	ffa loot and no one ever loots too much and it works smoothly. And<br/>
in the<br/>
	alpha loot, as long as everyone&#39;s honest, that works well too.<br/>
