The only flaw is that people get addicted and then they get irritated with<br/>
Verant. But they are still addicted.. They can hate Sony and hate Verant but<br/>
still be addicted and want to play.<br/>

&gt; Sony&#39;s plan to addict all known peoples and make zombies out of them has<br/>
&gt; claimed another soul for their army of consumers! Soon the market will<br/>
&gt; be flooded with Sony Zombies buying everything related to Sony and<br/>
&gt; Everquest. The brainwashing is working perfectly!<br/>
&gt; The fools! Do they not realize the power that Sony has over them?<br/>
&gt; Do they not realize the contributions they are making to the<br/>
&gt; capitalistic ways of the Sony Clan?<br/>
&gt; As long as this plan holds there is no telling how far it can go! Sony<br/>
&gt; will rule the world!!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (he, he, he. Sorry, don&#39;t know where that came from!) Anyway I really<br/>
&gt; need to get back to playing Everquest!<br/>

&gt; I guess I got lucky. When I brought EQ home, my boyfriend didn&#39;t seem<br/>
&gt; too interested at first since it wasn&#39;t a sport game. But then I left<br/>
&gt; him alone one night for about two hours and when I got back, he was<br/>
&gt; hooked. A month later we had to get a 2nd computer and a 2nd acct.<br/>
