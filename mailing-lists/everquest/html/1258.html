  <div><br></div><tt>&quot;We allow people to trade up, when better items 
  drop.&quot;&nbsp; How does this work?<br>We do the same thing on my server with 
  what you call &quot;king&quot; looter, but we<br>call it Commie (common) loot.&nbsp; But 
  how would you do the trade up?&nbsp; We hold<br>all items until the end 
  (except those that are Obvious equipment upgrades<br>for someone then we roll 
  right then) and lets say 5 good items dropped<br>everyone would roll one time 
  100 to 1000 or 1 to 100 whatever different<br>every time and everyone picks in 
  that order.&nbsp; The bulk of the good gems and<br>PP would go to the cleric 
  for symbols and maybe some to the enchanter if<br>he/she was using Rune a 
  lot.&nbsp; How does the trade up work?<br><br>Mu<br><br>-----Original

  [EverQuest] About loot order<br><br><br>Su,<br><br>In most groups that I hunt 
  with now, we use the king looter system, where<br>one<br>person loots 
  everything and then it is divided out when someone leaves the<br>group.&nbsp; 
  If a major item drops, we normally have it go to whomever will 
  use<br>it<br>first.&nbsp; If no one will use it as a primary item, then it is 
  rolled on by the<br>group.&nbsp; We allow people to trade up, when better 
  items drop.&nbsp; Some days we<br>might<br>only see one or two major items 
  drop.&nbsp; Then other days, we have seen<br>multiples<br>of items drop and 
  everyone in the party get something good.&nbsp; It is always<br>that<br>luck 
  element that decides the quality and quantity.&nbsp; Nowadays, I am 
  more<br>experienced oriented and fun oriented than loot oriented.&nbsp; Most 
  of the<br>places I<br>camp do not drop items that are useable by my class or 
  drop items that are<br>better than the items I might already have.&nbsp; I do 
  not like loot hogs or<br>ninja<br>looters, but I am not really concern about 
  loot as long as the system is<br>fair<br>and everyone understands and agrees 
  to it ahead of the time.&nbsp; :)<br><br>It has been ages since I been in a 
  group that use alpha loot or loot to X<br>plat<br>or whatever.&nbsp; Normally, 
  I really like the king looter system, since it<br>allows me<br>to concentrate 
  on supporting the party and getting mana back up.&nbsp; ;)<br><br>On a side 
  bar, what does FFA stand for.&nbsp; I know I should know it, but I 
  am<br>not<br>very good with abbreviations.<br><br>Tom aka Waylorn Dragonsbane, 
  Druid of 58 seasons<br><br>Su wrote:<br><br>&gt; Recently in some of the 
  groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems with<br>&gt; loot order. Often, 
  the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br>&gt; healer and am 
  expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br>&gt; totally 
  screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br>&gt; 
  loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All 
  they<br>care<br>&gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people 
  partake in<br>&gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody 
  else gets a<br>&gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order 
  some people will<br>&gt; still loot out of turn.<br>&gt; And then we have 
  times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br>&gt; When I first 
  joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br>&gt; 
  ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br>&gt; 
  picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s 
  an<br>expensive<br>&gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So 
  later he picked up a<br>&gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. 
  He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br>&gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br>&gt; Has anyone else 
  had this problem?<br>&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot 
  order?<br>&gt; Just wondering.<br>&gt; luv,<br>&gt; -Su<br>&gt; ps. alpha loot 
  with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br>&gt; people
