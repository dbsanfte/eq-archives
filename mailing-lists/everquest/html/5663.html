<b>Subject:</b> Patching Problems <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919462946">Well, since Sony cant help me.. I am looking for a kind soul that <br/>
has extra time, and willing to aid fellow adventurers.<br/>
<br/>
I have problem patching the huge files.. mainly eqgame.exe <br/>
eqfeartintro.pak nedaria.s3d etc etc<br/>
<br/>
I mean, using eq own default patch program, those files took ages.. <br/>
and if I somehow manage to get the files I needed posted on a <br/>
website.. it will help me a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I had to quit 3 years ago, when Warrens and Stoneburnt (those <br/>
optional download zones) came out and I cant download it..<br/>
<br/>
A friend used to help me by sending emails containing particular big <br/>
files (over 1mb gives me problems, as my isp somehow limit/time my <br/>
d/l if it took too long/over 1mb files) and somehow I manage to <br/>
finished patching.<br/>
<br/>
I am not on a 56k modem, but using a CDMA phone connection that <br/>
supposedly have 260k speed (but honestly the max I ever got was 80k, <br/>
twice the speed of dial up).. and if I dont use software like <br/>
download accelerator, then files will be downloaded at such a <br/>
horrible speed that 1mb will took 10 hours, but if using those 3rd <br/>
party software to somehow &quot;trick&quot; my isp insane firewall.. then I <br/>
can easily d/l 4mb-10mb per hour.<br/>
<br/>
So.. what I am asking for help is.. please, could anybody be as so <br/>
kind as to post/upload to a free website the eqfeartintros.pak which <br/>
server shows as 1377409 big and ldonequip.s3d server 1133942. I have <br/>
many more files I had not manage to d/l. But once I manage to d/l <br/>
these 2 files, 3mb big which will take me upmost of 2 hours with d/l <br/>
express (best booster soft!).. then I will update these kind folks, <br/>
thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I apologise if im hard to understand.. yep, im in my confused and <br/>
weakened state as it has taken me 3days of phonecalls, browsing net <br/>
to find solution (mess with MTU, ping, tracert, sent sony countless <br/>
patch server date, and it somehows shows sonyonline.net should share <br/>
the problems too).. so sorry and please accept my thanks if anyone <br/>
can help. Thank You (I would gladly pass a Velious keycode)</div>
