<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451082595">I play with my younger brother who lives about 500 miles away.  It was fun<br/>
starting as a Barbarian shaman and warrior team then we moved to a Wood<br/>
Elf druid and ranger team.  I&#39;m amazed even though I&#39;m 10 yrs older how<br/>
much I have learned from him about gaming.  He&#39;s hooked on WWII Online<br/>
lately, but thats okay since I need to level a bit to catchup with him<br/>
again :)<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also play with family members....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son and his wife both play EQ...   My hubby plays too, but not with me...<br/>
&gt;  LOL It&#39;s better that way... he has his friends and I have mine...    We<br/>
&gt; like it that way...  We are together, but not together...   We share the<br/>
&gt; maps and EQ info...   :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I imagine there are many, many family members playing EQ  ....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been playing EQ for about 2 months now and have been telling<br/>
&gt; my sister all about the game. She has recently got a computer and<br/>
&gt; bought EQ. So now we have started playing together. This is the first<br/>
&gt; thing we have had in common in 20 years. A little weird to be killing<br/>
&gt; orcs with your sister but cool. Respond if you like not looking for<br/>
&gt; any though.<br/>
