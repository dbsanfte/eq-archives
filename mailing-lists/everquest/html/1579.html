<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-763012082">Pardon me.. <br/>
<br/>
I did read the post..  My opinion on the matter is<br/>
unmoved.  I too have played this game prior to its<br/>
release, and have yet to see a single hacked account<br/>
outside of the exchange of passwords to in-game<br/>
friends.  I&#39;m not saying it does not occur, however,<br/>
you simply stated that it happened.  <br/>
<br/>
1. How did his/her account become hacked..? <br/>
2. When did they find out..? <br/>
3. Who reported it, leading it to become banned? <br/>
/shrugs  <br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t quote percentages cause I have none, but you<br/>
can be assured that a vast majority of them will fall<br/>
under the category of players handing their account<br/>
information over to another.  When you choose to take<br/>
that path you accept the risk of loss that follows.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a retired guide, and I enjoyed helping players<br/>
deal with situations cause by the few bugs that still<br/>
remain.  Yet Verant&#39;s policy today is the same as it<br/>
was before..  You have to treat everyone the same,<br/>
considering each petition dealing with loss of<br/>
equipment.. questioning the truthfulness of the claims<br/>
set forth.  You would be surprised how many players<br/>
are out to scam EQ, verant is merely trying to<br/>
maintain the integrity of the game.<br/>
<br/>
If you must know.. I read the posting under an AO<br/>
Forum titled &quot; Why AO will kill EQ &quot;.  If they only<br/>
took off their blinders and realized AO GMs will<br/>
follow the same procedures. =)  <br/>
<br/>
Lesson Learned:  Keep your information private. =)<br/>
