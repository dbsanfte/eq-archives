&gt; however if you go with Luclin you may find you <br/>
&gt; need to donate money to wizzies or druids to get<br/>
&gt; you to a location that has a wizzy spire that can<br/>
&gt; take you to Luclin or elsewhere...   there is <br/>
&gt; one right in Gfay though.  I&#39;d still say go with <br/>
&gt; Planes of Power becasue that takes you to every <br/>
&gt; major city which is where you&#39;d go to buy your spells.<br/>
&gt; The Luclin spires won&#39;t do that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Given your level, I would definitely go for Luclin over PoP or SoV.  While the <br/>
PoP portal system makes travel much easier, at your level, SoL offers much more <br/>
to your character than either of the other 2.  The SoL port system is slower, <br/>
but you get a number of new zones to hunt in and the Bazaar, which is very <br/>
useful to lower level chars looking for decently priced gear.<br/>
