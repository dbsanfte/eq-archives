<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771752339">Actually, I spent a lot of time in SK. Made several levels there <br/>
hunting Aviaks. Did some Gnolls, but found them over-camped. I am <br/>
high enough lvl now that SK is a bit slow. I moved on the Brute <br/>
hunting for my tailoring, then started in Velious because the time <br/>
seemed right.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] Cash and experience<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have been hunting Snow Cougars in Iceclad for a level and a <br/>
half.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The experience is good, and whether solo or duo the time invested <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; about the same. Not bad, but I am not making any money.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Previously I farmed Brutes in Warsliks Woods. Nominal experience, <br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; made lots of cash.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any ideas where I can go as a lvl 35 Druid to get a good balance <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; cash/loot and experience? Mostly I solo, as I am usually in for an<br/>
&gt; &gt; hour at a time. Get in a few hours together now and then, but for<br/>
&gt; &gt; short sessions getting a group consumes most of the time <br/>
available.<br/>
