  Everything is camped. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Your corpse will always end up halfway 
  inside a mountain, nowhere in <br>&gt; sight of the roads, or under a tree. 
  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The skeleton in front of you is there to distract you from 
  the <br>&gt; Kodiak approaching behind you. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; If your attack 
  is going really well, you are in an ambush. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; If the MOBs are 
  within range, so are you. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The tougher MOBs invariably attack 
  on two occasions: <br>&gt; <br>&gt; when they&#39;re ready. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; when 
  you&#39;re not. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; One MOB is never enough, but two can be entirely 
  too many. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The MOB is not retreating; it&#39;s just going to get 
  its friends. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The MOBs you never encounter when armed and 
  buffed always appear <br>&gt; during your corpse run. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The 
  MOB you&#39;ve been camping for hours always spawns 18 seconds after <br>&gt; you 
  leave. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Teamwork is essential; it gives the MOBs other people 
  to attack. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Don&#39;t ever be the first, don&#39;t ever be the last, 
  and don&#39;t ever <br>&gt; volunteer to do anything. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; For every 
  action, there is an equal and opposite criticism. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The 
  greatest danger to your group is a Paladin with a map and a <br>&gt; plan. 
  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; When the going gets tough, the tank goes linkdead. <br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; A group without healers or bandages is not a group for long. <br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; Your buffs will fade when you need them the most. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; 
  Whenever you have plenty of mana, you never miss. Whenever you are <br>&gt; 
  low on mana, every spell fizzles. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; When in doubt, gate. 
  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; There is not a single bathroom in all of Norrath. <br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; The Armor Class of a piece of armor is inversely proportional as to 
  <br>&gt; how good it looks on you. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The item that you want 
  the most drops the rarest. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The item that you want the most 
  is out of your price range. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The item that you want the most 
  was sold at an auction while you <br>&gt; were offline. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The 
  item that you want the most was picked up by some moron who <br>&gt; didn&#39;t 
  know the definition of &quot;No Drop&quot;. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The item you&#39;ll need 
  tomorrow is No Rent. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The item you accidentally drop will be 
  the most <br>&gt; valuable/powerful/important item you carry. <br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; If you can afford it, it&#39;s not for sale. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you 
  want two of them, it&#39;s a Lore item. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you want to sell it, 
  it&#39;s a No Drop item. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The High Quality Bear Skin drops every 
  28 days, the same schedule as <br>&gt; PMS. Coincidence? <br>&gt; <br>&gt; 
  Even greens kill. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Backstab means never having to say you&#39;re 
  sorry. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; A bow without arrows seems awfully heavy all of a 
  sudden. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Merchants are perfectly capable of kicking tail and 
  taking names. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Trains have the right of way. <br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; If it&#39;s stupid but it works, it isn&#39;t stupid. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The 
  guards are never there when you need them. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Misuse of a 
  combine button in a hurry = highly colorful language. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The 
  time it takes to upload the newest patch is directly <br>&gt; proportional to 
  your eagerness to log on. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; No two people have ever agreed on 
  a single, precise definition of a <br>&gt; twink. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Never 
  forget that your newbie weapon was crafted by the lowest <br>&gt; bidder. 
  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; A roleplayer drinks to increase his alcohol tolerance; an 
  idiot does <br>&gt; it in the Kelethin treetops. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Having a 
  tenth of a bubble of health left is Nature&#39;s way of telling <br>&gt; you to 
  slow down. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Gnome wizards are proof positive that size does 
  not matter. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The greatest mystery in Norrath is how NPCs 
  figure out what religion <br>&gt; you are just by looking at you. <br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; Every shaman on Norrath at one point in his or her life has done the 
  <br>&gt; pig joke when someone asked for a SOW. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Only twelve 
  people in all of Norrath are truly happy with their last <br>&gt; names. 
  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The last bubble takes forever to fill. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; It 
  is somehow discouraging to realize that Qeynos is &quot;SonyEQ&quot; <br>&gt; spelled 
  backwards. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; 
  <br><br><br>&quot;Sometimes, just sometimes, you dream too hard....and everything 
  shatters... there&#39;s nothing left to do but pick up the pieces and go 
  on...hoping time will be kind enough to heal your wounds.&quot; <br><br><a rel="nofollow"

  stop believing that, if nothing else, things change, and evolve into the 
  light, and all chaos will cease. Live for love and love will live for you. I 
  wish you 
  Heaven.&quot;<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do You
