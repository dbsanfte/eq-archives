&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for taking the time to read this post. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; working on a new <br/>
&gt; show for VH1 entitled &quot;My Obsession&quot; It focuses on<br/>
&gt; pop-culture and <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s effects on society, people, etc.  We are<br/>
&gt; working on a segment <br/>
&gt; that highlights people submerged in the world of<br/>
&gt; Everquest, and I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; looking for possible candidates for the show.  Our<br/>
&gt; ideal person would <br/>
&gt; be someone who plays the game<br/>
&gt; continuously/excessively and has <br/>
&gt; encountered problems be it family or friends due to<br/>
&gt; their EQ habits.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Side note: This is not meant to be an Everquest<br/>
&gt; &quot;bashing&quot;<br/>
&gt; story as so many from the past have been.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reg<br/>
