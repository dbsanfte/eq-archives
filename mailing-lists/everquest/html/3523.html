<b>Subject:</b> Tracking Brutes in Warsliks Woods <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-264891422">When I first moved to Warsliks Woods to hunt Brutes, I tried to track <br/>
them. I kept finding myself tracking over empty places. I could not <br/>
find the Brutes.<br/>
<br/>
I later was advised to look into caves for them. I do believe I was <br/>
right over them all of the time.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you track Brutes in Warsliks Woods, and can&#39;t find them above <br/>
ground, check underground. I am camping Brutes in the cave located at<br/>
3800/3800. The tunnel to Dalnir.<br/>
