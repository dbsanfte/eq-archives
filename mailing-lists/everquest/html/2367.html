<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026495716">Your own newbie zone is usually the best place to start. You learn <br/>
the most with the least risk. Also, leveling is only part of the <br/>
game. Explore trade skills, shopping from vendors, and trading with <br/>
players. Take enough time to learn all you can from your first newbie <br/>
experience. Once you have leveled your first character, you may want <br/>
to power level some of your alternate characters. Or, taking the long <br/>
road to leveling for alts may appeal to you.<br/>
<br/>
Take your time. Every level has it&#39;s own challenges and pleasures. <br/>
Have fun on your EverQuest.<br/>
