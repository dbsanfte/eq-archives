Actually I think Gfay is a trade center on not so many servers, Tunare is in<br/>
the minority here.  For some unknown reason they use commons (no bank).  <br/>

Yea, not a good idea to group for EXP in Greater Fay. This zone is used on<br/>
many severs as the common place to buy and sell via /auction channel.<br/>
Besides the lag created by 100+ people in the zone yaking it up with all the<br/>
shouts, auctions and price checks, you can miss a lot of text you need to<br/>
see. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll be a lot better off in Riverdale. One word of advice though, try to<br/>
print off a couple maps on the zones you are fighting and traveling in. This<br/>
is a good site for maps here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqmaps.com/maplist.php3">http://www.eqmaps.com/maplist.php3</a><br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqmaps.com/maplist.php3">http://www.eqmaps.com/maplist.php3</a>&gt;  Also, do not wonder out into the<br/>
Kithicor Forest. At 8 pm game time this zone turns into a zone of death,<br/>
with many undead, wolfs and dark elf casters that can range to upper 50s. <br/>
<br/>
Also, try to use the /friends feature. If someone seems to be helpful and<br/>
knowledgeable, add the to your friends list. You can do this by typing<br/>
/friend &lt;name&gt;. Many people are nice and can take the time to answer a<br/>
question you might have. With you now hunting out of Riverdale as opposed to<br/>
GFay, you&#39;ll run into a lot nicer people. I know when I head into GFay and<br/>
get bombed with tells, people looking for free junk. I automatically go into<br/>
ignore mode when I zone into GFay. I get a lot more satisfaction giving some<br/>
amour or whatever to someone I see fighting and playing the game the way it<br/>
is meant to, than giving ANYTHING to a beggar. And believe me, I give a lot<br/>
of stuff away, nothing like the feeling of helping someone out!<br/>

	I have started another char in Rivale as a halfling<br/>
	and I am finding it a LOT easier.<br/>
	Better land marks, a road that leads right back to the<br/>
	city.  Not many play in this zone though. At most I<br/>
	have seen 10 people when I have played.  In Kelethin,<br/>
	I have seen more than 70.<br/>
<br/>
	I think there are more merchants and stuff to get your<br/>
	hands on in Kelething but I hate wandering around the<br/>
	treetops always running in circles.<br/>
<br/>
	So I figure once I get the game mechanics down and<br/>
	experience behind me, I can start another char in<br/>
	Kelethin.<br/>
<br/>
	Sounds like you and I would agree on this one,<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks<br/>

	&gt; &gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or<br/>
	&gt; Loot my corpse? The<br/>
	&gt; &gt; book says no but I beg to differ. Is it possible<br/>
	&gt; that I had two corpses<br/>
	&gt; &gt; out there? Meaning, When I went back with a dead<br/>
	&gt; body I died again?<br/>
	&gt; &gt; Which meant I found the wrong corpse?<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; If you /consent &lt;Char name&gt; they can MOVE your body,<br/>
	&gt; but on a non-pvp<br/>
	&gt; server they can&#39;t remove anything from your corpse.<br/>
	&gt; on a PVP server rules<br/>
	&gt; are different, and (I think) depends on wether they<br/>
	&gt; killed you or not.<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; &gt;<br/>
	&gt; &gt; And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now?<br/>
	&gt; seeing as I have no<br/>
	&gt; &gt; food, no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I beg or do I<br/>
	&gt; start another char? This<br/>
	&gt; &gt; game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to<br/>
	&gt; learn which way to go<br/>
	&gt; &gt; all the time and dying, it is starting to get to<br/>
	&gt; me, I don&#39;t want to<br/>
	&gt; &gt; give up just yet and I turned to this board since<br/>
	&gt; the Chat from the game<br/>
	&gt; &gt; options was USELESS.<br/>
	&gt; &gt;<br/>
	&gt; This is a personal choice, can keep on going, or<br/>
	&gt; start over.  The zone<br/>
	&gt; you&#39;re in is IMHO hard to learn since so few<br/>
	&gt; landmarks, but many people<br/>
	&gt; feel is the best starting zone.<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; Corpse decay:<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; for a nude body, it&#39;ll decay (vanish) in 5 minutes.<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; for a low level char (think below 20?) body with<br/>
	&gt; items will decay in 30<br/>
	&gt; minutes of online time(i.e. if logged in to game),<br/>
	&gt; or 24 hours if not<br/>
	&gt; logged in (EQ not running on your machine)<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; for a high level char (20+) body with items will<br/>
	&gt; decay in something like<br/>
	&gt; 24 hours online, or 1 week offline.<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; note that &#39;online&#39; includes time logged in as other<br/>
	&gt; chars, and reportadly<br/>
	&gt; even if in chat server.<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; There have been rumors that after corpse decay items<br/>
	&gt; stick around slightly<br/>
	&gt; longer(and could be picked up by anyone) but I&#39;ve<br/>
	&gt; never heard of this<br/>
	&gt; actually happening, and I&#39;ve seen many a corpse<br/>
	&gt; decay, so I don&#39;t belive<br/>
	&gt; it&#39;s true.<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; <br/>
