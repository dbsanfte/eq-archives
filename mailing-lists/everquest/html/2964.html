<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Seems yahoo took a couple days off for some 
reason...&nbsp; No msgs at all on any groups all day friday and 
saturday.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I was in RM mugging giants sunday with a couple 
groups of Guildies, when we finished I heard of a gm event in East Commons that 
was supposedly connected to to the weekend of &quot;love&quot; (what nonsense).&nbsp; 
After scrounging for a port (had to go to SK&nbsp;even tho I was offering 50P 
(which went to a poor druid, better him then someone who didn&#39; need it)) for 30 
minutes and finaly arriving, I discovered that the event had JUST ENDED.&nbsp; 
ARG!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I swear, I&#39;ve been playing EQ for a little less 
than 1 year (I know that&#39;s not long compared to some, I don&#39;t care) and have 
only ever seen two events.&nbsp; Very discouraging!&nbsp;&nbsp;One was the 
Holloween weirdness, which netted me a Gown of Wavering Minds and much fun 
running around helping people slay and escape the undead dragons and such 
wandering Rathe Mtns.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The other was on the stone bridge in SK.&nbsp; 
There was a Troll Shaman with 3 or four wolf friends demanding tolls to cross 
the bridge.&nbsp; I paid him the piddling 10 G he demanded and recieved a Sow in 
return.&nbsp; I decided to hang out and see what happened for a while.&nbsp; 
Naturaly there were those who refused to pay, so&nbsp;the Troll&nbsp;then cast 
slow and other debuffs on &#39;em.&nbsp; Some of course just HAD to attack the troll 
and his doggie friends.&nbsp; Since he&#39;d done me no harm, (indeed he 
had&nbsp;sown me) I decided to help as much as I could, I buffed the wolves and 
troll as best I could, but sadly there were too many for them.&nbsp; I hope I at 
least made a difference and they lasted a little longer for my help.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I know, I&#39;m rambling a bit, point is; the episode 
on the bridge was as much or more fun then the one in RM, it seemed more 
personal and less as though I was at the mercy of any nameless faceless 
GMs.&nbsp; Even though I recieved nothing but a minor buff which faded before 
the Troll went down, I remember it with more fondness than I think I would have 
having one or another god pop into a zone and watching all the ooberdoods ganag 
up on it and try to destroy it.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There should be more like that...</font></div>
