<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920581392">1700 for a computer.? Sure a Real good one but for the<br/>
average Joe, I can&#39;t see why you cant get a nice<br/>
computer nowadays for around 700-900.<br/>
<br/>
I have an Intel Celeron 1.2 Ghz with 300+ megs of ram<br/>
and a Nvidia 64 mb video card. I get no lag most of<br/>
the time unless extreme casting in populated places.<br/>
<br/>
Machine runs smooth and fast enough for me.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree on the lag in zones though, until I bought<br/>
my newer computer, I could not stand to fight on Laggy<br/>
zones. TOo much hassle.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on the gamecube although I think I would go<br/>
PS2 since you can get your fix of EQ online<br/>
adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Later<br/>

&gt; exclusive property and resides in his room.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The computer is shared, and getting another one, and<br/>
&gt; another line (or <br/>
&gt; DSL on a network) is a bit costly for the family<br/>
&gt; right now. So, a <br/>
&gt; game platform for the TV is just the ticket for when<br/>
&gt; someone else is <br/>
&gt; playing EQ, or satisfying their email and surfing<br/>
&gt; habit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why Gamecube? Metroid Prime. Love the Metroid<br/>
&gt; franchise. Don&#39;t mind <br/>
&gt; some of the cute (Mario, StarFox) games, either.<br/>
&gt; Some are quite <br/>
&gt; playable, and often very good as far as gaming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just wonder how much more money I can scrape<br/>
&gt; together for endless <br/>
&gt; computer upgrades. Bottom line comes to at least<br/>
&gt; $1700 to get current <br/>
&gt; with the specs for EQ, and a little bit ahead as<br/>
&gt; well. I just don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; know where I can get that money right now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, a cheaper alternative is the platform system.<br/>
&gt; All things <br/>
&gt; considered, upgrades for that every few years will<br/>
&gt; still be cheaper <br/>
&gt; than the big bucks I need for the computer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But the games, while good, are not the same.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The up side is that there is much in the EQ world I<br/>
&gt; can continue to <br/>
&gt; explore and enjoy even without the upgrades. I find<br/>
&gt; the lag in Luclin <br/>
&gt; and POP to be a bit anoying, but acceptable for all<br/>
&gt; but heavy combat. <br/>
&gt; My son will do battle even with the lag, but I avoid<br/>
&gt; it. I find the <br/>
&gt; lag to be too distracting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can quest there, use the bazaar, and transport<br/>
&gt; system for my non-<br/>
&gt; druid alts. Plus, I have only just begun in Velious.<br/>
&gt; Still lots to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; May just get lucky with a lottery ticket one day.<br/>
&gt; Then a nice botique <br/>
&gt; machine would be mine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In case I don&#39;t get back on before the big day,<br/>
&gt; Merry Christmas and <br/>
&gt; Happy Holidays to all. I really appreciate the EQ<br/>
&gt; community, and this <br/>
&gt; group in particular. <br/>
