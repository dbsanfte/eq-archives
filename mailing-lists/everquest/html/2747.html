<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have run a 4MX, a 3 TI and a 4 TI on a 1.4 Ghz 
Athlon. The 4MX was able to run in full clip plane, with perfect frame rate in 
Firionia Vi at 800x600 with 4X AA. It looks reasonably good with Anti-aliasing 
although the text is a little blurry. I tried a 3 TI which looked better and got 
the same results. The 4 TI runs perfectly at 1024x768(Probably would run 
perfectly at 1600x1200, lol)&nbsp;at full clip plane and looks great even 
without AA. I just thought that the game looked better with the 4 TI, but if you 
get a 4MX you should be able to achieve excellent frame rates, but it may be 
obsolete when the next big MMORPG(Shadowbane, Starwars Galaxies)&nbsp;comes out. 
I don&#39;t think Everquest supports any features that you will miss out on if you 
get the 4MX. The 4MX is just a faster 2MX with better AA features. The bottom 
line for me is that the 4TI is a good investment that should last for quite 
sometime and should work well even on a 2-3Ghz platform. The 4MX&nbsp;may be 
obsolete on future games, but is good for playing EQ. &nbsp;</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Thanks to everyone for their responses. I take it that, 
  since the Ti <br>is not pci format, the Mx will do alright. I was concerned 
  about the <br>lack of DirectX 8.1 support. The info I have gathered so far 
  <br>indicates that the Mx is built to support DX 7. Anyone know how the 
  <br>lack of 8.1 support might affect the game? Everyone who has come in 
  <br>positive for the Mx has said the frame rates are good enough. What 
  <br>about other graphics factors?<br><br>Has anyone run both the Mx and Ti on 
  the same system? How did they <br>compare? Since I cannot run the Ti due to 
  lack of pci, what am I <br>missing? Also, how does the Mx compare to a Gforce2 
  with the 64 <br>memory load? Anyone have experience with such?<br><br>Barto
