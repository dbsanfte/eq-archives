<div id="ygrps-yiv-745461042"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; I sort of enjoy the newbie questions and silly<br/>
&gt; &gt; posts...<br/>
&gt; Me too as for the newbie questions that is the main reason the new<br/>
&gt; group was formed to keep the quwstions and strings on EQ and not on<br/>
&gt; spam, and &quot;check out this website and the pics...ect&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, in case you haven&#39;t noticed, the moderators on this group have been<br/>
working to prevent the spam.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; maybe I used words to &quot;strong&quot; for some but there are people who just<br/>
&gt; what to get and share info. on eq. Other groups allow non-EQ strings<br/>
&gt; and posts. That what we are trying to Avoid here. &quot;Just EQ, and<br/>
&gt; nothing but the EQ ma&#39;am&quot; a para-phrasa from the old TV show &quot;DRAGNET&quot;<br/>

nazi and not let people have fun.<br/>
Hmm.. Technically since this is a discussion of your list, it&#39;s not really a<br/>
discussion of EverQuest itself. So would this message not be allowed on your<br/>
list? ;-P<br/>
Don&#39;t mind me. I&#39;m just being silly.<br/>
If you are staying on this list too it would be cool if you shared any<br/>
interesting info on playing strategies with this list as well. :-)<br/>
luv,<br/>
