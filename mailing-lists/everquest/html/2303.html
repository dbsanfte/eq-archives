&gt; #1 DOn&#39;t feel rushed to get your first character up<br/>
&gt; to higher levels.  EQ is<br/>
&gt; a huge place and there is so much to do and see.  If<br/>
&gt; you take your time you<br/>
&gt; will have a much better experience, IMHO!  (I played<br/>
&gt; my Ranger for a year<br/>
&gt; and he only reached 27).<br/>

took you that long? <br/>
<br/>
Honestly man, what were you doing all that time?<br/>
