 /FOLLOW!!!! WOOOHOOO!!! Can&#39;t wait till they put this into the other<br/>

	Test Server Update 6/3/99 6:30 pm <br/>
	The following features and bug fixes have gone up onto the Test<br/>
server. <br/>
	- Charmed and Feared characters can no longer use skills. <br/>
	- The appropriate text message is given while attempting to attack<br/>
while charmed. <br/>
	- Procing weapons no longer break Bard&#39;s singing. <br/>
	- Players vision will now return to normal if killed while drunk. <br/>
	- Tree Form spells will change the caster into a human male in a<br/>
zone without trees. <br/>
	- Red and Blue armor will now appear the proper color for AMD users.<br/>
<br/>
	- While accessing the /bug screen, the in-game chat bar will no<br/>
longer remain active. <br/>
	- If the inventory window is up and the spell book is open, the user<br/>
will not remove items from their inventory when clicking on the spell book. <br/>
	- A number of quests were fixed as well as implemented. <br/>
	- A Bad language filter has been implemented. Typing &quot;/filter&quot; will<br/>
toggle it on and off. <br/>
	- Pets that have been commanded to sit will no longer to appear to<br/>
stand up while they are supposed to be seated. <br/>
	- Certain Bard spells will now require the use of Mana if noted. <br/>
	- While in the full screen view, users may now toggle the<br/>
translucent overlay backgrounds on and off by pressing the &quot;~&quot; key. <br/>
	- Players may now loot corpses in shallow water or lava by typing<br/>
&quot;/loot&quot; while the corpse is targeted. <br/>
	- We have implemented an Auto-follow command. To auto-follow another<br/>
character, target the character, then type &quot;/follow&quot;. <br/>
	- A Role Playing switched has been added so that players may<br/>
identify other characters that are Role Playing. To activate the Role<br/>
Playing switch, target your character and type &quot;/roleplay&quot;, if the character<br/>
is +PvP, the name tag above their head will appear as a darker shade of Red,<br/>
whereas a non-PvP players name will appear purple. <br/>
	Trade Skill Changes <br/>
	Jewel Craft - All of the jewelry has had increased magical<br/>
properties, however, the existing item remain unchanged. <br/>
	Fletching - When fletching arrows, they will be produced in sets of<br/>
5, instead of 1. <br/>
	Baking, Blacksmithing, Brewing, and Pottery have been changed to<br/>
either return items on failure and be able to produce multiple items and<br/>
quantities on success. <br/>
	Example: Baking muffins - success means the player will receive<br/>
three muffins and retaining the muffin tin, however, when unsuccessful, the<br/>
player will still get the muffin tin back and lose all other components.<br/>
Another example would be if a player wishes to sharpen a rusty short sword.<br/>
If the player succeeds, they will receive a tarnished short sword, however,<br/>
failure will result in retaining the rusty weapon but losing the sharpening<br/>
stone. <br/>
