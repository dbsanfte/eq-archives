<div id="ygrps-yiv-420812073"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Sets up a good rule of thumb though anyways. Usually<br/>
&gt; when you&#39;re down to 20% mana it&#39;s time to start<br/>
&gt; considering gating. Nothing worse than getting stuck<br/>
&gt; doing that &quot;snare, run, med, root, med some more, pray<br/>
&gt; root doesn&#39;t break, med up enough mana for a DOT, run,<br/>
&gt; try to get up enough mana for another root&quot; juggling<br/>
&gt; routine. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True. What I hate is when people dont&#39; realize I&#39;m kiting something and<br/>
decide to &quot;help&quot; me by killing the things chasing me. Happens all the time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Heh. You are foggy. Bind affinity comes at level 14.<br/>
&gt; &gt; As does sow. And it costs around 8pp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My druid just dinged 14 and the spells were pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; expensive.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s been quite a while. :) As for the expense of the<br/>
&gt; spells, that&#39;s part of why I recommend EC as a hunting<br/>
&gt; grounds up til around lvl 10-12, HQ Bear Pelts and<br/>
&gt; Spider Silk are the two best methods of making some<br/>
&gt; quick cash for a new player. Stacks of Bone Chips<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t bad either. All are easily available in EC and<br/>
&gt; WC, and in the latter you can kill bears/spiders up<br/>
&gt; til around lvl 15.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the bear skins are ok if you aren&#39;t roleplaying and decide it&#39;s ok for<br/>
a druid to be killing bears. I personally don&#39;t kill bears or wolves with my<br/>
druid.<br/>
However, if you can make it through Paludal Caverns and get to Shadeweaver&#39;s<br/>
Thicket in one piece, there are tons of rockhopper hides. HQ rockhopper<br/>
hides drop more frequently than bear pelts and can be used in the same way<br/>
as bear pelts to make the same backpacks. and you can make weight reduction<br/>
bags with MQ rockhopper pelts too. Damanged hopper hides are good for<br/>
tattered armor. And the shadeling silks are good too.<br/>
