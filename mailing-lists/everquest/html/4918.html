<div id="ygrps-yiv-98421549">The feature I dislike is Research.  It amounts to no more than going <br/>
to hundreds of vendors, over and over again to find a page, or words <br/>
or rune, buy it and then have it fail when you try to make the <br/>
spell.  The idea is to have you kill mobs for it.....but the mobs <br/>
are allways higher level, and rarely drop it when you want it.  By <br/>
the time you get the pages or runes you need for your 16th level <br/>
spell......you&#39;re 32nd level.  So you have to buy them, at inflated <br/>
prices, and thats IF you can find them.  Then after going thru all <br/>
that....poof...it fails, and you have to start all over again.  A <br/>
stupid idea.  Why not have the spells drop off certin mobs like a <br/>
quest, so then peeps will camp them, oh my, don&#39;t have a good <br/>
soultion, but current one is not fun.</div>
