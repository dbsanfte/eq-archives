<div id="ygrps-yiv-832030766"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I actually like it so far. the newbie area is pretty<br/>
&gt;cool. lots of things to do and quests to do. there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;an outdoor bank, merchants. all kinds of cool<br/>
&gt;stuff. and you don&#39;t have to worry about falling to<br/>
&gt;your death like in Kelethin.<br/>
&gt;I also like how berries just spawn on the ground for<br/>
&gt;you to pickup. sure you still have to buy drink but<br/>
&gt;there&#39;s plenty of free food around.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just found Luclin as a whole horribly underwhelming.<br/>
The new class is rather uninteresting, the new zones<br/>
when they actually work aren&#39;t anything special, and<br/>
the new graphics, well, they&#39;re shut off. (and the<br/>
models I turned on were all hideous, didn&#39;t like the<br/>
Dwarf or Halfling models at all, it&#39;s embarassing to<br/>
think I look like that to some people) Of course, I<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t be quite as soured on it if it<br/>
wasn&#39;t for all the bad bugs and lengthy downtime right<br/>
in the middle of my usual play time. (generally play<br/>
from 2am til 6am PST, downtime was always 3am-6am) I<br/>
certainly appreciate Kunark a lot more post-Luclin<br/>
though. :)<br/>

&gt; free or small donation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>10pp is a small donation. :) But yeah, that was<br/>
essentially what I was suggesting. I always made a<br/>
point of scrounging up the 10pp selling crushbone<br/>
belts when I wanted to go somewhere, and most druids<br/>
refused it, felt appropriate to offer though. :)<br/>
