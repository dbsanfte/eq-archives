<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EverQuest] Game loading faster <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-387849888">Dang Su, what&#39;s the stats on your PC? I think mine takes about 5 minutes to<br/>
load.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I have...<br/>
<br/>
eMachines W3050 Wal*Mart special (Hey, it was cheap and I needed something<br/>
bad)<br/>
<br/>
2Ghz AMD processor<br/>
2GB Ram (upgraded from 512)<br/>
80GB HD <br/>
10GB HD (Added)<br/>
<br/>
I have the OS (WinXP Pro, it came with Home) loaded on the 10GB drive and<br/>
the 80 GB drive partitioned off with a 5GB partition dedicated as a swap or<br/>
paging file. <br/>
<br/>
Granted this probably helps me load faster but can be a real headache to<br/>
configure for the average computer user who doesn&#39;t want to mess with all<br/>
that. Also when was the last time you defragged? That could help some.<br/>
<br/>

Since it takes me 20 minutes to load I tend to just walk away during that<br/>
part. :-)<br/>
luv,<br/>
