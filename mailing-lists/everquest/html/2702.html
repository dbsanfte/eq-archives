&gt; Oooooh!  What a conversation starter!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; G&#39;Fay is famous for the /ooc beggar.<br/>
<br/>
No argument here =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I too often seek out young players above 3rd or 4th season that appear to<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; working hard to advance themselves the way that most of us did as<br/>
&gt; NewB&#39;s....and while I expect nothing in return for the small gifts that I<br/>
&gt; give. I find that more often than not these players are very thankful and<br/>
&gt; benevolent.  It just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to make some new<br/>
&gt; player&#39;s day.<br/>
&gt; I have found that it &quot;pays&quot; to work hard for the things that you want--in<br/>
RL<br/>
&gt; and in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Agree. After all, you never know when that level 4 enchanter will become a<br/>
level 40 clarity dispenser =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was going to say something about how all beggars should publicly die<br/>
slow<br/>
&gt; cruel deaths in explicit detail, but I&#39;ll leave it to your imagination----<br/>
<br/>
My original message had something similar in it, but I deleted the remark<br/>
before I sent the message, not wanting to seem &quot;harsh&quot;<br/>
