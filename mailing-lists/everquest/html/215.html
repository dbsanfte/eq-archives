<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046887680">Observer&#39;s Staff<br/>
<br/>
This staff can be obtained as part of a level 30+ quest. The staff can be<br/>
used by priest and mage types(wizard, magician, enchanter, necromancer,<br/>
cleric, druid and shaman). This two handed staff carries a damage of 12 and<br/>
a delay of 39. It also grants +5 intelligence, +5 wisdom, and +30 mana. As<br/>
if that was not enough it has charges of the enchanter spell Sentinel which<br/>
will warn you of others drawing near you when you are meditating.<br/>
<br/>
Runed Totem<br/>
<br/>
The runed totem staff can be looted off Shaman Ren Rexx at Paw. It is a<br/>
favorite among casters. It is a 2 handed staff which has an attack value of<br/>
9, a delay of 37 and also grants +5 mana and hit points.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I dought that you will be able to hold two Totems (since they are two handed<br/>
weapons and we dont get dual weild anyways..<br/>
