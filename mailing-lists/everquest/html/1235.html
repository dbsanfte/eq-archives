<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628331205">I think it also depends on how well you &quot;know&quot; the other person you&#39;re<br/>
grouping with. sometimes after grouping with someone numerous times or for a<br/>
long period of time people (at least in my groups) just say &quot;sow wore off&quot;<br/>
or &quot;___ buff wore off&quot;-- so the person who casts the spell will just<br/>
automatically cast the spell when mana permits. The intention is not to be<br/>
rude.<br/>

I&#39;m a 17th level druid and have only experienced this a couple of times and<br/>
usually ignore them especially when they are rude about it.  My husband and<br/>
I both play at the same time and usually group together, and occasionally we<br/>
will pick up someone and group with them.  I think what I hate the most is<br/>
when the other people in the group ask for SoW&#39;s and do it quite rudely.<br/>

HOW RUDE&gt;&gt;&gt;!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Usually when people do that I tell my husband that I want to leave the group<br/>
or don&#39;t buff that guy as much as the others.  I can&#39;t stand that.  If<br/>
people want to group because I know its better and you can fight more, lets<br/>
try not being so RUDE!<br/>
