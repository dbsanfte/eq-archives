<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484801979">I logged in for a second the other night and noticed<br/>
that the characters look a little more &quot;real&quot; now, and<br/>
the stars in the sky are a nice touch. But I wasn&#39;t<br/>
able to do any real playing, just wandered around on<br/>
an alt for a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
After reading all this though, I&#39;m not sure if I want<br/>
to try and play, hehe. Maybe I&#39;ll wait a few more<br/>
weeks... or months...<br/>

&gt; why this is happening so often, but my guild leader<br/>
&gt; cant hardly play anymore since he tends to LD just<br/>
&gt; crossing a zone (has even fallen through the earth<br/>
&gt; and died one time.)  Not sure when they will finally<br/>
&gt; get it ironed out, but hope its soon.<br/>

&gt;   I&#39;ve not been playing for a while now, but this<br/>
&gt; has made me curious.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I upgraded to DX9 last summer so I could play SWG.<br/>
&gt; Then I started playing EQ again last fall, still<br/>
&gt; using DX9. I didn&#39;t notice any difference, just my<br/>
&gt; usual lag in PoK and the bazaar. So, is it the DX9<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s messing everyone up, or some &quot;upgrade&quot; that<br/>
&gt; SOE did to the graphic engine?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
