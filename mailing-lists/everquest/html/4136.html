<div id="ygrps-yiv-127887785">I have been exploring the pok for my last two sessions. Had a bit of <br/>
a break between sessions due to having no power for most of a week. <br/>
Quite a storm here in the Central Coast district of California.<br/>
<br/>
In talking with many NPC&#39;s I found them giving me about a paragraph <br/>
of monologue, breaking at a point which indicates more to come. <br/>
However, few have the &quot;continue&quot; command attached. Anyone know how to <br/>
get the whole monologue from these NPC&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
I tried increasing the size of my dialogue box, but had no success. <br/>
Now I did have two boxes open, side by side, and only tried adding <br/>
length to the box in which the NPC&#39;s were talking. I may try a wider, <br/>
longer box next time. Anyone have any experience in pok with this <br/>
problem?<br/>
