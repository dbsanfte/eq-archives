your old account of course, but you could make a new toon and check things<br/>
out until you have the $$ to get signed back up.<br/>

As for what has gone on since April, I am not sure.  I got back in myself a<br/>
little while ago.  You can make all traders in Bazaar invisible to help with<br/>
lag, not sure when that came out.  The link above will take you to the<br/>
official site and there you can read the latest updates.<br/>
