<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] New games <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363471436">It all depends on the features and just how affordable it is.<br/>
What kind of features are you looking at and are you up for some<br/>
suggestions?<br/>
If you want to get into alot of specifics you can email me off-list.<br/>
I was actually thinking of starting a thread on what people would want to<br/>
see in a game if they could modify or create their own game. Anyone up for<br/>
that?<br/>

&gt; spend your money and you time playing another game that is alot like<br/>
&gt; everquest.<br/>
