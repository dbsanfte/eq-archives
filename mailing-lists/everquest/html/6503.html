making Distillate of Alacrity I. I have a long way to go before it will be <br/>
worth the expense in failures to do a Clarity X. I&#39;m just a level 44 kitty.<br/>
<br/>
Do you bring the points up faster if you mix the more advanced stuff? I&#39;m <br/>
just asking because I really don&#39;t know.<br/>

I got two shawls doing Great Divide quests. The giants in the Great Divide <br/>
don&#39;t like me anymore. G.<br/>
