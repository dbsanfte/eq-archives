<div id="ygrps-yiv-780537353">Hey, does anyone know what&#39;s up with the Everquest-based comic <br/>
GuComics.com? For a week or so now their page has been down and now <br/>
it looks like the name isn&#39;t registered anymore. That was my favorite <br/>
online comic next to Penny Arcade and I really want to know what <br/>
happened! Anyone?</div>
