<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Female Slaves <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211988144"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; thanks, i already looked up the quest, but all high female slaves are in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>blue dress, cos they wear the noob clothes, but havnt even seen any male<br/>
high elf either.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; damn things wont spawn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ohh. Ok. I thought you meant like wearing a dark blue robe or something.<br/>
wrong mental image. Ok. So you wanted a pretty much &quot;naked&quot; regular one.<br/>
Yeah, sometimes they are hard to spawn. Either find a way to get the orcs to<br/>
kill a slave OR give keys to get them to leave and one will eventually<br/>
spawn.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; can anyone recommend a better robe for a level 14 mage, havnt got any<br/>
 </span></blockquote>money so buying of another player isnt really an option (besides i think<br/>
buying stuff off other players defies the point of the game)<br/>

Look up info on all of the ones in your lvl range. Might help. :-)<br/>
Also try a search for gown or something like that.<br/>
