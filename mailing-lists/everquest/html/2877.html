  <div><br></div><tt>&gt; Go to Frontier Mountains, in Kunark, and get into a 
  Giant Fort group.<br>Great<br>&gt; exp, nice loot. Druids are always in demand 
  -- &quot;sow please.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>Heh. You&#39;ll be lucky if you get a &quot;please&quot;. I&#39;ve 
  found people just say &quot;can<br>I have sow&quot;. (now that my druid is able to sow). 
  I had one guy come up and<br>bug me when I was turning in CB belts in Kaladim 
  yesterday. He said &quot;can I<br>have sow.&quot; I said &quot;I can&#39;t cast that spell 
  indoors&quot;. guy says &quot;What are you<br>giving him?&quot; me: &quot;Crushbone belts&quot; guy 
  &quot;Can I have sow.&quot;<br>So I tried to cast it on him just to show it wouldn&#39;t 
  work. then I told him<br>the message. I was just about to camp. He&#39;s like &quot;ok. 
  tell me when you&#39;re<br>leaving so you can sow me.&quot;<br>I was thinking &quot;would it 
  kill the person to ask if I could go out and sow<br>him? or to say please?&quot; 
  That has been bothering me lately. Lack of manners.<br>I&#39;ve been casting sow 
  on people before they can ask for it lately. they hail<br>me and I cast it. 
  Just so I won&#39;t have to be angry if they don&#39;t say please.<br>Most of them say 
  thanks at least.<br>anyhoo, I just camped right there and never said another 
  word to the person.<br>I was too tired to deal with 
  it.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
