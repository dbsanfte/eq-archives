<div id="ygrps-yiv-620204043">Well Su got most of it that I know of except the part about the guild <br/>
messaging. I need to check that out. Maybe it will help in recruitment <br/>
for Mystic Crusaders!<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest trying a site like Allakhazam <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/)">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/)</a> and the main EQ site.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;Can anyone give me a list or such of the thinngs that have changed <br/>
&gt;&gt;since May of last year..I know of a couple expansions..but not sure <br/>

&gt;&gt;again &quot;fulltime&quot; and not feel like a newb again (is a nasty feeling)<br/>
