<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901893287">The $1700 figure is based on getting a system with at least two years <br/>
before upgrades become a serious consideration (to maintain optimal <br/>
opperation) and get a system with a good upgrade path.<br/>
<br/>
My Emachine is 600 meg in speed, and maxes at 256 on memory. It does <br/>
not have an AGP slot, which limited me in selecting a video card. I <br/>
got it cheap, two years ago. Not a bad deal, but I have been playing <br/>
a losing game of catch-up with demands by improvements in EQ. The <br/>
most critical limitation of my machine was the memory. A large core <br/>
of memory is the most important factor in getting optimal performance.<br/>
<br/>
Even with the $1700 machine, after two years an upgrade to the second <br/>
from the top video card of that time would probably be less than $200.<br/>
That is not too bad.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, the closer you buy to the bottom of the performance <br/>
scale, the sooner upgrades will have to be made, and the fewer your <br/>
options when you choose to upgrade. This dance can be made to work by <br/>
those knowledgable in computer systems and components, but many <br/>
buyers will start with a less-than-optimally upgradable system by <br/>
seeking discounts and package systems. They may not have the <br/>
knowledge or their systems the option for adequate upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, there come significant changes to fundamental components <br/>
which alter the path of upgrades. For example, Nvidia is getting into <br/>
the motherboard market, which may alter standards for performance and <br/>
the options for upgrades. Also, some new ideas in video display are <br/>
coming forth. One new card allows you to view your game on three <br/>
monitors, giving a very wide surrounding view. This is new, and not <br/>
quite there, but will definitely affect the market and our upgrade <br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
Quite likely I will find a servicable machine next year for less than <br/>
my target of $1700. Perhaps I will get lucky and find a real bargain.<br/>
I am constantly learning, and might be savy enough to buy better next <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Still, the game plays well for me, and is very rewarding.<br/>

&gt; I see your point but I bought a machine for 600.00 a<br/>
&gt; few months ago and it runs EQ fine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is only a 1.2 Celeron with 300 and change RAM with<br/>
&gt; a 64 mb video card. I can play EQ and a First person<br/>
&gt; shooter with no hesitation at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Granted the bazaar gets a little laggy but everything<br/>
&gt; else is great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, an UBHA machine would be great but you can do<br/>
&gt; with much less.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps<br/>

&gt; &gt; I very much enjoy PC gaming. I also like to play on<br/>
&gt; &gt; consoles. I find <br/>
&gt; &gt; the style of game play is quite different in each<br/>
&gt; &gt; medium.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ultimately the consoles prove the easiest and least<br/>
&gt; &gt; expensive to buy <br/>
&gt; &gt; and upgrade. Generally a console and two games,<br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe a few more <br/>
&gt; &gt; items, can be had for $300.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It is hard to put a decent pc together for gaming<br/>
&gt; &gt; for under $1000. <br/>
&gt; &gt; About double that will net a decent machine with<br/>
&gt; &gt; upgrade potential, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but without the need to upgrade for some time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The upper end of pc gaming runs around $8000. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Obviously, more people can buy in for $300 than for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the $1000 plus.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Part of me wants to be a pc hotrodder, and build an<br/>
&gt; &gt; ubermachine. Big, <br/>
&gt; &gt; bad, and hot. With adequate cooling, as well. That<br/>
&gt; &gt; part of me does <br/>
&gt; &gt; not have access to the purse. Sadly, real life<br/>
&gt; &gt; expenses have first <br/>
&gt; &gt; claim on my wallet.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, I am watching the trends, and encouraging myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; to adopt the <br/>
&gt; &gt; philosophy that I am a gamer, and the platform is<br/>
&gt; &gt; less important than <br/>
&gt; &gt; the experience. It is within the scope of<br/>
&gt; &gt; possibility, and probably <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the path of great profitability for the makers,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that console <br/>
&gt; &gt; online multiplayer games will be of such game<br/>
&gt; &gt; quality in the future <br/>
&gt; &gt; that holding onto the pc platform will be only an<br/>
&gt; &gt; option, and not a <br/>
&gt; &gt; necessity.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Alternately, I can see online game manufacturers<br/>
&gt; &gt; selling systems to <br/>
&gt; &gt; insure their audience is there. Wouldn&#39;t that be<br/>
&gt; &gt; grand? Order the <br/>
&gt; &gt; game and the system all for one monthly payment.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Upgrade components <br/>
&gt; &gt; will be shipped when software demands require it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Your system will <br/>
&gt; &gt; always be current.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What will the future hold? I don&#39;t know, but I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure I cannot be <br/>
&gt; &gt; shelling out several thousand dollars every other<br/>
&gt; &gt; year. The cost has <br/>
&gt; &gt; to be brought in line with the spending capacity of<br/>
&gt; &gt; a large audience, <br/>
&gt; &gt; or else the hobby will suffer decline.<br/>
