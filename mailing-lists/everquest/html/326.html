<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275962501">The xp loss on death thing seems to be one of the greatest mysteries of the<br/>
game.  I&#39;m a LVL 11 (REAL close to 12) Bard - been spending the last several<br/>
levels hitting Orc an Dervish camps.  I&#39;ve been getting killed by these<br/>
critters (mostly con blue and white) and of course the obligatory deaths due<br/>
to Griffins and Sand Giants.  Last night got killed by a Ghoul in befallen<br/>
(not sure if that is red or yellow)...<br/>
<br/>
I am almost to the conclusion that they use a random number generator.<br/>
Sometimes I see a significant loss (close to if not a half-bubble) sometimes<br/>
it seems that I&#39;ve barely lost any.  Seems like I usually lose a lot when<br/>
getting chomped by the super-high-level ones (Griff/SG) and often not a lot<br/>
when its close to level as me (blue/white)<br/>
<br/>
Also - anecdotally it seems that if you die after dying recently you lose<br/>
more for that death than otherwise.  Perhaps some sort of timer?  But of<br/>
course - this could be coincidence - or again the random xp loss theory<br/>
could come into play here to...<br/>

&gt; I brought up this subject on the Stratics EQ chat room (irc.stratics.com<br/>
#Everquest) and it was pretty much agreed that the level of the MOB that<br/>
kill you has, at least, some effect on experience loss.  In fact, a couple<br/>
of the higher level players in the chat room (both of them claimed to be<br/>
30+) came back with an absolute YES.  The thinking is that at lower levels<br/>
(say 6-15), the level of MOB that would probably kill you is going to be<br/>
higher than you.  At these levels, &quot;blues&quot; are not difficult to defeat.  At<br/>
higher levels, MOBS than con blue to you (meaning lower level than you) are<br/>
far more dangerous and can easily<br/>
