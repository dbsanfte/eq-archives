&gt; OK OK,  I was playing &quot;casually&quot; for a bulk of the<br/>
&gt; time.  New<br/>
&gt; business..personal BS...blah blah blah.  But<br/>
&gt; generally I was working on<br/>
&gt; Fletching and exploring as many places as I could. <br/>
&gt; But consider this.<br/>
&gt; After all of that time exploring  and learning about<br/>
&gt; the game I became able<br/>
&gt; to start a new character and level him to 26 in<br/>
&gt; about two weeks of playing.<br/>
&gt; Not bad me thinks.  Playing casually makes it hard<br/>
&gt; to gain levels.  Spend<br/>
&gt; too much time travelling and looking for groups etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Playing full time now though! YAY!<br/>
