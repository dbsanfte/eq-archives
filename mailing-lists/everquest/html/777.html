<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475518266">Speaking from personal experience, clarity is asked for quite often by other <br/>
spell casters including hybrids. I don&#39;t know for sure how useful it is at <br/>
higher levels, but I can say that clarity has thus far been a a major boon <br/>
from level 20 to 32.<br/>
<br/>
As to finding groups at higher levels, if you&#39;re in the right places, <br/>
finding a group about your current level is easily done. In fact, I&#39;ve found <br/>
that it&#39;s easier getting a group by not being set /role or /anon unless you <br/>
wish to either roleplay or be left alone. Hope you find this info useful. <br/>
Good hunting!<br/>

&gt;I agree that the list has died, but anyways I got a question for all you<br/>
&gt;enchanters out there...<br/>
&gt;I am halfway into 28, would have hit 29 but I am cautious and I like to <br/>
&gt;play<br/>
&gt;around (all guards except highpass hate my 24 illusions... hehe).... How<br/>
&gt;often do people ask you for clarity? and how hard would it be to get a <br/>
&gt;group<br/>
&gt;after achieving 29? and last.... do you recommend going /anon or /role?<br/>
&gt;Thanks in advance...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
