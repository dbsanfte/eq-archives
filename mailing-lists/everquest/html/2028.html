<div id="ygrps-yiv-603177067">As a paying customer, I do not want EQ to just survive. I want EQ to strive<br/>
to be the best game available. No one wants to play a so-so game. I can<br/>
guarantee you, EQ would not be afloat if they had not made any or even a few<br/>
of the upgrades / expansions they have done. I would hate to think of 3<br/>
years of EQ with no upgrades or expansions. Do you honestly think EQ would<br/>
still be played to today if it were still the original EQ of 3 years ago?<br/>
NOWAY ! EQ would be around right now. But since Verant choose to continue to<br/>
grow, they still have a strong player base. Sure, some might quit due to the<br/>
new requirements, but it is better than being out of business if they&#39;d sat<br/>
on their ass and count the money for the first 1 year. <br/>
<br/>
Thank God Su was not a VP at Verant at the time of EverQuest release or we&#39;d<br/>
be lining up to kill Vox and Naggy for the 1,000,000th time. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really want Verant to waste my $9.95 a month trying to figure out a<br/>
way for DirectX8 to work on your 8 MB video card or your neighbors WIN95<br/>
system. I hope they spend my monthly service fee making the game better. I<br/>
hope they keep upgrading the EQ world. You notice, this is the exact<br/>
opposite things you want. Change is good when it comes in the form of an<br/>
upgrade :-) I think that for every person that quits EQ because of the new<br/>
requirements, they keep 2 people playing for months longer by making the<br/>
more enjoyable. People will and do quit after doing everything there is to<br/>
do in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
It is crazy for people to think that a company should hold back and try not<br/>
to be the best game out on the market. As time goes on the bar that games<br/>
get measured on will continue to grow. As it grows, new requirements are not<br/>
an option, but a necessity, a must. Once Verant knew the release of DirectX<br/>
8, they knew that they MUST use DirectX8 if they wanted to continue to move<br/>
forward and strive to be the best game out on the market. As a paying<br/>
customer, (some paying more than others) you would have to be crazy not to<br/>
want the same thing. I love the new graphics and sure, I had to do some<br/>
upgrading, but damn, look at the zones today compared to 3 years ago, what a<br/>
change. <br/>
<br/>
I guess you really don&#39;t understand Su, these changes are really not for the<br/>
fun of it or for show. They are a must. The vast majority of Verant&#39;s<br/>
customer base demands that Verant provides the best game possible. The best<br/>
graphics, the best detail, the best way to interact with the fellow players,<br/>
the best dynamic role playing world and the best customer service. Do I<br/>
think Verant is the best at all these? No, but atleast I know they are<br/>
striving to be the best. Verant knew that without DirectX8, they couldn&#39;t be<br/>
the best for long. As time goes on, all the best games will be running the<br/>
current DirectX. <br/>
<br/>
SoL left 2 out 3 of my household computers unplayable. My son, who also<br/>
plays EQ, doesn&#39;t have a playable computer now. Even though Verant might<br/>
have released SoL a little early and untested, I am happy they released when<br/>
they did, just before Christmas. Perfect timing for the many people that<br/>
will ask their parents, spouses, grandparents, aunts and uncles ( Mu, Chase<br/>
needs another stick of RAM for Christmas ) for their upgrades. Computers get<br/>
outdated just like games do and if expect to play the most popular games,<br/>
you&#39;ll have to keep your machine updated. Just be thankful computer<br/>
components are cheep. I still feel like crying when I think about the money<br/>
I spent on my computer I bought in 1993 or 94. Pakard Bell system for<br/>
$3,400. WOW what I could do with that money today.<br/>
<br/>
The question you should ask yourself is, do you want to play the best game<br/>
available or do you want to play just a so-so game. Maybe Verant is not the<br/>
company for you, but they&#39;re the company for me, they keep pushing the<br/>
envelope. As long as I choose to spend my &quot;relaxing&quot; free time in the world<br/>
of EverQuest, I pray that Verant will continue to strive to be the best,<br/>
even if this means an upgrade here or there, I&#39;ll be there.<br/>
<br/>
By no means is this an insult on you Su, I just really don&#39;t see your view<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, this email is so long. I&#39;m bored at work and this is my last day<br/>
before I start my holiday vacation. I hope I don&#39;t have 200 + emails in my<br/>
box when I return in 2002.<br/>

<br/>
	I understand you feel strongly about this, but you don&#39;t need to<br/>
resort to<br/>
	insulting people.<br/>
	EQ could easily survive if they didn&#39;t constantly change the<br/>
graphics and<br/>
	such on the game bc the game is so dynamic with so many places to<br/>
explore<br/>
	and things to do that they could leave it the same way for 3 years<br/>
and many<br/>
	people would be happy.<br/>
	Developing things for old tech, so long as it will work with new<br/>
tech is<br/>
	smart. It gives them a broader customer base. Have you ever taken<br/>
any<br/>
	business classes?<br/>
	-Su<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	Sorry Su, but here&#39;s your tissue.<br/>
<br/>
	Gawd damn you whine alot.<br/>
<br/>
	Some facts:<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;are you saying that people with more money are more important?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	Yes, a customer with money is alot more important to a company that<br/>
is<br/>
	trying to make a good earning than a customer without money. A<br/>
customer with<br/>
	money adds a flavor of long lasting customer relation ships. You<br/>
however,<br/>
	doesn&#39;t meet these standards (you self who said it). So, you think<br/>
Verant<br/>
	should keep the old game just cause some of the old customers, who<br/>
btw<br/>
	bought this game which clearly stated on the bottom of the box that<br/>
OS and<br/>
	hardware requirments could/will change, can&#39;t pay for the new produc<br/>
that.<br/>
	You know the product that will keep EQ alive and not let it die<br/>
before the<br/>
	end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
	Get real Su, if they wouldn&#39;t have updated EQ they wouldnt survive a<br/>
month.<br/>
	A company that chose to develop shit for a old tech ain&#39;t a company<br/>
with a<br/>
	long lasting future.<br/>

	Ämne: Re: [EverQuest] I hate Shadows of Luclin and I don&#39;t even own<br/>
it<br/>
	yet...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	I have seen my friend&#39;s computer run. Trust me, it can&#39;t handle<br/>
Luclin. It<br/>
	probably can&#39;t handle velious come to think of it. But now that I<br/>
think<br/>
	about it, his system is probably considered obsolete to most<br/>
&quot;serious<br/>
	gamers&quot;.<br/>
	Don&#39;t mind me. I&#39;m stressed out bc my neighbor stole stuff from me<br/>
and had<br/>
	the gall to cuss at my mother when she asked where the stuff was<br/>
when he was<br/>
	the only one who could&#39;ve taken it. (and so I don&#39;t sound like I&#39;m<br/>
just<br/>
	jumping to conclusions, he was a tenant in our house for awhile and<br/>
alot of<br/>
	the stuff we left in his care is gone).<br/>
	*sigh*<br/>
	going through unpacking hell right now. moving sucks.<br/>
