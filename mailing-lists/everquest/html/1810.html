<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069613350">I am not too crazy about using damage shields on very low level players to<br/>
help them power-level, because the newbie mobs often kill themselves on the<br/>
damage shields before you can even get in one damage point. When soloing,<br/>
you have to inflict at least one damage on a mob to get exp. for killing it.<br/>
<br/>
I know I always hated it when a well-meaning druid would cast Shield of<br/>
Spikes or whatever on my newbie characters. Gray wolf, orc pawn, fire<br/>
beetle, bat, goblin whelp etc. -- attack, bingo dead time after time without<br/>
me getting exp for it.<br/>
<br/>
Skin and regen is much more helpful, as well as standing by and healing at<br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion only =)<br/>

&gt; Well, I don&#39;t know much about melee myself either but I can say that<br/>
&gt; you can DS (Damage Shield) your hubby to power level him as well as<br/>
&gt; give him Skin Like Rock.  Also, buff him up with strength so he can<br/>
&gt; deal more damage.  I&#39;m really not sure if fearing is very effective<br/>
&gt; to PL because when I tried doing that, they didn&#39;t seem to get much<br/>
&gt; xp out of it.  Well, I can definitely help your hubby get to your<br/>
&gt; level if you&#39;re on Vazaelle.  I doubt it though.  Not many poeple<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen online post that they&#39;re on vazaelle.  Cuz I can definitely<br/>
&gt; help him level.  I&#39;m a level 51 druid and I can use my 49 DS and<br/>
&gt; he&#39;ll kill mobs like they were nothing.  It deals 24 points of damage<br/>
&gt; each time the mob hits the person with the DS.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if some of you could help me.  I got my hubby<br/>
&gt; involved in EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; so he&#39;d stop bugging me to get off the computer.  He&#39;s got a 10th<br/>
&gt; lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt; halfling fighter, and I know next to nothing about the melee<br/>
&gt; classes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Assuming he&#39;s got about 1000pp to spend, what are his best choices<br/>
&gt; for armor<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a decent weapon.  He&#39;s got a fine steel longsword right now,<br/>
&gt; which seems<br/>
&gt; &gt; to suck, and leather armor.  Should he go to bronze or fine steel<br/>
&gt; armor?<br/>
&gt; &gt; What does a full suit of either of these cost?  And what&#39;s the best<br/>
&gt; weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt; for him at this point?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, I&#39;m trying to powerlevel him just a little so we can go<br/>
&gt; adventuring<br/>
&gt; &gt; together, though I&#39;m not generally a fan of leveling people that<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; &gt; what they&#39;re doing.  They should die plenty and learn like the rest<br/>
&gt; of us<br/>
&gt; &gt; did :P  I have a 16 druid and he just needs a couple of levels so<br/>
&gt; we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; hang out.  Is there a good place to do this quickly?  All I can<br/>
&gt; think of at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the moment is to fear kite lions and bears, oh my, and let him hack<br/>
&gt; them up.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There&#39;s so darn many people in EC these days, though.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any help!!<br/>
