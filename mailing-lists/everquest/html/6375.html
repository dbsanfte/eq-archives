<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057743421">Howdy All:<br/>
REALLY GLAD to see a new group---the only reason I joined the old <br/>
group was to find people who were experienced in EQ and could help out <br/>
in a crisis--not to see all that spam mail.  <br/>
I&#39;m having a crisis now.  My friend did the POStorms key (beard, bone <br/>
sash, 2 medallions) however, it looks like he never got credit for <br/>
doing the turn in and the seer gives him a message that the 2 <br/>
medallions have not been turned in.  Is it possible that the <br/>
medallions he gave to Askr the Lost came from the same camp and that <br/>
is why he has not been given credit ??? We have tried to &quot;rehail&quot; askr <br/>
but he just gives a message to move along. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks All <br/>
