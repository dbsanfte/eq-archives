<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918682507">OK, You can train your trade skills ( baking, Tailoring, ect) To <br/>
21 and after a few free points it does start charging. Languages and <br/>
other skills like 1 hb 2 hb and slashing can be trained way on past <br/>
21 at your trainer depending on your level.  My druid has always used <br/>
a 1hb When I decided to het a scimitar at lv 48 I trained as high as <br/>
I could and it was costing several plat a point  I paid over a <br/>
hundred to gain skill level at trainer.  <br/>
    I have been on almost 4 years and it has been this way the entire <br/>
time I have  played. I beleive the reason trade skills are capped at <br/>
21 is to create player based economy for and to reward those willing <br/>
to go out and put the work in something.<br/>
