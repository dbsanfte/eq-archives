<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999395768">Hi. My pet and I have been killing Greater Scalebones and Greater <br/>
Skeletons in Kurn&#39;s Tower. Started there 2 days ago at level 14, and <br/>
am now a couple small bubbles from 18. I have been donating for a KEI <br/>
buff in PoK before I go there, and in turn have been casting Breeze, <br/>
Mist, Strength, Rune I, Quickness, and Intellectual Advancement <br/>
spells on other players in Kurn&#39;s to try and help them out.<br/>
<br/>
I have been buffing my pet with Mist, Strength, Quickness, Rune I, <br/>
and myself with those buffs plus Intellectual Advancement and <br/>
Shielding. I use Root when there is only one target around, and Mez <br/>
on a target when there are others in the area. Then I hit them with <br/>
Chaotic Feedback and Choke, alternating until the target breaks the <br/>
Mez/Root and then my pet finishes it off. I read somewhere that this <br/>
is called &quot;Root and Nuke&quot; and that it isn&#39;t very effective. I am <br/>
wondering if there are other ways I should be going about trying to <br/>
fight as opposed to this? Should I be using my dagger in combination <br/>
to the rooting/nuking? Any feedback would be great. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
