&gt; I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though. Plus EQ2 could be <br/>
&gt; considered a parrallel universe.<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t know Luclin had exploded in EQ2. Did they say the story behind <br/>
&gt; why? What happened to the poor Vah Shir?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seems according to Sony&#39;s plans the Vah Shir were all wiped out when it <br/>
went.  But dont worry you can still be a cat in the game, just as a Kerra. <br/>
Kerra were originally (by EQ lore) 4 tribes that united as one.  The Vah <br/>
Shir were only 1 of those 4.  When they got blown to the moon the other 3 <br/>
seperated going to the 3 areas they flurish in EQ, Kerra Isle, Erud&#39;s <br/>
Crossing, and Stonebrunt Mountains.  But don&#39;t count the Vah Shir bloodlines <br/>
out yet, they could have had some living with the Kerra on Norrath when <br/>
Luclin went boom.  As for why it went boom....I&#39;m still looking for lore on <br/>
that. <br/>
