<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-246855420">Ooh, I like the idea about the armor mold shapes and such. I like how in<br/>
Morrowind there are user created mods to make armor look different if you<br/>
want. It would be cool if users could submit new designs for armor and<br/>
clothes to the game creators<br/>
so they could decide whether or not to add it. Only thing is, it would<br/>
require more system resources to label what design is available for what<br/>
piece of armor.<br/>
I saw a rainbow colored robe/dress in a catalog and thought it would be<br/>
hilarious to see that on a player in game.<br/>

&gt; A game feature I&#39;d like to see is customer service *grin*  but since EQ is<br/>
&gt; all about making the game fair and equal as possible (nerfing items and so<br/>
&gt; on) I&#39;d like to see some equality in the races..I mean the evil races get<br/>
&gt; the 2 biggest and baddest races in the game while the good races get the<br/>
&gt; smartest..why not make them all equal?  Another thing I&#39;d think would be<br/>
&gt; cool is a feature that relates to the armor dyes..molding, and tailoring<br/>
