<br/>
Well, since Sony cant help me.. I am looking for a kind soul that<br/>
has extra time, and willing to aid fellow adventurers.<br/>
<br/>
I have problem patching the huge files.. mainly eqgame.exe<br/>
eqfeartintro.pak nedaria.s3d etc etc<br/>
<br/>
I mean, using eq own default patch program, those files took ages..<br/>
and if I somehow manage to get the files I needed posted on a<br/>
website.. it will help me a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I had to quit 3 years ago, when Warrens and Stoneburnt (those<br/>
optional download zones) came out and I cant download it..<br/>
<br/>
A friend used to help me by sending emails containing particular big<br/>
files (over 1mb gives me problems, as my isp somehow limit/time my<br/>
d/l if it took too long/over 1mb files) and somehow I manage to<br/>
finished patching.<br/>
<br/>
I am not on a 56k modem, but using a CDMA phone connection that<br/>
supposedly have 260k speed (but honestly the max I ever got was 80k,<br/>
twice the speed of dial up).. and if I dont use software like<br/>
download accelerator, then files will be downloaded at such a<br/>
horrible speed that 1mb will took 10 hours, but if using those 3rd<br/>
party software to somehow &quot;trick&quot; my isp insane firewall.. then I<br/>
can easily d/l 4mb-10mb per hour.<br/>
<br/>
So.. what I am asking for help is.. please, could anybody be as so<br/>
kind as to post/upload to a free website the eqfeartintros.pak which<br/>
server shows as 1377409 big and ldonequip.s3d server 1133942. I have<br/>
many more files I had not manage to d/l. But once I manage to d/l<br/>
these 2 files, 3mb big which will take me upmost of 2 hours with d/l<br/>
express (best booster soft!).. then I will update these kind folks,<br/>
thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I apologise if im hard to understand.. yep, im in my confused and<br/>
weakened state as it has taken me 3days of phonecalls, browsing net<br/>
to find solution (mess with MTU, ping, tracert, sent sony countless<br/>
patch server date, and it somehows shows sonyonline.net should share<br/>
the problems too).. so sorry and please accept my thanks if anyone<br/>
can help. Thank You (I would gladly pass a Velious keycode)<br/>
