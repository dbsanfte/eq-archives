  <p><em>Ok I had never thought about getting my account &quot;hacked&quot; into. &nbsp;I 
  would have <br>thought that as long as I didn&#39;t give out my information that I 
  would be <br>safe.</em></p>
  <p>That&#39;s cause you are safe..&nbsp; The odds of anyone hacking your system.. 
  or anyone else&#39;s system just to get your everquest account is next to 
  nothing.&nbsp; Sure it happens every now and then due to the lack of players 
  realizing their personal responsibility to protect themselves on the 
  Internet.&nbsp; If your handing your account information out to other 
  players/not running uptodate anti-virus programs/personal firewalls/etc. 
  then&nbsp;they have no one to blame but themselves.&nbsp; There&#39;s certainly 
  more personal information about them that would be more important 
  to&nbsp;&quot;hackers&quot; other then your Everquest account.&nbsp; Those protection 
  programs are easy to install and maintain - most are automatic with the least 
  amount of input from the end-user.&nbsp; If someone is &quot;sniffing&quot; the packets 
  from your computer, you&#39;ve got a much larger problem then worrying if they 
  have compromised your EQ account.</p>
