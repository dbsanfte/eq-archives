<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444375195">Thanks, all, for your responses. Since I can only add pci to my cheap <br/>
system (looked so nice last year when I knew so little) and my memory <br/>
is maxed at 256 (I really knew way too little), I may follow the <br/>
advice to wait for the 4 to come out and grab a 3 at discount.<br/>
<br/>
Or I could win the lottery and buy a real computer.<br/>

&gt; I have an Nvidia tnt2 64 graphics card. PCI. I have seen the gforce <br/>

of <br/>
&gt; lag in Rivervale, most of Luclin, and some of the other cities. Not <br/>
&gt; everywhere, just where lots of people gather and the backgrounds <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; graphics intensive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have the money to go for the gforce 3, and I don&#39;t even <br/>
know <br/>
&gt; if the 3 comes in pci format. I need another hard disk as well as <br/>
&gt; doing a graphics upgrade, so the money needs to stay around that <br/>
$45.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would want a very obvious improvement to even bother with the <br/>
&gt; upgrade on the graphics.<br/>
