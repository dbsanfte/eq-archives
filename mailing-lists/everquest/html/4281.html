<div id="ygrps-yiv-963134105">Here we go again, insulting people who ask for help. Maybe she honestly <br/>
didn&#39;t know that all of the CD keys were different, but it is assumed that <br/>
she is trying to scam people out of their accounts. Give her credit! This is <br/>
why I left the group the first time, because people assumed the worst and <br/>
instead of explaining things NICELY.<br/>
<br/>
First off, the CD keys are all different. I don&#39;t know who told you they <br/>
were the same or why.<br/>
<br/>
Second off, old accounts can NOT be reactivated just like that. EverQuest <br/>
holds onto your unused and unpaid for accounts for six months before <br/>
deleting it.<br/>
