<div id="ygrps-yiv-591532814">Thank you Lori. I appreciate you using full word spelling. For some reason<br/>
the abbreviations annoy the hell out of some people. I can stand it to some<br/>
extent but sometimes it annoys me. :-)<br/>
I do use some abbreviations like bc when typing, but try not to have every<br/>
word in a sentence abbreviated. Well, it works in groups when you have to<br/>
type really fast. :-)<br/>
Cool. I vaguely remember 9th grade. It sucked. lol.<br/>
I bet it&#39;s fun being on summer vacation. :-)<br/>
What server do you play on?<br/>
luv,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>so.......while i am typeing email&#39;s to you all at least. But my friends have<br/>
probably gotten used to me typeing that way so i am going to keep typeing on<br/>
eq. But ok see .......am I typeing ok so far?? any way, I just  think it is<br/>
easier and faster so people dont have to wait forever to hear a response<br/>
when they want it and especially while they are excited...am I correct? I am<br/>
14 years old and going on 9th grade, k-6 is elementry for me and 7 and 8 are<br/>
middle school and 9-12 is high school..........so I have been going to<br/>
school around 10 or 11 years, my mom put me in school when I was 5 years<br/>
old. Ok is everything all cleared up and all or does some one else have a<br/>
problem or challenge for me?<br/>

&gt; I thought this was kind of funny actually.  I don&#39;t recall ever taking<br/>

assumed that if we made it that far then we already knew how to spell.  So<br/>
if this person is still in that phase of his/her life where Spelling is a<br/>
major subject of study then I could believe &quot;whole life&quot; could equal 10<br/>
years!<br/>

&gt; I agree with Jerry, though, who stated in another email that if you do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that by habit, then you&#39;ll find yourself doing it when you shouldn&#39;t.  It&#39;s<br/>
best to learn proper spelling and grammar skills first and make them a<br/>
habit.  Then you can use your internet-ese for fun.  Worst thing you could<br/>
do is turn in a research paper for your professor that&#39;s full of<br/>
abbreviations and misspellings, or perhaps be making a big presentation at<br/>
work and have that kind of spelling and grammar.  Nobody would take you<br/>
seriously.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; There are a few reasons why people type like that: 1.  Because they don&#39;t<br/>

chat room is moving, 2.  Because they really don&#39;t know how to spell or how<br/>
to use proper grammar, and/or 3.  They think it&#39;s cool when it&#39;s really not.<br/>
Which one are you?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You learned to spell for a reason.  You say you&#39;re good at it.  So use it.<br/>

&gt; What was your grade in reading comprehension? I was saying that you could<br/>
&gt; spell correctly but that you were purposely misspelling things for fun.<br/>
&gt; I had assumed you were doing it to make fun of people who type like that.<br/>
&gt; :-)<br/>
&gt; If I were a mean person I&#39;d ask if your whole life was 10 years. ;-D<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt; &gt; words misspelled asking me why I ask people to spell things correctly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just a joke to make fun of people who can&#39;t spell.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; PLEASE.... in the name of all that is holy... could you learn to spell<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; complete words? Is it really that difficult? &quot;R&quot; is not a word...<br/>
&gt; neither<br/>
&gt; &gt; is<br/>
