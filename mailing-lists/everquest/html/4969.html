game feature I&#39;d like to see is customer service *grin*&nbsp; but since EQ is 
all about making the game fair and equal as possible (nerfing items and so on) 
I&#39;d like to see some equality in the races..I mean the evil races get the 2 
biggest and baddest races in the game while the good races get the smartest..why 
not make them all equal?&nbsp; Another thing I&#39;d think would be cool is a 
feature that relates to the armor dyes..molding, and tailoring any piece of gear 
you own to your own liking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like say if you were a ogre warrior and 
you didn&#39;t like the way&nbsp;your helmet looked like, well you could go down to 
a forge or blacksmith and pay a certain amount to have them mold the helmet 
anyway you would like..maybe you would like horns on the helmet or a certain 
design ecthed on it..and for casters you could go to a tailor somewhere and have 
them design your robe a certain way..maybe you would like longer sleeves or a 
slit in your robe or a fancy collar.&nbsp; </font></span></div>
