<div id="ygrps-yiv-456570549">I have been gone from EQ for a long time ( a year in MAY). I have <br/>
played occasionally since then, but never &quot;full-time&quot; since MAY like <br/>
I used to...I hear something have changed<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone give me a list or such of the thinngs that have changed <br/>
since May of last year..I know of a couple expansions..but not sure <br/>
much else. I want to be informed before i return to EQ <br/>
again &quot;fulltime&quot; and not feel like a newb again (is a nasty feeling)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
