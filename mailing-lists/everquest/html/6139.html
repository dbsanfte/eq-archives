I went to login to check my email and apparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea why. Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with my brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not I want to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a higher price. I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me off that they pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an angry letter of complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br>ARG.
