<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534614062"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;The Nexus doesn&#39;t go to West Commonlands. It goes to<br/>
&gt; &gt;North Karana via the Antonica Scion. In which case<br/>
&gt; *grin* Shows how much I go to Luclin. (worst expansion<br/>
&gt; yet? in a word... YES.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually like it so far. the newbie area is pretty cool. lots of things to<br/>
do and quests to do. there&#39;s an outdoor bank, merchants. all kinds of cool<br/>
stuff. and you don&#39;t have to worry about falling to your death like in<br/>
Kelethin.<br/>
I also like how berries just spawn on the ground for you to pickup. sure you<br/>
still have to buy drink but there&#39;s plenty of free food around.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;you have to go through East Karana, Highpass,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and then West Commons. I think it&#39;s actually safer<br/>
&gt; With a Camo and not travelling thru Kithicor at night<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s not too bad a run, but pestering a druid for a<br/>
&gt; camo and hoping it doesn&#39;t wear off is a hassle. The<br/>
&gt; boat is probabl a better plan. The other option is<br/>
&gt; shelling the ten plat to get a port from a Druid or<br/>
&gt; Wizzy to WC. Much faster. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or find a kind druid or wizzy who will do it for free or small donation.<br/>
