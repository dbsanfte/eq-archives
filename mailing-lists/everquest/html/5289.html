&gt; Iksar Monk but have been playing my 5 Wood Elf Ranger lately.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My ranger has a quiver that he keeps his arrows in.  I saw a tip when<br/>
&gt; I logged on that says keeping arrows in a quiver decreases attack<br/>
&gt; time.  I can not get him to draw from his quiver.  The only arrows he<br/>
&gt; uses are in the ammo slot.  The quiver will not fit in the ammo slot.<br/>
&gt; If I have no arrows in the ammo slot I get a message &quot;Out Of<br/>
&gt; Ammunition&quot; when I try and use my bow, even with my quiver full.  I<br/>
&gt; have tried putting the quiver on my back and it won&#39;t fit there<br/>
&gt; either.  I have asked a bunch of people in game with no luck,<br/>
&gt; searched the web and looked in my hint book.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Put a stack of arrows in your ammo slot, and a quiver in your inventory.<br/>
You get haste just by having the quiver, and if you have more than one<br/>
quiver it uses the haste from the one nearest the top left slot in your<br/>
inventory. It doesn&#39;t matter if the arrows are being drawn from a stack<br/>
in your quiver or another back, it just looks for a quiver to see if you<br/>
get any haste.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have shot the last arrow in your ammo slot it looks for a stack<br/>
of *identical* arrows sored in your inventory, and if it finds any it<br/>
moves a single arrow from your inventory to the ammo slot. If it doesn&#39;t<br/>
find an identical arrow, your get an out of ammo message, even if you<br/>
are carrying lots of other types of arrows. To use these other arrows<br/>
you would need to put at least one into the ammo slot manually.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; While on the subject of archers, my bow and arrows each have a range<br/>
&gt; and damage rating.  My bow is Range 75 Damage 8 (I think).  My arrows<br/>
&gt; are Range 25 Damage 1.  What is my range and damage?  100 and 9 by<br/>
&gt; adding the numbers, 25 and 1 taking the lower of each?  Something<br/>
&gt; else?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You add the numbers for damage and range from both bow and arrow in use<br/>
to get the final result. A 3 damage 150 range Arrow with a 20damage 200<br/>
range bow gives 23 base damage and 350 range<br/>
