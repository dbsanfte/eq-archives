<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434566594">Sorry to be such a pessimist, but I personally think the &quot;NO DROP, NO<br/>
TRADE, LORE ITEM&quot; was put in to help stop the Camping issue. If a<br/>
person cannot sell these items then why stick around and camp the<br/>
site where these items spawn.<br/>
<br/>
I know there will be the idea that a group can go in and camp the item, <br/>
but when all that group has the item, then they too will move on. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am wrong, but I thought Brad was the one with this idea about<br/>
the Lore Items and was going to help out people camping.<br/>

&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a new survey for the EverQuest community. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;More and more items are becoming NO DROP now, meaning you cannot trade or sell them, and since Verant pushes forward about the game having a &quot;player based economy&quot;, the NO DROP items really ruin this concept.. There is a way to prevent &quot;twinking&quot; and still have the items availible for trade, an alternative to NO DROP. Put level blocks on equipment, meaning you cannot use/wear the equipment until you are high enough level for the item, the level will be somewhere below the level you need to get it. </span></blockquote></div>
