&gt; Sounds weird, I sent a petition in game about it and the GM told me<br/>
&gt; to ask other Enchanters about it? That was no help. Has anyone else<br/>
&gt; had stats show up in their inventory window different than what the<br/>
&gt; item is supposed to show?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I note that the first item has a small amount of Agility on it... it may<br/>
be pushing just over the mid 70&#39;s agility threshold thus giving you a<br/>
dramatic boost in AC. What is your Agi when wearing both items?<br/>
