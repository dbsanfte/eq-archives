<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-61424102">I have seen a lot of people with guild names on my server and I was really <br/>
wondering what the benefit of being in a guild would be to going it without <br/>
one???<br/>
<br/>
I mean I can always find someone to group with... or solo it on the blue&#39;s <br/>
and blacks....<br/>
<br/>
Other then maybe another aspect added to the role playing game what benefit <br/>
do you recieve from a Guild.<br/>
<br/>
ok got to run just wondering<br/>
<br/>
