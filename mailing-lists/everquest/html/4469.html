&gt; I&#39;ve pondered for awhile.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My rogue is level 32.  I play him infrequently.  At<br/>
&gt; level 30 rogues get all the skills they are going to<br/>
&gt; get.  Rogues are non-casters so they don&#39;t have new<br/>
&gt; spells to look forward to.  The only things rogues<br/>
&gt; have to look forward to are their disciplines at<br/>
&gt; level 50.  So how does one get from level 30 to<br/>
&gt; level 50 in the shortest amount of time possible? <br/>
&gt; Whenever I play, it seems like I always have a hard<br/>
&gt; time finding a group.  I&#39;m looking in places like<br/>
&gt; Frontier Mountains, The Overthere, and Dawnshroud<br/>
&gt; Peaks.  I&#39;m not high enough level that I can easily<br/>
&gt; solo any mobs in either of those zones. But nobody<br/>
&gt; seems to want to group.  So are there any zones<br/>
&gt; where I can get quick xp by soloing?  Or are there<br/>
&gt; other zones I could try for groups?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hate for my rogue to fall by the way side because<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s become a bore to play.  So any suggestions you<br/>
&gt; have for playing rogue characters to help me out<br/>
&gt; would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>
