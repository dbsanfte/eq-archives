<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043293847">Well, there were only 2 places I wanted to hunt. I needed deathfist slashed<br/>
belts. And I wasn&#39;t going to give up a spanw point bc he was a jerk. I was<br/>
tough enough that I wouldn&#39;t be killed easily. I didn&#39;t die even once<br/>
despite the lack of healing. I needed the practice for being in group with<br/>
no healers. Besides, until it was just me and him in group it was fun. Then<br/>
I ditched him to group with my guildmate and we took the camp together<br/>
(since the jerk was dead).<br/>
It was worth it.<br/>

Honestly, Su, I would *never* have stayed in that group.  If you&#39;re there<br/>
for exp, how good is the exp if you keep dying because the main healer won&#39;t<br/>
heal you (I know you didn&#39;t die but you very easily could have)?  I would<br/>
never stay if I wasn&#39;t absolutely sure the healer wouldn&#39;t do everything in<br/>
his power to keep me alive, tank or not.  I&#39;m sure there were other open<br/>
spots at camps nearby you could have gone to.  That guy sounds like a<br/>
5-yr-old brat, and I&#39;d put him on ignore -- someday he&#39;ll need something<br/>
from you!  :)<br/>

This reminds me.. Recently I was in a group and they refused to do alpha<br/>
loot. But I needed the xp and faction so I stayed. I was getting to loot a<br/>
little bit but then one of the members looked at my gear and suddenly<br/>
decided that I didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; money or items bc I already had &quot;good stuff&quot;.<br/>
Nevermind that I had to work my ass off to get the money to buy the stuff<br/>
and had no money left to buy spells or better items. I don&#39;t know where he<br/>
got off. I mean, I wasn&#39;t even getting xp from most of the stuff while he<br/>
was and he would&#39;ve been dead 10 times over if I hadn&#39;t saved him by using<br/>
DDs to kill stuff before it could kill him. So he expected me to gain<br/>
nothing but faction? Such a jerk. And the worst part was, he was main healer<br/>
yet he refused to heal me when I had 1 bub of life left. He had 3 bubs of<br/>
life yet and started healing HIMSELF while I was near death. He wasn&#39;t even<br/>
getting aggrod on at the time. I was only injured so much bc I pulled some<br/>
orcs off of him so they wouldn&#39;t kill him. When I asked him nicely for a<br/>
heal he said &quot;I heal the tanks first-- and I&#39;m the only one injured&quot;. I<br/>
responded with &quot;I think I did a pretty good job of tanking&quot;. I didn&#39;t get<br/>
healed til another person who wasn&#39;t in a group ran by and stopped to heal<br/>
me.<br/>
Luckily a guildmate of mine showed up and invited me to join his group. The<br/>
jerk was left on his own and he stupidly tried to attack the entire large<br/>
orc camp (in EC) on his own. I watched him die (nothing I could do about it<br/>
really).<br/>
Oh well.. don&#39;t mind me. just rambling.<br/>
luv,<br/>
