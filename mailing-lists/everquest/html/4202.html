<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808689240">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I need some help on my next MPORPG purchase. I played EQ since Beta <br/>
and quit about 2 and half years ago (college took priority heh) and <br/>
now that I have secured a somewhat stable career, I&#39;m planning to hit <br/>
online RPGing again. Question is, being that EQ has been out for 5 <br/>
years, is it too late to come back and start anew? Meaning am I going <br/>
to look ridiculous (prolly will regardless) being the only lvl 6 guy <br/>
on the server in cloth and using fine steel? Or should I look for <br/>
another MRORPG game? How is Camelot? Or Neverwinter Nights?<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
