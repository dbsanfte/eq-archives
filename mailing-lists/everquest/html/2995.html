<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886151638">What is the goal with the guild? There are many without a set goal just<br/>
inviting people randomly for no apparent reason.<br/>
<br/>
The most important things that needs to be adressed by a guild is:<br/>
<br/>
Handling of loot (this is a central driving force for many playing eq, like<br/>
it or not)<br/>
Leading events/Raids<br/>
Handling of recruiting<br/>
Selling off uneeded loot to finance guild<br/>
<br/>
The most common misconception (in my opinion) is that cause youre a part of<br/>
a guild you get groups and items for free. You dont. You work for them and<br/>
sometimes group within guild sometimes outside. <br/>
<br/>
Also running a guild costs in game money. Make sure guild is well on<br/>
finances so you can give clerics/chanters/wizards/magicians reagents for<br/>
raiding and not worry about beeing broke all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Structure and leadership organization. How many officers, what do they do,<br/>
is there a set chain of command. Democracy is good, but not in all<br/>
questions. The larger you get the more likely that one person doesnt like<br/>
another, this happens but they still need to be able to respect each other.<br/>
Differences in opinions and personality exists, deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
To simplify these tasks its much easier to have offline boards that can<br/>
handle organizational tasks apart from the online enjoyment. This is pretty<br/>
much the same as playing for a team in any sport that requires 10+ people.<br/>
How well everyone understands and likes the goal of the guild will determine<br/>
how successful you are. Its a bit harder here cause things that are written<br/>
can easily be misunderstood cause of age and language differences. Be very<br/>
clear, try to print a set of rules or guildelines. <br/>
<br/>
Encourage people to be a part of the team...<br/>
<br/>
Just some small tips from the top of my head.<br/>
