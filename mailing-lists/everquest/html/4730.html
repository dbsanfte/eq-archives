<div id="ygrps-yiv-772891360">So, another expansion pack is coming out. The features listed look pretty<br/>
cool.<br/>
I&#39;ll be interested to see how they are implemented and how they work in the<br/>
game.<br/>
Anyone else looked at the webpage and have any thoughts on this?<br/>
I love the idea of being able to unlock, open, or bash open chests and such.<br/>
That is something I feel was missing from this game. And the private space<br/>
sounds good too.<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>
luv,<br/>
