&gt; I&#39;m back everyone. The last time I was a part of this group, I was<br/>
&gt; driven away due to a misunderstanding. After that, the owner and I<br/>
&gt; have made some-what of a friendship and I decided to give the group<br/>
&gt; another try. It is, after all, the only decent EverQuest group at<br/>
&gt; Yahoo! and I was disappointed that I had to leave in the first<br/>
&gt; place. So, I&#39;m glad to be back. First comes first, what servers do<br/>
&gt; you all play on?<br/>
