<div id="ygrps-yiv-366605386">You are right, I checked it last night. Not no-drop, but Lore. Wow, <br/>
it&#39;s only selling for about 150-200PP on Fennin. I tried to /auction <br/>
last night and no takers. I think I will just do the quest again for <br/>
the EXP, wasn&#39;t hard to do at all with the PoK. I have to take my hat <br/>
off to the folks who did this quest before PoK because they did a lot <br/>
of traveling... <br/>

&gt;   &gt; Ok, I can answer my own question here. I found out from a GM <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   &gt; stein is LORE/NO DROP. I have one in the bank that I bought <br/>
 </span></blockquote>about a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;   i know that it is LORE... but didn&#39;t think of it as the problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   is it really NO DROP, now? that&#39;s pretty new to me... i will<br/>
&gt;   check it the next time... i am not playing EQ very often in<br/>
&gt;   the last weeks... </span></blockquote></div>
