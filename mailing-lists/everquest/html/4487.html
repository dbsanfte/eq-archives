<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Well I&#39;ve been playing my rogue consistently now 
since last Thursday.&nbsp; I&#39;ve gone up 4 levels.&nbsp; I&#39;m almost to level 37 
now.&nbsp; Still in Dawnshroud Peaks.&nbsp; But I guess I&#39;m getting too 
impatient.&nbsp; XP isn&#39;t coming nearly as fast as I&#39;d like.&nbsp; I can pretty 
much solo lightcrawlers and some shrooms now. The tribals I can take if I have 
buffs, but that&#39;s about it.&nbsp; I&#39;m getting really tired of Dawnshroud.&nbsp; 
Anybody have any suggestions on where I can go next that the xp might come a 
little faster?&nbsp; I was told Dreadlands, but I should wait until I&#39;m about 
level 38.&nbsp; A place with some nice plat would be good too as I need to start 
upgrading my weapons and armor.&nbsp; I need a better bow and some + stamina 
gear.&nbsp; Any suggestions on what gear I could get or where I could 
hunt?</font></div>
