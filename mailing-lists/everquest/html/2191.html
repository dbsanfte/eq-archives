<div id="ygrps-yiv-239613924">Nay, Shamans and Necros can both solo effectively all the way to 60. <br/>
<br/>
With the mobs in the Grey and Fungus Grove both being blue at level 60 at<br/>
the zone in, it makes for some easy experience. I&#39;ve seen Druids, Wizards,<br/>
Shadow Knights, Paladins, Rangers, Bards, Enchanters and even Clerics solo<br/>
at 60, some are just more effective than others. With all the new AA skills,<br/>
armor, spells and Flowing Thought items that now all stack on top of each<br/>
other, soloing is not that hard at level 60. Some are more effective than<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
I think Shamans can solo just about as good as any other class. From level 1<br/>
to 60, some classes will do some levels faster than others. As long as you<br/>
have the right gear and spells. No class can get the higher end gear to solo<br/>
at level 60 unless they buy it with plat and MQ some of the armor quests. No<br/>
epic can be obtained unless they group, some epic pieces can be solo&#39;d, but<br/>
no class can get their end epic weapon 100% solo.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to pick 1 class to just solo from 1 to 60, I&#39;d pick either a shaman<br/>
or druid and I&#39;ve played both classes at level 60. The Shaman class would be<br/>
more valuable at level 60 imo, but the Druid would level faster. <br/>

	1-60 is druids. I intend to take my rogue as far as I<br/>
	can solo just to see if I can do it and I solo&#39;d my<br/>
	warrior to 12.<br/>
