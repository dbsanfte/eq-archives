<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040376070">Howdy, I used to be a huge EQ addict, but about a year ago I just <br/>
stopped playing. Since then I&#39;ve lost contact with all my friends <br/>
that made the game fun for me. If somebody could check to see if they <br/>
are still around get if so get them to email me at <br/>
