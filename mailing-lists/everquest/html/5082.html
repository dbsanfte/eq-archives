<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] General rule for posting links <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-71179978">Oh, I don&#39;t mind you adding links to the links section of the groups thingy.<br/>
I just meant that when someone sends an email to the list with a link, I<br/>
would like them to include a description of what the link is for. If it is a<br/>
non-eq link the subject can say &quot;OT&quot; and then something about &quot;my new list&quot;<br/>
or something like that.<br/>
I&#39;m not mad. I&#39;m just insane. :-P<br/>
*time for me to go read my collection of Legion of Super-Heroes again-- <br/>
thunderstorm is keeping me from playing EQ*<br/>
