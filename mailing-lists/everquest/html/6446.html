<div id="ygrps-yiv-572168537">Does anyone else see PLing beyond level 20 as wrong?  I mean, if<br/>
you&#39;re trying to catch up to someone else to be able to group with<br/>
them (and you&#39;ve actually gotten a toon above 20 before), then I could<br/>
see it.  But powerleveling people up to 20+, just because they want to<br/>
be uber and go to better zones for better drops isn&#39;t teaching them<br/>
how to play their character very well, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
I have more fun fighting and scratching my way toward 70, than just<br/>
killing the same mobs over and over until they turn blue, them moving<br/>
to another zone to kill tougher stuff.  To me, it&#39;s the journey and<br/>
learning to play your character properly.  Nothing irks me more than<br/>
to group with someone who is level 60, but has no real clue as to how<br/>
to play their toon.  It steals from everyone in the groups good<br/>
experience to have to &quot;take care of&quot; the newb who was PL&#39;d to 60.<br/>
