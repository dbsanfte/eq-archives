Welcome Aboard :)  What server are you playing on ???  I know on Maelin <br/>
right now they are recruiting in guilds for new players and alot of <br/>
them do not have a level restriction.  That is a great way to meet up <br/>
with friends online and get to know people.  My alt is now in a guild <br/>
that does Idons 2 nights a week and have been able to make some good <br/>
group friends that way.  Hope this helps :) <br/>

&gt; playing Everquest like a few days ago. So I hope that this group would<br/>
&gt; enhance my game playing. One more thing, I wanted to know how I can<br/>
&gt; look for local Everquest groups. I live in Brooksville, FL. So if<br/>
&gt; anyone has any ideas, please let me know. Thanks.<br/>
