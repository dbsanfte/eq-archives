<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107738354">I have found silk to be one of the best ways to earn plat for us youngin&#39;s.<br/>
Spiderling Silk, Spider Silk, Shadeling Silk, and Shade Silk sell for 1-5<br/>
plat each in the bazaar.  You can carry 20 in a stack and they are so light<br/>
you never worry about being encumbered.  Many places have spiders,<br/>
bonecrawlers, widows, etc that drop silk so you should be able to find a<br/>
place to farm that is friendly to you.  I am using a human (level 8) at the<br/>
moment and he has been haning out in the commonlands.  Once the spiderlings<br/>
go green I start on the bigger spiders.  Not only am I making $$ I am<br/>
improving my skills the whole time.  Loot all the spider parts, sell<br/>
everything to local vendors but keep the silk.  When selling to vendors look<br/>
at their stock.  Occasionally I find silk for sale for a gold or two, buy it<br/>
all!  When you have enough silk sell it in the bazaar.  See what others are<br/>
selling it for and price it the same as the lowest priced guy.  Demand is<br/>
high enough I always sell out in under and hour.<br/>
<br/>
With my cleric I use my spells to kill since you can get better at casting<br/>
even if you cast on green creatures.  I have noticed the my melee char does,<br/>
on rare occasions, improve skills on green chars.  This is contrary to what<br/>
I have read in a few places, but it is so rare you might as well say melee<br/>
skills never go up on green.<br/>
<br/>
If your on a server that allows for more then one character, make one char<br/>
and send it to the bazaar right away.  That char will now live in the bazaar<br/>
so it does not need skills or equip.  Gather silk and put in shared bank.<br/>
Switch to bazaar char and sell, drop plat in shared bank and swtitch back to<br/>
main char.  Keeps you from running so much.<br/>
<br/>
Gloomingdeep silk is an exception.  Have not sold any in bazaar, sell to<br/>
vendors.  Don&#39;t buy if you find it.<br/>
