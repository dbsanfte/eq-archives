  <div><br></div><tt>Two days ago I was playing EQ (what else?) when my monitor 
  shut <br>itself off. After much exploration I found that my graphics card had 
  <br>crapped out. I thought more trouble was afoot, when my computer <br>seemed 
  to think it was a 256. After reloading a few drivers, I tested <br>the video 
  card again. No video output.<br><br>I was planning on a new card, anyway. We 
  are limping along on the old <br>video out, and I started the disheartening 
  search for a pci card of <br>some value.<br><br>Imagine my elation when I 
  found a gforce4 in pci format for $116!<br><br>Lacking a free $116 right now, 
  I am still limping. But more than I <br>dared hope for is available.<br><br>On 
  the down side, I learned just how much of an EQ junkie I am. I was <br>so 
  depressed by the malfunction that I got drunk. I don&#39;t usually do <br>that. 
  Drank a half pint of Gilby&#39;s vodka and watched dvd&#39;s for a <br>while. Then 
  went to work on the &#39;puter, got it running again, and <br>started 
  shopping.<br><br>Hope to get the new card very soon. Should have my son buy 
  it, as he <br>plays more than I do. His primary is over ten levels ahead of 
  mine.<br><br>Good hunting, everyone.<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
