reading this message.<br/>
   When you download the patch one file that it shows is _verquest.doc <br/>
but deleteing that file won&#39;t work because it will just appear again.<br/>
<br/>
   Here are some things you could download Directx 8.1 if you don&#39;t <br/>
have it because you need it to play Shawdows of Lurcin, You could <br/>
Email coustomer support, you can scan your computer for errors, or you <br/>
can ask other people for help.<br/>
