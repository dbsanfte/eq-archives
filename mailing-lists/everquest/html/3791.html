  <p>With all due respect, what is so fun about going around&nbsp;for a 
  week&nbsp;building up money for armor that you desperately want when you could 
  do it in a way that isn&#39;t as deadly, would only take you 3-4 days, and would 
  give you more exp in the long run of things, and then the better armor would 
  be something to brag about to other ppl ,and you&#39;d probably get more invites.

    <p>Thank you for posting this. I went to check them out and you know I have 
    to say I was a little dissapointed in the guides. A lot of the information 
    that they contain can be found at almost any EQ related website! It&#39;s 
    basically that I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay for any of these guides, it&#39;s really 
    not worth the money. The only thing I&#39;m truly interested in is making money. 
    Man&nbsp;it sucks trying to get some decent armor when you have no money. 
    I&#39;ve wondered about the &quot;make Plat at any level&quot; guides and&nbsp;I figured 
    that you would still need to group or partner at some point. </p>
    <p>Either way I&#39;m having fun just going along and doing things the old 
    fashioned way. I do suggest going and getting these guides because there 
    were a few things in there that was nice to know about but for any player, 
    especially noobs, I suggest doing it the old fashioned way and go out there 
    and take the lumps and partner with some others. It&#39;s funner and you&#39;ll feel 
    better knowing that you did it on your own. </p>
    <p>I got some good info about Unrest so&nbsp;I think I may go and try it out 
    this week. </p>--
