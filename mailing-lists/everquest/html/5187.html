<div><font face="Arial" size="2">One day while sitting in class ignoring my 
professor&#39;s lecture, I was browsing the web and came across a weblink.&nbsp; It 
was a series of comic strips based on EverQuest that I thought was really well 
done.&nbsp; I had intended on posting the link to this list, but never 
did.&nbsp; Now I&#39;m trying to find the link again but I cant remember how or 
where I found it.&nbsp; So I was hoping that maybe someone here might know what 
I&#39;m talking about.&nbsp; Essentially the comic strip starts out with a female 
wood elf turning in her quest paper to become a druid, but some things happen 
and she ends up being taken under the wing (?) of an Iksar who was a friend of 
her father.&nbsp; The Iksar character is named after the person&#39;s character who 
draws the strip.&nbsp; Hopefully this is enough information that someone might 
recognize it and post the link.&nbsp; </font></div>
