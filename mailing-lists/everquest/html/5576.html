<div id="ygrps-yiv-418699467">Cool!  How do you get that software? How much does it cost?<br/>
I would love to learn how to do stuff like that. I got a download of a Flash program and I tried to make something with it but it kept saying I performed an illegal operation and crashed.<br/>
Yeah, I love the various scenes. They are awesome.<br/>
And the beggar thing was great! My brother came and looked over my shoulder as I was watching it. He loved it too. I had never heard that song before and I really liked it.<br/>
Makes me want to get the software and do something like that for my guild. I need to get more guild pictures...<br/>
Thanks for sharing that!<br/>
luv,<br/>

Hi Su and thanks .<br/>
<br/>
I used Macromedia Flash MX Professional 2004  to create the film the music<br/>
addition was just a simple thing of adding it into one of teh frams  and<br/>
letting  it start where I wanted it to.<br/>
<br/>
As for the pics I can thank my guildmates for most of the pics  I just<br/>
arranged them in a way that I thought would work best for what I had in mind<br/>
as I was picking them out  and I tried to have some of the effects to be<br/>
timed  with various parts of the song itself.  One of my guildmates said<br/>
that they liked the part where my Char is on his Drogmor and raises his epic<br/>
to point  at  what I would like to imagine  was a mob we were getting ready<br/>
to attack. In actuality we were getting set up for a Raid in Plane of Sky<br/>
(air) and I had actually targeted the dwarf in front of me  and used him for<br/>
the point reference hehe.<br/>
<br/>
My actual favorite though out of all of that was the very last frame lol<br/>
where you can replay  teh film lol. that is my illustyrious guild leader lol<br/>
and one of our trade skillers suggested that he dye his armor pink for April<br/>
Foll&#39;s and  someone took teh screenshot of him dancing in his pink outfit<br/>
lol  and as soon as I saw it I knew I wanted that one to be at teh end of<br/>
the film. At the time I planned this I hadn&#39;t thought about even doing a<br/>
replay feature till I was nearly done withteh film and it took me a week to<br/>
figure out how to keep the film form ending completely and going back to the<br/>
start of the actual film and not to the prelaod portion. Byt the time I was<br/>
done with the film I think my brain went LD for a couple of days lol just<br/>
before I posted it for public viewing lol<br/>
<br/>
my next favorite is where i am nekkid in PoK waiting for a rezz and one of<br/>
our wizzies was there with me and in the movie I just had to make fun of the<br/>
beggars  that are so prevalent in the Eq world lol<br/>
