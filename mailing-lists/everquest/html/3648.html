<div id="ygrps-yiv-36878248">First, what server?<br/>
And why would your BF, start a char on a different<br/>
server than your chars?  Hmm guess he doesn&#39;t want you<br/>
to twink him either lol.........<br/>
<br/>
I have a level 20 mage and to be honest with you, you<br/>
dont need much under 25 since pet will work most of<br/>
the baddies<br/>
<br/>
I mean if you can get some mana increasing items, I<br/>
would say do it.....but your power is in your hands<br/>
not your clothes......hahahaha<br/>
<br/>
Always plan on getting enough PP to get spells,<br/>
especially your pets....<br/>
<br/>
Oh and words of advice, playing a mage can stink<br/>
unless you have friends......since travelling to<br/>
neriak to get the summon staff spell STINKS.....<br/>
<br/>
And at 16 your pets can be either made from research<br/>
which needs to be learned no matter what for other<br/>
cool spells and killer pets, or you need to get on<br/>
over to the Ocean of Tears and find some girl up on a<br/>
hill, visit eq.castersrealm.com for that details.<br/>
<br/>
But all in all, the mage is fun for soloing, I<br/>
actually put mine to rest but have started him up<br/>
again since I am now in a guild... I hear getting into<br/>
groups with a mage is tough later on in the game.  But<br/>
they still are second to wizzies for DD spells so what<br/>
the heck.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, you can solo your hearts content with a<br/>
mage so Enjoy and if you play with your RLBF,<br/>
depending on what class he is, he will love your pet<br/>
taking the beating so you can NUKE away.....<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
<br/>
Rob<br/>

&gt; nothing else but cloth<br/>
&gt; and the summoned focus items. Got any suggestions?<br/>
