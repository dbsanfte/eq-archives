<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104324527">I&#39;m glad you brought that up Su, I&#39;m worried that your account was<br/>
hacked or something because your cleric is showing up as level 34 ( I<br/>
think ) and your brothers SK is showing up as level 19 ( I think ) and<br/>
that really freaked me out.  I understand that the guild aplet can<br/>
sometimes be hosed, but that&#39;s never happened to me before.  <br/>
<br/>
Please consider working it out with SOE, the rewards they are offering<br/>
long timers like us for renewing for another year at $99 is actually<br/>
really attractive and I bet you are 6 year vet too.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if there is ANYTHING I can do to help you.<br/>

I may be through with EQ now. I went to login to check my email and<br/>
apparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea why.<br/>
Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with my<br/>
brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not I want<br/>
to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a higher price.<br/>
I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me off that they<br/>
pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an angry letter of<br/>
complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>
ARG. Just ARG!!!<br/>
luv,<br/>
