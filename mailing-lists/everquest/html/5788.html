<div id="ygrps-yiv-655934346">Hi Danielle and welcome to EQ! I hope you will have a good time and <br/>
enjoy the game along with trying to figure out why hubby is addicted! <br/>
LOL Actually I like to think of the &quot;addiction&quot; caused by EQ is one like <br/>
an &quot;on-going vacation&quot; It&#39;s always something new, challenging, the <br/>
possibilities are almost endless. There are so many places to go and <br/>
see, and real people to meet and not just computer created people <br/>
although there are those too, (called NPC&#39;s) that you do need to talk <br/>
to. You can meet others from all over the world from the safety and <br/>
comfort of your house. Plus the growth and development of your character <br/>
  is like watching a child grow. Before you know it, you&#39;ll be addicted!<br/>
<br/>
Happy adventureing!<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m Danielle and I&#39;m quite new with EverQuest. It is my husband <br/>
&gt; indeed who kind of made me interested in the game on the internet as <br/>
&gt; he is very good at it and can play hours (when I say hours I mean <br/>
&gt; LOTS of hours!!!) in a row!! I saw him playing a straight 24 hours <br/>
&gt; recently.... :) So hopefully this group will help me understand the <br/>
&gt; addiction it does create!! :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Danielle<br/>
