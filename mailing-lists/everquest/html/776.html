<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078061804">I agree that the list has died, but anyways I got a question for all you<br/>
enchanters out there...<br/>
I am halfway into 28, would have hit 29 but I am cautious and I like to play<br/>
around (all guards except highpass hate my 24 illusions... hehe).... How<br/>
often do people ask you for clarity? and how hard would it be to get a group<br/>
after achieving 29? and last.... do you recommend going /anon or /role?<br/>
Thanks in advance...<br/>
