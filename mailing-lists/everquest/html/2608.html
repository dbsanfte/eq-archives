<div id="ygrps-yiv-199795777">If you have played for a week and have a level 30+<br/>
character, you are better than anyone on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 chars, been playing 4 months and they are at<br/>
16, 14 10, and 10.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t power level nor do I twink.  I actually enjoy<br/>
the lower levels I just wish I could get good items at<br/>
those levels.  I can&#39;t seem to find good armor or<br/>
weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck but I don&#39;t think you need it.....  ;)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been playing EQ since September of 2000 or so.<br/>
&gt; I obviously enjoy<br/>
&gt; playing. :-) I&#39;m not sure exactly what kind of<br/>
&gt; advice you&#39;re asking for<br/>
&gt; here. Anything specific you need to know about?<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt; Hi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. I<br/>
&gt; am not a very good EQ<br/>
&gt; player. I would consider myself ultra competent in<br/>
&gt; group battles, but in<br/>
&gt; other aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I<br/>
&gt; have never gotten a<br/>
&gt; character past level 40. My first character was an<br/>
&gt; Erudite Enchanter by the<br/>
&gt; name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to<br/>
&gt; level 40 after two years or<br/>
&gt; so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which was my<br/>
&gt; friends character but I<br/>
&gt; own it. I just started playing again after giving up<br/>
&gt; on the game and playing<br/>
&gt; DAOC. Eventually I gave up all MMORPGS deciding they<br/>
&gt; were a waste of time.<br/>
&gt; About a week ago, I decided to give EQ another<br/>
&gt; chance and have decided that<br/>
&gt; it has improved a great deal. I am now playing a<br/>
&gt; Human Ranger who is level<br/>
&gt; 30. I really like the character. His buffs and<br/>
&gt; damage spells are great. I<br/>
&gt; guess I could use some help on how to be a good EQ<br/>
&gt; player. I have been<br/>
&gt; playing for about two years and I feel like I know<br/>
&gt; absolutely nothing about<br/>
&gt; the game. I have never belonged to a good guild or<br/>
&gt; anything. I play on the<br/>
&gt; Xegony server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
