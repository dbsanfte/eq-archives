<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047169790">As a newbie it is best to just get out there and hunt. Sell what you <br/>
can and do buy your spells as money and level allow. The newbie <br/>
period is one of learning. <br/>
<br/>
As a druid you will want to either build your tailoring and smithing <br/>
skills or get to know someone who does these things. You can only <br/>
wear leather armor, and making it is a good way to go. I am a level <br/>
29 halfling druid (primary character) and I am currently making <br/>
reinforced armor for myself and others. To do so I had to learn <br/>
tailoring, smithing, and brewing. To make my special magic halfling <br/>
leather armor I will need to advance these skills farther. Since I <br/>
enjoy the challenge of skills as much as leveling, this is fun for me.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your newbie time. This time will help you establish your style <br/>
of play, learn to navigate and hunt, learn to play with others, and <br/>
establish you gaming goals.<br/>
<br/>
Get to know the gaming sites. Start with those which have been <br/>
suggested. Explore others.<br/>
<br/>
I printed out the zone connection maps and zone maps and keep the <br/>
information handy when I play. I now know many zones well enough that <br/>
I don&#39;t need the maps, but others have questions I can answer if I <br/>
have the map handy. For exploring new zones the maps and other <br/>
information makes learning easier.<br/>
<br/>
At times other players will be helpful. Sometimes they are busy with <br/>
quests or personal goals and haven&#39;t time to help. Once in a while a <br/>
mature player will look for newbies to help, and that is great. Other <br/>
times you will be very much on your own.<br/>
<br/>
Good Hunting to you.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have just bought the Everquest trilogy box and have played a few <br/>
&gt; times.  I have found a few helpful people out there but it seems <br/>
most <br/>
&gt; are playing solo. Is this normal?  They suggest grouping so that is <br/>
&gt; my first question.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Next, I am having trouble getting money to get decent weapons.<br/>
&gt; I am a level 3 Druid and only have a club.  One guy gave me some <br/>
&gt; money but it wasn&#39;t much.  He suggested buying more spells, but I <br/>
&gt; really would like a good weapon.  Dealing 1-3 points of damage just <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t cutting it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lastly for now, should I be starting with a fighter type until I <br/>
&gt; really get use the the game and interface.  I really love wizards <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; those type of characters but understand if playing a warrior makes <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; easier.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I always get confused on where I am going. I think I venture too <br/>
far <br/>
&gt; out of the city area.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you for letting the newbie post?  ;)<br/>
