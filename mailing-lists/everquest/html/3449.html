Pets cant tank shit if you have any other melee in group, the cant hold aggro 
besides the fact that pathing can really screw things up.</font></span></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anybody play the beastlord class? I&#39;ve played one 
  to level 13 and it is ok. The beastlord himself is about as good of a fighter 
  as a bard except they can only wear leather armor. His pet is a good tank 
  though with a neat taunt proc and the beastlord has cleric level heals for the 
  pet. He also gets shaman spells too. It&#39;s a lot like a magician except with 
  more of an emphasis on healing and buffs. I don&#39;t see why the beastlord pet 
  couldn&#39;t be a main tank in a group. I kind of wish they got a few extra spells 
  though most of their best spells you don&#39;t get until level 59 or 60. I wish 
  there were weak lower level versions of some of their key spells like maybe a 
  spell like the enchanter&#39;s augmentation spell that increases attack speed %15 
  or something.</font></div><br><br><tt>Visit
