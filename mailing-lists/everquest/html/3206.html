<div id="ygrps-yiv-939449444">My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings toward game <br/>
death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s attitudes <br/>
toward game death?<br/>
<br/>
I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on <br/>
since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in <br/>
awkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t just <br/>
call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor do  <br/>
have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big <br/>
nasty.<br/>
<br/>
My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the <br/>
place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server. He <br/>
is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and tactics <br/>
and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the <br/>
Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>
<br/>
I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but enjoy <br/>
my independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career as <br/>
possible. <br/>
