<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750829274">heres the info i have.  In kithicore forest is the rangers/druid quest.  I know the rangers is ivy etched, and the druid im guessing.<br/>
The temple of solosek ro, is through lava storm.  Inside there is the three spellcasters and bards<br/>
i know the enchanters have wand, mask, and gloves.   The magician has robes and some other stuff.  OTHER! equipment is available there.  As well as a few clerical items.  If anyone wants to go through and start naming who gives what and how.  I have taken screen shots of what the enchanter person has said.  But other then what he said thats it.  <br/>
