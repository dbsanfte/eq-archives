<div id="ygrps-yiv-868239615">I have to agree the new graphics looks great.  I had bought the game<br/>
when it first came out and the graphics were good for three years ago but<br/>
the new ones the have for SoL are cool.  I also upgraded to a new system<br/>
when the game came out.  My video drivers may not be WQHL (a direct x item)<br/>
but the graphics are still great and crisp.  Nvidia hasn&#39;t come up with new<br/>
drivers since DEc 3 and I have those.  Anyway the new expansion should be a<br/>
great success</div>
