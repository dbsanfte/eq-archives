<div id="ygrps-yiv-44130096">I also have a Voodoo3 3000, never had any problems with it.  My<br/>
understanding is that Voodoo cards actually work better on EQ than some<br/>
other cards with higher specs because of Voodoo&#39;s superior support for<br/>
Glide which helps with the types of graphics used in EQ.<br/>
