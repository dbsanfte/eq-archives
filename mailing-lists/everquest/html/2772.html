 </span></blockquote>You can, but prepare for some major frustration. Even<br/>
late at night on Karana it&#39;s not uncommon to find 2-3<br/>
people hunting Mammoths, and the ONLY thing that&#39;s not<br/>
green or very red in that level range is Icewind and<br/>
his Orcs. (a group of about five orcs that all aggro<br/>
at once unless you harmony pull them)<br/>
<br/>
On the druid side of it though, there&#39;s an added<br/>
reason to go, the Tainted and Corrupted Wooly Mammoths<br/>
spawn there, one of the nine Corrupted mobs for the<br/>
Druid epic quest. :)<br/>
