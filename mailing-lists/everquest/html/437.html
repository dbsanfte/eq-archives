<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952566358">Bouncer Hurd (ogre) and one of his other bouncer buds (ogre) patrol around<br/>
the outside and outskirts of the Cazic Thule dungeon in Feerott.  (Hurd is<br/>
not actually inside the dungeon itself)  He quite frequently, along with his<br/>
bud, comes INTO the corridor safe zone area where you zone into Cazic itself<br/>
and starts killing everyone who is trying to heal who zoned out of Cazic<br/>
from the notorious trains.<br/>
<br/>
Hurd is a VERY nasty, VERY hard and fast hitting ogre whom I have only seen<br/>
killed by like a 35+ mob.  I did see a 42 level paladin in full plate armor<br/>
fully buffed with a ghoulbane kill him solo, but that was only because I was<br/>
standing behind him and putting greater heals on him until I ran out of<br/>
mana, and then two others players jumped in at the end to help finish him<br/>
off.  And if Hurd&#39;s bud is with him, you are in double trouble.  I was<br/>
sitting and medding at the zone when they both showed up and literally in<br/>
less than 2 seconds, stunned me, double teamed me and took out about 3/4 of<br/>
my hps (I am level 39).  If I had not been at full health and been 2 inches<br/>
from the zone I would&#39;ve died.  A friend of mine died to Hurd and his<br/>
bouncer bud 4 times in about 3 minutes....he was bound in the corridor right<br/>
outside the cazic zone, so each time Hurd killed him and he reappeared, Hurd<br/>
and his friend killed him again.  He was NOT a happy shaman that nite.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, Hurd is the one with the crude stein, but not always.  It&#39;s a rare<br/>
spawn from what I am told.  I was lucky enough to get one from that paladin<br/>
I kept healed and buffed so he could solo Hurd.<br/>

&gt;Can anyone verify if the Crude Stein is found in Cazic Thule on Bouncer<br/>
&gt;Hurd? If so, where can Bouncer Hurd be found? Also, how rare is he of a<br/>
&gt;spawn (and for that matter, how rare is the stein?) I really need this item<br/>
&gt;to help lower costs of supplies for my smithing skill.<br/>
