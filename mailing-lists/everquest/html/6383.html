<b>Subject:</b> What to buy to get started? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387851717">Lots of products to choose from.  What products does a newb that has <br/>
never played Everquest before purchase?  i.e.  How do I get online <br/>
with this game and do I want it or the newest EV II.  (Bored with UO <br/>
for sure.)<br/>
Thx in advance.  Linda M</div>
