<div id="ygrps-yiv-836502037">It&#39;s it seems to me that this is the case.  I have no empirical evidence one way or the other, but I think it&#39;s accurate.  When I get wacked by a sand giant, I don&#39;t seem to loose as much as if a<br/>

&gt; I saw someone write somewhere that the exp you loose depends on the monster that kills you.  Such as if you die from a monster that is many levels below you, you loose more exp.  Is this true?<br/>
