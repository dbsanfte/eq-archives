<div id="ygrps-yiv-194282325">It is not totally realistic that someone can look at all of your equipment.<br/>
As a wizard, how do people &quot;see&quot; what kind of belt and pants I am wearing?<br/>
They have to peek UNDER my robe.  Now if someone came up to you in real life<br/>
and lifted up YOUR robe to what was underneath... :)<br/>
<br/>
Usually if I wish to inspect someone I ask.  I find that way to be the<br/>
polite way.  No one ever says no.<br/>
<br/>
May all of you level tomorrow, twice!,<br/>
