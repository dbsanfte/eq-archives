<br/>
basically, it is pretty easy:<br/>
1) get &quot;Ring of Ancients&quot; off a &quot;Ancient Cyclops&quot;<br/>
2) get &quot;Shadowed Rapier&quot; (NO DROP) off &quot;Shadow Man&quot;<br/>
3) find &quot;Hasten&quot;, give above items plus &quot;3250gp&quot;<br/>
<br/>
about (1): the AC can be found in South Ro or Ocean<br/>
of Tears.<br/>
<br/>
in SR it is a &quot;random&quot; spawn. there is no &quot;real<br/>
camp&quot;: it can spawn in all the sandy area of SR.<br/>
Kill Stealing is pretty common there, and GMs<br/>
won&#39;t be of much assistance there. i was able to<br/>
get a ring after 5 minutes or wait for several<br/>
hours, days. that&#39;s what i know after i killed<br/>
the AC over 10 times there. (no, i didn&#39;t sold the<br/>
MQ, i have enough ALTs and friends to serve :-)<br/>
<br/>
in OOT you really can camp the AC: random spawn<br/>
at a static spawn point. people are very serious<br/>
about not KSing there. the main problems are<br/>
(a) getting the camp, (b) getting ultra bored<br/>
having the camp. location is on the isle with<br/>
the spell merchant. the AC has a pirate and a<br/>
troll on the same spawn cycle. it took me about<br/>
8 hours to get an AC ring there.<br/>
<br/>
the AC in OOT is a bit tougher as its cousin<br/>
in SR: 40+-1 compared to 36+-1. but i am not<br/>
really sure about the levels. when i first<br/>
successfully hit the AC, bilt was 46.<br/>
<br/>
step (2): i like to hunt shadow men in west<br/>
commons. but any place is good. the stupid<br/>
thing about shadow men drop(ping)s: almost<br/>
all of them are NO RENT. also it isn&#39;t easy<br/>
to spot them. it is possible to &quot;see&quot; if a<br/>
shadow men wields a shadow rapier. drop rate<br/>
is strange: it took about 3 hours to get one<br/>
once... but must of the time, you can get<br/>
one in 30mins to 1 hour.<br/>
<br/>
last part (3): ok, now you have to give Hasten<br/>
(gnome, very fast, imho faster than jboots)<br/>
3250gp. i also tried it with 325pp and it<br/>
worked for me, but i also have gold on another<br/>
char if it should fail. when you have the<br/>
AC ring, you really don&#39;t care about the money<br/>
anymore, you just don&#39;t want to loose the<br/>
ring!<br/>
<br/>
the &quot;biggest&quot; problem is to find Hasten:<br/>
 - he is on a cycle with a drake and a lvl 60<br/>
   brother (brother is needed by monk epic)<br/>
 - their &quot;normal&quot; lifetime is four hours<br/>
 - their respawn time is 28 minutes<br/>
 - the three have a very long route they will<br/>
   follow<br/>
 - Hasten runs very fast<br/>
 - Hasten is small (gnome)<br/>
<br/>
if you don&#39;t know the route of those three, you<br/>
will need a tracker. many will help you there<br/>
(many druids are there farming the poor HGs).<br/>
if Hasten is up, someone has to stop him by<br/>
hailing him... and keep hailing him, until the<br/>
person doing the quest gets there. hand in the<br/>
items, with the person to get the jboots being<br/>
the last one to hit OK in the trade window.<br/>
<br/>
if Hasten isn&#39;t up, check if the brother is up.<br/>
you only have a few choices then:<br/>
 - kill him... not so easy for most chars<br/>
 - wait for him to despawn<br/>
<br/>
if the drake is up, kill it (i don&#39;t know the<br/>
level, but it is very low), wait for 28 minutes<br/>
and check the spawns again.<br/>
<br/>
after on of the three is killed, it is randomed<br/>
which one will spawn after 28 minutes. the chances<br/>
are drake - hasten - brother, eg a drake will<br/>
respawn more often than hasten.<br/>
<br/>
one more word about it: i won&#39;t go into more detail!<br/>
i know how _i_ will do it and everyone has to find<br/>
her/his own way doing the quest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
good luck<br/>
