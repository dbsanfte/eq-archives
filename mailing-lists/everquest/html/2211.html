<div id="ygrps-yiv-494427207">A better an more interesting question, more &quot;correct&quot; answers too, is what 2<br/>
classes make the best DUO team.  I wont say what is best because I guess it<br/>
might boil down to two players that play well together and not depend on<br/>
their class too much (par from two straight melee).  <br/>
<br/>
My favorite?  Ranger + Enchanter.  Outdoor zones fights go something like<br/>
this enchanter tashs with beserker up or whatever dmg absorb spell they have<br/>
for that lvl.  As enchanter is casting tash he runs at the mob while the<br/>
ranger starts to cast snare enchanter will get hit and his pet will start to<br/>
attack.  By this time the ranger should have hit the mob and taken agro from<br/>
the pet (The pet agro patch actually helped enchanter pets a ton.  They<br/>
taunted like nobody&#39;s business and died fairly quick).  Enchanter fears and<br/>
uses his mana wisely nuking when it wont hurt down time more than help by  a<br/>
faster kill.  Ranger shouldnt cast any spells but snare and save the rest of<br/>
his mana for heals depending on what you are fighting a few seconds of non<br/>
feared mob might take a bub or two.  <br/>
<br/>
Using this tactic an Enchanter Ranger combo can make a great team for<br/>
outdoor mobs.  Yes, you can substitue the ranger class for any class that<br/>
can snare but there are a few reasons, in my opinion, why rangers make the<br/>
best choice.<br/>
<br/>
Necro, he doesnt need an enchanter, he will get faster exp solo, and the<br/>
only thing the enchanter will bring to the group is haste (necro has this<br/>
for thier pet, enchanters haste is better at some lvl&#39;s but really not a<br/>
good enough reason to group with you).  Clarity?  Necro lich type spells are<br/>
better at every lvl.<br/>
<br/>
Shadow Knight, his darkness spell doesnt seem to last very long and unless<br/>
he has some really good weapons isnt going to do as much dmg as a ranger.<br/>
<br/>
Druid, too mana dependant over a period of time the ranger will be able to<br/>
do better for you as the druid will start to go oom with constant fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Bard, maybe a nice second choice never duo&#39;d with one much.  Maybe first,<br/>
never tried it.<br/>
<br/>
I have also done this with a warrior that has a snare whip but can make for<br/>
a nasty fight while waiting on whip to proc.<br/>
<br/>
Just me rambling at work.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am just wondering your thoughts on which class<br/>
&gt; makes for the best soloing.. all the way from 1-60..<br/>
&gt; -emily<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This question comes up way way too often, i&#39;ve seen it<br/>
argued about 20 seperate times on message boards,<br/>
here&#39;s how it usually plays out. The Necros and Druids<br/>
immediately leap up and shout &quot;We&#39;re best!&quot; and<br/>
frankly, they are. Necros and Druids solo better than<br/>
any other class in EQ. Which is better? It&#39;s largely a<br/>
matter of personal preferance and where you&#39;re<br/>
soloing. Then everyone else crowds in on the thread<br/>
arguing the merits of their pet class. (as in<br/>
&quot;favorite class&quot;, not Mages ;) Technically really any<br/>
class can solo, it just involves unmanagable amounts<br/>
of downtime, picking less than profitable mobs, and<br/>
unacceptable amounts of risk... unless you&#39;re a Druid<br/>
or Necro. :)<br/>
<br/>
Just an afterthought, had to reply to the post<br/>
questioning Mage&#39;s dominance as &quot;the pet class&quot;, take<br/>
a look at the message boards on eqvault.ign.com<br/>
there&#39;s a large thread comparing the Mage Epic pet to<br/>
the highest level Beastlord pet.<br/>
