<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850110732">A monk also wears leather armor. And a monk tanks pretty good. Aside from<br/>
that the beastlord get a defensive discipline like the warrior. A beastlord<br/>
outtanks most rangers for example.<br/>

How could a beastlord tank well wearing leather armor? I don&#39;t think they<br/>
have that many hitpoints either and only get duel wield. Seems like a good<br/>
class to solo or partner with though if you aren&#39;t into raiding. You<br/>
basically get either two tanks or a tank and a healer depending on how you<br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
I heard they get a couple of group spells, one increases mana and life regen<br/>
and the other increases stats and resistances.<br/>

  The beastlord is sadly untuned yet. As for pet beeing the tank in a group,<br/>
hmm nope. Pets cant tank shit if you have any other melee in group, the cant<br/>
hold aggro besides the fact that pathing can really screw things up.<br/>
   <br/>
  The beastlord himself tanks pretty good and the petheals are excellent.<br/>
But the class brings very little to the raiding world and very few play them </span></blockquote></div>
