<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779381976">The dragon in DL is nasty. My group and I were minding our own business and<br/>
she walked up and wiped us out in 3 seconds. I didn&#39;t even see her. I just<br/>
saw the text saying she was attacking and then saw LOADING PLEASE WAIT....<br/>
luv,<br/>

That is something I have wondered about myself, a good place to hunt in the<br/>
40&#39;s. I am in the Dreadlands at 42 and I like it alright because there are<br/>
people there going on dragon raids and one of my goals is to go on a dragon<br/>
raid someday.<br/>

  Hail all and well met.  I have been playing EQ since<br/>
  about Nov of last year and have become adicted to it<br/>
  just like everyone else.  I have also been a member of<br/>
  this group for awhile but never posted.  Have enjoyed<br/>
  alot of the info that has been put out there.  So I<br/>
  figured it was time for me to come out of the shadows<br/>
  and let my voice be heard.  I been play on Brell,<br/>
  haven&#39;t tried any other servers as of yet.  Have alot<br/>
  of friend on Brell in RL so tis why I stayed on there<br/>
  for this long.  However I do have alittle bit of a<br/>
  question that I want to put out there.  I play a 36<br/>
  Drunken Chanter of Greenhall, am alittle tired of the<br/>
  Kunark area and looking for some new places to hunt.<br/>
  EIther in groups or solo makes me no matter.  But I<br/>
  would like to find a place that i can do both.  And<br/>
  yes this chanter still solos alot.  Although my guild<br/>
  leader doesn&#39;t like it, and she has even taken away my<br/>
  staff so that I couldn&#39;t be a chanter tank anymore.<br/>
  hehe  What she doesn&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt me.  hehe<br/>
  Anyway, did alot of time in LOIO and FM and OT<br/>
  already.  To break it up I even went to SK and soloed<br/>
  the gnolls at the spires.  But now that I am 36 SK<br/>
  just won&#39;t do it much for now.  I do have a score to<br/>
  settle with some giants in the Karanas though.  SO I<br/>
  will be back.  But if anyone could shed alittle light<br/>
  on some good places to group or solo til into the 40s,<br/>
  with good xp.  Not saying I want to lvl every night in<br/>
  one setting, those places would tend to be full of<br/>
  death also.  Just looking for some nice and calm pace,<br/>
  but have alittle on the edge feel to it.  I get enough<br/>
  of that on raids.  And yes I do go on bigger guild<br/>
  raids then my lvl should let me, but then again I have<br/>
  the safety of my guild and some of our allies there.<br/>
  So if anyone is on Brell and wants to give me a shout<br/>
  out feel free.<br/>
<br/>
