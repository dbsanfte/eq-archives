<b>Subject:</b> WinXP and Sound Blaster (live) music (midi) problems. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-353401944">First I hope this group is for the PC version of Everquest. I quit <br/>
about a year and a half ago when I upgraded to Windows XP. I have a <br/>
Sound Blaster Live (value) card. I had the Shadows of Luclin <br/>
expansion.<br/>
<br/>
The sound effects and ambient sounds were good, but the music was <br/>
horribly distorted. I did the usual card driver updates with XP and <br/>
posted to the Vault and other fan sites. Others with XP and this <br/>
sound card had the same problem. EQ support emailed me back a <br/>
response that they were aware and were working on the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Before I consider coming back, I was wondering if anyone had similar <br/>
problems and were they solved with the current, new expansion I <br/>
believe is called &quot;Planes of Power&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hate to invest in the expansion to discover I still can&#39;t have <br/>
the music specific to areas within the zones. Any feedback would be <br/>
appreciated.</div>
