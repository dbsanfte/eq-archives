<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058937893">Recently, a few friends and I killed the captain in WW for the scout quest<br/>
with only 5 people me 58 warrior, 60 rogue, 2 60 clerics and 59 druid. When<br/>
the scout pops on my server, the quest is usually done within 15 minutes or<br/>
so. No time to wait for more, just go for it.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t know of this quest, it is really a great quest, and is fairly<br/>
easy. You first need to get a tool key from the quest giver in Skyshrine,<br/>
Commander Leuz. Then you head out to WW and track to see if Charisa is up.<br/>
Charisa is on a 12 hour spawn cycle. Handing her the tool kit spawns 8<br/>
giants on the shore line with 1 Kromzek Captain. I know this giant can be<br/>
level 58 or 59. <br/>
<br/>
When I fought him this time, Kromzek Captain was level 58. He has a very,<br/>
very high Magic resistance. I know some fire base spells will land after you<br/>
lower his fire base resistance. Our 59 druid pulls him with harmony. We<br/>
don&#39;t pull it to the zone because the fact of a possible KS and we knew it<br/>
would be a long fight with our small group. I think Kromzek Captain has 32k<br/>
hitpoints and hits for 250 and enrages. The 2 clerics in the group knew<br/>
they&#39;d have to time every complete heal to perfection if we were going to<br/>
win. As the fight went on we became worried about my defense discipline,<br/>
which lasts for 3 minutes. The discipline fell when the Kromzek Captain was<br/>
at ~ 30 % health. We ended up killing Kromzek Captain, but both clerics were<br/>
oom and were using low mana heals just to keep me alive. I know we would<br/>
have failed if I would not have had the full line of buffs I had from the<br/>
previous day in ToV. I still had speed buff VoG, shaman buffs AGI, STA,<br/>
Aucman, Focus,  Pallys Divine STR.  With my Ring and the druid damage shield<br/>
I had a 40 point DS which helped too over the 4 Â½ minute fight. <br/>
<br/>
Going into this fight, I really did not give us a chance having killed him<br/>
several times in the past with as much as 14 people. The fewest I&#39;ve done it<br/>
in the past has been 8 people and I remembering that to be a difficult<br/>
battle.<br/>
<br/>
Not a real type of a &quot;brave&quot; story, but one of odds was not in our favor in<br/>
my mind. If you are not aware of this quest and are level 50+ and can get a<br/>
group or 2 of level 55, you should check out this quest. The rewards are<br/>
good for all. Whoever wins can pick any of the following items:<br/>
<br/>
1)	Robe of Benevolence, 17 AC, -8 DEX, 15 CHA, 10 INT, -8 AGI, 25 HP,<br/>
80 MANA<br/>
2)	Bracer of Benevolence 17 AC, 8 STR, 8 STA, 30 HP, 5 FIRE, 12 COLD,<br/>
12 MAGIC<br/>
3)	Talisman of Benevolence 7 AC, 15 WIS, 38 HP, 55 MANA, 12 COLD, 12<br/>
MAGIC <br/>
<br/>
The Talisman is really a great item, it fits into the range slot which makes<br/>
this ideal for the druids, clerics and shaman. The bracers are not lore, so<br/>
you can have 2 of them. The AC on the bracer is lower than my ToV bracers,<br/>
but these bracers are great for dragons/raids with the resists and AC combo.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope I did not bore anyone!<br/>

	Hmmm, I tend to be very cautious because I hate CRs so I don&#39;t<br/>
know....  Maybe the stupidest thing I do often is running through Kithicor<br/>
at any time of the night.  I just get a sow and run up on the side of the<br/>
hill as fast as I can and never look back.  So far, I&#39;ve been lucky and I&#39;ve<br/>
been doing this since my mid teen levels.  Have a friend who says I&#39;m crazy<br/>
and I should wait until day. <br/>

		Hi, <br/>
		Its been pretty quiet here lately so i&#39;ll see if i can get a<br/>
thread going! <br/>
		<br/>
		Ok whats the bravest (or most stupid) thing that you have<br/>
done? <br/>
		<br/>
		I&#39;ll start then: <br/>
		<br/>
		This will probably sound a bit lame to you veterans,  but as<br/>
a newbi to EQ this was pretty scary (not to mention stupid!) <br/>
		<br/>
		I got bored soloing round Qeynos hills with my lv6 Bard, my<br/>
level 7 ranger has far more fun grouping round Greater Fay and CB so.....(in<br/>
best forest gump voice) &quot;i just started running&quot; and tried to run (and boat)<br/>
to kelethin. <br/>
		<br/>
		Being a bard i can run pretty fast so the plains of karana<br/>
were easy.  The gorge that leads to highpass was a lot scarier, running<br/>
round those narrow ledges with a small train of griffon things behind!<br/>
(oops, still bound in Qeynos!!!).  Highpass hold was just as bad - i must<br/>
have run back out of the zone 8 or 9 times with a load of gnolls behind -<br/>
anyway luckily a friendly Halfling guided me through - he was lv9 and we<br/>
still only just made it! <br/>
		<br/>
		Anyway my guide was going to Rivervale....and i have to be<br/>
in work in the morning so i followed him there and finally got a bind before<br/>
i camped. <br/>
		<br/>
		tommorow......On to Freeport! <br/>
		<br/>
		Ok so its not exactly soloing dragons on Velious - but it<br/>
was the most nerve wracking thing ive done so far  - and there is still a<br/>
long way to go to Kelethin! <br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Ok your turn!! <br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Cheers <br/>
