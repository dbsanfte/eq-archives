<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503799022">These are just the people to receive special gifts. Those otherwise <br/>
nice items with negative modifiers. I just overlook or destroy most <br/>
of those, but I may just save one for a special gift.<br/>

&gt; Truly excellent stuff, Su. Thank you for sharing the link.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The sad thing is, you can just sit in GFay and watch the /ooc <br/>
and /shout<br/>
&gt; channel and see a lot of the stuff that Lowtax describes humorously <br/>
in his<br/>
&gt; &quot;newbie guide&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Example from my own experience on Tarew Marr server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other night I was playing my level 13 scratch (totally non-<br/>
twinked) Wood<br/>
&gt; Elf Ranger. A level 1 HE enchanter started spamming GFay for 5pp to <br/>
buy her<br/>
&gt; level 1 spells. Another person and I finally replied back in /ooc <br/>
that you<br/>
&gt; could buy just about all the useful level 1 spells for a platinum <br/>
or so. She<br/>
&gt; then changed her spam to asking for 2pp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Someone else jumped in and chided us for &quot;being harsh&quot; so I decided <br/>
to give<br/>
&gt; the beggar 2pp just to see what happened. I tracked her down near <br/>
Felwithe,<br/>
&gt; hailed her, and gave her 2pp. The VERY next thing she says to me <br/>
is &quot;you got<br/>
&gt; any caster stuff?&quot; Not &quot;Thank You&quot;, not even &quot;ty&quot; or &quot;thx&quot;, <br/>
just &quot;you got<br/>
&gt; any caster stuff&quot;. I just said &quot;No, I am a Ranger, sorry&quot; and <br/>
turned and<br/>
&gt; left.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A few minutes later this same person was back spamming the zone for <br/>
tiny<br/>
&gt; daggers (ingredient to cast pet) because she &quot;looked everywhere in <br/>
Felwithe&quot;<br/>
&gt; and &quot;couldn&#39;t find them anywhere&quot;. I have played a HE enchanter, so <br/>
I KNOW<br/>
&gt; you can buy them for 1sp each from one of the 4 merchants in the <br/>
room where<br/>
&gt; the Enchanter Guildmaster is, so I repeated that information <br/>
in /ooc. She<br/>
&gt; then asks for money to buy them because she didn&#39;t have any. I told <br/>
her in<br/>
&gt; /ooc &quot;An enchanter can get 1 sp for a wasp wing, and that happens <br/>
to be how<br/>
&gt; much a tiny dagger costs. Start killing stuff and stop begging.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I finally deleted my Enchanter at level 10 (I had also played <br/>
him<br/>
&gt; without any help from my higher level characters) he had nearly all <br/>
his<br/>
&gt; level 1, 4, and 8 spells, full (some looted, some bought) cloth <br/>
armor, as<br/>
&gt; well as 50pp in the bank, from just killing and looting everything <br/>
he was<br/>
&gt; able to, and selling it to merchants, so I know it can be done. <br/>
Sure, he did<br/>
&gt; a lot of corpse runs (this was before the patch that eliminated <br/>
corpse runs<br/>
&gt; under level 10), but 1sp per wasp wing, 4sp per royal jelly, 3gp <br/>
per wasp<br/>
&gt; poison sac, 1pp per cracked staff, etc.at the merchants adds up <br/>
fairly<br/>
&gt; quickly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess maybe I was a litte harsh to that newbie chanter, yes, but <br/>
I have<br/>
&gt; used my Druid&#39;s bank account to equip numerous new druids and <br/>
rangers in<br/>
&gt; that zone with full leather armor, a half-way decent newbie weapon, <br/>
and a<br/>
&gt; little buffing (skin like diamond, sow, strength of stone, thorns, <br/>
regen),<br/>
&gt; but not because they begged. I did it because they seemed to be <br/>
players that<br/>
&gt; wanted to have fun and to play the game right, but needed a little <br/>
boost,<br/>
&gt; and I enjoy helping people. I don&#39;t enjoy beggars, though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone else have thoughts to share on players who spam the newbie <br/>
zones<br/>
&gt; asking to be given free money or items? I would be interested to <br/>
see how the<br/>
&gt; others on this mailing list feel about the subject.<br/>
