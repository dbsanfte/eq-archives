<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes, I remember those days.&nbsp; Particularly over one Halloween when werewolves roamed West Commons.&nbsp; I also remember a large snake that came out of the water in North Ro Desert. The quest was to kill the undead that walked the night.&nbsp; They would drop some sort of loot - mushrooms I think it was - and you handed these mushrooms to a priest that stood on the shore.&nbsp; when the priest had collected enough mushrooms he would call forth a giant snake that would come up out of the water.&nbsp; The snake took up the majority of the zone and required many many people to kill.&nbsp; I have no idea what the treasures were this snake was guarding for I never saw them with my own eyes, but I did manage to get in some good wacks to its scaly hide.&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I also remember when the region known as Jagged Pine was first discovered, the Qeynos militia had dilligently lined up outside the entrance to Surefall Glade to fiend off any gnoll lurkers who got too close.&nbsp; It was quite a spectacle to behold except that it caused for encumbering movement and seriously slowed down your transit between zones.&nbsp; Whether or not the gnoll trouble subsided or if the GMs realized the trouble the guards were causing on weary travelers, I don&#39;t know, but the militia has since disappeared.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">But all in all, many a wondrous and strange thing has happened since I have been roaming the lands of Norrath.&nbsp; I wonder whatever happened to those days?</font></div>

<div><br></div><tt>Since we are in a story telling mood, and to get some things jump <br>started, I though I&#39;d ask this.&nbsp; Do you remember your first GM <br>event?&nbsp; Or even the most memorable.&nbsp; <br><br>Now I know some of you are asking what are those!&nbsp; Back in the olden <br>days of Everquest, before the new planes were revealed, before the <br>Nexus opened and the moon Luclin moved closer to us, before the great <br>ice sheet that is Velious was found there were mythical beings that <br>walked the land called GM&#39;s.&nbsp; On certain occasions they would come <br>down to the lands of Norrath and alter them.&nbsp; Sometimes they played <br>tricks, or reset a zone to their own liking.&nbsp; Some of you may have <br>experienced this over Christmas, or during Halloween.<br><br>When Tuldayen was a young and very inexperienced Ranger roaming the <br>hills around Qeynos he was involved in such an event.&nbsp; He awoke one <br>morning to find himself in the quiet of Surefall
 Glade.&nbsp; He took up <br>his trusty Hickory Bow and sheathed his now only tarnished long sword <br>and ventured out into the still unfamiliar hills.&nbsp; But when he <br>entered the tunnel he was met by several of the evil undead.&nbsp; He was <br>lucky enough to jump back into the protection of the glade and <br>avoided death.&nbsp; He thought to himself &quot;where are those guards&quot; and <br>ventured out again.<br><br>He was amazed by what he found.&nbsp; The sky was a deep red, blood red.&nbsp; <br>The entire land was filled with all manner of Skeletons.&nbsp; Many were <br>familiar to him, but many more were not and some were 30 feet tall!&nbsp; <br>It was as if the ancient battlefields of Norrath had spilled their <br>dead on the land.&nbsp; Then he heard the wails of Varsoon the undying and <br>saw great magicks near the ruins.&nbsp; He ran for his life toward the <br>City of Qeynos.&nbsp; When he looked back there were a dozen of the evil <br>creatures behind him.&nbsp; He made
 it to the city and found many like <br>him.&nbsp; Parties were formed and we headed back to the hills to destroy <br>what evil we could.&nbsp; Oh, many of us fell that day.&nbsp; We had the good <br>fortune to have obtained a bind in the city.&nbsp; Experience was gained <br>and lost, many of us found better weapons amongst the shattered bones <br>and plenty of gold was found.<br><br>Eventually the hills filled with powerful adventurers and the Guilds <br>called upon their members to gather for the war.&nbsp; The Undead War <br>raged for days in the hills around Qeynos until at last enough blood <br>had been spilled to satisify any God.&nbsp; Or GM! ;)<br><br>This was a 1-35 event that went for 8 actual hours.&nbsp; Tell us your <br>story, and I&#39;ll tell you about day werewolves ravaged the West <br>Commonlands!<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com/">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br><tt>
