This is all very well but i would not advise new players to use the Test<br/>
Server simply because Varent has said that characters created on the test<br/>
server are not immune from player wipes.� I would not feel very well if i<br/>
had worked up my player 10+ lvls and found that one day, the character was<br/>
deleted... its great for users to spend some time there..� heck i have 3<br/>
characters on there myself..� I just wouldnt advise a newbie to start there.<br/>

if nobody was on the test server they swould have trouble testing out the<br/>
weekly patches. It&#39;s actually quite nice there, not many people and it is<br/>
almost like solo play (for you whiners), and I heard it&#39;s alot easier to<br/>
raise a character in freeport because its not so crowded with people<br/>
stealing kills<br/>

maybe you should pick another server other than Test Server... most people<br/>
reside on the other servers.. im sure you will find someone that can help<br/>
you online there at the same level as you.<br/>

Last night I just started a Dark Elf.� <br/>
Walk on the Wild Side. <br/>
<br/>
My first real character experience requiring so much <br/>
swimming.� Anyhow, none of the NPC&#39;s, after frequent <br/>
hailings, appear to have a voice.� /Consider is very silly. <br/>
<br/>
I encoutered a few pets like a skeleton and <br/>
considered they were best to leave alone for now. <br/>
<br/>
There are some funny ghouls, one looks as if on patrol. <br/>
<br/>
West Freeport has it&#39;s bats, rats and snakes.� <br/>
What would I be looking for in the Dark City? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
