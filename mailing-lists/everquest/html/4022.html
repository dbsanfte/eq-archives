<b>Subject:</b> HI and Befallen quest question..... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128251971">Hi to all. Cahlia here, 19th season wood elf druid, who is trying <br/>
desperately to level to 20 and claim my surname heheh! Oy I hate <br/>
taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I was looking up a quest yesterday and found one I am <br/>
interested in. Starts in Felwithe talking to the high elf who stands <br/>
by the water and tells you he is troubled by his son&#39;s disappearance, <br/>
please talk to someone else. I found that if you go to Befallen and <br/>
kill a skeletal foreman, it will spawn Sir (something or other starts <br/>
with an A). I got the directions, etc. He gives you a token you take <br/>
back and give to the high elf and he gives you his daughter&#39;s token. <br/>
A pretty cool amulet with 3AC, +3wis, +3int, +3 cha, +3Sta, and +3 <br/>
agi I do believe. Anyhow....here&#39;s my question...can I make it in <br/>
Befallen at level 20 ok? I&#39;m scared from what I read to attempt it. <br/>
Apparently everything aggros terribly. EQAtlas says level 7-25+ mobs, <br/>
but since they are all necros and thermagists, the damages are much <br/>
worse than they con. I HATE dying, and I&#39;m too chicken to attempt <br/>
without some feedback. Any suggestions or stories?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
