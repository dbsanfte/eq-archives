<div id="ygrps-yiv-198225899">Alot of food and drinks give you boosts on your stats. Check out Misty <br/>
thicket picnics and 10lb Halas Met Pies. Now, those are going top of the <br/>
line foods but there are plenty that take a much lower trivial to produce <br/>
and still give you boosts.<br/>

   Howdy,<br/>
     I&#39;m relatively new to EQ, an I&#39;m sill feeling my way around things. I <br/>
do havfe a question. No th Trade skills, Im understand most of them, they&#39;re <br/>
pretty straitforward...but I do have a question bout the cooking one. Why? I <br/>
understand smithing...get ore, make bars, make weapons/armour...I know in <br/>
EQ, every so many time units, you automaticlly eat food. Since rations and <br/>
milk will fill this funcion,  what is the purpose of cookin and brewing? Do <br/>
you get more food value out of something you&#39;ve made, as oppoised to the <br/>
rations and bisquits? Can you eat the food and get boosts from it? Same <br/>
thing for the brewing? Or is it just a vanity thing to be walking around <br/>
with something you cooked as opposed to the iron raions and milk thing...<br/>
