personally don&#39;t think you did anything wrong..you basically pulled for camp 1 
even though you did not mean to and all the group did was let you get pounded so 
you&nbsp;ran off to save your life which is what I would of done in that 
situation.&nbsp; That group might of all been afk&nbsp;(doubt it) and when they 
got back on they thought&nbsp;that you trained them on purpose...but anyway if 
all their gonna do in the game is cause you problems then they are all immature 
and don&#39;t have much of a life.&nbsp; If it happens again you should take a 
screen shot of what they said and tell a gm about it..if he asks for the proof 
then you have it all right there...it&#39;ll take like a week to get a response back 
but thats the only sure way to take care of this problem...that or either ignore 
them.&nbsp; This kind of thing happened to me in Echo Caverns..I was wondering 
around looking for a spot to solo when this needlite comes out and attacks me 
from behind.&nbsp; I see a group of 3 people nearby in the needlite camp and I 
tell them I have a mob for you guys but all they did was sit there.they had no 
mobs in their area.&nbsp; I tell them again but I still get no response.&nbsp; 
By this time I lost about 2 bubs of health so I said screw it and killed it 
off.&nbsp; Later I get a shout telling everyone in the zone I am a KSer..now let 
me get this right isn&#39;t KSing killing a mob that someone else is already 
fighting?&nbsp; Or am I wrong?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span><br><br><span
