<div id="ygrps-yiv-423651864">I love Chivalry!  I might have to try a mail character just to see if there<br/>
is a difference in my perspective.  As far as Guild&#39;s..... I&#39;ve not become a<br/>
member of one yet.  I don&#39;t really have the time it takes to be in a Guild.<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t want to be a leader either.  I enjoy the game for what it is, a<br/>
game and I&#39;m having fun meeting new people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be playing Allilee and Maralexis tonight about 7 pm PDT if anyone on<br/>
Tarew wants to say hello.  Got to work on the little ones!<br/>

Kanalyn 16 Druid<br/>
Analyn 9 Beastlord<br/>
Allilee 6 Ranger<br/>
Maralexis 6 Wizard<br/>
