<div id="ygrps-yiv-15705119">Ahhh a cleric .. what a noble class, I prefer rogues myself. Anyway, <br/>
for newbies I recommend that you hang out at the dwarf fishing camp <br/>
and wait for someone to work over the named dorfs there. Hey drop <br/>
serious weapons and ringmail armour. You may be able to get them to <br/>
cough up some of the goods, since selling them locally will be tough <br/>
as they are ruining their faction with the Citizens of Kaladim. <br/>
Begging never hurt either.<br/>

&gt; Welcome to EQ. =) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Firstly, way to go on choosing a cleric! hehe I&#39;m biased as I play <br/>
a level 50 High Elf Cleric on Xegony. Clerics are a lot of fun imo. <br/>
As a new cleric I agree with some of the statements made below. Being <br/>
BRAND new, just solo around your starting point and loot everything. <br/>
Sell that stuff and save all the money. You will need it for spells <br/>
obviously and you&#39;ll also want to pick up some better armor than the <br/>
tunic your guild gives you. I wore leather armor for a very long time <br/>
until I had saved enough to buy something else. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you do get higher in level and can start buying some better <br/>
items, work on buying stuff that is +wis. This will help a lot. <br/>
Farther down the road at much higher levels you will want to work on <br/>
making your AC and saves better, but you shouldn&#39;t have to worry <br/>
about that too much for quite some time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone has different opinions on how to play, but the important <br/>
thing is to have fun. Find some people on your server that play in <br/>
your area. Usually you&#39;ll start seeing familiar faces. <br/>

&gt;   I have a 38 dwarf cleric on The Nameless.  A few tips:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   1) Max wisdom - not all subscribe to this, but you have an inate <br/>
strength already as a dwarf.  I put my other points to bring up <br/>
either dex or agility, whichever lower<br/>
&gt;   2) Find a regular partner to help you to level at the low levels -<br/>
 you can solo first few levels, but I found grouping with one other <br/>
PC helped<br/>
&gt;   3) As a cleric, go to Kurn&#39;s tower around level ten - lots of <br/>
undead to nuke on when alone and clerics were always welcome in <br/>
groups there<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Use the other yahoogroups specifically for clerics for more help <br/>
and advice: EQ_Cleric@y... and EQ-Clerics@y... - Some of the folks <br/>
there are quite, er, vocal and opinionated, hehe.  But we all know <br/>
that Dwarves make the best clerics - you picked the right race.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Use Caster&#39;s Realm and Rayne&#39;s cleric site for cleric reference <br/>
information.  Also Allakhazam&#39;s for a lot of general information.<br/>

&gt;   Hey guys,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I know I&#39;m about 2 years late but better late than never.  I am <br/>
on <br/>
&gt;   Ayonae Ro and just made a dwarf cleric.  Any little tips and <br/>
advice <br/>
&gt;   thrown my way will be very appreciated.  Beside saving up fo rmy <br/>
&gt;   spell, I bought the book, should I invest next for my armor? <br/>
weapon? <br/>
&gt;   or misc items such as rings?  Thanks again.<br/>
