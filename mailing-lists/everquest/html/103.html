<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357612323">I&#39;d tend to share Vespair opinion : I have some characters there who <br/>
are actually &quot;test&quot; characters for me. :)<br/>
But they are quite low levels and my main guys are on real servers. <br/>
Any way I love to go on the test server. When I don&#39;t have enough <br/>
time to play my bigger characters I can always ramble around with my <br/>
small test guys who are, slowly growing.<br/>
Another point is that they reset server and boot people without <br/>
warning usually, and I didn&#39;t pay for this as a permanent effect!<br/>

&gt;  This is all very well but i would not advise new players to use <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the Test Server simply because Varent has said that characters <br/>
created on the test server are not immune from player wipes.  I would <br/>
not feel very well if i had worked up my player 10+ lvls and found <br/>
that one day, the character was deleted... its great for users to <br/>
spend some time there..  heck i have 3 characters on there myself..  <br/>
I just wouldnt advise a newbie to start there.<br/>
