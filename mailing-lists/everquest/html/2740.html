I&#39;ve actually seen people telling newbies to do stuff like that. Or like<br/>
checking their xp by typing /ex.<br/>
The first thing my sister told me to do was to change my attack key to q so<br/>
I don&#39;t have that happening all the time.<br/>

&gt; I really like to find the lvl 1s who just logged in and don&#39;t know where<br/>
&gt; their guild is. I will take them to their guild, introduce them to their<br/>
&gt; guildmaster and maybe give them some patchwork armor. I have been known to<br/>
&gt; give tours of Kelethin to new players or visitors to the area. And I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; always more than happy to give peole details to quests so they can make<br/>
