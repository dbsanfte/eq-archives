<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049380985">Just started a new mage on a different server than the one I usually play on<br/>
(so I could play with my BF). Just wondering if anyone had any suggestions<br/>
for gear I can get her. I totally dont want to do the newbie gear quests if<br/>
I can help it. I&#39;d rather go out and buy some inexpensive armor.  Got a<br/>
decent robe for now, but at level 10 she&#39;s wearing nothing else but cloth<br/>
and the summoned focus items. Got any suggestions? (sniff... I&#39;m so used to<br/>
twinking my alts I forgot what it&#39;s like to work for your stuff hehe)</div>
