Not sure if you looked here,however, there is a section on the Everquest<br/>
website that has information pertaining to possible solutions to problems<br/>
with the Soundblaster Live series.  <br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Sound problems in Everquest<br/>

<br/>
Does anyone else have problems with &quot;choppy&quot; sound in game? I am <br/>
currently running a 1.2 gHz Gateway Athlon system with 512 MB of PC- 133<br/>
SDRAM, nVidia GeForce 2 Ultra with 64 MB, and a Sound Blaster <br/>
Live! X-Gamer 5.1 sound card. Operating System is Windows XP Home <br/>
Edition. Connection is via aDSL. I have downloaded and installed all <br/>
the latest drivers.<br/>
<br/>
My sound, particularly the music, &quot;stutters&quot; and repeats in the game <br/>
to the point it is almost unbearably annoying and I have to turn the <br/>
speakers off or way down. It does not appear to affect the video <br/>
and/or gameplay, but I should think my system is more than adequate <br/>
to play the game with sound turned on. <br/>
<br/>
I do have the Luclin expansion, and I have turned on a FEW of the <br/>
new skins, but only those of the races and genders of my own <br/>
characters: Wood Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, and Human (necessary to <br/>
display Erudite). I also have horses and elementals turned on, but <br/>
that is all. Social animations, mip mapping, texture mapping, and <br/>
texture compression are off.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried turning the sound acceleration down in Control Panel, <br/>
but that appears to have no effect on the choppiness of the sound. I <br/>
also turned sound realism up and turned off reverb by using /reverb <br/>
in the chat box, at one person&#39;s suggestion. Does anyone have any <br/>
ideas/tips/solutions? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
