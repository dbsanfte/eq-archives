<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789557764">I have seen one PC and one NPC that have what looks like a glowing, flashing <br/>
shield on thier left arm.  When I inspected the PC with this flashing thing <br/>
going on, she had a &quot;Light Globe&quot; (not Lightstone) in one of her melee slots, <br/>
so I assume it was not a shiled but rather a light source.  I really wanna <br/>
try to get one of these Light Globes.  Any one know where I can?<br/>
