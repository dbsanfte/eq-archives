<div id="ygrps-yiv-761332626">hmm... i forget the formula but if you are withint 10 levels of each <br/>
other you can get xp together.  Though, it&#39;s 5 levels within each <br/>
ohter in the beginning.  I forget when it starts to be 10 levels <br/>
apart.  Yes, you are right though.  This game is about fun not about <br/>
who gets to level 60 first.  That&#39;s what I asked myself with my <br/>
friends.  I always wondered why they always keep leveling instead of <br/>
doing other fun things.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m always behind my friends in <br/>
levels.  I&#39;m not always leveling.  I want to have fun.   I help <br/>
lowbies (levels 10+) or newbies by healing them, buffing them, etc.  <br/>
I just want to have fun by talking to others and maybe go trading.  I <br/>
will even maybe help my other friends who are lower level than me.  <br/>
If I don&#39;t do that, I probably will work on trading skills or skills <br/>
I don&#39;t care about that still is fun such as fishing hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we&#39;ve all heard of the RP server when it first came out.  I <br/>
think it&#39;s almost been a month ever since it&#39;s gone live.  If it&#39;s <br/>
what I think you&#39;re thinking of.  Sullon Zek right?  I think a lot of <br/>
people went over there because it sounded really cool. AND there&#39;s no <br/>
such thing as &quot;play nice&quot;.  Training people is actually encouraged so <br/>
you better watch out when a train comes.  I like to roleplay <br/>
sometimes but I&#39;m not a serious roleplaying player.  I like to <br/>
communicate with everyone and be able to roleplay at the same time <br/>
and also not roleplay whenever I want to.  So... I don&#39;t think that <br/>
server will fit me.  It&#39;s kinda cool for those who are serious <br/>
roleplaying players though or that find it fun to try.  Oh yes, <br/>
another thing.  You don&#39;t have to share camps.  All camps are like a <br/>
contest so... that&#39;s another thing to watch out.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t like powerleveling much, either.  As I had stated in my <br/>
original<br/>
&gt; post, I just want to get the husband&#39;s char up a level or two so we <br/>
can<br/>
&gt; travel together.  He&#39;s 10th and I&#39;m 16th.  I&#39;ve been playing for a <br/>
while<br/>
&gt; (though I had a long layover) and he&#39;s only been playing for a <br/>
month or so.<br/>
&gt; If I remember correctly, isn&#39;t the formula: level + (level/2) used <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; determine who can group and still gain exp?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think that I would ever want to be powerleveled, myself.  <br/>
It seems<br/>
&gt; like a big pain in the neck to get all one&#39;s stats up to par.  I <br/>
can also<br/>
&gt; honestly say that I really don&#39;t care if I ever get a character up <br/>
to 60th<br/>
&gt; lvl.  What&#39;s the point in reaching the end game as fast as you <br/>
can?  I say<br/>
&gt; have fun along the way and roleplay like you would with paper and <br/>
dice.<br/>
&gt; Okay, maybe not speaking in an mock English accent to the computer <br/>
screen<br/>
&gt; (at least not when anyone&#39;s looking), but still!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the way, has anyone heard anything about the new roleplaying <br/>
server?  Has<br/>
&gt; there been any word on when/if it will launch?  I&#39;d heard that they <br/>
were<br/>
&gt; trying to work out the kinks to make sure that no one could <br/>
communicate if<br/>
&gt; they didn&#39;t speak the same language.  I can see that this would be <br/>
a problem<br/>
&gt; if people used /emote to speak to each other, or even use their <br/>
character<br/>
&gt; description.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How many people would leave their present servers and characters <br/>
for the RP<br/>
&gt; server, I wonder?  I think I&#39;d give it a try.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Opinions vary. I personally find the whole power leveling idea to <br/>
be most<br/>
&gt; dishonorable. To see an orc camp taken over by a 50+ druid and a lv <br/>
6 ogre<br/>
&gt; warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer reminds me how people are <br/>
have no<br/>
&gt; willingness to work for things (the whole cheat code thing). But <br/>
many people<br/>
&gt; find it ok to twink/power level and, well, so be it. I can see it, <br/>
shiver,<br/>
&gt; and keep moving. Live and let live. I am fortunate that at lv 43 I <br/>
can solo<br/>
&gt; and this is only an inconvience at worse to me instead of a real <br/>
issue. But<br/>
&gt; up until lv 35 I was still having camps stolen from me by uber <br/>
twinks and<br/>
&gt; anon druids.<br/>
