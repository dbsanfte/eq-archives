 </span></blockquote>Here are some basic guidelines for quests:<br/>
 Hail the NPC<br/>
 Always read thru the dialogue<br/>
 If the npc gives you a container, HOLD ON TO IT.(i&#39;ve known people <br/>
who have actually gotten rid of them) If the container has a combine <br/>
button, make sure you hit it before turn in.<br/>
 If the npc wants more than 1 of the same item, make sure they aren&#39;t <br/>
stacked<br/>
 I personally will always hail the npc again even after I have <br/>
collected the pieces for a quest just to be sure I have the right <br/>
stuff.<br/>
 I also recommend checking out Allakhazams&#39; website for quest info or <br/>
ask on this message board.<br/>
 Hope this helps out.</div>
