&gt; &#92;&gt; If you&#39;re in the EC area, go to an Orc camp and<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunt, I always level nicely <br/>
&gt; &gt; there.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I was playing my dwarf warrior, I found that CB<br/>
&gt; and the surrounding orc camps were the best place to<br/>
&gt; level fast. Not only do you get XP for killing the<br/>
&gt; dratted things, but you learn pulling, group work --<br/>
&gt; if you happen to find a good group -- and you can get<br/>
&gt; XP from the dwarves for turning in CB belts,<br/>
&gt; shoulderpads and bracers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With my new Vah Shir rogue, I&#39;m finding the best way<br/>
&gt; to level quickly is to work on my throwing skill and<br/>
&gt; break camps. The Loda Kai camp near the mountains is<br/>
&gt; proving a great place to do both -- I throw, get a<br/>
&gt; couple skeletal brigands, kill them, heal for two<br/>
&gt; minutes, and then repeat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was levelling my dwarf in about...maybe not an hour<br/>
&gt; but certainly two if I put my mind to it and I was<br/>
&gt; levelling my rogue in at least two. It&#39;s  bit harder<br/>
&gt; now because I&#39;m level 12 working on 13, so it simply<br/>
&gt; takes longer.<br/>
