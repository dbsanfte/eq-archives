&gt; There is a video of him soloing Nagafen to the tune<br/>

&gt; &gt; I personally was bummed when they made it<br/>
&gt; impossible<br/>
&gt; &gt; to solo monks any more.  I haven&#39;t been feeling<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; urge to log in much since they did that, so I was<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the ones who voted to let people solo, even<br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; penality... I&#39;d enjoy it more than begging for<br/>
&gt; groups<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the planes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been in the game since 4/1/99 so I think I<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; say with certainty that its a million times easier<br/>
&gt; &gt; than it used to be.  Many more zones, much less<br/>
&gt; &gt; crowding, tons of more items, features like the<br/>
&gt; Bazaar<br/>
&gt; &gt; and being able to move around without a drood&#39;s<br/>
&gt; help,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc.  Its a better game now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But I&#39;d give it all back to not have to beg for<br/>
&gt; &gt; groups.  Sitting and spinning on my arse while I<br/>
&gt; wait<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a group desperate enough to take a monk is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bummer, and not fun in my view.  Figuring out a<br/>
&gt; &gt; stratagy to solo certain spots was great fun for<br/>
&gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; as well as the competition with other solo&#39;s for<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; good spots.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t care so much about the monk nerf power<br/>
&gt; wise<br/>
&gt; &gt; except that it came at a time when we were being<br/>
&gt; &gt; forced to group past 60... double whammy that<br/>
&gt; makes it<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard to get in a group.<br/>
