Castersrealm&#39;s Ranger creation guide suggests putting all 20 points into<br/>
stamina, but I ignored that when I made my WE Ranger (level 36 now), and put<br/>
all 20 points into strength. I didn&#39;t start regretting that until I got to<br/>
around level 25 or so, and would run out of stamina in longish fights, for<br/>
example multi spawns in High Keep basement. I really had to scramble to find<br/>
decent stamina gear to get my stamina up over 100, while at the same time<br/>
not sacrificing too much in the way of AC, which is also vital for a Ranger.<br/>
<br/>
Since Rangers are a chainmail class, they don&#39;t have to worry quite as much<br/>
about the weight of their gear as the plate wearing classes do, and nice +<br/>
strength gear seems to be a lot more abundant than nice + stamina gear.<br/>
<br/>
I would say put all 20 pts into stamina, like Castersrealm suggests, or<br/>
maybe 15 stamina, 5 strength. If it were not for the fact that Texxas&#39;s<br/>
fletching skill is at 181, I would re-start him, putting all points into<br/>
stamina.<br/>

&gt; Could someone please let me know where I should put my extra points<br/>
&gt; for my wood elf ranger that i&#39;m creating. I&#39;ve read tons of guides<br/>
&gt; and just about everything there is to know about the ranger class,<br/>
&gt; but now I wanna hear it from some people that have actually played<br/>
&gt; one before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is their starting stats...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;           STR  STA  AGI   DEX  WIS  INT  CHA<br/>
&gt; Wood Elf  70   75   105   80   85   75   75<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 20 Extra points can be added... thanx.<br/>
