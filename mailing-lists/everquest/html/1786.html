<div id="ygrps-yiv-674587738">Any of you familiar with using a Monk?  Cuz I haven&#39;t.  I&#39;m a total <br/>
newbie with a monk.  Never used one, don&#39;t know how I should start <br/>
with a monk.  Any of you monk amateurs or experts want to give me <br/>
some suggestions how I should start my monk on character creation and <br/>
onward?  That&#39;ll be great.  And for those who are on Druzzil Ro, you <br/>
can help me out too because that&#39;s where I&#39;m gonna be making my <br/>
character.  I don&#39;t know what my character name is gonna be yet but <br/>
if you guys want to chat, meet me, or help me on druzzil ro, I would <br/>
love to know what your character names are.  Now here&#39;s a question, <br/>
Should I be a human monk or an iksar monk?  I know there are only two <br/>
races you can be for a monk.  Anyway, there I am.  Plus the other <br/>
reason for making this character is to meet somoene who is going to <br/>
be married which I met on Vazaelle.  So she asked if I could go to <br/>
her wedding.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m making this character but since I&#39;m <br/>
gonna make a character to meet her, might as well use that character <br/>
in good use.  I was gonna make a new character anyway on a different <br/>
server that has better economy than Vazaelle.  Anyway, I would <br/>
appreciate the help you guys can give me.</div>
