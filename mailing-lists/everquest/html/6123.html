<div>&nbsp;Adding again to what Froon said below as far as the Jewelcraft is concerned you have to have an Enchanter to enchant the metal or you won&#39;t get stats on the jewelry, I don&#39;t know about other guilds but as far as the one I&#39;m in if one of our enchanters has the time they will at no cost enchant the metals for you otherwise you&#39;re going to have to make friends with one or pay for their time. My chanter has her baking at 217, brewing 170, jewelcraft 182, etc as she is working on the coldain shawl quest.</div>
<div>The added bonus if you look closely at the example here, it&#39;s a magic item not a lore item so you can wear two of them at the same time, many of the items dropped from mobs are lore item and can only have one on your person or in your bank.</div>

I do havfe a question. No th Trade skills, Im understand most<br>of them, they&#39;re pretty straitforward...but I do have a question bout<br>the cooking one. Why? I understand smithing...get ore, make bars, make<br>weapons/armour...I know in EQ, every so many time units, you<br>automaticlly eat food. Since rations and milk will fill this funcion,<br>what is the purpose of cookin and brewing? Do you get more food value<br>out of something you&#39;ve made, as oppoised to the rations and bisquits?<br>Can you eat the food and get boosts from it? Same thing for the<br>brewing? Or is it just a vanity thing to be walking around with<br>something you cooked as opposed to the iron raions and milk thing...<br><br>The short answer is that higher level baked goods (e.g. Misty Thicket<br>Picnics) and brewed items (e.g. Qeynos Afternoon Tea) boost stats<br>significantly when consumed. <br><br>Trade skills get complicated at higher levels.... they are<br>interconnected. For example, in order to make a Misty Thicket Picnic,<br>which is baking, you need to be able to brew at a decent level to make<br>jumjum beer and also be able to tailor and do blacksmithing -- to make<br>the basket -- in addition to baking. Brewing also benefits fletching,<br>you need to brew oak bark tannin in order to *brew* light mithril<br>string, a component in high level wood elf cultural bows. And so forth.<br><br>Oh, yes, if you get to Level 250 and want to make your trophy, you<br>will also need a fairly good Jewelcrafting and Blacksmithing skill.<br><br>Froon<br><br><br><br><br></span></blockquote></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br>
