<div id="ygrps-yiv-946802088">-As a warrior, I planned the use of archery as a pulling tool. I <br/>
didn&#39;t expect to do much damage with the bow. I just figured on <br/>
fletching and making bows and learning how to use the skill to it&#39;s <br/>
best as I learned the game from a warrior&#39;s perspective.<br/>
<br/>
The site by the name &quot;Fletching Guide by Aoenla&quot; has some nice info. <br/>
You might look there. And &quot;EQ Traders Corner&quot; has good stuff as well.<br/>
<br/>
I am rather new to fletching, so as I learn more I will try to share.<br/>

and planned to focus on this skill, but a friend has just told me <br/>
that Archery is broken and serves no purpose but to pull albeit from <br/>
great distances.  I was hoping that a well developed archer, along <br/>
with snare could do most damage to mobs before its arrival.  If this <br/>
not true I find it staggering.  Its fine for casters to snare, DD and <br/>
DoT - ie fighting from a distance, but not bow-wielders?  <br/>
