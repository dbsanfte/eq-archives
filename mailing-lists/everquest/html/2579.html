<div id="ygrps-yiv-471170705">Really, the only affordable way to acquire magic weapons is to buy them from<br/>
other players. You can also quest some, but those are mostly higher level<br/>
quests.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen Axe of the Iron Back sell for as little as 20pp on my server,<br/>
Tarew Marr. Sometimes higher levels will even give them away. That is a<br/>
decent magical 2 handed slashing weapon for a lower level warrior, and I<br/>
think they might be bard usable as well, but not sure.<br/>
<br/>
You can quest the screaming mace in Crushbone, which is a fair magical 1<br/>
handed blunt. I think that quest can be done at lower levels. The langseax<br/>
quest in Halas can be done by pretty low levels too. Sometimes you get<br/>
langseax of the wolves (2hs warrior only) from that quest, but most times<br/>
you get a langseax (1hs warrior only).<br/>
