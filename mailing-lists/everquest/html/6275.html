<b>Subject:</b> HI ALL...some thoughts too <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888984411">Hey all, I am back after a short leave of absence. It&#39;s a long and<br/>
boring story, something I a m sure you don&#39;t care to hear, even if I<br/>
cared to tell ya..lol.  But anyway, here are my thoughts on stuff. You<br/>
can listen to my thoughts and take my advice, listen and laugh at me,<br/>
or click on another post. The choice is yours.<br/>
<br/>
As far as AA&#39;s go, personally when my wizard hit 51/52, I did infact<br/>
do the AA route. It was a personal choice, I felt that a wizard as<br/>
good as mine is/was, needed the title &quot;Baron&quot; and so forth he got that<br/>
title. Now In think of it tho, Master sounds better, but I<br/>
digresslol.. I did put the points into Run3 and Mana regen ( me<br/>
thinks). I have number 8 into int. Even though I can move onto the<br/>
next level of AA&#39;s, class specific I think?, I choose not to, and<br/>
decided to continue on with the general abilities. (Excuse if my info<br/>
is off, its been awhile and pulling it from memory.<br/>
<br/>
Now as for mounts, they do have their good sides and bad sides. Good<br/>
that you can med and move around, so your not a target for mobs and<br/>
such. Some look cool, if your all about the bling. I do not know about<br/>
horses, but my wizard has a white drog and when it runs, I &quot;feel&quot; like<br/>
I am on a roller coaster, or perhaps an incredibly bumpy road with no<br/>
shocks on the car.. Also sadly, I don&#39;t know about horses, but when I<br/>
go into water with my drog, it shrivels up and hides.seems vaguely<br/>
familiar to me and another lizard.ROFL. Sorry..:-(<br/>
<br/>
But movement is kind of bad with the slow horse. For me, it wasn&#39;t so<br/>
much for movement, but for safety and meditation. But, besides the<br/>
water thing, I thing you should be able to name them like you would a<br/>
toon. But, this also goes with beastlord warder&#39;s, we should be able<br/>
to name them..so instead of &quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;Bob&#39;s Warder&quot; you would have<br/>
&quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;Ralph&quot;..lol..or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I had a question, but now I cant recall what it was,,oh well..<br/>
<br/>
As always..<br/>
