<div id="ygrps-yiv-945294803"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have seen a lot of people with guild names on my server and I was really<br/>
&gt; wondering what the benefit of being in a guild would be to going it<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; one???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a great benefit. If you&#39;re lost or need information you can ask guild<br/>
members. If you need help with something you can generally find guild<br/>
members who will help you. If you&#39;re hacked off about someone in group or<br/>
things not going your way-- maybe you can&#39;t ge into group-- you can talk to<br/>
your guild members. It&#39;s like an unlimited friends list and you can talk to<br/>
all of them at once. And guild raids can be fun!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I mean I can always find someone to group with... or solo it on the blue&#39;s<br/>
&gt; and blacks....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but there are times when you might not have anyone to talk to. Or you<br/>
can&#39;t get a group. Or you need a tp or rez and can&#39;t find anyone in your<br/>
area. Of coruse when you get higher lvl you can help lower lvl guild members<br/>
as well. It&#39;s give and take. It&#39;s fun. At least in my experience.<br/>
Oh, and if you want to transfer something from one alt to another it&#39;s best<br/>
to go thru a guildmember rather than a stranger.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are lots of them.<br/>

&gt; ok got to run just wondering<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok. Have fun!<br/>
