<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649939959">Sk&#39;s have all the &quot;Spear&quot; spells that are DD. And the <br/>
various &quot;Darkness&quot; spells are GREAT for getting Agro. I pull with <br/>
the &quot;Darkness&quot; spell lots. Slows the incoming mob down, gives ya a <br/>
chance to cast again with another DOT or now use the &quot;Spear&quot; spell <br/>
to gain some more agro. Also allows others that maybe have a bow to <br/>
plink a few arrows or for other casters to cast a spell such as slow <br/>
or whatever.<br/>
As far as weapons, practice them all. I personnaly think for a SK, <br/>
that a 1HB or a 1HS and a shield work great. But are some nice 2H <br/>
also, just a bit to slow for my tastes, but nice dmage on the 2H.<br/>
I practice my weapon skills if I&#39;m not in group, but am near a full <br/>
group. Send one in the group a tell and ask if its ok if you help <br/>
kill outta group. Usually they will more than welcome your help. You <br/>
wont get XP, and you sure won&#39;t gain agro agaisnt the whole group if <br/>
you let them beat on it for a second. Use your worst weapon skill <br/>
and smack that sucker. Usually sooner or later someone leaves the <br/>
group and you will get right in 99 times out of a 100.<br/>

&gt; Hello All:<br/>
&gt; I started an alt SK and wanted to know what is a good focus effect <br/>
for them <br/>
&gt; if that makes sense.  They don&#39;t seem to have any Direct Damage <br/>
spells that <br/>
&gt; I could see on the spell list so that is out.<br/>
&gt; Also, having a hard time finding a decent weapon for my SK.  I <br/>
have one now <br/>
&gt; that does 28 damage with no stats--should I go for lower damage <br/>
and more <br/>
&gt; stats or stay with high damage and no stats. lololol.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks :)<br/>
