<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693970605">Speaking of fun, my brother (lvl 27 Paladin), my guildmate (lvl 20 warr) and<br/>
myself (lvl 29 cleric) owned Crushbone yesterday. We went in and killed<br/>
every single orc just for fun. There was nobody else there so we owned the<br/>
place. It was great!<br/>
luv,<br/>
