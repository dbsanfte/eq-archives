<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075636982"><p>A little info... what class is she? (Magician, Wizard, Druid... ) and what&nbsp; level? Casters start out with 2 spells, they are in your inventory. You have to scribe them in your spell book, then &quot;memorize&quot; them by putting the spells into the spell slots (it&#39;s that box with 8 little holes in it). Then to cast, you click on the memorized spell icon.
<p>I hope this wasn&#39;t TOO basic, hehe... let us know if you need more help. :)
