&gt; Excuse me, but EQ techs actually tell people to disable their firewalls to<br/>
&gt; play the game!!! I have seen them do it at tech chats!<br/>
&gt; Alot of people don&#39;t know that they are at risk. Maybe if Verant warned<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; it could happen they would know and understand how to protect themselves.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not their faults if they are ignorant of malicious hackers. Verant is<br/>
&gt; NOT ignorant of it.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
<br/>
Yes! I called Verant Tech Support to try to solve my problem of excessive<br/>
LDs. The VERY first question they asked me was if I had a firewall<br/>
installed. When I told them I was using  ZoneAlarm, they not only told me to<br/>
disable it while playing EQ, they told me to totally un-install it. In<br/>
addition, they told me to disable Norton Anti-Virus Auto-Protect while<br/>
playing the game.<br/>
<br/>
Those two steps did seem to reduce the incidence of LDs, but it didn&#39;t<br/>
entirely eliminate them. I feel pretty uncomfortable about invasion, though.<br/>
