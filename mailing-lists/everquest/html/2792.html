<b>Subject:</b> How much will you pay to play? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-396312717">My previous post touched on this. I have thought about it a bit. We <br/>
pay less than $200 a year just to play. Not bad. I spent at least <br/>
$500 on GamesWorkshop products each year when I was more active <br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a problem dropping the monthly fee. It is quite <br/>
reasonable. I might be able to dump another $500 a year into <br/>
upgrades. Unfortunately, my machine is now pretty much maxed. So I <br/>
must hope that I can hold out at the present level long enough to get <br/>
together the funds for a more upgradeable tower.<br/>
<br/>
How much are others willing to pay to play?<br/>
