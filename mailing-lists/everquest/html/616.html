         There are better weapons out there but I believe they are obtainable<br/>
later on in levels. As an example, the Observer Staff is part of a quest that<br/>
usually Level 30+ can complete. But you can also purchase the item but<br/>
again, I doubt a level 10 could have accumulated over 200-300 plat. I am<br/>
not saying it is impossible, but what I am saying is that what you have now<br/>
is excellent and should last you until at least level 20 or 30.<br/>
<br/>
         As for the Sense Animal spell, you can obtain that at any Druid<br/>
Guild. I believe the closest one to you from Halas is the Druid Guild<br/>
at Surefall Glen, I believe that is the name of the zone. If you ever need<br/>
any of the Animal Spells, the druids carry all those spells.<br/>
<br/>
         Hope this helps.<br/>
