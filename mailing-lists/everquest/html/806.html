<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044725182">Well, you pegged me right on the nose! :) I&#39;m the<br/>
person who&#39;s license plate frame says &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
discriminate, I hate everyone!&quot; And yes, I hate<br/>
it when people bump into me...<br/>

&gt; bothers me, and if it does, it just shows<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re getting into the game a<br/>
&gt; little too much.  The only time this should<br/>
&gt; ever make you feel uneasy is if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re on a PvP server because they&#39;re scoping<br/>
&gt; for your items to see if they<br/>
&gt; should kill you usually.  If this honestly<br/>
&gt; bothers you, I would imagine you<br/>
&gt; the type of person who is claustrophobic or who<br/>
&gt; gets upset if someone bumps<br/>
&gt; into you in the subway or something along those<br/>
&gt; lines.  Eventually, you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; take it with an air of pride must likely,<br/>
&gt; because it&#39;s usually just newbies<br/>
&gt; gawking over your equipment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; I find it kind of rude for people to be<br/>
&gt; snooping<br/>
&gt; &gt; in other peoples stuff! Is &#39;inspect&#39; a<br/>
&gt; totally<br/>
&gt; &gt; accepted thing, or is there some sort of<br/>
&gt; &gt; ettiquette that goes along with it? I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mind<br/>
&gt; &gt; so much if I&#39;ve been chatting with someone<br/>
&gt; for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little while and they take a peek [it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have anything good to hide!] but when<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; come right up to you, snoop, and then don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; &gt; respond when you say &#39;Hail&#39; , I find that<br/>
&gt; &gt; extremely annoying. Any comments, guys?<br/>
