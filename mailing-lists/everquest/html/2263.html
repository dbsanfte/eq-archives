<b>Subject:</b> the gift of sow <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251967457">Thought I would move the discussion to a new thread.<br/>
<br/>
I like to sow and buff freely because I think it builds good will in <br/>
the game. I am convinced that such good will comes back. A gift, a <br/>
hand, good advice. I cannot always afford to cross zones to do so, <br/>
but when I can I like to sow and buff.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I can port, I have decided to do so without thought of <br/>
reward. Oh, of course I will go quite a bit out of my way for an <br/>
offer of good money, but I have found giving a port to someone unable <br/>
to give much in return seems to add to the game in other ways than <br/>
money. <br/>
<br/>
It is similar to the way I like to drive. I try to adjust my speed <br/>
and position in traffic to optimize the ability of other drivers to <br/>
move in and out and through the traffic. My thought is if we all move <br/>
along better I will get where I am going in reasonable time and <br/>
minimal stress. Not a perfect theory, and it does not work all of the <br/>
time. But at worst it is a comfortable fiction.<br/>
