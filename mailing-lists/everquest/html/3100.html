<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657898965">Nuada Armat&#39;gh asked about in-game marriages.  I guess a lot of <br/>
people don&#39;t take them very seriously and so they turn out badly.  <br/>
But then, some don&#39;t.  We&#39;re one of those &quot;nice&quot; stories.  It <br/>
actually all started pre-EQ on The Realm.  We met, fell in love, and <br/>
were married on The Realm in their chapel along with loads of <br/>
friends.  We have now been together for over 4 years and are married <br/>
in real life and playing EQ together on our computers. <br/>
<br/>
Gamewise, there really aren&#39;t any implications other than a general <br/>
notice of the marriage.  It doesn&#39;t actually affect game play at <br/>
all.  And so, in real life, it isn&#39;t any commitment unless you chose <br/>
to make it one.  It&#39;s just that too many people take the idea of an <br/>
in-game marriage too lightly and others too seriously.<br/>
<br/>
So think twice before asking or accepting a marriage proposal.  <br/>
Remember that avatar you&#39;re looking at has a real person behind it <br/>
who has real feelings, cares, and concerns.<br/>
