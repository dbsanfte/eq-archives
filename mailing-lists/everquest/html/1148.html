<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EverQuest] Why have Rangers? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645646244">The only thing I liked as a mid 40&#39;s enchanter trying to solo the Ice Giants<br/>
outside perma, without using charms, was some way to slow their movement.  I<br/>
could fear and had the melee dmg of my pet to kill them.  So I could get a<br/>
necro (who didn&#39;t need me really), a druid (Snare, heals, dots, dd), Shadow<br/>
Knight (Darkness, melee), or a Ranger (snare, taunt for resists, sow, small<br/>
heals but fine for healing a low hp caster).  I&#39;ve done all of them and I<br/>
think the Ranger was best for lowest amount of down time were able to kill<br/>
all 3 usually before the first one spawned again.  To anyone that has hunted<br/>
here you know that&#39;s pretty good esp pre 50+.  Druid would run out of Mana<br/>
to quick with the fast spawn times.  If the ranger just stayed smart and<br/>
back off when fear wore off incase I get resisted then we would do very<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Rangers are an Enchanter&#39;s best partner in many outdoor zones.  Burning<br/>
Woods and Cobalt Scar come to mind. The fear pathing in Cobalt Scar is nice<br/>
and they dont run too far off.  Just hope no body is kitting those God<br/>
forsaken Drakes.  That AoE is HUGE!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;why have a ranger at all?<br/>

an irritant and a waste of time better spent medding. <br/>

&gt; That&#39;s what I think.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I mean it...once the druids get tracking at level<br/>
&gt; 20...why have a ranger at<br/>
&gt; all?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; just me bitching is all :&gt;<br/>
