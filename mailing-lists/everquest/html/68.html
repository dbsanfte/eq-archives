<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899122552">Since i didn&#39;t attach it to the last note my own email address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:vanasse@...">vanasse@...</a>.<br/>
And the quests in the aquaducts include among others i assume, finding Ronn Castekin for his sister in Surefall glade, last seen entering the aquaducts with a man in black through the north pond. Finding evidence of the death or whatever of a guards daughter last seen playing in the south pond. Killing the rat king and giving his head to one of the temple of thunder paladins. Delivering a letter to an undercover temple of thunder operative in the bloodsaber temple down there.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t managed any of those. And the bloodsaber guards kill me as soon as i set foot in the door with 100+ dmg hits. So the undercover thing seems a little hard for me to do.<br/>
