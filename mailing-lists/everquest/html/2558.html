<div id="ygrps-yiv-414041478">Yeah. I sometimes keep items around to give to newbies later. Even when my<br/>
druid was only lvl 10 I would turn in CB belts and come back with armor to<br/>
give to low lvls.<br/>
It&#39;s actually part of my guild practice to help others. The Spellbinders<br/>
pride ourselves on being kind to others. The other day a guy was stuck in a<br/>
pit in West Freeport. he was diseased and couldn&#39;t move around without<br/>
getting killed from the disease/dot. He didnt know how to get out and had<br/>
less than 40hp left. So I called a wizard guildmate to TL him to his bind<br/>
point. I waited at his bind point to heal and cure him. It felt good to help<br/>
someone. :-)<br/>
luv,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This is exactly what happened to me.  i had asked if<br/>
&gt; anyone could help a young druid stand a fighting<br/>
&gt; chance on her own...i was meaning just buffs...along<br/>
&gt; came this WONDERFUL person who suited me with some<br/>
&gt; basic leather armor and gave me 50pp to boot to help<br/>
&gt; buy my spells...i was amazed!!!  He said he was<br/>
&gt; fulfilling a promise...i will be glad to one day have<br/>
&gt; the opportunity to give back to another who is just<br/>
&gt; starting out...What is it they say...&quot;Pay It<br/>
&gt; Forward&quot;??<br/>

&gt; &gt; Heh. Yeah. I&#39;ve found that being friendly with<br/>
&gt; &gt; people is profitable. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; do it for money, I like to be nice and joke with<br/>
&gt; &gt; people. The other day some<br/>
&gt; &gt; guy gave me 100pp just for emoting something.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And high lvl druids have been nice to my druid. One<br/>
&gt; &gt; walked up and gave her a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bunch of armor, a Forest Loop, and a wraithbone<br/>
&gt; &gt; hammer!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Very sweet of him.<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
