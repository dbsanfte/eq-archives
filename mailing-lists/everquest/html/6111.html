&gt;messed up graphics showed. ok it&#39;s a game folks if we can&#39;t poke fun at the<br/>
&gt;way we&#39;re drawn then it&#39;s a pretty sorry world. Personally I think the<br/>
&gt;designers are all T&A men cause have you noticed how most of the female mobs<br/>
&gt;when they die they collapse on all fours with their butts sticking in the<br/>
&gt;air while the men just kind of lay there<br/>

&gt;Hey I like females as well =) oh wait you meant playing Female characters my<br/>
&gt;bad =P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Seriously though I have no experience with EQ Frontiers since i dot have a<br/>
&gt;PS2 and I&#39;m not sure I wanna give sony anymore cash than they are getting<br/>
&gt;form me already with the EQ1 accounts I have already.  But if the females<br/>
&gt;are anything like the ones on EQ1 and  have the same races go for the High<br/>
&gt;Elf or De chicks they always tend to be sexy to me in my book.  Though the<br/>
&gt;Barbarians have nice top heavy features to em as well =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah i know some of the ladies on this list are probably calling me a<br/>
&gt;typical male pig. Please allow me to assure you ladies I&#39;m not yer typical<br/>
&gt;male. As Wulfric knows I&#39;m a perfect gentleman when it comes to the ladies<br/>
&gt;of our species and I&#39;ll not change that ever =)<br/>
