<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321196749">Actually, it depends on the group you get stuck in. I got stuck in a group<br/>
where I made no money at all for several hours bc they had split off and the<br/>
tanks were ninja-looters. Since I was busy healing and medding I got<br/>
nothing. But I needed xp and faction... So, you can expect to get loot if<br/>
you are in a good group. Just establish loot order first. If you want money<br/>
rather than xp you better be ready to move along to different places to look<br/>
for coin if you get stuck with a bad group.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Generally speaking, you don&#39;t get as much money when you solo.  You<br/>
&gt; get a lot more money when you group.  Sure, you probably don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; everything for yourself but because the groups can pull fast and<br/>
&gt; kill &#39;em, you generally get more money that way even if you are doing<br/>
&gt; alpha looting.  If you can get into a group, you probably can make<br/>
&gt; money that way.  Try the aviaks group in SK.  You can probably do it<br/>
&gt; at 19.  And yeah, Lena&#39;s correct, if you can get a few more levels<br/>
&gt; you can group in paw or whatever cuz they drop a lot of FS weapons.<br/>
&gt; Though, killing gnolls can get really boring after a while.<br/>
