<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651355074">I just got the download finished and popped over there to look <br/>
around. In case you thought the auto download should have grabbed it <br/>
with last patch, no such luck. Had to use advanced and do a thorough <br/>
search to get the files. Took only 1.5 hrs., but that was with nobody <br/>
disturbing the machine during download.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the look of the entry area of the zone. Judging by the number <br/>
of various bodies around the entrance portal marker, I would <br/>
recommend invisible for any travelers with even the sleightest doubt <br/>
about faction.<br/>
<br/>
The zone looked nice, and a quick track scan indicated a nice variety <br/>
of quarry ranging from dark blue to red for level 33. Rolling hills, <br/>
sparse woods, lots of big boulders which may hide mobs. Looked open <br/>
enough for kiting, but even near the entry point the mobs were <br/>
visible and fairly thick. <br/>
<br/>
I got a bit of lag, but I need to defrag and tune a bit before I know <br/>
just how to handle the zone.<br/>
