<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi hope that someone with SoL can help me out here.while having a<br/>
&gt; stroll round Shar Val I hailed Merchant Ahlam, He gave me this<br/>
&gt; quest.Merchant Ahlam says &#39;Ah good I was hoping you&#39;d be along soon.I<br/>
&gt; need you to collect some Gravel tea leaves from below the city.  I<br/>
&gt; need these leaves to make some tea for the guards under the arena.  I<br/>
&gt; need 10 of these leaves to brew enough tea for the guards. Take this<br/>
&gt; pouch and fill it with leaves and return it to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now by under the city I assumed he means the newbie pit have looked<br/>
&gt; all over and cannot find any leaves does anyone here know of this<br/>
&gt; quest? and if so where should I be looking?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Help please Purrgara<br/>
