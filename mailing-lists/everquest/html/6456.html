<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Not me.  I prefer grouping.  It&#39;s faster xp than soloing in my opinion.  As a 65 <br/>
&gt; druid, I can solo a lot of things, but it takes too much time to kill them.  <br/>
&gt; Root, snare, dot, dot, dot.  Sit and wait.  Keep that up til the mob is dead.  <br/>
&gt; In a group, most times I only have to worry about snaring and dotting, and maybe <br/>
&gt; back up healing.  It&#39;s not as labor intensive, and the xp moves faster with <br/>
&gt; constant pulls.  Unfortunately, lately, it seems like it&#39;s been increasingly <br/>
&gt; more difficult to find good groups so I end up soloing most of the time anyway <br/>
&gt; with LFG on.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   After a year and a half of playing, I&#39;ve done a lot of group play and<br/>
&gt;   a lot of duoing, but I seem to enjoy soloing more nowdays.  I can go<br/>
&gt;   where I want, do what I want and keep the loot and xp for myself. <br/>
&gt;   Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still like to group, but sometimes, for my own<br/>
&gt;   peace of mind, I much prefer soloing.  Anyone else?<br/>
