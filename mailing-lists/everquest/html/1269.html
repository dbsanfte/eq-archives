<div id="ygrps-yiv-944073707">Hi Mu :)<br/>
<br/>
&lt; I don&#39;t see what is so rude about &quot;Can I get a<br/>
SoW?&quot;.  Maybe its just me, don&#39;t know.  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just that they don&#39;t say please, and this really<br/>
irks me.  My parents had this annoying thing they did<br/>
to me growing up where if I said something like &quot;Can I<br/>
get some orange juice?&quot; they&#39;d say &quot;I don&#39;t know, can<br/>
you?&quot; intending me to say &quot;May I please have some<br/>
juice.&quot;  So I&#39;m warped anyway ;-P<br/>
<br/>
Besides, saying &quot;please&quot; is only polite, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Nymue<br/>
