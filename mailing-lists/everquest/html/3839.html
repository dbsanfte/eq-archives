<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606446076">Still can&#39;t get on today. Third day without EQ fix. Getting bad. <br/>
Thinking Earth and Beyond looks promising. Wrote the techs for <br/>
support. <br/>
<br/>
Had this happen last year. Three days in a row. All my days off. <br/>
Sucked big time. The error corrected itself, somehow. I just don&#39;t <br/>
want to wait. Missing game time.<br/>
<br/>
AAArrghh!<br/>
