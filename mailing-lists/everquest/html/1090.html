<b>Subject:</b> Ok..new bard here. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-98588503">I just made a bard on Tallos Zek (And I don&#39;t have to tell you how frickin<br/>
difficult it is to get out the main gate without getting attacked) and I&#39;ve<br/>
heard that you can play more than one song at a time.  Is this a system bug<br/>
or something that bards can actually do?</div>
