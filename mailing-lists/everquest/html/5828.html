<div id="ygrps-yiv-861288528">It appears that no one seems very happy with the task system.  I think it is<br/>
because we are disillusioned from what SOE originally touted it as - a way<br/>
to gain xp for people who don&#39;t have very long to play and unable to find<br/>
groups.  It&#39;s not like that at all.  Tasks should be simple, quick, and<br/>
easy.  They should not require hours of your time and the need of a full<br/>
group to accomplish.  I&#39;ve only done the one task, but it took me the better<br/>
part of 4 hours.  Had it not been for several others in the zone working on<br/>
the same or similar quests, I never would have finished it.  Another beef I<br/>
have is that not all the information is presented to you when you get the<br/>
task.  When I accepted it, it said I must kill 10 reanimated creatures in<br/>
chardok and loot 4 bone chips.  That&#39;s it, nothing more.  Once I had<br/>
completed the task, I thought I was supposed to go turn the bone chips into<br/>
the same guy I had gotten the task from, but no, now new information was<br/>
showing, saying that I had to go find some guy in Burning Woods and hand the<br/>
bone chips to him!  Why couldn&#39;t it have said that from the start and I<br/>
could have saved myself A LOT of time!  Finding him was no easy task either<br/>
since BW is a big zone.  So I think unless SOE revamps the task system to be<br/>
more commensurate to what they stated it would be, many people won&#39;t be<br/>
doing them.<br/>

&gt; The only task I could get was the dreadlands as well.  It sent me to scout<br/>
&gt; out a lava flow in skyfire.  To get the ok message I had to get in the<br/>
lava<br/>
&gt; and aggroed several mobs.  Thank goodness for sow, I out ran them then<br/>
&gt; ported out.  The next task was to explore the first bridge in Veeshan&#39;s<br/>
&gt; peak.  It is locked and requires a key that is no small quest.  This is<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; soloable.  Oh well, back to grinding.  This is typical, SOE&#39;s idea of solo<br/>
&gt; only requires a group of 5 or 6.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve now got a couple of my characters working on tasks. My 49 ranger<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; advised by the task masters to go to Rathe Mountains for a task. I did,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything was pointing me to Lower Guk. I&#39;ve never really been through<br/>
&gt; &gt; Upper and Lower Guk, and going that far underground with a ranger just<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; me concerned.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I abandoned the task. The next thing I tried was getting a task from a<br/>
&gt; &gt; task<br/>
&gt; &gt; master in Overthere. It sent me into Burning Woods, where one of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; things<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had to do was enter the giant fort and scout it out. To accomplish<br/>
that,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; discovered I had to run into the middle of the fort. I was invisible,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; soon as I got within agrro range, I started wailed on by a giant.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thankfully, a group was pulling giants from the fort, so it was somewhat<br/>
&gt; &gt; abandoned. I trained a giant or two out and ran for the zone line. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; next<br/>
&gt; &gt; step is to kill 10 skeletons (can&#39;t remember exactly what type, but I<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; &gt; they con dark blue -- not sure how well bow-kiting will work in such a<br/>
&gt; &gt; busy<br/>
&gt; &gt; zone).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Frustrated with such difficult and dangerous tasks for my 49 ranger, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried<br/>
&gt; &gt; a task with 10 cleric. I was sent into Innothule Swamp from a PoK task<br/>
&gt; &gt; master and told to kill 10 bull alligators (most con white, some a<br/>
healthy<br/>
&gt; &gt; dark blue). I had to run for my life and died about 10 feet from the PoK<br/>
&gt; &gt; book. I didn&#39;t realize bull alligators helped each other out. I got<br/>
&gt; &gt; trounced<br/>
&gt; &gt; by two of them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m becoming increasingly convinced that tasks are not soloable. :(<br/>

&gt; &gt; The only place that would give me a task was in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dreadlands, and it sent me ( a 52 Druid) into Chardok<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a recon mission.  Thought it couldn&#39;t be that bad,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I had never been to Chardok before.  The mission<br/>
&gt; &gt; was to enter the fort inside Chardok and explore the<br/>
&gt; &gt; area around the first bridge.  Went in and found the<br/>
&gt; &gt; fort (was invised) opened the door, it squeaks and<br/>
&gt; &gt; every mob in Chardok seems to have heard it, and what<br/>
&gt; &gt; resulted can only be described as Woodelf paste.<br/>
