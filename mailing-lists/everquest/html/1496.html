<div id="ygrps-yiv-970357153">I have found www.eqdruids.com to be an invaluable resource.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what they say in the Battle Tactics section; it pretty much agrees<br/>
with what Su said, but gives a slightly different perspective. This is a<br/>
direct cut and paste from the web page, so please don&#39;t flame me for the<br/>
slightly offensive language contained herein.<br/>

I have been sent many emails on both sides of the coins on animal slaughter<br/>
for druids...here are the FACTS...role play to what you want.<br/>
<br/>
The only animals you SHOULD NOT kill due to faction hits are the bears<br/>
inside the city of Sure Fall Glades.<br/>
<br/>
If you kill animals near certain NPCs (Holly...bitch) and other rangers and<br/>
druid NPCs throughout various zones, they will assist the animal and kick<br/>
your butt.  You do not suffer a faction hit for this combat, just a corpse<br/>
retrieval.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, animals are the only way to obtain pelts and skins.  In<br/>
addition at some levels they are the only obvious choice in killing for<br/>
experience.  In addition we have four lines of spells devoted to jacking<br/>
with animals.  To me it is clear that game intends for druids to whack on<br/>
animals with no remorse.  Many people feel this is against their own sense<br/>
of role-playing a druid.  It is important to note that many monsters who we<br/>
would consider an &#39;animal&#39; are not (i.e. spider variants).   The best way to<br/>
tell is to try to cast a charm animal variant spell on them and see if you<br/>
get a message about only being able to cast on animals.<br/>
<br/>
As a player, I prefer to kill MOBs that have loot that is worth messing<br/>
with.   With the exception of ruined pelts at low levels, I have found<br/>
animals to be not worth the monetary effort (well mammoth tusks and grif<br/>
feathers are nice).<br/>
<br/>
Do as you will, but I think that you will get very little reward for NOT<br/>
killing animals and your experience on Norrath will be more difficult as<br/>
many of your spells will go unused.<br/>
<br/>
However in the sense of a druid is a protector of nature, make sure players<br/>
(and yourself) clean up all corpses so they don&#39;t lay around to decay, also<br/>
use anything you pick up of a corpse, don&#39;t just dump it on the ground.  In<br/>
my sense of role-playing, Norrath will ALWAYS spawn more monsters than<br/>
players can wipe out, so my job is to help maintain an effective balance...<br/>
