Subject: [EverQuest] Something nice for a friend<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; What is the nicest thing someone has done for you in game?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A friend of mine has been showing me the ropes of EQ and, when I get<br/>
&gt; high enough, I want to repay him for his kindness.  Looking for ideas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks all.<br/>

I was playing my (at the time) level 3 DE necro, killing vermin near the<br/>
newbie log in Nektulos, when a level 54 necro passing by asked if I had a<br/>
fire beetle eye to sell him. I gave it to him, and he gave me 200 platinum<br/>
for it. Speechless, to say the least.<br/>
<br/>
Must be nice to have so much plat you can do those kinds of things. </span></blockquote></div>
