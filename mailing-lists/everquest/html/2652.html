<div id="ygrps-yiv-178523740">Yes, lacking the agp i will go for the 4. i did see the specs and <br/>
tests and do know it is coming in at just around the top end of the 2 <br/>
in performance. since the prices are close, the 4 is good. it is a <br/>
little cheesy for them to market this way, but when have they been <br/>
any different?<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the info. I will just stick with my good ol Geforce 2 <br/>

&gt;   PC Gamer magazine, which regularly reviews hardware items that <br/>
are of interest to gamers, like video cards, said that the cheaper <br/>
GeForce 4 video cards are basically equivalent or just a little <br/>
better than the old GeForce 2 cards. The &quot;real&quot; GeForce 4 cards are <br/>
the Ti 4400 and Ti 4600, which cost about $300 and $400, <br/>
respectively. It&#39;s a marketing gimmick and somewhat underhanded, in <br/>
my opinion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   On the other hand, if you do not have an AGP slot, you will be <br/>
limited to these less expensive cards. They are not bad video cards <br/>
(I am running a GeForce 2 Ultra and it works just fine with EQ), they <br/>
are just deceptively named. <br/>

&gt;     Yeah I found out the Geforce 4 is in the low price range, <br/>
obviously the new card to get. <br/>
