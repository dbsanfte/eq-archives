<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090642590">Well Muse is selling the PDF format of his maps if you wanna use his or do<br/>
Like I do and print up all the ones he has directly from the sight  by<br/>
running your cursor over what you want printed and then setting your printer<br/>
to print the highlighted areas<br/>

&gt; Oh, the maps that came with the game were some of my biggest pet peeves.<br/>
&gt; They made no sense to me. I asked /ooc if they looked even remotely like<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; city (to people who had been exploring) and was told &quot;No&quot;. And then they<br/>
&gt; sold that map booklet that is almost useless. Especially with some of the<br/>
&gt; errors. Like having A B C D E listed on the map but only A B C D defined.<br/>
So<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s this zone that&#39;s marked but not defined... The person who did EQ<br/>
&gt; Atlas did a MUCH better job at maps. His maps are much much more useful. I<br/>
&gt; really wish he hadn&#39;t gotten screwed on the map book thingy. I would&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; payed for a book with his maps over the one Sony put out. I still think it<br/>
&gt; would be cool if he made a book and had fold out maps and such. Ones that<br/>
&gt; are large enough to mark things on as notes to yourself. So you can look<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; them ingame and out of game.<br/>
