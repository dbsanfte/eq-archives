<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973644241">I met my BF at FanFaire. My main is a 54 druid and his main is a 60 druid<br/>
but on different servers. I decided to start a newb char on his server<br/>
because I wanted to play something different and I can still keep in touch<br/>
with my friends thru an interserver chat room. Just wondering what I should<br/>
get to start the mage out. I so dont feel like doing the newb armor quests<br/>
hehe.<br/>
Less confused about the situation Rob? LOL</div>
