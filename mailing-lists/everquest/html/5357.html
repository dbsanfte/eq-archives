<div id="ygrps-yiv-867629404">Hmm.. Good points. I think it&#39;s similar to what some would call &quot;TV<br/>
Addiction&quot;. People who sit in front of the TV and watch all day. I used to<br/>
do that. Now I play on my computer. But at least when I play on my computer<br/>
I exercise my mind more. and I type and get some movement going. I also get<br/>
to socialize. I think there are important lessons to be learned from playing<br/>
an online game. You have to learn about social things. How to interact with<br/>
others, how to operate in a group and use teamwork. And you learn what<br/>
happens when you do not work well with others. I am someone who might be<br/>
considered &quot;addicted&quot; by some because I pretty much do nothing but play EQ<br/>
or play on my computer when I&#39;m not sleeping. however, I have a heart<br/>
condition and suffer from chronic fatigue so I don&#39;t get out of the house<br/>
and do much for health reasons. I would be pretty damned bored without EQ.<br/>
Especially with the weather as cold as it is now.<br/>

You can beg all you want /grin. I don&#39;t think that it is the game that is<br/>
the problem. The problem is self-esteem for the one woman. The day you see<br/>
someone go into DTs from EQ, you can talk to me about it being an addiction.<br/>
These people play too much for other reasons (insecurity, mental problems,<br/>
withdrawal). If they were not hiding in EQ they would be hiding elsewhere.<br/>
