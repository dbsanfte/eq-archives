<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474943855"><html><div>There is a problem with this, though.&nbsp; I buffed a group of newbs at the Chessboard the other day, with SoW, Skin Like Nature, Storm Strength, and Shield of Thorns (this was because my guild leader was playing his alt in the group and said they were clueless and could use the help :)</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>After I left them, I was in Halas and got a /tell from the wizard in the group (not my guild leader) chewing me out because their buffs wore off and they died.&nbsp; So newbies can get *too* dependent on those buffs, especially at levels 1 - 5.&nbsp; They start to expect fast leveling and no damage, and are surprised when an orc pawn flattens them.&nbsp; Just my observations (although I still buff).</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>BTW, I hit 50 on Monday.&nbsp; WOOOT!</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>~Nymue~</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote style="BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;"> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;">----- Original Message -----</div> <div style="BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;COLOR:black;FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>From:</b> Su</div> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, May 30, 2001 12:05 PM</div> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>To:</b> EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</div> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Unspoken agreements</div> <div>&nbsp;</div>I like to take my lvl 26 cleric to orc lift and just buff and heal everyone<br>in sight. I also offer binds. Then I run to CB entrance and do the same. I<br>actually had one guy who got mad at me bc he didn&#39;t want to be buffed.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>&gt; I&#39;ve found that since I attained Breeze, whenever I need SoW (somehow I<br>&gt; often find myself having to run 1/2 way or even clear across the continent<br>&gt; to help out a guildmate) all I need do is find a medding Druid.&nbsp; I&#39;ll<br>Breeze<br>&gt; him and 9 times out of 10 they&#39;ll stand and SoW me, no questions asked.<br>For<br>&gt; that matter, unless I&#39;m in a huge hurry, I usually breeze/buff people I<br>pass<br>&gt; in my travels.&nbsp; I figure what goes around, comes around.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I will generally ask for a sow in /ooc or /shout (shout only if really<br>&gt; &gt; really desperate-- with an offer to donate).<br>&gt; &gt; But I don&#39;t go looking for a specific person. I&#39;ll just ask &quot;Can anyone<br>&gt; cast<br>&gt; &gt; sow?&quot; If someone says yes I ask them politely. If they say they don&#39;t<br>have<br>&gt; &gt; mana or are too busy I say &quot;Ok, thanks anyways&quot;.<br>&gt; &gt; luv,<br>&gt; &gt; -Su<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Illusion Spirit Wolf is fun too.&nbsp; &quot;Can you SoW me?&quot;&nbsp; Then when you<br>tell<br>&gt; &gt; them<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; sorry you cant you will begin to see the true colors of some people<br>when<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; they skip asking or explaining why they thought you could and go right<br>&gt; to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; cursing and spaming you.&nbsp; Quite funny, but can raise the old blood<br>&gt; &gt; pressure<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; a bit if you dont take it in stride.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mu<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; From: LeSamLam@...

People in Kelethin are friendlier. Heh.<br>&gt; &gt; looking<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; like PP is funny. :-)<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; That reminds me, isn&#39;t the game supposed to ask you if you want to<br>drop<br>&gt; &gt; your<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; money when you are clicking it over something? Bc I tried to trade<br>money<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; with someone once and it didn&#39;t trade but the money was gone. The<br>person<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; informed me that I had dropped it on the ground. I had not meant to<br>drop<br>&gt; &gt; it<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; and it didn&#39;t ask me if I wanted to..
