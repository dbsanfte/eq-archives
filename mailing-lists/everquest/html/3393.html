<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-613974202">Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place to hunt to<br/>
get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>
Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the other<br/>
parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is there..<br/>
does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I will<br/>
hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to zone<br/>
beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the higher<br/>
lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
luv,<br/>
