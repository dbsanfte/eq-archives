<br>everyone conned at least dubious to me. I went into Seafarer&#39;s roost and
<br>made sure to con everyone. Nobody was KOS. Most were apprehensive to
<br>indifferent. I went to buy from a merchant. As soon as I finished the
<br>transaction something started hitting me. I turned around and couldnt&#39; see
<br>it anywhere. I ran from the building and soon I was dead. Even looking down
<br>at my corpse, whatever attacked me was not visible. I scrolled back up to
<br>see what I had done to piss it off. All the thing said before attacking me
<br>was &quot;How dare you!&quot; &nbsp;It didn&#39;t say anything about me being a dark elf or
<br>whatnot. I petitioned and the GM said that it probably attacked me thru the
<br>wall and promised to get back to me later after she looked into it. She
<br>never did. :-(
<br>The worst part was, I lost my level.. and I still haven&#39;t gotten back after
<br>a week. I lost 3 blue bubbles of xp. :-(
<br>What do you folks think? Should I repetion?
