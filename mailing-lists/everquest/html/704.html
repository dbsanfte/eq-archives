As to your rant :) ( of course on my post.. hehe )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What solutions do you have?  What ideas do you have? I&#39;m sure we would all<br/>
like to listen to a few suggestions. You can&#39;t be a lone ranger and submit<br/>
them yourself and expect changes to occur.. We all need to work together,<br/>
unfortunately I here a lot of complaining yet no set forth solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Hint us in on a few, we might just agree.<br/>
<br/>
(and this is in no way a flame)<br/>

&gt;Personally i dont mind the changes they are making.. i feel that they are<br/>
&gt;putting new life into the game that was dying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Give examples of what issues you have.. maybe others here will discuss <br/>
&gt;them.<br/>
&gt;Pros and cons like.  I believe the classes are pretty much balanced, each<br/>
&gt;one needs time to develop.  Most classes that seem weak in the early levels<br/>
&gt;(ie &lt;25 ) show true strength later on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh well, what does everyone else think.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please keep in mind, that I merely am stating my beliefs/opinion. <br/>
Unfortunately postings such as this tend to have an adverse effect - and <br/>
flame wars usually ensue. This is not my intent. With that having been said,<br/>
<br/>
onward I must rant.<br/>
<br/>
/rant on<br/>
<br/>
It is my belief that EQ could be so much more than it is. I find myself with<br/>
<br/>
many ideas that could be used to help strengthen EQ, and Verant chooses to <br/>
ignore those suggestions even though they&#39;re easily implementable. I don&#39;t <br/>
claim to have all the answers, nor do I claim that by implementing my <br/>
suggestions that EQ will be totally fixed. But when will Verant take note <br/>
and start listening to their customers? For the most part, they&#39;d rather <br/>
ignore us than listen. I find this highly disturbing. Is it be just one <br/>
players problem/suggestion, if we&#39;re all complaining about it, or suggesting<br/>
<br/>
it? (It being whatever problem/issue/idea is at hand) And why can&#39;t they <br/>
give good customer support? Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve had some very good <br/>
support from GM&#39;s and Guides, but unfortunately, I&#39;ve had way more bad <br/>
encounters than good ones. Overall, it&#39;s leaving me rather unsatisfied for <br/>
my $10 a month.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, instead using their resources on fixing problems, Verant would <br/>
rather rave on and on about a player run economy that&#39;s practically non <br/>
existent. They point to the trade skills and say &quot;There&#39;s your answer!&quot; <br/>
Truthfully, what real use are the trade skills? For that matter, how come <br/>
the trade skills don&#39;t make much sense? One point in case - mechanical <br/>
lockpicks - rat ears are part of the recipe. Does that make sense? Not <br/>
really. Can I live with it? Yes. But when something as simple as the recipe <br/>
for the Telescoping fishing pole can&#39;t be figured out because of the &quot;lack <br/>
of sense&quot; with the trade skill, wouldn&#39;t it signal to someone that maybe, <br/>
just maybe, something is wrong?<br/>
<br/>
A very good example of this is tinkering. Being part of the Tinkerer&#39;s <br/>
mailing list, I know firsthand how many people were involved with <br/>
researching the recipe, as well as how much PP went into it&#39;s discovery. I <br/>
know for a fact that correct recipe has been used many times before, and it <br/>
never worked. Now all of a sudden it does? Seems a bit fishy to me. Now try <br/>
and get a straight answer out of a GM or Guide about it. In fact, try to get<br/>
<br/>
ANY straight answer out of a GM or Guide, or even get anything from them at <br/>
all. They&#39;re usually too busy ignoring us to care.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, in spite of everything, I guess the single number one thing that <br/>
irritates me most, is the fact that I realize that EQ could and should be so<br/>
<br/>
much more. And instead of taking EQ to where it should be, I have to sit on <br/>
my butt due to lack of technical programming expertise, and watch from the <br/>
sidelines while Verant idly tweaks and nerfs everything to hell with &quot;band <br/>
aid patches&quot;, instead of just outright fixing it. That&#39;s why I&#39;m currently <br/>
looking for a new game, (excluding AC or UO) or for a programming group with<br/>
<br/>
the ability to do something high calibre like EQ but better, and that also <br/>
has the smarts to avoid the same pitfalls.<br/>
