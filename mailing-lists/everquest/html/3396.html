<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141115101">I don&#39;t think anyone on here has lashed out at Verant but I know several<br/>
have during game play, that comment was mostly meant for them. <br/>
It&#39;s a new thing so yea people are going to flock to it. I personally<br/>
haven&#39;t been there yet. I was told you need the Luclin expansion for it.<br/>
Don&#39;t have that one, heck I just picked up the Ruins expan yesterday!<br/>
Lol!<br/>
I have to admit I personally am enjoying the little amount of people in<br/>
the game, I&#39;m getting a hold of a lot of great stuff and making some<br/>
decent plat amounts. I&#39;ve been able to get all the items I need for my<br/>
quests and so forth. Today I was surprised and happy to see a few people<br/>
running around in Steamfront. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway back to my quests!<br/>

I don&#39;t think anyone has said this was Verant&#39;s fault. I think we all<br/>
realize that anytime you have a large number of people someplace it is<br/>
going<br/>
to zone. It is kindof amazing to realize that there are 200+ people in<br/>
one<br/>
zone though. I don&#39;t think people expected to see that many in one zone.<br/>
Hopefully the lag will die down some as the novelty of the new features<br/>
start to fade. Who knows though, maybe they might have to make a<br/>
bazaar2.<br/>
Until then, some of us with really pathetic &#39;net connections will have<br/>
to<br/>
wait until the fervor dies down.<br/>
And nah. You&#39;re not going to get flamed. You&#39;re just stating the facts.<br/>
:-)<br/>
luv,<br/>
