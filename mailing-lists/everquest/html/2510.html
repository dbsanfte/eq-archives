<div id="ygrps-yiv-854760281"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ok..i have decided my new character will probably be<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just a quick note, make certain that your WE Druid<br/>
worships Tunare, not Karana. Karana worshippers get<br/>
access to cheap crafted WIS earrings (4wis, 2sta, some<br/>
AC and neg STR if I remeber correct) but followers of<br/>
Tunare get access to an easy quest that provides a<br/>
necklace with unlimited charges of the lowest level<br/>
root spell. (clickable effect, very sweet)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, for someone just getting used to the game, as<br/>
much fun as it can be to stray a little, the obvious<br/>
path is usually the best bet. For the first ten levels<br/>
or so it doesn&#39;t really matter where you start, GFay<br/>
is fine, most of my characters grew up there. There&#39;s<br/>
a lot of idiots to deal with, but it&#39;s good practice<br/>
for zones like LOIO and Unrest later. ;) Aside from<br/>
that i&#39;ve grown to quite like the Commonlands.<br/>
Catching a TP to WC and running to Freeport is pretty<br/>
easily done, in EC/WC you&#39;ll be hunting bears and<br/>
spiders. Both of which drop tailoring components that<br/>
sell relatively well. (Hiqh Quality Bear Skins sell<br/>
for 30pp, and stacks of 20 Spider Silks about 15pp)<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s the basics for you. For the first few levels,<br/>
you&#39;ll mostly just run around and whack bugs with a<br/>
club. Try to raise your One Hand Blunt and One Hand<br/>
Slashing skills (using scimitars for the latter). It&#39;s<br/>
a very long term consideration, but if you ever do<br/>
reach lvl 50+, you&#39;ll want to quest for your Epic, a<br/>
scimitar.<br/>
<br/>
Once you start getting a little more mana to work with<br/>
and a few more spells, you can start practicing a<br/>
technique called Kiting. (you can start doing it<br/>
really effectively as soon as you can cast Spirit of<br/>
the Wolf) Kiting is casting Snare on a single monster,<br/>
having SoW on yourself already, then running away a<br/>
distance, cast a DD spell, run a little more, cast a<br/>
spell, repeat until the monster is dead. Ideally you<br/>
want to keep the MOB at the very edge of your casting<br/>
range, at very least far enough that they can&#39;t hit<br/>
you. Using that technique you can kill yellows and<br/>
even in some cases monsters that barely con red. (do<br/>
your research on eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com before you<br/>
even DREAM of attacking a red conning monster)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; :-P...i want to do this on my own and have no idea<br/>
&gt; where to start...Do i just jump out there and start<br/>
&gt; killing critters or run around and hope i can find<br/>
&gt; my way back from wherever i leave??  i know i sound<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very early on (lvl 4 if memory serves) you get a spell<br/>
called Gate. Once you have that, you can always<br/>
teleport back to where you&#39;re bound. (the spot where<br/>
you go to when you die) If you&#39;re a Wood Elf, that<br/>
will be near Newbie Lift in Kelethin, if you travel to<br/>
Freeport try to get a bind near the Eastern Gate.<br/>
(pretty common request) Once you get your next round<br/>
of spells (again memory is foggy but I believe level<br/>
9) you get a spell called Bind Affinity, which allows<br/>
you to change your bind point to wherever you&#39;re<br/>
standing. It&#39;s your best friend to keep from getting<br/>
lost, you can just wander at random and gate back to<br/>
safety whenever you need. Plus Gate is your panic<br/>
button, when you see MOBs you can&#39;t handle, you can<br/>
always run away a bit and gate. (preferably with snare<br/>
on them and SoW on you to buy a bit more time)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; foolish but it is really important to do this on my<br/>
&gt; own..how else can one really learn??  Help is great<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Read. Constantly. Try these sites:<br/>
<br/>
allakhazam.com<br/>
eqvault.ign.com<br/>
eq.castersrealm.com<br/>
eqatlas.com<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of other sites, those are the best<br/>
ones i&#39;ve come across though. (thesafehouse.org is<br/>
amazing for rogues, but not a lot of general<br/>
information there)<br/>
<br/>
If you want to travel to a new zone, do a little<br/>
research. EQ Atlas is great for that, you can get a<br/>
map of any zone in the game, and there&#39;s a link to<br/>
allakhazam.com&#39;s beastiary, so you can find out what<br/>
mobs you will find there and what to avoid.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and i really do appreciate it but i also want to<br/>
&gt;feel like i have accomplished something<br/>
&gt;personally...Does that make sense...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Totally, got several friends who were in similar<br/>
positions. I just hope your BF isn&#39;t the controlling<br/>
type. :/ Seen a few nasty situations where BF&#39;s start<br/>
getting jealous of their GF&#39;s achievements...<br/>
