<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971223219">Yeah, this guy wouldn&#39;t even talk to us. He didn&#39;t respond to anything<br/>
anyone said at all (except for the one time he claimed he only looted one<br/>
corpse). He would pull stuff when we weren&#39;t ready. It was like he wanted to<br/>
solo but couldn&#39;t kill stuff on his own. So he acted like he was solo by not<br/>
speaking to anyone and hogging all the loot.<br/>
Another time I was helping to PL my brother who was in a group. I was<br/>
sitting on the sidelines. A new guy joined his group and then went and sat<br/>
in the orc camp. They kept telling him to get out of the camp so his pet<br/>
wouldn&#39;t aggro on all of the orcs. One of the group members sent me a tell<br/>
saying &quot;That pet is going to get us killed&quot;. He kept getting the whole camp<br/>
in them. So I had to start rooting and nuking to save them. I soon ran out<br/>
of mana. The guy with the pet (a lvl 12 mage) was saying he could probably<br/>
solo the camp even though people were helping him. He wanted to take on<br/>
Legos. Group leard told him &quot;No.&quot; that the Legos were for me. Part of the<br/>
deal was I was buffing them and helping them and in return I got the few<br/>
legos that spawned (bc they were the only things that gave me xp). The guy<br/>
objected. He wanted the Legos. They said No. I told him I was there first--<br/>
before any of them had come along. I also watched the guy loot 5 corpses in<br/>
a row and loot while they were fighting. He would sit back and do nothing<br/>
while they fought, and then run up and loot. I told the group leader. He<br/>
told the guy to stop hogging loot. One of the group members told me to let<br/>
her know if the jerk tried to KS me. After the guy kept arguing that he had<br/>
more of a right to kill Legos the guy left the group, claiming he didn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;need&quot; them. So he went and sat in the camp, to make sure he could KS. I<br/>
told my bro &quot;If he thinks he can solo this camp, just let him try. tell your<br/>
group not to help him. Let him find out if he really does need other people<br/>
ore not&quot;. So he gets aggrod by two cents. Then an oracle comes along. Bc<br/>
he&#39;s standing inside the camp, all the new pops come over and aggro. His pet<br/>
dies and he runs to us. We all move out of the way and ignore him. He dies.<br/>
The orcs go back to their camp,where I proceed to pull one at a time for the<br/>
group to kill. My brother dances on the jerk&#39;s corpse. It was quite amusing.<br/>
luv,<br/>
