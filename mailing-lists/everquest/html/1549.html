    It seems to me that the only problem with twinking is that EQ has become<br/>
a<br/>
    game about killing, levelling, and looting.  If it were truly a<br/>
roleplaying<br/>
    game, this would not even be an issue.  If your main drive in the game<br/>
is<br/>
    to get the bigger and better item (whatever it may be), you will always<br/>
    have low level players trying to be twinked and you will always have<br/>
    jealous &quot;un-twinked&quot; players.  But when did the term &quot;roleplaying game&quot;<br/>
    turn into &quot;hack and loot&quot;? </span></blockquote></div>
