<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117656301">From what I have experienced with mY Sk when he was lvl <br/>
40 on up I hunted in groups in Rm against teh Hg and <br/>
sinceluclin ave managed toget into a group  in <br/>
DawnShroud.  Also my guild went on several xp raids <br/>
toplaceslike The Hole and Sol B.  I&#39;ve never beenon a <br/>
Dragon Raid but I understand if you wanna hunt Lady Vox <br/>
in Permafrost you cannot be anyhigher than 52 otherwise <br/>
you get booted to Everfrost if you get within agro range <br/>
of her.<br/>
<br/>
now if you happen to be in your 3o&#39;s huntingin the <br/>
Overthere until about 40 or 42  gves you good xp.  By <br/>
the time you getto 40 or 41 you should be able to solo a <br/>
good majority of the mobs taht hang out near skyfire and <br/>
the ledge in OT.  One thing though if you do go to <br/>
Soloing in OT try to stay away fromt he kity cats as <br/>
they tend to be more than the DBlue con ex giving oyu <br/>
more trouble than they are worth for the xp.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2cp worth on that<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; That is something I have wondered about myself, a good place to hunt in the <br/>
&gt; 40&#39;s. I am in the Dreadlands at 42 and I like it alright because there are <br/>
&gt; people there going on dragon raids and one of my goals is to go on a dragon raid <br/>
&gt; someday. </span></blockquote></div>
