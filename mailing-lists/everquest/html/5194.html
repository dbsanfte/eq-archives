<div id="ygrps-yiv-976742799">Stick to using www.WTFcomics.com as they frequently change servers,<br/>
the IP address changes but the domain follows them wherever they roam.<br/>
Also, www.mobhunter.com has comics as well as interesting and humorous<br/>
articles.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; One day while sitting in class ignoring my professor&#39;s lecture, I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was browsing the web and came across a weblink.  It was a series of<br/>
comic strips based on EverQuest that I thought was really well done. <br/>
I had intended on posting the link to this list, but never did.  Now<br/>
I&#39;m trying to find the link again but I cant remember how or where I<br/>
found it.  So I was hoping that maybe someone here might know what I&#39;m<br/>
talking about.  Essentially the comic strip starts out with a female<br/>
wood elf turning in her quest paper to become a druid, but some things<br/>
happen and she ends up being taken under the wing (?) of an Iksar who<br/>
was a friend of her father.  The Iksar character is named after the<br/>
person&#39;s character who draws the strip.  Hopefully this is enough<br/>
information that someone might recognize it and post the link.  <br/>
