<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783659027">AA points = Alternate Advancement.<br/>
You can channel your xp into giving you alternate advancement points which<br/>
you can spend on high level skills (such as increased runspeed, strength,<br/>
charisma, etc). You can only start getting points after you get lvl 51 I<br/>
think.<br/>
