<div id="ygrps-yiv-726768185">First off, be a Iksar monk, they beat the humans in every way, apart from<br/>
the XP requirment...<br/>
Secondly, don&#39;t go overweight, it&#39;s not too critical in the early levels,<br/>
but you will take a AC<br/>
hit if you go over 14 points in weight.<br/>
As you gain levels the amount you can carry does go up, but I&#39;m not sure<br/>
when or by how much.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] New Character<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any of you familiar with using a Monk?  Cuz I haven&#39;t.  I&#39;m a total<br/>
newbie with a monk.  Never used one, don&#39;t know how I should start<br/>
with a monk.  Any of you monk amateurs or experts want to give me<br/>
some suggestions how I should start my monk on character creation and<br/>
onward?  That&#39;ll be great.  And for those who are on Druzzil Ro, you<br/>
can help me out too because that&#39;s where I&#39;m gonna be making my<br/>
character.  I don&#39;t know what my character name is gonna be yet but<br/>
if you guys want to chat, meet me, or help me on druzzil ro, I would<br/>
love to know what your character names are.  Now here&#39;s a question,<br/>
Should I be a human monk or an iksar monk?  I know there are only two<br/>
races you can be for a monk.  Anyway, there I am.  Plus the other<br/>
reason for making this character is to meet somoene who is going to<br/>
be married which I met on Vazaelle.  So she asked if I could go to<br/>
her wedding.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m making this character but since I&#39;m<br/>
gonna make a character to meet her, might as well use that character<br/>
in good use.  I was gonna make a new character anyway on a different<br/>
server that has better economy than Vazaelle.  Anyway, I would<br/>
appreciate the help you guys can give me.<br/>
