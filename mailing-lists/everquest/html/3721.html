<div id="ygrps-yiv-756863112">What has been described is a military opperation with military <br/>
discipline. Can&#39;t really do raids any other way.<br/>
<br/>
Instilling that discipline is the hard part. All players will have to <br/>
be willing to accept orders and follow them exactly.<br/>

&gt; &gt; ********NEED HELP********** <br/>
&gt; &gt;      I need help from any of you High End gamers.  My <br/>
&gt; guild is quickly growing,  and starting to do Higher <br/>
&gt; level raids.  Many of our members have not had much <br/>
&gt; experience raiding, so we have been doing &quot;training&quot; <br/>
&gt; raids.  We are still having people not listening, and <br/>
&gt; ending up causing TPW&#39;s.  If any of you have any Guids <br/>
&gt; to raiding,  and/or rules that your guild has,  please <br/>
&gt; send them to me so I can design something tailored to my <br/>
&gt; guild.<br/>
&gt; -----------------------------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It would help a bit knowing what you are trying to raid <br/>
&gt; and what rules you have nw to begin with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First off, it helps to have clearly defined goals and <br/>
&gt; loot rules for each raid you are going to do.  There is <br/>
&gt; nothing more frustrating than going on a raid with a <br/>
&gt; group that doesn&#39;t know what they are doing or doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; look like they know what they are doing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s also important to have a raid channel set up for <br/>
&gt; just the Raid Leader, officers, and any group leaders.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s also important that you stress that raiding ISN&#39;T <br/>
&gt; about getting XP, it&#39;s about accomplishing a goal <br/>
&gt; (whether that is killing one single mob, farming for <br/>
&gt; armor and weapons, etc..)  No one should expect to get <br/>
&gt; any XP during a raid (in fact, some people should expect <br/>
&gt; to lose it) and groups shouldn&#39;t be created to allow <br/>
&gt; people to get XP (I lost a full yellow of XP on my first <br/>
&gt; Fear raid after we had trouble breaking the zone).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the actual fighting, NOONE should attack any mob <br/>
&gt; until your Main Tank calls for an assist.  Make sure you <br/>
&gt; MT has a very clear assist call.  This is probably the <br/>
&gt; single most important point you can stress on any raid.  <br/>
&gt; The MT should be the only person that shouold be taking <br/>
&gt; any direct damage from the mobs on the raid (except for <br/>
&gt; enc while they are mezzing or charming any adds)....that <br/>
&gt; includes casters too.  The only exceptions would be <br/>
&gt; shammys and enc debuffing and slowing the mobs while the <br/>
&gt; MT is gaining aggro (and even then, it&#39;s the RL call <br/>
&gt; when those groups should be doing their stuff.....you <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want a mob &quot;ping ponging&quot; between those casters <br/>
&gt; while the MT is getting aggro).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The biggest reason why raids fail is people not <br/>
&gt; listening.  One person can kill a raid very quickly.  <br/>
&gt; People need to have defined roles on a raid and know <br/>
&gt; when to use them.  And the RL needs to tell each player <br/>
&gt; what is role is.  Dont expect people to know what you <br/>
&gt; want them to do, tell them.<br/>
