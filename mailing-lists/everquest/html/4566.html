If there is no PVP on the PS2 version then you got waxed by an NPC.&nbsp; And 
assuming the PS2 version remains true to the computer game, Freeport initself is 
not an inherently evil town.&nbsp; Freeport is just having internal 
problems.&nbsp; The Freeport Militia in West Freeport are against the Knights Of 
Truth in North Freeport.&nbsp; And quite frankly, neither group tolerates dark 
elves.&nbsp; Dark elves who are allowed in Freeport have worked hard to make it 
so by killing off orcs and turning in belts and shoulder pads for faction.&nbsp; 
If you&#39;re a low level dark elf then no amount of dueling would have saved you 
cause if anyone canc ome up and beat you down ont he spot like that, you 
couldn&#39;t beat them anyway.&nbsp; So stick to Neriak until you raise your faction 
to at least apprehensive. Then go to Freeport.</font></div>

towns and you&#39;ll be ok.&nbsp; EQOA has no plans to include PVP as far as I know. 
There are lots of places Dark Elves are welcome, have you been to Freeport 
yet?&nbsp; That town is an evil town, still seems strange to see Trolls walking 
around Freeport.&nbsp; Have fun.<br><br><br></font></div></html></div>
