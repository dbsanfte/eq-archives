<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921615348">Welcome to the game. You are already way ahead having someone in your <br/>
life also sharing your virtual life. In that way you can play without <br/>
neglecting someone, but infact bond with them in a very special way.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, I am on the Zeb server, so our hails will have to be here. <br/>
This is a good list, and much fellowship and advice shall be found <br/>
here. It is a little slow here right now, but has it&#39;s busy periods.<br/>
<br/>
I am a halfling druid as my primary. Lvl 30. I am also a halfling <br/>
warrior, lvl 8, and a gnome magician, lvl 3. I have worked my primary <br/>
most of the time, but now am attending a bit more to my alts.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to ask questions here. This is a great place to share <br/>
adventures, get advice, and share what you have learned.<br/>

&gt; I am really new at the game (have been playing only about a <br/>
&gt; month)...i am on the Ayonae Ro server with a couple of characters <br/>
&gt; (lvl 9 Barb Warrior and lvl 5 Cleric...told you I was new...LOL) <br/>
Was <br/>
&gt; just curious if anyone else in on that server...usually am hunting <br/>
&gt; with the love of my life who is teaching me the game but would be <br/>
fun <br/>
&gt; to pass a friendly &quot;Hail&quot; to those here on the list should our <br/>
paths <br/>
&gt; cross...would that be proper and acceptable EQ etiquette??  Just <br/>
&gt; curious  :-)<br/>
