<br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote TYPE="CITE" style="BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;">I had someone come up to me and start begging me to summon cold stones for
<br>them. They started shouting &quot;would someone summon me a cold stone&quot;. After
<br>about 10 minutes I shouted back &quot;NO.&quot;
<br>The person sent me a tell and said &quot;why not?&quot; I said it was bc #1 I didn&#39;t
<br>even know what cold stones were and #2 I didn&#39;t have a spell to summon them.
<br>When they asked me to buy the spell I told them that my class didn&#39;t get
<br>that spell.
<br>Some people..
