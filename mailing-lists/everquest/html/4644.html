<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674877895">I was curious what has changed about the languages.  I used to be able to teach a language to my group and get better at it.  This is no longer so, and I talked to a GM who told me this was never so.  I was also told that something changed in respect to languages and zoning or something.  I am quite curious about this, as I am trying to learn every language I can.  I was also curious if you could teach over your own knowledge in the language.  Thank you in advance for your replies.<br/>
