<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431575444">Hi Carey<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a high elf chanty too, but she&#39;s only 32 - she&#39;ll get up <br/>
there one day though :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had awful issues with loot as well both in the dungeons and out <br/>
of it. I know that having one main looter is probably the easiest, <br/>
but sheesh, when they log (and i think some of them just disconnect <br/>
when they&#39;ve had enough without splitting) without splitting it can <br/>
get really hard.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;ll all learn the perfect loot method some day.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
T<br/>

&gt; Hello all!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just thought I would introduce myself. My name is<br/>
&gt; Cary. I&#39;m 25 years old married. Both my husband and I<br/>
&gt; play EQ. He is the one that got me hooked. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My Characters:<br/>
&gt; Venetia Valgrave - Lvl 43 Ench High elf - Currently<br/>
&gt; gaining exp to dungeon groups and not liking it<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clawdya Valgrave Lvl 23 - Beastlord Kitty - Currently<br/>
&gt; in PC<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I play on the the Tarew Marr server with my husband<br/>
&gt; Morrdak Valgrave who is a lvl 52 Iksar SK. Also a<br/>
&gt; bunch of My RL friends play on that server. We all<br/>
&gt; have the family name of Valgrave. Its pretty funny.<br/>
&gt; Hehe<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to level to 46 as quickly as possible so I<br/>
&gt; can level in POJ with my friends who are in their 50&#39;s<br/>
&gt; now. It sucks not being able to level with them. The<br/>
&gt; Dungeon groups suck because everybody is sooo rude and<br/>
&gt; I have been jipped out of split 4 times now. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I just thought I would introduce myself! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cary<br/>
