<div id="ygrps-yiv-993366178">Anyone else using a wireless mouse? My son installed one on our <br/>
computer. I have mixed feelings. When it is good it is very, very <br/>
good. When it is bad, it sucks.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, it is nice to be free of wires. This one is radio, <br/>
not infra-red. Not bad, until it runs out of juice when you are doing <br/>
something important. Don&#39;t forget to put it in it&#39;s docking station <br/>
to recharge.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t put it in the docking station with care, it calls up a <br/>
help window. That is a pain, since the screen saver and monitor shut <br/>
off don&#39;t seem to want to work while the help window is open. A <br/>
little care prevents this, but what a pain.<br/>
<br/>
The up side is that you can re-arrange your gaming hardware <br/>
configuration to suit your tastes without worrying about the mouse <br/>
cable. This wireless stuff may be rather nice once the bugs are <br/>
worked out.<br/>
