<b>Subject:</b> Undocumented Everfrost Location <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054449753">Has anyone been to the hidden cave area located in Everfrost.� You have to<br/>
swim under the ice to get to it ( you must have atleast the skill of 75 in<br/>
swimming�or Endure Beathing make it).� None of the maps that ive seen,<br/>
include this area.� I&#39;ve traveled there before and i found� the maze�to be<br/>
mostly empty, shy a few ice boned skeletons.� There was a named human<br/>
necromancer there, but�i have since forgotten his name.� I cannot verfiy<br/>
that the cave was empty after that, for i didn&#39;t explore beyond the Necro.�<br/>
I do believe that the cave extended further; though, i cannot verfiy.� There<br/>
was also a small portal like structure that was guarded by two ice bones.�<br/>
If you step inside you are turned back around, (like the skeleton cave in<br/>
the Tox Forest, which will soon lead to the future�Paineel zone) i asume<br/>
that this aswell will be a future zone point.� <br/>
�<br/>
I will check it out again and report in.� Check it out, who knows what<br/>
purpose or loot the necro might contain.� Maybe hes guarding something<br/>
else..<br/>
