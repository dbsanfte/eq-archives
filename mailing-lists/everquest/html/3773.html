Subject: [EverQuest] I rock!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; w00t! I rock! Last night I was playing my Gnome Warrior Genmay, I had just<br/>
hit lvl13, got my dual weild skill, and was hunting Minos in Ak&#39;Anon. Well I<br/>
go in and pull what I think is just one out of the cave but in all reality<br/>
is actually four slavers! I change to one of the wide views and realize my<br/>
delima. Figuring that I would probably die before I got to the guard and<br/>
even then he wouldn&#39;t be much help I decide to pull up my boots and lay into<br/>
them and at least try to do as much damage as possible. I changed from my<br/>
two Mino battle axes to my Graoning Mace to give me a little better chance<br/>
of taking at least one, maybe two slavers out before I die. So far i&#39;m doing<br/>
pretty good! I&#39;ve killed one and really wailing on another when I get<br/>
attacked by a stupid giant infected rat! &quot;Oh great!&quot; I thought figuring my<br/>
fate was sealed. I ignore the rat and keep wailing on the Minos. Luckily<br/>
somone was nice enough to come by and kill the rat for me. By this time I<br/>
was down to one bub!<br/>
&gt; ble of life left and still two Minos to go. I finish off the one I&#39;ve been<br/>
working on and go right after the last one. &quot;I&#39;m dead so I might as well die<br/>
with my boots on!&quot; I thought, Well suddenly the mino takes off and starts<br/>
running away! &quot;Holy cow! I might make this!&quot; I take off after him and<br/>
finally kill him.<br/>
&gt; So now I&#39;m standing there with a smidgen of a bubble left for life, 4 dead<br/>
mino slavers and a giant diseased rat at my feet. &quot;I have just taken out 4<br/>
mino slavers!  RRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&quot; I yell. That felt so good!<br/>
