<div id="ygrps-yiv-150068123">Could someone please let me know where I should put my extra points <br/>
for my wood elf ranger that i&#39;m creating. I&#39;ve read tons of guides <br/>
and just about everything there is to know about the ranger class, <br/>
but now I wanna hear it from some people that have actually played <br/>
one before.<br/>
<br/>
