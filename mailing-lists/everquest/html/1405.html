&gt; But the npc acted like I attacked when I didn&#39;t.. That&#39;s why it puzzles me<br/>

&gt; Oh well, at least I got my lvl back after 3 days of killing stuff.<br/>

The yahoo web side thingie won&#39;t let me subscribe to Whispers of<br/>
the palantir. I found the WhisperPalantir and clicked join group.<br/>
Voila, a new subscription to EQ!<br/>
<br/>
I really, really dislike this fickle yahoo! Why isn&#39;t it bankrupt?!?<br/>
<br/>
Get me off please! With sugar on top!<br/>
