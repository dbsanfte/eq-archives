<div id="ygrps-yiv-984171166"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; While EW can be soloed, you have to be very careful of dervishes and<br/>
&gt; giants.  First off, even at level 55+ dervishes will be much lower<br/>
&gt; in level but can still hurt you plenty.  The hit hard, and can<br/>
&gt; quikcly gang up if there is more than one in the area.  The second<br/>
&gt; danger is the giants that roam.  While these guys are easily<br/>
&gt; quelmed, they also hit hard and can gang up.  If you are fighting<br/>
&gt; one of these and a dervish or two join in... well you better be a<br/>
&gt; tank with massive HP, be a necro with a pet, or have an extra pair<br/>
&gt; of shoes in the bank because you are going to be on a CR soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. and going LD in the middle of EW while fighting snow cougars and<br/>
getting dervish adds REALLY bites.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, EW has one additional danger that many people do not think<br/>
&gt; about.  If you are fighting near the Kael ramp you don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; linger.  Hanging around the Kael ramp too long spawns the Death<br/>
&gt; Squad and these things will tear through anything that is not on<br/>
&gt; their faction.  Just a heads up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. Hence the reason why I think people should hunt near IC bridge and well<br/>
aways from Kael. :-)<br/>
Although the DeathSquad was fun to outrun while autofollowing in a group.<br/>
lol.<br/>
