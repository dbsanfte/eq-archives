<div id="ygrps-yiv-508538742">A correction and an addition, you can give him the PP instead of gold I did<br/>
it.  The ancient Cyclops in South Ro is really hard to camp for a few<br/>
reasons. He can spawn in different places.  The zone if full of people<br/>
passing through and for the reason listed before this its hard to claim the<br/>
camp.  Druid ports in sees it on track and kills it, this  might happen<br/>
without you even know he spawned. But the main reason is just way too much<br/>
traffic here.  The spawn in Ocean of Tears is much easier to camp.  He<br/>
spawns in a set position and a mob spawns there every 6 or 7 minutes ??<br/>
something like that its been a while.  The spawn could be a regular Cyclops,<br/>
a goblin, a pirate hmmm what else, anyone know? Of course the Ancient<br/>
Cyclops as well.  If you are really serious about camping the ring go to<br/>
Ocean of Tears much better place to camp it.  The only downside is that the<br/>
one in Ocean of Tears seems to be a bit harder to kill.<br/>

Talk to Hasten Bootstrutter who can be found in the Rathe Mountains. He has<br/>
an extra pair of Journeyman Boots, but would rather trade than sell it. You<br/>
must seek out the following items and hand them to him. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*	Shadowed Rapier <br/>
<br/>
*	Ring of the Ancients <br/>
<br/>
*	3250 Gold <br/>
<br/>
The shadowed rapier can be found all around Norrath dropped by those Shadow<br/>
Men. I suggest getting this piece last since it will disapear from your<br/>
inventory when you camp. For the Ring of the Ancients, it spawns on an<br/>
Ancient Cyclops in South Ro. Also make sure you hand him 3250 Gold and not<br/>
325 Platinum as this will not work. <br/>
<br/>
These boots do not have to be worn to be activated. Just right click on them<br/>
and they will bestow great speed to the user, almost like the Spirit of the<br/>
Wolf spell.<br/>

I thought JBoots did not proc until a certain level? I assume the trick to<br/>
getting them requires multiquesting with a higher level? <br/>

If you have Jboots you can kill dwarfs in BB, they are lvl 35 but if you<br/>
have boots you can kite them until fear sticks, ideally you should be around<br/>
lvl 36 I would imagine for melee b/c they do hit hard and fast 9x double and<br/>
triple but fast 6 minute spawns, if you can darkness and fear you shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have much problem killing them not sure if your spells will stick or not<br/>
dont have a SK.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Try Overthere as well, fear works nice in several spots there dont even need<br/>
to waste mana with darkness, considered a bug by some however I think not.<br/>
Fear them into the wall facing the steps they wont leave from that spot as<br/>
long as a melee is beating on them from behind if you dont hit them they<br/>
will slide off and eventually, usually, down past the stairs and back to<br/>
full speed.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Very nice place to solo with an enchanter, or other classes that can fear<br/>
but not snare/darkness (are there any others? Cleric I guess maybe more dont<br/>
think so), just need to make sure you dont get hit by the mob before you get<br/>
back to where you want to fight or you will wind up fighting a mob out in<br/>
the middle of the zone and not near the safety of the wall.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Why solo though?  So many places to find groups as a Tank I would think,<br/>
Solb comes to mind not too crowded on my server any more, except for the<br/>
bugs which are always camped b/c they are so easy to kill (low hps).  Always<br/>
seems to be some Monk in there soloing bats and beetles.<br/>

Rambled long enough.<br/>

 Lance, I&#39;d agree with you...except if you look at the traffic on this list,<br/>
it mainly is for account transactions. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So change it - bring up a topic. What shall we discuss? I&#39;d love to hear<br/>
about solid soloing spots for lv 32-35. Right now my shadow knight is<br/>
soloing effectivly in Lake of Ill Omen but am starting to hit too many<br/>
greens. But critters in FM far undercon. <br/>

I only ask that you have a little respect for those of<br/>
us who wish the channel to remain as it is.. not a<br/>
habor for the selling of your wares..  but for the<br/>
sharing of information.  <br/>
<br/>
Many have left this listserv for the very reason.  I<br/>
dont care if you wish to sell your account, however,<br/>
this is not the place for it.. thanks..<br/>

And perhaps you should stop playing police-man and<br/>
mind your own business.<br/>
Just a thought!<br/>
