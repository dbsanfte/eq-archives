<br/>
Not at all, they stated what they thought while you stated something like it<br/>
was official from VI. Stuff like that pisses me off. Stuff like that is what<br/>
starts false rumors, if you had said &quot;I think bla bla bla&quot; i wouldn&#39;t used<br/>
&quot;insults&quot;. In fact, you sounded like you knew everything about legend but<br/>
you don&#39;t.<br/>

The &#39;ALL new content&#39; line was mine.  I havent defended myself from the<br/>
insulting comments &#39;spreading my farts&#39; and &#39;spreading false shit&#39; that mr<br/>
LAINE. Mikael (Nol) accused me of.  I decided to wait until more votes were<br/>
in.  <br/>
<br/>
So mr LAINE, are you going to flame all these people of the same opinion?  <br/>
Verant have a good history of shafting its customers, and have only begun to<br/>
give us what we want in the game since October saw DAOC released and Sony<br/>
filled their pants.  Oh look!  Soulbinders!  LOL  I feel the Legend just<br/>
goes to show that this relaxing of the Nazi regime (youre in their world<br/>
now) was just superficial, as they have now shafted the community once<br/>
again.  They used finances from SoL (not to mention game improvements<br/>
promised) and some of our $10 a month to build a super server (quoted as<br/>
populated by 80% level 60s!) showing their true colors once again.<br/>
<br/>
I SERIOULSY wish my addiction would release me to stand by my principles and<br/>
quit.  Wishful thinking :)<br/>

Subject: RE: [EverQuest] Legends<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;ALL new content in Everquest will go into Legend first . . . . &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a fairly accurate statement. Any new zone or revamped zone<br/>
will go to the Legend server first to be beta tested for a bit and the<br/>
patched to the $10 a month servers. Just look at the new and revamped Cazic<br/>
Thule zone. The Legend server has this now and I&#39;m sure the VI employee that<br/>
worked this revamp is watching this zone being played on the Legend Server<br/>
and making sure everything is working as intended. One day the $10 servers<br/>
should see the new Cazic Thule.<br/>
<br/>
My feeling on the legend server is that VI stole some of my money I paid for<br/>
SoL. When I bought SoL I was under the impression I would receive some new<br/>
features with this expansion. I received some of the features, but not all<br/>
of them. So where are feature X, Y and Z? Where is my money I paid for these<br/>
features? Some of the money was spent working on the new Legends server, no<br/>
doubt about it. There is no way you could hire and train all the new GM<br/>
needed to cover the new requirements in that short of time without taking<br/>
away from the $10 paying customer before the $40 payments start rolling in.<br/>
Who was the employees revamping Cazic Thule? How many hours did it take to<br/>
complete this task? Why wasn&#39;t all those hard spent hours revamping the<br/>
Cazic Thule spent on working on things thousands of people already paid for<br/>
with SoL? None of that makes sense to me . . .  but oh well, I sure do not<br/>
loose sleep over it. <br/>
<br/>
But other than the reason above, I think the Legends idea is good for VI. It<br/>
should bring in more money for VI and that money will only make EQ a better<br/>
game, but it is just the wrong time. There will always be a market for<br/>
people to pay more and VI knows that. I know that would like some aspects of<br/>
the Legends server, but the scales do not even come close to lean the<br/>
Legends side. One of the main pluses for EQ is all the friends and guild<br/>
mates you talk to throughout your characters life. I would guess that the<br/>
cost of $480 per year and the lose of all the friends you&#39;ve made of the<br/>
years would be the main reasons lots of people would not move. <br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>
Sistily<br/>
Gnome Warlord<br/>
Tunare Server<br/>
<br/>
Tigole from the SoL site made a nice comparison:<br/>
	Legends: &quot;You can piss down my back but don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s raining.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t dwell on Legends for too long today. Yes, I could sit here and write<br/>
a novel on why Legends is a bad thing for the majority of Everquest. But I<br/>
simply don&#39;t have time. I just didn&#39;t want the opening of the new Legends<br/>
server to pass by without being able to say a quick and heart-felt, Fuck You<br/>
In the Goatass, to all involved with it. I&#39;ve heard all the arguments before<br/>
about getting what you pay for and &quot;don&#39;t go to McDonald&#39;s and expect Filet<br/>
Mignon&quot; and other such brilliant and well thought out defenses. I haven&#39;t<br/>
seen such legal spindoctoring since Johnny Cochran helped my beloved Juice<br/>
(go Trojans!) murder two people and walk away scott-free. But let&#39;s face the<br/>
facts, all of the features that were promised to us with the release of SoL<br/>
are still not here. Seems to me Legends is a pretty new service. Doesn&#39;t it<br/>
surprise anyone how fast the &quot;new&quot; Cazic Thule was revamped for the server?<br/>
Could it possibly be the jackass whose job it was to make the Bazaar work<br/>
like it was ADVERTISED was instead buffing up Lizards in CT for Daddy<br/>
Warbucks on Stormhammer? Where&#39;s my new interface? Where&#39;s my new visible<br/>
armor? Like it or not folks the people on our Poor Folk Ghetto Servers spent<br/>
money on PROMISED features which as of today do not exist. You guys still<br/>
going to run and defend the Legends losers with the old, &quot;You get what you<br/>
pay for&quot; jibberish? Guess what? We didn&#39;t get what we paid for. I went to<br/>
McDonald&#39;s expecting a goddamn Big Mac, not Filet Mignon, and you know what<br/>
I got instead? A Shit Sandwich.<br/>

	I don&#39;t think there was any whining there at all. Just statement of<br/>
fact.<br/>
	Personally I could have gone to the Legends server but figured it<br/>
would be<br/>
	full of whiney little cry babies that wanted to be cuddled and from<br/>
what I<br/>
	hear I think I was right. Lots of 50-60s wanting to kill things.<br/>
Sounds like<br/>
	every other server but with the exception that with more GMs the<br/>
whining<br/>
	will be listened to more...hehehe<br/>

	Part of the money goes to developing new stuff that is legend only<br/>
as well.<br/>
	My extra $30 bux should&#39;nt go to fixing stuff that should be fixed<br/>
anyways,<br/>
	my extra $30 should go to making my server better, not anyone<br/>
elses.. If you<br/>
	can&#39;t afford or want to move to legend then i&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s a<br/>
bit<br/>
	pathetic to whine cause some people belive it&#39;s worth paying extra<br/>
for extra<br/>
	content and a better server.<br/>

	Ämne: RE: [EverQuest] Legends<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	In theory this sounds good. But the way Verant is executing things<br/>
it isnt.<br/>
	I can understand the extra cost in personnel, that should be the<br/>
factor that<br/>
	decides price. BUT:<br/>
<br/>
	Extra zones for example without delivering the stuff promised in SoL<br/>
	expansion makes me wanna laugh. Even if the developers are on<br/>
different<br/>
	teams, thats not valid. If things are broken, things are broken,<br/>
whole<br/>
	company needs to fix things. For example Bazaar.<br/>
<br/>
	Also, the cash the legend server generates in comparison to the live<br/>
server<br/>
	is very small. (200.000 users a&#39; $10, and 8000 users a&#39; $40 ) do the<br/>
math.<br/>
	If people for example start to leave live servers the legends cash<br/>
isnt<br/>
	enough to continue to develop Everquest. So:<br/>
<br/>
	Legends price should be personnel related not zones. Dynamic (gm<br/>
involved)<br/>
	quests sure, but zone development/fixes are for the game asa whole.<br/>
Verant<br/>
	is on thin ice with this.<br/>
<br/>
	Handle the stuff promised with Luclin first dont give some mumbo<br/>
jumbo about<br/>
	different teams. If you cant handle it with current personnel, hire<br/>
more,<br/>
	work more, whatever. Solve it.<br/>

<br/>
	Wrong. Please read up before you spread your farts =P<br/>
<br/>
	The regular servers will be updated as usual, the legend servers<br/>
will<br/>
	receive legend specific content that MAY be moved to normal servers<br/>
after<br/>
	awhile. They have hired extra staff (among 19 GMs, there hsould be<br/>
gms<br/>
	working 24/7 they say) that will ONLY be working with legend so that<br/>
it<br/>
	doesn&#39;t affect the normal servers.<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;ve not been online much due to overloaded at work but it seems<br/>
fun, alot<br/>
	of nice events and good guilds. It&#39;s kinda easy to join a high-end<br/>
guild<br/>
	since about 80% of the server is level 60.<br/>
<br/>
	It all looks very good so far.<br/>
