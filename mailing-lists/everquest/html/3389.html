<div id="ygrps-yiv-467094740">Actually, my job is great for playing. I work 12 hour days, but only <br/>
three days one week and four the next, on two week pay periods. That <br/>
means I only have to work 14 days a month.<br/>
<br/>
The downside is that on work days I have time for work, eating, <br/>
commuting and sleeping, but for little else. I usually log on for <br/>
about one hour on those days and work on trade skills. Often too <br/>
tired to do even that.<br/>
<br/>
On the days off I am not babysitting my grandchildren I can have nice <br/>
long sessions. <br/>
<br/>
As for vacations, I earn vacation at a high rate and often have to <br/>
take days off just to burn the time. If I don&#39;t use it, I lose it.<br/>
<br/>
If I take one of my three day weeks off I burn only 36 hrs. and get <br/>
10 days off. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have the stamina to do 10 or 12 hr. sessions, but can do <br/>
three 3 hr. sessions a day on some days off.<br/>
<br/>
This is great, but if I retire I can play all of the time. None of <br/>
that wasted time working. After a great many years of working I can <br/>
say definitively that work sucks. Gaming is far better.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Went there this morning to set up some sales. Lag<br/>
&gt; &gt; was terrible. It <br/>
&gt; &gt; was hard to even get my cursor on target. I suppose<br/>
&gt; &gt; it will be ok <br/>
&gt; &gt; once I get set up to sell, but the set up is<br/>
&gt; &gt; terrible. Move cursor. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Not on object. Move a bit more. Not on object. Move<br/>
&gt; &gt; back. Click. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t have object. Click again. Hmph. Had object but<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t know it, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and just put it back. Click...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Took so long that I didn&#39;t finish setting up before<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had to log. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t have logged if I could have left my toon to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do business <br/>
&gt; &gt; while I was gone, but no such luck.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I just gotta get another machine, faster connection,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and retire from <br/>
&gt; &gt; my job so that I can play all the time.<br/>
