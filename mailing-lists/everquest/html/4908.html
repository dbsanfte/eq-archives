Definitely I would get rid of the corpse-hunting. I understand losing exp when you die, I think that&#39;s a good thing (well not GOOD but it makes sense) but going back to find your body to get all your stuff back just sucks. Especially when you die somewhere you can&#39;t get back to. WHY can&#39;t you ever find a necro when you need one?<br>
