<div id="ygrps-yiv-632285566">if no one went there I&#39;d doubt that 2 or 3 GM&#39;s would get much testing done.<br/>
Whenever normal servers go down, I usually head over there to see whats<br/>
going on and as they say it, take a &quot;sneak peak&quot; at what is happening.<br/>
Then after an hour or 2 I remember I was in the middle of something on<br/>
normal server and I rush over and oh! look! its back up!<br/>
its just like a spare time server thing..hehe no not even, that time should<br/>
be spent sleeping or eating or,..... something<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d tend to share Vespair opinion : I have some characters there who<br/>
&gt; are actually &quot;test&quot; characters for me. :)<br/>
&gt; But they are quite low levels and my main guys are on real servers.<br/>
&gt; Any way I love to go on the test server. When I don&#39;t have enough<br/>
&gt; time to play my bigger characters I can always ramble around with my<br/>
&gt; small test guys who are, slowly growing.<br/>
&gt; Another point is that they reset server and boot people without<br/>
&gt; warning usually, and I didn&#39;t pay for this as a permanent effect!<br/>

&gt; &gt;  This is all very well but i would not advise new players to use<br/>
&gt; the Test Server simply because Varent has said that characters<br/>
&gt; created on the test server are not immune from player wipes.  I would<br/>
&gt; not feel very well if i had worked up my player 10+ lvls and found<br/>
&gt; that one day, the character was deleted... its great for users to<br/>
&gt; spend some time there..  heck i have 3 characters on there myself..<br/>
&gt; I just wouldnt advise a newbie to start there.<br/>
