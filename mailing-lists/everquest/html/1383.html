<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512355709">Yeah! When I first started playing I was actually scared. A thunderstorm had<br/>
started and I was sitting there wide-eyed asking my sister (over the phone)<br/>
if lightning could hurt people. When I tried to follow her everything seemd<br/>
so big.. I had never played this type of game before. It was amazing...<br/>
I still get my pulse up when running from a train. :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I am rather new to the game, but one of the things that fascinates me<br/>
&gt; is the real sense of danger when I put my character in a new<br/>
&gt; situation. Heart pounds, pulse rate goes up, I even get the shakes<br/>
&gt; sometimes. I seldom get that in real life, even though I have a job<br/>
&gt; that requires occasional physical combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I love this game!<br/>

&gt; &gt; As far as I know, there&#39;s only the port to the Dreadlands.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; never been<br/>
&gt; &gt; there.  My husband went the other night and was scared to death.<br/>
&gt; He just<br/>
&gt; &gt; took off running and made it safely but how I don&#39;t know.  Just<br/>
&gt; dumb luck.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He&#39;s a 30 mage now, was 28 then and everything he passed was<br/>
&gt; conning red to<br/>
&gt; &gt; him.  He said he will stick to the boats for a while.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of porting...how can I get a port to Kunark?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not Dreadlands...but closer to Cabilis<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and without taking the barrel barge?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is there anywhere else that will get me into Kunark besides one<br/>
&gt; of the boats<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or the DL port...please<br/>
