<div id="ygrps-yiv-942444158">I have human paladin (level 6) and he suffers from the same problem the rest<br/>
of his race does.  He uses a 2 handed sword so I can&#39;t carry anything in my<br/>
hands.  I have the worn newbie candle in my pack for light.  I bought a<br/>
lantern but it did nothing in my pack.  I was looking in the bazaar and saw<br/>
lightstones, mechanical light emitters and various creature eyes.  Are any<br/>
of these a better light then my candle and can they be used from my pack?<br/>
When I look at the items it makes no mention of range or brightness.<br/>

Iksar monk 12<br/>
Wood Elf Ranger 12<br/>
Human Paladin 6<br/>
&quot;just trying all the options to see what I like.&quot;</div>
