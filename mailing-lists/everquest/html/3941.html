<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256092873">Hey cool a fellow Beta tester! I got into it also, I&#39;m really <br/>
excited! <br/>
<br/>
Well I don&#39;t know about it being a &quot;kid&#39;s platform&quot; I&#39;m 33 and think <br/>
it will do great on the PS2. The only thing I think there might be <br/>
issues with regarding it&#39;s survival is the whol PS2 online part. I <br/>
don&#39;t know if there will be too many people that will get the adapter <br/>
or allow their kids to go online with it. Didn&#39;t Nintendo or another <br/>
gaming console maker try that a few years back but it failed? <br/>
Personally there were times I wish I had EQ for my PS2 simply to free <br/>
up my PC for other things. Like I can play EQ all day and the wife <br/>
won&#39;t have to yell at me to get off the PC so she can use it! LOL <br/>
<br/>
You said a regular USB keyboard will work on the PS2? Thats cool, I <br/>
have one so now I won&#39;t have to go buy the PS2 specific one. You know <br/>
what would be great, if you could use those little USB storage <br/>
devices to save info on! God that would rock! <br/>
<br/>
BTW since your also in the Beta, you can PM me anytime and we can <br/>
chat about the game. :)</div>
