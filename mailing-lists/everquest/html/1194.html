<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224048810">Nope, however, it&#39;s kinda lame to do it. Tho, so many say that they are<br/>
facing someone that de-leveled and yet i know about 3 players that have<br/>
REALY done this on Tallon Zek. This is not very common and i would bet that<br/>
you rather meet someone that were better to twink his char than most =P<br/>

&gt; I was wandering around Oasis w/ my 13 bard and my groupmate (higher than<br/>
&gt; me) hot jumped by someone approximately his level (around 14-15), and he<br/>
&gt; said his attacker was &quot;de-leveled&quot; because of the amount of damage he did.<br/>
&gt; Do you not lose your skill levels when you lose a level?<br/>
