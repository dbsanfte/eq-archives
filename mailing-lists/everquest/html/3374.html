<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042277926">HI everyone,<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading this list but havent posted before.<br/>
I have a 51 warrior and a 44 druid. I am currently working on leveling my 31<br/>
cleric. I mainly have her to help my guild with rezzes. Otherwise my warrior<br/>
is my favorite. I&#39;ve been playing a little over a year.<br/>
I agree with you Barto on the lag in the baazar. I cant move or get my mouse<br/>
to work either. I actually walk in there frame by frame and I have a very<br/>
upgraded computer. I&#39;m not doing any selling or buying but my husband does<br/>
sell a lot, so of course I had to go check it out. I&#39;ve turned my clip plane<br/>
almost all the way down and look down a little. thats help me move some. I<br/>
also found because the lag is so bad that people have been doing a lot of<br/>
selling out in the spires.<br/>
How does everyone feel about the new interface? I&#39;m having a hard time<br/>
getting use to it, like someone else said I too am having a problem with the<br/>
chat box on the bottom, I&#39;ve been moving it to the top and faded it so there<br/>
is no background. It makes it easier to target. What I dont like is that we<br/>
cant see ourselves anymore. What I mean is in the other interface when I am<br/>
running I could see behind me when I clicked on the inventory, but now we<br/>
cant do that anymore. All in all I like this new look and the many options<br/>
its given us.<br/>
Hope to talk more soon.<br/>

&gt; Went there this morning to set up some sales. Lag was terrible. It<br/>
&gt; was hard to even get my cursor on target. I suppose it will be ok<br/>
&gt; once I get set up to sell, but the set up is terrible. Move cursor.<br/>
&gt; Not on object. Move a bit more. Not on object. Move back. Click.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t have object. Click again. Hmph. Had object but didn&#39;t know it,<br/>
&gt; and just put it back. Click...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Took so long that I didn&#39;t finish setting up before I had to log. I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t have logged if I could have left my toon to do business<br/>
&gt; while I was gone, but no such luck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just gotta get another machine, faster connection, and retire from<br/>
&gt; my job so that I can play all the time.<br/>
