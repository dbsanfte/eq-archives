&gt; I&#39;m not aware of the nerfs. What happened?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Basically,<br/>
<br/>
-  Cleric CH will only heal up to 7,500 HP, instead of <br/>
the 10,000 previously<br/>
-  Monks won&#39;t avoid damage as easily as previously<br/>
-  Manaburn will only work once per minute on a mob<br/>
-  A bunch of Mod Rod changes.<br/>
<br/>
In reality, these changes only effect about 1% of the <br/>
entire EQ population.  Mod Rod change is probably the <br/>
biggest, considering that the high end Luclin encounters <br/>
rely heavily on them (because the fights are too damn <br/>
long and take too much mana).  CH change doesn&#39;t really <br/>
effect existing content, considering only a handful of <br/>
players can get over the 7500hp mark.  Monks will have a <br/>
tougher time pulling the big mobs in raids, but I&#39;m sure <br/>
that they will figure out a tactic to pull as well as <br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
And Manaburn.....well a few bad Wizards spoiled <br/>
everyone&#39;s fun, although the change really doesn&#39;t hurt <br/>
all that much.</div>
