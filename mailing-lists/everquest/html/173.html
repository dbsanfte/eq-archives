<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580943016">That&#39;s not the real Kerra Isle.  Kerra Isle can be found by going<br/>
through the Toxx Forest outside Erudin.  You have to swim due west<br/>
from the dock with the Necromancer by it.  I use to believe that the<br/>
island between Qeynos and Erudin was Kerra Isle, till I was corrected<br/>
by someone else.<br/>

&gt;If you can make it... Visit Kerra Isle, you can find by taking the boat<br/>
&gt;between Qeynos and Eurdin.  Its loaded with wisp and its just a small<br/>
&gt;island.  You can get stones through-out the day.  But they are easier to see<br/>
&gt;at night because the ones that carry stones light up the ground around them.<br/>
