<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-264578985">Well my ENC is only lvl 50.... it&#39;s mana is 2.4k. But i didn&#39;t buy <br/>
equip to focus on HP (as an Enchanter) but i can&#39;t find where to buy <br/>
the spells over lvl 50.... I thought it would be in Firiona Vie but <br/>
there were no NPCs there =P. I think someone said it is over in the <br/>
corner to the east side but i died trying to get there because the <br/>
spider human things... lol they see invis at random then one attacked <br/>
and they all cames. But luckily due to being a 6 years vete i used the <br/>
Expedient Recovery vete AA. so i lived. But i would love to chat in <br/>
the chat room over the subject, i will be on Tuesday 28th of june <br/>
(today) in the chat room at 5:00 Mountain Time.</div>
