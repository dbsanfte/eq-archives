<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041126007">If you&#39;re a warrior and you&#39;re on a boat, dont just fish or practice sense<br/>
heading. click on the boat (anywhere on the boat) and keep using the taunt<br/>
skill. You can taunt the boat and it will boost your taunting skill level<br/>
pretty fast<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Launching of the TIP List!!!!!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hear Ye, Hear Ye  - Announcing the EQonelist Everquest TIP List!!  I have<br/>
&gt; learned over my many years of traveling throughout the great world of<br/>
&gt; Norrath, that the more I THINK I know about this world, the more I realize<br/>
&gt; how much I DON&#39;T know.  For that reason my fellow adventurers, I propose<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; we generate a list of TIPS that each of us can both share with others and<br/>
&gt; learn from for ourselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here are my proposed rules (subject to modification and advice from<br/>
others):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Only provide 1 or 2 tips at a time, you can add others each day, but<br/>
lets<br/>
&gt; keep these posts short, pithy and informative (less time reading is more<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; playing!!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Tips can be general, trade, race or class specific, so to save time for<br/>
&gt; all, use the subject line in your post to announce what kind of tip you<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; providing. ie -  &quot;General TIP&quot;, Tailoring TIP&quot;, &quot;Wizard TIP&quot;, &quot;Human TIP&quot;<br/>
&gt; .....,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3)  The best TIPS will be those that are not readily apparent, found in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; manual or just plain common sense.  This list should appeal to both<br/>
newbies<br/>
&gt; and veterans alike, but the best TIPS will be those that someone reads and<br/>
&gt; goes &quot;ahhhhh, wow - I never knew that!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I think that&#39;s enough of a format to see how this works.  So come on<br/>
&gt; lads and lasses, let&#39;s start an information revolution the likes of this<br/>
&gt; LISTSERV has never seen!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To get this EQonelist EverQuest TIP LIST off the ground, I will submit my<br/>
&gt; first two TIPS:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GENERAL TIP<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1)  When trading with NPCs in a new city or town (or any town for that<br/>
&gt; matter) /con (&quot;consider&quot;) a bunch of the trading NPCs and see which ones<br/>
look<br/>
&gt; at you the friendliest.  You will get better prices for both sales and<br/>
&gt; purchases of items from these NPCs than ones who look at you indifferently<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; negatively.  This can save you up 30%!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GENERAL TIP<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2)  Never  /shout &quot;HELP!&quot;  - Shouts are heard throughout the entire zone<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; most players that could help you realize that the zone is huge and you are<br/>
&gt; unlikely to be near enough to rescue, thus, they will rarely bother to<br/>
even<br/>
&gt; look.  Always use /say &quot;help&quot;  - Then, whoever hears it will know that you<br/>
&gt; are in the immediate area and will often come to your aid.<br/>
