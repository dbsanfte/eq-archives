<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I playede EQ a lil bit awhile back, and I&#39;m just 
trying to get back into it. I&#39;m having a prolem talking with the NPC&#39;s...I know, 
laugh all ya want...but it&#39;s frustrating since i don&#39;t remember exactly how to 
talk to one, the manual is as useless, since it just says to questio them...no 
formaats or anything...and when I&#39;m talking to someone like Gunlok Jore, the 
paladin...I can hail him, he gives me the spiel...Now HOW DO I BLOODY ASKM HIM 
ABOUT THE UNDEAD? I&#39;ve tried &quot;What about undead?&quot; and so many 
variations...Please give me&nbsp; hand...I know it&#39;s a newbie thing, but it&#39;s 
just annoying as hell...</font></div>
