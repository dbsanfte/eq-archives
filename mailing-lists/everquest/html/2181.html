Very weird. Was there anything different about the gnomes? Did they have red<br/>
text for their names?<br/>
if not, then bug report it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;   I play a level 16 barbarian shaman, and lately ive been trying to<br/>
&gt; fight and level in Oasis of Marr.  Usually im in a group, and as<br/>
&gt; happens when fighiting in Oasis, usually one or more of my party<br/>
&gt; members gets rabies or is poisoned by whatever mob we are fighting at<br/>
&gt; the time.  Since as a shaman i have Cure Disease (which cures rabies)<br/>
&gt; and Cure Poison, i keep them memmed so that if a party member is<br/>
&gt; poisoned or becomes rabid, i can cure them (most of the time, it<br/>
&gt; works on the first cast, the second one if nothing else).  The other<br/>
&gt; day, i was grouped with two gnomes, one a warrior and the other... i<br/>
&gt; cant remember, but he was a gnome too, and another barbarian.  We<br/>
&gt; were fighting a madman or zombie or something like that, and everyone<br/>
&gt; but me got rabies.  I healed the barbarian of it no sweat, but i used<br/>
&gt; up my entire mana bar trying to heal the gnomes!  For some reason, it<br/>
&gt; wouldnt work, no matter how many times i cast it!  So i went to the<br/>
&gt; dock and there were some other random people that were rabid too, and<br/>
&gt; i healed them without a problem, but i still couldnt heal the<br/>
&gt; gnomes!! Should i report this as a bug or is this just something that<br/>
&gt; is the norm?  Help on this matter would be appreciated!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you sooooo much,<br/>
