<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721991399">Permafrost is a good zone for the loot, but hard to run out of if <br/>
overwhelmed. And it is easy to get overwhelmed. I have poked around <br/>
the front of the zone, becoming familiar with it, but I really think <br/>
it is a place for teams more than solo. There are mobs of various <br/>
levels all over the place, and if you turn the wrong corner you have <br/>
three to five of them chasing you out of the zone. With the right <br/>
team one could work systematically into the zone and find the right <br/>
mobs for particular drops.<br/>
<br/>
Most of those I see hunting there are in the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s, killing <br/>
greens for particular loot. I have followed some of them and <br/>
scavanged some things I have needed, but again I will only go so deep <br/>
by myself. For whacking greens for loot it is a great zone. You can <br/>
start at the front and work your way as deep as is safe, then go back <br/>
and start again.<br/>
<br/>
I am finding Gnolls to be good at this time. I can solo them in SK, <br/>
with lots of room for kiting. If things go well I can root and dot <br/>
them across only a small part of the zone, having as much as half of <br/>
my mana left. If things go bad, I can still make the kill before the <br/>
mana is completely drained.<br/>
<br/>
While there I forage for plains pebbles. I have almost a full tool <br/>
box of them in my bank. They are very useful for the Vale tailoring. <br/>

&gt; What about permafrost.?<br/>
&gt; I was out there yesterday and there were only 6 people<br/>
&gt; in there.  Tough to find a group but it seems to have<br/>
&gt; high level monsters in it<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The other day I decided that a trip to Kunark was<br/>
&gt; &gt; in order for my <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; druid. I will be needing Brute hides, and so was<br/>
&gt; &gt; ready to go and <br/>
&gt; &gt; hunt <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never<br/>
&gt; &gt; met the boat. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; they went out to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the<br/>
&gt; &gt; boat left. The <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick<br/>
&gt; &gt; off gnolls, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool<br/>
&gt; &gt; box full of them. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there<br/>
&gt; &gt; until I get the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; gnolls, which I have <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to<br/>
&gt; &gt; sell.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to do it the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; old-fashioned way.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve found the big boat to FV to be broken too. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Luckily I have a <br/>
&gt; &gt; friend that&#39;s a Druid so I got a port to the DL.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried to petition <br/>
&gt; &gt; the GM but it doesn&#39;t work if there isn&#39;t one on!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Kunark is a dangerous place for the good races.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; only place you <br/>
&gt; &gt; can bind a good melee is in FV and it&#39;s surrounded<br/>
&gt; &gt; by mid-level <br/>
&gt; &gt; mobs.  If you port over you end up in the DL, which<br/>
&gt; &gt; is ok, it&#39;s just <br/>
&gt; &gt; getting out of there that&#39;s the problem!  The DL<br/>
&gt; &gt; does have <br/>
&gt; &gt; connections to the FM and FV if you know where to<br/>
&gt; &gt; look.  It&#39;s not a <br/>
&gt; &gt; place to be without a map!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And I am also looking for a place to take me to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; mid-40&#39;s.  I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; &gt; been to the moon, Kunark, the Karanas and Velious. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I like to go to <br/>
&gt; &gt; the zones that have been abandoned, like all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; dungones on <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anatonica.  I&#39;m in the FM now and will probably be<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the DL, like <br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone else. <br/>
