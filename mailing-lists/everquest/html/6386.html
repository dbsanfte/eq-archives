<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904725183">Well wanted to say hello to all. Just joined today! Also started<br/>
playing Everquest like a few days ago. So I hope that this group would<br/>
enhance my game playing. One more thing, I wanted to know how I can<br/>
look for local Everquest groups. I live in Brooksville, FL. So if<br/>
anyone has any ideas, please let me know. Thanks.</div>
