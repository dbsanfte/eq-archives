<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475485544">Talk about questions no one likes to answer.......<br/>
Reason is there is no right answer........<br/>
<br/>
BUT.<br/>
Mike is right, you really need to decide on what and<br/>
HOW you will play.....<br/>
<br/>
The books say there are only tanks and casters so<br/>
first and foremost you need to decide on what you<br/>
PREFER to be as your main, ever enjoying to play,<br/>
character.<br/>
<br/>
Then you can ask yourself if you would like to solo or<br/>
group often.<br/>
<br/>
For servers you should sort by population and pick one<br/>
where you think you would be best, like less lag, less<br/>
camping, would mean a less populated..... more to sell<br/>
to, more to trade with, etc....would mean a higher<br/>
populated server.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing is if you find someone who also plays<br/>
to try and play on that server.  I got four people I<br/>
know into the game and we are all on the same one.<br/>
<br/>
These are some basic questions you should ask yourself<br/>
and then create one and have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some suggestions that I personally used as a<br/>
starting point to help decide.<br/>
<br/>
True Casters........<br/>
Wizard<br/>
Enchanter<br/>
Shaman<br/>
Druid<br/>
Cleric<br/>
Necromancer<br/>
Mage<br/>
<br/>
True Hybrids<br/>
ShadowKnight<br/>
Ranger<br/>
Paladin<br/>
Beastlord<br/>
BARD<br/>
<br/>
True Tanks<br/>
Warrior<br/>
Monk<br/>
Beastlord<br/>
Rogue<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: I may have missed a few and these are my tastes<br/>
and where I chose to pick them.<br/>
<br/>
I play a Druid, Ranger and Mage just because I like<br/>
the flavor of all three and I can also swap depending<br/>
on what my friends are playing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some more hints:<br/>
If you love grouping and being and meeting others a<br/>
cleric is a NEEDED char in any group.<br/>
<br/>
Druids are cool because you can solo and group and get<br/>
some popular spells like Spirit of the Wolf.<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters get the most spells in the game, wizards<br/>
have the most powerful spells, mages have cool spells<br/>
but also get the most powerful pets.<br/>
<br/>
Rangers get track which lets you choose what creature<br/>
you want to kill or pull<br/>
<br/>
Paladins........think if King Arthur type stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Bards....get some very nice stuff too and are good for<br/>
groups......requires a knack to twist the songs<br/>
though....you can read about twisting.<br/>
<br/>
Well enough ranting......and yes all this is open for<br/>
opinion but the fundamentals should be addressed to<br/>
get you thinking along the lines you will be happy<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
HEY and if all else fails....make 2 chars and after a<br/>
little playing decide on what you want.<br/>
<br/>
Never be afraid to ask for help.......most players are<br/>
helpful and enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, honestly, what kinda server do you want to play<br/>
&gt; on? What kind of<br/>
&gt; character would suit you? All classes are good but<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t get good<br/>
&gt; untill a person plays them that enjoys the class.<br/>
