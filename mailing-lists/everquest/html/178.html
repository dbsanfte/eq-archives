<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041568714">I am a beginning smith based in Qeynos and i am having a great deal of<br/>
trouble finding ore near that city.  I was told that the closest place<br/>
to find ore was in the Dwarven area, but I find it hard to believe that<br/>
I would have to go that far!  Does anyone know of a place I can get ore<br/>
within 2or 3 zones of Qeynos?<br/>
