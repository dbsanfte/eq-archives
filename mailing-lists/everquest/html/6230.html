<div id="ygrps-yiv-445373622">Hm, they must have changed it since I played.  It&#39;s been a while.  My <br/>
husband used to play an entertainer, and I thought I remembered him <br/>
dancing in synch.  I could be thinking of the musicians though.<br/>
<br/>
I just holed up in my house and cooked most of the time.  The outside <br/>
SWG world was a mystery to me unless I was harvesting, lol.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure if a squad leader can make the dancers all do the same flourishes but they would have to be doing the same dances. Musicians can only play the song that the first musician started. Dancers can do whatever dance they want.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I played SWG for a while, and dancers work like other classes.  You form <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;bands&quot;  (groups), and the band leader is able to have everyone dance in <br/>
&gt;&gt;synch.  It&#39;s pretty neat.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I sometimes miss that game.  I didn&#39;t think it was as bad as a lot of <br/>
&gt;&gt;people did.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m impressed at how they got all of the dancers dancing in synchronization.<br/>
