<div id="ygrps-yiv-426853171">Life will pick up when you hit 9 and get spells.  I also suggest that you<br/>
just look at most other people your level / class and ask where they got<br/>
their stuff.<br/>
<br/>
oh...and a good shield to get for you is the Shiny Brass Shield...<br/>
<br/>
Just kill the Taskmaster in Crushbone for it...or buy it for the average<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi I am very new to EQ I have been playing for only one month. My <br/>
&gt; ranger is of the 7th season. He has almost a set of leather armor and <br/>
&gt; his skills are in the high 30s.  Am I were I should be or behind the <br/>
&gt; average ranger. I am currently looking to get in a group and explore. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know most people have been around so please understand I am still <br/>
&gt; learning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
