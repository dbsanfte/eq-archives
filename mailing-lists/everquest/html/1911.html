<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147088599">I made it from once from Ak&#39;Anon to Freeport with a level 2 gnome <br/>
enchanter....It took, umm, many many tries. No buffs.<br/>
Highhold Pass was like a giant puzzle.  Great fun. I have done it many <br/>
times since, but the first time was the most fun. Things killed me in <br/>
Kithicor that I had never seen before. Yee haw!<br/>

&gt;- from Rivervale to Freeport, some guy stopped me just before I entered <br/>
&gt;Kithicor because it was 1am, he told me to wait till morning, so i <br/>
&gt;did.  He he, after how far i&#39;d come it would have been very annoying to <br/>
&gt;get killed there.<br/>

&gt;  btw - Ralwen made it to Kelethin so say hi if you&#39;re in the <br/>
&gt; neighbourhood - most peopole there don&#39;t believe that a lv6 could foot it <br/>
&gt; alone from Qeynos, even with the assist through highpass, tho to be <br/>
&gt; honest, with Selo&#39;s most of the zones were easy, especially once i got to <br/>
&gt; the Commons.<br/>

&gt;Hmmm, I tend to be very cautious because I hate CRs so I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;know....  Maybe the stupidest thing I do often is running through Kithicor <br/>
&gt;at any time of the night.  I just get a sow and run up on the side of the <br/>
&gt;hill as fast as I can and never look back.  So far, I&#39;ve been lucky and <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been doing this since my mid teen levels.  Have a friend who says I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;crazy and I should wait until day.<br/>
