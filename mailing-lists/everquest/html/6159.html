Subject: [EverQuest] 25 years from now<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LOL the whole discussion of 25 years from now in EQ land got me <br/>
thinking lol. I hope if by some scary chance EQ is around in 25 years, <br/>
that it would be very cool..more than it is now.<br/>
<br/>
I see us wearing the &quot;VR Suit&quot; instead of using a keyboard. With it <br/>
you would feel it when an orc knocked you on your arse...and all <br/>
movements would respond, like (if my understanding is correct) they do <br/>
with digital animation for movies and such. You make a sword slashing <br/>
move, and your toon does....etc.<br/>
<br/>
Hell, if they&#39;d add that now, lol I&#39;d be there. I magine the workout <br/>
one would get after playing EQ...lol<br/>
<br/>
Just a moronic thought...Greg<br/>
