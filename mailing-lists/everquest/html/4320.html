Giants at the Fort in Frontier Mountains, moving inside as you get into<br/>
the high 20&#39;s low 30&#39;s before moving on at about 35.<br/>

You can also try the Giant Fort in Warsliks Woods, which is lower level<br/>
than the one in FM. A mid-high 20&#39;s group can own the Warsliks Giants<br/>
easily, though the drop rate isn&#39;t as good as in FM, and the general<br/>
loot value is lower.<br/>
