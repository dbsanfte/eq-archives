<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877467703">Sorry but if its brand new... It will run, if not theres something wrong<br/>
with your pc.  How do you know your friend&#39;s system cant handle it?  If ya<br/>
want to post things like this please include your hardware so that we can<br/>
get to the bottom of this issue.  Basically the only new requirements to run<br/>
EQ without Luclin are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
DirectX 8.1    That&#39;s it...  Nothing more :) Enough already.<br/>

<br/>
My sister had a brand new computer-- not a doorstop but even it couldn&#39;t<br/>
handle the new changes. EQ does not still support low end. I&#39;m worried that<br/>
they will someday upgrade beyond my range of being able to afford new<br/>
hardware. My finances are about to take a hit. My dad is getting me new RAM.<br/>
He has the same computer. And I was gonna get a friend of mine to start<br/>
playing EQ but now his system won&#39;t be able to handle it. I just wish things<br/>
weren&#39;t such a hassle. But it could be worse. luv, -Su<br/>

&gt; Yes, and maybe $265 isn&#39;t that much for you. But to some other people<br/>

&gt; rent-to-own basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; easy to say they should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an <br/>

&gt; Verant could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so <br/>
&gt; financially stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if <br/>
&gt; nothing else. Btw, someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap? <br/>
&gt; Where was that again? I just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of <br/>
&gt; RAM with it&#39;s motherboard<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; chipset. luv, -Su<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not cost <br/>
&gt; &gt; that much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only cost me <br/>
&gt; &gt; $265 after tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old system.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; The chip is a AMD Athlon 950.<br/>
