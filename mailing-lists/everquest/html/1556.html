<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547498070">with a voodoo3 3000?<br/>
I have spent hours in tech support trying to get this ressolved but kept<br/>
getting booted out to server select or desktop while waiting my turn and<br/>
losing my place in line..<br/>
My computer screen freezes up at random during eq. I took all of the advice<br/>
suggested to remedy the situation. I even tested the card in another<br/>
computer and it had the same problem.<br/>
Anyone else have a voodoo3 3000?<br/>
luv,<br/>
