  you.<br>I&#39;d love to try it to get the feel of what everyone<br>went through 
  before the expansions.&nbsp; I&#39;ve heard<br>excellent stories from friends 
  who&#39;ve played since the<br>beginning, when dropping your first giant would 
  really<br>mean something. Just seems it would be a good idea to<br>get first 
  had experience of the history in this game.<br><br>--- Greg

  awhile...been busy..<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Anyway, in talking to my old EQ chums 
  and with what<br>&gt; I read on the <br>&gt; websites, there is/has been some 
  talk about SOE<br>&gt; making a &quot;classic&quot; <br>&gt; server.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 
  Now the &quot;classic&quot; server would be EQ prior to PoP,<br>&gt; no adds or toys, 
  <br>&gt; with the exception of the stuff necessary. This<br>&gt; would mean no 
  PoK, no <br>&gt; Guild Lobby, etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Knowing that many of you 
  have been here since around<br>&gt; Beta or just after <br>&gt; and that most 
  of you can honestly say &quot; I remember<br>&gt; when... or Back in <br>&gt; the 
  Day we had to run from X t Y and it was 4 day<br>&gt; run....&quot;; I am <br>&gt; 
  curious to know if any of you kids would use such a<br>&gt; server, or have 
  you <br>&gt; all become stuck on how things are now that going<br>&gt; back to 
  the old way <br>&gt; would kill the game for you?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As always, 
  but now just plainly nosey..<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Greg<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;
