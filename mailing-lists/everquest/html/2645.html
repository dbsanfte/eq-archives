<b>Subject:</b> Re: How do you make money? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330388580">Since I solo a lot, I had to find ways to get exp and money without <br/>
grouping. My choice of a druid helped in this. Knowing I would be <br/>
into the game often but for relatively short periods of time was my <br/>
primary reason for focusing on the solo arts.<br/>
<br/>
I found ghouls to be profitable as they often dropped bronze items. <br/>
Now I often hunt aviaks in sk, as they have good cash drops and also <br/>
drop bronze. There are lots of wanderers in sk, so easy to solo <br/>
without the inconvenience other birds jumping in as at kfc.<br/>
<br/>
I also bag wandering gnolls in sk. I do occasionally join a spire <br/>
group to get lots of gnoll loot, but have found aviaks give me better <br/>
cash flow.<br/>
<br/>
When I get bored with the routine of birding, I go look for a spawn <br/>
somewhere on my item wish list. Don&#39;t really camp them, just pop in <br/>
to see if they are up.<br/>

where everyone is twinked, they often let me get all the loot. </span></blockquote></div>
