<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079947486">this is pretty lame... this is an RPG, but on all the polls, people want<br/>
walkthroughs on quests? where is the fun in that? maybe a hint or 2, but its<br/>
no fun walking around following a guide telling you to avoid so and so<br/>
whatever to not get killed.<br/>
just wondering if anyone aggrees with this...</div>
