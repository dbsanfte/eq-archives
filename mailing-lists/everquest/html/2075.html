<div id="ygrps-yiv-832138466"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; You actually buy a whip that summons the horse. The whips are named for<br/>
&gt; color of horse, and apparently for speed, but the names didn&#39;t make sense<br/>
&gt; to me. They&#39;re sold by a normal merchant, and boy, do you REALLY see how<br/>
&gt; faction/charisma changes the price!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I went there and it looks like a whip but it&#39;s a bridle. The lowest<br/>
end are the brown and tan rope bridles. The highest end I saw were the black<br/>
and white chain bridles. The chain ones went for about 117,000pp (to my wood<br/>
elf druid). The silk bridles ran about 78,000pp. I want to take my bard with<br/>
her charisma gear. The tan and brown silk ones were around 75,000. So i<br/>
guess they figured the black ones and white ones were more sought after. I<br/>
just wish they had other colors. I think it would be cool to have a pinto.<br/>
Or a red horse like the one my sister has in rl. Or a gray one like the<br/>
horse I got for my b-day one year.<br/>
too bad it would be too complicated to give the horses personalities.<br/>
