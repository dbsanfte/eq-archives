 </span></blockquote>Thanks. I found it. Unfortunately, I mistakenly thought that one of <br/>
my Shaman spells was an offensive spell. It was something like Inner <br/>
Fire. It sounded like it would burn something when cast. I died <br/>
about 15 times before I finally figured out that something was <br/>
wrong. I cast the spell on myself and discovered that I was <br/>
increasing my hit points. I hope that the skelletons and the rock <br/>
hoppers appreciated me for being sporting enough to protect them <br/>
from damage while I was fighting them. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Ok. I have a minor healing spell and a spell that raises hit points. <br/>
I have a shaman so I can&#39;t use my club. I tried to equip it with no <br/>
success. I have no money. No one wants to buy mushrooms (must be a <br/>
drug free town). I think that I need to somehow come up with some <br/>
money so that I can buy a scroll with a spell that can do damage. I <br/>
don&#39;t seem to be able to kill anything bare handed. I just keep <br/>
getting killed. Does anybody have any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
I could delete the character, start over, maybe sell one or both of <br/>
my spell scrolls and buy an attack spell scroll. But do I really <br/>
need to? Is there still hope for my character?<br/>
