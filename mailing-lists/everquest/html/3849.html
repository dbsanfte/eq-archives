<div id="ygrps-yiv-501001461">Yeah the LD monster nearly got me killed last night on the Saryrn Server<br/>
when I was playing my newly leveled shaman in EW hunting the uthork.<br/>
Couldn&#39;t have come at a worse time I was OOM, LoHP (maybe had  5% hp),  all<br/>
my buffs were gone  (KEI included), pet was dead, and SoW was going. and I<br/>
had 3 Uthorks decide they wanted to break Enstill all at the same time .  Oh<br/>
and I was soloing it.  Seeing as this was my first time in EW  and I was a<br/>
newly leveled 38 Shammy I was rather quite pleased with myself that I<br/>
managed to hold my own against 4 Uthorks by myself  (well with help from my<br/>
faithful walking dot Xebaner) once and figured I could do it again. Well<br/>
that was when  everything went wrong when the conditions I stated above<br/>
started to occur.  I had almost killed one of the uthorks when the other 3<br/>
decided to break Enstill  and I tried holding my own.  Forgot I was OOM and<br/>
had no more KEI and tried to cast Enstill on the mobs (can we say panic?)<br/>
Finally I gave it up and ran when 2 of the uthorks decided that my pet<br/>
wasn&#39;t worth their time and joined their buddy in chasing me leaving my pet<br/>
to deal with an healthy Uthork. now turning to run probably was my worst<br/>
mistake when I saw those other 2 coming cause I got stunned and started to<br/>
spin. when I stopped spinning I began to run and realized I had no idea<br/>
where the heck I was  Keep in mind I am new to the zone had come in earlier<br/>
with a guildy who took me directly to the Uthorks without giving me a tour<br/>
of the site and logged after we had killed 2 or 3 uthorks.  SO I got lost<br/>
and was  somewhere I have no Idea where in EW when I noticed that I was<br/>
getting no keyboard response.  that&#39;s when  looked at the connection<br/>
indicator and saw that it was  a very broken yellow line that immediately<br/>
went to red and then  I get the &quot;You have been disconnected&quot; message and I<br/>
knew I was a dead lvl 38 Shaman who would most likely be a Naked lvl 37<br/>
Barbarian Shaman standing near the Waterfall in GD when I logged back on.<br/>
When I logged back on I discovered I was on the bridge that goes to IC. And<br/>
I WAS ALIVE With Sow still Blinking at me, still OOM, and 20 hp left on me<br/>
AND STILL LEVEL 38<br/>

&gt; It seems people have been having trouble everywhere.  My guild Hosted a<br/>
Kael raid last night & we had to call it when the LD monster kept rearing<br/>
it&#39;s ugly head.  it seems from what others were saying is people were<br/>
dropping like flies all over the server last night.  (going LD).  hopefully<br/>
this problem will resolve itself =/.<br/>
