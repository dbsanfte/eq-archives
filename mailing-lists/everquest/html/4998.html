get the rez to return you to the zone? And if you didn&#39;t lose xp in the<br/>
first place why would you from being rezzed?<br/>
<br/>
If you were to change death penalties I&#39;d go with an xp debt. Half of<br/>
the xp you subsequently earn goes to paying of the debt rather than<br/>
increasing your current xp. If you log then the debt gets reduced over<br/>
time. After a day or so it is all gone. Thats how it worked in Earth &<br/>
Beyond (the only other mmorpg I have played). It seemed reasonably fair.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t lose levels or skills, and could still gain xp while paying<br/>
off the debt, but if you died repeatedly you could just say what the<br/>
heck, log for the night, and the next day your debt would be gone. If<br/>
you only logged for a few hours only part of your debt would have gone.<br/>
