<b>Subject:</b> Re: Geforce 4 MX vs Geforce 4 Ti <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-719640777">Thanks to everyone for their responses. I take it that, since the Ti <br/>
is not pci format, the Mx will do alright. I was concerned about the <br/>
lack of DirectX 8.1 support. The info I have gathered so far <br/>
indicates that the Mx is built to support DX 7. Anyone know how the <br/>
lack of 8.1 support might affect the game? Everyone who has come in <br/>
positive for the Mx has said the frame rates are good enough. What <br/>
about other graphics factors?<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone run both the Mx and Ti on the same system? How did they <br/>
compare? Since I cannot run the Ti due to lack of pci, what am I <br/>
missing? Also, how does the Mx compare to a Gforce2 with the 64 <br/>
memory load? Anyone have experience with such?<br/>
