<b>Subject:</b> Hi I&#39;m new <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-491676729">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing for about 2 1/2 yrs on Bristlebane. I managed to <br/>
force my hef rgr to lvl 18/19--18 is where I spend most of my time, <br/>
but sometimes I lvl to 19. <br/>
<br/>
I have been recently been building my fletching skills(104). I spent <br/>
about 4hrs a day hunting in front of Qeynos killing green mobs for <br/>
about 3wks. All I make is about 150plat in the 4 hrs with no exp, but <br/>
when I go hunting elswere--like bb--I only get about 5 plat for 4 hrs <br/>
and some exp. I seem to go up about 2 skill points in that time in <br/>
front of Qeynos. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to complain, but I am starting to feel sorry for all <br/>
knolls and gopher snakes I&#39;ve killed. Plus I would like to be able to <br/>
do more quests.<br/>
<br/>
I do want to earn everything myself, but would like to know where I <br/>
can earn some serious plat? I have heard of people lvl 12 earning 4-<br/>
5000 plat/hr. <br/>
<br/>
How do they do that?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
