<div id="ygrps-yiv-565049710">It is there if you read carefully.  The minions of the dark gods <br/>
destroyed the gate on Luclin which caused the moon to shatter.  The <br/>
feedback also blew up all gates on Norrath, including the Druid rings <br/>
and Pyramids.<br/>
<br/>
Considering the massive number of people killed I doubt a lot of <br/>
people would survive to see EQ2.  At least that&#39;s how Sony sees it! <br/>

&gt; No one knows why Luclin blew up (if I&#39;m remembering right). It&#39;s <br/>
part<br/>
&gt; of the lore of the game we&#39;re supposed to discover.  The Vah Shir <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; gone, but we have the Kerrans now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve a feeling that another moon will be discovered though, <br/>
according<br/>
&gt; to what a lot of the NPCs say.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh cool!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though. Plus EQ2 <br/>
could be considered a parrallel universe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t know Luclin had exploded in EQ2. Did they say the story <br/>
behind why? What happened to the poor Vah Shir?<br/>
&gt; &gt; I imagine in 25 years the game interfaces will be much more <br/>
advanced. Maybe there will be EQ 1.5 or 1.9A or something. :-D<br/>
