<div id="ygrps-yiv-196420514">Alrighty then lol.. thank you all for all of your help, it is very <br/>
much appreciated. Hopefully it will help me, this&#39;ll be my first tyme <br/>
playing eq.. I did a buncha research and educated myself in alot of <br/>
different assets of the game, so maybe that&#39;ll help too... anyways I <br/>
have decided that STA is more important than STR, but STR is still <br/>
important. I&#39;m going with 15 stamina and 5 strength. Once again, <br/>
thanx lots for all of your help ^_^</div>
