<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Keep in mind that druids can also have pets.&nbsp; 
Just not the same way.&nbsp; Druids have a charm animals spell.&nbsp; You can 
charm an animal and it will react the same way a pet would.&nbsp; Then get it to 
fight your mobs for you.&nbsp; If it dies, charm another animal.&nbsp; The 
problem with this is that if the charm breaks during the middle of the fight, 
then you got two mobs that wanna kill you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Me, personally, I never 
use pets with my druid.&nbsp; Then again I&#39;m also not concerned about who can 
outsolo me either.&nbsp; I just do what I do and that&#39;s fine with 
me.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>You need to remember Necro has the best pet in the<br>game 
  and they are also the best solo class.<br><br>They are designed to solo and 
  even though druids are<br>to, I really think Druids are better in 
  groups<br><br>also Necro&#39;s can Life tap.<br><br>It does not surpise me that a 
  Necro 3 levels lower can<br>out solo you.<br><br>here is an example.&nbsp; I 
  had a level 18 mage and my<br>friend was level 20 druid.&nbsp; I can solo 
  yellow Crag<br>Spiders in EK and his druid has trouble.&nbsp; The water<br>pet 
  is better against poisons and the pets can take<br>the beating while I cast 
  DD&#39;s.<br><br>SO I think this is what you are experiencing.<br><br>Hope this 
  helps<br><br>Rob<br><br>--- mlockridge01 &lt;MLockridge01@...&gt;

  once have I <br>&gt; had to wait for the camp. That time I was 
  following<br>&gt; a Necro, lvl 30. <br>&gt; Watched his kills. Much faster 
  than mine. Curious as<br>&gt; to whether this <br>&gt; is normal.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; Perhaps my technique is flakey. I ensnare,<br>&gt; ensnarring root, 
  dot, dot, <br>&gt; and med. Have to often refresh the root at least<br>&gt; 
  once. Then refresh <br>&gt; one dot. Dead brute. Not too fast, but 
  affective.<br>&gt; This is on dark <br>&gt; blue brutes with me at lvl 
  33.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If it goes well I come out down only one bubble 
  of<br>&gt; mana. Usually at <br>&gt; least half. Only twice did I get low, and 
  then I<br>&gt; just burned the rest <br>&gt; on nukes to finish the kill. 
  Didn&#39;t want to waste<br>&gt; mana on roots that <br>&gt; weren&#39;t 
  holding.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I am working as a pure caster now, and this is 
  my<br>&gt; highest level <br>&gt; character. I am unfamiliar with hybrids, 
  but<br>&gt; watching a lower level <br>&gt; necro outpace my kills made me 
  wonder if I could not<br>&gt; do better.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Any 
  thoughts?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br>&gt; <br>&gt;
