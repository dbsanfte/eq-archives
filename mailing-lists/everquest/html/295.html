<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-487802085">I have a question regarding the Kick skill.  My ranger (10th) has supposedly had the<br/>
kick ability since level 5.  I spend a couple of &#39;seed-points&#39; in the skill at that<br/>
time and was hoping that it would increase like all combat skills.  It has not.  As<br/>
an experiment, I dropped another 15 points into it, so that it is now like 17-18.  I<br/>
have NEVER successfully kicked anything.<br/>
<br/>
I recently acquired the dodge skill, spent a couple of seed points and it has<br/>
increased to 45 with use.<br/>
<br/>
What am I doing wrong?<br/>
