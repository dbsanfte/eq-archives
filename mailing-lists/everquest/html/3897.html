<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378944105">BAH! tell your parents to shut up, 48 hours just played on the bad <br/>
news about the game, if that were true then they would also play on <br/>
Ultima Online and Ashron&#39;s call 1 and 2 and also Dark Age of Camelot. <br/>
They just played on that story because more people that I know play <br/>
Everquest than any other online game, people who have quit EQ has <br/>
come back because it is by far that I heard of the superior of the <br/>
breed of online games. BAH!!! Listen to the REAL news like CNN and <br/>
stuff, don&#39;t listen to 48 hours or talk shows, they only want <br/>
ratings, tell your Parents that if they got a problem with EQ talk to <br/>
me I&#39;ll knock some sense into them! I&#39;ve been playing for 2 years, my <br/>
cousin&#39;s been playing since it game out along with his friends and <br/>
they&#39;re fine. yeah There are obsessed people out there but that&#39;s for <br/>
all the games not just EQ. I mean there are stalkers out there also. <br/>
jeezuz, and if they talk to me about the game tell them to email me <br/>
or shut up about giveing you crap about EQ. Same goes for anyone else <br/>
who has this problem, tell your parents to get over it, if they KNOW <br/>
you and they should, then there is no problems unless you&#39;ve done <br/>
that kind of stupid stuff before (suicide), I mean as you all <br/>
probally heard about EQ that guy who commited suicide had a mentel <br/>
condition, hopefully none of you have that problem, and if you do, <br/>
just be safe ^_^. <br/>

&gt; Has anyone heard the news lately about EverQuest? They said that <br/>
millions of <br/>
&gt; people play this game daily, and there have been many suicides <br/>
brought on by <br/>
&gt; it. They also said people become obsessed and make the game their <br/>
&gt; life...they don&#39;t get jobs or do anything else, just play all the <br/>
time. My <br/>
&gt; parents are now concerned and told me as soon as they see any signs <br/>
that I <br/>
&gt; am going to kill myself, they are taking the game away. I can&#39;t <br/>
believe <br/>
&gt; that...the game is fun, yeah, but to end your life over it? Come on.<br/>
