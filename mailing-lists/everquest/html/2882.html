<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, there isn&#39;t a real guide on tailoring, yet, but you don&#39;t really<br/>
need a special guide on that, because just have a look at eqtraders,<br/>
check the recipes and trade supplies sections. try to find something<br/>
with components that are easy to get, and are 10 to 50 above your<br/>
current skill. most of the time you will end up doing cured silk (up<br/>
to 82 i think) and wu&#39;s armor afterwards (that&#39;s up to 158).<br/>
<br/>
then put on your INT (for learning skills faster) and WIS (reducing<br/>
failures) gear. why to reduce failures with the WIS gear, to get back<br/>
some of the expenses you have. maybe add some CHA buffs as well, and<br/>
sell in a town where they like you ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
also try to find things that are stackable (components or results)<br/>
because you can do more in a given time if you don&#39;t have to sell<br/>
things to a merchant every four pieces you made. if you need<br/>
components from different vendors, try to find a town (or place)<br/>
where such merchants are close to each other.<br/>
<br/>
also check out the new recipes that were added with the last patch,<br/>
there are much more things to choose from ... main problem with the<br/>
new ones: not all trivals are listed/known, yet, but you can make<br/>
others happy if you find &quot;unknown&quot; trivals and post them on eqtraders.<br/>
<br/>
another thing: don&#39;t even think about pieces that need a 200 skill.<br/>
those recipes need rare drop or very expensive components. and this<br/>
isn&#39;t good to raise a tradeskill in a short time.<br/>
