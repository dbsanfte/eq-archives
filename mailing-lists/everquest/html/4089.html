<div id="ygrps-yiv-282541696"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ...<br/>
&gt; Najina its worthwhile picking up the pages for your epic as well. <br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yes, too true! now i remember that i had to go back again to Najena,<br/>
just to collect those pages. i was so ignorant about the epic, that i<br/>
threw away the pages, when i did the focus items. very stupid move.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My next question is, are the items No-Drop or can anyone get them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i didn&#39;t check allakhazam (and i don&#39;t remember), but i believe, some<br/>
parts are NO DROP. the focus item&#39;s are NO DROP for sure (some of<br/>
them are also needed for epic).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
besides, last saturday i have been to drake isle in sky for the first<br/>
time. i was guest of another guild&#39;s raid, and they made it there for<br/>
the first time. even only their mage got a crown (and i am really<br/>
happy for him) it was quite an experience: after i couldn&#39;t see spirocs anymore, we finally hit the bees, well, all went good until <br/>
the boss whiped out the whole raid, but we were prepared, so after<br/>
recovering from this it was almost easy ... :)<br/>
<br/>
after 2 years working for the epic, i lost the faith in getting it. or, well, it isn&#39;t my motivation for EQ anymore. if i should get the<br/>
last 3 missing pieces (water staff, earth staff, sky crown), i would<br/>
be very happy ... but i don&#39;t count on it.<br/>
