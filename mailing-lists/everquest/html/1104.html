<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; I not sure why but I am running a Celeron 
533, 160 MB RAM amd a 256k DSL modem and it only takes me about 20-30 sec to 
zone.&nbsp; On my 56k it took me about a minute or two.&nbsp; So I don&#39;t think 
it is your computer.&nbsp; It also helps to have a big swap file set aside I 
have 1GB as a minimum swap file size.</font></div></html></div>
