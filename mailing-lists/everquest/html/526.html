<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999104811">I&#39;m not sure I like that idea... and if you can whack something for 5mins..<br/>
and still not have done at least half the damage - only to have the creature<br/>
killed by a magic character - seems to say to me you couldn&#39;t handle the NPC<br/>
anyways. Just an opinion.<br/>

Another good way of ensuring a fair exp split would be to take account of<br/>
the time that each person has been engaged with a mob- that way if a warrior<br/>
has been slogging away for 5 minutes, and a caster comes in an nukes for<br/>
over half the damage, the warrior will still either get all the exp, or at<br/>
least a fair percentage of it. I am sure there must be some sliding scale of<br/>
damage done versus damage taken versus time engaged that would ensure the<br/>
correct split.<br/>

I have to comment that I decline to respond to the questionnaire because I<br/>
don&#39;t like the choices - it is too black and white...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t kill-steal - and I don&#39;t think it is in the spirit of role-play.<br/>
And I also don&#39;t think it &quot;ruins&quot; the game.  I think that simply there are<br/>
&quot;problems&quot; with the code as it is designed to determine who gets credit for<br/>
the kill.  I think that minor not drastic changes are in order.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless - you are a bit out of date in that Verant has acknowledged the<br/>
problem and will be addressing it.  They stated (and I&#39;m paraphrasing) that<br/>
the current system is such that it rewards solo over groups and they want to<br/>
change it to tilt towards group - since their philosophy of the game is to<br/>
promote grouping.<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it - the main problem is that it only looks at damage against<br/>
the mob and doesn&#39;t incorporate the damage that the players receive...<br/>
