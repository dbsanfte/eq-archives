<div id="ygrps-yiv-136272868">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I have a 5th level monk in freeport on fennin ro. I<br/>
decided early on to use dual hammers as weapons this<br/>
seems to work out well my stats are ( Or close to) DW<br/>
38 OF 27 Def 28 HTH 12 Kick 17. So here are my<br/>
questions. One should I give up on the Hammers and<br/>
just use my fists ( They seem to do simular damage I<br/>
just like the Hammers) Or should I keep using the<br/>
hammers or switch to another weapon. Also I have been<br/>
looking for hammers better than rusty but cant find<br/>
any to purchase and dont know where to look. I have<br/>
asked around but to no avail. One more question, where<br/>
near freeport should I be adventuring to find better<br/>
stuff. I have tried the bandits but they kill me quick<br/>
and whoever I am with. The Fire Bugs and Armidillas<br/>
are the only mobs that still give exp. Every once in a<br/>
while I can take out a puma or jackal when I can find<br/>
them. I am a half a bubble away from 6 so my guess is<br/>
that the Fire Bugs and armmildillas wont be providing<br/>
exp much longer. Also has anyone ever looted anything<br/>
from an armidilla? Well any other words of advice<br/>
would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
