<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011707271">Those giants drop 30 plats or so common.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think any other mob in the game drops that much plat. <br/>
Maybe a full group of 20+ could kill one?  They are<br/>
not that hard to pull, and its outdoors so maybe they<br/>
could be kited.<br/>

&gt; and thanks for fixing <br/>
&gt; that little problem with the auto. messages, Su. It<br/>
&gt; was getting annoying, <br/>
&gt; LOL. To whoever it was that is seeking platnum...<br/>
&gt; although it&#39;s very hard, <br/>
&gt; you could kill giants in the Frontier Mountains.<br/>
&gt; Some of them drop Forest <br/>
&gt; Loops that sell for 300 platnum. However, like I<br/>
&gt; said, it&#39;s rare that they <br/>
&gt; drop them, but I have looted one from before. It<br/>
&gt; just takes patience, <br/>
&gt; although the experience sucks... it did for me<br/>
&gt; anyway.<br/>
