<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425363144">I would also like to say that I know this game has been out for ages, <br/>
but I have only been playing for a couple of weeks now. I am new to <br/>
the online gaming world. <br/>
<br/>
I know that a lot of questions have been answered in the past, but <br/>
who honestly has time to go back and read all of that stuff? <br/>
Especially when we spend all of our free time on EQ! LOL. <br/>
<br/>
Please be patient with me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
