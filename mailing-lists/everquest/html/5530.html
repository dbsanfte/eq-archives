Whatever you do I seriously wouldn&#39;t suggest letting a friend use your<br/>
account.  While I was on westpac for 9 months I let my friend (who<br/>
introduced me into EQ) use my account since I wouldn&#39;t be able to play<br/>
while I was overseas in the gulf.  Well when I came back all my<br/>
characters were naked and all they had in their inventorys were trader&#39;s<br/>
sacks.  Of course they were in the bazaar.  All my gear on all my<br/>
characters had been sold in the bazaar and I had some really expensive<br/>
stuff like a couple 30k horses. Of course it was my fault giving him my<br/>
account to use in the first place. If you are worried about loosing all<br/>
your gear then take my advice - never give your account to your friends.<br/>

I am back in school and working full time so I don&#39;t have time for all<br/>
my hobbies.  I was thinking of canceling my EQ account for the semester<br/>
and picking it back up later.  I am only 2 semester from graduation<br/>
(then I will have a degree showing I can do what I have been doing for<br/>
the past 8 years). How long after you cancel your account will your<br/>
stuff get erased?  I would hate to start back up later and find all my<br/>
loot was gone.  While paying for the account would not break me I just<br/>
hate the feeling that I am wasting money that could be better spent on<br/>
my RC racing hobby.  Sorry, won&#39;t give up RC for EQ.  It gets me out of<br/>
the house and with real people, and sadly is the second most physical<br/>
activity I engage in.<br/>
<br/>
I did have another idea.  Let a friend use the account and just tell him<br/>
to stay off Tunare where my guys are.  While not any cheaper it would<br/>
help me with the &quot;waste&quot; aspect.  What happens if he is in the game and<br/>
I try and log in for a quick game?  Will it give me an error, kick him<br/>
out, suspend the account, alert the Sony SWAT team?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Thanks for help with this in advance and for all the help I<br/>
have gotten previously.<br/>
