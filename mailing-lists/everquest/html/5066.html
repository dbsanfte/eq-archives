<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; I am back. I have been gone for awhile. But, 
for the ones that are new and dont remember me. I am David, I am 29. I play 
EverQuest on a normal bases. But, right now I havent been on for a while because 
I had to let my scribes go for the time being. I am planning to get back soon. I 
want to get the two newiest expanesion. Lancy of Ysheka, and the lost dangunes. 
Please forgive me I am a bad speller. But I like to keep up with it. I have a 
question where do you get EQ IM? And, does it cost anythign extra? Is there in 
thing great about those expanses? I know I have alot of questions. But, I 
remember that you guys are really helpful, and I am glad. I hope to make some 
friends that like the samethings I do.</font></div>
