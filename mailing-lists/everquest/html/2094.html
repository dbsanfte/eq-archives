<div id="ygrps-yiv-473307498">And sometimes if you can&#39;t see your corpse, just click on yourself and type<br/>
/corpse or make a /corpse hotkey and just keep hitting it until it gives you<br/>
the message &quot;summoning corpse&quot;. this is useful when your corpse is<br/>
underwater, underground, in a tree, wall or rock.<br/>
