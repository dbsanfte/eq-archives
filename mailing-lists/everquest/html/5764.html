<div id="ygrps-yiv-948445933">Hi, I am new to this list and just want to make an<br/>
introduction of myself.<br/>
<br/>
Gamer self:<br/>
My main character is Starnyte Moonlyte.  She is a lvl<br/>
60 woodelf ranger and only about 30% away from hitting<br/>
level 61.  She resides on the Tunare server and is a<br/>
member of the guild Infinite Storm.<br/>
(working on a character story for her... its a long<br/>
one and consists of close to 4 chapters now.  Can&#39;t<br/>
seem to condense it very well.  To much of a story<br/>
teller in me to make anything to short)<br/>
I have 3 others that I play as often as I can when<br/>
there is nothing to do on my main and a few others<br/>
that have just seem to be hybernating.  All 8 slots<br/>
filled for my server.  Alt mains (as I call them):<br/>
Yissia Hissnpounce - 27 Berserker<br/>
Starnova Daemonhart - 29 Wizard<br/>
Kairii Ragingfire - 25 monk<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Real self<br/>
My name is Celena but friends call me Lena.  I live in<br/>
Virginia Beach, VA and am a 21 year old female.  Still<br/>
in college slowly working to my associates for Network<br/>
Engineering.<br/>
I have been into gaming since I was about 6 years old.<br/>
 My dad then bought me and my brother (then 3) a<br/>
Nintendo System.  Whoo.. we were so happy but what<br/>
child probably wasn&#39;t to have one of those back then. <br/>
I could never really pass a normal RPG game.  Came<br/>
close to beating Mario 3 before but never succeeded. <br/>
I used to just give up on them.  I have played games<br/>
from many systems including your table-top dice games.<br/>
 When my dad got me my computer at age 14 I became<br/>
more glued to PC games.  Never had an online game<br/>
until after high school.  I constantly saw EQ on the<br/>
shelf in many stores and one of my friends noticed me<br/>
always looking at the game everytime we went to<br/>
stores.  So xmas of 2001 I ended up with EQ trilogy<br/>
and Luclin.  Been playing since May of 2002 (had to<br/>
upgrade system before I could play).<br/>
<br/>
Now I am gonna stop blabbing and again say hello again<br/>
to allof you out there.<br/>

&quot;Yes, I am a ranger&quot;<br/>
&quot;Good.  I have a task for you&quot; *whispers to the elf*<br/>
&quot;You want me to be WHAT!!!!&quot;<br/>
*The Dwarf nods*<br/>
&quot;Thats suicide!&quot;<br/>
&quot;No I will not be your bait to that dreadful dragon!  Find someone else.  Like maybe a human monk.&quot;<br/>
&quot;But we heard Dragons prefer the fear of a ranger.  Especially an elven rangeress.&quot;<br/>
*Huntress Starnyte storms away from the village muttering foul words in the Feir&#39;Dal language*<br/>
&quot;Dwarves are only good to be food to the lizardmen, not party members.&quot;<br/>
