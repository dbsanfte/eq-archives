&gt;<br/>
&gt; From the Daytona Beach News-Journal (I love their<br/>
&gt; weird news stuff!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cygnets, eels, gannets and gulls -- all on the menu<br/>
&gt; for nobles of medieval England<br/>
&gt; News-Journal wire services<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; LONDON -- Chopped sparrow, roast swan, poached pike,<br/>
&gt; conger eel, porpoise and lamprey: if it walked, swam<br/>
&gt; or flew, the English medieval nobility ate it --<br/>
&gt; usually with a dash of cinnamon, ginger or cloves --<br/>
&gt; according to an ancient cookbook released to the<br/>
&gt; public Thursday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dating from 1500, &quot;A noble bok of festes ryalle and<br/>
&gt; cokery, A bok for a Prynces housholde&quot; is the earliest<br/>
&gt; copy of a printed cookbook in English, according to<br/>
&gt; the British Library. It has been in the archives of<br/>
&gt; Longleat House, the country seat of the Marquess of<br/>
&gt; Bath, since the 18th century, but until now has been<br/>
&gt; reserved for scholarly use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Longleat staff now plan to publish copies of the book.<br/>
&gt; They have reproduced and eaten some of the recipes,<br/>
&gt; including &quot;pyke and eles in balloke broth,&quot; a dish of<br/>
&gt; pike and eels spiced with cloves, cinnamon and<br/>
&gt; saffron, and a mixture of milk and colored eggs called<br/>
&gt; &quot;ledlardes.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The pike and eels were very strong ... and when we<br/>
&gt; made the dish we weren&#39;t as liberal with the spices as<br/>
&gt; they were -- so it was pretty clear that medieval<br/>
&gt; nobles didn&#39;t like bland food,&quot; said Kate Harris,<br/>
&gt; Longleat&#39;s librarian and archivist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At least one noblewoman adored the dish: &quot;That must<br/>
&gt; our dame have or els she will be wrothe (angry),&quot; the<br/>
&gt; book notes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Historians say the 80-page book offers new insight<br/>
&gt; into the life of England&#39;s nobility, including its<br/>
&gt; kings and archbishops, and was designed for the<br/>
&gt; merchant and gentry classes who aspired to copy their<br/>
&gt; betters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is divided into three sections: a history of noble<br/>
&gt; feasts, including the banquet at King Henry V&#39;s<br/>
&gt; coronation in 1413, a calendar of seasonal foods and a<br/>
&gt; list of ingredients.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unlike modern cookbooks, it does not give quantities<br/>
&gt; or cooking times -- cooks to the nobility were<br/>
&gt; expected to be skilled enough to judge that for<br/>
&gt; themselves. Scribbled Latin notes in the margin show<br/>
&gt; that the book was used.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The book was printed by London-based printer Richard<br/>
&gt; Pynson, a Norman who later became the king&#39;s official<br/>
&gt; printer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Harris said it was brought to Longleat when Elizabeth<br/>
&gt; Harley, whose mother Margaret later became the first<br/>
&gt; Duchess of Portland, married the first Marquess of<br/>
&gt; Bath in 1759.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The book reveals that Henry V&#39;s coronation feast<br/>
&gt; featured a first course of 31 swans, roasted and<br/>
&gt; probably redressed in their feathers. All carried<br/>
&gt; signs praising the king.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This was followed by dishes of venison, antelope,<br/>
&gt; porpoises and a range of fish, including carp, perch,<br/>
&gt; and lamprey, on which King Henry I is said to have<br/>
&gt; gorged himself to death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is no mention of vegetables, and desserts are<br/>
&gt; mentioned in passing as &quot;dowcetes.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Harris said menus for a feast for George Nevill, who<br/>
&gt; became archbishop of York in 1465, list a wide range<br/>
&gt; of bird dishes including sparrows, gannets, gulls,<br/>
&gt; larks and peacocks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Presentation was lavish, with many animals served<br/>
&gt; whole. Tables were often decorated with sugar<br/>
&gt; sculptures that were painted and sometimes even<br/>
&gt; gilded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Harris said that contrary to popular belief, the<br/>
&gt; nobility ate tidily and wasted little. They had knives<br/>
&gt; and spoons, but used fingers instead of forks, a later<br/>
&gt; Italian invention.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; At least with stuffed peacock, you have a really nice<br/>
&gt; flourishy toothpick as a souvenir when the meal is<br/>
&gt; finished....<br/>

&gt; yummy with her cup of espresso right now)<br/>
