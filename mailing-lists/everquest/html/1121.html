<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921292739">When the guard kills it, you get not experience and the mob leaves no<br/>
corpse.  Its as if the guard had killed it from beginning to end, you<br/>
doing over 50% damage doesn&#39;t matter.  The reason for this is so people<br/>
don&#39;t just go do alot of damage to mobs and then train them to the guards<br/>
to finish the mob off.<br/>

&gt; When you&#39;re fighting something, and you&#39;re so close to killing it, and a<br/>
&gt; guard or whatever comes along and deals the last blow, kills it, and it<br/>
&gt; vanishes....does that count like it killed it from beginning to end?<br/>
&gt; Doesn&#39;t it count if you do more than 50% of the damage to the critter?<br/>
