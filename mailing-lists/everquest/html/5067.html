<div id="ygrps-yiv-210447926">Ooh, I&#39;ll have to check out the poachers there sometime.<br/>
I have my tailoring at 167. I don&#39;t have much money and don&#39;t get to play as<br/>
often as I&#39;d like. I want to save my money up and am trying to figure out<br/>
the cheapest and easiest way to raise my tailoring to the 200s so I can do<br/>
my 6th shawl combine.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We bought the expansion for some of the features, rather than any<br/>
&gt; &gt; plans to go there. However, since we got the new computer, I have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking of someday making the trip.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Trouble is, I don&#39;t know how to get there. Granted, I haven&#39;t yet<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried, but when I look on some of the EQ sites I visit, I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; &gt; any way to get there. Is there a boat? From where? Is it even worth<br/>
&gt; &gt; going there?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t even gone to Jagged Pines since we got a machine that makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; the zone playable. In fact, I need to visit lots of places. I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; only limited experience on Luclin due to the lag. Been working Crystal<br/>
&gt; &gt; Caverns this last week, my first week on the new machine.<br/>
