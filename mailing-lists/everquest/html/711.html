<b>Subject:</b> Re: Fed up with EQ - any ideas?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420763518">When you&#39;re looking at EQ you have to realize something, its part of the first<br/>
in a long line of games to come. EQ, AC, and UO were pretty much the first in<br/>
this genre, and like that will very soon not fit the players needs. As the<br/>
people play more and more, they expect more and more from the game. Coney Island<br/>
was originally a huge attraction because of its many many lights, however, the<br/>
people began demanding more and more. EQ, UO, and AC in this genre you could<br/>
relate pretty much to doom in the 1st person shooter genre. Things will only<br/>
build from here, as the players demand more and more, the companies will produce<br/>
bigger and better games trying to fit the players demands. Am I saying that EQ<br/>
is no longer worth playing, no. EQ is a really great game, and despite the<br/>
debate as to whether the changes within it are good or bad, it still attracts<br/>
many people. However, EQ is a dying game, I personally do not intend to give up<br/>
on it because it satisfies my needs in gaming for now, however the companies,<br/>
seeing that this is a very good market will keep releasing bigger and better<br/>
games. I imagine there to be a flood of titles coming in, and within a year or<br/>
so, one of them will fight its way to the top, such as half life, or unreal in<br/>
the 1st person shooter genre. EQ isn&#39;t any worse then when people first started<br/>
playing and loved it. The thing is that the players demands are increasing more<br/>
and more, and EQ is striving to keep up. The only question is, how long can it<br/>
last?</div>
