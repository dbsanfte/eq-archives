<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774159947">I got Planes of Power yesterday...my boyfriend bought it for me. He is <br/>
nuts...he bought me EverQuest, Ruins of Kunark, Shadows of Luclin and now <br/>
Planes of Power, all in a month or so...he is spoiling me! I keep telling <br/>
him no more, I will buy the expansions I need, but he doesn&#39;t listen...he <br/>
also bought me a three month EverQuest card. He is completely nuts, but I am <br/>
very thankful. I ordered him the Scars of Velious expansion off of <br/>
EBay...that is the only expansion he needs. Same here.<br/>
<br/>
As for learning how to play EverQuest, I know how the newbies feel. I am <br/>
fairly new, and if it wasn&#39;t for my boyfriend to teach me everything, I <br/>
would be so lost. Just remember these few codes:<br/>
<br/>
/ooc - Sends an out of character message<br/>
/shout -Sends a shout<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions what something means, just shout it or send an out <br/>
of character message and someone will help you out. I still have to shout <br/>
questions. You will catch on quickly. If you have any questions, feel free <br/>
to email me at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Thunder_Cat_4283@...">Thunder_Cat_4283@...</a> and I will do what I can to <br/>
help you out. Also, here are a few short hands:<br/>
<br/>
PST = Please Send Tell<br/>
WTS = Willing to Sell<br/>
WTB = Willing to Buy<br/>
LFG = Looking for Group<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and have fun playing!<br/>
