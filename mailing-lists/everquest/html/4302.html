<b>Subject:</b> OT: Lyrist put to No Email <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-364509769">Since that Lyrist thing kept spamming people everytime they posted I put the<br/>
account it was associated with on No Email.<br/>
I tried to email the person to inform them of this but only got one of those<br/>
annoying automated responses.<br/>
Hopefully the problem will stop now that they are no longer being sent<br/>
messages.<br/>
luv,<br/>
