<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You are making this sound, however, that melee 
classes are automatically given better weapons and armor at higher levels.&nbsp; 
That is not always the case.&nbsp; At level 30, a rogue has trained any skills 
he can train until level 50.&nbsp; He does NOT automatically get better gear 
every few levels.&nbsp; If a rogue wants better gear he&#39;s gonna have to loot it 
or buy it.&nbsp; So I do not necessarily think that equipment upgrades count in 
the overall scheme of things.&nbsp; If I work mainly on xp and not for plat, I 
could potentially be using the same gear at level 50 as I was at level 30.&nbsp;

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Currently,&nbsp; my rogue is level 35, and I&#39;m 
beginning to see exactly where I need to upgrade equipment.&nbsp; Particularly I 
need a better bow for archery.&nbsp; And I need some + STA gear.&nbsp; So I know 
what I need to work on.</font></div>

  forget one thing, you seem to complain that you don&#39;t get anything untill 
  level 50. That&#39;s not the case, most meleers seems to forget that they do get 
  their upgrades in form of weapons. If you didn&#39;t think your gear did a huge 
  impact it&#39;s time to think again and start checking how to exp while gaining as 
  good gear as possible during your lower levels. Check safehouse as someone 
  else mentioned, that forum has all the info you need (don&#39;t forget the search 
  function, people can get somewhat irritated on new people asking questions 
  that has been asked 100 times in the past few days =P).</font></span></div>

    Playing a rogue<br><br></font></div>
    <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps you people can help me.&nbsp; This is 
    something I&#39;ve pondered for awhile.</font></div>
    <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><font face="Arial" size="2">My rogue is level 32.&nbsp; I play him 
    infrequently.&nbsp; At level 30 rogues get all the skills they are going to 
    get.&nbsp; Rogues are non-casters so they don&#39;t have new spells to look 
    forward to.&nbsp; The only things rogues have to look forward to are their 
    disciplines at level 50.&nbsp; So how does one get from level 30 to level 50 
    in the shortest amount of time possible?&nbsp; Whenever I play, it seems 
    like I always have a hard time finding a group.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking in places 
    like Frontier Mountains, The Overthere, and Dawnshroud Peaks.&nbsp; I&#39;m not 
    high enough level that I can easily solo any mobs in either of those zones. 
    But nobody seems to want to group.&nbsp; So are there any zones where I can 
    get quick xp by soloing?&nbsp; Or are there other zones I could try for 
    groups?&nbsp; </font></div>
    <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I hate for my rogue to fall by the way side 
    because he&#39;s become a bore to play.&nbsp; So any suggestions you have for 
    playing rogue characters to help me out would be appreciated.</font></div>
    <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks in advance.</font></div>
