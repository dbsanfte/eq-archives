<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064332295">One other thing I just thought about.  I did not fight for the Griffon <br/>
Feather. I bought it from a vendor, as well as the Ruby.  I feel confident it <br/>
is okay to use a bought Ruby, but not so confident about the Griffon Feather. <br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

&gt; I will check a couple of resources to see if that is<br/>
&gt;  true and if there is any mention of the order.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It will help me too since I have a 32 level Human<br/>

&gt;  &gt; I have a mage that is doing the pet focus item<br/>
&gt;  &gt; quests that are given by Vira<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Solusek&#39;s Eye, and  I have already turned in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; required items and<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; received my Stein of Ulissa. However, when I tried<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; to turn in the items for<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; my Broom of Trillion, Vira told me that Solusek Ro<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; did not accept half<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; measures, kept my items, and did not give me the<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; focus item.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; She evidently felt that I had somehow failed to<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; properly fulfill the quest,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet I am certain I gave her all the correct items.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; When offering her an item,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; the 4-slot trade-box opens with that item in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; first slot. Does it matter<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; what order the items are placed in the slots?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The other thing I wonder about is that after I<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; turned in my items and received <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; the stein, I talked to her about all of the other<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; focus quests. I do not<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; remember what order we discussed them, but could she<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; only be remembering the<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; last one we discussed and it was not for the broom?<br/>
