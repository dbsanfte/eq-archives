<b>Subject:</b> How the hell do I take someone off moderated status? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-84915043">There are a few people that have been posting well but it still has <br/>
them on moderated status and I cannot for the life of me find the <br/>
command in stupid yahoo to remove individual people from moderated <br/>
status. I have looked all through Management, Messages, Members, <br/>
Posting, etc and cannot find the bloody thing.<br/>
Yahoo&#39;s help page was not very helpful. It didn&#39;t say where to find the <br/>
option. UGH!<br/>
I apologize to the people who have been trying to post and have to <br/>
wait. It&#39;s pissing me off that I can&#39;t find the thing to unmoderate...<br/>
luv,<br/>
