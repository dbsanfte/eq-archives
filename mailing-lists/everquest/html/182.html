<div id="ygrps-yiv-240826246">Yes, survival is tough up there with a sharper breed of gnolls as well as orcs<br/>
of a greater spawn, not to mention the odd NPC that will have you for breakfast<br/>
if you are a follower of the wrong god.<br/>
<br/>
However i do belive a party of 5ths with a druid that can cast camo could make a<br/>
profitable ore and sharpening stone run.</div>
