EQ lives...................lol<br/>
<br/>
Ok How about this topic.<br/>
What do you all prefer..............(loaded question )<br/>
Unrest or High Pass and High Keep.<br/>
<br/>
I have played in both and like them a lot but I am not<br/>
sure which I prefer.  The issue I have with Unrest is<br/>
that the closest bind/sell point is Kaladim or<br/>
Kelethin for noncasters.<br/>
<br/>
I have also seen that Unrest drops some of the best or<br/>
most sought after stuff in the game. Most stuff I have<br/>
been looting is ok but I would not say Fantastic. <br/>
NOW...I am only level 19 Ranger and pulling from the<br/>
1st floor.  Does Unrest get better as you go up in<br/>
level?<br/>
<br/>
The thing I like about High Keep is that I can bank<br/>
there and bind there.<br/>
<br/>
Your thoughts appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Rob<br/>
