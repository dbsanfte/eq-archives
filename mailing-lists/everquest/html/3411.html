<div id="ygrps-yiv-196614589">Try also getting into a group in Velkator&#39;s(sp?) Labyrinth  Prolly the first<br/>
floor or the pit there will be good at 52.  I was in a group at the tent<br/>
there with my then 50 SK but it was only cause the guy leading the group<br/>
wanted me to level up higher and we had a 60 pally, 59 Cleric and 60 chanter<br/>
in group.  If you have Luclin then try getting a group in Maiden&#39;s Eye<br/>

  Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place to hunt<br/>
to<br/>
  get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>
  Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the other<br/>
  parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is there..<br/>
  does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I<br/>
will<br/>
  hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to<br/>
zone<br/>
  beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the<br/>
higher<br/>
  lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>
  Any suggestions?<br/>
  luv,<br/>
