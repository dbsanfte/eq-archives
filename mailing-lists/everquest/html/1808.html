<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-166455726">Well, I don&#39;t know much about melee myself either but I can say that <br/>
you can DS (Damage Shield) your hubby to power level him as well as <br/>
give him Skin Like Rock.  Also, buff him up with strength so he can <br/>
deal more damage.  I&#39;m really not sure if fearing is very effective <br/>
to PL because when I tried doing that, they didn&#39;t seem to get much <br/>
xp out of it.  Well, I can definitely help your hubby get to your <br/>
level if you&#39;re on Vazaelle.  I doubt it though.  Not many poeple <br/>
I&#39;ve seen online post that they&#39;re on vazaelle.  Cuz I can definitely <br/>
help him level.  I&#39;m a level 51 druid and I can use my 49 DS and <br/>
he&#39;ll kill mobs like they were nothing.  It deals 24 points of damage <br/>
each time the mob hits the person with the DS.<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering if some of you could help me.  I got my hubby <br/>
involved in EQ<br/>
&gt; so he&#39;d stop bugging me to get off the computer.  He&#39;s got a 10th <br/>
lvl<br/>
&gt; halfling fighter, and I know next to nothing about the melee <br/>
classes.<br/>
&gt; Assuming he&#39;s got about 1000pp to spend, what are his best choices <br/>
for armor<br/>
&gt; and a decent weapon.  He&#39;s got a fine steel longsword right now, <br/>
which seems<br/>
&gt; to suck, and leather armor.  Should he go to bronze or fine steel <br/>
armor?<br/>
&gt; What does a full suit of either of these cost?  And what&#39;s the best <br/>
weapon<br/>
&gt; for him at this point?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I&#39;m trying to powerlevel him just a little so we can go <br/>
adventuring<br/>
&gt; together, though I&#39;m not generally a fan of leveling people that <br/>
don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; what they&#39;re doing.  They should die plenty and learn like the rest <br/>
of us<br/>
&gt; did :P  I have a 16 druid and he just needs a couple of levels so <br/>
we can<br/>
&gt; hang out.  Is there a good place to do this quickly?  All I can <br/>
think of at<br/>
&gt; the moment is to fear kite lions and bears, oh my, and let him hack <br/>
them up.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s so darn many people in EC these days, though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
