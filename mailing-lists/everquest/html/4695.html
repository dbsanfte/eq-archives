<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612033335">Not sure about your sound question, but I had windows 95 and upgraded to<br/>
windows XP when SoL expansion hit and I have not had any problems and I have<br/>
a Sound Blaster Live, but I also don&#39;t have the music turned on. In regards<br/>
to the PoP and LoY Expansions - each of these expansions have some of the<br/>
best utilities in all of Everquest. I couldn&#39;t live without these utilities<br/>
ever again.<br/>
<br/>
The PoP has teleporting stones throughout all the lands. There is no real<br/>
need to wait on ports or even pay for a port unless these is no Plane of<br/>
Knowledge Stone anywhere around, 1 or 2 zones away. Levels 1 through 65 can<br/>
use the stones.<br/>
<br/>
The LoY expansion released on screen maps. You can zoom in and out. You can<br/>
look at all of Felwithe or just the platform and hut you are standing on.<br/>
All my maps have the name of the class GM listed where he is located. Really<br/>
no reason to get lost anymore. I would say 90% of the zones have maps. Maps<br/>
have succor locations. You can modify each zone map to mark key locations<br/>
and spawn points.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how long ago you played, but travel has been one of the very<br/>
low points for me. I can remember waiting on the boat in Butcher Block many<br/>
times, thinking there has to be a better way - this is not fun. Well travel<br/>
is longer a task that takes you forever. These 2 key EQ tools were well<br/>
worth the cash in and of itself in my onion. <br/>

problems.<br/>
<br/>
First I hope this group is for the PC version of Everquest. I quit <br/>
about a year and a half ago when I upgraded to Windows XP. I have a <br/>
Sound Blaster Live (value) card. I had the Shadows of Luclin <br/>
expansion.<br/>
<br/>
The sound effects and ambient sounds were good, but the music was <br/>
horribly distorted. I did the usual card driver updates with XP and <br/>
posted to the Vault and other fan sites. Others with XP and this <br/>
sound card had the same problem. EQ support emailed me back a <br/>
response that they were aware and were working on the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Before I consider coming back, I was wondering if anyone had similar <br/>
problems and were they solved with the current, new expansion I <br/>
believe is called &quot;Planes of Power&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hate to invest in the expansion to discover I still can&#39;t have <br/>
the music specific to areas within the zones. Any feedback would be <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
