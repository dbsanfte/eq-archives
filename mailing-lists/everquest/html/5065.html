<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845789923">Thanks for the responses. I do plan to go soon. I don&#39;t find much info<br/>
on EQ Atlas on Broken Skull. Maps, that&#39;s about it. Is it not drawing<br/>
much interest? Do we have too many places to go? Or are they just not<br/>
keeping the site updated?<br/>

&gt; Trouble is, I don&#39;t know how to get there. Granted, I haven&#39;t yet<br/>
&gt; tried, but when I look on some of the EQ sites I visit, I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; any way to get there. Is there a boat? From where? Is it even worth<br/>
&gt; going there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t even gone to Jagged Pines since we got a machine that makes<br/>
&gt; the zone playable. In fact, I need to visit lots of places. I have<br/>
&gt; only limited experience on Luclin due to the lag. Been working Crystal<br/>
&gt; Caverns this last week, my first week on the new machine.<br/>
