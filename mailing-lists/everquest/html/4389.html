<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-405555580">You might try the casters realm site to get the details and <br/>
strategies for your class. I haven&#39;t developed this class, so I don&#39;t <br/>
have any background to help.<br/>
<br/>
I do know the fear factor. Actually, that is one of the aspects of <br/>
this style of gaming that makes playing worthwhile. In console games, <br/>
your character and story line are generally created for you. If you <br/>
save often enough, trying something dangerous costs you nothing but <br/>
the time it takes to learn how to solve the puzzle or beat the boss.<br/>
<br/>
In this game, you invest time and effort to create your character. <br/>
You have an investment to protect. I know that I am cautious going <br/>
into new situations, not wanting to die and risk losing all that I <br/>
have invested. Sometimes the risk is just a corpse run. Sometimes you <br/>
can get yourself into a situation where you will need high-level help <br/>
to get out, and that help cannot always be found. <br/>
<br/>
The thrill of facing these risks, learning to overcome real danger, <br/>
and learning how to capitalize on every new situation is what makes <br/>
this game worth playing. You aren&#39;t just learning to twitch faster on <br/>
your controls. You think, plan, and design your own adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting to you.<br/>

&gt; I am new here, my sister recommended this group to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a question. I enjoy being an Enchantress because I am <br/>
looking <br/>
&gt; forward to some of the cool spells that I will eventually get <br/>
(Charm, <br/>
&gt; KEI, etc.) I just made Level 10 and am scared to death now because <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m afraid of getting killed, not being able to get back to my <br/>
&gt; corpse, and losing all my stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I joined a website that lists quests and the levels you can <br/>
complete <br/>
&gt; the quests at, the site says you can complete the Stein of Moggok <br/>
&gt; quest at level 8. I have components to make a Stein of Moggok, have <br/>
&gt; the book to get another Stein, but when I try to give bartender <br/>
Clurg <br/>
&gt; the book, his body guard knocks me on my butt. And I can&#39;t use the <br/>
&gt; Dark Elf Ill. spell until level 12, so why does everyone say that <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; can finish the quest at 8?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are there any other quests that low-level Enchantress&#39;s can do to <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; nice equipment, money and experience?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please help a lady out? Thanks much. </span></blockquote></div>
