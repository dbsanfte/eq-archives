 </span></blockquote>Not sure about end-game.. But I know that while Paladins are pretty good<br/>
tanks and can heal and rez people, shadowknights get spells that snare and<br/>
dot mobs. They also get pets to sick on mobs while they med. In terms of<br/>
being a flat out tank I think paladins might be better but don&#39;t know for<br/>
sure. I do know that my brother&#39;s shadowknight tends to deal more damage<br/>
than his paladin. So maybe a shadowknight might be better. Even without a<br/>
pet they are still tough. Darkelf shadowknights do pretty well. I think they<br/>
have lower str than humans but they can see in the dark and fit in small<br/>
spaces without shrink spells.<br/>
