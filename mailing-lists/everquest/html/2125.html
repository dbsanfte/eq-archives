<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Lag in zones <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-240802846">I have an AMD Athlon 1.4Ghz processor, Nvidia GeForce 2 MX 64Mb with TV out,<br/>
Philips PSC706 Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card, and 1.2Gb of RAM.<br/>
I haven&#39;t been into Rivervale since upgrading my RAM but I still experience<br/>
lag in other zones. Sometimes lag spikes hit and I go almost LD 5 times<br/>
before the lag stops and I can continue. But that usually coincides with a<br/>
couple of my group members actually going LD so I&#39;m pretty sure it is a<br/>
server side problem. I will take a character to Rivervale later and check it<br/>
out.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I just added the necessary memory to max out my system.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, that max is 256. I would love to go to 512 or more,<br/>
&gt; but that would require a new system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Things have improved with the added memory, but I still get lots of<br/>
&gt; lag in Rivervale, and similar town type zones. My graphics card is an<br/>
&gt; Nvidia TNT 64 (don&#39;t know what the 64 means, it is 32meg). It is the<br/>
&gt; best I could find last year for the money I had, and more than<br/>
&gt; adequate for the game at that time. I needed pci, so my choices were<br/>
&gt; a bit limited. More than that, my knowledge was much less in those<br/>
&gt; days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am curious as to what kinds of graphics cards people use, and<br/>
&gt; whether or not they are experiencing lag in zones like Rivervale in<br/>
&gt; spite of having a pretty good system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone have a killer rig, and still find lag or other problems? I<br/>
&gt; just wonder how much is the game, how much my now low end system.<br/>
