<div id="ygrps-yiv-589444768">Hello everyone I have question for you guys.  Now before I start off I am<br/>
just starting to learn the hardware side of computers so bear with me lol,<br/>
now my question is what items would be needed in order to have 3 computers<br/>
share 1 DSL line?  When I get back I&#39;m gonna buy a laptop and have one of my<br/>
friends move in with me so we&#39;ll have 3 computers total on 1 DSL line thats<br/>
the reason why I ask this question.  Thanks for any help you guys can give<br/>
