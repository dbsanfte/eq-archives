&gt; four-port router from Linksys or D-Link in most shops that sell computer<br/>
&gt; hardware, and they&#39;re not too pricey. Configuration shouldn&#39;t be too<br/>
&gt; difficult, as a lot of consumer routers come with an installation CD that<br/>
&gt; will help users to configure their computers and the router to share an<br/>
&gt; Internet connection.<br/>
