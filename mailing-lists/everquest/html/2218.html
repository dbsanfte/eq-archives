<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456440185">ok you guys i need some help. I started a Dark Elf Shadow Knight <br/>
yesterday. Everyone says i picked a bad combination and they are <br/>
extremely hard to play with, but thats why i picked it. Anyways I <br/>
need me some armor and a good weapon. Can one of you ppl that know <br/>
alot about the game, suggest me a good weapon and a good fix on armor <br/>
within the range of 100pp for the weapon and 100pp for the armor? I&#39;d <br/>
really appreciate it. Right now I have Kodiak claws that hit for 9 <br/>
dmg. They are pretty quick too, and only weight 1.0. So please if you <br/>
are gonna suggest a weapon plz suggest one better than that. My body <br/>
armor is 15ac too, so don&#39;t really have to suggest body armor.... <br/>
Well, thank ya lots, peace.<br/>
<br/>
Ohh by the way, I forgot to mention in my last post, I play on <br/>
Bristlebane.... Jaspher...<br/>
