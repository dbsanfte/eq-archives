Subject: [EverQuest] Lost in translation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thanks to everyone for helping me to learn how to create and configure<br/>
&gt; spare chat screens. Now someone has thrown me another mystery to<br/>
solve. A<br/>
&gt; player sent me the following words:<br/>
&gt; &quot;Link your wep pls?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Ok. I figured out that a wep is a weapon. When I asked him what he<br/>
meant,<br/>
&gt; he said that he wanted to link with my hammer. I have an Intel&#39;s<br/>
Hammer.<br/>
&gt; However, I have no idea what he means by linking him to it or how to<br/>
do it.<br/>
&gt; Somebody please throw this poor newbe a clue. G. I&#39;m playing a level<br/>
24 vah<br/>
&gt; shir shaman. Great goddess, there is something totally new to learn<br/>
&gt; everything I log on.<br/>

If you hold down the ALT key while clicking on an item it will open up a<br/>
persistent window describing its stats. If you then click on the icon of<br/>
the item that appears in this window (the top right corner of the<br/>
window), it will paste a hot-link with the name of the item into your<br/>
chat bar at the current cursor location. You can use this procedure to<br/>
pass a hot-link to other people, who can then click on the link (the<br/>
name of the item) on their screen, which will then open up the items<br/>
description window on their computer.<br/>
<br/>
You can have up to 4 item windows open at once, subsequent items will<br/>
replace the contents of the 4th window opened.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
You will often notice item names appearing in different colour to the<br/>
surrounding text as you play (they updated the loot message to use these<br/>
hotlinks too). If you click on the highlighted text you will see the<br/>
item window, with all the stats for that item.<br/>
