<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363191889"><p>Ah, I wasn&#39;t aware there were differences with the Gold Edition. I started off with the Classic EQ and Kunark-together edition, then bought all the expansions seperately as they came out. (Finally got LoY last night). Makes for a lot of CDs to keep up with. :D

I just got into all of this last week. I bought the <br>expansion pack first because I liked the kitties. Then I bought the <br>Everquest Trilogy so that I could use the expansion pack. G. I have <br>no regrets. My only complaint is that I can&#39;t stop playing once I <br>start. I love this game.<br><br>Edward<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com/">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
