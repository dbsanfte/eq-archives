<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-717403238">Thank you for the input. I will try all that out.<br/>
<br/>
I think I am going to build a new char. I did something dumb. I went <br/>
to high pass hold. I am now lvl 17--soon to be 16--just trying to <br/>
recover my corpse. I figure once I get to low of lvl to even get <br/>
inside high pass to get to my corpse, good time to build a new char. <br/>
with better abilities. Sad to see all that work go to nothing though.<br/>
This hef rgr seems to be a little retarded and handicapped. Too many <br/>
blunt hits to the head I guess... lol :?))<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a gnome so I can learn tinkering. That sounds like fun.<br/>
