<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have been in the Dreadlands and it isn&#39;t so bad, 
I haven&#39;t had much trouble finding groups as a ranger because we have SOW and 
there aren&#39;t many druids or shaman around usually. I have been asked to tank and 
pull occasionally which is alright, but I prefer a warrior, shadowknight or monk 
to pull whenever possible, they just seem better at it, tracking is kind of 
useless in a crowded zone as whatever you are tracking might be taken by another 
player or group.</font></div>

  my <br>&gt; druid. I will be needing Brute hides, and so was ready to go and 
  <br>hunt <br>&gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never met the 
  boat. I <br>&gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and they went 
  out to <br>&gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the boat left. The 
  <br>&gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That avenue being 
  out, I returned to SK to pick off gnolls, and <br>&gt; forage Plains Pebbles. 
  I almost have my bank tool box full of them. <br>&gt; have about eight to go. 
  So, decided to stay there until I get the <br>&gt; rest.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Plus 
  I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls, which I have <br>&gt; tried to 
  make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hope they get the 
  boat fixed. For my first trip I want to do it the <br>&gt; old-fashioned 
  way.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br><br>I&#39;ve found the big boat to FV to 
  be broken too.&nbsp; Luckily I have a <br>friend that&#39;s a Druid so I got a 
  port to the DL.&nbsp; I tried to petition <br>the GM but it doesn&#39;t work if 
  there isn&#39;t one on!<br><br>Kunark is a dangerous place for the good 
  races.&nbsp; The only place you <br>can bind a good melee is in FV and it&#39;s 
  surrounded by mid-level <br>mobs.&nbsp; If you port over you end up in the DL, 
  which is ok, it&#39;s just <br>getting out of there that&#39;s the problem!&nbsp; The 
  DL does have <br>connections to the FM and FV if you know where to look.&nbsp; 
  It&#39;s not a <br>place to be without a map!<br><br>And I am also looking for a 
  place to take me to the mid-40&#39;s.&nbsp; I&#39;ve <br>been to the moon, Kunark, the 
  Karanas and Velious.&nbsp; I like to go to <br>the zones that have been 
  abandoned, like all the dungones on <br>Anatonica.&nbsp; I&#39;m in the FM now and 
  will probably be in the DL, like <br>everyone else. <br><br>Tuldayen
