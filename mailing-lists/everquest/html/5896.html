<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-248486036">Greetings....<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing EQ for a long time, played nearly every class <br/>
with most races. I feel I am knowledgeable about many things in <br/>
regards to each class, race, etc. Yet, there is the one question <br/>
that evades me.. For the &quot;Knight&quot; classes, (Shadowknights and <br/>
Paladins), what is better..the traditional 1hs or the 2hs. I have <br/>
seen people, including my friends who do 2hs, and some that do 1hs. <br/>
What are the pros and cons of each...so I can decide which way to go <br/>
with my new pally...<br/>
<br/>
thanks</div>
