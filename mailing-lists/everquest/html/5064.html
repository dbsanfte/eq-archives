<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006167555">You&#39;re missing a lot by not going to Broken Skull.  I spend a lot of <br/>
time in Dulak and now Nadox.  The models are great and the loot is <br/>
good.  Most of the charms have a component in Dulak or Gunthak.  You <br/>
gotta go.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, touch the doors on the boat and you&#39;re in Gunthak.  Run across <br/>
the water to the beach.  From there are tunnels to Dulak or Nadox.  <br/>
Anyone from 35 to 65 can something to do.<br/>

&gt; Trouble is, I don&#39;t know how to get there. Granted, I haven&#39;t yet<br/>
&gt; tried, but when I look on some of the EQ sites I visit, I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; any way to get there. Is there a boat? From where? Is it even worth<br/>
