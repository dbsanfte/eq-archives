Iksar.  The language barrier is tuff for the 1st few<br/>
lvs but you can emote in common. I head to pok and<br/>
emoted the fact I wish I could speak Human or elvish<br/>
the 2 most common tongues and people will group then<br/>
spam you in no time your a master.  Later in groups<br/>
people of other races are more than happy to exchange<br/>
lessons with ya during med time.  Some will not let me<br/>
in a group because of your race, that is fine I dont<br/>
need the help of the softskins anyway. The roleplay is<br/>
fun tho.  In general people are pretty nice and<br/>
dedicated there the trivial thing does bite. <br/>
