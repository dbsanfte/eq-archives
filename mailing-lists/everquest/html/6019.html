<div><font size="2"></font><br><font size="2">Yea I group regularly with a chanter 
friend of mine and I&#39;ve witnessed how much aggro she gets, especially when she 
has to mez some creatures on a bad pull.&nbsp; Thankfully most tanks I have 
grouped with learn very fast how to get it back from her, also I&#39;ve become quite 
good at pulling mobs off her onto me till tank gets aggro again (or wants 
aggro.)&nbsp; I&#39;ve even kept one spell slot for my best heal so I can fire off 
some quick rounds her way to keep her from getting low health aggro.&nbsp; Not 
to say shes an aggro magnet, but she has learned how to kite mobs with her 
chanter till either I or the tank can get it more upset with us again, although 
lately shes gotten better at using that Rune shield to keep herself from getting 
hit till we get its attention.&nbsp; Usually if the tanks a warrior thanks to 
those new disicplines she doesnt draw as much aggro and paladins have those stun 
spells that really work well.&nbsp; Had rangers tank a few times but they really 
didnt seem to do as well on aggro management (but the one that tanked for us on 
several occasions is teamed with a druid and they usually kite mobs.)&nbsp; My 
chanter friend and I have duoed a few areas for xp, using her slows and such 
with my pet tanking and me on heals (yes my gimpy little beast heals...not like 
shes got tons of HPs anyway *smile*) and done very well in older zones, but if 
we try the newer zones (GoD, OoW) then we need a good healer.&nbsp; One thing to 
remember, try to make some friends who play same times you do and try to work 
into a regular group, had so many times our group was saved by her remaining 
cool under powerful attacks and getting them mezzed followed by me pulling them 
off her (once we were accused of being a hydra team.)&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen bad tanks 
and super tanks, some bad tanks I even knew weren&#39;t really bad tanks, they just 
had someone in the group used to a tank with higher aggro abilities (he had 
decided the tank was worthless since he didnt own some expensive weapon with 
mega aggro ability...like everyone has dozens of K of plat just waiting to be 
spent.)&nbsp; We found really quick all we had to do was delay how often we used 
our abilities and tanks would often be able to&nbsp;keep the aggro better (but 
then again was one tank who not only couldnt keep aggro well the chanter made a 
better tank than he did.)&nbsp; As for aggro magnets...chanter friend of mine is 
finally losing her &quot;group sacifice&quot; title since I&#39;m now better at getting them 
off her till tank gets them again.&nbsp; Mean time my beast is now quickly 
becoming a tank himself, but dont count on the cleric or druid having much mana 
when done...beasts are not really ment for damage input, just damage output

        <div>it&#39;s getting so pitiful with some wars when&nbsp;I&#39;m playing my 
        chanter i stand right next to them to cast at least that way they don&#39;t 
        have to chase the mob to taunt it all they have to do is turn a little, 
        and as I&#39;m usually grouped with guildies the healer already has me on 
        target when they pull.... and it&#39;s getting so&nbsp;I&#39;ll only group in 
        BoT when&nbsp;I&#39;m on my beast&nbsp;with a healer i know cause&nbsp;half 
        the time&nbsp;if I&#39;m using Sha&#39;s Revenge I&#39;m going to get my behind
