<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752056159">Ah, there will always be a rant from those dedicated to preserving all<br/>
the good and gracious in a language. They are to be held in high regard.<br/>
<br/>
There will always be those who will have fun with language, and cause<br/>
it to evolve in new and interesting ways. Especially with these new<br/>
developments in communications. Their courage and spirit is to be admired.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage both views, for without some restraint, a mutating<br/>
language will cease to do what it must. Communicate. Without change<br/>
over time, a language will stagnate and no longer relate to the world<br/>
as it is.<br/>
<br/>
As I straddle my polyphonic fence, I can enjoy the richness of both<br/>
sides. The joy of lex is a form of masturbation, but usually won&#39;t get<br/>
you into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Words are fun to play with. Quite affordable, and such a delight.<br/>
