<b>Subject:</b> Ports to Luclin <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988376448">So, how long have we druids had the ports to Luclin? I just heard <br/>
about it, learned that the spells were in my home of Rivervale, and <br/>
bought all I could use. Just wondered if this was very new, or if I <br/>
simply have had my head up my backside. Hadn&#39;t seen the vendor <br/>
before. In the back of the druid&#39;s guild in Rivervale.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone familiar with the Twilight Sea? Since I can port right there, <br/>
to the island of the elementals, I was wondering if it would be nuts <br/>
to try to solo there at lvl 33? Nice drops from those elementals, but <br/>
I may try to get a group up if the solo thing is not workable.<br/>
