<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854720900">Yep, that should be it. I don&#39;t know if thats the main one but I did <br/>
like that one alot. All I can say is that the guys at SOE and ILM <br/>
(Assuming they are the ones that made this) have way to much fun and <br/>
time on their hands!<br/>
<br/>
(Regarding Leeroy...)<br/>
LOL At first I was like whats with all the numbers and stuff, who cares? <br/>
And then Leeroy takes off out of the blue and just his battle cry alone <br/>
was too funny!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which I almost did a LJ last night by pure accident. We were <br/>
over in GD and I ran up and almost into the frost giant castle which ov <br/>
course would have trained all of them knowing my luck!<br/>
<br/>
LOL<br/>
