<div id="ygrps-yiv-703709192"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; hello everyone.. I am new to this club but not EQ..  Lets talk about<br/>
&gt; makeing money.. I know to kill giants and farm silks and hides to<br/>
&gt; make money and you make god money doing this.. But how the heck do<br/>
&gt; people make 100k and more lol.. most i have had at one time is 5k..<br/>
&gt; If there is a better way to make pp  please let me know  thanks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Basically farming and doing lost dungeon adventures is pretty profitable. I<br/>
myself am not good at making money yet. I need to work on it. I&#39;m hoping to<br/>
be able to profit from my jewelcraft when I get it high enough. I had to get<br/>
it high to work on my 7th shawl. If you have a foraging class, you can make<br/>
coin foraging stuff to sell.<br/>
Anyone know of good websites that have money making advice (not the pay<br/>
sites)?<br/>
luv,<br/>
