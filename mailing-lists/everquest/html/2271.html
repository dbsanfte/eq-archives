<div id="ygrps-yiv-132963404">I was checking the list and thought i&#39;d add my two cents to this <br/>
subject line :)<br/>
<br/>
I play a shaman, i just hit level 18 two nights ago (^_^). Ive paid <br/>
for a tp myself, sometimes more than usual to get out of a place i <br/>
just cant stand (like yesterday.. i was hunting in Lake of Ill Omen <br/>
and someone was doing a raid for their monk epic, and everyone was <br/>
shouting and /oocing and even /auctioning and when i asked them to <br/>
tone it down to one channel because not everyone in the zone was on <br/>
the raid, i was rudely told to shut up and the less i whined the <br/>
faster they would be done) or if im despreate and someone&#39;s switched <br/>
characters just to port me somewhere.  On the SoW part of the idea, i <br/>
think that taking a donation for a sow is all right, like when you&#39;re <br/>
in the middle of a fight and someone comes up asking for one,  or if <br/>
your in a group and really low on mana and someone comes up and wants <br/>
one, or when all you hear is &quot;can i have sow?&quot; &lt;cast spell&gt; &quot;ooh! <br/>
shes casting sow!!&quot; &lt;the whole durn zone comes running over&gt; &quot;can i <br/>
have sow?&quot;  I finally put my character on Roleplay mode (full anon is <br/>
not allowed by my guild) so people wouldnt ask me as often.  <br/>
Occasionally i have the random &quot;you are being inspected&quot; and then i <br/>
get asked for it (my weapon is shm only so its kind of a giveaway if <br/>
you know my wep), and ill always cast it for corpse runs for people.  <br/>
<br/>
A slightly different subject now... Can anyone suggest a good surname <br/>
for my shammie?  Her name&#39;s Lorecie, at the rate im going i&#39;ll be 20 <br/>
by the end of the month and i want a surname hehehe.  Also am looking <br/>
for suggestions for my fiancee (both in game and real life) for his <br/>
characer... so i&#39;ll be taking his surname on soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions and my random ranting about the jerks in <br/>
LoIO.<br/>

&gt; &gt;to me. Sure, I sometimes get stiffed and sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt;get something I can&#39;t use as a tip, but for the most<br/>
&gt; &gt;part I think I have been well rewarded. For me <br/>
&gt; &gt;it is in character and adds to the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think i&#39;m coming to the conclusion that a Druid<br/>
&gt; should less demand payment for a TP, than players<br/>
&gt; should feel that the right thing to do is to donate<br/>
&gt; what they can for one. :) As someone who&#39;s taken quite<br/>
&gt; a few, I always make sure I have the standard 10pp<br/>
&gt; available to offer, it&#39;s just the right thing to do<br/>
&gt; for the investment of time being given for the other<br/>
&gt; player. I don&#39;t think i&#39;d stand there once my druid<br/>
&gt; can group TP and demand payment, but watching that<br/>
&gt; twinked level 12 with better equipment than I have go<br/>
&gt; on about how broke he is might be a little hard to<br/>
&gt; swallow.<br/>
