How else are they going to keep the person who stole the account from giving<br/>
all of the rightful owner&#39;s gear away?  If they ban it so he can&#39;t play it,<br/>
then he can&#39;t strip the characters.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Verant&#39;s new security policy..<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think of this? Verant says the investigations on compromised<br/>
accounts take away too much time for the GMs to do customer support, so now<br/>
they are just going to ban all accounts that are compromised.. That&#39;s what I<br/>
call really f-in BAD customer support.. It&#39;s like an insurance.. Knowing<br/>
that if someone steals your car, or breaks into it and steal your brand new<br/>
Lodizal Shell Stereo, the insurance company will help you out and cough up a<br/>
new one for you.. Verant sux! Maybe they could charge a fee like the<br/>
insurance companies do, from people whos accounts have been compromised in<br/>
order to investigate and rectify the situation, but BAN THEM? That is SO<br/>
F-IN WRONG!<br/>
