<div id="ygrps-yiv-799712392">RE: [EverQuest] zoningYou haven&#39;t been reading closely..<br/>
<br/>
I saw a post from soneone once who said he had a Pentium2 300 Mhz with 128MB with a cable modem and it takes him about 5-10 seconds to load.  I have a Pentium2 with 300Mhz and 128MB and a V.90 modem and it takes me 30 seconds to load.  The only difference between our two rigs is his cable modem.  He zones 3 to 6 times faster.<br/>
<br/>
The Swedish post said he took less than a minute.  I&#39;ll read that as 50 seconds not 5 to ten.  That&#39;s almost twice as slow as me.  He said he has and AMD K6 300 Mhz - didn&#39;t mention memory - so either he has less memory than me - or it&#39;s the additional hops from Sweden than the US.<br/>
<br/>
Another example:<br/>
?have a amd 400mhz 64mb of ps100 ram   16mb video card-banshee<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and an awesome creative 128bit sound card. however i have NEVER zoned in<br/>
&gt;less than a minute, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is faster than my machine, but less memory - zones slower than me - looks like memory is an issue too!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is BOTH bandwidth AND system speed dependent.<br/>

  How can it be dependent on bandwidth..  my brother has a p3 450 with a 28.8 connetion.. he loads faster than me using a p2-333.  and the guy from sweden only takes 8-10 secs. to load..  i think Shane had an interesting comment..  how much extra drive space do you have.. i remember that the installation instructions stated that there is a requirement for a minnimum of 150 mb.  Any load times about 30sec between zones is highly unusal. Youve got a problem that goes beyond our disscusion.  Like i said before the data that is sent to your machine at anytime is quite compact and requires very little transfer time. Its system dependent when reference to load times.. <br/>

  It must be dependant on bandwidth more than anything else.  I have a similar <br/>
  computer as below: 350 128 meg 16 meg video with a cable modem.  I zone in <br/>
  about 8 - 10 seconds. <br/>

  &gt;Hiya <br/>
  &gt;  i have a amd 400mhz 64mb of ps100 ram   16mb video card-banshee <br/>
  &gt;and an awesome creative 128bit sound card. however i have NEVER zoned in <br/>
  &gt;less than a minute, usually more, i know a lot of it is processor <br/>
  &gt;i have hit zones withgroups and i am the last one to wake up so to speak <br/>
  &gt;the others had p2 350mhz etc  i do have a 33.6 modem so i think it is <br/>
  &gt;the modem connection that makes the biggest difference, i wish my work <br/>
  &gt;computer had a cd rom drive installed, its just a p266 with 80mb but the <br/>
  &gt;45kps T1 connection would surely be nice as opposed to my <br/>
  &gt;3.5 to about 4.0kps i get with my 33.6 modem. does anyone out there <br/>
  &gt;play on a recommended p200 or above system req and use a T1? <br/>
  &gt;i wold love to know the zone times ya get:) <br/>
