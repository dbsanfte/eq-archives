<div id="ygrps-yiv-389818881">You should also hold on to pixie dust. there are two quests for it. One for<br/>
the rangers and one for the rogues.<br/>
There is also a quest in the warrior guild where you bring the guy a bat<br/>
fur, a bonechip, a spiderline eye, and a ruined wolf pelt. He gives you a<br/>
random item. sometimes armor or a gem that sells for a decent price. But you<br/>
have to have killed enough orcs to have good faction with him to do the<br/>
quest. Hail him and he will give you the quest. I wish I could remember his<br/>
name... he&#39;s in the place accross from the store that sells fletching stuff.<br/>
Pixies drop decent loot sometimes too. And there is the mail delivery quest<br/>
from Felwithe to Kelethin. Sometimes the guy you deliver mail to gives you<br/>
up to 5gp. I wish I could remember the name but my brain is just dead right<br/>
now.<br/>

&gt; (now on Fennin) was lucky enough to get two hatchets<br/>
&gt; in her travels this weekend...This is great news and i<br/>
&gt; will do as you have suggested...i have been hanging<br/>
&gt; around the lifts but have now made lvl 5 (all by<br/>
&gt; myself..WOOT)and will have to move on soon i think..no<br/>
&gt; more safety of knowing the guards there...lol...Gosh i<br/>
&gt; never knew i could have so much fun alone...is alot<br/>
&gt; easier because i am not frustrating the BF who has<br/>
&gt; been playing the game for a long time and cannot<br/>
&gt; understand why i sometimes just &quot;don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; it&quot;...pffffffff...my thanks to all of you here who<br/>
&gt; have been such a HUGE help...Anyone on Fennin???? :-)<br/>
