<div id="ygrps-yiv-95291783">I&#39;ve actually left camps where I was farming when lower lvl people came<br/>
around and wanted to hunt there. I don&#39;t like to fight over spawns with<br/>
people. I will buff them up and tell them to holler for me if they need help<br/>
if I&#39;m still in zone. I would do horribly on PVP bc I would rather make<br/>
people happy and help out than compete.<br/>

It&#39;s true, some people are real jerks.  If I need to farm silks with my<br/>
58 druid and I see a bunch of low-levels fighting spiders for exp,<br/>
I try to buy the silks.  I will do something else before I KS,<br/>
especially a Baron to a level 10, that is extremely asinine.</div>
