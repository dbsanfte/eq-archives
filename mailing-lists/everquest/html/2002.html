<div id="ygrps-yiv-287908515">If you would like to include one example of why, what aspect of the Vah Shir<br/>
model requires DirectX 8.1 I would be happy to accept your line of<br/>
reasoning.  In fact other then the fact that each model requires a more<br/>
capable video card to handle, what aspect of them requires anything other<br/>
then DirectX 7.  Sorry don&#39;t buy your argument.<br/>
<br/>
Sure it&#39;s easy to put some fault on Microsoft. Key is they no longer support<br/>
Windows 95 at all.  That includes any further DirectX API updates so anyone<br/>
that has Windows 95, you no longer own a system that can run any NEW games<br/>
now that DX8 has been released.  To say a company need to continue to<br/>
provide support for an OS that is no longer supported by its own creator<br/>
(especially in the gaming world) is somewhat laughable.  If you can come up<br/>
with one game out there that supports concurrent multiple version of DirectX<br/>
other then downward compatibility, list one for me.<br/>
<br/>
* there is a section.. A small vocal section of the EQ community that are<br/>
not true computer gamers in the sense.  They simply bought a computer one<br/>
day without the knowledge that some day I will need to buy a new one, or<br/>
upgrade the one I have now.  They found EQ or someone turn them onto it and<br/>
became addicted.  Now they are tossing their hands in the air and scratching<br/>
their heads.  Anyone that actually is familiar with the gaming community<br/>
knows the trends and has absolutely no problem with Luclin.*  *funny no-one<br/>
in my guild (which includes mostly couples, and friends )are complaining<br/>
about the requirements* Sure you might have to upgrade your system - but its<br/>
not rocket science, nor will it break the bank.<br/>
<br/>
Could you sight anywhere that says people don&#39;t want new graphics, and<br/>
player models that update their characters to those comparable, if not<br/>
better then those found in any other graphics based MMORPG.  If you like<br/>
MUDDs fine stick with them... However everyone here that has Luclin and its<br/>
new graphic enhancements by far have been impressed and think their great.<br/>
Sorry I find it hard to believe in your argument.<br/>
<br/>
And your reference to ORIGIN.. Origin started out good.  Then they created a<br/>
boatload of crappy games, and released a total bomb of a film to the<br/>
theater.  They alienated their customers with poor games and bad<br/>
investments.  I don&#39;t know how many millions of dollars they spend on the<br/>
last Wing Commander.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I fail to see why loyal customers of up to three years should be punished<br/>
for not having an interest in the expansion though.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again.. What aspect of the new cat model requires DX8.  You seem to forget<br/>
the whole world engine was updated.  That goes beyond the added looks the<br/>
player models and world landscape.  It&#39;s the underlining graphical<br/>
programming interface.  The engine runs so much faster now ( apart from a<br/>
handful of buggy zones atm ).  Aye if ya like MUDDS feel free to enjoy them<br/>
again.  I&#39;m a gamer and enjoy innovations/imaginations of those that create<br/>
them.  Well, there&#39;s always Ultima Online for you to fall back on ;) <br/>

&gt;It has nothing to do with a low res version of Vah<br/>
&gt;Shir model.  In fact that is in the game now.  With<br/>
&gt;the SoL expansion you can set it on a low res version<br/>
&gt;of the entire game or high if you choose to  that<br/>
&gt;includes both game world and player models ).  The<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has everything to do with the lack of an old Vah<br/>
Shir model, which seems to be Verant&#39;s only<br/>
justification for requiring everyone to update to<br/>
DirectX 8.1 instead of having a dual standard of &quot;if<br/>
you want the new graphics/want to play Luclin,<br/>
update&quot;. There has been no enhancements (at least to<br/>
my knowledge) of the pre-luclin graphics aside from<br/>
the new character models all of which can be disabled<br/>
except for the Vah Shir model. By allowing users to<br/>
get by with an older version of DirectX, older video<br/>
cards are still acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;whole problem here is when Microsoft made a majority<br/>
&gt;of video cards obsolete with the release of directx<br/>
&gt;8.. PERIOD...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Argued that one ages ago, not inclined to go back.<br/>
Microsoft bashing is easy, Verant chose to push to a<br/>
higher hardware/software standard than their customer<br/>
base was ready to support, again I point to Origin as<br/>
an example of what that tends to cause. If anyone<br/>
recalls they were among the largest gaming companies<br/>
in the industry in their heyday, and systematically<br/>
destroyed their customer base with increasing hardware requirements. Sure<br/>
the games looked great, but only a tenth of the market could play &#39;em. :P<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;problem.  Do you see any other company even<br/>
&gt;attempting to release a updated DirectX 8 version?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When they have an established customer base, much of<br/>
whom are using DX8 incompatable video cards? Nope,<br/>
Verant appears to be the only one. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You will, however, never see a DirectX 9 version...<br/>
&gt;Nor will they be supporting the same program 3 years<br/>
&gt;from now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You seem to forget that a significant portion of the<br/>
EQ community doesn&#39;t want these &quot;improvements&quot;.<br/>
Graphically the game was just fine, beyond what was<br/>
necessary to get the point across. (of course, i&#39;m the<br/>
type who still plays MUDs on occasion :) A few pretty<br/>
new graphics do not justify alienating a significant<br/>
chunk of your customer base. (there was already more<br/>
than enough worldspace and &quot;phat l00tz&quot; in game,<br/>
*VERY* few have explored every nook and cranny of<br/>
Velious and Kunark, nevermind the original worldspace)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hehe.. Computer technology changes every few<br/>
&gt;months.. If your still using the same computer you<br/>
&gt;had 3 years ago, its probably time to upgrade.  Ah<br/>
&gt;well.. Its Christmas :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lol, well, I personally don&#39;t have any problems<br/>
meeting the reqs aside from the RAM and fortunately<br/>
i&#39;m in a position to fix that. (well, at least once I<br/>
get my puter back, damn FedEx :( I fail to see why<br/>
loyal customers of up to three years should be<br/>
punished for not having an interest in the expansion<br/>
though. This is totally ignoring the astounding and<br/>
absolutely brutal bugs that still existed after the<br/>
release date, Luclin is a rather shoddy product from<br/>
that perspective, and obviously should have been held<br/>
back a month or two at least. Amusingly enough, it<br/>
seems like Verant&#39;s own slogan seems to sum up their<br/>
attitude &quot;You&#39;re in our world now b*tch.&quot; :P<br/>
