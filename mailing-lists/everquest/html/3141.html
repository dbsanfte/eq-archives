<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341695818">Kewl thanks for the info.  I had need of a cpouple of coffins this past<br/>
weekend when a friend of mine who is lvl 11 somehow managed to fall to the<br/>
3rd level in Befallen and he didnt know how to get to his corpse.  I wound<br/>
up having to call on a necro in the guild to use the Summon Corpse spell she<br/>
had since I didnt know where to get the coffins.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW what is the name of the coffins I need for the lesser summon corpse<br/>
spell that we SK have?<br/>
<br/>
As for PoM I&#39;ve yet to go  on any raid to any of the planes.  There wsa one<br/>
person on the Saryn server that was having open PLanes raids but from what I<br/>
understand she quit having them when she finlly got a guild to back her up<br/>
on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

&gt; The easiest place to buy coffins is on the moon, in the bazaar zone. The<br/>
&gt; first merchant next to the bank sells them. He sells both kinds, stackable<br/>
&gt; and non-stackable coffins. I just had to buy a couple yesterday :-( Some<br/>
&gt; guild members do not listen about pushing mobs through the wall, I was<br/>
&gt; tanking a flurry drake in NToV and it got pushed through the wall and it<br/>
&gt; summon myself and 2 others. Since I was bound in bazaar and the corpse&#39;s<br/>
&gt; were now almost to the Plane of Mischief zone, they had to be summoned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, has anyone else been to the PoM zone before? Some card drops are<br/>
&gt; dropped at a ridiculous rate.<br/>
