<div id="ygrps-yiv-460770977">Greetings All,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   I have a question to all you woodland elves out there.  Woodelves have the<br/>
born-with-skill to Hide.  However, when I was watching them play with<br/>
Hide (they were lvl4-6), I could still see them.  On their screen they were<br/>
hidden and they can nolonger see their character, but I can see them plainly.<br/>
<br/>
  Once in awhile I see them disappear, but most of the time I still see them<br/>
even though they said they got the message &quot;you are hidden&quot; and they can<br/>
no longer see themselves in any camera view.  <br/>
<br/>
  Is this a bug, are they doing something wrong, or do Humans have a chance<br/>
of seeing them even though they are hidden from other eyes?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
