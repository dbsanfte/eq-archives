<div id="ygrps-yiv-488825726">Definetly ditch ME. Every techie I have talked to has told me how unstable<br/>
it is. They say that Win2000 is much more stable. XP is also an option. Not<br/>
as stable as 2000 and not compatible with alot of software. and you have to<br/>
go into regedit and edit Permissions to allow yourself to install software<br/>
on it. It is a real biyatch sometimes.<br/>

   I have  to agree there 2 GB of ram my system can handle 1.5 gb but my<br/>
OS(win ME) won&#39;t handle that so well by the way SU my Geforce 4 card is also<br/>
64 MB I couldn&#39;t afford the 128 mb card</div>
