<div id="ygrps-yiv-371878718">Some basic ideas for a mid-high (but not uber) chanty....Shai&#39;din Ceremonial<br/>
Dagger, Gloves of Penitance, Book of Impracticality, Masterful Gold Chain<br/>
Necklace, Silken Turban of Serfdom, Discordant Silk Bracer, Steelslave<br/>
Surgeon&#39;s Robe. All of thse items aim for a strong balance bt int, raw mana,<br/>
and cha.<br/>
<br/>
At 44, Camenae (my Dark Elf chanty) has had her int maxed for about 7<br/>
levels, and cha of 240 with most of her gear still needing to mature. Once<br/>
she gets 55 or so, even with no gear changes she&#39;ll easily cap. I did throw<br/>
a couple of Radiantcut Skyflows her way to help things along, but prolly 50+<br/>
to 60 they&#39;ll be mostly wasted as her gear matures but her cap remains low.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any of the token cha-only, no int/mana gear I see a lot of<br/>
chanters use, tho I did use a 12 cha 12 dex ring for a few levels til I<br/>
could use a Glowing Magma Ring and toss another aug in to bring the cha back<br/>
up.  I do have a few &quot;lower end&quot; items on her, such as a bracer from LS<br/>
that&#39;s matured by 10, but again, it was chosen for the balance of the stats.<br/>
<br/>
At 44, she has 2.7k mana pool, 2.1k hps, and has pulled my ass outta the<br/>
fire more times than I can count...mezzes land very reliably and mana is<br/>
plentiful. Now if only Discordant Mind was resisted less....<br/>
