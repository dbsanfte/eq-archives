<b>Subject:</b> Okay...new term (to me) de-levelling? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073193775">I was wandering around Oasis w/ my 13 bard and my groupmate (higher than<br/>
me) hot jumped by someone approximately his level (around 14-15), and he<br/>
said his attacker was &quot;de-leveled&quot; because of the amount of damage he did.<br/>
Do you not lose your skill levels when you lose a level?</div>
