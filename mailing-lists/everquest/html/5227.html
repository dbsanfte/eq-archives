<b>Subject:</b> Reward in LDoN?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-456368458">Hello all I&#39;m finally on my way home after a long 8 and a half month<br/>
deployment and on one of our stops I was able to pick up LDoN at a local<br/>
computer store.  So once I buy it right away I open it up and read it.  Well<br/>
it says that since I bought the retail LDoN I&#39;ll get a reward..does anyone<br/>
know what it is..or does it vary depending on the rune?  Just wondering and<br/>
thanks for any help.  Happy Hunting!<br/>
