EQ-Toolbox is now carrying the LDoN maps.  They are very helpful, as <br/>
are the rest of zones.  But EQAtlas is still the best resource for <br/>
what is in the zone, and where.  He doesn&#39;t update it anymore but he <br/>
does take submissions.<br/>

I&#39;ve tried the hunt the area idea and get nothing on my maps.  Even <br/>
though I&#39;ve spent days in a zone, and in my younger days weeks!  <br/>

&gt; &gt; LOL So far it seems ok. I&#39;ve had to redo a few of my<br/>
&gt; &gt; keys but other than<br/>
&gt; &gt; that everything else is cool, I do like the map<br/>
&gt; &gt; feature though! That is<br/>
&gt; &gt; really going to be helpful, though do I have all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; maps or do I need to<br/>
&gt; &gt; explore an area to gain them?<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t checked it in a while, but eqtoolbox.com use<br/>
&gt; to have maps to most, if not all, the zones out there<br/>
&gt; for download. Might want to check it out. ;)<br/>
