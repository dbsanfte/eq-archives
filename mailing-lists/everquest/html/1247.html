<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629826986">I agree completely!<br/>
I play a cleric and a shaman and nearly always get shafted when it comes to<br/>
looting.  Only once recently have I been in a great group where we managed<br/>
to keep alpha looting, and even then it was a struggle.  A couple of the<br/>
tanks complained mightily, until I pointed out that it was my heals keeping<br/>
them alive, and if they weren&#39;t going to let me loot every so often then I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t heal them.  Didn&#39;t have to carry the threat through, thank the<br/>
gods. Not sure if I would have done :-)<br/>
Not that I&#39;m loot greedy at all, but my characters aren&#39;t twinked and last<br/>
time I bought my new spells I couldn&#39;t afford them all.  Am trying to<br/>
survive with fairly crap armour and weapons.  I&#39;m lvl 23 and have about<br/>
100pp to my name, with more spells to buy next level.<br/>
The best group I found was partnering a monk who didn&#39;t want any of the loot<br/>
at all!<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] About loot order<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems with<br/>
&gt; loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br/>
&gt; healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br/>
&gt; totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>
&gt; loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they<br/>
care<br/>
&gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>
&gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>
&gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>
&gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>
&gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>
&gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>
&gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>
&gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>
expensive<br/>
&gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>
&gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>
&gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
&gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
&gt; Just wondering.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>
&gt; people cooperate.<br/>
