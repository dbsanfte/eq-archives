<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Shaman Soloing... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-6702134">I have an idea, and you may like it.<br><br>There is a little known zone, well its known but no body wants to go there cause its abit out there. With the GOD expansion came a zone called &quot;Forgotten Halls&quot;. It is adjacent to Jaggedpine Forrest.<br><br>Its an instanced zone, so you can solo there or go in with 5 friends. Go to the LDON camps and speak to the maguses there. Tell them &quot;Nedaria&#39;s Landing&quot; and you will be ported there. ONce in Nedaria&#39;s, go to the docks and find a High Elven Male on the docks, I forget his name, i think it starts with an &quot;E&quot;. Anyway, he is wearing some kind of ornate tunic.<br><br>Do the dialog words and you will be given access, much like an LDON. If you look at your compass, there will be a line marking your direction. Follow the line and you will enter a cave, where you will see some short chick, again her name escapes me. Do the dialog with her, and yo then have access. Click on the rock beside her and your in.<br><br>The nice thing about
 this zone, is at lower levels, nothing aggros you. In here you&nbsp; kill bats, rats, or &quot;earthen rejects&quot;.. There is a bat room, a rat room, and room with a mix of bats, rats, and earthen rejects. The rejects have a little more hp and hit a little harder, but should be ok. WARNING... only attack bats, rats,or the earthen rejects. Attack anything else and the whole zone will unleash hell ipon your head.<br><br>The zone respawns quite fast, so if you go in with a couple people you will never run out of mobs to kill. It does get boring, but if you want quiet effortless killing, go here. I took my SK here and in about 3 hours, i managed to get her 2hs up from 20 to 100. Without a healer, it is tough, but was doable.<br><br>The xp is quite good. If its just you, then the xp is close to what you would pick up in PC. With others, percentage wise it drops, but again, with the abundance of mobs, that shouldnt matter.<br><br>I took both of my clerics there and now their offensive
 and defensive skills are maxed. Without the worry of aggro, its an awesome place. I havent tried it, but with everything non-aggro there, one could most likely fear kite in there. I.m not sure about quadding tho, dont have the cahoneys to try that.<br><br>At around level 53 or so, stuff will start to aggro you, so unless you have good crowd control, this zone is no longer good solo. <br><br>BTW, there is one way in and 2 ways out. 1) gate, or 2) speak to the dude at zone in, tell him you wish to leave...and he will put his foot to ur arse and zone you out.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br><br><br><b><i>rickcorriveau &lt;rickcorriveau@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-6702134replbq" style="border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;">    I have a lvl 25 shaman and I am trying to solo but wondering if I <br> just have it wrong.&nbsp; I spend more time medding than anything else.&nbsp; <br> What are some decent zones to attemp to solo at
