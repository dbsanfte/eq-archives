<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555062971">It has nothing to do with a low res version of Vah Shir model.  In fact that<br/>
is in the game now.  With the SoL expansion you can set it on a low res<br/>
version of the entire game or high if you choose to ( that includes both<br/>
game world and player models ).  The whole problem here is when Microsoft<br/>
made a majority of video cards obsolete with the release of directx 8..<br/>
PERIOD...  Everquest is over 3 years old now.  When it was first released<br/>
Directx was in release 6.  Since then with the introduction of Kunark and<br/>
Velious, players were required to upgrade to release 7.  Directx 7 made<br/>
minor improvements to 6, however, didn&#39;t require changes to the home users<br/>
PC.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have Luclin you can immediately see the improvements in graphics.. It<br/>
looks absolutely great.  Problem is for a game that&#39;s been out so long they<br/>
need to keep up with the release schedule of Microsoft&#39;s DirectX.  With the<br/>
introduction of WindowsXP they ( they being Microsoft ) introduced a new<br/>
release version 8.  Everquest is a game that has gone through 3 different<br/>
versions of directx in order to keep up with the visual quality that ever<br/>
other game out there has had the luxury of not having to contend with.  I<br/>
guarantee that if any other game out there attempted to provide the<br/>
enhancements and a quality product that incorporated the latest video<br/>
standards they would be experiencing the same problem.  Do you see any other<br/>
company even attempting to release a updated DirectX 8 version?  Return to<br/>
Castle Wolfenstein was released and is a DirectX 8 only product that<br/>
incorporates the same technology improvements.  You will, however, never see<br/>
a DirectX 9 version... Nor will they be supporting the same program 3 years<br/>
from now.<br/>
<br/>
Hehe.. Computer technology changes every few months.. If your still using<br/>
the same computer you had 3 years ago, its probably time to upgrade.  Ah<br/>
well.. Its Christmas :)<br/>
