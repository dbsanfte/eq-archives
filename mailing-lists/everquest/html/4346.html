<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678490631"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Thanks. I found it. Unfortunately, I mistakenly thought that one of <br/>

for shaman spells<br/>
<br/>
casters realm is pretty good for an overview of the availible spells,<br/>
even if they have some minor errors in their lists ... but for a start<br/>
it is pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ok. I have a minor healing spell and a spell that raises hit points. <br/>
&gt; [...]<br/>
&gt; need to? Is there still hope for my character?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i just created a shammy cat. my starting equipment is:<br/>
    - 20 Bread Cakes<br/>
    - 20 Skin of Milk<br/>
    - Club<br/>
    - Scroll of Minor Healing<br/>
    - Scroll: Inner Fire<br/>
    - A Dar Khura Guild Summons<br/>
<br/>
no problem to equip Club. none of the things can be sold to vendors,<br/>
because either they are NO DROP or marked as &quot;newbie gear&quot;<br/>
indicated by the &quot;*&quot; after the item name.<br/>
<br/>
with the club in my hands i started to work on the first quests. after<br/>
a bit over an hour i was working on the 2nd shammy quest, was<br/>
level 3 and hand almost 4gp ... <br/>
<br/>
so basically you have to try to get your weapon in the hand and<br/>
start killing critters ... :-)<br/>
<br/>
besides, don&#39;t forget to &quot;con&quot; things ... hit &quot;c&quot; to see what their<br/>
color is. &quot;white&quot; ones are the harder ones ... &quot;blue&quot; ones should<br/>
be your main &quot;food&quot; ... better don&#39;t go for yellow or red stuff.<br/>
<br/>
and just keep bashing on things ... look for quests where you<br/>
get &quot;containers&quot; to collect things: it is cheaper than buying backpacks.<br/>
