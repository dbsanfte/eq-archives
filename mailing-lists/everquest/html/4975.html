<div id="ygrps-yiv-719516912">I have heard camp checks still.  But I&#39;ve been in Dulak a lot lately <br/>
and each ship is a camp.  Passing through the old camp areas I have <br/>
heard camp checks, but not as often as in the old days.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to remember is that there are no exclusive rights to a <br/>
camp.  The EQ play nice rules say that any spot in dispute must be <br/>
shared.  Sure, usually a GM has to enforce it and who&#39;s seen a GM <br/>
lately?<br/>
<br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t worry about reprisals from campers.  What can they <br/>
do?  Actions speak louder than words.  You wouldn&#39;t want to group <br/>
with people that don&#39;t pay attention to their area.  That can get you <br/>
killed in plenty of zones.  And there&#39;s always /report and /ignore if <br/>
they bother you.<br/>
