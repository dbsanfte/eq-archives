&gt; 4.  Rubi, Rubi, Rubi,  personally I hate rubi.. hehe...  I think its<br/>
&gt; wonderful that they have added additional sets of armor, plus the fact its<br/>
&gt; class specific.  It would be a truly boring place if everyone was decked out<br/>
&gt; in all red.  I have to say the newly created no drop item quest for class<br/>
&gt; specific armor, was a godsend.  Lets look at the pluses:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; a.  Armor tailored for a class with stats helping to further balance the<br/>
&gt; classes overall.<br/>

&gt; b.  Items for quest are no drop, therefore if you want the armor you pretty<br/>
&gt; much have to loot the items yourself. This minimizes the camping by casters<br/>
&gt; who are in it just for the money.  I hate having to lower myself to<br/>
&gt; trade/buy an item from some caster, that could never use it to being with,<br/>
&gt; whom probably KS&#39;d it from someone who really needed it.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t play a paladin (cos they have to be a master smith in addition<br/>
to do a very long and involved quest).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; c.  Quest items are also spread out across the entire world forcing players<br/>
&gt; to move about the zones.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Previously when I hunted in OOT I had what I wanted, now I have to<br/>
compete. So I am not a big fan of that.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; d.  Each armor piece requires the actual spending of money, ill be it to the<br/>
&gt; merchants :(, and this is good to increase the overall value of the<br/>
&gt; platinum.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sell Rubi in a shop, say the SolA Merchant, make it mega expensive. Too<br/>
easy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; e.  The quest are, from what I have experienced, quite sufficiently<br/>
&gt; difficult.  When teamed with a nice group they can be completed, however if<br/>
&gt; you want to solo you better be ready to dish it out.. hehe<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ummmm. Cleric quests are completely pointless .. Sit in a burnt out<br/>
house in Kithicor for 8 hours, then go to a tree stump and sit there for<br/>
8 hours (BTW nothing to kill in kithicor to pass the time). Do some<br/>
running. Pay 250pp and get a pair of boots only slight better then<br/>
bronze or steelplate and worse then Rubi.<br/>
<br/>
SK&#39;s and Pala&#39;s is much much worse.<br/>
<br/>
Why is the chain wearing classes quest armour higher AC and stats then<br/>
some of plate wearing classes ?<br/>
<br/>
Warrior : AC and stats better then rubi.<br/>
Ranger, Shaman, Rogue, bard : AC as good and stats better then rubi.<br/>
Clerics, palas and sk&#39;s : AC worse (and for cleric stats pretty useless<br/>
except for bracers).</div>
