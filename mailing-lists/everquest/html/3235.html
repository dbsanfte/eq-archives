&gt; back. I actually did forgat a few things and want to refamiliarize<br/>
&gt; myself, On the 3 bars that tell you your health and level status, I<br/>
&gt; forgot what the blue line is for. I know it has something to do with<br/>
&gt; your charma or something like that. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s your mana bar.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Also I just started playing with a Necro just to see what it&#39;s like. Any<br/>
&gt; good suggestion for getting Necro stuff? BTW I&#39;m a Gnome. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I&#39;ve never played a necro.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; What are the elements a Magician needs to conjure up a elementa pet like<br/>
&gt; fire or earth? I ran out and now I can&#39;t remember what I need to get!<br/>
