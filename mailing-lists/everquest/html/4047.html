<p>BTW, as for TechTV in general, man I wish that I had that channel. ANy chance of it going&nbsp;into basic cable?&nbsp;

We<br>are not doing a hit piece on EQ at all. We are just interested in having someone<br>come on who can explain what the game is all about, describe how one gets<br>involved and talk about the so-called addictive nature of it. I think I found<br>someone who will do all of those things. We have no intention of grilling<br>anybody about suicides. Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. I am happy you<br>like our network and we&#39;ll keep trying to get better. There&#39;s actually a lot of<br>really cool show ideas in the pipeline right now. I think you&#39;ll be happy.<br><br>Adam Dreyfus<br>Booking Manager<br>TechTV<br>415-355-4158<br>adamdreyfus@...<br><br>------------ Previous Message from&nbsp; Ashley Dusenbery &lt;ashley@...&gt;<br>on&nbsp; 11/14/2002 01:09:29 PM ----------<br><br><br>Please respond to EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br><br>To:&nbsp;&nbsp; EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br>cc:<br>Subject:&nbsp; Re: [EverQuest] Hi...I am looking for a EQ entusiast (addict) for a TV<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interview<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com/">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!

I am sure that<br>whatever package they are producing will be fair and informative to both players<br>and non-players of Everquest. Call for help is, as you might guess from the<br>title, is a call-in show where the host help people out with their computer<br>questions. I hardly think they will be grilling interview-ees about EQ suicides<br>or any other hot button issues. They may mention the addictive nature of EQ, but<br>I doubt it will turn into any sort of an inquisition. TechTv has always been<br>cool about covering computer games and the culture of computer gamers.
