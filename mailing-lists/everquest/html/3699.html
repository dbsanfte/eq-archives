<div id="ygrps-yiv-110068799">100% weight reduction bags? how many slots?<br/>
Is it regular tailoring, hafling, or velious? What is it trivial at?<br/>
Man, I wish I was on your server, I would give you the tufts I found laying<br/>
around in the thurg bank.<br/>
I never knew what they were used for.. What do you need to make them?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; To the best of my knowledge, the tufts are an EW drop only. The only<br/>
&gt; known use I have seen is for the 100% weight reduction bags. I only<br/>
&gt; have two so far. Need three to make my first attempt at the<br/>
&gt; combination. That is just the beginning for making the bags.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I got tired of camping Brutes in Warsliks Woods, so finally made<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; journey to Velious. I took the boat, just to have done it once.<br/>
&gt; Found<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my way to Eastern Wastes. Started foraging the tufts of dire wolf<br/>
&gt; fur<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I need for advancing my tailoring.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have not been fortunate in hunting. Level 34 puts me low on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; food chain in EW. I have tried my standard hunting routine from<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; foot of the bridge, but have been beaten back to the zone<br/>
&gt; repeatedly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This last time, I crossed the zone to get away from a mob, and was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; instantly killed by some kind of tracking wolf pack. They took me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; down twice more in the next fifteen minutes. Found someone else<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; contending with them when I resurrected. He being a higher level<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; offered to train them away, and did so. I got my corpse and got my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff back, but am now a high 33 again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I may have to rethink my Velious career. Solo at 34 in EW seems a<br/>
&gt; bit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tough, even if I need the tufts.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Are the direwolf tufts only for hafling tailoring?<br/>
&gt; &gt; I keep seeing them dropped on the ground near the bank. If they can<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; foraged I think you can forage them in GD and Thurgadin. GD seems<br/>
&gt; to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; less mobs. There are some spots that are safer to hunt. There&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; spot where<br/>
&gt; &gt; you can just get the wolves and if you get into trouble you can run<br/>
&gt; to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; coldain wolves and guards for help.<br/>
