New to the group so I thought I would drop in and say hello. I played <br/>
EQ some time ago, six or seven years and it&#39;s changed quite a bit to <br/>
say the least. I do like the Tutorial, which allowed me to create a <br/>
character and get him to 10-11th level in no time at all. Now being <br/>
12th level, I play a Troll SK, what&#39;s a good place to hunt. I group <br/>
when I can but the servers not always busy. Looking for good xp and <br/>
coin of course. Figured Befallen or the Lava fields.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all<br/>
<br/>
