 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve experienced this as well.. However I believe it more likely comes from<br/>
the fact that some defensive skills don&#39;t work when something&#39;s attacking<br/>
you from behind.  Most mobs are based off the warrior class so inherent the<br/>
same defense skills i.e. Riposte, etc. Truth be told as a ranger I prefer to<br/>
avoid the brunt of the attack and position myself behind the target while<br/>
grouped.  I can take advantage of the slight bonus and take in the less<br/>
damage. =)<br/>
