 </span></blockquote>Thanks. I worked it out finally. G. The email Sony sent me on the <br/>
weekend had a link to reset my password but it didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
I tied the support page again to get another password reset email <br/>
today and it worked.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was that the new update required an 8 character password <br/>
and my original password was created when only 6 characters were <br/>
required. ;) I&#39;m not the only one having that problem. I tried to <br/>
call sony and the lines busy. G. Wouldn&#39;t it have been nice if the <br/>
last upgrade simply asked you if your old password was less thn 8 <br/>
characters long when the password failed? Then all of those angry <br/>
gamers who will be calling Sony about that problem for the next week <br/>
could have been told what to do next when they answered yes.<br/>
<br/>
Hind sight is 20-20? The programmers don&#39;t have to answer the phones. <br/>
G. Hehehe.<br/>
