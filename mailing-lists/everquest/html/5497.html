And how many screen shots did you take :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On time my video card blew. I had to use the on-board video<br/>
&gt; from my main<br/>
&gt; board. Needless to say, the graphics capability lacked a lot.<br/>
&gt; My character<br/>
&gt; is a Val Shir. The main board video chip wasn&#39;t capable of<br/>
&gt; handling the<br/>
&gt; polygons for clothing. All of the female kitty dancers at the<br/>
&gt; campfire in<br/>
&gt; Thicket were completely nude. I sat down in from to the white<br/>
&gt; tigress for<br/>
&gt; about 10 minutes and watched her dance. The dances were short<br/>
&gt; but very<br/>
&gt; entertaining.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Having played EQ, Asheron&#39;s Call and Dark Age of Camelot I will say that EQ<br/>
has the highest learning curve of them all, at least for me.  Part of it is<br/>
the ever-changing aspect of the game.  I have a play-guide from 1998 and<br/>
some of the stuff in it is flat out wrong now.  I keep finding info on<br/>
websites that does not work.  I do not recall having those problems with AC,<br/>
and DAOC is to new to be that changed.</div>
