<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664228675">Its a lost cause..  You argoed a mob, there are a number of mobs in the<br/>
seafarer&#39;s roost.  Some of which are there only during certain game hours.<br/>
Ya just have to be more careful about where you go.  If you scroll back I&#39;m<br/>
sure it told you by whom you were attacked.  GM&#39;s will not reimburse you for<br/>
the problem which you described, to the least they are not allowed to.<br/>
Sorry about that. =(<br/>
