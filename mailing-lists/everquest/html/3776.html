<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318736121">I have been hunting Snow Cougars in Iceclad for a level and a half. <br/>
The experience is good, and whether solo or duo the time invested is <br/>
about the same. Not bad, but I am not making any money.<br/>
<br/>
Previously I farmed Brutes in Warsliks Woods. Nominal experience, but <br/>
made lots of cash.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas where I can go as a lvl 35 Druid to get a good balance of <br/>
cash/loot and experience? Mostly I solo, as I am usually in for an <br/>
hour at a time. Get in a few hours together now and then, but for <br/>
short sessions getting a group consumes most of the time available.<br/>
