<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-262246391">I fairly effectively managed to play both a druid and bard duo at the same<br/>
time. It was pretty hard bc I had to keep running between computers. but the<br/>
druid nuked and healed, the bard meled and played mana song.<br/>

&gt; &gt; true, very true...  but nothing rocks like a monk/shammy combo<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; what i also like very much is a druid/monk or druid/warrior combo,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; because of the druids transportation spells ... but with luclin<br/>
&gt; it already got much better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IMHO druids/shammies work better with monks, because monks don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; need the extreme heals like warriors. a warrior/cleric combo is<br/>
&gt; pretty &quot;brutal&quot;, but the cleric has no SoW-like spells and not<br/>
&gt; everyone has jboots ... well, you could still buy SoW potions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; another interesting combo is mage/cleric (which i currently use).<br/>
&gt; but i know it only works very good at 39+ for the cleric and 51+<br/>
&gt; for the mage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i also played a chantress/wizzy combo for some time ... it makes<br/>
&gt; both parts very happy ... and very effective ... ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i wanted to try a bard/ranger combo one day, but i think this has<br/>
&gt; to be done by two persons, because both classes are very active<br/>
&gt; ones.<br/>
