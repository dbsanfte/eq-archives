&gt;Oh, you want MORE camping for items that break huh? Well maybe you should <br/>
&gt;exclude MAGIC items from the durability feature.. I am not gonna spend <br/>
&gt;ANOTHER month and 200 hours in guk to get ghoulbane again just because I <br/>
&gt;forgot to go to a smith to repair it.. Personally I can spend weeks out in <br/>
&gt;nowhere not going to a city at all, I don&#39;t want to have to travel back to <br/>
&gt;a city all the time to repair items.. It&#39;s hard enough to get them, don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;want to have to repair them aswell.. This is a damn stupid idea if you ask <br/>
&gt;me, good for player trade skill economy perhaps but it still is crap.. Oh <br/>
&gt;and with the latest patch, Verant apparently want all the paladins to be <br/>
&gt;blacksmiths, so smithing will be pretty crowded as a trade skill..<br/>

I didn&#39;t say my suggestions are/were fullproof. If I sat and thought about <br/>
it long enough, I&#39;m sure I could come up with a better method than my <br/>
original suggestions. But it doesn&#39;t matter what I come up with, Verant just <br/>
isn&#39;t going to listen. That&#39;s the whole damn problem. Verant isn&#39;t listening <br/>
to anyone who doesn&#39;t represent a large amount of $$$ to them.</div>
