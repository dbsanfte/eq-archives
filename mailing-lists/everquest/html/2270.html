<div id="ygrps-yiv-501227120"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;to me. Sure, I sometimes get stiffed and sometimes<br/>
&gt;get something I can&#39;t use as a tip, but for the most<br/>
&gt;part I think I have been well rewarded. For me <br/>
&gt;it is in character and adds to the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think i&#39;m coming to the conclusion that a Druid<br/>
should less demand payment for a TP, than players<br/>
should feel that the right thing to do is to donate<br/>
what they can for one. :) As someone who&#39;s taken quite<br/>
a few, I always make sure I have the standard 10pp<br/>
available to offer, it&#39;s just the right thing to do<br/>
for the investment of time being given for the other<br/>
player. I don&#39;t think i&#39;d stand there once my druid<br/>
can group TP and demand payment, but watching that<br/>
twinked level 12 with better equipment than I have go<br/>
on about how broke he is might be a little hard to<br/>
swallow.<br/>
