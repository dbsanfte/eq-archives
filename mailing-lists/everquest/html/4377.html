<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883843857">Exactly! I think they should be like portable banks. Except they wouldn&#39;t do<br/>
coin conversion.<br/>
I also kinda wish the horses and stuff could be like the ones in D&D where<br/>
there are different kinds. Ones to carry stuff, ones for riding, or ones for<br/>
fighting. And riding could be a skill.<br/>
I really wish they&#39;d lower horse prices... I don&#39;t want one for prestige. I<br/>
want one that is useful. For the prices horses cost they should give you<br/>
+100 to your charisma.<br/>
