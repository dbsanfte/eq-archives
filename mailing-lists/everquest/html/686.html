<div id="ygrps-yiv-32823258">Verant has purposefully &#39;hidden&#39; this information from the users - as they<br/>
do with the exact mana<br/>
and stamina statistics.  I&#39;ve heard that they think it makes it more<br/>
&quot;realistic&quot; and are trying to discourage<br/>
people from being overly concerned with statistics.<br/>
<br/>
This is easily criticized - as you see the figure as it increases; but<br/>
that&#39;s how they want it.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Skills & Stats question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:alliani@...">alliani@...</a> (Randy & Lori Alliani)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if there is some place to actually *see* your specific<br/>
&gt; stats in a given skill.  For instance, I see my 1H Blunt going up<br/>
&gt; point by point on the text box, but can&#39;t see any place that shows<br/>
&gt; what point I&#39;m at *now* in all my skills.  I have a friend who says<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s seen a screen that lists them but can&#39;t remember how to get to<br/>
&gt; it now.  :o/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I was recently killed by Tovax Vmar.  I was confused at first<br/>
&gt; but was informed he kills random newbies... Okay, I can live with that<br/>
&gt; (even if my character didn&#39;t &lt;grin&gt;) but before he killed me he &quot;said&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Cannot open file Q2TovaxPL.txt&quot;.  What is that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
