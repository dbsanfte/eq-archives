guildleader for a pretty large (semi high end, were in the elemental planes) , I 
have to say that the damage/delay on weapons for a warrior has nothing to do 
with him holding aggro. The warrior class is very dependant on weapons that have 
an aggro producing proc attached on them. These weapons have an ok damage/delay 
but this has very little to do with the warrior actually holding aggro. In my 
opinion this makes the warrior class somewhat broken, but thats another story 
and wasnt part of the discussion.</font></span></div>

are several weapons that have this some better some worse. Like the warrior 
epic, blade of carnage, Blade of war for example. Blade of war has the big 
advantage of beeing a 2hander to not having to take high ripostes. This is 
absolutely neccessary in some fights to keep the MT alive.</font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Put 2 
warriors beside each other on a mob have them taunt away, one using a &quot;turbo&quot; 
damage/delay weapon without a proc and the other with blade of war and I can 
guarantee who will hold aggro. Every time, all the time. </font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">As for 
giving an example on why you dont want to take ripostes, imagine fighting 
anything that hits 2000 or higher, and then imagine two ripostes instead of one. 
Thats a pretty big difference. Or imagine fighting a 3600 quadding mob, it can 
oneround you without defensive disc, try putting a SK or PAlly on this and the 
fight is over before it started. Im not saying that this is your average fight, 
but the do happen quite a bit. The &quot;tankability&quot; of a warrior &gt;&gt; any other 
class. The main problem is holding the aggro.</font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">On 
normal exp mobs a Pally or SK works fine as tank, or on special mobs with aggro 
wipes (some mobs memblur themselves for example) or mobs that proc detaunt on 
MT. In these situations it can be troublesome to usea Warrior as MT cause the 
aggro a warrior produces takes a little time, and if its wiped every other round 
it wont be firm aggro, taunting factor on sk or pally is high and is easier to 
control. But these kind of mobs typically arent very hard hitters to make them 
tankable for these non defensive disc classes. </font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1833428505218275206-28042003"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">But 
this is all a highend description and is more intersting if you are 65 and has a 
bunch of aa and raid every day. Its not the average exp group players everyday 
fights.</font></span></div>

  <p>Must have missed a few mails hehe, anyway it looks like a typical &quot;my class 
  is better argument&quot;.</p> 
  <p>What he means by DPS is Damage Per Second which is how Melees work out most 
  efficient weapon combo&#39;s. As for a tank (Pure Warrior) not needing DPS that is 
  not really true, Tanks have to keep aggro and best way to do this is by 
  hurting the target the most, if the Tank isn&#39;t doing enough DPS then all the 
  Taunting in the world won&#39;t stop the target hitting the 
  Rangers/Rogues/Bards/Casters. As for the pally/SK being MT they don&#39;t have to 
  many HP, but they can hold their own with decent gear

  high-end stuff here? =P rofl, one of the replys had a 
  <div></div>&gt;decent advice and the rest was exactly what you said you didn&#39;t 
  want. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Another thing, dps means shit to a tank, a tank is about 
  building aggro and 
  <div></div>&gt;beeing the main focus of your mobs. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Pally is useless as a MT, SK is way better but why not a 
  warrior if you&#39;re 
  <div></div>&gt;looking for a MT? However, like the previous mail said, ogre SK 
  would 
  <div></div>&gt;probably be your best choice.
