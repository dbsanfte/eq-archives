 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you have a Velium weapon.  Those are pretty common <br/>
anymore.  They come in almost all weapon types and are easy to find.  <br/>
They usually go for around 10 plat.  Most people use them because <br/>
they are magic and they can hunt magic only mobs.  Their ratios are <br/>
good until about 20, then you should be able to get better.<br/>
