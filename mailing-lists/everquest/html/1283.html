<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106249193"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I&#39;ve never been in a group that has done that. &nbsp;Seems to me that that would 
<br>be kinda hard to keep track of. &nbsp;

<br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote TYPE="CITE" style="BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;">Yup, I kick those people out. &nbsp;The groups I am in now we don&#39;t FFA, Alpha or
<br>roll for anything that&#39;s not a special drop. &nbsp;I would say 99% of the time
<br>the group picks someone we can trust and someone with more than two bags of
<br>free space to hold loot and that person loots everything and when its time
<br>for someone to leave he splits the pp and the items that he has looted.
<br>This system works very well for most the groups I have been in.
