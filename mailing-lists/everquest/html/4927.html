&gt; I&#39;m still relatively new to EQ, but so far I love it.  I agree about<br/>
&gt; corpse runs, they bite.  I think the idea about the NPC and buying<br/>
&gt; back your corpse has potential but needs refinement.  As far as<br/>
&gt; tradeskills go, I have been working up my first tradeskill<br/>
&gt; (Fletching as I am a ranger).  I am actually have pretty good<br/>
&gt; success with it.  I&#39;ve gotten it to 120 (making THOUSANDS of arrows)<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m to the point now where I can make pretty good arrows.  I<br/>
&gt; partner with a fellow guildmate (cleric) to sell them in the bazaar,<br/>
&gt; because I&#39;m using a dial-up connection :( and can&#39;t really set up a<br/>
&gt; trader to run as much as he does.  We sell the arrows for 1pp a<br/>
&gt; piece and split the money 50/50.  I pay for all the supplies, but I<br/>
&gt; would anyway to level my fletching.  We&#39;re doing okay.  Recently we<br/>
&gt; sold 450 arrows made 450 pp, my cut was 225 pp, and it cost me<br/>
&gt; approx 125 pp to buy supplies.  It&#39;s not a huge money maker, but it<br/>
&gt; allows me to buy the next flight up of materials for increasing my<br/>
&gt; skill.  Bows are the other aren&#39;t going as well.  It hurts to pay<br/>
&gt; 25pp for materials and then fail :(.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh cool! Good luck on the fletching. I haven&#39;t tried that one yet as I&#39;ve<br/>
never used range weapons with any of my characters. High level tailoring<br/>
bites in terms of price. I used up all of my acrylia bits and all of my<br/>
superb rockhopper hides and didn&#39;t even have one increase in skill. And I<br/>
failed a few times. it sucked bigtime. Now I have to go get more hides and<br/>
acrylia. Not easy for my character to solo either. If I could snare I could<br/>
probably do ok, but alas, clerics can&#39;t snare. At least I can outrun things<br/>
with runspeed 3 though.<br/>
