The easiest place to buy coffins is on the moon, in the bazaar zone. The<br/>
first merchant next to the bank sells them. He sells both kinds, stackable<br/>
and non-stackable coffins. I just had to buy a couple yesterday :-( Some<br/>
guild members do not listen about pushing mobs through the wall, I was<br/>
tanking a flurry drake in NToV and it got pushed through the wall and it<br/>
summon myself and 2 others. Since I was bound in bazaar and the corpse&#39;s<br/>
were now almost to the Plane of Mischief zone, they had to be summoned. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, has anyone else been to the PoM zone before? Some card drops are<br/>
dropped at a ridiculous rate. <br/>

	I have to Agree with Erik here.  Each class hass a role to play in <br/>
	any grouping.  Especially when it comes epic Raids.  As one of the <br/>
	premier Sk&#39;s in my guild on Saryn,  I&#39;m needed  in regards to <br/>
	tanking, Fearing on occassion and if we need to go to aplace with <br/>
	alot of undead like the Epic raid to The Hole this past weekend IVU <br/>
	was needed to get to where 2 of the Epic mobs spawned so we didnt <br/>
	have a bunch of casualties. alos using hat Evocation skill is a <br/>
	definate plus when using the Ward Undead line of spells.  Also to a <br/>
	minor degree so far  with FD we can stay at the pull spot and be the<br/>
<br/>
	spy network to give out the all clear if everyone in the group is <br/>
	dead  so the Clerics if they have not zoned or logged can come in<br/>
and <br/>
	rezz folks<br/>
<br/>
	Monks are great for pulling when it comes to breaking agro&#39;s.  Using<br/>
<br/>
	FD  9 times out of 10 they can sucessfully  break the agro train so <br/>
	the rest of us can go after one particular mob. <br/>
<br/>
	Clerics obviously are a plus when it comes to heals and rezzes if <br/>
	things go completely awry<br/>
<br/>
	Rangers and Druids have that nice tracking ability to let folks know<br/>
<br/>
	if the objective has spawned or not.  Not to mention the dot&#39;s, <br/>
	snares and roots they have<br/>
<br/>
	Necros  have this nice little spell called summoned corpse. if<br/>
things <br/>
	get hairy and peeps who were not able to get out in time need to get<br/>
<br/>
	a rezz and their corpse happens to be deep into the zone with a <br/>
	gazillion mobs between the zoneline and their corpse (CT, ToFS, The <br/>
	Hole, Befallen are prime examples) If the prson  manages to make it <br/>
	back tot he zone nekked then the necro can target the PC and summon <br/>
	the corpse.  admittedly Sk have the lesser summon corpse spell but <br/>
	ihave not used it yet and still can&#39;t find whre Ineed to get the <br/>
	coffin Ineed for that spell seeing as Neriak still doenst have them <br/>
	hehe I may ned to go into Paineel for it.  Plus necros can fear cast<br/>
<br/>
	IVU and also have other nice damaging spells at teir disposal.  and <br/>
	DMF is to die for when you need to swim to someplace and you dont <br/>
	have  a good  underwater spell not to mentionletting you see invis <br/>
	and float at the same time<br/>
<br/>
	Shamans have a lot of nice spells to cast on peeps and some can be <br/>
	stacked with other peeps buffs.  not to mention they have some nice <br/>
	dot&#39;s  and back up roots  if the Druids are unable to root.<br/>
<br/>
	Pallies make great tanks as well as back up healers and at higher <br/>
	levels can do  limited rezes. buffs are of the lower end Cleric line<br/>
<br/>
	but if no cleric is around for heal&#39;s buffs and rezzes, are you<br/>
gonna <br/>
	complain? I ain&#39;t cause a pally buff/heal could mean the difference <br/>
	between life and death.<br/>
<br/>
	Chanter&#39;s have ths nice mezz line of spells as well as charm.  Ever <br/>
	been to a raid or in group where you have a couple of mobs on your <br/>
	rear end and you happen to see a mob fighitng another mob?  Thank <br/>
	that Chanter for that.  And their  Clarity line of spells are a <br/>
	godsend for  all of us mana users<br/>
<br/>
	Speaking of Meddings and such dont forgett eh bards with their mana <br/>
	song that goes quite well in conjuntion with Clarity.  also their <br/>
	Regen song goes great in conjunction with  some of teh Regen spells <br/>
	some peeps (shammy  comes to mind right off the bat) have<br/>
<br/>
	Then you have the Rogues.  Not only do they tank well but they also <br/>
	have this nice  backstab ability that can do some serious damage to <br/>
	the mob giving that nice death from behind effect<br/>
<br/>
	Mages and Wizards have some great nuke spells that come quite handy <br/>
	when an especially difficult mob is encountered and the pally lay on<br/>
<br/>
	hands is used up the sk harm touch is used up and your healers are <br/>
	oom <br/>
<br/>
	And last but not least oyu have the Warrior.  The premier Tank <br/>
	class.  You need a tanks to help take down a mob call a warrior.<br/>
not <br/>
	only do they hit hard but the can do some nice crits as well as kick<br/>
<br/>
	harder than a mule and igf I remember correctly they can duel wield <br/>
	and double attack thus making them a force to be reckoned with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	My apologies if I did not mention the Beastlord.  I have not come <br/>
	across one yet at the time of this writing so i have very little <br/>
	(read as none =()information as to how they fit in the scheme of <br/>
	things.<br/>
<br/>
	All of the above of course is based on my personal encounters with <br/>
	each of these classes.  Whether my encounter be in group or based on<br/>
<br/>
	the chars I have of a particular class.<br/>

	&gt; This is the kinda thing that gives people the wrong impression<br/>
about<br/>
	&gt; classes.  Shaman are extremely important to a raid, from slowing a<br/>
<br/>
	mob to<br/>
	&gt; giving melee some excellent stat buffs.  High level Rangers put<br/>
out <br/>
	obscene<br/>
	&gt; amounts of damage and are able to tank mobs that aggro on casters,<br/>
<br/>
	while<br/>
	&gt; being about to almost immedialely reduce aggro when needed.  Mages<br/>
<br/>
	are<br/>
	&gt; excellent for mana regen (mod rods) and CotH.  Druids are<br/>
excellent<br/>
	&gt; secondary healers on raid, throwing in heals between CHs.  Monks <br/>
	and SK&#39;s<br/>
	&gt; are excellent indoor pullers (breaking Fear is terribly hard <br/>
	without a Monk<br/>
	&gt; or SK to scout).<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; There really isn&#39;t one single class that is not needed in a raid <br/>
	situation.<br/>
