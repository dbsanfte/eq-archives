<div id="ygrps-yiv-718091943">Level 20. Just type in /surname &lt;and the one you want&gt; and if it&#39;s not taken<br/>
you&#39;ll get it. However I just got my first one and I&#39;m discovering that it<br/>
will not accept phrases. For example, I wanted to use &quot;Thehiddenone&quot; for my<br/>
main but it would not take it. <br/>
<br/>
I have one picked out for my next one and I hope it will take it. <br/>
<br/>
My mage is ready for his but I&#39;m not sure what to pick. His name is Shizney.<br/>
What sounds cool with Shizney? LOL<br/>
