<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] New VahShir models <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-47361561">hmmmm I thought I was seeing something last night but<br/>
now that you mention this, it seems while using the<br/>
new ui, that the female Vah Shir is very skinny.<br/>
Similar to the Iksar but more agile looking,<br/>
I am not sure if this is the change or notm but<br/>
nonetheless, the char did not look like anything I<br/>
have seen yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will check tonight.....hmmm maybe create on from<br/>
scratch to see.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Glad I am not crazy........................YET<br/>
