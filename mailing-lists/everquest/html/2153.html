<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104156515">I hope it&#39;s not serious. That is so retarded. I mean, I *think* it&#39;s<br/>
possible for people to actually get accounts by paying with check or<br/>
something else.<br/>
This is just stupid.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am in need of help.  I used to play everquest all the time using a<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends username and password until he changed his password and never<br/>
&gt; &gt; told me what the new one was.  I know i am about to ask a stupid<br/>
&gt; &gt; question but is there any way that anyone would let me use their<br/>
&gt; &gt; username and password.  I would be very greatful and i would stay off<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the severs you use, and i would help you anyway that i could.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would get a username and password if i could but i dont have a credit<br/>
&gt; &gt; card.  I&#39;m sorry if i have bothered any of you fine gamers but i just<br/>
&gt; &gt; had to ask.  and if you will let me use your username and password<br/>
&gt; &gt; email me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank you for taking the time to read this.<br/>
