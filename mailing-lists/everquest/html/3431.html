<div id="ygrps-yiv-390866690">I&#39;m blanking on OS. What is OS?<br/>
KC might be a good idea. Thanks!<br/>
Speaking of jaggedpine I had someone beg me to come to Qeynos Hills with<br/>
them to rez a bunch of people who were killed in some sort of GM event. all<br/>
kinds of npcs were in front of surefall glade. I hung out and rezzed people<br/>
then after waiting and finding they might not be able to make it happen<br/>
again for another hour or more I decided to head out and get some sleep.<br/>
Was anyone around for an event of that type in Qhills?<br/>
luv,<br/>

Only 2 places like that are Vox&#39;s lair (only inside it where she is, NOT<br/>
the rest of the zone) and Naggy&#39;s lair (same thing). Any OTHER part of the<br/>
zone is 100% normal for all levels, and can be gone into. As for exp...try<br/>
Karnor&#39;s and  OS. Jaggedpine might be a good bet too.<br/>

  Subject: [EverQuest] Hunting grounds for 50+<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place to hunt<br/>
to<br/>
  get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>
  Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the other<br/>
  parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is there..<br/>
  does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I<br/>
will<br/>
  hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to<br/>
zone<br/>
  beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the<br/>
higher<br/>
  lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>
  Any suggestions?<br/>
  luv,<br/>
  -Su<br/>
