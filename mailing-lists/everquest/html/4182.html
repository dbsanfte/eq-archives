<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013104479">I run ME on a wimp Emachine. I had some problems until I learned to <br/>
clear out the rediculous number of background aps that the factory <br/>
software load stuffs into these package systems. After that, the os <br/>
was not the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I get adequate operation on all older EQ software. Up through <br/>
Velious. Very choppy on Luclin and POP. Planning to do an upgrade <br/>
next year. Figure I can maximize my experience in the old world until <br/>
then. There is still plenty to do.<br/>

over 3 years has been a 450 mhz k6-3 box with 256 megs ram, that ran <br/>
ME. Rock solid, reliable, no compatibility issues...it&#39;s great. ME <br/>
has never given me anything like the problems I&#39;ve seen others talk <br/>
about. Only time it ever acted up is when the cpu fan was <br/>
failing....obviously not the OS&#39;s fault. <br/>

will slow down due to windows not being able handle a super amount of <br/>
ram.  just what I have be told by compouter techs.  well see evryone <br/>
