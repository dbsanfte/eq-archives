<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027012240">I hate brownies..<br/>
When I first started playing EverQuest and decided to venture out without my<br/>
sister&#39;s help, I went over to the spires in Gfay. I saw this cute tiny<br/>
person standing there. It said brownie scout over it&#39;s head. I was like &quot;How<br/>
cute! Hello little guy&quot; and walked over to greet it. It started casting a<br/>
spell but I was so new I didn&#39;t know what it was doing. Next thing I know I<br/>
see LOADING PLEASE WAIT.<br/>
That was the first time I died in the game.<br/>
One day, I will have my revenge.<br/>
luv,<br/>

At level 48 the corrupted Brownie killed me and my wife(level 49 warrior).<br/>
LFay is a tricky dangerous place.</div>
