<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406010943"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; well i&#39;m on Mithaniel Marr right now.. starting a<br/>
&gt; char on Firiona Vie though soon.. I really wish<br/>
&gt; everybody roleplayed more.. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mortoner says, in Elvish, &quot;M&#39;Lady, I beg of you to<br/>
&gt; grant me the spirit of wolf.. I have a long journey<br/>
&gt; ahead of me across treacherous lands..&quot;<br/>
&gt; --or--<br/>
&gt; Dikinmyazz tells you, &quot;d00d, can i geta SOW&quot;<br/>
&gt; hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the theory. The practice:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;D00d, can I get a SoW so I can camp that ph4t ub3r<br/>
sp4wn before I level?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;cue large amounts of bickering over a camp on a<br/>
desirable item&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Trivial loot was an absolute failure. :(<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the people begging for SoW&#39;s thing, I don&#39;t<br/>
even think about it anymore, it&#39;s just a reflex. SoW<br/>
anyone who hails, then after that ask if they need<br/>
something. :) Doesn&#39;t bother me in the least, SoW was<br/>
one of the major reasons I decided to start a Druid,<br/>
might as well use it. (plus, considering the amount of<br/>
time i&#39;ve put into playing my rogue, I know how<br/>
frustrating it is being SoW-less) I figure if for<br/>
every fifty SoW&#39;s I cast with my Druid, someone&#39;s alt<br/>
Druid/Shammy will hopefully see fit to give my Rogue<br/>
one, and that&#39;s a damn fine deal. :)<br/>
