I would say my new computer ran 30%-40% faster after I did about 6-8 of<br/>
their recommended tweaks. Just turning off the 12-18 programs XP runs in the<br/>
background will help drastically. <br/>
<br/>
This site also has easy step by step instructions. <br/>

	&quot;They say that Win2000 is much more stable. XP is also an option.<br/>
Not<br/>
	as stable as 2000 and not compatible with alot of software.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;ve not had any problems with compatible softwares. Compatible mode<br/>
has<br/>
	solved those problems that i used to have. Then again, i don&#39;t run<br/>
any 16<br/>
	bit applications.<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;and you have to go into regedit and edit Permissions to allow<br/>
yourself to<br/>
	install software<br/>
	on it. It is a real biyatch sometimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	Wrong, use your admin account to install softwares. It&#39;s much better<br/>
	security to have a regular user account wich you use on regular<br/>
basis and<br/>
	use the admin account when you are installing new softwares. That<br/>
way it<br/>
	will be alot harder for you to fark up your system.<br/>
<br/>
	Another good thing to use is system save, use it when you think your<br/>
system<br/>
	is running well. If you later run into problems you simply load up<br/>
your<br/>
	saved system and are fit for fight again.<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;maybe that info would be at www.tweakui.com?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	No, it&#39;s a reg hack. Altho, WinXX ain&#39;t designed to handle very much<br/>
memory<br/>
	but you can fix it.<br/>

	Definetly ditch ME. Every techie I have talked to has told me how<br/>
unstable<br/>
	it is. They say that Win2000 is much more stable. XP is also an<br/>
option. Not<br/>
	as stable as 2000 and not compatible with alot of software. and you<br/>
have to<br/>
	go into regedit and edit Permissions to allow yourself to install<br/>
software<br/>
	on it. It is a real biyatch sometimes.<br/>

<br/>
	   I have  to agree there 2 GB of ram my system can handle 1.5 gb<br/>
but my<br/>
	OS(win ME) won&#39;t handle that so well by the way SU my Geforce 4 card<br/>
is also<br/>
	64 MB I couldn&#39;t afford the 128 mb card<br/>
