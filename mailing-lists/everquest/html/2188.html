<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EverQuest] Clerics soloing? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-689982243">I soloed some in Lake of Ill omen with my cleric at your level. But I agree<br/>
with previous poster. A group will be a lot more efective, or a twinked monk<br/>
partner (and hell there are a million twinked out monks). <br/>
<br/>
If you wanna try out solo, you should get sow and c/c2 and load your undead<br/>
nukes. Just aim for undeads , the other nukes arent mana effective. Since<br/>
the cleric nuke lines are marred with very high casting time you most of the<br/>
time need to use root and shoot to kill.<br/>
<br/>
It will work, but not the best efficiency. I used to solo while shouting for<br/>
group, that way if i didnt get one i still came home with some exp. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In Kelethin a similar way is to buy CB belts and<br/>
&gt;turn them in in Kaladim. But to get good skills, get<br/>
&gt;in a group and fight on orc hill up to lvl 8<br/>
&gt;then go into CB. Btw, anyone know of a good place a<br/>
&gt;lvl 36 high elf cleric can solo?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll go the obvious route here, &quot;Cleric? Solo?<br/>
Bwahahahahahahahahahaha...&quot;. ;) (hey, my main&#39;s a<br/>
druid, i&#39;ve gotta give all the other non-necro classes<br/>
a hard time about soloing :) Honestly, from what I<br/>
understand (having a friend with a lvl 30 Cleric and<br/>
having talked to/grouped with others), Clerics just<br/>
plain don&#39;t solo past 20. It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to<br/>
find a group though, Clerics of a decent level are<br/>
always in short supply. I&#39;d be inclined to head<br/>
somewhere like Cazic-Thule or Guk. Plenty of yummy<br/>
undead in LGuk, just shout LFG there and max out your<br/>
&quot;Ego&quot; skill while everyone fights over you. :) Of<br/>
course, if you absolutely insist on soloing, hit<br/>
eqatlas.com and take your pick of the 30+ undead heavy<br/>
zones. Personally, i&#39;d rather have a pet warrior or<br/>
two around to soak up the damage though... :)<br/>
