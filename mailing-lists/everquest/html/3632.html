<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031444710">Just wondered if anyone has worked in a group of all one class? Kinda <br/>
been wondering about getting a group of Halfling Druids together to <br/>
tackle the elementals on the island in the Twilight Sea. Plenty of <br/>
power for ports, defeating summond creatures, and healing.<br/>
<br/>
Thought of one as primary porter and evac officer, and back-up <br/>
healer. At least two to dismiss summond, and at least one dedicated <br/>
healer. Seems that a group like this should be able to kill quickly <br/>
and keep mana up enough to continue doing so for some time.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on this?<br/>
