&gt; Ok, I can&#39;t give you an exact formula, nothing is known precisely<br/>
&gt; about the game itself, but I can give you a general indication.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Each piece of armor, in addition to it&#39;s AC value has a value that<br/>
&gt; is not visible which is how much damage it absorbs from attacks.<br/>
&gt; This is apparently chained with the difference between the attackers<br/>
&gt; attack and the defenders defense, so is extremely difficult to put<br/>
&gt; a fixed value on.  This is also the greatest weakness of monks at<br/>
&gt; high levels - they have exceptional AC but almost no absorbance,<br/>
&gt; so get hit for huge amounts when the blow lands.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As an experiment to see the effects, try equipping a full set of cloth<br/>
&gt; armor ( which as far as I can see has negligible absorbance ) and<br/>
&gt; attacking a blue monster to get an idea of how much damage it does,<br/>
&gt; then swap the chest piece for something with good absorbance<br/>
&gt; such as banded. You will notice that the most of the attacks will do<br/>
&gt; the same damage, but every so often the monster will hit for much<br/>
&gt; less - this is when the hit lands on your banded piece.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A full set does not garauntee the lower damage attacks though -<br/>
&gt; a monster of any level always has a chance to do full damage<br/>
&gt; with an attack and a monster with a much higher attack than your<br/>
&gt; defense will almost always bypass your armor when it hits you.<br/>
&gt; Also, your defense is severely decreased when fighting multiple<br/>
&gt; oppponents - as an example with a level 15 necromancer in full<br/>
&gt; woven fighting level 8 skeletons, when fighting one at a time<br/>
&gt; would rarely get hit for more than 1 point of damage ( the minimum<br/>
&gt; for a succesfull hit ) but fighting two at once would frequently get<br/>
&gt; hit<br/>
&gt; for over 10.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Armor with higher AC values *usually* has a better absorbance,<br/>
&gt; but this is not always the case - a good example that springs to<br/>
&gt; mind is the lightweight armors from the innothule swamp/guk area.<br/>
&gt; Woven armor has the same AC as patchwork, but absorbs<br/>
&gt; as much damage as leather does, and mesh has the same AC<br/>
&gt; as leather, but absorbs as much damage as chainmail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I am told that Lockjaw&#39;s tunic and snakeskin armor only<br/>
&gt; absorb damage as well as leather, despite having a much<br/>
&gt; better AC.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; Hey,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have heard about absorbtion of armor, but do not understnad the<br/>
&gt; mechanics/formula/general idea behind it. My deep armor knowledge is<br/>
&gt; confined to games as primal as UO =) Sooo, if you can do a little<br/>
&gt; explanation of the general differences between AC and Absorbtion, I<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; most gracious. And also, will I notice a big difference between no<br/>
&gt; armor<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; my new Bronze (let&#39;s assume it&#39;s a full suit)? I know it should be an<br/>
&gt; obvious yes, but I have been less than enthralled with armor effects<br/>
&gt; in the<br/>
&gt; game so far, and am wondering if I&#39;m going to noticed monsters about<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; level that did 20 or so damage suddenly start doing 4 or 5.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks a bunch again,<br/>
&gt; -Rukkak<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Just to cover my prospective flame bases, nothin against UO. IT is<br/>
&gt; just my<br/>
&gt; personal opinion that EQ is faaaaaar better. =)<br/>

&gt; &gt;Bronze plate, in addition to being extremely heavy, does not<br/>
&gt; &gt;absorb damage as well as normal plate.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;On the heaviness side - 86lb may not seem like much, until<br/>
&gt; &gt;you factor in that you will be carrying at least 10LB of weapons,<br/>
&gt; &gt;4LB of backpacks, several LB of food and drink, every 40 coins<br/>
&gt; &gt;weighs 1B. A full suit really isn&#39;t feasible for anything weaker than<br/>
&gt; &gt;a troll or ogre.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
