<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700931988">I may be incorrect, but:<br/>
Hiding is one of those skills where you don&#39;t know if you&#39;re successful. You think you&#39;re hiding, but you really can&#39;t jump to a third person view to make sure. I have a dark elf character and I like to use hiding quite a bit. I &#39;always&#39; disapear off the screen (because I think I&#39;m really hiding!)<br/>
Also I don&#39;t think the message says &quot;you are hidden&quot; but rather &quot;you begin to hide&quot; or something like that.<br/>

&gt;Greetings All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I have a question to all you woodland elves out there.  Woodelves have the<br/>
&gt;born-with-skill to Hide.  However, when I was watching them play with<br/>
&gt;Hide (they were lvl4-6), I could still see them.  On their screen they were<br/>
&gt;hidden and they can nolonger see their character, but I can see them plainly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Once in awhile I see them disappear, but most of the time I still see them<br/>
&gt;even though they said they got the message &quot;you are hidden&quot; and they can<br/>
&gt;no longer see themselves in any camera view.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Is this a bug, are they doing something wrong, or do Humans have a chance<br/>
&gt;of seeing them even though they are hidden from other eyes?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
