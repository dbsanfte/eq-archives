  <div><br></div><tt>They said it was ok for you to loot though, right?<br>Just 
  bc someone appears to be twinked doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t need money. I<br>had 
  someone who wouldn&#39;t let me loot in group bc he claimed I was twinked. 
  I<br>was around lvl 25 and wearing a Green Silk Drape and poking away with 
  a<br>drachnid leg tip that I bought off a merchant in Neriak. I had no money 
  bc<br>I&#39;d spent it all on spells and the equipment that I had.<br>Sorry, pet 
  peeve. The attitude that someone with good gear doesn&#39;t have<br>money can get 
  you into trouble.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>I made about 300pp in the Highpass 
  Basement just looting everything because<br>everyone else was so twinked they 
  don&#39;t need money.<br>&nbsp; ----- Original Message -----<br>&nbsp; From:

  get sow. So you can<br>&nbsp; sow for donations if no druids, beastlords, or 
  shamans are around.<br>&nbsp; luv,<br>&nbsp; -Su<br><br>&nbsp; I guess the 
  obvious ways I can think of are to kill lots of green mobs.<br>Camp<br>&nbsp; 
  items in dungeons. Practice trade skills. I have spent a great deal 
  of<br>time<br>&nbsp; in the Highpass Basement and when I am in a group where 
  everyone is<br>twinked,<br>&nbsp; they often let me get all the 
  loot.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow"
