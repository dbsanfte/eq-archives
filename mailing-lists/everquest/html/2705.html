<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to agree with those people who 
hate beggers.&nbsp; I was one when I first started out a long timne ago about 
six months after thae game started.&nbsp; Now I help all those I can who do not 
beg.&nbsp; I had a gentleman igve my level 1 wizard a full suit of cloth armor a 
decent weapon and an offer to join a giuld a level 5 and I didn&#39;t even ask him 
for anything all he did was ask what class I was and he gave me the items.&nbsp; 
I was shocked and very grateful.&nbsp; I remember one time I gave a low level 
caster amost a full suit of armor I no longer needed and then about 2 minutes 
later after giving a newbie a rusty axe i saw a shout that they were looking for 
new items and weapons I was upset&nbsp; but all beggers should be taken out and 
given to the ogres for food.</font></div>
