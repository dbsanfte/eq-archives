<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I think you misunderstood.&nbsp; I am NOT the 
naysayer.&nbsp; I was saying that in response to Matt&#39;s email which was largely 
filled with negativism that the game would end in a couple years.&nbsp; The 
point of my post is that I will be playing EQ for as long as EQ is around to be 
played.&nbsp; Be that 2 years, 5 years, or 25 years.&nbsp; The original purpose 
of my EQ math post was to show that IF EQ is around in 25 years then the in-game 
date will have caught up with where EQ2 supposedly begins.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#39;s 
all.&nbsp; The speculation on what would happen to the game within that time 
frame is what brought about the topic of whether or not the game would survive 
that long.&nbsp; Personally, I hope it does.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>No Wulfric, you are not the only naysayer. I just haven&#39;t 
  had a chance<br>to reply yet. LOL<br><br>Like you I do not believe that SOE 
  will get rid of their biggest cash<br>cow, (And still is) I still meet people 
  on a weekly basis (average of at<br>least 10) who are brand new to the game. 
  (EQ1 +/- any scam artists in<br>that bunch)<br><br>EQ1 is still alive and 
  strong, there are no plans for EQ1 to &quot;catch up&quot;<br>with EQ2, thats up to you 
  the individual player to use your imagination<br>and &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; so to 
  speak when you make the switch to EQ2.<br>From the start SOE said that EQ2 is 
  a complete change from EQ1. Also<br>think of it this way, do music groups have 
  the same songs on every<br>album? No. They are always changing to appeal to 
  the masses. If they put<br>the same songs on every album you would eventually 
  get bored with it and<br>every time you hear them on the radio it would be 
  basically the same<br>song but with different words.<br><br>EQ2 is a &quot;sequel&quot; 
  to EQ1 just as &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a &quot;sequel&quot; to<br>&quot;The Matrix&quot;. I&#39;m 
  sure that SOE would like everyone to move over to EQ2<br>but they know and 
  accept the fact that not everyone has a powerful<br>enough computer to run 
  EQ2. I don&#39;t. Plus I have so many things to do in<br>EQ1 first before I move 
  on to another game. Another thing to consider, I<br>have met players who have 
  been in the game for 5 years or more! Imagine<br>the cash SOE has made off 
  these people!<br><br>There will always be new games on the market. Look at 
  WoW, The Matrix,<br>the new D&amp;D game coming out. and one I saw that just 
  looks awesome<br>Lineage II, The graphics are amazing. Honestly if I &quot;had&quot; to 
  switch,<br>thats the one I would go to. Also if you look at MMORPG.com they 
  list<br>Guild Wars as the top game right now plus they list all the MMORPG 
  games<br>out there. (There are more than you think!) So take all those 
  into<br>consideration and then look at how well EQ1 has done compared to all 
  of<br>those others out there. EQ1 is still the giant and will always be 
  a<br>major contender.<br><br>Just my 2 cents<br>Durgaa<br>Ranger of 
  Bristlebane<br>Guild Leader of Mystic Crusaders EQ1 Chapter<br><br>Anyway 
  thats just my 2 cents.<br><br><br><br>EverQuest@yahoogroups.com

  PM<br>&nbsp; Subject: [EverQuest] Re: EQ math<br><br><br>&nbsp; Nah, EQ1 has a 
  remaining life of maybe 2 more years, but that is<br>&nbsp; stretching it a 
  bit.&nbsp; Even as SOEs major flagship game, SOE is seeing<br>&nbsp; the 
  darkness at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; They will be spending more<br>&nbsp; 
  money to maintain the game than they are bringing in with<br>&nbsp; 
  subscriptions dropping more and more each month.&nbsp; I think SOE 
  &quot;may&quot;<br>&nbsp; try to revitilize EQ by releasing a completely new graphics 
  engine<br>&nbsp; and serious upgrade for the game, but this would be optional 
  and only<br>&nbsp; be window dressing since there is not too much they can do 
  with the<br>&nbsp; backend servers without a complete game overhaul, which 
  they just are<br>&nbsp; not going to do.&nbsp; EQ2 was a serious disapointment 
  to them, as the<br>&nbsp; players were already use to EQ1 and the social 
  structure there.&nbsp; It<br>&nbsp; does sadden me a bit that EQ will come to 
  a close, but we all knew it<br>&nbsp; would happen eventually.&nbsp; I doubt 
  SOE will ever cancel EQ completely<br>&nbsp; (at least not for another 5 or so 
  years), but I would imagine the day<br>&nbsp; when new expansion are no longer 
  released, patches are no longer<br>&nbsp; made, and maybe one or two servers 
  are all that are left is not too<br>&nbsp; far around the corner.... like I 
  said, maybe 2 years.<br><br>&nbsp; I doubt there will ever be another game 
  that has the same appeal and<br>&nbsp; drive that SOE captured with EQ1... 
  however I think we might find<br>&nbsp; that another game may come close only 
  after SOE &quot;pulls the plug&quot; on<br>&nbsp; EQ1 and forces everyone to find 
  another game.&nbsp; We may see a game in<br>&nbsp; the future released from 
  SOE along the same genre of EverQuest, but<br>&nbsp; with a completely 
  different story line and perhaps even the same<br>&nbsp; stayability of 
  EverQuest, but I rather doubt it.&nbsp; I think SOE will<br>&nbsp; end up 
  making their bread and butter with shoot-offs of the Star Wars<br>&nbsp; 
  Universe and maybe some other games like they offer on the station<br>&nbsp; 
  website (jeopardy, wheel of fortune, etc), while another game 
  company<br>&nbsp; with the same spirit that SOE had long ago steps up to take 
  the<br>&nbsp; lead.&nbsp; I would say the next big game will be Vanguard : 
  Saga of<br>&nbsp; Heros.&nbsp; I think that Brad and Jeff have both learned a 
  lot from their<br>&nbsp; experience helping shape EverQuest, and Microsoft 
  (one of the biggest<br>&nbsp; backers of Sigil) has learned from its mistakes 
  in the online game<br>&nbsp; field and won&#39;t make the same mistakes 
  again.&nbsp; SOE has started<br>&nbsp; loosing its grip on the market and 
  Microsoft has a habit of stepping<br>&nbsp; in and taking over when something 
  like that happens.&nbsp; I mean look at<br>&nbsp; Nintendo, Sega, and even 
  Sony.&nbsp; They started slipping in the console<br>&nbsp; game industry and 
  Microsoft stepped in with the X-Box and dominated<br>&nbsp; the market by 
  throwing money at the market till they owned it.&nbsp; Now<br>&nbsp; the best 
  graphics for console games out there are on X-Box, even if<br>&nbsp; content 
  is still split evenly but leaning more towards X-Box as time<br>&nbsp; goes 
  on.<br><br>&nbsp; Matt<br>&nbsp; aka Dragowulf Bowcraft (Ranger of The

  &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;You can check it if you want, I haven&#39;t verified 
  it.<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;Soooooooo......<br>&nbsp; &gt; 
  &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;72 X 365 = 26280 minutes real time<br>&nbsp; &gt; 
  &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;26280 /&nbsp; 60 =&nbsp; 438 hours<br>&nbsp; &gt; 
  &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;438&nbsp; /&nbsp; 24 =&nbsp; 18.25 days<br>&nbsp; &gt; 
  &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;18.25 days real time = 1 year on Norrath<br>&nbsp; 
  &gt; &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;or roughly two and a half weeks.<br>&nbsp; &gt; 
  &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;Current game date as of this 
  writing is March 11, 3200.&nbsp; EQ2 is<br>&nbsp; supposed to take place 500 
  years in Norrath&#39;s future.&nbsp; Luclin<br>&nbsp; explodes, Kunark is nowhere 
  to be found.&nbsp; So how long will it take<br>&nbsp; before EQ1 catches up 
  with EQ2??<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;18.25 X 500 = 9125&nbsp; 
  days real time<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;9125&nbsp; /&nbsp; 
  365&nbsp; =&nbsp; 25 years!!!<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; 
  &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; &gt;So if you play EverQuest for 25 years, you will reach 
  the year<br>&nbsp; 3700 game time in which case you should see the moon 
  explode and<br>&nbsp; you&#39;ll know what happened to Kunark.<br>&nbsp; &gt;
