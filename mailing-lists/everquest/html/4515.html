<br/>
Flaming sword of Xuzl that summons a sword onto your target which dies when<br/>
the target dies. It&#39;s a low hp dumb pet that hits for ~70.<br/>
<br/>
They also have an aa skill that summons sword onto a target in the samy way<br/>
that the flaming sowrd of xuzl does.<br/>
<br/>
Both solutions are low hp dumb pets and dies with the target. Situational<br/>
extras kinda, just bonus damage.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As far as I know no matter what class you play that has<br/>
&gt; allows a pet whether<br/>
&gt; you be a BST Sk Necro Shaman Chanter Wiz(?) Mage(?) whatever <br/>
&gt; you are only<br/>
&gt; allowed one pet at a time.  From what I have seen  the higher <br/>
&gt; level spell<br/>
&gt; you cast that is a pet summoning spell that pet is supposed <br/>
&gt; to be better<br/>
&gt; than its lower level equivalent.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do wizzies get a pet they can use in combat? my wizzy is<br/>
only 51 and the two familiars she has are only a &quot;visible buff&quot;. and i<br/>
didn&#39;t check for the later spells.<br/>
<br/>
also i think clerics get sort of an pet: the &quot;animated&quot; hammer... but i<br/>
don&#39;t know if you can count it as a pet :-)<br/>
<br/>
as a chanter you have two kinds of pets: the animations<br/>
and charmed mobs. you can&#39;t have both of them at the same time... only one<br/>
pet.<br/>
<br/>
necros and mages (as the main pet users) can only have<br/>
one pet at a time... (verant introduced a bug after a<br/>
patch some time ago, where you could have more pets, but<br/>
they &quot;fixed&quot; it within 30 minutes :-((().<br/>
<br/>
mages can also get a &quot;planar ability&quot; at 63 named<br/>
&quot;Host of Elements&quot;: this is the only way to &quot;summon&quot;<br/>
more than one elemental at a time (3 ranks availible<br/>
summoning 5, 7, or 9 elements for 30 seconds, reuse<br/>
time is 22 minutes).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
about the strength of pets (and i can only speak for<br/>
mages, necros, chanters): yes, they get better until<br/>
50... the pets after 50 get tricky sometimes. i think<br/>
the problems were introduced by adding the expansions.<br/>
first the max level was 50 and verant said they will<br/>
never raise that limit. then they added 51 to 60 and<br/>
recently 61 to 65.<br/>
<br/>
this leads to different situations: in &quot;old world&quot; zones<br/>
it is possible to hunt mob with 2 people that needed a<br/>
raid force in the old days (phinny for example). and<br/>
some of the newer zones are much tougher than the old ones.<br/>
<br/>
so especially as a mage, you have to know when to use<br/>
which pet... if you use a pet at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
just some thoughts... ;-)<br/>
