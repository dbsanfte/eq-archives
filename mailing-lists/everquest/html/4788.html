 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s just a personal style. It&#39;s like finding pickles in a cheese burger. <br/>
Some people hate em. Some people like em. Some people don&#39;t care. The <br/>
alternate style in spelling makes the words a little bit harder to follow <br/>
for people who aren&#39;t used to the style. That annoys some people because is <br/>
slows down their reading and they get no pleasure out of the style. Other <br/>
people think it&#39;s cool. I&#39;ll take my cheese burgers with or without <br/>
pickles. It&#39;s no skin off of my nose to let people enjoy what they enjoy. <br/>
Sometimes people just happen to like things that I don&#39;t. What&#39;s wrong with <br/>
that? Not a thing. I wish them all well. Have fun everyone.<br/>
