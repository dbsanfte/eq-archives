<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010719167">I vaguely recall that hubs are slower than routers so routers are the way to<br/>
go.<br/>
winxp network thingy is really pissy. sometimes you have to reboot multiple<br/>
times or even run the network setup wizard over and over to keep it working.<br/>
It is a royal pain. Lately mine has been ok though.<br/>
Oh, as for finding routers you can look them up at www.pricegrabber.com. It<br/>
lets you add in your zip code to factor in shipping costs. It sorts by the<br/>
best price and has customer ratings on the products as well as customer<br/>
ratings of the stores that are offering it. So if the lowest priced store<br/>
has a bad rating, you can choose to get one slightly more expensive at a<br/>
more reliable store. I personally like yesmicro.com. I&#39;ve ordered from them<br/>
numerous times. I think with yesmicro you get a discount if you order a<br/>
product after locating it on www.pricewatch.com. I tend to look for it on<br/>
pricegrabber then check for it on pricewatch. Another site for info on<br/>
products is www.epinions.com. I tend to use all 3 to help determine what<br/>
product I want.<br/>

Yeah I supose you could do that with a standard networking hub, but best bet<br/>
is to go with a router.  Usually doesn&#39;t require any extra software, it&#39;s<br/>
easy to configure, and most of them have built in firewalls.    I&#39;ve never<br/>
heard of SyGate, but Windows ME/XP both have something called Internet<br/>
Connection sharing which essentially sets up a proxy server ont he host<br/>
machine and allows all the others to connect through it.  I used it before<br/>
and its okay but a little tempermental at times when you start adding 3rd<br/>
party firewall software to the mix.  I&#39;d still reccomend going with a<br/>
router.  Small 4 port routers aren&#39;t that expensive.  You can pick them up<br/>
at Best buy or Comp USA for less than $60.  Just make sure you know what<br/>
you&#39;re getting.<br/>
