<div id="ygrps-yiv-99063608"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &quot;They say that Win2000 is much more stable. XP is also an option. Not<br/>
&gt; as stable as 2000 and not compatible with alot of software.&quot;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve not had any problems with compatible softwares. Compatible mode has<br/>
&gt; solved those problems that i used to have. Then again, i don&#39;t run any 16<br/>
&gt; bit applications.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had lots of problems with it saying it wouldn&#39;t run on Windows NT (bc<br/>
the software mistakes XP for NT).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;and you have to go into regedit and edit Permissions to allow yourself to<br/>
&gt; install software<br/>
&gt; on it. It is a real biyatch sometimes.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Wrong, use your admin account to install softwares. It&#39;s much better<br/>
&gt; security to have a regular user account wich you use on regular basis and<br/>
&gt; use the admin account when you are installing new softwares. That way it<br/>
&gt; will be alot harder for you to fark up your system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not wrong, I was logged in with admin account and it would not let me<br/>
install software. I am the only user of my computer. I even logged in as<br/>
admin and it said I did not have the authority to install software. I had to<br/>
go into regedit and modify Permissions.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;maybe that info would be at www.tweakui.com?&quot;<br/>
&gt; No, it&#39;s a reg hack. Altho, WinXX ain&#39;t designed to handle very much<br/>
 </span></blockquote>memory<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but you can fix it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Tweak has info on reg hacks to make tweak the systems.<br/>
