<div id="ygrps-yiv-354476089">The past two replies were both right. On the server I started on, I <br/>
had NEVER heard that phrase before. On the server I play on now, it&#39;s <br/>
quite common to hear that. If you ever used to frequent chat rooms, <br/>
remember how people used to say &quot;asl check&quot;? It&#39;s the same stupid <br/>
thing. I hate when people do that. All it means is people have an <br/>
open spot in their group, so they&#39;re looking for a suitable person to <br/>
occupy the spot. Maybe I&#39;m old-fashioned, but I still stick with &quot;Is <br/>
there anyone lfg?&quot;...<br/>
