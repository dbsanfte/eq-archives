&gt; &gt; Well, I don&#39;t even have 2k and I&#39;m lvl 54. I hardly ever get to loot bc<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; my connection speed. People always beat me to the corpses. So I&#39;m lucky<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; make 10p in several hours of camping. I think I made about 50p camping<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; SolA for 26 hours. I&#39;m generally busy healing or medding so the tanks<br/>
&gt; &gt; usually get the loot anyways. Plus I&#39;m not that aggressive about loot.<br/>
&gt; there are tradeskills as well: i sold heady kiolas to get the money for<br/>
&gt; the two horses i have. i takes some time to make them and it also<br/>
&gt; may take some days to sell them (on vendor in bazaar), but it is sort<br/>
&gt; of easy money. the only drawback: you hate doing it! hint: never start<br/>
&gt; to count the clicks you have to do!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I suck at selling and can&#39;t go into the bazaar anymore. Sharing a network<br/>
with 4 computers with only a 19.2kbps connection really really blows. I<br/>
can&#39;t even play EQ if one person has a text based rpg going on online now.<br/>
:-(<br/>
Which means I haven&#39;t been able to play for quite awhile...<br/>
I&#39;m still using heady kiolas to try to get tailoring up to move on to do the<br/>
6th shawl. I have everything I need to make it except the skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i fill my trader with two or three bags full of heady kiola. it takes<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; 45 minutes to fill one bag, that&#39;s 10 stacks, eg 200 per bag. on tarew<br/>
&gt; you can set prices to 3pp to 5pp per piece. i have seen people buying<br/>
&gt; them off me instead from cheaper vendors, because i had many stacks,<br/>
&gt; and not &quot;only&quot; less then 20 on me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Man I wish I could use the bazaar....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; another item are some furs/pelts used for tradeskills or quests, for<br/>
example<br/>
&gt;  in WW wolves drop a pelt, that is sold for 400pp to 600pp each. well,<br/>
&gt; some still ask for 1000pp for it (i believe it is used for blacksmithing).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Wow. WW is what now? warsilk woods? What lvl are they?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; tradeskills got really complex! allakhazam has a nice feature showing<br/>
&gt; the full &quot;chain&quot; of items needed. for example have a look at the<br/>
&gt; recipe for a &quot;Fearful Darkly Pulsing Orb&quot;:<br/>
&gt;     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/recipe.html?recipe=2529">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/recipe.html?recipe=2529</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
Cool!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the problem is: are there people around who will by this thing?<br/>
&gt; is it worth to &quot;hunt&quot; for some components which can be considered<br/>
&gt; rare drops, or are off mobs in &quot;not-so-easy-zones&quot; (not everyone<br/>
&gt; can hunt in cazic for example).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; also bazaar is somewhat &quot;ugly&quot; about prices, on the other hand<br/>
&gt; you also can be very lucky in there. let&#39;s go back to the example<br/>
&gt; from the start: one weekend (fr to mo morning) i sold about 1500<br/>
&gt; heady kiolas (and i couldn&#39;t click anymore), then it took about<br/>
&gt; 5 days to sell 200 again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Again, this would work if I could actually go to the bazaar and not go LD<br/>
within 2 seconds. That is the longest I have been able to be in the bazaar<br/>
in months. and then had to get GM to move me bc I couldn&#39;t even make it to<br/>
the zone. As soon as I tried to move I got black screen and &quot;YOU HAVE BEEN<br/>
DISCONNECTED&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; when i bought my first horse (proud to be able to spent 9k) i<br/>
&gt; witnessed when a monk bought a 100k horse for his girlfriend.<br/>
&gt; nice gift indeed... could really need such friends as well... ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I need nice friends like that...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; one more hint about bazaar: hit F9 (or was it F10) to look<br/>
&gt; from above to ground. it isn&#39;t easy to &quot;navigate&quot;, but the &quot;speed&quot;<br/>
&gt; improvement is worth it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Yeah, but by the time I can actually hit a key I&#39;m kicked. :-( It takes me<br/>
10 minutes to zone in and then boom. disconnected.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; another hint about gfx: i only enable &quot;new models&quot; for the chars<br/>
&gt; that have horses. all other additional features are turned off.<br/>
&gt; zoning is faster, and i have less &quot;gfx lag&quot;. i only have P3 systems<br/>
&gt; with 512MB, but that way i could play much smoother again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I disabled most models. I have an AMD Athlon 1.4Ghz processor and 1GB of DDR<br/>
SDRAM. But I still get kicked from bazaar bc of my internet connection.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ooops ... i have to stop now... getting late to work, again...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
heh. Have fun at work!<br/>
luv,<br/>
