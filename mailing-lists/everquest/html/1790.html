<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196882379">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone could give me some suggestions on armor for a 15th<br/>
lvl halfling druid.  I&#39;ve got a lumberjack&#39;s cap, splitpaw gloves, and a<br/>
brown chitin protector right now, but everything else is leather armor.<br/>
I&#39;ve also got a black enameled mace.  What sort of upgrades would make the<br/>
most sense right now?  Is there a piece or two of armor that I can&#39;t live<br/>
without?  I can&#39;t afford anything in the thousands, but I could swing a<br/>
couple hundred plats or a bit more for a good piece of armor.  I know it&#39;s<br/>
been said that I won&#39;t melee much after lvl 20, but I still want to keep up<br/>
my battle skills.  Besides, I mostly solo and enjoy banging on something<br/>
every once in a while when its hps have gotten low.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on Terris Thule, by the way :)</div>
