<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596989606">I was also told that there were 6 spells for each level (at least for cleric class). So you should need 6 of each. I don&#39;t think you ever get repeat spells though. The spells themselves are no drop.<br/>

We&#39;re largely in the same boat, but what I do know is that there are 3 types of runes that drop.  Minor Muramite runes, Lesser Muramite Runes, and Greater Muramite Runes.  Minor runes are for levels 66-67, lesser are for 67-68, and greater are for 69-70.  There is an NPC in Draniks Scar you turn the runes into in order to get the spells.  The name escapes me but it&#39;s an Iksar NPC off to the west of the POD zone in in Dranik&#39;s.  Hope that helps.<br/>
