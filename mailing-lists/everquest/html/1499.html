<br>$10 a month when you can buy Final Fantasy, Legend of Zelda or any number
<br>of other &quot;kill-loot-level&quot; fantasy games. &nbsp;At least then you only spend
<br>your money once. &nbsp;Plus, you don&#39;t have to deal with lag, ridiculously long
<br>loading screens between zones and you can pause if you want to go grab a
<br>soda or hit the bathroom.
<br>
<br>The beauty of the online experience, as I see it, is that beyond the rules
<br>and the imagination of the developers and artists who made the game, you
<br>also have the total combined imaginations of literally thousands of
<br>players. &nbsp;Of course, that only works if other players are, in fact, being
<br>creative...
