<b>Subject:</b> Goodies from Greenies <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-790333108">I have been researching some items I can hunt while foraging some <br/>
things needed for my epic, should I ever go for that pinacle.<br/>
<br/>
Some things I wish to hunt are dropped by greenies. I was just <br/>
wondering if the rare drops still drop from greenies, or if the rumor <br/>
is true that, if you don&#39;t get experience you can&#39;t get a rare drop.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know the status of the rules on this subject?<br/>
