<div id="ygrps-yiv-872383687">Hail all;<br/>
   I just wanted to send a brief introduction..I haven&#39;t been playing <br/>
long, just a few months and I tend to be a casual player. I play on <br/>
Xegony and have 2 Toons there..Kailerii, Necromancer of the 10th Rank <br/>
and a Barbarian Bst who is 7th rank. I also have a Bazaar Trader who <br/>
is Vah-Shir.<br/>
<br/>
   My Main, for now anyway, is my DE Necro who is a member of <br/>
Darkmoon, however since I still enjoy playing both, and have yet to <br/>
try any of the other race/class combos I haven&#39;t definitively set Kai <br/>
as my Main.<br/>
<br/>
  In rl I have 2 children (2 and 11) and a wonderful Fiance who has <br/>
promised to get me the Plat Edition once I get a Toon to 20. I live <br/>
in NNY about 35 minutes from the Canadian border.<br/>
<br/>
   Looking forward to getting to know you and perhaps hunting with <br/>
some of you on Xegony..feel free to send a tell if you play that <br/>
server..will most likely be on Kailerii for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                           May your travels keep you safe;<br/>
                                   Kailerii..DE Necro of the 10th Rank<br/>
