<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307470112">When you&#39;re fighting something, and you&#39;re so close to killing it, and a<br/>
guard or whatever comes along and deals the last blow, kills it, and it<br/>
vanishes....does that count like it killed it from beginning to end?<br/>
Doesn&#39;t it count if you do more than 50% of the damage to the critter?</div>
