&gt; Subject: A CLERIC&#39;S DAY (a short story)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A CLERIC&#39;S DAY<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The morning comes too soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was another bad night, tortured by the haunted screams, and the<br/>
&gt; vivid images of the previous day. My heart is tired, but I must not<br/>
&gt; falter. I met my comrades on the field. Still and quiet. Only the<br/>
&gt; crickets give evidence of life beyond our keep. Today will be another<br/>
&gt; rough day. I bolster my faith, surrounding myself with it like a<br/>
&gt; piece of impregnable armor. I know that many will go out to meet<br/>
&gt; their death and only a few will return. For all our sakes, I must put<br/>
&gt; that aside and mourn later. For now it is war. I am needed to give<br/>
&gt; heart, faith and healing to my comrades. If I must, I will help as<br/>
&gt; well. Not that someone like me could do much. I pray to Tunare for<br/>
&gt; strength and guidance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All communications are in and the report is not good. Our scouts have<br/>
&gt; given us a target. An army of orcs is controlling the southern path<br/>
&gt; letting us know that we shall not pass. Our troops are ready to move<br/>
&gt; out. I only pray that everyone will return. I look at the faces of<br/>
&gt; those with me, those in my group and those beyond. They are anxious.<br/>
&gt; They know the risks and yet the shouts and glory of victory drive<br/>
&gt; them like a cruel master. They look to me for comfort and to keep<br/>
&gt; them going. I hope I do not fail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We reach the gate, but the enemy is nowhere to be seen. The stink is<br/>
&gt; fresh. Do we venture forth or stay behind where it is safe? Our<br/>
&gt; orders are clear, we must continue forward. We must keep them from<br/>
&gt; penning between our keep and their forces. Group by group we venture<br/>
&gt; forward along the path.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A flash of light and some music. I can&#39;t move. The brutishness of our<br/>
&gt; foes keeps me rooted in place. All around me I hear the screams of<br/>
&gt; agony mixed with their terrible howls of victory. The orcs have<br/>
&gt; surrounded us cutting off our escape route. I see my friends and<br/>
&gt; fellow fighters going down one by one under the cruel swords of the<br/>
&gt; brutish orcs. I am helpless. I see them looking to for help and it<br/>
&gt; breaks my heart. How cruel this enemy is, to leave me with sight and<br/>
&gt; hearing, yet deprive me of movement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I feel my hands start to glow. I begin the motions, healing as I can,<br/>
&gt; trying to heal those around me that are still standing. I once again<br/>
&gt; summon my faith to provide a bunker for those left as I race to save<br/>
&gt; those who may yet be living. Frantically, I race against time to save<br/>
&gt; one then another hoping I can stay strong. Our enemies, those that<br/>
&gt; threaten my homeland, are strong. I am not sure how much longer I can<br/>
&gt; hold out. I can feel the energy draining away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Behind me I hear the sound of fresh troops bearing down on us and I<br/>
&gt; send a hurried prayer of thanks to Tunare. Re-enforcements have<br/>
&gt; arrived. Somewhere inside me, I find the power to continue healing<br/>
&gt; and bolstering as much as I can. I watch as our enemies slowly fall<br/>
&gt; beneath our forces until there are none left. Gratefully, I regroup.<br/>
&gt; Looking around, I see that most of us still live. Able to return to<br/>
&gt; our keep victorious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are celebrations, joyful reunions and tales to be told. I hang<br/>
&gt; back. Today we were lucky; tomorrow we will face death again. How can<br/>
&gt; we hold out? I don&#39;t know, but I cannot give up the faith.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is my calling.<br/>
&gt; My vocation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a cleric.<br/>
