I don&#39;t believe you&#39;re doing anything wrong.<br/>
The skill cap on alchemy is your lvl MINUS 24 times 5.<br/>
<br/>
This means your skill cap is 25 - 24 = 1 and 1 x 5 = 5, which means<br/>
you maxed it already.<br/>
<br/>
This why many people suggest waiting till about lvl 29 before<br/>
starting alchemy.<br/>

  Shar Vahl essence is used by shamans in the higher level potions.<br/>
  O.K. new question. on advanceing in skills I am a 25 level Bar. shaman and<br/>
just started makeing potions.. I put 5 points in to Alchemy and started<br/>
making the lowest stuff.  I got about a 25% fail rate and got 5x10 use +5<br/>
str and dex potions. and 2 x 10 &quot;blood of the wolf&quot; potions (at a 50% fail<br/>
rate) I spent about 500 pp and did not get one point advancement in alchemy.<br/>
What am I doing wrong?<br/>
