master looting works well, if you can get someone who can keep up...I&#39;ve<br/>
learned to like it best, as I tend to be a slow looter and in FFA that<br/>
usually means getting left out...I usually decline to be ML tho, as I have<br/>
too hard a time keeping up<br/>

  Subject: [EverQuest] About loot order<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems with<br/>
  loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br/>
  healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br/>
  totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>
  loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they<br/>
care<br/>
  about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>
  &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>
  chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>
  still loot out of turn.<br/>
  And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>
  When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>
  ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>
  picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>
expensive<br/>
  item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>
  bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>
  for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
  Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
  What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
  Just wondering.<br/>
  luv,<br/>
  -Su<br/>
  ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>
  people cooperate.<br/>
