Subject: Week of War<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen or heard of any events going on for this?  I remember <br/>
around the time Stormhammer was opened they had a week of adventure.  <br/>
I could get into a war!<br/>

I&#39;ve seen a few messages but no events yet.  Last GM event I got to participate in was at Halloween.  Got a million bone chips from Qeynos Hills but some idiot kept killing the named and stopping the event.  Everyone wanted to kill that guy but he wouldn&#39;t accept the duels.<br/>
