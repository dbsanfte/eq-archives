------------------------------ <br/>
<br/>
** Bug Fixes ** <br/>
<br/>
- Fixed a bug that allowed items to be placed in the wrong equipment slots <br/>
- Fixed a problem that some folks had with polygons and clipping using the<br/>
Matrox Parhelia card <br/>
<br/>
** Spells ** <br/>
<br/>
- Changed Luclin port spells to be usable from anywhere <br/>
- Added new Druid and Wizard transportation spells for locations in Luclin <br/>
<br/>
** Items ** <br/>
<br/>
- Removed the cap for items that granted bonus mana <br/>
- Bricks of Black Acrylia are now stackable <br/>
- Plains Pebbles are now stackable <br/>
- Casserole Dish Sketches are now stackable <br/>
- Yttrium Sleeves and Leggings now have a plate armor appearance. They are<br/>
also no drop <br/>
<br/>
** New User Interface ** <br/>
<br/>
- New Interface Window: The Compass! Press Alt-D to activate it. The higher<br/>
your Sense Heading skill is, the more responsive and accurate the compass is<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed the fatigue percentage Label to show 100% when you are not fatigued<br/>
at all <br/>
- Clicking to add new items to a stack in your inventory will now stack<br/>
those items into the inventory rather than onto the cursor <br/>
- Fixed a bug that was causing some people to lose items when looting too<br/>
quickly <br/>
- Tracking window no longer shifts to the top every time an NPC dies <br/>
- Training window no longer only shows the first digit of the amount needed<br/>
to pay for training <br/>
- Fixed the bug that was causing left clicking during mouselook to target <br/>
- The &#39;hits mode&#39; menu and filtering for it is done, including the options<br/>
for normal, abbreviated and number/miss only for the six main melee filters <br/>
<br/>
- UI Skin Creators: We added the following EQType labels: <br/>
71 = Current AA pts available to spend <br/>
72 = Current exp % being assigned to AA <br/>
73 = Last Name of the player <br/>
<br/>
- Alternate Skin Users: You may need to return to the default interface<br/>
until the skin that you are using has been updated to work with the latest<br/>
client. The addition of the new Compass window as well as some other changes<br/>
may cause problems with skins for older patches of EverQuest. If you<br/>
experience odd interface behavior or crashes, please try /LOADSKIN DEFAULT<br/>
to return to the default skin. <br/>
<br/>
** Bazaar ** <br/>
<br/>
- The Bazaar Search Window is resizable (added in an earlier patch) <br/>
- PCs can&#39;t beg or pickpocket from NPC&#39;s and PC&#39;s in the bazaar (added in an<br/>
earlier patch) <br/>
- The Trader drop down box is now sorted alphabetically <br/>
<br/>
** Alternate Advancement ** <br/>
<br/>
- Priests and intelligence casters now have the Combat Stability and Natural<br/>
Durability Alternate Advancement abilities in their Archetype <br/>
<br/>
** Miscellaneous ** <br/>
<br/>
- Reduced the faction hit for the final turn in on the Wizard Epic quest <br/>
- Implemented key rings. Certain keys will be placed on your key ring when<br/>
you use them (like clicking on the appropriate doors or locks). The keyring<br/>
is a part of the character, not a space in inventory. To find out what keys<br/>
you have just type /key and the game will give you a list <br/>
- Moved the safe point in Marus Seru to a somewhat safer spot <br/>
<br/>
** From Neriak ** <br/>
<br/>
An uncharacteristic silence descended across the Imperial District of<br/>
Neriak, city of the Prince of Hate&#39;s children. Not so much an absence of<br/>
sound, more the oppression of pure silence; an almost tangible potential<br/>
crackling in the air itself, as a quiet before a tumultuous storm. <br/>
<br/>
Nobles and commoners alike stood motionless in the streets, a look of<br/>
confused expectation upon their upturned faces. The ghouls guarding the<br/>
entrance of the Dark Academy chittered briefly to one another before melting<br/>
into the shadows. <br/>
<br/>
All eyes looked upon the Dark Tower of Sorcery, it&#39;s smooth stone walls<br/>
seeming to almost pulse with a power from within. Darkened windows and<br/>
oriels looked out upon the silent city of the Tier&#39;dal, imparting an<br/>
impression of amused malice. <br/>
<br/>
Silence... interminable, suffocating silence... instantly broken by a<br/>
deafening, mind-rending thundercrack, reverberating from the cavernous walls<br/>
of the city, shaking the very foundation of every building with immense<br/>
force. Blinding luminance, lancing forth from every aperture in the tower,<br/>
burning the eyes of those foolish enough to look on, whilst the thundercrack<br/>
pained each listener&#39;s ears. <br/>
<br/>
Then, as soon as the cataclysmic burst had come, it vanished. The ringing in<br/>
the ears of every dark elf within the streets below slowly subsided, to be<br/>
replaced by a lone, maniacal stream of laughter echoing throughout the city<br/>
from the Dark Tower&#39;s summit... <br/>
