<div id="ygrps-yiv-688034979">I have found the path. I have hunted in Permafrost for a while, of <br/>
and on. When I get lucky I can follow some higher level hunters <br/>
seeking particular drops. I get the left-overs. I have netted some hq <br/>
ore this way. Lots of other good stuff, as well. Gotten a bit of <br/>
money for permafrost crystals. Sold lots of armor bagged there.<br/>
<br/>
The profits have been invested in buying fs weapons in SK. I pay a <br/>
fair price of 5pp each, and take the items home to Rivervale.<br/>
<br/>
One fs weapon plus one flask of water in the forge nets a small block <br/>
of ore. <br/>
<br/>
Small block of ore plus a smithing chisel nets two pieces of hq ore.<br/>
<br/>
Two pieces of hq ore plus one flask of water nets a bit of hq metal.<br/>
Or was it two bits? Can&#39;t remember right now.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the a bit of hq metal, plus a thimble mold, needle mold, and <br/>
a flask of water in the Vale Forge gets me... smithing experience. I <br/>
have not yet succeeded in making my Vale Sewing Kit, but I am closing <br/>
on the prize. After that, those nice 100% weight reduction bags. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, the wealth this Halfling shall find after that.<br/>
<br/>
Strange, I am not an optimist in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Hmph.<br/>
