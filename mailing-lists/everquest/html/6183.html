<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744416874">Hey Matt, <br/>
<br/>
Good to see you&#39;re still into the game.  I&#39;m wondering if you happen to<br/>
have some inside information here or if this is your impression from all<br/>
you&#39;ve heard and read etc...  <br/>
<br/>
I tend to take what you say about the game somewhat seriously, but some<br/>
whould say Im just a gullible guy. Haha.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for adding your thoughts and hope you&#39;re doing well out there.<br/>

<br/>
Nah, EQ1 has a remaining life of maybe 2 more years, but that is<br/>
stretching it a bit.  Even as SOEs major flagship game, SOE is seeing<br/>
the darkness at the end of the tunnel.  They will be spending more money<br/>
to maintain the game than they are bringing in with subscriptions<br/>
dropping more and more each month.  I think SOE &quot;may&quot; <br/>
try to revitilize EQ by releasing a completely new graphics engine and<br/>
serious upgrade for the game, but this would be optional and only be<br/>
window dressing since there is not too much they can do with the backend<br/>
servers without a complete game overhaul, which they just are not going<br/>
to do.  EQ2 was a serious disapointment to them, as the players were<br/>
already use to EQ1 and the social structure there.  It does sadden me a<br/>
bit that EQ will come to a close, but we all knew it would happen<br/>
eventually.  I doubt SOE will ever cancel EQ completely (at least not<br/>
for another 5 or so years), but I would imagine the day when new<br/>
expansion are no longer released, patches are no longer made, and maybe<br/>
one or two servers are all that are left is not too far around the<br/>
corner.... like I said, maybe 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt there will ever be another game that has the same appeal and<br/>
drive that SOE captured with EQ1... however I think we might find that<br/>
another game may come close only after SOE &quot;pulls the plug&quot; on<br/>
EQ1 and forces everyone to find another game.  We may see a game in the<br/>
future released from SOE along the same genre of EverQuest, but with a<br/>
completely different story line and perhaps even the same stayability of<br/>
EverQuest, but I rather doubt it.  I think SOE will end up making their<br/>
bread and butter with shoot-offs of the Star Wars Universe and maybe<br/>
some other games like they offer on the station website (jeopardy, wheel<br/>
of fortune, etc), while another game company with the same spirit that<br/>
SOE had long ago steps up to take the lead.  I would say the next big<br/>
game will be Vanguard : Saga of Heros.  I think that Brad and Jeff have<br/>
both learned a lot from their experience helping shape EverQuest, and<br/>
Microsoft (one of the biggest backers of Sigil) has learned from its<br/>
mistakes in the online game field and won&#39;t make the same mistakes<br/>
again.  SOE has started loosing its grip on the market and Microsoft has<br/>
a habit of stepping in and taking over when something like that happens.<br/>
I mean look at Nintendo, Sega, and even Sony.  They started slipping in<br/>
the console game industry and Microsoft stepped in with the X-Box and<br/>
dominated the market by throwing money at the market till they owned it.<br/>
Now the best graphics for console games out there are on X-Box, even if<br/>
content is still split evenly but leaning more towards X-Box as time<br/>
goes on.<br/>

&gt; Oh cool!!<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though. Plus EQ2<br/>
could be considered a parrallel universe. <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t know Luclin had exploded in EQ2. Did they say the story<br/>
behind why? What happened to the poor Vah Shir?<br/>
&gt; I imagine in 25 years the game interfaces will be much more<br/>
advanced. Maybe there will be EQ 1.5 or 1.9A or something. :-D<br/>

&gt; &gt;72 minutes real time = 1 day game time<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You can check it if you want, I haven&#39;t verified it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Soooooooo......<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;72 X 365 = 26280 minutes real time<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;26280 /  60 =  438 hours<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;438  /  24 =  18.25 days<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;18.25 days real time = 1 year on Norrath<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;or roughly two and a half weeks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Current game date as of this writing is March 11, 3200.  EQ2 is<br/>
supposed to take place 500 years in Norrath&#39;s future.  Luclin explodes,<br/>
Kunark is nowhere to be found.  So how long will it take before EQ1<br/>
catches up with EQ2??<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;18.25 X 500 = 9125  days real time<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;9125  /  365  =  25 years!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So if you play EverQuest for 25 years, you will reach the year<br/>
3700 game time in which case you should see the moon explode and you&#39;ll<br/>
know what happened to Kunark.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Cool huh?<br/>
