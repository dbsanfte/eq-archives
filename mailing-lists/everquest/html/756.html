<div id="ygrps-yiv-945215390">Now that you mention it....<br/>
Me and a friend created each a human paladin in freeport, with the purpose of annoying everyone with silly names dueling.. We put the bonus point the same and we didn&#39;t kill anything or gained any exp or levels.. Simple level 1 characters wearing nothing and wielding the newbie sword.. We dueled about 5 times and EVERY time I beat the crap out of him by far, I didn&#39;t even loose half my hitpoints in any of the duels.. It COULD however be just a fluke.. Btw the characters were the same gender..<br/>

&gt; It could also be a possibility that there are certain stats randomly created when<br/>
&gt; you make a character that we are unaware of. Verant has said that as a part of<br/>
&gt; the game they don&#39;t want people to know exactly how combat and damage work, and<br/>
&gt; there could be a slight difference in your to-hit and damage calculations from<br/>
&gt; some unknown variables<br/>

&gt; &gt; LOL!  OH!  For a minute there  you had me scared!  I in NO way<br/>
&gt; &gt; intended to imply favoritism (though one of my friends claims I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; just &quot;smiled upon by the Gods&quot; and my husband was not &lt;G&gt;).  However,<br/>
&gt; &gt; as you mentioned, I wouldn&#39;t put it completely past them.  I have even<br/>
&gt; &gt; heard rumor (strictly hearsay) that Verant at first  had no intention<br/>
&gt; &gt; of having the armor &quot;show&quot; on female characters....  So the guys down<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the design and programming department may have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few...preferences...they&#39;re entertaining. &lt;bg&gt;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But...Now that you mention it, I may have to create two new<br/>
&gt; &gt; male/female characters with identical stats just to see what<br/>
&gt; &gt; happens... :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;i think the biggest point here is that as far as she can tell, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;characters are matched except for gender.  wouldn&#39;t it be one sick joke if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Verant had been nerfing the genders differently all along so that the female<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;is easier to play than her male equivalent?  this would definitely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;demonstrate an evil intent by Verant to undermind the family unit and i<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;would have to report them to the appropriate conservative left wing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;factions....just kidding.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;really wouldn&#39;t put it past them though...seriously<br/>
