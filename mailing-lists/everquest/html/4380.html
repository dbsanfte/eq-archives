<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055507822"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have a question. I enjoy being an Enchantress because I am looking <br/>
&gt; forward to some of the cool spells that I will eventually get (Charm, <br/>
&gt; KEI, etc.) I just made Level 10 and am scared to death now because <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m afraid of getting killed, not being able to get back to my <br/>
&gt; corpse, and losing all my stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>getting killed is part of the game: don&#39;t be afraid of it! there are only<br/>
a few zones where it is almost impossible to get back your corpse.<br/>
but if you really have equipment that must be recovered there are<br/>
three classes who you should be looking for:<br/>
 - rogues: if you know the location where you died, but other<br/>
   classes have problems to get there and back again, get an<br/>
   rogue. the sneak&hide makes them invisible to most of the<br/>
   critters throughout the world.<br/>
 - necros & SKs: they can summon a corpse ... it isn&#39;t cheap,<br/>
   but before you will loose some &quot;special&quot; items, they can help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I joined a website that lists quests and the levels you can complete <br/>
&gt; the quests at, the site says you can complete the Stein of Moggok <br/>
&gt; quest at level 8. I have components to make a Stein of Moggok, have <br/>
&gt; the book to get another Stein, but when I try to give bartender Clurg <br/>
&gt; the book, his body guard knocks me on my butt. And I can&#39;t use the <br/>
&gt; Dark Elf Ill. spell until level 12, so why does everyone say that you <br/>
&gt; can finish the quest at 8?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>looks like you read many postings of inkies ... ;-)<br/>
yes, you are right, if you aren&#39;t a dark elf, you have to wait until 12.<br/>
but wait ... where is Clurg now? the trolls had to leave their home<br/>
tome and have to stay in neriak now ... %-&<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are there any other quests that low-level Enchantress&#39;s can do to get <br/>
&gt; nice equipment, money and experience?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my chantress is sort of an extra rare played alt. i don&#39;t know how i raised<br/>
her to 40. i never had to care about money with her, because she is pretty<br/>
much sponsored by my main... i started some quests with her, which i found<br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</a> , but she got help from my main most<br/>
of the time. sorry, i can&#39;t help you much here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
good luck<br/>
