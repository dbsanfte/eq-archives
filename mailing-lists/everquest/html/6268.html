<div id="ygrps-yiv-365987354">Ahhh the old head in your way when you cast trick.....you can do away <br/>
with that if you have an enchanter in the group or if you have an <br/>
illusion mask....if you have a horse ....cast your horse....then <br/>
either click your illusion mask or have an enchanter cast an illusion <br/>
on you....then after the illusion is on you....just click the <br/>
illusion off and your horses head will disappear from your <br/>
screen....its a neat little trick to be able to see a little better.--<br/>
