<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745702358">It&#39;s not just tradeskills. It&#39;s alot of hunting in weird places to get no drop stuff. It took me 2 years to do this quest. I did some of the parts before it was made even more difficult. The part of finding the lost dwarf in Kael... That is a tough one.<br/>
It is a pretty good item though and I still wear it on my lvl 66 cleric.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt;takes some time to complete and has the effect of &quot;Zephyr of Brell&quot; <br/>
&gt;which is 30 extension on your beneficial spells, as a bonus it also <br/>
&gt;has FT 3 as well.  If you plan on getting your trade skills up then it <br/>
&gt;would be a great piece of gear to get as it is a shoulder item, <br/>
&gt;shoulders are the hardest piece of gear to upgrade. <br/>
