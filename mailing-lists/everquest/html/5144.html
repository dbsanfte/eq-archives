<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272781535">I am wondering: does every player hear the voice, or is it supposed <br/>
to be geared toward level 20+ players? I hear the voice with both my <br/>
level 10 halfling cleric and my level 8 barbarian warrior...<br/>

&gt; You have to go to the city you started in and you should hear a <br/>
&gt; second voice.  If you&#39;ve managed to piss them off you can got to WK <br/>
&gt; near the undead camp or Rathe Mtns at the Gypses.  They will tell <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; who to talk to and what to say.  Then find the Wayfarer camp you <br/>
were <br/>
&gt; directed to and your in!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck.  My low level alt have no trouble in LDoN.  Of course <br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m hoping someone can remind me about this... I got the LDoN <br/>
&gt; message about <br/>
&gt; &gt; who to speak to for the adventure stone when I was level 16, and <br/>
&gt; since I wasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; at 20 yet, I didn&#39;t do it. Now that I&#39;m at 22, I can&#39;t remember <br/>
who <br/>
&gt; it was I <br/>
&gt; &gt; was supposed to talk to. Who is the person in Halas that gives <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; the stone?<br/>
