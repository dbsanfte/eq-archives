<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265993498">To everyone worried about money at low lvls, why? If it was me I would just<br/>
try to lvl instead of trying to make money.  Money will come.  Once you get<br/>
to your mid 20&#39;s to late 20&#39;s almost everything drops FS weapons and up to 4<br/>
or 5plat in money as well.  Although I do remember the days when you could<br/>
kill dwarf NPC in BBM and get an axe that sold for 22p Xg everytime you<br/>
killed them.  3 spawns every 12  minutes. 1 person could make over 300pp<br/>
every hour.  Not too bad.  They are lvl 35 btw but no longer drop the good<br/>
axes.  <br/>
<br/>
Another great place for money and EXP is Neriak (sp?).  If your around lvl<br/>
40 or so and can get a group together you wont be disapointed (at 40 you<br/>
would need a pretty well rounded group at 50 or so , btw still get exp here<br/>
at 54 all the guards are still blue, you could do it with 3 or 4 people.  Go<br/>
in the city and head to 3rd gate zone but dont zone in.  Fight at the zone<br/>
in and pull from Neriak Commons.  18 spaws here that we could kill in 24<br/>
minutes.  All of them dropped a sword that our enchanter could sell for 11p<br/>
and some change, also dropped a shield and usually a second FS weapon.  Have<br/>
fun know this is a little off the lvl range for what you guys were talking<br/>
about but might help someone.<br/>

<br/>
heh...we all have our choices...<br/>
<br/>
GO TO FREEPORT...heh...join an orc group from 9-12...<br/>
when you make 12 or 13...goto North Ro (through the tunnel)<br/>
and join a Dervish group until level 15 (don&#39;t join the group that actually<br/>
spawns Derv)<br/>
at 15 goto (yes the goto command is a habit from qbasic) Oasis and join a<br/>
group there (since I&#39;m not 15 yet...I can&#39;t tell you what to fight....but<br/>
this is the current future when I return to virginia<br/>
<br/>
when you are in the derv groups...do an honor loot system (or the random<br/>
system) to see who gets the bronze armor...<br/>
good money...when backpacks are full or I take an hour to walk a single<br/>
step....I go to the nearest merchant and sell...<br/>
...generally say 20-35pp an hour...<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a level 9 Ranger (almost 10), and when I get to lvl 20, looking<br/>
&gt; forward to a nice wedding. I&#39;m looking to take my time leveling, so I can<br/>
&gt; make some good money for a ring, presents, food, etc. Where&#39;s the best<br/>
&gt; money to be had?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
