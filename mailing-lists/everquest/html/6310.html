<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489333765">Make sure any ports that need to be mapped on your router are mapped, and if<br/>
you have a firewall now that you didn&#39;t have before, that it&#39;s set to allow<br/>
what EQ requests.<br/>
<br/>
We had a problem with being able to connect after our ISP finally realized<br/>
we were using an outdated &quot;DSL manager&quot; program they&#39;d supplied several<br/>
years ago and for an older, identical appearing modem and when we replaced<br/>
it last year after it went tits up unexpectedly, we continued with the same<br/>
until out of the blue, it stopped working. A few very puzzled calls later,<br/>
we had it changed to treating the modem as if it were any normal router, but<br/>
still not working right with EQ. Spent some more time with tech support and<br/>
we find out not only is our little modem a router in disguise, it&#39;s a<br/>
hardware firewall also...and that aspect of it was turned on with the same<br/>
changes we had to make to connect. We had to turn the firewall feature off<br/>
to be able to connect to EQ, most IRC servers, and pretty much anything<br/>
beyond basic email and web browsing. If you&#39;ve made any recent changes to<br/>
your configuration, even just a router firmware update, please look into<br/>
that as a possible cause.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you do find it&#39;s something like that, make sure you have a good<br/>
software firewall to take up the slack. I like Tiny Personal<br/>
Firewall....very easy to configure and lives up to its name on resources.<br/>
Sygate Firewall did it&#39;s basic job extremely well before that, and was also<br/>
extremely easy to configure, but over time got to be wickedly unstable and<br/>
then finally refused to play nicely with the second NIC, so it had to go.<br/>

&gt; I can&#39;t even get into the normal game. I keep trying and all I get is 1017<br/>
all the time. I may have to cancel my accounts if this keeps up. No point in<br/>
paying for a game I can&#39;t play.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Well I&#39;d love to tell ya if I could ever get into the damn thing!  It&#39;s<br/>
till not working for me!<br/>
&gt; &gt;  From the small bit I did see, they&#39;ve added 2 new tabs to the Inventory<br/>
window.  One says Evolving Weapons, and the other one says Monster Alts.<br/>
The latest patch message I saw said that the monster alts was not working<br/>
yet.  And some NPCs whose character models are not in zone yet are replaced<br/>
by the standard human model.  They call this model &quot;Doug&quot;.<br/>
