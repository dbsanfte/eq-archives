<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129481374">Yeah. I didn&#39;t think a picture mattered. I get the messages through email too. I only go to the site if I have to do some moderating, although I usually am too slow to beat my co-mod to it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Since I receive posts via email, I don&#39;t normally tend to go to the website much.  So a picture wouldn&#39;t make much difference to me.  However, why not just take a stock logo of EverQuest, run it through Photoshop and add &quot;@yahoogroups.com&quot; to it?  It&#39;s not like there&#39;s one particular picture that&#39;s going to summarize the essence of what this group is all about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But it&#39;s &quot;ur list&quot; so do what you want with the picture!<br/>

Before I turned posting pictures off there were some spammers uploading things that had nothing to do with EverQuest so I had to turn it off to prevent it. They were doing that for file uploading as well so I had to disable that.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;Otherwise we&#39;d be getting graphics of ads for lousy porn and probably those annoying ones about Islam. Possibly those scams from Nigeria as well.<br/>
