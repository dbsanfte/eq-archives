<b>Subject:</b> Ogre faction and training near freeport? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278246056">Hi all,<br/>
 <br/>
  I just got a friend into EQ (Is it just me or does anyone else seem to <br/>
picture that Truth tobacco commercial ads with body bags whenever you <br/>
introduce a new victu...er, player to EQ? &gt;:-) ).  She&#39;s decided to start<br/>
an Ogre warrioress with green hair (She liked the green hair for some reason),<br/>
and I brought her all the way to freeport.  <br/>
 <br/>
  Since i&#39;ve never played an evil factioned race before, i have no idea where<br/>
she should go to train her skills.  We found she can get into Neriak to buy/sell<br/>
and bank, but the warriors guild there won&#39;t train her.  We also tried that   <br/>
barbarian warrior under east freeport.  <br/>
 <br/>
  Does any know where she can train near Neriak or freeport? Or does she have<br/>
to travel all the way back to Ogguk?  Also any tips on what she can do to help<br/>
her faction so she can get into the freeport city would be appreciated! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
