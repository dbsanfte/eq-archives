<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375892991">Another place that I&#39;ve used frequently to xp up at that level is<br/>
Marus Seru, at the Sanctus Seru entrance.  At 25, Greyhoppers would be<br/>
the best bet since the Stonegrabbers are pretty tough at that level,<br/>
but I took my ranger from 24 to 33 at that spot.  Again, no real loot<br/>
to speak of, but quiet, easy xp.</div>
