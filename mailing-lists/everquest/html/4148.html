<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809109245">I heard that maybe one of these DOES matter the order<br/>
in which she is given things.<br/>
<br/>
I will check a couple of resources to see if that is<br/>
true and if there is any mention of the order.<br/>
<br/>
It will help me too since I have a 32 level Human<br/>
mage.<br/>
<br/>
Will let you know<br/>

&gt; received my Stein of Ulissa. However, when I tried<br/>
&gt; to turn in the items for <br/>
&gt; my Broom of Trillion, Vira told me that Solusek Ro<br/>
&gt; did not accept half <br/>
&gt; measures, kept my items, and did not give me the<br/>
&gt; focus item.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She evidently felt that I had somehow failed to<br/>
&gt; properly fulfill the quest, <br/>
&gt; yet I am certain I gave her all the correct items.<br/>
&gt; When offering her an item, <br/>
&gt; the 4-slot trade-box opens with that item in the<br/>
&gt; first slot. Does it matter <br/>
&gt; what order the items are placed in the slots? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other thing I wonder about is that after I<br/>
&gt; turned in my items and received  <br/>
&gt; the stein, I talked to her about all of the other<br/>
&gt; focus quests. I do not <br/>
&gt; remember what order we discussed them, but could she<br/>
&gt; only be remembering the <br/>
&gt; last one we discussed and it was not for the broom?<br/>
