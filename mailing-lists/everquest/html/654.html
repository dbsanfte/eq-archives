<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138306196">It&#39;s tough being RED on Blue servers.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that a new GM/Char has been making <br/>
rounds to convert the fallen back to Protected<br/>
status.  For some reason, I keep missing him.<br/>
<br/>
I asked a guide, er /Petitioned, and was told<br/>
that a Schedule was posted on the Everquest site.<br/>
I clicked about, but didn&#39;t see one.  <br/>
I was told to ALSO check the EQVault for postings.  None easily visible there.<br/>
<br/>
So.. Those of you here in the &quot;know&quot;, any guesses?<br/>
