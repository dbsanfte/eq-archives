  Everquest question, please help</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>&gt;Hi all,<br>&gt;Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie 
  had a 4th level Druid in the city of<br>Elves and while out at the Orc 
  &gt;Camp, with others, I got killed by an Orc<br>Centurian and when I returned 
  to get my corpse, nothing was &gt;there.&nbsp; It was<br>not more than 4 
  minutes when I returned.<br>&gt;<br>No problem. All of us were newbies 
  once.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my 
  corpse? The book<br>says no but I beg to differ.<br>&gt;Is it possible that I 
  had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I went back<br>with a dead body I 
  died again?&nbsp; &gt;Which meant I found the wrong corpse?<br>&gt;<br>You 
  must have found the second corpse. It can be tough sometimes getting 
  the<br>right corpse if you die more than once. And sometimes if you don&#39;t have 
  any<br>items other than foraged food, you lose the foraged stuff anyways and 
  just<br>get back the food you started with. Up to level 5 I think you get 
  your<br>food/drink and tome of discord back. I think your starting weapon 
  too.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as 
  I have no food,<br>no money, no nothing?&quot;&nbsp; Do I &gt;beg or do I start 
  another char?<br>&gt;This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to 
  learn which way to<br>go all the time and dying, it is starting &gt;to get to 
  me,<br>&gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since 
  the Chat<br>from the game options was &gt;USELESS.<br>&gt;<br>Well, if it bugs 
  you that much, you can start over again. But even if you<br>lose everything, 
  at that low level you can just keep the character and just<br>build your items 
  and such back up again. I recommend that you not carry<br>anything you really 
  don&#39;t want to lose until you get level 6. Keep<br>everything else in the bank. 
  Especially your money. Oh, and practice<br>foraging alot. It will help you 
  later on in the game. Trust me. Begging is<br>not a good idea. Begging tend to 
  piss people off. And you might want to<br>avoid orc camps at that level. at 
  least stay close to the lift with a good<br>group and have someone to pull 
  wandering orc cents. I think even some orc<br>pawns might give you xp at that 
  level.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Please help and Thanks in 
  advance<br>&gt;Rob<br>&gt;<br>You&#39;re welcome.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
