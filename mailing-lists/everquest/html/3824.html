<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413292156">-  Cleric CH will only heal up to 7,500 HP, instead of <br/>
the 10,000 previously<br/>
<br/>
Only affect it could have is making raids even more dependant on clerics,<br/>
less healing=more clerics. VI said this will open up for new healing spells<br/>
tho, to soon to say what impact it will have. As for today, no impact at<br/>
all. Getting 7.5k hps ain&#39;t that common =P<br/>
<br/>
-  Monks won&#39;t avoid damage as easily as previously<br/>
<br/>
Could see it comming. Monks were to good.<br/>
<br/>
-  Manaburn will only work once per minute on a mob<br/>
<br/>
Will remove mb groups, big deal.<br/>
<br/>
-  A bunch of Mod Rod changes.<br/>
<br/>
To early to say, VI said they will tweak &quot;uber mobs&quot; to avoid 20 minute<br/>
fights but who knows. Differens from today will be that mages won&#39;t be doing<br/>
mod rod carpets.<br/>
