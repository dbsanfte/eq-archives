<b>Subject:</b> A thought or 4 on EQ..if anyone cares <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-960204033">I have been playing EQ for many years now, including the year I have <br/>
taken off. I love the game, it is my &quot;break&quot; from the<br/>
real-world, as <br/>
I am sure it is for many others.  I have been a loyal fan <br/>
and &quot;faithful&quot; to it, like a marriage of sorts. I cannot<br/>
imagine the<br/>
world <br/>
without EQ, well at least my world. Even in the past year without <br/>
it, I have spent countless hours perusing the EQ sites, reading and <br/>
posting in this forum, and chatting with others who still play.<br/>
<br/>
My mind is relatively fresh to the game, though when I return I <br/>
still will feel like a newb again (and to many I am sure it will <br/>
seem like my toons are &quot;E-BAYED&quot;).  But that doesn&#39;t<br/>
bother me so <br/>
much, I am informed and a very quick learner, mostly because EQ is <br/>
in fact so easy to learn and easyperiod.<br/>
<br/>
There is speculation that EQ will end in a few years. Personally, <br/>
whenever it does shutdown, I think it will be painfully bad, much <br/>
like a death in the family. However, I don&#39;t think EQ will close <br/>
anytime soon.  I agree that SOE will not give up their main cash <br/>
cow, that would be like cutting off your nose in spite of your face. <br/>
Even with the amount of subscribers being down, I don&#39;t think it<br/>
is <br/>
yet low enough for them to worry or discuss bailing on the project.<br/>
<br/>
But, let me say this: I WILL BE THE LAST &quot;MAN&quot; STANDING ON<br/>
NORRATH <br/>
WHEN IT ENDS. If the decision ever comes to end EQ, I will be there <br/>
when they pull that ugly,white, 8-foot extension cord from the wall.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure I am not the first person to say that EQ has its problems, <br/>
and that SOE should fix these problems. I don&#39;t think they will<br/>
fix <br/>
all of them, but they fix problems all the time ( just not the ones <br/>
we always want..lol) There are many &quot;improvements&quot; that they<br/>
could <br/>
make to make the gamebetter, like improving the graphics engine. <br/>
But if not, the one that exists is good enough, afterall it is the <br/>
one that I started with and come to love<br/>
<br/>
There are some who say that the in-game content is limited. I am not <br/>
clear exactly what  that means, but for the sake of this scribing, I <br/>
will deem it means &quot;the stuff in game..the lore, the legend, the <br/>
mobs, etc&quot;those things that you deal with everyday. I have<br/>
played <br/>
EQ for a few years, and as such, there is still a whole s@*tload of <br/>
things that I have not seen or places I have been or things I <br/>
haven&#39;t killed. I have 16 toons to play with, my highest being a<br/>
57 <br/>
wizard. ( LOL I think he was 57 for a year before I took my <br/>
break..lol)<br/>
<br/>
If you take away the last 2 expansions (which I do not have) and <br/>
perhaps even &quot;GoD&quot;, there is still a lot of things to do in<br/>
EQmuch <br/>
too many to do in any good amount of time. I have always been the <br/>
fan of the idea of SOE going back and slowly &quot;fixing&quot; the<br/>
stuff that <br/>
was originally thereand making it better..making some of these <br/>
things that I haven&#39;t done, more desirable to do.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that SOE needs to make new expansions and deliver new <br/>
content. However, I think that the rate they have been pushing them <br/>
out as of late, is a bit ridiculous if you ask me. It seems they put <br/>
them out faster than I can get them, lol. As a business decision, <br/>
perhaps its good they put out &quot;new&quot; stuff and the thinking <br/>
that &quot;new&quot; is better and will bring back people to the game.<br/>
While <br/>
true it may be, I feel that &quot;tuning-up&quot; what already exists<br/>
is the <br/>
far wiser option. But I am not SOE, I am just me.<br/>
<br/>
As far as other games, as far as I am concerned, there ARE no other <br/>
games. I have my blinders in place. I do not have the &quot;mental <br/>
prowess&quot; or &quot;attention-span&quot; to play another game. I<br/>
would feel like <br/>
it was cheating on my wife. As I said, there are so many things I <br/>
have not done that I want to, I would feel like I left something <br/>
unfinished..and I hate that feeling.<br/>
<br/>
In my EQ Journal ( I have one, doesn&#39;t everyone?) I have a very <br/>
comprehensive list of the things I am going to do when I return, and <br/>
the list grows longer every day or so. This list is what I will be <br/>
doing when I returnat last count..I have 150 must do&#39;s on<br/>
the list<br/>
So I will be busyBut enough on that.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, to make the long story short.EQ will be around for a long<br/>
time<br/>
( /em crosses fingers) and there I will stay. It is like that little <br/>
vacation spot that  I have been going to and loved forever. <br/>
<br/>
EQ FOREVEREQ FOREVER..EQ FOREVEREQ FOREVER<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this was so long..<br/>
<br/>
As always..Greg</div>
