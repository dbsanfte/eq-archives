<div>put at least 1 point into your combat skills, swimming is also a good one as some of the zones you&#39;re going to end up in are water zones, put 1 in fletching as well so you can make arrows, train in all of your combat 1hs,2hs,1hb,2hb,piercing,h2h, all of them. As a meat shield you&#39;re eventually going to need all of them max or as close to max as you can get them. Once you have&nbsp;1 point in them then the rest will come as you use the weapon of that type, and yea a warrior who can&#39;t dodge out of the way of a blow is seriously going to take some damage and need a cleric just for their own use. Bash could stop a caster mob from casting so you need that, taunt is essential to get the agro off a caster (especially my enchanter when she tashes and nukes). When i have a mob mezzed and you go to wake it up&nbsp;I want you to taunt it and get it mad at you rather then running over and beating on me&nbsp;if you can&#39;t then please pay for my rez :)&nbsp; at level 9 you&#39;re not going to have come across too many mobs that cast spells on you but trust me they get worse as your levels go up.</div>

<div>Blacksmithing will get you some plat back eventually and you&#39;ll be able to improve your armor at little cost as well. Try making some of the things that are in demand like the baking items, dairy spoons, pie tins, skillet, knives, muffin pans, these you can sell in bazaar, the spoon and pie tin and skillet i paid 25pp for each on our server so&nbsp;you&#39;ll be making a good profit. I&#39;ll look for my link for recipies and send it in another email for you to check out, you&nbsp;may want to take up tailoring as well as i believe some of the armor you&#39;ll&nbsp;need padding and that&#39;s a tailoring skill, plus there&#39;s other&nbsp;items you can sell and it&#39;ll give you something to do with the&nbsp;skins and spider silks you&#39;ll get when hunting&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div><tt>Hi all, I&#39;m new to the group and new to EQ.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been playing maybe<br>three days.<br><br>I am now a level 9 barbarian warrior.&nbsp; So far I&#39;ve been putting all my<br>points into 1h slashing.&nbsp; I have six points that I have no clue where<br>to put.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Bash, taunt? Dodge? I&#39;m leaning towards<br>those, but I want to focus my efforts so that I get the most results<br>from my points so I can really use some advice.<br><br>Oh, for some strange reason i&#39;ve been developing blacksmithing.&nbsp; I&#39;ve<br>got near 30 points in that.&nbsp; It&#39;s fun, but seriously...will anything<br>fruitful ever come of this trade skill?<br><br>Thanks in advance.<br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br>
