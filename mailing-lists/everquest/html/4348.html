on Fehril to pull up a training screen that I didn&#39;t even know to <br/>
look for. I&#39;ll be right clicking on npcs now. I&#39;ve upped my single <br/>
and and double hand blunt weapon skills. I was trying to drop my <br/>
club into a hand slot instead of an equiped weapon slot. Thanks to <br/>
everyone for their help. I&#39;m heading back to the crater now. I have <br/>
some revenge to catch up on. Rock hoppers and skeletons prepare to <br/>
meet your doom! I&#39;m kind of getting into this. G<br/>
