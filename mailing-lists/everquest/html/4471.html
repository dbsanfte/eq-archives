<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-640617101"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So how does one get from level 30 to level 50 in the shortest amount<br/>
&gt; [...]<br/>
&gt; I hate for my rogue to fall by the way side because he&#39;s become a bore<br/>
&gt; to play.  So any suggestions you have for playing rogue characters to<br/>
&gt; help me out would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1st of all, i think 30 to 35 are the worst levels for all classes.<br/>
<br/>
well, let&#39;s try to find you some help. did you have a look at<br/>
	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thesafehouse.org/">http://www.thesafehouse.org/</a><br/>
IMHO this is the site for EQ rogues, even if i don&#39;t know this site, but<br/>
many rouges i met always referred to it.<br/>
<br/>
i would also have a look at allakhazam and eq-atlas to find zones for<br/>
certain level ranges and then just have a look at them.<br/>
<br/>
another thing is: if you currently don&#39;t like to play (a certain char),<br/>
just don&#39;t do it. try something else, but just don&#39;t suffer a burnout!<br/>
it is a game and we pay for it to have fun, not to get annoyed...<br/>
<br/>
i am playing EQ for four years now and from time to time i need some<br/>
distance aka vacation from EQ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
have fun<br/>
