<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I find it would be very hard to determine the 
&quot;ideal&quot; candidate becuase everyone has their own story.&nbsp; Some are unique, 
some are not.&nbsp; Me, for example, I&#39;ve been on EverQuest over 2 years and I 
also have two accounts.&nbsp; The difference is that I started EverQuest BECAUSE 
of my job.&nbsp; Most of the people I worked with also played EverQuest and it&#39;s 
all they ever talked about.&nbsp; I began playing EQ at a time in my life when 
my job was all I had.&nbsp; No social life, no nothing.&nbsp; Just Work and 
EQ.&nbsp; I slept very little and played up to 16 hours a day.&nbsp; Needless to 
say, I becamse very burned out, and I quit my job.&nbsp; I moved and got a new 
job and put myself in a position where I had a nice balance between EQ, social 
life, and work.&nbsp; I would have considered myself an addict.&nbsp; EQ was all 
I thought about.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t wait to get home from work so I could 
play.&nbsp; But now, I&#39;ve been able to refocus my attention on other 
things.&nbsp; Now I go to school full time, work part time, and play EQ when I 
have no other social plans.&nbsp; Even though I still play, it&#39;s no longer the 
first thing I think of when I&#39;m bored and need something to do.&nbsp; I still 
love the game and I have no intentions of quitting.&nbsp; Especially now that 
after 2 years my main character is JUST NOW hitting level 50 and going to start 
working on his epic and AA points.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It&#39;s always interesting and entertaining for me to 
hear other people&#39;s stories.&nbsp; Although I wouldn&#39;t mind appearing on the 
VH-1 show, I wouldn&#39;t consider myself the &quot;ideal&quot; candidate since my addiction 
days are over and I&#39;ve found a comfortable niche, but I think whoever does get 
on the show is gonna have a great time.&nbsp; I know I did when I went to San 
Francisco for the episode of Call For Help on Tech TV.&nbsp; Good luck to anyone 
who&#39;s interested, and congrats to whomever they choose - even if it&#39;s me.&nbsp; 
:) hehehe!</font></div>

  Everyone,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks for taking the time to read this post. 
  I&#39;m<br>&gt; working on a new <br>&gt; show for VH1 entitled &quot;My Obsession&quot; It 
  focuses on<br>&gt; pop-culture and <br>&gt; it&#39;s effects on society, people, 
  etc.&nbsp; We are<br>&gt; working on a segment <br>&gt; that highlights people 
  submerged in the world of<br>&gt; Everquest, and I&#39;m <br>&gt; looking for 
  possible candidates for the show.&nbsp; Our<br>&gt; ideal person would 
  <br>&gt; be someone who plays the game<br>&gt; continuously/excessively and 
  has <br>&gt; encountered problems be it family or friends due to<br>&gt; their 
  EQ habits.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Side note: This is not meant to be an 
  Everquest<br>&gt; &quot;bashing&quot;<br>&gt; story as so many from the past have 
  been.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Reg<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;
