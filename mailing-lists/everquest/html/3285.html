<div id="ygrps-yiv-543353350">Ive got a question for the list. <br/>
<br/>
Its around the account is personal and cant be exchanged with outhers bla<br/>
bla. I do agree very much that you shall keep your account safe and all<br/>
this, but in a large scale operations guild its IMPOSSIBLE to not share your<br/>
account with a few people that you trust. This is essential to day to day<br/>
operations. You choose a couple of people who you trust and hand them your<br/>
info.<br/>
<br/>
1 example. Guild property and funding. A single person cannot manage the<br/>
trades/funds/hand out of items for the guild. This would be a full time job<br/>
for 1 person in my guild. Our solution is a separate account shared among<br/>
the officers with mules for cash / gems / spells / items. On our<br/>
messageboard transactions take place and a member can ask any officer to<br/>
complete a transaction once its validated on board. This is clearly against<br/>
the EULA but since there are no support for these types of operations with a<br/>
central store for a guild we have not found a better way to handle work like<br/>
this. How do others solve these types of problems?<br/>

Well, any exchange of accounts is forbidden by the terms of service. Part of<br/>
the reason for this is that the person buying the account may get swindled.<br/>
They may pay for the account only to find that the character is deleted or<br/>
the person changes passwords on them and so forth. I&#39;ve heard of this<br/>
happening. Or they may get an account that has many soulmarks for bad<br/>
behavior. Also, people who work for Verant and EQ have been invited to this<br/>
list. If they see the people advertising they are selling their accounts<br/>
here, they may bust the person who is trying to sell it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>that against the rules? I thought it was just if it was for $$$?<br/>

&gt; I would like to remind people that anything that violates the terms of<br/>
&gt; service of EQ is not allowed on this mailing list. If you are trying to<br/>
&gt; sell<br/>
&gt; your account, please do not do it here.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If anyone wants this account, I am done with it. Time to try<br/>
&gt; &gt; something new. All expansions enabled.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Will take account trade, platnum, or items. Send email to<br/>
