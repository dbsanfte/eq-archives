<div id="ygrps-yiv-20789393"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Ok I had never thought about getting my account &quot;hacked&quot; into. &nbsp;I would have 
<br>thought that as long as I didn&#39;t give out my information that I would be 
<br>safe. &nbsp;I have friends who are aware of the name yes but have no clue about 
<br>the password. &nbsp;And as their accounts are worth far more than mine I don&#39;t see 
<br>that they would try to figure out the password, plus, I don&#39;t see them as the 
<br>kind who could figure out how to hack into my computer. &nbsp;But if for some 
<br>reason we were hacked into....and I lost all my stuff and character...I would 
<br>cancel my subscription and sell my game. &nbsp;No way would I tolerate losing that 
<br>and keep paying. &nbsp;But I&#39;m guessing this isn&#39;t a every day thing right? &nbsp;I 
<br>mean it makes me think of AOL and how they are constantly saying don&#39;t give 
<br>out your password. &nbsp;
