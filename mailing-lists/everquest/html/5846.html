<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017529602">Thanks for the link. Unfortunately there isn&#39;t much my ISP can do for me because of my phonelines sucking so bad. The dialup ISP I have is nice (I use it as backup when satellite goes down-- but it is extremely slow) but they can&#39;t do anything about the phone company. Bell South just sucks.<br/>
I do have friends who are looking for dialup ISPs so I can probably refer them to that site.<br/>

Wow! I don&#39;t know if this site will help you. I&#39;ve used it in the <br/>
past and recommend it to anyone looking for an ISP.<br/>

&gt; I can&#39;t get ISDN.<br/>
&gt; I also can&#39;t get snail mail delivery, trash pickup, pizza <br/>
delivery, full phonelines, or paved roads. I&#39;m 10 miles out from <br/>
town in the middle of the woods.<br/>
&gt; Before satellite I had dialup that only had 19.2k bandwidth <br/>
because my phonelines suck and the phone company refused to fix <br/>
them. They are the only phone company available to me in my <br/>
particular area. In the city they have full phonelines going to each <br/>
house, but out here they decided to be cheap and split up a line <br/>
that should go to one house to serve several houses. The box the <br/>
lines are in got knocked over and the lines have probably been <br/>
damaged. Whenever it rains my lines get even worse, but the phone <br/>
company denies there is a problem and won&#39;t send anyone out to look. <br/>
The last time I dialed up when I lost connection from satellite <br/>
during a thunderstorm I used dialup but only connected at 6k. So my <br/>
phonelines now provide less bandwidth than legally required.<br/>
&gt; So satellite was the lesser of the 2 evils. I do get some latency, <br/>
but I can download about 800k.<br/>
