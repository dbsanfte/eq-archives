<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-287699938">I know this may seem like a rather stupid question, but please humor <br/>
me.  I only have the PoP expansion, I play on the Mael.. Star.. <br/>
(something like that) server.  Where is/How do you get to the Bazzar <br/>
that I have heard so much about.<br/>
Thank you in advance for your time.</div>
