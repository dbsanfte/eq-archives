<b>Subject:</b> mana boost vs int/wis boost <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-817518656"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; mana boosts are better at lower levels than stat<br/>
&gt; boosts which are better at higher levels. In the<br/>
&gt; past you maxed your Wis at 200 then got mana<br/>
&gt; boosting items. Now I think it maxes at 250. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Close. The WIS maximum has always been 255, but before<br/>
Luclin WIS above 200 only gave one point of mana per<br/>
point of WIS. They loosened the soft cap around the<br/>
release of Luclin, so now each point of WIS above 200<br/>
gives around 5-6 mana. In my experience (44 Druid is<br/>
my main) the best bet is to get WIS up to the 200 cap<br/>
then start shopping for resist and mana items. There&#39;s<br/>
quite a few very inexpensive items with major WIS<br/>
boosts available.<br/>
<br/>
To the other guy, at 33 you&#39;re high enough to be<br/>
leveling in Velious, i&#39;d recommend heading over there<br/>
ASAP. I started by root and rotting Snow Cougars in<br/>
Iceclad til 34, then quad kiting them til 38. (I<br/>
believe it was 38 that they started conning light<br/>
blue, might have been 37) From there you can do<br/>
Drakkel Dire Wolves in GD for faction or quad Ulthorks<br/>
in EW for amazing loot and good xp.<br/>
<br/>
The side perk of hunting in Velious is that&#39;s where<br/>
the higher levels tend to congregate these days. Drop<br/>
your bind at the bank in Thurg and keep an eye out for<br/>
those 100pp port requests. *grin*<br/>
