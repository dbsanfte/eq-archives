<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750090564">There&#39;s also the fact that people tend to be nicer to female characters and<br/>
give them more stuff. However, male characters get listened to more often.<br/>
If a female character is giving instructions people tend to either ignore<br/>
her or call her bitchy, but if a male character is giving instructions,<br/>
people are more likely to listen. Of course some people don&#39;t listen to<br/>
either gender. Well, I&#39;ve noticed that they are more likely to listen to a<br/>
female now than they were a few years ago. Guys get more buddy-buddy with a<br/>
male character. I like playing a male character bc I get treated like one of<br/>
the guys. People joke with me and don&#39;t feel uncomfortable about saying<br/>
things that they wouldn&#39;t say if they knew I was female. Also, females are<br/>
more likely to be flirted with and asked their bra size. So annoying.<br/>

    Well this is an opinion mind you, I think most guys like to play females<br/>
because of the way they look.  I have played females as well as males and I<br/>
am a guy.  A friend of mine when he played only played female characters,<br/>
when I asked him about it he said he liked the way they looked.  Well that&#39;s<br/>
my two coppers.</div>
