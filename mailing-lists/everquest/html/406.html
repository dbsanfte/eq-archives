<div id="ygrps-yiv-894083849"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; but I can give advice easily enough.  When you reach level 8 or <br/>
&gt; so and you <br/>
&gt; start adventuring into the commons, don&#39;t go near any human npc&#39;s <br/>
&gt; - they&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; attack you on sight.  That&#39;s the biggest disadvantage to being a <br/>
&gt; dark elf - <br/>
&gt; nobody likes you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well the guards won&#39;t attack you although the innkeepers<br/>
will. The guards in freeport also leave you alone, although<br/>
some shopkeepers don&#39;t.<br/>

As far as I am concerned though, Nektulos forest sucks for<br/>
low-mid levels, it has decent experience, can be quite rough<br/>
at times but has *awful* money. Most necros would be much<br/>
better off migrating and getting bound to grobb asap - the<br/>
innothule swamp is one of the best newbie areas in the game.</div>
