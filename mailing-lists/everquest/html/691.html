<b>Subject:</b> Hey guys, any info on a this faction..... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-261453500">I am interested in getting this Man O&#39;war , and i heard it has to do from a <br/>
quest from the Dwarven Paladin guild, so i went there and i hailed each and <br/>
every one of them, but my faction is too sucky to get a decent response from <br/>
them other than, &quot;Half elves like you are a disgrace to Norrath&quot; .. and <br/>
other things like that<br/>
<br/>
so my question is, anybody know a way to get faction with these buggers, i <br/>
cant do one of their quests, because i cant get a quest out of them, any <br/>
monsters i can kill? or quests from any other kaladim guilds that will give <br/>
me some faction to Clerics of Underfoot?<br/>
<br/>
any info qould be appreciated, thx!<br/>
