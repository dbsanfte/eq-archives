<div id="ygrps-yiv-551301417">In my opinion, I know what opinions are like, if you wait for your second<br/>
half you are going to be a bit disappointed. A lot of stuff will start to<br/>
turn green.  Lvl 14 is perfect time to do this zone.  You just got that<br/>
great VS Summoned spell (low mana high dmg) and this zone is FULL of<br/>
summoned mobs.  Just remember if you are the meleeing type dont forget to<br/>
dispel the Lava Elementals and Imps they have a nasty fire shield.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, and good luck.<br/>

PS Honestly the water is a moot point, its not a big deal at all.  If your<br/>
invis drops on the bridge you could have some trouble. <br/>

I haven&#39;t made that run yet. I plan to sow and camo, then run the <br/>
road. Since the bridge is the safest way to cross the water, I will <br/>
use that. Alternately, sow, levitate, then camo. Might be able to lev <br/>
over the water along the left wall.<br/>
<br/>
I figured it must be a not particularly safe place when I found <br/>
groups resting just outside the zone. They seemed to be hunting just <br/>
inside, then zoning to med and rest.<br/>
<br/>
Per advice here, I am thinking on working on Lavastorm for some <br/>
leveling in the second half of my teens.<br/>
