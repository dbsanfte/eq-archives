<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-300745922">Ahh seeing your question makes me happy, let me<br/>
explain.<br/>
<br/>
I posed a question about a guild earlier in the week<br/>
and you remark about taking someone that low seems to<br/>
boost my confidence in the guild I just started.<br/>
<br/>
My highest char is 20 and I started a guild for which<br/>
I will recruit First Timer and non twinks under the<br/>
level of 10.  Reason I figure is newbs always have<br/>
questions, looking for players/friends, what have you<br/>
and most guilds want High level chars.<br/>
<br/>
I formed my Guild to bring newbs into the game to meet<br/>
people and grow their chars together.  This way<br/>
everyone will know the trubulations of making a char<br/>
and the time that goes into it.<br/>
<br/>
I had my doubts but with you question, I think it will<br/>
have a good response.<br/>
<br/>
it just got approved and created last night, tonight<br/>
is recruit night....lol<br/>
<br/>
Well, this just me ranting, hopefully the guild<br/>
succeeds.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.....<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve been reading the posts for a while and<br/>
&gt; thought I&#39;d say hello. I <br/>
&gt;   play on the Tholuxe Paells server. My main is a 44<br/>
&gt; druid and I&#39;ve got <br/>
&gt;   quite a few little alts too. If anyone is on TP,<br/>
&gt; look me up. :)<br/>
