<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624054464">Well, GMs said that the official rule is whoever engaged the mob first gets<br/>
the kill. I talked to Guide Llamar and he said that there is a general play<br/>
nice rule that if someone is taking two camps they should share. That if<br/>
someone else wants to hunt at one of those camps, for every mob the guy<br/>
pulls from your camp you get to pull one from their camp. But that can&#39;t<br/>
really be enforced. Camps are not actually upheld. By play nice rules it is<br/>
considered rude to take more than one camp if there are not enough camps to<br/>
share with others. so it&#39;s ok to claim several camps if nobody else wants<br/>
them, but if other people want to move in, best thing you can do is pick one<br/>
and stay there. If the person tries to pull mobs that you have already<br/>
engaged then it is considered KSing on his part or attempted ksing.<br/>
Furthermore there are rules against farming. The everquest official page<br/>
doesn&#39;t give details but I think if someone is hogging spawns by pulling<br/>
mass amounts and not letting other people kill then it is considered<br/>
farming. I will have to ask a GM about the specifics.<br/>
I suppose I should state my point, someone can&#39;t really claim more than one<br/>
camp if someone else wants the camp and can get the spawns before the<br/>
multi-camper does. It&#39;s generally polite to ask if you can move in on a<br/>
camp. If the person is rude about it just move in anyways.<br/>
