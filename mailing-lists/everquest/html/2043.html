<div id="ygrps-yiv-496512562">LOL! Sounds like fun. Sorry I missed that.<br/>
What did you say to the faeries for them to give you gifts and stuff?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Did anyone else happen to catch this? I was in GFay<br/>
&gt; with my halfling druid memming spells when suddenly<br/>
&gt; there was a zone wide message of &quot;You hear faeries<br/>
&gt; giggling&quot;, then a handful of faeries started to talk<br/>
&gt; about wanting to play hide and go seek. After doing a<br/>
&gt; quick &quot;/who&quot; on one and getting &quot;there are no players<br/>
&gt; in this zone under this name&quot; I lept up and started<br/>
&gt; running madly around Kelethin trying to find them. A<br/>
&gt; few other players caught on rather quickly and started<br/>
&gt; a zone wide game of hide and seek. :) I found a couple<br/>
&gt; of them on the ground after a while and since I was<br/>
&gt; playing a halfling didn&#39;t mind getting into the whole<br/>
&gt; thing. (&quot;hee hee! I&#39;ve found you, now it&#39;s off to find<br/>
&gt; the others!&quot; ;) Eventually things culminated just<br/>
&gt; outside of Felwithe where about 25 or so players<br/>
&gt; gathered around the faeries. Unfortunately a couple of<br/>
&gt; blithering morons decided it was a good idea to attack<br/>
&gt; and managed to deal on average 2-3 points of dmg (one<br/>
&gt; per swing, zero per spell) and get laughed at. The<br/>
&gt; faeries handed out gifts to a couple of people, one<br/>
&gt; got a Mithiril Breastplate, don&#39;t know about anything<br/>
&gt; else. (I didn&#39;t get anything) Then the faeries blinded<br/>
&gt; us all a few times, gave everyone levitate, and left<br/>
&gt; citing the &quot;meanies who tried to hurt us&quot; as their<br/>
&gt; reason. It was pretty cool for my first GM event, and<br/>
&gt; if nothing else, levitate is a ton of fun, all the<br/>
&gt; newbies were having a blast with it. :) (I still think<br/>
&gt; the most frightening thing an Orc will ever see is a<br/>
&gt; flying halfling coming to cleave them in half ;)<br/>
