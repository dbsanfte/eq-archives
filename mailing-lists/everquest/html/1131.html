<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Question about other NPC&#39;s killing things. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698723936">No. NPCs can KS from you no matter how much damage you did to the enemy. If<br/>
the critter you are fighting is slain by an NPC you get no credit for it. I<br/>
guess they think that people would get lazy and have guards finish off the<br/>
creatures and that would be &quot;unfair&quot;.<br/>
Once I was fighting something and I managed to deliver the last blow even<br/>
though the guards had been hitting it and I still got xp. But sometimes if<br/>
the guards participate at all I get no xp. I think it&#39;s sort of buggy.<br/>
However, I think that you *should* get xp if you did more than 50% of the<br/>
damage. I have lost so many kills to guards bc the enemies ran to them to<br/>
escape from me. It&#39;s just stupid. I once nearly got killed and had an npc<br/>
down to about 5 hp. I was running after it hitting it desperately trying to<br/>
kill it before it got to the guards. Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t fast enough. The<br/>
guards got the last 5HP of damage and stole my kill. It was very<br/>
frustrating.<br/>
I actually submitted a complaint in /feedback.<br/>
I suggest you do the same.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; When you&#39;re fighting something, and you&#39;re so close to killing it, and a<br/>
&gt; guard or whatever comes along and deals the last blow, kills it, and it<br/>
&gt; vanishes....does that count like it killed it from beginning to end?<br/>
&gt; Doesn&#39;t it count if you do more than 50% of the damage to the critter?<br/>
