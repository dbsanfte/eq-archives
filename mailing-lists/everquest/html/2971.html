<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827195454">Cool. and one of the things I actually like about XP is that it is smarter<br/>
at shutting down. If I hit the button on the front of my computer to turn it<br/>
off, it tells itself to shut down XP and shuts it down properly.<br/>
Works really well when the power goes out and my freaking stupid backup unit<br/>
doesn&#39;t keep the monitor on. I used to have a backup that kept the monitor<br/>
on but it died. I wish I could find another one like it.<br/>
I was playing EQ the other night and a tree fell on my powerlines. :-(<br/>
It sucked.<br/>

    I now have windows xp and eq looks even better.  I still use a GeForce 4<br/>
MX 330 video card but the dirvers for windows xp make it WQHL certified and<br/>
it works fine.  just thought I would let everyone know.</div>
