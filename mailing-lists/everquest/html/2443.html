<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537014121">Well, since I am only lvl 30 on my highest character, I may well be <br/>
rich enough to spring for the big bucks when Barto reaches 55+. That <br/>
is after I get the high-level uber-gaming-platform costing only 3-4K.<br/>
And a dedicated room. Oh, and a really nice chair. And maybe my wife <br/>
will come to like the game, and really support me in these little <br/>
expenditures. <br/>
<br/>
Virtual/Alternate realities seem to be anchored by hard realities. <br/>
Money, or more particularly the absence of vast quantities of the <br/>
stuff. Time. Relationships and responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Still, dreams are nice, and sometimes come true.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The regular servers will be updated as usual, the legend servers <br/>
will<br/>
&gt; receive legend specific content that MAY be moved to normal servers <br/>
after<br/>
&gt; awhile. They have hired extra staff (among 19 GMs, there hsould be <br/>
gms<br/>
&gt; working 24/7 they say) that will ONLY be working with legend so <br/>
that it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t affect the normal servers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve not been online much due to overloaded at work but it seems <br/>
fun, alot<br/>
&gt; of nice events and good guilds. It&#39;s kinda easy to join a high-end <br/>
guild<br/>
&gt; since about 80% of the server is level 60.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It all looks very good so far.<br/>

&gt; Legend is $40 a month.  ALL new content in Everquest will go into <br/>
Legend<br/>
&gt; first, and normal servers will suffer because of it, only getting <br/>
new<br/>
&gt; updates as they filter out from Legend.  The new content and <br/>
improvements<br/>
&gt; will obviously come through to regular servers slower than in the <br/>
past, in<br/>
&gt; order for Verant to justify the high subscription to Legend and <br/>
keep those<br/>
&gt; few elite and rich players interested.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You might gather I dont subscribe to the Legend server :)<br/>

&gt; Anyone doing the new Legends thing? Looks cool, but the existing <br/>
game <br/>
&gt; is still enough for me. How much more are they asking for Legends <br/>
&gt; access? I never saw a price.<br/>
