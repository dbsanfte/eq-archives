<div id="ygrps-yiv-135697400">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have just bought the Everquest trilogy box and have played a few <br/>
times.  I have found a few helpful people out there but it seems most <br/>
are playing solo. Is this normal?  They suggest grouping so that is <br/>
my first question.<br/>
<br/>
Next, I am having trouble getting money to get decent weapons.<br/>
I am a level 3 Druid and only have a club.  One guy gave me some <br/>
money but it wasn&#39;t much.  He suggested buying more spells, but I <br/>
really would like a good weapon.  Dealing 1-3 points of damage just <br/>
isn&#39;t cutting it.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly for now, should I be starting with a fighter type until I <br/>
really get use the the game and interface.  I really love wizards and <br/>
those type of characters but understand if playing a warrior makes it <br/>
easier.<br/>
<br/>
I always get confused on where I am going. I think I venture too far <br/>
out of the city area.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for letting the newbie post?  ;)<br/>
<br/>
