<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954166004">After the last small patch, I couldn&#39;t get past the character select <br/>
screen either. I went into chat and asked the GM for help. He never <br/>
DID reply. But another player told me to right-click on my dial-up <br/>
connection, select properties. Then click on the &quot;Networking&quot; tab, <br/>
highlight &quot;QoS Packet Scheduler&quot; and uninstall it. This seemed to <br/>
work for me.<br/>

&gt; Speaking of bugs...<br/>
&gt; I was at the chat waiting for error 1018 to clear and the GM was <br/>
saying that<br/>
&gt; there is a known issue with dialup not letting people past <br/>
character select.<br/>
&gt; There are people with dialup accounts who haven&#39;t been able to <br/>
login for 2<br/>
&gt; months now.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m interested in hearing about other bug as well. I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
compiling<br/>
&gt; a list.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never had to hail the NPC to turn in quest stuff, but I <br/>
usually did<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; make sure I had the NPC I was looking for. I&#39;d also say it could <br/>
be a bug,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but we all know there isn&#39;t any bugs in EQ.<br/>
