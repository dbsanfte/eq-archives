<div id="ygrps-yiv-464686967">Thanks. So it is a LDON thing. My son has assumed financial<br/>
responsibility for the account, as he is the bigger player, has the<br/>
better computer and connection, and has joined the association of<br/>
&quot;responsible adults.&quot; I just grab a game now and then. I think he<br/>
plans to get the LDON expansion soon, so I guess adventures will wait<br/>
until then.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

&gt; message to meet a NPC. I had seen the message before, but since I had<br/>
&gt; nothing else going on, I responded. As a result I went searching for a<br/>
&gt; camp of adventurers. I talked to whom I had been directed to, and was<br/>
&gt; encouraged to go on missions for them. However, I haven&#39;t found anyone<br/>
&gt; in the camp in Butcherblock nor the camp in East Commonlands who will<br/>
&gt; give me a mission. Anyone know about this Adventure business, or some<br/>
&gt; place I can look?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, it was sure interesting spending the night in East Commonlands. It<br/>
&gt; used to be lowbee heaven, but I found myself actually fighting for my<br/>
&gt; life and wondering if I might actually have to run. It was rather fun.<br/>
&gt; A positive change.<br/>
