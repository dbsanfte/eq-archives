<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928218525">You....were able to quit? <br/>
How&#39;d you do it, a 12 step program right! Wait no, you went to EQA! Or<br/>
maybe you had a sponsor that you had to call when you were feeling weak?<br/>
Oh I hope you didn&#39;t have to go to the Betty Kobold clinic, I hear the<br/>
DT&#39;s are nasty!<br/>
Please tell us, we need help! <br/>
<br/>
Ha ha, j/k! I&#39;ll be on tonight, I&#39;ll see if they are around. Can&#39;t<br/>
guarantee I&#39;ll find them but I&#39;ll look just the same. ;-)<br/>

Subject: Howdy, anybody on Tribunal?<br/>
<br/>
Howdy, I used to be a huge EQ addict, but about a year ago I just <br/>
stopped playing. Since then I&#39;ve lost contact with all my friends <br/>
that made the game fun for me. If somebody could check to see if they <br/>
are still around get if so get them to email me at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bradleysmailaddress@...">bradleysmailaddress@...</a>. I was a 59 ogre sk named Protectorof, <br/>
my friends were named, Tval, Durtier, Dotts, and Hokyun. I would <br/>
greatly appreciate somebody taking the time to help me out.</div>
