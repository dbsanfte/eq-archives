<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889546681">Excuse me, but EQ techs actually tell people to disable their firewalls to<br/>
play the game!!! I have seen them do it at tech chats!<br/>
Alot of people don&#39;t know that they are at risk. Maybe if Verant warned them<br/>
it could happen they would know and understand how to protect themselves.<br/>
It&#39;s not their faults if they are ignorant of malicious hackers. Verant is<br/>
NOT ignorant of it.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s cause you are safe..  The odds of anyone hacking your system.. or<br/>

Sure it happens every now and then due to the lack of players realizing<br/>
their personal responsibility to protect themselves on the Internet.  If<br/>
your handing your account information out to other players/not running<br/>
uptodate anti-virus programs/personal firewalls/etc. then they have no one<br/>
to blame but themselves.  There&#39;s certainly more personal information about<br/>
them that would be more important to &quot;hackers&quot; other then your Everquest<br/>
account.  Those protection programs are easy to install and maintain - most<br/>
are automatic with the least amount of input from the end-user.  If someone<br/>
is &quot;sniffing&quot; the packets from your computer, you&#39;ve got a much larger<br/>
problem then worrying if they have compromised your EQ account.<br/>
