I am <br>currently running a 1.2 gHz Gateway Athlon system with 512 MB of PC- 133<br>SDRAM, nVidia GeForce 2 Ultra with 64 MB, and a Sound Blaster <br>Live! X-Gamer 5.1 sound card. Operating System is Windows XP Home <br>Edition. Connection is via aDSL. I have downloaded and installed all <br>the latest drivers.<br><br>My sound, particularly the music, &quot;stutters&quot; and repeats in the game <br>to the point it is almost unbearably annoying and I have to turn the <br>speakers off or way down. It does not appear to affect the video <br>and/or gameplay, but I should think my system is more than adequate <br>to play the game with sound turned on. <br><br>I do have the Luclin expansion, and I have turned on a FEW of the <br>new skins, but only those of the races and genders of my own <br>characters: Wood Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, and Human (necessary to <br>display Erudite). I also have horses and elementals turned on, but <br>that is all. Social animations, mip mapping, texture mapping, and <br>texture compression are off.<br><br>I have tried turning the sound acceleration down in Control Panel, <br>but that appears to have no effect on the choppiness of the sound. I <br>also turned sound realism up and turned off reverb by using /reverb <br>in the chat box, at one person&#39;s suggestion. Does anyone have any <br>ideas/tips/solutions? <br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Froondor Oakenbark, 41 Wood Elf Druid male<br>Froontor Whipslash, 29 Barbarian Warrior male(retired)<br>Froondar Oakenbark, 27 Wood Elf Warrior male<br>Texxas Rannger, 21 Wood Elf Ranger male<br>Froonvah, 12 Vah Shir Beastlord male<br>Froondoc, 11 Dwarf Cleric male<br>Squiddles, 9 Vah Shir Shaman female<br>Froonlea, 4 Erudite Wizard female<br><br>All on Tarew Marr<br><br><br><br><br>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com/">http://www.everquest.com</a><br><br><br>Your use of Yahoo!
