&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everything is camped. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your corpse will always end up halfway inside a mountain, nowhere in <br/>
&gt; sight of the roads, or under a tree. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The skeleton in front of you is there to distract you from the <br/>
&gt; Kodiak approaching behind you. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your attack is going really well, you are in an ambush. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the MOBs are within range, so are you. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The tougher MOBs invariably attack on two occasions: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; when they&#39;re ready. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; when you&#39;re not. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One MOB is never enough, but two can be entirely too many. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The MOB is not retreating; it&#39;s just going to get its friends. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The MOBs you never encounter when armed and buffed always appear <br/>
&gt; during your corpse run. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The MOB you&#39;ve been camping for hours always spawns 18 seconds after <br/>
&gt; you leave. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Teamwork is essential; it gives the MOBs other people to attack. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t ever be the first, don&#39;t ever be the last, and don&#39;t ever <br/>
&gt; volunteer to do anything. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The greatest danger to your group is a Paladin with a map and a <br/>
&gt; plan. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When the going gets tough, the tank goes linkdead. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A group without healers or bandages is not a group for long. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your buffs will fade when you need them the most. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whenever you have plenty of mana, you never miss. Whenever you are <br/>
&gt; low on mana, every spell fizzles. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When in doubt, gate. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is not a single bathroom in all of Norrath. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Armor Class of a piece of armor is inversely proportional as to <br/>
&gt; how good it looks on you. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The item that you want the most drops the rarest. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The item that you want the most is out of your price range. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The item that you want the most was sold at an auction while you <br/>
&gt; were offline. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The item that you want the most was picked up by some moron who <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know the definition of &quot;No Drop&quot;. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The item you&#39;ll need tomorrow is No Rent. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The item you accidentally drop will be the most <br/>
&gt; valuable/powerful/important item you carry. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you can afford it, it&#39;s not for sale. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you want two of them, it&#39;s a Lore item. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you want to sell it, it&#39;s a No Drop item. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The High Quality Bear Skin drops every 28 days, the same schedule as <br/>
&gt; PMS. Coincidence? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even greens kill. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Backstab means never having to say you&#39;re sorry. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A bow without arrows seems awfully heavy all of a sudden. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Merchants are perfectly capable of kicking tail and taking names. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Trains have the right of way. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s stupid but it works, it isn&#39;t stupid. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The guards are never there when you need them. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Misuse of a combine button in a hurry = highly colorful language. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The time it takes to upload the newest patch is directly <br/>
&gt; proportional to your eagerness to log on. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No two people have ever agreed on a single, precise definition of a <br/>
&gt; twink. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Never forget that your newbie weapon was crafted by the lowest <br/>
&gt; bidder. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A roleplayer drinks to increase his alcohol tolerance; an idiot does <br/>
&gt; it in the Kelethin treetops. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having a tenth of a bubble of health left is Nature&#39;s way of telling <br/>
&gt; you to slow down. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gnome wizards are proof positive that size does not matter. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The greatest mystery in Norrath is how NPCs figure out what religion <br/>
&gt; you are just by looking at you. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Every shaman on Norrath at one point in his or her life has done the <br/>
&gt; pig joke when someone asked for a SOW. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Only twelve people in all of Norrath are truly happy with their last <br/>
&gt; names. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The last bubble takes forever to fill. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is somehow discouraging to realize that Qeynos is &quot;SonyEQ&quot; <br/>
&gt; spelled backwards. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&quot;Never stop believing that, if nothing else, things change, and evolve into the light, and all chaos will cease. Live for love and love will live for you. I wish you Heaven.&quot;<br/>
