<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271944220">At level 5 its 30mins.  Whether your online or not.  What I might suggest<br/>
for the future is to know your surrounds: roads, landmarks, certain shops,<br/>
etc..  Stick to the roads, it might not be the most direct route, however<br/>
they will lead you to your destination.  As far as finding your corpse,<br/>
invest in a Chipbone Rod or two and place them in the bank (remember that<br/>
when you died your nekid - store them in the bank or they will be useless<br/>
:).  You can find them normally at a merchant with shaman supplies and<br/>
potions.  They are a few platinum, however are worth it if you don&#39;t know<br/>
where your corpse is.  Simply target yourself ( or whomever your trying to<br/>
locate a corpse for ) in the zone where your target died, and right click.<br/>
This will cause you to point in the direction your corpse is located.  It<br/>
has a few charges and works quite nicely.<br/>
<br/>
Else do a /who bard, or /who necro.  Both of those classes get a corpse<br/>
locating song/spell before they reach lvl 6.  In most cases, if not all,<br/>
they will be happy to help you find your corpse for little compensation.  I<br/>
still keep a rod on me, I never know when a friend of mine will be stuck<br/>
somewhere, not knowing where they died.  And its nice to be able to find it<br/>
for them.<br/>

Hi Tammy,<br/>
    I heard it was 48 in real time hours, (your average daily time).<br/>
<br/>
Getting suff back can depend a little on where you died and if you can find<br/>
youself. I died once in some place, (Don&#39;t remember know, just finally gave<br/>
up), Couldn&#39;t find it and basically had to start over. One thing I do is if<br/>
you can get a couple of good weapons for your character is to place one in<br/>
the bank, that way if you die you can go to the bank and get it out so you<br/>
can go get your corpse. At least you&#39;ll have some weaponry to defend<br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Also if you died at Orc hill or somewhere like that try to group and see if<br/>
they would cover you until you can get all your stuff back.<br/>
