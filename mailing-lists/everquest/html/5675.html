&gt; Thank you for contacting the Sony Online<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, the only way to receive the downloads<br/>
&gt; is to use the <br/>
&gt; Patcher.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You might also want to copy the EQ directory from an<br/>
&gt; updated computer <br/>
&gt; that has EQ.  You would still need to perform a full<br/>
&gt; scan, but it would <br/>
&gt; greatly reduce the download time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They LIES!!! Following instruction JUST AS THEY SAY.. I downloaded, <br/>
burned to cds and then copied over the folder.. when I run the <br/>
everquest.exe it check for files in folder and found disrepancy in <br/>
everquest.exe and testeverquest.exe GRR seems like the executable <br/>
files for dial-up and cable connection are different or somehow its <br/>
logged to a specific IP add.<br/>
<br/>
Browsing through the everquest.log file and then getting help from <br/>
some friends at forum.. I just run the eqgame.exe with patchme <br/>
behind it, to &quot;trick&quot; the game into NOT patching.. WOW I manage to <br/>
log in.. even chat with GM in the chat board inside, grr no help <br/>
coming from the grumpy GM too.. I tried clicking PLAY button, <br/>
connected in SUPER FAST speed.. u know, that Firiona Vie loading <br/>
screen, that has loading froglock under it (saw some funny msg <br/>
there, about fippy and anyone ever read this msg jokes).. took about <br/>
2-4seconds to load the world, and the NEW chars models looks great, <br/>
somehow ALL my chars look different, erudite looks so tall and bald, <br/>
my high elf female cleric looks strange, like a bronze amazon, when <br/>
I recalled she looks like Firiona Vie 3 years ago.. sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Clicking on any of the characters.. of course crash me back, giving <br/>
bit failed error something msg. Now, I am trying to download the <br/>
everquest.exe and testeverquest.exe and whatever various files they <br/>
r throwing at me, since I had manage to download 2.7gig already at <br/>
the cable company. Good luck to me.. camping mobs didnt cost me so <br/>
much time and money, GRR!</div>
