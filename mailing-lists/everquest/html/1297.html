found this spot a while back, well I am sure I am not the only one to find it 
but you know what I mean.&nbsp; Velkor&#39;s Labyrinth (sp?) is really good exp for 
mid 40&#39;s to 52 at the zone in.&nbsp; There are spiders that spawn at the zone 
must be 20 or more that you can pull without going too deep and getting to any 
of the traps.&nbsp; The experience here was really well and the mobs kind of 
reminded me of LDC&#39;s (only their dot isn&#39;t nearly as bad, or it didn&#39;t seem so) 
as far as HP&#39;s went.&nbsp; So they really didn&#39;t take too long to kill and they 
have some nice rare/random drops they also can drop gems for the Thur quest 
armor.&nbsp; I got a silk something or other glove for pure caster it was 4ac 
3int 35mana and some saves.&nbsp; Well, talk more later.</span></font></div>
