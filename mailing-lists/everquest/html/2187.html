&gt; Very weird. Was there anything different about the gnomes? Did they <br/>
have red<br/>
&gt; text for their names?<br/>
&gt; if not, then bug report it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I play a level 16 barbarian shaman, and lately ive been trying <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; fight and level in Oasis of Marr.  Usually im in a group, and as<br/>
&gt; &gt; happens when fighiting in Oasis, usually one or more of my party<br/>
&gt; &gt; members gets rabies or is poisoned by whatever mob we are <br/>
fighting at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the time.  Since as a shaman i have Cure Disease (which cures <br/>
rabies)<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Cure Poison, i keep them memmed so that if a party member is<br/>
&gt; &gt; poisoned or becomes rabid, i can cure them (most of the time, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; works on the first cast, the second one if nothing else).  The <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; &gt; day, i was grouped with two gnomes, one a warrior and the <br/>
other... i<br/>
&gt; &gt; cant remember, but he was a gnome too, and another barbarian.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; were fighting a madman or zombie or something like that, and <br/>
everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; but me got rabies.  I healed the barbarian of it no sweat, but i <br/>
used<br/>
&gt; &gt; up my entire mana bar trying to heal the gnomes!  For some <br/>
reason, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldnt work, no matter how many times i cast it!  So i went to <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; dock and there were some other random people that were rabid too, <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; i healed them without a problem, but i still couldnt heal the<br/>
&gt; &gt; gnomes!! Should i report this as a bug or is this just something <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the norm?  Help on this matter would be appreciated!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank you sooooo much,<br/>
