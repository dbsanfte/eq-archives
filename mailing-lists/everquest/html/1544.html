<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699362415">I would bet this crashing when she zones is a sound card problem. I would<br/>
suggest disable the sound card, start eq and try zoning. If she zones fine<br/>
and does not crash, she&#39;ll need to buy a better sound card. I had the same<br/>
problem, switched sound cards and it was solved. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
	I have a friend who is having an unusually difficult time signing on<br/>
and<br/>
	staying online.  It seems that just about any time she zones, you<br/>
can<br/>
	assume she will not be on anymore.<br/>
<br/>
	Is this a common problem?  Does anyone have some &quot;quick fix&quot; ideas<br/>
that<br/>
	might keep her from being punted so easily?<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks for any help.<br/>
<br/>
