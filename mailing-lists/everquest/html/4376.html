<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-33744804">I am new here, my sister recommended this group to me.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question. I enjoy being an Enchantress because I am looking <br/>
forward to some of the cool spells that I will eventually get (Charm, <br/>
KEI, etc.) I just made Level 10 and am scared to death now because <br/>
I&#39;m afraid of getting killed, not being able to get back to my <br/>
corpse, and losing all my stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I joined a website that lists quests and the levels you can complete <br/>
the quests at, the site says you can complete the Stein of Moggok <br/>
quest at level 8. I have components to make a Stein of Moggok, have <br/>
the book to get another Stein, but when I try to give bartender Clurg <br/>
the book, his body guard knocks me on my butt. And I can&#39;t use the <br/>
Dark Elf Ill. spell until level 12, so why does everyone say that you <br/>
can finish the quest at 8?<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other quests that low-level Enchantress&#39;s can do to get <br/>
nice equipment, money and experience?<br/>
<br/>
Please help a lady out? Thanks much.</div>
