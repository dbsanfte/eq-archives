<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586098961">Ok, I can answer my own question here. I found out from a GM that the <br/>
stein is LORE/NO DROP. I have one in the bank that I bought about a <br/>
month ago, and that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t complete the quest the other 2X. <br/>
I guess I will either try and sell the one I have or give it to <br/>
someone and complete the quest over and over again for the exp.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder why there aren&#39;t more quests for Enchanters though, and why <br/>
there aren&#39;t ANY especially for Erudite Enchanters :(<br/>

&gt; Have a question. I did the Stein Quest twice today. Cast <br/>
Illusion:DE <br/>
&gt; on my Lvl 14 Erudite Enchanter, and cast Alliance on Clurg. I <br/>
conned <br/>
&gt; Clurg as Amiable both times. Both times I said &quot;What special book&quot;, <br/>
&gt; he replied, and I gave him the compodium. Then he said something <br/>
&gt; like &quot;You must have worked hard to get my book, I am indebted to <br/>
you. <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like being indebted, so take this as payment&quot;. He didn&#39;t <br/>
give <br/>
&gt; me anything; no PP, no stein. I petitioned the GM. Does anyone have <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; clue as to what is going on? </span></blockquote></div>
