<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580504368">I was in GD today and was slicing through wurms with my trusty <br/>
necromantic pet when 2 more wurms jumped me and i had to run.  The <br/>
closest zone was thurgadin and i had to pray to cazic-thule that the <br/>
coldain didn&#39;t hate Iksar Necromancers.<br/>
I had heard about a wedding being held earlier and i remembered that <br/>
it was at the waterfall by thurgadin so i shouted train to thurgadin <br/>
and remembered that i could FD so i did to make sure that i wasn&#39;t <br/>
killed and that the wurms did&#39;t spoil the wedding.  Luckily i was far <br/>
enough from the wedding that the wurms ran back to their caves.<br/>
Heres where it stars...  First of all the wedding was in OOC.  Bad <br/>
choice.  Second the peeps of the wedding kept telling people in the <br/>
zone to &quot;Shutup&quot; or &quot;Stfu&quot;  That was being rude.  I proceeded to tell <br/>
them that they should hold a wedding in SAY or a seperate channel.  <br/>
They all got pissed at me and everyone there kept vowing revenge on <br/>
me.  Made me a bit mad but i held it in so that i didn&#39;t purposefully <br/>
give them a reason to get mad.  They continued to nag on and on so i <br/>
allerted my guild and they all thought the same thing.  A Wedding <br/>
should be held in private chat and if others talk in the zone just <br/>
filter the ooc and shouts.  The wedding was very badly planned and <br/>
now i have a whole guild mad at me.  ( the other guild that was <br/>
having the marriage not mine)  I was wondering what you all think of <br/>
weddings in EQ and was i justified in shouting train and telling them <br/>
that they should hold their wedding in private if they don&#39;t want to <br/>
hear all the shouts and ooc&#39;s of a zone.  <br/>
