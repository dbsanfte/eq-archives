<div id="ygrps-yiv-41227807"><p>As a guide, we don&#39;t have the ability to change a person&#39;s surname.&nbsp; This being the case I never got exposed to the possible valid characters than can be used beyond the &quot; &#39; &quot;.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure its certainly possible to use ahyphen, however, I&#39;ve never witnessed a character name that included one.&nbsp;&nbsp; My suggestion would probably be to decide on a new one you both agree upon.. and if you claim devoice, your old one can be restored.</p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty much been&nbsp;agreed by most polls that a vast majority of PC&#39;s are male ( whether they appear male or female).&nbsp; My guild consist mainly of RL couples, which is great because&nbsp;then tend to be more mature overall.&nbsp; They also certainly give a balance to the guild and I enjoy that immensely.</p>
<p>btw..&nbsp; Verant has no policy for or against in game marriages.&nbsp;&nbsp; They leave it up to the CS staff assigned to the server.&nbsp; In game issues, harassment and&nbsp;a host of other problems are the priority.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will say there are a few guides+ that enjoy bringing characters together and have developt ceremonial scripts for weddings.&nbsp; Send a petition well in advance of the date in which you wish to get married.&nbsp; The information of Time/Place/Player Names are collected and posted at the end of the shift.&nbsp; On our server we had a calendar of sorts which listed the upcoming events which included weddings.</p>
