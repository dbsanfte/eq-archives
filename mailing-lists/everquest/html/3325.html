<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920145358">I went to the new Jaggedpine zone tonight, as soon I got through with <br/>
all the patches.  It is beautifully done, and well populated with <br/>
mobs in my level range.  I&#39;m not sure about merchants, but there is a <br/>
banker.  Some people were having trouble binding there, so you may <br/>
want to go to Qeynos first.<br/>
<br/>
For all you cityfolk you get there through Surefall Glade.  It is in <br/>
the caves behind the falls.  And there also appear to be some new <br/>
quest people around.  And make sure you wipe you feet!  You&#39;re in my <br/>
house now.<br/>
<br/>
The new UI looks good, and the spell icons are great.  Now I don&#39;t <br/>
have to figure out which buff is going, or which one I&#39;m missing.  It <br/>
did need some rearranging, but overall it&#39;s an improvement.<br/>
