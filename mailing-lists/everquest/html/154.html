<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206878591">The actual text says &quot;Good idea. Post full walkthroughs and mark them with a<br/>
warning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Stupid thing about the Stratics page - you can&#39;t see the results without<br/>
voiting.  I already voted - and despite the fact I&#39;m from Chicago (well, 10<br/>
blocks north of Chicago, but I was born in the city and let&#39;s net get too<br/>
technical) I don&#39;t want to vote twice.<br/>
<br/>
I voted for that - but I haven&#39;t looked at any of the walkthroughs.  I&#39;d<br/>
rather they post them for the powergamers and lazy types so I&#39;m not spammed<br/>
with shouts or oocs asking for help in-game.  With this posted - anyone who<br/>
does yell for help on a quest is someone you REALLY know hasn&#39;t bothered to<br/>
find anything else out on their own..<br/>

&gt; this is pretty lame... this is an RPG, but on all the polls, people want<br/>
&gt; walkthroughs on quests? where is the fun in that? maybe a hint or 2, but<br/>
its<br/>
&gt; no fun walking around following a guide telling you to avoid so and so<br/>
&gt; whatever to not get killed.<br/>
&gt; just wondering if anyone aggrees with this...<br/>
