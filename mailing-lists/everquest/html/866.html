<div id="ygrps-yiv-56426338">That&#39;s true, but it&#39;s not the whole story.    On the regular (non-PK) servers,<br/>
once you turn in that book and become PK you can ONLY PK other players who<br/>
have also turned in the book.  You can not PK the playres who did not become<br/>
PK.  Additionally, non-PK players cannot cast any spells on you.  That means<br/>
no heals, no SOW&#39;s, no Clarity, No Buffs!<br/>
