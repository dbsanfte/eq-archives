<br/>
yes, you can filter out unwanted chat and melee hits.<br/>
It&#39;s under Options, then Keyboard, I think. Or maybe<br/>
not, lol. Can&#39;t remember right now.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I do, is create a seperate chat window<br/>
just for group chat. Right click on the top of your<br/>
chat window where it says Main chat, click new chat<br/>
window, then rearrange and resize all your windows<br/>
untill you get a setup that you can work with and live<br/>
with. I try to keep both my chat boxes at the bottom,<br/>
and made a bit smaller so that they both are<br/>
side-by-side.<br/>
<br/>
As for the shaman advice, I myself have never played<br/>
one. But I do know that they are mostly wanted in<br/>
groups for their great buffs and their ability to slow<br/>
the mob. Also, if you have a cleric in your group,<br/>
shaman are great back-up healers.<br/>

&gt; ever in the <br/>
&gt; camp in the Northern end of Paludal Caverns. I had<br/>
&gt; no idea what to <br/>
&gt; do so I kept everybody healed. My character is a<br/>
&gt; level 23 shaman. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I was told that I should be giving everybody<br/>
&gt; dex buffs instead. <br/>
&gt; So I did. I told everyone that to tell me when they<br/>
&gt; needed more <br/>
&gt; buffing. Then, after a while, I was told about<br/>
&gt; something called a <br/>
&gt; gropu channel and that I ought to click &quot;say&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Note that I gathered that while watching text scroll<br/>
&gt; up and off my <br/>
&gt; screen faster than I could read it. Everytime that a<br/>
&gt; mob bealched, I <br/>
&gt; got a line of text. Things were very lively.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m level 24 now. I figured out that right clicking<br/>
&gt; the dialog bar <br/>
&gt; will pull a box that will let me filter out<br/>
&gt; everything but group <br/>
&gt; chat using group-say.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How is a shaman important to a group? What does the<br/>
&gt; group need most <br/>
&gt; from the shaman? What is a shaman expected to know?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My character is Gunli on the Luclin server.<br/>
