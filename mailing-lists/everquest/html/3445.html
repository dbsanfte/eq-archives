<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962987763">heheh you and me both Su.  those floors are  dangerous as all get out. Kinda<br/>
reminds me of the time I first went on a guild raid to Lguk and fell off the<br/>
narrow boards and was immediately agroed by the mobs and it took over 4<br/>
hours for them to find my corpse lol and I was bound  umm in all places<br/>
Neriak heh had been bound there since I was born and I was a level 23 atm<br/>
lol<br/>
<br/>
but the secret  of course when going up some of the icy ones is to look<br/>
walk with sow off  follow someone who has been there before and  who can<br/>
show you  exactly where to step etc.  It took me only  one fall and  2 trips<br/>
getting form the zone entrance in GD to the upper area  to the Tents to<br/>
learn how to get up that far safely. getting out though was the bad part<br/>
cause part of the way you cant get out the same way you got in lol so I<br/>
wound up doing the ninja  zone where I faced a certain wall in the pit<br/>
invised so not to get agro  ran into the wall and camped out came back<br/>
camped out again and was back at zone entrance to GD.<br/>
<br/>
As for the crowding yeah we get that on  the Saryn server as of late as<br/>
well.  Our Raid coordinator for my guild  got a bunch of us together   and<br/>
had us camp there and  each of us would play an alt and he would join<br/>
whatever group was at the tents and let us know in raid chat what class was<br/>
leaving and to have the corresponding guildy log on that char  in Velks and<br/>
fill in the slot till we had all guildies in the group lol.  we spent a<br/>
whole weekend doing this and we eventually had it to where  except for once<br/>
or twice we had nothing but guildies  at the tents in Velks<br/>

&gt; Velks is good. I don&#39;t like going up high there. I made it to 51 and 52 in<br/>
&gt; Velks. But lately it&#39;s been too crowded and I haven&#39;t been able to find a<br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
&gt; Im not familiar with the tent. I do the floor where you come in either in<br/>
&gt; one of the side rooms or on the middle room in the back. I&#39;ve sometimes<br/>
gone<br/>
&gt; up to SH. I really hate going up those narrow passageways though.<br/>
especially<br/>
&gt; with the slippery ice.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
