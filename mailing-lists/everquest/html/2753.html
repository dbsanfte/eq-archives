<div id="ygrps-yiv-425100042">Thanks for the explanation of the wisdom/mana relationship. I have a<br/>
question, though, about one of the other points you brought up.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard of quad-kiting, but never really gotten a good explanation of<br/>
it. Since you have done it, could you explain?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; mana boosts are better at lower levels than stat<br/>
&gt; &gt; boosts which are better at higher levels. In the<br/>
&gt; &gt; past you maxed your Wis at 200 then got mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; boosting items. Now I think it maxes at 250.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Close. The WIS maximum has always been 255, but before<br/>
&gt; Luclin WIS above 200 only gave one point of mana per<br/>
&gt; point of WIS. They loosened the soft cap around the<br/>
&gt; release of Luclin, so now each point of WIS above 200<br/>
&gt; gives around 5-6 mana. In my experience (44 Druid is<br/>
&gt; my main) the best bet is to get WIS up to the 200 cap<br/>
&gt; then start shopping for resist and mana items. There&#39;s<br/>
&gt; quite a few very inexpensive items with major WIS<br/>
&gt; boosts available.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To the other guy, at 33 you&#39;re high enough to be<br/>
&gt; leveling in Velious, i&#39;d recommend heading over there<br/>
&gt; ASAP. I started by root and rotting Snow Cougars in<br/>
&gt; Iceclad til 34, then quad kiting them til 38. (I<br/>
&gt; believe it was 38 that they started conning light<br/>
&gt; blue, might have been 37) From there you can do<br/>
&gt; Drakkel Dire Wolves in GD for faction or quad Ulthorks<br/>
&gt; in EW for amazing loot and good xp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The side perk of hunting in Velious is that&#39;s where<br/>
&gt; the higher levels tend to congregate these days. Drop<br/>
&gt; your bind at the bank in Thurg and keep an eye out for<br/>
&gt; those 100pp port requests. *grin*<br/>
