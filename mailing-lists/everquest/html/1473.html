<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] money problem <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755095145">I sometimes have a hard time not getting stuff. I&#39;ll be running around and<br/>
people will offer me stuff. Or I&#39;ll stop to tell someone their shield looks<br/>
cool or that I think their name is cool (not trying to get anything, just<br/>
being friendly). Or I help people find stuff and I chat with people.<br/>
Sometimes people give me stuff just for making them laugh. There was another<br/>
player who was trying to figure out how to get money. I told her &quot;just be<br/>
friendly. Talk to people. But don&#39;t do it for money. Just try to have fun.&quot;.<br/>
Later she told me that she tried that and someone gave her 60pp.<br/>
luv,<br/>
