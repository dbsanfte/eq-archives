&gt; I am sure there are some good ranger 2-hand blunt weapons out there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes there are.  But the problem with 2hb is that there are so many better<br/>
weapons for the other weapons types that you rarely find a good 2hb to work<br/>
up your skill until the later levels.  I have 200+ skill in 1 and 2hs, 1hb,<br/>
and piercing but I&#39;ve never found a 2hb weapon that I could raise skill<br/>
with.  Maybe I&#39;ll get lucky and win a roll on a Woodsman&#39;s staff one day and<br/>
be able to use that.<br/>
<br/>
There are good 2hb weapons......it&#39;s just that there are so many other<br/>
better weapons that are easier to get.</div>
