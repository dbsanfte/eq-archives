<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140727925"><p><font face="Courier New">What is their policy in cases of harassment? Or in cases where harassment leads to one player purposely pulling a train of high lvl mobs onto lower lvl characters and getting them killed on purpose just to harass one of the lower lvl characters in that area?</font></p>
<p>They actually take these pretty seriously.&nbsp; When they receive a petition concerning harassment as you have described they will zone in the zone and switch to hidden.&nbsp;&nbsp; While hidden they can investigate the matter concealed from view ( completely invisible, and cannot be searched via /w).&nbsp; They are to investigate the matter for evidence that can be gathered thru observations, they will confront the aggressor and issue a warning.&nbsp; Depending on the number of warnings, normally three, they will be suspended for a week.&nbsp; For a year now they have also been given the ablity to&nbsp;assign information to&nbsp;your&nbsp;soulmark.&nbsp; That mark will carry possitive or negative notes concerning your account and it will follow you no matter what character or server you reside.&nbsp; That information can be viewed on/offline to determine the best action to take.&nbsp;&nbsp; They should also remind you to use the /report command to save your chat window text.&nbsp; That information can be easliy accessed by the servers GM for evidence. ( they dont accept screenshots )</p>
<p>The peition itself will be relayed to the servers bulletin board at the end of the shift.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will note: (a) the petitioner, (b) the accused, (c) any information the guide was able to collect and (d) what was the outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The information is posted for review by all server CS staff, keeping them informed of daily happenings.&nbsp; There are parser programs that filter the information of a guides logs.&nbsp; Can list every petition they handled.. all their conversations.. every zone they were in.. the time it took handle each petition.. and any notes they care to add.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
