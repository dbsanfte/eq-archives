<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899279624">I am building a new computer and I was wondering if any of you have had any<br/>
experience with the Voodoo3 2000. Does it give good enough performance to<br/>
warrant buying it? Also would the following system give good performance on<br/>
EverQuest?<br/>
<br/>
Celeron 433<br/>
128 MB PC100 SDRAM<br/>
Diamond Monster MX300<br/>
Abit BX6 Rev2<br/>
Maxtor 10.2GB 5400 RPM<br/>
Diamond SupraExress 56K Internal ISA<br/>
<br/>
Also I&#39;ve been seeing that the Cable Modems aren&#39;t that good for EQ, but I<br/>
was wondering how bad are they? Will they get at least better performance<br/>
than a 56K? Answers to any of these questions would be very appreciated.<br/>
