<div id="ygrps-yiv-676189427"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">There&#39;s this necro, he&#39;s level 55, I know him in RL, I group mostly with his 49 warrior than his necro. He telled me yesterday, asking me if I would group with him and his friend in SS. I left DL to go. He told me that he wanted a robe that drops and he wouldn&#39;t get exp but I would so he got the robe. Fine, whatever, I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s better to just keep my mouth shut and not worry about loot. If I get something good, great. If not, oh well. 
<br>
<br>His friend kept going LD so it ws just us. Well, I ended up getting killed because he wanted me to pull because to help save on his pet. Ok, no big deal. I should have told him no. 
<br>
<br>Ok I camp and then last night, when I logged back in, I grouped with him and 2 other friends that live near me too. Ok, soon after we get there, the sentry robe drops. It&#39;s no drop. Magic and lore. AC 11 +5 Str, +5 Dex, +9 Int, +20 mana. It looks pretty much identical to the blackened crystalline robe. He automatically loots it and starts to celebrate. Well, I stayed there with them all through the night. The 41 warrior got alot of nice guardian armor. And the druid got a couple drops as well. Now, I&#39;m not one to complain about not getting anything. I was getting exp and I was helping them. No big deal. 
<br>
<br>Well then the necro keeps saying to me we&#39;ll get you a robe too. He said there&#39;s a better robe that drops too. A guardian robe. He says no matter if it&#39;s sentry or guardian that drops next, I get it. He says I&#39;m promise you we&#39;ll get that robe. I camped there with them until 6 AM this morning. No, actually, it was 7 AM. I camped when I went to wake everyone up. Ok so the druid had already left. The warrior and the necro were left. The necro told me that he would call me if a robe dropped and I could log in and get it. Sounded like a good plan. I&#39;m camped at the zone. Ok, great. 
<br>
<br>Well, it&#39;s almost noon and I hadn&#39;t heard from him. I decided to log in and see how things were going. He had told me he planned to camp there all day too and get armor for his warrior and his girlfriend. So another RL friend who wasn&#39;t on with us last night was on. I sent him and tell and asked where the necro was. He said he did you dirty. I was like huh? He said the other robe dropped, the guardian robe, right after you camped and he looted it and the 41 warrior friend who was there told him to call me and he said no. The warrior told this friend about it. 
<br>
<br>I was stunned. I was like what???? I didn&#39;t ask for the robe but he kept saying we&#39;d get it and he&#39;d call and he promised and he kept telling me all night while we were getting that armor how great the group was doing and how we were all gonna get nice loot. I couldn&#39;t believe he would be that greedy. 
<br>
<br>The stats on the guardian robe is magic no drop lore AC12 +5 Sta, +9 Int, +45 Mana, +8 fire. It&#39;s blue with like red and purple trimming. Well, either robe would be fine with me. Both are +9 Int and I&#39;m wearing a blackened crystalline robe now. 
<br>
<br>I just can&#39;t believe he did that. Well, I&#39;ve always known he was greedy but gosh, I am still shocked. So while I was in game talking to my friend who told me, I called the necro and asked how things were going, and told him I just wondered about if the robe had dropped. He said no, but we&#39;ll get it. So then he lied to me. 
<br>
<br>My friend said he told him that what he did was wrong and dirty and that he would have dueled him in real life for something like that. Well, I&#39;m not going to challenge him to a duel lol but I&#39;m not going to group with him or pass out the crack or speed anymore. 
<br>
<br>My friend said he and his brother would go to SS tonight with me to get the robe for me but it&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t get the robe that makes me mad. It&#39;s the fact that he did me like that. If he would have even said you know what, the other robe dropped and I wanted it so I looted it and we&#39;ll keep camping to get yours, I would still think he was a greedy butthole but that he even lied about it. He thinks that the warrior that was with him or the other friend won&#39;t tell me. 
<br>
<br>Ok, so I&#39;m going to complain about this all day long until I get it vented out of my system. One good thing, it&#39;s given me some nice cleaning energy. My bathroom has never shined so nicely. 
<br>
<br>Oh and you know what, I&#39;m a 40 enchanter, he&#39;s a 55 necro. He could get better loot somewhere else. I think he&#39;s just too much of a greedy you know what that probably no higher levels want to group with him. And all that telling me he can&#39;t wait for me to get my enchanter up in the 50s... Too bad now. I only group with friends.
