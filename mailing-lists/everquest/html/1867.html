 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re a shorty on a PvP server don&#39;t wander around Greater <br/>
Faydark unless you have a lot of confidence (or a suicide wish.)  Try <br/>
not to get lost and never, ever, zone unless you know where you are <br/>
going.  <br/>
<br/>
Get one of your friends to help you.  Don&#39;t be afraid to shout for <br/>
help.  People will usually give it.  Be nice to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t waste mana and don&#39;t waste money.  It may seem trivial at the <br/>
first few levels (&quot;8 copper for a ruined wolf pelt?  Yee hah!&quot;) but <br/>
believe me, if you concentrate on experience alone, you are going to <br/>
find yourself broke in a hurry.  You need money to get spells and <br/>
food.<br/>
<br/>
In the first few lvls you don&#39;t need to loot your corpse.  Lvl 4 and <br/>
up you will.  Very important: if you have a poor sense of direction, <br/>
always always always type &quot;/loc&quot; when you&#39;re in a losing battle.  <br/>
This saves you walking all along the zone wailing &quot;Has anyone seen my <br/>
corpse?&quot; and tensely counting down your 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Find a race and class that will fit your needs.  Talk to your friends <br/>
on this.  They can give you great tips, I bet.  This is important.   <br/>
<br/>
Finally, just have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
