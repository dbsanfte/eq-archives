<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019846467">When I dinged level 11 the game sent me an email saying I could hunt in blackburrow. If you can actually make it to blackburrow safely it wasn&#39;t so bad from what I recall.<br/>
Another spot is East Commons. Hunting the lions, bears, and orcs. then you can move to west commons for the dervs and higher level bears. Just don&#39;t attack any near the druid ring.. oh wait.. just dont&#39; go near the druid ring. Killing the deathfist orcs gets you faction with freeport so it&#39;s good to do that.<br/>

&gt;New to the group so I thought I would drop in and say hello. I played <br/>
&gt;EQ some time ago, six or seven years and it&#39;s changed quite a bit to <br/>
&gt;say the least. I do like the Tutorial, which allowed me to create a <br/>
&gt;character and get him to 10-11th level in no time at all. Now being <br/>
&gt;12th level, I play a Troll SK, what&#39;s a good place to hunt. I group <br/>
&gt;when I can but the servers not always busy. Looking for good xp and <br/>
&gt;coin of course. Figured Befallen or the Lava fields.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks to all<br/>
