<br/>
 Grogg opened his eyes.  The first rays of sunlight were creeping their way<br/>
into his tent.  Somewhere in his dream he had heard the bell that signaled a<br/>
new day at the orc training camp.  His orc brain was slow to respond to the<br/>
waking process, and several thoughts went through his head as he tried to<br/>
struggle against the grasping roots of drowsiness. Grogg thought back to<br/>
what he was dreaming about.  He could remember it had to do with his mother.<br/>
He closed his eyes and tried to concentrate on her visage.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Grogg, wake up,&quot; she said that in that dreamy voice only an orc mother<br/>
could have. To Grogg it sounded like a cross between a crystal mountain<br/>
stream trickling through the rocks and a saw blade chopping wood. He liked<br/>
his mother&#39;s voice.  It felt very comforting to him.  &quot;Wake up, Grogg,&quot; she<br/>
said again.  &quot;Today is a very special day!&quot;<br/>
 Ah, yes, today.  The day Grogg would be sent to the orc warriors&#39; training<br/>
camp. As with most young orcs his age, he would be sent to the training camp<br/>
to learn the ways of survival and warfare, to one day protect the dear orc<br/>
lands from the trampling footsteps of the intruders.  Grogg had learned in<br/>
school that the orc territory used to be vast and covered much of Norrath,<br/>
but with the invasion of humans and elves and their elite weapons, the orc<br/>
numbers had been cut back drastically; and now the orcs were struggling to<br/>
survive in ramshackle camps with what meager possessions they could loot<br/>
from the bodies of their victims.  Grogg&#39;s father had been an orc warrior.<br/>
A very proud man, and Grogg respected his father, loved him as only an orc<br/>
child could.  But, unfortunately, his father had been slain by the hand of<br/>
the invaders several moons ago.  Grogg vowed that one day he would avenge<br/>
his father&#39;s death.  Orcs hold a very strong bond for their kin.<br/>
 &quot;Time to wake up, Grogg,&quot; his mother called again.  He realized he had<br/>
almost drifted back to sleep.  Slowly, he crawled out of his straw mat on<br/>
the floor and stood up.  He stretched a full stretch, then donned his green<br/>
training tunic that would carry him to the waiting orc training camp.  He<br/>
made his way into the main section of his tent-home where his mother was<br/>
placing a small wooden bowl of bat wing crunchies cereal on the old oak<br/>
table.  Grogg did not speak.  His mother was cheery.  She knew it was an<br/>
important day for her son.  She let him eat in silence though while she<br/>
tidied up the tent and soaked the cooking pots in already dirty water.<br/>
 Shortly after breakfast, there was a rapping on the tent frame.  &quot;Hail!&quot;<br/>
came the call.  &quot;Come in!&quot; his mother responded still cheery. The tent flap<br/>
opened and Grogg watched in awe as the biggest orc he&#39;d ever seen in his<br/>
life walked in.  He was twice as wide as Grogg was from shoulder to<br/>
shoulder, and stood at least twice as high.  His armor was shiny gold and<br/>
quite impressive.  Around his waist he wore a large belt decorated in<br/>
various motifs and lined with numerous slashes.  He was a giant of an orc;<br/>
the likes of which Grogg had never seen.<br/>
 &quot;I am Legionnaire Gor, assistant headmaster at the Orc Training Facility,&quot;<br/>
he began in a booming voice.  &quot;I am here for Grogg.&quot;<br/>
 Grogg shyly stood up.  He barely came up to the man&#39;s belt.  His mother<br/>
stood behind him.  She placed a comforting hand on Grogg&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;Yes,<br/>
I&#39;m very proud of Grogg,&quot; she said with that saw blade trickling water<br/>
voice.  &quot;I am sure he&#39;ll make a very fine warrior some day, like his father<br/>
was.&quot;<br/>
 The Legionnaire looked down on Grogg.  &quot;Yes, looks stout for his age.  I<br/>
bet your father was a fine warrior,&quot; he said, kneeling down to be eye to eye<br/>
with Grogg.  Then he said, in a quieter voice, &quot;Son, you understand these<br/>
are tough times we live in, right?  Well, being an orc warrior is not easy.<br/>
To tell the truth, countless have died, but we do what we can.  There&#39;s no<br/>
shame to die in combat.  Many orcs consider it the greatest honor to die<br/>
while protecting their homelands.  Now if you&#39;re strong of arm and strong of<br/>
will, then I know that you too can be the great warrior your father once<br/>
was.  So what do you say?  Would you like to be an orc warrior?&quot;<br/>
 Grogg was near paralyzed.  It was all too much to take in at once.  He<br/>
could not find his voice, but he knew he wanted it more than anything else.<br/>
Slowly, he shook his head.   &quot;Very well, then!&quot; said Gor regaining his full<br/>
composure.  &quot;If you have your things packed then we&#39;ll be off.  We have a<br/>
long day ahead.&quot;<br/>
 Grogg had already packed what little possessions he owned.  His mother<br/>
handed him the rucksack.  He looked at her still unable to speak.  The tent<br/>
was silent now.  Gor let out a small cough recognizing the situation.  &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>
just step outside and check the horses while you say goodbye to your<br/>
 mother,&quot; he said.   With that, he turned on his boot heel and promptly<br/>
exited.<br/>
 His mother was the first to speak.  &quot;I&#39;m proud of you, Grogg,&quot; she said.<br/>
Her voice was more water than saw blade now.  &quot;And I know you&#39;ll make our<br/>
family proud.  Your father would definitely be proud.  I want you to write<br/>
as often as you can.  I will miss you, you know that.&quot;  Grogg felt tears in<br/>
his eyes.  He suddenly hugged his mother very tightly.  He let the tears<br/>
flow as she comforted him.  He did not want to let go.  But out of the<br/>
corner of his eye he saw Gor standing in the entrance.  &quot;We must go now,<br/>
Grogg.  Daylight moves fast on Norrath.&quot;<br/>
 &quot;Goodbye, Grogg,&quot; his mother said finally.  He knew inside she must be<br/>
feeling terrified, but she was trying to remain strong to not show it.<br/>
Grogg still couldn&#39;t speak.<br/>
<br/>
 The bell had rung again.  &quot;Grogg, wake up!&quot;  He heard the even harsher<br/>
voice of his drill instructor calling him.  &quot;March time!  Out of that bed,<br/>
warrior!&quot;<br/>
 &quot;I wish I had said something,&quot; Grogg muttered under his breath.<br/>
 &quot;Today&#39;s a special day, warrior!&quot; ranted the drill instructor.  &quot;You wouldn<br/>
&#39;t want to be late would you?&quot;<br/>
 Suddenly it came back to Grogg.  Today was a special day.  Today was the<br/>
day he would be leaving orc training camp.  Grogg was graduating.  He would<br/>
be a full-fledged warrior now and receive his first assignment.  As the<br/>
realization hit him, he suddenly jumped out of his sleeping sack and donned<br/>
his best training tunic.  It was gold like Gor&#39;s armor had been, but not as<br/>
fancy.  &quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; said Grogg.<br/>
<br/>
 The ceremony had been a short one, though it had been festively decorated.<br/>
Alongside Grogg, his other training mates had also been graduated.  They<br/>
each had to pass a podium and shake hands with the High Chief as they<br/>
received their diplomas.  As Grogg stood on the platform he searched the<br/>
audience for his mother but he could not find her.  When he heard his name<br/>
called he stood as straight as possible.  The High Chief said,<br/>
&quot;Congratulations, Grogg! You are awarded the honored Deathfist Belt.  Wear<br/>
it in pride, and may you make many slashes in it!&quot;<br/>
 It had been explained that the Deathfist Belt was given to new graduates of<br/>
the orc training camp, and they would wear them through the rest of their<br/>
service in the orc legion.  The slashes represented how many invaders they<br/>
had slain in combat.  Grogg wondered whatever happened to his father&#39;s belt.<br/>
 As he stepped off the platform, one of the senior officers pulled him aside<br/>
by the shoulder.  &quot;Orc Chief wants to see you pronto,&quot; said the officer.<br/>
Grogg wondered what it was about.  He made his way to the High Chief&#39;s<br/>
office and knocked on the door.<br/>
 &quot;Come in, Grogg,&quot; said the Chief.  His voice was also booming like Gor&#39;s<br/>
had been.  It sounded more like bones crunching bones though.<br/>
 &quot;I have some bad news, Grogg.&quot;  The Chief stood with his back toward him.<br/>
He looked out a window at the remnants of the ceremony.  &quot;I just received<br/>
word that your mother has been slain.&quot;  He turned around to face Grogg, but<br/>
said nothing further.<br/>
 &quot;When?&quot; asked Grogg.<br/>
 &quot;Last night.  The invaders came through.  We had armies stationed in that<br/>
area, but they were overpowered.  An entire platoon was slaughtered.  These<br/>
times are bad for orcs.  The intruders are getting smarter.  Getting better<br/>
equipment.  It&#39;s hard for us to maintain an edge.&quot;<br/>
 &quot;And my mother?&quot;<br/>
 &quot;She has been buried alongside the other orcs.  A marker has been placed.<br/>
You will be allowed to return there before reporting to your first<br/>
assignment. &quot;<br/>
 &quot;Thank you, Sir,&quot; said Grogg.<br/>
 &quot;And, Grogg, on a more personal note, I am sorry.  I know you loved your<br/>
mother.  And for what it&#39;s worth, I knew your father when he trained here.<br/>
He was a good orc and a brilliant warrior.  I was also sad to hear of his<br/>
death.  I am sorry, Grogg.&quot;<br/>
 &quot;And what of my father&#39;s belt?&quot; asked Grogg.  &quot;What happened to it?&quot;<br/>
 &quot;Who knows?&quot; replied the Chief.  &quot;Looted perhaps. These scoundrels are<br/>
notorious looters.&quot;<br/>
 Grogg was silent.  The Chief noted this.  &quot;You can go,&quot; he said.  Grogg<br/>
turned on his heel as Gor had once done and slowly walked out.<br/>
<br/>
 He had visited his mother&#39;s grave.  He placed some flowers on it. When he<br/>
tried to find the words to say a small prayer, all he could think of was &quot;I<br/>
wish I had said something.&quot;  Then Grogg cried quietly until the tears had<br/>
run out.  Calmly, he picked up his sword and headed off to his first<br/>
assignment.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;You will be stationed in the Commonlands,&quot; the High Chief had said.  &quot;I<br/>
know you had lived around that area, and I know it&#39;s close to your mother&#39;s<br/>
grave.  You will be promoted to the rank of Centurion.  There are<br/>
weaponsmiths there who can help you, and if you need spiritual guidance due<br/>
to the loss of your parents, there is also an orc oracle.  Plus I have<br/>
assigned some of my high chiefs to periodically check on the camp.  I think<br/>
you should like it.<br/>
 If you survive your tour of duty there, you will be sent to the High Pass<br/>
zone.  Many good orcs are there to lead your way.  However, that&#39;s a very<br/>
dangerous area as the High Pass Citizens are constantly at war with us.  The<br/>
intruders make their way into the zone to buy and sell their goods also.  Be<br/>
safe and cautious, young Grogg.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Grogg reported to the Commons.  He reported to the High Chief in charge, a<br/>
very grim man with no sense of humor.   He was also a man of few words.  All<br/>
he said was &quot;Welcome to Orc Station One.  I hope your survive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The day was quiet.  There were not many travelers in zone.  The orcs went<br/>
about their business making their weapons and practicing their skills.  It<br/>
was about near dusk when the alarm was sounded.  Instantly, orcs began<br/>
shouting and running around him.  Grogg responded slowly.  But he grabbed<br/>
his sword, tightened his Deathfist belt which had begun to show some newly<br/>
made slashes, and ran along with the others toward the melee.  It was a<br/>
small group of invaders - only six of them, but they looked very decked out<br/>
in high quality armor and yielding shiny expensive looking weapons.  Grogg<br/>
knew it was going to be a hard battle.  He took a deep breath and rushed<br/>
into combat with his battle cry:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Orc stomp, Orc kill! Orc weapons, blood spill!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He focused on the nearest to him, slashing away as fast as he could. The<br/>
intruder was a tough opponent, an equal match.  Grogg wondered if this was<br/>
how his father felt just before he was slain.  A strange sort of battle calm<br/>
came over him then, and even though he slashed away on reflex, he noticed<br/>
the sky was turning a dark shade of gray.  He could tell it was about to<br/>
rain.  The fog moved in fast.  His mind was aware that he was feeling pain.<br/>
He looked down and noticed blood was seeping through his golden breastplate.<br/>
He stared at his opponent, not wanting to realize the truth.  Grogg was<br/>
about to die.<br/>
With one mighty stroke of his sword he gave a final effort.  The blade fell<br/>
short as he saw the huge two-handed sword of his opponent came crashing down<br/>
on his armor.  Grogg fell over.  He looked up at his opponent.  He thought<br/>
of his mother and father.  &quot;I&#39;m coming to join you, father,&quot; Grogg thought.<br/>
&quot;MY COMRADES WILL AVENGE MY DEATH!&quot; he shouted, but it was no use.  The last<br/>
thing he saw before his eyes closed permanently was that of his opponent<br/>
stripping away his beloved Deathfist slashed belt.<br/>
<br/>
