<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have played with both cards and I thought the 
Geforce 4 Ti made things look better than the MX. The 4 MX seems to basically be 
a 2 MX, just faster and more memory. I may take back my MX and get the Ti, the 
day that I spent with that card was the most enjoyable day I ever spent in EQ.
