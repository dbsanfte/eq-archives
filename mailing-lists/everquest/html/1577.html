Verant says the investigations on compromised<br>accounts take away too much time for the GMs to do customer support, so now<br>they are just going to ban all accounts that are compromised.. That&#39;s what I<br>call really f-in BAD customer support.. It&#39;s like an insurance.. Knowing<br>that if someone steals your car, or breaks into it and steal your brand new<br>Lodizal Shell Stereo, the insurance company will help you out and cough up a<br>new one for you.. Verant sux! Maybe they could charge a fee like the<br>insurance companies do, from people whos accounts have been compromised in<br>order to investigate and rectify the situation, but BAN THEM? That is SO<br>F-IN WRONG!<br><br>- Avron K&#39;Nighit - Paladin 48<br>- Dunbar Keglifter - Cleric 59<br>- Meron Shadowdale - Rogue 53<br><br><br>Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br><br><br>Your use of Yahoo!
