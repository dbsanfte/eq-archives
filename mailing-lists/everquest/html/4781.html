punctuation.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I&#39;m not a grammar-nazi, but if someone tries to maintain that<br/>
they can do something then make several errors in doing it I feel<br/>
obliged to point them out. We learn from our mistakes it is true, but<br/>
only once they are pointed out.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you and your friends enjoy EQ Lori, it is a great game, and if<br/>
they are fine with the way that you type then that&#39;s cool, but it is<br/>
worth learning the standards of the rest of society too so that when you<br/>
do need to communicate with people outside your peers you can do so with<br/>
ease.<br/>
