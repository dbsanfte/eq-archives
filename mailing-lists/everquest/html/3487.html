<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575429124">I am 49, and married to a fabulous woman who cannot fathom EQ. She, <br/>
however, is an email junkie, and so not opposed to the machine which <br/>
sucks away my life. Our addictions are different, yet have common <br/>
ground.<br/>
<br/>
Of my three children only one has grown to be a gamer. He and I play <br/>
in shifts, making room for my wife to check her email once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
I find my addiction to be satisfying, affordable, and much healthier <br/>
than smoking. Since I cannot drink much and play EQ, I need not fear <br/>
demon alcohol. My primary addiction keeps me safe from other things.<br/>
<br/>
It will be eight years until I can actually retire. That will be two <br/>
systems from now, probably at the beginning of EQ3.<br/>
<br/>
By then I will be able to move someplace very affordable, and order <br/>
all that life requires over the intrenet. I will be fully involved in <br/>
EQ3, and never have to face real life again.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps by EQ4 there will be total body interface systems. With <br/>
automatic hydration systems and drip-feed nutrition. <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone say &quot;Lawnmower Man?&quot;<br/>
