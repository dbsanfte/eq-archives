<div id="ygrps-yiv-508143357">No Wulfric, you are not the only naysayer. I just haven&#39;t had a chance<br/>
to reply yet. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Like you I do not believe that SOE will get rid of their biggest cash<br/>
cow, (And still is) I still meet people on a weekly basis (average of at<br/>
least 10) who are brand new to the game. (EQ1 +/- any scam artists in<br/>
that bunch)<br/>
<br/>
EQ1 is still alive and strong, there are no plans for EQ1 to &quot;catch up&quot;<br/>
with EQ2, thats up to you the individual player to use your imagination<br/>
and &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; so to speak when you make the switch to EQ2.<br/>
 From the start SOE said that EQ2 is a complete change from EQ1. Also<br/>
think of it this way, do music groups have the same songs on every<br/>
album? No. They are always changing to appeal to the masses. If they put<br/>
the same songs on every album you would eventually get bored with it and<br/>
every time you hear them on the radio it would be basically the same<br/>
song but with different words.<br/>
<br/>
EQ2 is a &quot;sequel&quot; to EQ1 just as &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a &quot;sequel&quot; to<br/>
&quot;The Matrix&quot;. I&#39;m sure that SOE would like everyone to move over to EQ2<br/>
but they know and accept the fact that not everyone has a powerful<br/>
enough computer to run EQ2. I don&#39;t. Plus I have so many things to do in<br/>
EQ1 first before I move on to another game. Another thing to consider, I<br/>
have met players who have been in the game for 5 years or more! Imagine<br/>
the cash SOE has made off these people!<br/>
<br/>
There will always be new games on the market. Look at WoW, The Matrix,<br/>
the new D&D game coming out. and one I saw that just looks awesome<br/>
Lineage II, The graphics are amazing. Honestly if I &quot;had&quot; to switch,<br/>
thats the one I would go to. Also if you look at MMORPG.com they list<br/>
Guild Wars as the top game right now plus they list all the MMORPG games<br/>
out there. (There are more than you think!) So take all those into<br/>
consideration and then look at how well EQ1 has done compared to all of<br/>
those others out there. EQ1 is still the giant and will always be a<br/>
major contender.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents<br/>

Well I suppose someone had to step up and be the naysayer in the group.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I agree with most of this or not.  I&#39;ve always said that <br/>
as long as EQ is around I&#39;ll keep playing it.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;ll just have to wait and see what happens.<br/>

<br/>
  Nah, EQ1 has a remaining life of maybe 2 more years, but that is<br/>
  stretching it a bit.  Even as SOEs major flagship game, SOE is seeing<br/>
  the darkness at the end of the tunnel.  They will be spending more<br/>
  money to maintain the game than they are bringing in with<br/>
  subscriptions dropping more and more each month.  I think SOE &quot;may&quot;<br/>
  try to revitilize EQ by releasing a completely new graphics engine<br/>
  and serious upgrade for the game, but this would be optional and only<br/>
  be window dressing since there is not too much they can do with the<br/>
  backend servers without a complete game overhaul, which they just are<br/>
  not going to do.  EQ2 was a serious disapointment to them, as the<br/>
  players were already use to EQ1 and the social structure there.  It<br/>
  does sadden me a bit that EQ will come to a close, but we all knew it<br/>
  would happen eventually.  I doubt SOE will ever cancel EQ completely<br/>
  (at least not for another 5 or so years), but I would imagine the day<br/>
  when new expansion are no longer released, patches are no longer<br/>
  made, and maybe one or two servers are all that are left is not too<br/>
  far around the corner.... like I said, maybe 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
  I doubt there will ever be another game that has the same appeal and<br/>
  drive that SOE captured with EQ1... however I think we might find<br/>
  that another game may come close only after SOE &quot;pulls the plug&quot; on<br/>
  EQ1 and forces everyone to find another game.  We may see a game in<br/>
  the future released from SOE along the same genre of EverQuest, but<br/>
  with a completely different story line and perhaps even the same<br/>
  stayability of EverQuest, but I rather doubt it.  I think SOE will<br/>
  end up making their bread and butter with shoot-offs of the Star Wars<br/>
  Universe and maybe some other games like they offer on the station<br/>
  website (jeopardy, wheel of fortune, etc), while another game company<br/>
  with the same spirit that SOE had long ago steps up to take the<br/>
  lead.  I would say the next big game will be Vanguard : Saga of<br/>
  Heros.  I think that Brad and Jeff have both learned a lot from their<br/>
  experience helping shape EverQuest, and Microsoft (one of the biggest<br/>
  backers of Sigil) has learned from its mistakes in the online game<br/>
  field and won&#39;t make the same mistakes again.  SOE has started<br/>
  loosing its grip on the market and Microsoft has a habit of stepping<br/>
  in and taking over when something like that happens.  I mean look at<br/>
  Nintendo, Sega, and even Sony.  They started slipping in the console<br/>
  game industry and Microsoft stepped in with the X-Box and dominated<br/>
  the market by throwing money at the market till they owned it.  Now<br/>
  the best graphics for console games out there are on X-Box, even if<br/>
  content is still split evenly but leaning more towards X-Box as time<br/>
  goes on.<br/>

  &gt; Oh cool!!<br/>
  &gt; I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though. Plus EQ2<br/>
  could be considered a parrallel universe.<br/>
  &gt; I didn&#39;t know Luclin had exploded in EQ2. Did they say the story<br/>
  behind why? What happened to the poor Vah Shir?<br/>
  &gt; I imagine in 25 years the game interfaces will be much more<br/>
  advanced. Maybe there will be EQ 1.5 or 1.9A or something.  :-D<br/>

  &gt; &gt;Check this out.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;72 minutes real time = 1 day game time<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;You can check it if you want, I haven&#39;t verified it.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;Soooooooo......<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;72 X 365 = 26280 minutes real time<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;26280 /  60 =  438 hours<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;438  /  24 =  18.25 days<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;18.25 days real time = 1 year on Norrath<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;or roughly two and a half weeks.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;Current game date as of this writing is March 11, 3200.  EQ2 is<br/>
  supposed to take place 500 years in Norrath&#39;s future.  Luclin<br/>
  explodes, Kunark is nowhere to be found.  So how long will it take<br/>
  before EQ1 catches up with EQ2??<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;18.25 X 500 = 9125  days real time<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;9125  /  365  =  25 years!!!<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;So if you play EverQuest for 25 years, you will reach the year<br/>
  3700 game time in which case you should see the moon explode and<br/>
  you&#39;ll know what happened to Kunark.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;Cool huh?<br/>
