<div id="ygrps-yiv-601339229"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Thank you for posting this. I went to check them out and you know I have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to say I was a little dissapointed in the guides. A lot of the information<br/>
that they contain can be found at almost any EQ related website! It&#39;s<br/>
basically that I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay for any of these guides, it&#39;s really<br/>
not worth the money. The only thing I&#39;m truly interested in is making money.<br/>
Man it sucks trying to get some decent armor when you have no money. I&#39;ve<br/>
wondered about the &quot;make Plat at any level&quot; guides and I figured that you<br/>
would still need to group or partner at some point.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Either way I&#39;m having fun just going along and doing things the old<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fashioned way. I do suggest going and getting these guides because there<br/>
were a few things in there that was nice to know about but for any player,<br/>
especially noobs, I suggest doing it the old fashioned way and go out there<br/>
and take the lumps and partner with some others. It&#39;s funner and you&#39;ll feel<br/>
better knowing that you did it on your own.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I got some good info about Unrest so I think I may go and try it out this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>week.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you have Luclin you can do what I did, run to Dawnshroud and then run<br/>
along the wall as high as you can to reach Maidens Eye. Confirm there is no<br/>
train on the inside or wait until a train has gone, then zone in and see if<br/>
there are any corpses at zone to loot. :-)<br/>
I got a goranga idol and small brick of acrylia. :-) Those sell for a decent<br/>
price. As long as you avoid mobs you&#39;re ok.<br/>
luv,<br/>
