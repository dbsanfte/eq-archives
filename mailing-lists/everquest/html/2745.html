<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555219147">Congrats on the shawl progress. I just came across those a while back <br/>
in my research for mid-level wish list items. Not ready yet, but I <br/>
think the shawls makes a cool quest series. Lot of work. Good luck on <br/>
the rest of them.<br/>

&gt; I really like to find the lvl 1s who just logged in and don&#39;t know <br/>
where<br/>
&gt; their guild is. I will take them to their guild, introduce them to <br/>
their<br/>
&gt; guildmaster and maybe give them some patchwork armor. I have been <br/>
known to<br/>
&gt; give tours of Kelethin to new players or visitors to the area. And <br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; always more than happy to give peole details to quests so they can <br/>
make xp.<br/>

&gt; Speaking of quests, I just finished my 3rd shawl queast (in Thurg) <br/>
and am<br/>
&gt; starting on the 4th. :-)<br/>
&gt; Gonna go play that now. :-)<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
