&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This is an odd request, but I am looking for some Everquest <br/>
&gt; players that <br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t mind being interviewed either by IM, phone, or if <br/>
&gt; practical in person. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; am a graduate student at the Institute of Design at Illinois <br/>
&gt; Institute of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Technology in Chicago. For one of my classes, entitled Observing <br/>
&gt; Users, we <br/>
&gt; &gt; have to study a product and its users. Our group chose Everquest <br/>
&gt; because we <br/>
&gt; &gt; think that it is very interesting and complex. As a retired online <br/>
&gt; gamer I know <br/>
&gt; &gt; how much fun and involving the games can be. In fact, I am very <br/>
&gt; tempted to <br/>
&gt; &gt; jump into Everquest, but I am worried that I may lose <br/>
&gt; concentration on my <br/>
&gt; &gt; studies. If anyone is willing to devote a little of their time to <br/>
&gt; helping us out we <br/>
&gt; &gt; would really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are poor grad <br/>
&gt; students and will <br/>
&gt; &gt; not be able to compensate anyone who helps us out, but we will <br/>
&gt; very very <br/>
&gt; &gt; thankful. Thanks<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
