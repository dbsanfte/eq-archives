<div id="ygrps-yiv-402571070">What server are you on on WoW?<br/>
I&#39;ve got EQ, SW:G, and WoW. I&#39;m on Alleria realm. I don&#39;t play SW:G much and don&#39;t play EQ as much as I used to bc its so hard for me to get groups now. With my lag I&#39;m not as efficient a healer as I need to be to get good groups and get xp.<br/>
luv,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Wow Kwasi, you and I been playing about same length of time.  I started in May 2001just after Kunark expansion pack.  I had to buy EQ classic and Ruins of Kunark separately since at that point nothing was offered as a pack.  I have a copy of EverQuest Trilogy around here that has never been opened which I thought about using to start a 3rd account.  But I just cant afford it, what with an EQ2 account, and a WOW account!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway....  no newb here I guess!<br/>

&gt;  I been playing since EQ since Aug of 2001 I think that was not long after Velious came out not sure but on my main account I got every expansion since.  With my other accounts i started out with Trilogy and for my druids account I got Platinum and then each expansion individually<br/>
