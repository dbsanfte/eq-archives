<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336223971">Also, if you have good faction with the gypsies in NK you can turn the<br/>
lightstone and greater lightstone in to one of the gypsies for faction and<br/>
xp. You get a compendium for the greater and it sells to merchants for about<br/>
8 to 9pp. The regular lightstones you get a book for and it sells ok.<br/>
Also, I think either lightstones or greater lightstones are used in some<br/>
tradeskills. I think tailoring for Wu&#39;s Fighting gear.<br/>

If you go to East Commons and kill the Willowisps they drop a lightstone or<br/>
greater lightstone as well as a little coin. Don&#39;t put it in a backpack<br/>
leave it in one of your inventory slots and it will improve your vision. I<br/>
ve had one on my beastlord now since level 4 and it hasn&#39;t burned out yet.<br/>
Oh and the greater lightstones sell for about 6pp depending on your charisma<br/>
