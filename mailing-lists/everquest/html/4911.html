<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423883736">I think that craft items should be more beneficial and thus more<br/>
valuable. At present, there is little motivation to craft unless you<br/>
have a gaming predilection to do things like that. At present, by the<br/>
time you have leveled up enough to aquire materials, plus leveled your<br/>
crafting, the items you make aren&#39;t as good as what you can hunt or buy. <br/>
<br/>
A real in-game economy would add to the fun. Especially if it would be<br/>
good even for casual gamers. I can&#39;t always find the time to play<br/>
enough to level and aquire stuff in ways which seem economical. There<br/>
should be provision for a good gaming experience even for very casual<br/>
gamers. <br/>

&gt; Ok, we know they are adding vases, coffins, and chests that can be<br/>
opened or<br/>
&gt; smashed into the game with Lost Dungeons of Norrath, but are there<br/>
any other<br/>
&gt; features you would like to see added to Everquest?<br/>
&gt; Or, if you could go back in time and change something about<br/>
Everquest during<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s creation to have certain features, what would you have done<br/>
&gt; differently?<br/>
&gt; Feel free to go into detail if you want. :-)<br/>
