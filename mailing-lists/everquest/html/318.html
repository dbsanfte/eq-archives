<div id="ygrps-yiv-575826180">Thats not really a new command .. its been avaliable since the final beta.<br/>
Comes in handy when you want to loot your corpse in a dangerous area.  Find<br/>
someone to make you invisible and use the /corpse command over and over,<br/>
till you can drag it to a safe area allowing you to loot it safely.<br/>
<br/>
The only other command that i can think of is the /pet sit down command.  I<br/>
never found it in the book for some reason. ( maybe its just me ) That<br/>
command lets you place your pet in a spot where it will just rest.  It will<br/>
not attack other creatures around you unless you are attacked.  Rememeber to<br/>
tell it to follow you when you are ready to go, or it will just sit there..<br/>
hehe<br/>

I have only been playing EQ for a few weeks and <br/>
have found a /command that is not in the <br/>
text files that come with the game.<br/>
<br/>
/corpse: <br/>
summons your corpse from a few yards away.<br/>
This is useful if your corpse is underneath the<br/>
NPC/creature that killed you, or if you want to <br/>
loot yourself in a less high traffic area.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone out there that can tell me more <br/>
commands that are not in the list?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
