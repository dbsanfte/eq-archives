<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853940639"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I was looking at writeups on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.crgaming.com/">http://eq.crgaming.com/</a> and came across<br/>
&gt; a thing called Disciplines.  But I have not discovered how to use<br/>
&gt; these.  Is this old info?  If not how do I get the Disciplines?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Before the disciplines were released there were only 4 that were available <br/>
to all classes, however the pure melee classes were having problems keeping <br/>
up with hybrid classes in aggro managment and damage as the hybrid classes <br/>
could use spells to augment their fighting.  I was playing before them and <br/>
remember when we wanted someone to tank who could hold aggro we&#39;d look for a <br/>
paladin or shadow knight since warriors would have problems keeping aggro <br/>
with all the casters nuking.  Sony added the disciplines as a way to boost <br/>
the melees abilities so they could compete with the hybrids.  Adding taunts <br/>
and health regen discs are availible to even level 10 melees while the real <br/>
powerhouse discs start in the 50s.  The introduction of this system also <br/>
changed how to activate the disciplines.  Before you automatically got them <br/>
at the right level, butnow you have to buy the tomes and hand them to your <br/>
trainer to get the skill.  The original 4 are only 2 copper each but the <br/>
newer ones cost a lot more.</div>
