Are you running both on the same comp. (i.e. eqwin)?  If so, make 2 entirely<br/>
seperate eq directories on your HD and run one from each.  I have been doing<br/>
this quite succesfully for a while now.  Set the sound off on the secondary<br/>
one.  Set ALL extra graphics off on the 2nd one also. Fenudwin</div>
