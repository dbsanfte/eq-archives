<div id="ygrps-yiv-177982707"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Go to Frontier Mountains, in Kunark, and get into a Giant Fort group.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; exp, nice loot. Druids are always in demand -- &quot;sow please.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. You&#39;ll be lucky if you get a &quot;please&quot;. I&#39;ve found people just say &quot;can<br/>
I have sow&quot;. (now that my druid is able to sow). I had one guy come up and<br/>
bug me when I was turning in CB belts in Kaladim yesterday. He said &quot;can I<br/>
have sow.&quot; I said &quot;I can&#39;t cast that spell indoors&quot;. guy says &quot;What are you<br/>
giving him?&quot; me: &quot;Crushbone belts&quot; guy &quot;Can I have sow.&quot;<br/>
So I tried to cast it on him just to show it wouldn&#39;t work. then I told him<br/>
the message. I was just about to camp. He&#39;s like &quot;ok. tell me when you&#39;re<br/>
leaving so you can sow me.&quot;<br/>
I was thinking &quot;would it kill the person to ask if I could go out and sow<br/>
him? or to say please?&quot; That has been bothering me lately. Lack of manners.<br/>
I&#39;ve been casting sow on people before they can ask for it lately. they hail<br/>
me and I cast it. Just so I won&#39;t have to be angry if they don&#39;t say please.<br/>
Most of them say thanks at least.<br/>
anyhoo, I just camped right there and never said another word to the person.<br/>
I was too tired to deal with it.<br/>
luv,<br/>
