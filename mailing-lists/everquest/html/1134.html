<div id="ygrps-yiv-427601762">well, my problem was not that I ran to the guard but that either a guard<br/>
wandered by or the mob I was fighting ran to the guards to get away from me.<br/>
it was especially bad with dwarf bandits in ButcherBlock.<br/>
It made no sense to me why the mobs would run to an enemy NPC. It was like<br/>
they did it just to spite me bc they knew I wouldn&#39;t get the xp.<br/>
