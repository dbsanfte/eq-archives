<div id="ygrps-yiv-121367956">If you are a human monk, then use the boats between efp and bb to <br/>
raise skill.  Just keep jumping off the raised part of the boat.  I <br/>
raised safe fall this way on two chars back when the boats were the <br/>
only free ride between continents.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I&#39;m new to this group and to playing EQ.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My questions may be redundant to those asked by others here or even <br/>
&gt; off the wall but her goes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does any one use begging?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have built mine to 23 (not real hi I know but the character is <br/>
only <br/>
&gt; 9th level) so far all it has done is get me 2 copper and attacked <br/>
&gt; twice.  Not good odds (one attack per copper).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why do I have direction sense?  And why would you buy a compass?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a compass on my screen.  I already know what direction I am <br/>
&gt; facing.  My direction sense is at 200 and it still only works about <br/>
&gt; 60% of the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a monk, how do I improve my safe fall skill without spending all <br/>
&gt; my points on it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I keep jumping off tall things and taking damage but no improvement.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why are all the characters white?  What if I want to play a black <br/>
&gt; person?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well that&#39;s about it for now.  I look foreword (because my eyes are <br/>
&gt; in the front of my head :P ) to your answers.<br/>
