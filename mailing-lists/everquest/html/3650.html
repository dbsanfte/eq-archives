<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001869559">Muse at EQ Atlas makes the best maps I&#39;ve seen.  I have several <br/>
notebooks full of them.  I doubt I&#39;ll buy Sony&#39;s version as I&#39;ve <br/>
heard it&#39;s not as detailed or accurate.  Even if you buy it you&#39;ll <br/>
still need EQ Atlas for those details.<br/>
<br/>
I also share many peoples disappointment in the name.  EQ Atlas is <br/>
THE place to get maps.  Sony had many choices for names, and they <br/>
knew how popular EQ Atlas is, so it seems they wanted to cash in on <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t buy it, it will be an excellent resource.  Just <br/>
remember Muse when you need the real thing!<br/>

&gt; I will probably buy the forthcoming atlas, once it is out. It will <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; cheaper than printing up the rest of the maps I don&#39;t have, since I <br/>
&gt; have been only printing maps as I need them. Plus, we ran out of <br/>
ink <br/>
&gt; and nobody in my household wants to be the one to spring for the <br/>
new <br/>
&gt; ink. Probably because they know a large number of maps will be <br/>
&gt; printed as soon as the ink is loaded. ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I would really like is to have eq in a window, with a second <br/>
&gt; monitor to hold my data; maps, charts, lists, and recipes. I know <br/>
&gt; there is a hack to allow this, but I would prefer a sanctioned <br/>
&gt; window. Plus I don&#39;t have the horsepower on this system to carry <br/>
such <br/>
&gt; a load. My game would suffer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Twenty bucks for the atlas sounds cheaper all round.<br/>
