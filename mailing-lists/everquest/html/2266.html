<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921462404">One particular experience comes to mind. A lvl 14 wood elf needed to <br/>
get back home, but was short on cash. I had just ported into the area <br/>
where he approached me. Just before that I had gotten a very nice <br/>
reward for a few minutes of tracking. I gave the guy a free ride <br/>
home. When I arrived in BB I got a tell from someone offering 100pp <br/>
for a ride. I took the job. A job I would not have gotten had I not <br/>
felt generous after someone else had been generous to me. Sure, I <br/>
sometimes get stiffed and sometimes get something I can&#39;t use as a <br/>
tip, but for the most part I think I have been well rewarded. For me <br/>
it is in character and adds to the game.<br/>

&gt; I considered it myself... :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Now that I can port, I have decided to do so without<br/>
&gt; &gt;thought of reward. Oh, of course I will go quite a<br/>
&gt; &gt;bit out of my way for an offer of good money, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt;have found giving a port to someone unable to give<br/>
&gt; &gt;much in return seems to add to the game in other ways<br/>
&gt; &gt;than money. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m still pondering exactly how I feel about group<br/>
&gt; ports. I don&#39;t think I could ever feel right about<br/>
&gt; running around auctioning &quot;Porting to NK, BB, SF, Tox<br/>
&gt; and WC for 50pp per seat&quot;, but I do personally think<br/>
&gt; that a small donation is the right thing when<br/>
&gt; recieving a port. (not that i&#39;d ever actively demand<br/>
&gt; one) As someone who&#39;s probably spent a couple hundred<br/>
&gt; plat on ports over the last while, I just see the<br/>
&gt; standard 10pp donation is a small way of saying<br/>
&gt; &quot;thanks for your time&quot;. Again, not required, but a<br/>
&gt; nice gesture. It&#39;s most certainly a larger commitment<br/>
&gt; than SoW... (I still can&#39;t feel right about taking<br/>
&gt; donations for a SoW though, the guy with the HQ Bear<br/>
&gt; Pelt was rather persistant, but I usually stubbornly<br/>
&gt; refuse &#39;em :)<br/>
