<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669615922">I have been working on this quest too. The ghouls were easy compared <br/>
to the DE, can&#39;t find him anywhere. I am on the Torv server and I <br/>
only found 3 ghouls up at a time. Got tired of the respawn time, so <br/>
went back the next day and they were on track. Might just have been <br/>
someone killing them the day you were hunting them.<br/>

&gt; Those ghouls do spawn, they were not part of the<br/>
&gt; event.<br/>
&gt; They are not a common POP though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Try again, let us know how you make out.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;      I am having a lot of trouble completing a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; druid/cleric quest that starts in Felwithe.  It is<br/>
&gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Initiate of Tunare neckpiece, that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; eventually<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lead me to getting a neck piece that has a mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; free<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; root effect.  I am having problems getting the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rancerous Ghouls to spawn in Lesser Faydark.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; done all day (real time) camps running around<br/>
&gt; &gt; killing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; undead, and tracking, but can&#39;t seem to get them<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spawn.  Any ideas?<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure that they spawn anymore... I think they<br/>
&gt; &gt; were only there<br/>
&gt; &gt; fore a couple of weeks for a special &#39;event&#39; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; couple of years ago, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the quest involving them dates to that event too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I may be wrong, but I don&#39;t think that quest works<br/>
&gt; &gt; anymore.<br/>
