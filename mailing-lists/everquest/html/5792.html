 </span></blockquote>My advice is to play Everquest. I have played for two years or so <br/>
now and I love the game. I had friends who played, and i did not <br/>
understand how or why they could spend so much time and effort <br/>
playing an online game. They all responded...&quot;Play it for a month <br/>
and you will understand&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I did, and it didnt take me a month to understand, it took me a few <br/>
days. <br/>
<br/>
The game overall is..fun. It allows you to &quot;pretend&quot; to be someone <br/>
you aren&#39;t, who you want to be, and within certain guidelines, <br/>
behave how you want to be. There are those heavy-duty &quot;role-players&quot; <br/>
and those who are not. I am in between I guess. I have 2 accounts <br/>
(16 toons)and with some I roleplay and others I just play.<br/>
<br/>
I have made alot of friends on EQ, and alot of enemies too ( mostly <br/>
folks who do not appreciate the true evil-nature of the Dark-Elf or <br/>
the snobbyness of the High-Elf.) Most importantly though, I have met <br/>
the love of my life on EQ and know of others who have done so as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
EQ is a thinking game. There is as much knowledge, research, and <br/>
studying to EQ as there is in most peoples real lives. There are web-<br/>
sites who are dedicated to Everquest, many that I frequent <br/>
everyday...(much for the reason of being informed before I enter <br/>
Norrath)<br/>
<br/>
I have found EQ to be a stress reliever too. I know I am not alone <br/>
when I say that killing some mob in EQ after a very stressful and <br/>
LONG day doesnt make you feel good. It&#39;s a good feeling when you and <br/>
a group of people manage to kill a whole lot of mobs (train).<br/>
<br/>
Personally I have spent around 72 hours straight in EQ..only <br/>
stopping when my computer would crash or I lost connection. LOL. <br/>
Play the game, you will like it.</div>
