 </span></blockquote>2h blunt for Rangers is generally a waste of time.  If you want to <br/>
build it up just to you did that&#39;s fine.  The Ranger Epics are 2 <br/>
swords, meant for dual wielding.  So the &quot;vision&quot; is for Rangers to <br/>
use dual wield all the time.  That&#39;s what makes them different from <br/>
the Knights.<br/>
