<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760424921">The only real experience I&#39;ve had with a guild is the one I was in when I<br/>
was first getting started. We never did very much, since two poeple in it<br/>
shared a computer, but alas, it was dibanded for having too few members. I<br/>
have thought about joining a guild, but havn&#39;t run into anyone interested in<br/>
taking me in, nor have I really advertised that I&#39;m looking for one either.<br/>
<br/>
These days, when I am not battling the scourge of Norrath, I hang around the<br/>
Qeynos area helping those with less experience than myself.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry to hear that. The first guild I was in seemed cool at first.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Although<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I should have questioned it a bit more considering they didn&#39;t even ask me<br/>
&gt; if I wanted to join. I was fighting a battle and an invite popped up. I<br/>
&gt; clicked NO. Bc it was getting in the way of my fight. It popped up again.<br/>
&gt; Again I hit NO. Then it popped up again so I clicked YES just to make it<br/>
&gt; stop popping up. At that point I was so new to the game I really didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; understand what a guild was. Anyways, I made some good friends and was<br/>
&gt; having fun. But I noticed less and less of my friends were on.. I started<br/>
&gt; thinking about leaving. But my favorite person in the guild was a guild<br/>
&gt; officer and I didn&#39;t want to abandon her. Then I ran into my favorite<br/>
 </span></blockquote>person<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in the guild and she was in a different guild. I asked what happened and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>she<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; said that there had been some bickering amongst some of the leading<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She was very nice to me as always. Later on I was still thinking of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>leaving<br/>

&gt; day I mentioned my favorite person and that I was sorry she left the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>guild.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They started trashtalking her. I told them that I had really enjoyed the<br/>
&gt; guild because of her. Then they told me the only reason I was still in the<br/>
&gt; guild was bc none of the officers were in the same zone with me to disband<br/>
&gt; me. they started trashtalking me and claimed that I had badmouthed the<br/>
&gt; guild. What had really happened was someone asked me how I liked the guild<br/>
&gt; and I said I liked it fine. I said it was cool. I happened to add that I<br/>
&gt; thought another guild was cool too. I didn&#39;t say it was better or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>anything,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just that they were both cool. So that person reported to my guildleaders<br/>
&gt; that I badmouthed the guild. See, I had an alt in the other guild. I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>figured<br/>

 </span></blockquote>badmouthing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; me the guild leaders told me I had a choice: I could leave the guild or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>take<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; my alts out of the other guild. I told them that it was really sad bc we&#39;d<br/>
&gt; been friends the day before. But they were being so pissy. so I asked them<br/>
&gt; how I could disband myself from the guild. and I did it right then. I went<br/>
&gt; straight to the other guild and they invited me in right away.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s sad how guilds can be so fickle.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes, it can happen to you!  A few days ago, my hubby was having fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; with some guildmates when POOF! the guild was no more.  Took some<br/>
&gt; &gt; figuring out but apparently the person that originally started the<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild and was tagged as the &#39;owner&#39; wanted to make a new guild but was<br/>
&gt; &gt; unable because she was still listed as owning Circle of Majik.  She<br/>
&gt; &gt; had been forced out of the guild about a year ago because of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; thievery and lying.  She was unwelcome with the current leadership of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gawabiwa and could not get control except by force.  She went to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant and had her leader powers reinstated then promptly dropped<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone out of the guild without any kind of warning.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What a dirty underhanded thing to do!  She didn&#39;t have to drop<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone! or even anyone!  She could have come in and told everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; before hand, instead she had to yank it out from under us.  It hurt us<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the core, but Gawabiwa has built a close knit guild and we are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; our name.  We will rebuild our guild and get ourselves back on track.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  We won&#39;t be having anything to do with whatever guild she has whether<br/>
&gt; &gt; called Circle of Majik or not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We have lots of support too.  Check out the guild forum page for this<br/>
&gt; &gt; controversy<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One thing I&#39;ve learned, if the current leadership doesn&#39;t own the<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild, the owner can do anything they please with out anybody else&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; permission, and that is just plain wrong!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry about ranting so long, but I&#39;m mad about this.<br/>
