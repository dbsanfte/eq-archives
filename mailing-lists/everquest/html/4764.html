<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647259031">I personally was bummed when they made it impossible<br/>
to solo monks any more.  I haven&#39;t been feeling the<br/>
urge to log in much since they did that, so I was one<br/>
of the ones who voted to let people solo, even with a<br/>
penality... I&#39;d enjoy it more than begging for groups<br/>
in the planes.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in the game since 4/1/99 so I think I can<br/>
say with certainty that its a million times easier<br/>
than it used to be.  Many more zones, much less<br/>
crowding, tons of more items, features like the Bazaar<br/>
and being able to move around without a drood&#39;s help,<br/>
etc.  Its a better game now.  <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;d give it all back to not have to beg for<br/>
groups.  Sitting and spinning on my arse while I wait<br/>
for a group desperate enough to take a monk is a<br/>
bummer, and not fun in my view.  Figuring out a<br/>
stratagy to solo certain spots was great fun for me,<br/>
as well as the competition with other solo&#39;s for the<br/>
good spots.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t care so much about the monk nerf power wise<br/>
except that it came at a time when we were being<br/>
forced to group past 60... double whammy that makes it<br/>
hard to get in a group.<br/>

&gt; the game a young <br/>
&gt; chanter had no chance to group.  No one needed you<br/>
&gt; it also took away <br/>
&gt; from bards as mana batteries.  I am glad they<br/>
&gt; balanced it.  The <br/>
&gt; reason you are upset with your toon is its off the<br/>
&gt; crack and feeling <br/>
&gt; the shock of withdrawal.  Suck it up and learn to<br/>
&gt; play your toon.  <br/>
&gt; You will be glad you did later.  Its easy to play<br/>
&gt; any class if its <br/>
&gt; twinked out or buffed to the hilt.  Find a class you<br/>
&gt; like buck naked <br/>
&gt; and unbuffed thats where you will be happy in the<br/>
&gt; long haul.  For me <br/>
&gt; it was the Monk and Beastlord. A good place to try<br/>
&gt; all the classes is <br/>
&gt; on the test server do the test buff and bam your 25<br/>
&gt; with decent gear.<br/>
&gt;                   PS. For those of you with an eye<br/>
&gt; for grammer and <br/>
&gt; spelling, what can I say but enjoy =O`  /wink<br/>
