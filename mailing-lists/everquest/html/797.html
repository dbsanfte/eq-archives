<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016024495">Just a friendly warning to all EQ players out there - yours truly was the <br/>
subject of a scam that takes advantage of a new bug/exploit with the trade <br/>
window. An individual on Saturday night, who will for now remain anonymous, <br/>
offered to sell myself a Thick Banded Belt for 7500pp cash.<br/>
<br/>
Because I have been looking to obtain a Thick Banded Belt for quite some <br/>
time now, I eagerly went to the bank in Neriak and withdrew the money. Upon <br/>
my arrival in Eastern Commons, I found the individual where they said they <br/>
would be. They immediately placed the Thick Banded Belt into the trade <br/>
window, so I put my 7500pp there as well. I waited a few seconds, and then <br/>
the individual hit their trade button. I examined the item to ensure it was <br/>
what I was told it was. Once I verified the item to actually be a Thick <br/>
Banded Belt, I hit my trade button.<br/>
<br/>
As I began to walk away with my newly found and much sought after piece of <br/>
gear, I opened my inventory to find it so that I could equip the item. To my <br/>
amazement, it could not be found within my inventory. I immediately searched <br/>
all my packs, and it was no where to be found. Now I know what you must be <br/>
saying to yourself; that I must be stupid for having dropped such a valuable <br/>
item. Let me assure you that I had, and still do have more than enough empty <br/>
spots in my packs to hold many items, let alone just one.<br/>
<br/>
I immediately began to accost the individual responsible for having managed <br/>
to pull off this scam, and as I suspected, the individual had logged off <br/>
shortly after the transactions completion. I immediately petitioned a GM, <br/>
and approximately an hour later I received a response.<br/>
<br/>
I quickly explained what had happened to the GM, and was informed that a <br/>
database cross index search would be performed to find the account <br/>
information. The GM went on and explained to me that EVERY single trade or <br/>
transaction with an NPC/Player is kept track of so that in instances like <br/>
these or in the event of bugs, they can track down the information to <br/>
isolate the incident in question. The GM went on to say that they didn&#39;t <br/>
like to perform this type of search, as it was a long and involved process. <br/>
I went on to explain to the GM that I had screenshots of the transaction in <br/>
progress, and was promptly told that any and all screenshots were totally <br/>
useless as evidence. After all this had been explained to me, I was informed <br/>
that I would be contacted when the search had been completed.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday night came, and once again I petitioned to find out as to the status <br/>
of the search. After waiting approximately 2 hours, I was informed by the GM <br/>
that the account information had been found using the character name I had <br/>
provided. I was informed that they could find no records of a trade having <br/>
ever taken place between myself, and the exploiter. I was informed however <br/>
that they had at least been able to verify that I did indeed have 7500pp on <br/>
my character as I had claimed, and that they had no idea where it had <br/>
disappeared to. I was also informed that the character in question had been <br/>
deleted sometime in between Saturday and Sunday night.<br/>
<br/>
After a long and heated debate with the GM over the matter, the GM finally <br/>
reluctantly agreed to pull the character information off of the backup tapes <br/>
to see if the character in question had actually taken my 7500pp. The GM <br/>
went on to say that they could find no trace of the money on the character <br/>
in question, nor had the character traded it or any large amount of <br/>
expensive items off to someone else. The GM also stated that it made no <br/>
sense to delete a character that had such a large amount of cash, and that <br/>
in most all likely hood neither the Belt nor the cash would not be restored <br/>
to me. I was then informed that I again would be contacted after the <br/>
offending characters backup data had been viewed, so that they could verify <br/>
if they had actually gotten my cash.<br/>
<br/>
To date, the offenders entire account information has been found. It has <br/>
also been verified that I had 7500pp on my person as I had stated. However, <br/>
the servers GM can not find any record of this entire transaction having <br/>
ever taken place, but are totally ignoring the fact that 7500pp just <br/>
vanished off of my character without a trace. At the very least,  the sudden <br/>
disappearance of 7500pp off a character with no log as to it having been <br/>
traded away would signal that there was a serious bug/glitch that caused it <br/>
to disappear. To top it all off, I have screenshots of the transaction, but <br/>
the GM said they were useless. In addition to this, I have screenshots of <br/>
the conversations with the GM showing that all I have stated is true.<br/>
<br/>
I will again tonight (Monday Feb 7, 2000)  try and speak with the GM&#39;s to <br/>
get this matter resolved and have either my item or cash restored, and the <br/>
offender banned if I have anything to do with it. Why you ask have I posted <br/>
this information everywhere? I do it simply to warn everyone! Be extremely <br/>
careful who you trade with or you&#39;ll end up like me - 7500pp in the hole, <br/>
and no item to show for it! So now, I sit here on pins and needles, waiting <br/>
and hoping that the server didn&#39;t screw up and not save the data, so that I <br/>
may have my items/cash restored!<br/>
