<div id="ygrps-yiv-44561701">My main is a male character. I have talked to men who have their daughters<br/>
play as males so as not to be harassed by other players.<br/>
Heh. I&#39;ve had guys who know I&#39;m female hug and flirt with me to the raised<br/>
eyebrows of others.<br/>
It&#39;s pretty amusing. People really get confused when they don&#39;t know I&#39;m<br/>
female and don&#39;t know that the person I&#39;m calling &quot;sweetheart&quot; is my little<br/>
brother.<br/>
I have male characters on other servers but haven&#39;t played them much.<br/>
luv,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Ok, so how many male chars are played by women???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This would be funny. Knowing a male char is Female in<br/>
&gt; person and saying out of context.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Hey Regal, you are looking good sweetie?&quot;<br/>
&gt; NOTE: this should be said in a crowded place like the<br/>
&gt; EC tunnel........<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy would that draw attention...... lol<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ENJOY!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I read somewhere that approximately 1/6 of players<br/>
&gt; &gt; are really women. There are probabaly a lot of male<br/>
&gt; &gt; characters played by women. I think this will change<br/>
&gt; &gt; over time as videogames become a more popular form<br/>
&gt; &gt; of entertainment.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Not sure how true this is but it would be exciting<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   know that it is true.  Have been playing another<br/>
&gt; &gt; game<br/>
&gt; &gt;   (my bad) where i would have to say the majority of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   female characters ARE played by men...<br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; I just noticed recently that I seem to be<br/>

&gt; &gt; mean<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; characters played by women, is there any truth<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; this, or did I just not care in the past and<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
