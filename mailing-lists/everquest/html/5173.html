<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775706531">I think if you fight in EW it&#39;s best to say near the bridge to IC and to be<br/>
careful. there can be lots of adds. One good method I saw a druid using was<br/>
to snare a mob then cast camo on herself and run back to the bridge. That<br/>
way other mobs didn&#39;t see her running.<br/>
Also, if you can use the spell to charm an animal you can charm a wolf or<br/>
kitty to help you. Only problem is when charm wears off. If things go bad<br/>
you can run accross the bridge to zone.<br/>
I believe I hunted in DL at that lvl, but I&#39;m a cleric so I couldn&#39;t solo.<br/>
If you have Lost Dungeons of Norrath it&#39;s really great xp. I know you can&#39;t<br/>
solo, but the xp in group is worth it.<br/>

&gt; Ok I&#39;m asking the question....I&#39;m a 46 druid...and I&#39;m wondering<br/>
&gt; where you guys would solo at this point. I was doing the kiting in<br/>
&gt; GD on FG&#39;s..no I don&#39;t want to do the dwarf kiting.<br/>
