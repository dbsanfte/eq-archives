<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052814718">As an enchanter I am in the same boat as you when it comes to buff requests.<br/>
For haste and Clarity/Clarity 2, Wisdom and Int buffs ect ect.  Rude people<br/>
drive me up the wall as well but I don&#39;t see what is so rude about &quot;Can I<br/>
get a SoW?&quot;.  Maybe its just me, don&#39;t know.  I usually ask with something<br/>
like &quot;May I have sow, if your too busy its np at all.&quot;  That&#39;s almost<br/>
verbatim of how I ask for any kind of buff.  If they say they are too busy<br/>
or whatever I usually respond with something like &quot;Np, have a good day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But for the people who are truly rude and obnoxious to me I just type<br/>
/ignore xxxxxx, true once in a while I will have to delete my eqoptions file<br/>
from time to time to make room for new jerks (this does clear your friends<br/>
list btw).  However I don&#39;t always ignore them right away, I can type sort<br/>
of quick so sometimes I will bicker with them back in forth in tells for a<br/>
while then ignore them, I really enjoy a good argument.  : )  When I play my<br/>
friends druid from time to time I will sow most anyone that asks but HP<br/>
buffs TP&#39;s, Regen, Shield ect ect I will not unless its mem&#39;d and I have<br/>
extra mana I mean some of those spells are quite a bit of mana and to SLN<br/>
everyone that asks or regen can quite frankly become quite absurd.  Just<br/>
tell them no, if they don&#39;t understand, do you really care what they think?<br/>
I know that I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Its such a pain for me too because I have to un-memorize spells to buff<br/>
players under lvl 44 for most of the new spells I have so it gets very<br/>
annoying for instance.<br/>
<br/>
Stranger: (notice I don&#39;t call him beggar, because I ask for buffs too from<br/>
time to time)&quot;If you are not busy can you buff me and my friend?&quot; (usually<br/>
not this nice, =P)<br/>
Teenimu:  Surely, np.<br/>
/w stranger<br/>
Stranger(anon)<br/>
/g errrrr<br/>
Con stranger<br/>
Green<br/>
Right click spell slot one<br/>
/book 50<br/>
Beginning to memorize clarity<br/>
ect ect ect you can see where this could get very annoying.<br/>
<br/>
I know I have gone way off topic but I will use this time to complain about<br/>
something that bothers me.  I show up in Cobalt Scar after trying for an<br/>
hour or so to get a group up in Skyshrine that has some nads to go and kill<br/>
some of the Statues and Named Wryvns, but nobody will go.  So, I zone into<br/>
Cobalt Scar /w and see there are about 15 or so people here something like<br/>
that should be able to get a group.<br/>
<br/>
/lfg on<br/>
/ooc 55 Enchanter looking for group or partner<br/>
<br/>
In comes about 5 or 6 tells asking for clarity haste ect ect. But I ignore<br/>
them for the time being and /ooc again for a group and a few more tells come<br/>
in for buffs again so I start responding saying I&#39;d like to group with you<br/>
if possible hoping to get some exp.  Most of them respond with something<br/>
along the lines of sorry I am soloing I don&#39;t think you could really help<br/>
much anyways I do fine soloing.  Errrr well you will do fine without<br/>
clarity.  Well I endure the /poke and all the other emotes that people do to<br/>
beg for buffs from people that couldn&#39;t help in their group, blah blah blah.<br/>
Finally find two rangers to group with and finally got some really good exp<br/>
fear kitting was a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways rambled long enough, so in closing just put them on ignore.  lol<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Question for you druids out there ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure this thread has been beaten to death here but<br/>
I&#39;m going to ask it anyway cuz I&#39;m new to the list :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a 47 druid on Cazic-Thule and, like many of<br/>
you, I get *very* tired of being begged for SoW,<br/>
ports, HP buffs, etc. Also like many of you, I SoW,<br/>
buff, and port newbies and friendly people for free<br/>
whenever I can. I hand out nice weapons and decent<br/>
armor to newbies like they&#39;re candy, and I genuinely<br/>
enjoy helping people (That&#39;s a big reason I chose a<br/>
druid as my main).<br/>
<br/>
However, like almost all druids, I have times when<br/>
newbies and/or experienced players come up to me and<br/>
ask for things without saying please or when I&#39;m very<br/>
busy (like for instance the cleric just left the<br/>
group, we haven&#39;t found another healer, my heals blow,<br/>
but I am the primary healer until another is located).<br/>
I have a standard hotkey set up for those who ask for<br/>
SoW or whatever rudely (the &quot;Can I get a SoW&quot; irks me<br/>
no end): <br/>
<br/>
Beggar: Can I get a SoW?<br/>
Nymue: I&#39;m sorry, I do not comply with rude requests.<br/>
Nymue: Have a nice day!<br/>
<br/>
This does not work. They hang around begging, saying<br/>
please, and so on and so forth. One guy told me today,<br/>
&quot;Damn druids ruin the game.&quot; Lovely.<br/>
<br/>
So my poll today is to collect people&#39;s favorite ways<br/>
of denying requests when they don&#39;t want to/don&#39;t have<br/>
the time/are in a group/don&#39;t feel like complying. If<br/>
anyone has an amusing, polite, or snotty reply to<br/>
share with me I&#39;d love to hear it - I&#39;m going to set<br/>
my favorites up as hotkeys, so please don&#39;t share it<br/>
unless you don&#39;t mind me copying it :)<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s assistance,<br/>
