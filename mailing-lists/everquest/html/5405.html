<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431741971">I&#39;ve had monks, enchanters, bards, shadowknights, and paladins as pullers in<br/>
LDoN groups. Paladins and Encs can pacify. The bard that pulled in my group<br/>
was very good. Shadowknight could FD but not as well as a monk. I think it<br/>
all depends on what the other classes are in the group and how well they<br/>
work together.<br/>
