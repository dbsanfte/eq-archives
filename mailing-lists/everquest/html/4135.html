<div id="ygrps-yiv-270242366">I had a similar fun experience on Tarew Marr a while back. My cleric was in<br/>
SK fighting at &quot;KFC&quot; and picked up with three guildmates from a guild named<br/>
&quot;Seigneurs de la Lune Noire&quot;. It turns out they were all French Canadians<br/>
from Quebec. Two of them spoke very little English, while one of them was<br/>
fluent in both English and French.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to dust off my rusty college French (don&#39;t ask how long it&#39;s been)<br/>
and attempt to communicate with them in their native tongue. I know I made a<br/>
bunch of grammatical errors, but they seemed to really enjoy my efforts and<br/>
I know I enjoyed grouping with them and speaking French with them.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wanted to take a moment and tell you about the recent experience I had<br/>
in a group over in Lavastorm Mountains.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was just hanging out over there in the entrance to Najena hunting Fire<br/>
Drakes and such outside. It was good leveling and they dropped some decent<br/>
coin for a lower level player. Well I havened to meet up with two Dark Elves<br/>
from Germany. one spoke no english but the other was able to translate for<br/>
her. They asked me to join their group and I did. I have to say that was one<br/>
of the funnest groups I have ever been in! I&#39;m kind of a communications buff<br/>
so it was very fun for me to watch and read the chat between them. It was<br/>
also a good opportunity for me to maybe pick up a few new words!<br/>
