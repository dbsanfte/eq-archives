<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038185998">RE: [EverQuest] Role Playingthats true.. but this game was meant to be an RPG and you find people running around twinking or overcharging for their services or making characters just for selling crap instead of /auctioning. ive seen some of these people, it pisses me off. this is a RPG, not some stupid place you run around greedy ripping people off. They disrespect necromancers, not through the character, but in their own words. that is not right and I believe its called necrobashing..? its hard to play them now with everyone giving you bs dueling you all the time<br/>

  You just have to face it.. everybody wants everything today. Its just a representation of soceity and the culture we live in.  I myself look at them sometimes when i feel im stuck.  The problem is though is.. during the game people /ooc or /shout out for solutions and people are so quick to give them the answer to any question. Unfortutely the answer is right there i cant block it out I can remove it from my mind.  I just wish that people would try to keep some mystery to the game, and i know i can just filter out Shouts and Out of Characters but... i shouldnt have to do that to enjoy the game.  Everyone just wants a hand out.. :)<br/>

  this is pretty lame... this is an RPG, but on all the polls, people want <br/>
  walkthroughs on quests? where is the fun in that? maybe a hint or 2, but its <br/>
  no fun walking around following a guide telling you to avoid so and so <br/>
  whatever to not get killed. <br/>
  just wondering if anyone aggrees with this... <br/>
