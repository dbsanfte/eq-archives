<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359254274">While I have to accept Trevor&#39;s observation on QC from STB - I have a V3<br/>
2000 and its behaved flawlessly..<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of comments to make:<br/>
<br/>
1) From most research I&#39;ve seen - the TnT2 Ultra is a greater performer than<br/>
the Vooodoo3 2000 - especially given the speeds they are clocked at.  The<br/>
TnT2 also will support 32-bit textures - which will make a HUGE difference<br/>
that the 16-bit hardware that the Voodoo3 (22-bit in software but that will<br/>
cause another performance hit)  Note that the 2000 is easily overclockable<br/>
(but you&#39;ll need to add a fan).  Note that as far as I know - there&#39;s not a<br/>
single game out there now that supports above 16-bit textures so TODAY this<br/>
isn&#39;t an issue.<br/>
<br/>
On-the-other-hand:<br/>
The 2000 cost me $129 at Best Buy - the TnT2 Ultra will cost AT LEAST $100<br/>
more than that (possibly more - I haven&#39;t been pricing them)<br/>
If you are on a budget this is huge.  Also keep in mind - if you are ONLY<br/>
playing Everquest - I&#39;ve seen TONS of posts from people having problems with<br/>
the V770. Sounds like Diamond (Nvidia?) need to fix the driver for EQ.  My<br/>
2000 has behaved flawlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Also - the Matrox G400 is out now as well a buddy of mine claims it smokes<br/>
the TnT2 - but I haven&#39;t done research to verify this.  If you  can afford<br/>
$250 list for a V770 Ultra or a Matrox G400 AND plan on playing games other<br/>
than EQ consider forgoing the V3 2000<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion - the 2000 is the best performer for the price (also - I am<br/>
running a 300 MHz machine so I won&#39;t see a speed difference with the faster<br/>
cards anyway).  But given Trevor&#39;s concern - save that receipt, packing<br/>
materials, etc in case you have to return a defective card.  I haven&#39;t had<br/>
ANY probs with the 2000 and am REALLY satisfied with it.<br/>
<br/>
2) SOME I repeat SOME people how are on @Home cable modem service have<br/>
severely high Packet Loss problems with Everquest.  MANY people on the same<br/>
company have no problems at all.  If you are considering @home  I would<br/>
recommend posting on alt.games.Everquest and the www.eqvault.com Tech<br/>
webboard asking for people in your exact area if they have problems.  If<br/>
your cable is a different company I would sign up for cable as fast as you<br/>
possibly can!<br/>

&gt; DONT get the Voodoo 3 anything go for a Nvidia Ultra Tnt2.  I work at<br/>
&gt; CompUSA and have seen toooo many returns of the STB (yes STB makes the<br/>
3dfx<br/>
&gt; cards) crud..The Diamond 770 or thr Creative Ultra TNT2 is alot better<br/>
deal.<br/>
