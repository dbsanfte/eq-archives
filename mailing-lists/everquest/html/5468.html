The Plains root and water flask combination will make Plains Dye. <br/>
This is used for LoY tailored robes not to dye armor. <br/>
 If want you are wanting to do is change the color of visible armor <br/>
on your toon, then here is what you need to do:<br/>
 <br/>
 First, you need the LoY expansion.(just a reminder)<br/>
 Now time to make some stuff:<br/>
    In a kiln put a Unfired Vial and a High Quality Firing Sheet<br/>
  the trivial on this is 54. (pottery skill)<br/>
    In a brew barrel or medicine bag combine a Prism Shard and Glaze <br/>
Lacquer, this is also trivial at 54. (brewing skill)<br/>
    You now will have a Dye Vial and Prismatic Dye, combine these two <br/>
items in a brew barrel or medicine bag. trivial at 68<br/>
<br/>
 On your inventory screen there is a button that says dye. This is <br/>
used to pick the color to dye your armor.<br/>
<br/>
 Good Luck<br/>

&gt; I have a question about dying my armor. Is there a website that has <br/>
&gt; the dye recipes and the steps I need to take to make dyes? I found <br/>
&gt; something on Allakazham but it just listed the components needed <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; not what I need to do with them. I hunted in N. Karana to kill <br/>
&gt; beetles and get Plains Roots and put one at a time in a brewer <br/>
along <br/>
&gt; with a water flask. I am up to 3 in brewing now LOL. But no dye. Do <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; need to be putting a bottle or empty flask in there too with the <br/>
&gt; other stuff? And does anybody know what color Plains Dye is? Thanks <br/>
&gt; in advance for your help.<br/>
