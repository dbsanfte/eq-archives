<div id="ygrps-yiv-727725599"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">My husband has been playing it. &nbsp;In fact, after a few days, he cancelled his EQ account and is solely playing DAoC. &nbsp;He keeps telling me to try it but I tell him I like EQ just fine. &nbsp;From watching him, I can tell I don&#39;t wanna play. &nbsp;BUT he&#39;s a hardcore gamer and EQ and Solitaire are the only games I play. &nbsp;He says it&#39;s like EQ but better. &nbsp;
