<div><font face="Arial" size="2">the newest expansion is Omens of War, and spend 3 
AA points and yo can get a 9th spell slot.&nbsp; To me, it&#39;s the greatest thing 
abotu the expansion.&nbsp; I tell ya, that slot comes in so handy, and it&#39;s 
somethign I requested they add back when Kunark came out.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">currently, my druid on Cazic Thule (my main) is up 
to level 64 and AA grinding.&nbsp; I already have the title of Baron, and 
halfway through the points I need for Venerable, but I&#39;m having to do back 
buying of AA skills so I can get ready for some of the Advanced skills.&nbsp; by 
that I mean I want to get Advanced Innate wisdom, but to do that I need Innate 
Wisdom maxed.&nbsp; So I&#39;m spending points ont he general skills instead of 
saving up for the ones I want.&nbsp; But at 64, AA points come pretty 
quick.&nbsp; I can usually do 2 in about 3 hours, so it&#39;s not so 
bad.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Hello fellow EQ addicts!&nbsp; For the few who might of 
  known me..well I am back.<br>For those who don&#39;t remember here is a little 
  story on how I got into this<br>group.&nbsp; Last year I was in the gulf for 9 
  months with no EQ (only thing that<br>kept me sane was my collection of EQ 
  guides) and I managed to have a buddy<br>of mine register this email address 
  with Yahoo Groups..so while I was at sea<br>I could still keep up with the 
  latest EQ news.&nbsp; When I came back mid Nov. I<br>was amazed at all the 
  changes the game has been thru (before I left I just<br>had downloaded LoY) 
  now I&#39;m upto date with all the expansions.&nbsp; So anyway<br>here is a little 
  info about me:<br><br>I have been playing EQ now since June of 02 (a buddy of 
  mine got me started)<br>and have been addicted ever since.&nbsp; I spent the 
  majority of my time making<br>all kinds of characters, deleting them, making 
  more, deleting<br>those..etc.,just to see how each class is like.&nbsp; Well I 
  have finally managed<br>to stick with a class I like which is my main 53 DE 
  SK..3 more AAs and I get<br>a title heh.&nbsp; I play on the Ayonae Ro server 
  (with a couple old alts on<br>Tunare) and I am a member of the Caelitus guild 
  and have been for about 5<br>1/2 months now.&nbsp; Here is a list of all 
  my..mains.<br><br>Ayonae Ro Server<br>Bloodbrood Deathdisciple 53 dark elf
