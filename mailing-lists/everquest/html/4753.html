<div id="ygrps-yiv-394677162">Hi Su. I was a bit upset when they took KEI away from lower-level <br/>
casters at first. But now I have learned to buff myself with my <br/>
Breeze spell, and to find safer places to med while my mana regains. <br/>
It does make the game more challenging, but also make me think about <br/>
better strategies. Now I am hoping to get to level 29 soon so I can <br/>
write my Clarity spell. I want to sell Clarity buffs to make a bit of <br/>
money to bank so I can buy my other spells (spells are quite <br/>
expensive as you level I have noticed). <br/>

&gt; I mean this in the nicest way possible, but if you spelled things <br/>
&gt; correctly, it might help your case a little more. I&#39;m not trying to <br/>
&gt; insult you, but if I were someone working for Sony and I saw the <br/>
&gt; spelling errors in this I would assume that you were either a child <br/>
&gt; or that you didn&#39;t really care enough about the message to use <br/>
&gt; correct spelling.<br/>
&gt; A few things to point out: the correct spelling is Verant. However <br/>
&gt; Verant no longer has anything to do with Everquest. Quitting is the <br/>
&gt; correct spelling. Meditating, Originally, Having, Minutes, <br/>
Available, <br/>
&gt; Appreciate and so forth. Spellcheck can run a long ways.<br/>
&gt; I hope you don&#39;t use &quot;horse shit&quot; as an expression in your letter.<br/>
&gt; That said, I can understand why they &quot;nerfed&quot; C2 and C3. It made it <br/>
&gt; harder for lower level enchanters to compete with higher level <br/>
&gt; enchanters in selling their buffs, and it made fighting less <br/>
&gt; challenging for lower level characters than the creators had <br/>
&gt; intended. Basically, players became so dependent on the buffs that <br/>
&gt; they did not learn how to conserve mana and play the characters in <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; manner the creators had intended.<br/>
&gt; It did not take the fun out of the game. There are still many <br/>
things <br/>
&gt; to enjoy. Some of the changes have made the game more exciting. <br/>
They <br/>
&gt; have also added new quests for lower level characters and added <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; features to make things easier for new characters that are just <br/>
&gt; starting out.<br/>
&gt; Some examples: When I first started out if you were low level and <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; died you had a short period of time to get your corpse back. If you <br/>
&gt; did not you lost it and all of your gear. And you lost xp even at <br/>
&gt; level 6. Now you don&#39;t lose your corpse or xp until level 10.<br/>
&gt; There is a feedback system you can use and you can email customer <br/>
&gt; service. I think that quitting EverQuest over a few changes is a <br/>
bit <br/>
&gt; extreme. But I guess what it comes down to is your enjoyment of the <br/>
&gt; game. If you no longer enjoy it, then you do not have to play.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>

&gt; &gt; DUe to the frequent changes sony/varent has induced into this <br/>
game <br/>
&gt; &gt; such as revamping some perfectly fine zones and make them harder <br/>
&gt; than <br/>
&gt; &gt; orginaly, and swiping c3 and even c2 from our collective grasp, <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; famley members who play this game will be writing sony and they <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; &gt; shortly and most likely <br/>
&gt; &gt; be quiting this game, which in effect may lead to my defection as <br/>
&gt; &gt; well due to the incressing dificulty of this so call &quot;class <br/>
&gt; balancing&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; now mind you this is total horse shit on sonys part, and they are <br/>
&gt; &gt; taking all the fun and adventur out of this game by making every <br/>
&gt; &gt; thing totaly impossible and un reachable, now i know not every <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; &gt; feels like this but not every one is a druid who with out c3 can <br/>
&gt; &gt; cast no more that 3 spells with out haveing to sit for 20 minets <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; meddititing for example<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What im asking my fellow everquest players and there friends is <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; &gt; there suport in the effort we are trying to get sony to see, that <br/>
&gt; &gt; they are systematicly desimating a game that once was fun and <br/>
&gt; &gt; enjoyable. Once this letter is writin i will have it in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the forums here with sonys email which we have directed these <br/>
&gt; coments.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We would appriciate the suport of our fellow gamers and friends <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; &gt; they too would also after that time email sony and the like with <br/>
&gt; &gt; their concers and grips- please once this is posted consider our <br/>
&gt; &gt; request as some one has to fight back again the few who decide <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; &gt; need to nerf our spells, our strengh and our fun in this game <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I will be posting the letter and the email address as soon as it <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; &gt; made aviabel and i will be posting this accross as many forums as <br/>
i <br/>
&gt; &gt; can find hoping to fight back against the evil that is the <br/>
&gt; everquest <br/>
&gt; &gt; managemnt. <br/>
&gt; &gt; thank you for taking your time to read this </span></blockquote></div>
