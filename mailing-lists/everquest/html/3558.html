What do you mean send it back?<br/>
If this is win 2000, you can install the OS to another<br/>
directory just to get into the machine.  Granted<br/>
things won&#39;t be installed but you could test whether<br/>
it is OS related or something else.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you should be able to uninstall the SP.<br/>
However, if the machine blue screens, then the other<br/>
option you have it just after starting your machine, I<br/>
am not sure on the key it might be different but you<br/>
should be able to hit F8 every three seconds or so and<br/>
get a menu.<br/>
<br/>
From that menu you can choose &quot;last known good&quot;, and<br/>
other options, try things like safe mode or other<br/>
basic ones to see if you can get in.  <br/>
<br/>
Once you get in, try to uninstall the SP.<br/>
This might sound crazy but was the SP the only thing<br/>
you installed?  I have seen before where people<br/>
install an SP, then update thier video driver from a<br/>
site, only to reboot after both installs.  Then when<br/>
the machine does not boot, they point it to the SP.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure your level of expertise with computers,<br/>
so bear in mind I am thinking of the least amount of<br/>
knowledge with my suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
let me know if any of this works, before you go<br/>
shipping it out.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
<br/>
