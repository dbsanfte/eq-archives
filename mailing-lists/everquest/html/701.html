 I&#39;m rather fed up with Verant! They&#39;re constantly nerfing everything ingame <br/>
 that&#39;s worth while, or ignoring classes that need to be balanced or <br/>
 upgraded! So in retrospect, I&#39;m looking to find greener pastures elsewhere. <br/>
 Perhaps someone out there knows of another game (other than AC and UO) or <br/>
 perhaps a group who&#39;s programming their own game similar to EQ? If so, <br/>
 please don&#39;t hesistate to drop me a line or two via email. Tks in advance!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have finally found a game that is good enough to pull me away from EQ.  It <br/>
is called Homeworld.  Homeworld not anything like EQ or even a RPing game.  <br/>
What it is however, is the most immersive, well scripted, graphically <br/>
astounding and gameplay addictive game that I have found since EQ came out.   <br/>
It&#39;s hard to describe in words what this game is like, I suggest everyone <br/>
download the demo and try it fer yourself.  The demo had me hooked after just <br/>
the tutorial and I rushed out to get the game immediately. <br/>
