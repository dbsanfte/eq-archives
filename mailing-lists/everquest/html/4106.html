<div id="ygrps-yiv-920682580"><p>first of all, hi, and yes you do have to be on line
<p>second, rangers are basic casters of nature and warriors, basic hybrid of druid and warrior
<p>third, rogues can backstab, but you have to be behind enemy, and you can miss them. you also get the sneak/hide ability, its invisibility basically without the mana, but you move slower
<p>other classes are good, it depends on what you want to be, rogues can travel without being seen and outdamage in melee, but wizards out damage in spells. however you need to gain a few levels in order to make yourself useful to others. enchanters are much wanted when levels 16+ and wizards are not that wanted at lower levels. monks are basic hand to hand no mana classes, and are not tanks, nor do they not carry a lot. warriors are pure melee, they are the tanks of the classes. shamans are known for slows and dots, not only the famous sow and talismans. druids are good for sow too, but also for druid portals, another form of teleport.they also get thorns and anti-animal spells, not only skin buffs. rangers are hybrids of this and a warrior. clerics are very wanted in the later levels as well as lower. they get the best heals, and one of the best hp buffs, not only that but high percentage ressurects. paladins are hybrids between a cleric and warrior, but not as wanted really. bards are song players, they play songs. they are wanted later on, such as level 20 or so. they are pretty much a melee class anyway. enchanters get spells like clarity or breeze, which help replenish mana. they also get &#39;crowd-control&#39; spells. they can stun, mezz, quicken, even charm. although they dont get that great of a pet since it doesnt listen to you, they are good in other aspects. a beastlord is a shaman and monk. it has shaman spells, gets a warder as a pet though, and uses hand to hand as primary fighting.a magician can summon items, such as food and drink, and has several pets. it also has the best aoe spells. a necromancer is one who uses poison spells and pets such as skeletons. a shadow knight is a warrior combined with a necromancer. a rogue is a class that can sneak and hide behind any creature and not be seen, well almost any. they also get backstab which out damages any melee person. well, that should be about it
<p>last, welcome again and yes this game is very addictive :)
