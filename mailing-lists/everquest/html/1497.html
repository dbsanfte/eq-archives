<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939494844">I enjoy the teamwork aspect of these games.  The fact you can build up<br/>
reputations and meet hundred and thousands of people from all different<br/>
walks of life.  My entire guild is Chinese with the exception of my real<br/>
life brother and one other guy I met online.  If I was sitting playing<br/>
Legend of Zelda or a Final Fantasy game would I ever get a chance to do<br/>
that?  Like it or not Role Playing is a very small aspect of this game.<br/>
This is the 3rd Massive online game I have played (UO and Meridian) and I<br/>
will prob. play them for many years to come.  <br/>

I have to wonder why you even bother to play EQ in that case.  Why spend<br/>
$10 a month when you can buy Final Fantasy, Legend of Zelda or any number<br/>
of other &quot;kill-loot-level&quot; fantasy games.  At least then you only spend<br/>
your money once.  Plus, you don&#39;t have to deal with lag, ridiculously long<br/>
loading screens between zones and you can pause if you want to go grab a<br/>
soda or hit the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of the online experience, as I see it, is that beyond the rules<br/>
and the imagination of the developers and artists who made the game, you<br/>
also have the total combined imaginations of literally thousands of<br/>
players.  Of course, that only works if other players are, in fact, being<br/>
creative...<br/>

I dunno, I sort of enjoy the hack and loot aspect too.  I role play from<br/>
time to time but very little actually.  Mostly I will hit duck and walk<br/>
around like that complaining I have scurvy or something and I need some<br/>
Vitamin C. I think most Gnomes suffer from scurvy anyways.  That&#39;s the<br/>
extent of my role-playing.  : )<br/>

I think you hit it. How one approaches the game will deeply affect<br/>
the experience. I will try to keep your advice in mind when I lose my<br/>
perspective in playing.<br/>
<br/>
So far, it is a grand experience.<br/>

&gt; It seems to me that the only problem with twinking is that EQ has<br/>
become a<br/>
&gt; game about killing, levelling, and looting.  If it were truly a<br/>
roleplaying<br/>
&gt; game, this would not even be an issue.  If your main drive in the<br/>
game is<br/>
&gt; to get the bigger and better item (whatever it may be), you will<br/>
always<br/>
&gt; have low level players trying to be twinked and you will always have<br/>
&gt; jealous &quot;un-twinked&quot; players.  But when did the term &quot;roleplaying<br/>
game&quot;<br/>
&gt; turn into &quot;hack and loot&quot;?<br/>
