<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103297788">Hey, did you ever try the running in lava bug near the giants? I saw someone<br/>
who had a train of giants do this. She ran into the lava and the giants ran<br/>
after her. When the giants stepped back in the lava they got full life back<br/>
and returned to their spawn points. It apparently nullified the aggro too.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t work well with the caster ones and king though.<br/>
Oh, a bit of advice for any clerics waiting on Ragefire to pop in sola.. if<br/>
anyone pulls a train anywhere near you or runs to naggy, camp and wait a few<br/>
minutes. Sometimes the train runs around rampant after the person dies or<br/>
escapes and they will jump right on you.<br/>
