<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036857097">I feel like venting about something that has been going on with guilds on my server...<br/>
Does anyone else find it annoying when you&#39;ve been in a guild for 4 years as an officer and some new people come along and when you&#39;re not looking one of the new people becomes leader without your approval and then starts telling you that you have to change the way you talk in guild and who you hang out with and stuff like that?<br/>
Or is it just me?<br/>
