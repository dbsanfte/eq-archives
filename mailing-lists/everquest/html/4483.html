<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201893633">In my experience playing my Shaman on the Saryrn server a  decent balance of<br/>
both your Mana pool as well as what ever it is you use to generate your mana<br/>
(Wis for priest classes and Int for the rest of the casters) can  not lead<br/>
you wrong.  IF you remember  more of one or the other could be a good thing<br/>
or a bad thing.   My mistake with my shaman was  getting more of the Wis<br/>
items to build up my mana, however I always tried to find stuff that<br/>
included an addition to my mana with  &quot;x&quot; amount of mana to try and balance<br/>
it out.  Unfortunately the price of things in the bazaar tended to deplete<br/>
my funds for tradeskills like &quot;Alchemy&quot; (still can&#39;t believe the prices for<br/>
making those durned potions) but the more my wis  ultimately led to the<br/>
better my success rates in making my  tradeskill items. But I digress. Most<br/>
people will tell you put more into the mana pool and forget about the mana<br/>
regenerator ability. In Ya&#39;lls case Intelligence. Others will tell you the<br/>
exact opposite cause they say that you will regenerate your mana pool faster<br/>
as well as increase it per level. Myself I prefer  the balance of both equal<br/>
of my wis to the addition of whatever the mana plus is included on the item.<br/>

&gt; Hmm I can&#39;t tell you the answer to your specific<br/>
&gt; question but my mage was given one of these as well<br/>
&gt; and I love it. I am level 34 and think it is a Great<br/>
&gt; piece of gear, unless you can afford a UBA TWINKED<br/>
&gt; one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I too look forward to what others have to say about<br/>
&gt; this one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Great Question<br/>
