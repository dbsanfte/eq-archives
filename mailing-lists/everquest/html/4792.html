mobs of the same con. Just watch out for adds.<br/>

&gt; Hail, All.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a Half Elf Ranger of the 11th season, a faithful member of the<br/>
&gt; guild Legendary Legacy, and a Protector of the Pine on the Druzzil<br/>
&gt; Ro server.  I&#39;m having some trouble and need advice on the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.) I am &quot;solo&quot;-ing bandits in Western Karana for the xp and<br/>
&gt; sashes.  I am pulling one or two at time and most con white or dark<br/>
&gt; blue to me.  The problem is the bandit casters that con dark blue<br/>
&gt; are kicking my butt.  Any Advice?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.) I am trying to procure a perfect quality bear skin for the cape<br/>
&gt; quest.  I took about 25 brown and grizzly bears last night, and<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t get a single one.  Any advice on which drops them more<br/>
&gt; frequently or how rare they are?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.) Finally, what are there yellow and red cons that I may be able<br/>
&gt; to take down at this level?  I am extremely anxious to reach the<br/>
&gt; 15th season and get my dual wield.  I have pretty decent gear<br/>
&gt; courtesy of my guild-mates.  Any pointers would be great.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  I am particularly interested in taking down the werewolf that<br/>
&gt; roams WK.  He&#39;s snuck up on me and offed me 3 times now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you in advance,<br/>
&gt; Jaxun<br/>
