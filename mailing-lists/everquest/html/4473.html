<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124006517">You are right, it doesn&#39;t help you.  I was just<br/>
moaning that my 61 char is in the same exact boat but<br/>
Sony doesn&#39;t think my class is &quot;brutally broken&quot;. <br/>
Heh.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you should go to sol b.  Do the zone area<br/>
(30-34), then pool groups (35-40), then royal groups<br/>
(40-45), then bats (45-52), then bats &#39;n bugs (52-56),<br/>
then ldc (57-61).  That&#39;ll get you to 61.<br/>
<br/>
With my monk I solo&#39;d there the whole way along that<br/>
path.  As a rogue you&#39;d probably rather partner with<br/>
someone who can taunt, but you&#39;d also have light blue<br/>
exp opportunity the whole time.  If I could avoid PoP<br/>
and go back to sol b for 61 - 65 I&#39;d do it in a flash<br/>
(I loved that place).  Giants are too hard to solo for<br/>
a 61 monk, and ldc gave very slight light blue exp you<br/>
can&#39;t advance on... so no choices for me now but PoP,<br/>
and I dislike PoP (can&#39;t solo there, nobody wants<br/>
monks).<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve pondered for awhile.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My rogue is level 32.  I play him infrequently.  At<br/>
&gt; level 30 rogues get all the skills they are going to<br/>
&gt; get.  Rogues are non-casters so they don&#39;t have new<br/>
&gt; spells to look forward to.  The only things rogues<br/>
&gt; have to look forward to are their disciplines at<br/>
&gt; level 50.  So how does one get from level 30 to<br/>
&gt; level 50 in the shortest amount of time possible? <br/>
&gt; Whenever I play, it seems like I always have a hard<br/>
&gt; time finding a group.  I&#39;m looking in places like<br/>
&gt; Frontier Mountains, The Overthere, and Dawnshroud<br/>
&gt; Peaks.  I&#39;m not high enough level that I can easily<br/>
&gt; solo any mobs in either of those zones. But nobody<br/>
&gt; seems to want to group.  So are there any zones<br/>
&gt; where I can get quick xp by soloing?  Or are there<br/>
&gt; other zones I could try for groups?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hate for my rogue to fall by the way side because<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s become a bore to play.  So any suggestions you<br/>
&gt; have for playing rogue characters to help me out<br/>
&gt; would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>
