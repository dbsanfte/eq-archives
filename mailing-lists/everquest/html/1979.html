<div id="ygrps-yiv-446586384">Well said Lance! I am in total awe of SoL. It is like a whole new game. I<br/>
want to go and visit EVERY Old World zone again. I was running through<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron and I could not believe they made a very ugly plain zone<br/>
look so beautiful. I mean I thought this zone was just grayish rocks with<br/>
water in the middle. Well, not now. It looks so very good. I now want to go<br/>
to every zone just to view the scenery. <br/>
<br/>
Btw, I got a new computer just for the SoL. I had an old W95, 300 MHz, 256<br/>
RAM that ran the Old World ok, but now with my new PC, wow, what a change. I<br/>
have P4 1.7 MHz, 80 gig HD, 512 RAM, geforce 3 400 and run this on a DSL<br/>
that downloads around 1,200 kbs and uploads ~ 800 kbs. Last night in the SoL<br/>
I was zoning in 20-30 seconds ( glad they fixed this yesterday ) and very<br/>
little to no lag. The ping bar looked good all night, with left side max<br/>
around 200 and staying in double digits and on the EQ side around 2,000 max.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t be happier with SoL. I can understand Verant wanting to get the<br/>
product out on time, but I can also see the customer side. But I would have<br/>
been happy enough just with the new zone graphics and the new AA experience.<br/>
This new experience really offers the +51 player a lot of cool skill to<br/>
shoot for.<br/>

	It has nothing to do with a low res version of Vah Shir model.  In<br/>
fact that<br/>
	is in the game now.  With the SoL expansion you can set it on a low<br/>
res<br/>
	version of the entire game or high if you choose to ( that includes<br/>
both<br/>
	game world and player models ).  The whole problem here is when<br/>
Microsoft<br/>
	made a majority of video cards obsolete with the release of directx<br/>
8..<br/>
	PERIOD...  Everquest is over 3 years old now.  When it was first<br/>
released<br/>
	Directx was in release 6.  Since then with the introduction of<br/>
Kunark and<br/>
	Velious, players were required to upgrade to release 7.  Directx 7<br/>
made<br/>
	minor improvements to 6, however, didn&#39;t require changes to the home<br/>
users<br/>
	PC.  <br/>
<br/>
	If you have Luclin you can immediately see the improvements in<br/>
graphics.. It<br/>
	looks absolutely great.  Problem is for a game that&#39;s been out so<br/>
long they<br/>
	need to keep up with the release schedule of Microsoft&#39;s DirectX.<br/>
With the<br/>
	introduction of WindowsXP they ( they being Microsoft ) introduced a<br/>
new<br/>
	release version 8.  Everquest is a game that has gone through 3<br/>
different<br/>
	versions of directx in order to keep up with the visual quality that<br/>
ever<br/>
	other game out there has had the luxury of not having to contend<br/>
with.  I<br/>
	guarantee that if any other game out there attempted to provide the<br/>
	enhancements and a quality product that incorporated the latest<br/>
video<br/>
	standards they would be experiencing the same problem.  Do you see<br/>
any other<br/>
	company even attempting to release a updated DirectX 8 version?<br/>
Return to<br/>
	Castle Wolfenstein was released and is a DirectX 8 only product that<br/>
	incorporates the same technology improvements.  You will, however,<br/>
never see<br/>
	a DirectX 9 version... Nor will they be supporting the same program<br/>
3 years<br/>
	from now.<br/>
<br/>
	Hehe.. Computer technology changes every few months.. If your still<br/>
using<br/>
	the same computer you had 3 years ago, its probably time to upgrade.<br/>
Ah<br/>
	well.. Its Christmas :)<br/>
