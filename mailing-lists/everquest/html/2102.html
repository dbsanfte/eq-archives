Sure I still get lag in a few areas and I don&#39;t have full cliping plane.<br/>
But I have it as a resonable distance and its pretty seemless.  Some zones<br/>
were really laggy when the Luclin was released, however, now its pretty much<br/>
seemless in old, kunark and velious zones.  Some aspects of Luclin lag<br/>
occasionally but nothing to complain about.<br/>
<br/>
I do find that if your running a card with Anti-Aliasing the spell graphics<br/>
really tend to have an effect on the performance of the graphics card.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure many of you have noticed when you have spell graphics on and a Mage/Wiz<br/>
does a Fire Rain spell most of us are instantly hit with mega lag.  Same<br/>
thing happens toward most spells when AA is turned on.  Leave it off and it<br/>
runs nice and smooth.<br/>
<br/>
I know the specs are on the high side, but I&#39;d gladly help anyone in<br/>
pointing them to low cost solutions.<br/>

I just added the necessary memory to max out my system. <br/>
Unfortunately, that max is 256. I would love to go to 512 or more, <br/>
but that would require a new system.<br/>
<br/>
Things have improved with the added memory, but I still get lots of <br/>
lag in Rivervale, and similar town type zones. My graphics card is an <br/>
Nvidia TNT 64 (don&#39;t know what the 64 means, it is 32meg). It is the <br/>
best I could find last year for the money I had, and more than <br/>
adequate for the game at that time. I needed pci, so my choices were <br/>
a bit limited. More than that, my knowledge was much less in those <br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious as to what kinds of graphics cards people use, and <br/>
whether or not they are experiencing lag in zones like Rivervale in <br/>
spite of having a pretty good system.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a killer rig, and still find lag or other problems? I <br/>
just wonder how much is the game, how much my now low end system.<br/>
