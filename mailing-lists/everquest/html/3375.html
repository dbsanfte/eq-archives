&gt; once I get set up to sell, but the set up is<br/>
&gt; terrible. Move cursor. <br/>
&gt; Not on object. Move a bit more. Not on object. Move<br/>
&gt; back. Click. <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t have object. Click again. Hmph. Had object but<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know it, <br/>
&gt; and just put it back. Click...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Took so long that I didn&#39;t finish setting up before<br/>
&gt; I had to log. I <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t have logged if I could have left my toon to<br/>
&gt; do business <br/>
&gt; while I was gone, but no such luck.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just gotta get another machine, faster connection,<br/>
&gt; and retire from <br/>
&gt; my job so that I can play all the time.<br/>
