<div id="ygrps-yiv-254473952">You go from a ship in Stonebrunt, but instead of working on a timed schedule<br/>
like old world boats, you simply click the door and it zones you over. I<br/>
thought it seemed like it ran pretty well on my 450 mhz, actually, and was<br/>
one of the most &quot;old world&quot; zones out of any expansion since Luclin. Jagged<br/>
Pine is a bit rougher, think NK on crack, or a hyped version of DSP. The<br/>
critters are aggressive and generally powerful. The humanoids in JP are<br/>
somewhat easier, in fact my warrior soloed at the poachers at 51 and 52.<br/>
Some of the various loots from the zone are nice, some weapons and jewelry.<br/>
The poachers drop pelts also, never lower than LQ, so for more advanced<br/>
tailoring, this place is heaven.<br/>

&gt; We bought the expansion for some of the features, rather than any<br/>
&gt; plans to go there. However, since we got the new computer, I have been<br/>
&gt; thinking of someday making the trip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trouble is, I don&#39;t know how to get there. Granted, I haven&#39;t yet<br/>
&gt; tried, but when I look on some of the EQ sites I visit, I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; any way to get there. Is there a boat? From where? Is it even worth<br/>
&gt; going there?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t even gone to Jagged Pines since we got a machine that makes<br/>
&gt; the zone playable. In fact, I need to visit lots of places. I have<br/>
&gt; only limited experience on Luclin due to the lag. Been working Crystal<br/>
&gt; Caverns this last week, my first week on the new machine.<br/>
