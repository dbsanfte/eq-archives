<div id="ygrps-yiv-306657373">Well, I had to resubscribe at a higher price to get my account back but I got it back. I haven&#39;t logged in to see my characters yet though. I was still a bit irritated when I finally got it fixed.<br/>
Sony&#39;s customer service is really lacking these days. I mean, it wasn&#39;t always the best but it has really deteriorated.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I&#39;m going to talk to them when their CS opens today. I had a <br/>
&gt;problem with my mother&#39;s account and them saying she didn&#39;t have the <br/>
&gt;new expansion registered. I had to email them and complain. They <br/>
&gt;took care of it fairly quickly. Considering they might lose 4 <br/>
&gt;accounts from me, they better do something when I contact them. <br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;If they still owe you time or $$$ then contact them and sort it <br/>
&gt;out. Don&#39;t take a disabled acc. as an answer!<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;  I may be through with EQ now. I went to login to check my email <br/>
&gt;and apparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea <br/>
&gt;why. Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with <br/>
&gt;my brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not <br/>
&gt;I want to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a <br/>
&gt;higher price. I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me <br/>
&gt;off that they pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an <br/>
&gt;angry letter of complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  ARG. Just ARG!!!<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  luv,<br/>
