<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306188671">The addiction for him may not be the addiction for you.  He might be into<br/>
mastering all trade skills, getting the best equipment, hitting max level<br/>
with as many different characters as he can or he might like attending<br/>
parties, picnics and other social events.  Find your own niche and have fun.<br/>
There are over 400,000 monthly subscribers.  No matter how you like to play,<br/>
there are bound to be some other people just like that.<br/>
<br/>
The only wrong way to play EQ is to play just to pester other people.  Make<br/>
friends and feel free to ask questions.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m Danielle and I&#39;m quite new with EverQuest. It is my husband<br/>
&gt; indeed who kind of made me interested in the game on the internet as<br/>
&gt; he is very good at it and can play hours (when I say hours I mean<br/>
&gt; LOTS of hours!!!) in a row!! I saw him playing a straight 24 hours<br/>
&gt; recently.... :) So hopefully this group will help me understand the<br/>
&gt; addiction it does create!! :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Danielle<br/>
