<div id="ygrps-yiv-101643093">Rangers can solo EW to a certain extent on some of the animals <br/>
there.  Fear Kiting works wonders.  Necros can also use a similar <br/>
tact by fearing and the sending their pet in after the mob.<br/>
<br/>
While EW can be soloed, you have to be very careful of dervishes and <br/>
giants.  First off, even at level 55+ dervishes will be much lower <br/>
in level but can still hurt you plenty.  The hit hard, and can <br/>
quikcly gang up if there is more than one in the area.  The second <br/>
danger is the giants that roam.  While these guys are easily <br/>
quelmed, they also hit hard and can gang up.  If you are fighting <br/>
one of these and a dervish or two join in... well you better be a <br/>
tank with massive HP, be a necro with a pet, or have an extra pair <br/>
of shoes in the bank because you are going to be on a CR soon.<br/>
<br/>
Also, EW has one additional danger that many people do not think <br/>
about.  If you are fighting near the Kael ramp you don&#39;t want to <br/>
linger.  Hanging around the Kael ramp too long spawns the Death <br/>
Squad and these things will tear through anything that is not on <br/>
their faction.  Just a heads up.<br/>

&gt; I think if you fight in EW it&#39;s best to say near the bridge to IC <br/>
and to be<br/>
&gt; careful. there can be lots of adds. One good method I saw a druid <br/>
using was<br/>
&gt; to snare a mob then cast camo on herself and run back to the <br/>
bridge. That<br/>
&gt; way other mobs didn&#39;t see her running.<br/>
&gt; Also, if you can use the spell to charm an animal you can charm a <br/>
wolf or<br/>
&gt; kitty to help you. Only problem is when charm wears off. If things <br/>
go bad<br/>
&gt; you can run accross the bridge to zone.<br/>
&gt; I believe I hunted in DL at that lvl, but I&#39;m a cleric so I <br/>
couldn&#39;t solo.<br/>
&gt; If you have Lost Dungeons of Norrath it&#39;s really great xp. I know <br/>
you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; solo, but the xp in group is worth it.<br/>

wastes......<br/>
&gt; shes the same lvl and a dru!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok I&#39;m asking the question....I&#39;m a 46 druid...and I&#39;m wondering<br/>
&gt; &gt; where you guys would solo at this point. I was doing the kiting <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; GD on FG&#39;s..no I don&#39;t want to do the dwarf kiting.<br/>
