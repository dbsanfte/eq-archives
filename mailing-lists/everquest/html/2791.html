<div id="ygrps-yiv-920976262">My machine is maxed for memory at 256. I could not find a gforce 3 <br/>
with a pci connector. So, the 4mx was the best next choice. I will <br/>
just bear with the minor hiccups until I am ready to go for a new <br/>
system. It is really much better than before. Especially after the <br/>
tnt2 crapped out and I was stuck with my onboard graphics for a few <br/>
weeks. The present is really quite good, comparatively.<br/>
<br/>
With the benefit of hindsight, I would have gone for a more robust <br/>
system in spite of financial constraints, but the one I bought seemed <br/>
to be a sound mid-level machine at the time.<br/>
<br/>
How good does a system have to be to survive for any time in the ever <br/>
advancing world of EQ? Better than I thought last year, that is for <br/>
sure.<br/>
<br/>
There is the hope that S&V will continue to patch with retro-<br/>
compatibility in mind. I know that they won&#39;t make that a primary <br/>
purpose, but the market might not bear a constant demand for users to <br/>
upgrade. They appear to know and respond to the market, and should <br/>
have some idea just how much the gaming public will pay to play.<br/>

&gt; Get more Ram. You should have at least 512MB. I thought you said <br/>
you had a Geforce 3? That is much better than a Geforce 4 MX. I play <br/>
on 56K and that doesn&#39;t affect lag in the way you are describing.<br/>

&gt;   Finally got my card. Got it installed and went for a test drive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   One area that is a big problem is Rivervale. With the last <br/>
expansion <br/>
&gt;   Rivervale became so laggy that I avoided going home when I could. <br/>
Now <br/>
&gt;   I get a few hiccups when I enter the zone, then it settles down <br/>
to a <br/>
&gt;   playable level. A hitch now and then, but nothing like before the <br/>
&gt;   upgrade.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Checked out a few cities, some zones in between. Made technical <br/>
&gt;   adjustments. On the whole quite pleased.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   One thing I noticed was a bit of lag in laggy zones (Luclin was <br/>
&gt;   almost unplayable until now)until I had been there a bit. When I <br/>
went <br/>
&gt;   to the Bazaar I just did a slow 360 and the lag went away. Figure <br/>
&gt;   enough of the zone loaded into active memory to carry the play <br/>
from <br/>
&gt;   then on. Perhaps someone could explain what was actuall happening <br/>
to <br/>
&gt;   the system when I do this. Anyway, I do a scan of my environment <br/>
when <br/>
&gt;   I zone and things are pretty smooth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   This is my last upgrade to my present system. Have to replace my <br/>
&gt;   tower next, and hope to hold out a while. How much can I spend <br/>
every <br/>
&gt;   year on these things? The family expects me to feed them, and I <br/>
hate <br/>
&gt;   to dissppoint them too often on that account just to play my game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Now if DSL comes down a bit in price, I may try that. Could that <br/>
be <br/>
&gt;   the key to absolute smooth-as-butter-on-a-bald-monkey performance <br/>
on <br/>
&gt;   my aging machine? (The thing is just a bit over a year old. How <br/>
fast <br/>
&gt;   they grow old.)<br/>
