&gt;<br/>
&gt; My PC crashed hardcore after installing the new Win2k service pack3 and<br/>
&gt; now I think I have to send it in! Anyway I finally got my wife&#39;s computer<br/>
&gt; up and running but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t have a 3d vid card in it!<br/>
&gt; AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! I guess I won&#39;t be playing EQ for a while!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To quote my brother, &quot;That sucks a fatty&quot;.<br/>
That reminds me that not only do I have to wash the dishes today, but I have<br/>
to fix the network and have the house all straightened out before I go to<br/>
the airport to pick up my mother. I can&#39;t believe 2 weeks passed already..<br/>
luv,<br/>
