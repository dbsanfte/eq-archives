<div id="ygrps-yiv-579967758">w00t! I rock! Last night I was playing my Gnome Warrior Genmay, I had just hit lvl13, got my dual weild skill, and was hunting Minos in Ak&#39;Anon. Well I go in and pull what I think is just one out of the cave but in all reality is actually four slavers! I change to one of the wide views and realize my delima. Figuring that I would probably die before I got to the guard and even then he wouldn&#39;t be much help I decide to pull up my boots and lay into them and at least try to do as much damage as possible. I changed from my two Mino battle axes to my Graoning Mace to give me a little better chance of taking at least one, maybe two slavers out before I die. So far i&#39;m doing pretty good! I&#39;ve killed one and really wailing on another when I get attacked by a stupid giant infected rat! &quot;Oh great!&quot; I thought figuring my fate was sealed. I ignore the rat and keep wailing on the Minos. Luckily somone was nice enough to come by and kill the rat for me. By this time I was down to one bub!<br/>
ble of life left and still two Minos to go. I finish off the one I&#39;ve been working on and go right after the last one. &quot;I&#39;m dead so I might as well die with my boots on!&quot; I thought, Well suddenly the mino takes off and starts running away! &quot;Holy cow! I might make this!&quot; I take off after him and finally kill him. <br/>
So now I&#39;m standing there with a smidgen of a bubble left for life, 4 dead mino slavers and a giant diseased rat at my feet. &quot;I have just taken out 4 mino slavers!  RRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&quot; I yell. That felt so good! <br/>
