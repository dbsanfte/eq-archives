<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637281140">if you are wanting to do this just for fun be advised it will take <br/>
along time.. I have a 45 iksar beast and have not raised any <br/>
factions and with POP  it doesnt matter anymore..  Being KOS is not <br/>
the problem it use to be.. Also your religion can keep you KOS no <br/>
matter how many things you kill..  If you are doing this for fun <br/>
good luck. but its not needed .<br/>
