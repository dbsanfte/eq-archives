<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192166472">Me and My girlfriend play this on a good enough basis now, that I want to <br/>
get some better armor for her... I have decent stuff... for a lvl 18 war... <br/>
She is a lvl 17 Cleric high elf... and has a combo of Leather and Chain <br/>
mail.<br/>
<br/>
I can normally get a group of about 4 to 5 people together between friends <br/>
and was wondering also if there was good quested armor or weapons that as a <br/>
group we could do?<br/>
<br/>
everyone is close to 16 to 18... so if it&#39;s possible... could you give me <br/>
some hints maybe...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
