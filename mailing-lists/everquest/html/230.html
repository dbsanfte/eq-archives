&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve seen lots of quests listed on various web pages, and have considered<br/>
running through a few.  However, the one quest I have done was not worth the<br/>
effort, though the role-playing was fun.<br/>
<br/>
What quests are worth attempting?  And for what reason (role-playing or<br/>
financial)?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me, or do most people agree that the financial and item rewards <br/>
for quests are PITIFUL????  At least for the lower level quests this seems to <br/>
be the case.  As far as the experience points, jeez, I could get 3-4 times <br/>
the experience just killing easy mobs in a fraction of the time it takes to <br/>
complete just one quest!!  Considering how hard it is just to FIND a quest <br/>
much less COMPLETE a quest, the typical reward of a few copper and maybe a <br/>
lantern or such is REDICULOUS.<br/>
