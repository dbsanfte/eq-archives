	---------------- <br/>
	The servers will be coming down as scheduled tonight at Midnight<br/>
PDT. The following changes/bug fixes have been made. <br/>
	- Players will no longer crash when an extremely long group message<br/>
is received. <br/>
	- Added the ability to pull one item &quot;charge&quot; from a stack by<br/>
holding down the &quot;Control&quot; key when left-clicking on the stack.<br/>
	- After casting a spell at an NPC, if the target were lost before<br/>
the spell made contact, the caster would crash. <br/>
	- The &quot;/ignore&quot; command will now ignore emotes also. <br/>
	- The chat command &quot;/e&quot; will trigger &quot;/emote&quot; instead of exiting to<br/>
the character selection screen. <br/>
	- We have added new sound tracks to the Planes, Crushbone, Guk,<br/>
Mistmoore, Steamfont, and the Estate of Unrest. <br/>
	- We have reduced the amount of experience lost when dying by 50%. <br/>
	- A number of new quests have been added to various zones. <br/>
	- Magician pets (elemental) will now cast minor spells (to make up<br/>
for their lack of kick) <br/>
	- New Magician spells on vendors and some Magician spells have moved<br/>
to different vendors <br/>
	- New Magician weapons for Summon Fang & Spear of Warding & Dagger<br/>
of Symbols <br/>
	- New enchanter whirl spell (check the vendors) <br/>
	- Whirl now works on MOBS better than it did on the last patch. <br/>
	- The saving throw against Memory Blur and Atone was reduced (harder<br/>
to save against) from the last patch. <br/>
	- AC added to the Rune Series (Enchanter) <br/>
	- Alliance series works better (Enchanter) <br/>
	- Enchanter Attack Speed spells now have longer durations<br/>
(Quickness, Alacrity, etc.) <br/>
	- Tashan (the entire Enchanter series) is now quicker to cast, costs<br/>
less mana, and is harder to save against. <br/>
	- New bard songs have been added to the vendors <br/>
	- Paladins lose the spell Bravery, and gain the spell Valor <br/>
	- ShadowKnights and Necromancers gain the Word of Spirit spell<br/>
(replacing Word of Shadow for the ShadowKnight) <br/>
	- ShadowKnights lose Haunting Corpse and gain Summon Dead <br/>
	- Necromancers and ShadowKnights get a new spell - Shadow Vortex. <br/>
	- ShadowKnights lose Intensify Death (replaced by Shadow Vortex) <br/>
	- Rangers lose Shield of Barbs and gain Shield of Brambles <br/>
	- Shorter stun effects will no longer remove longer stun effects<br/>
(Bash won&#39;t get rid of whirl, for example) <br/>
	- Spell components are now stackable <br/>
	- The EverQuest Team <br/>
