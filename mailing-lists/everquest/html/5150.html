<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726109310">I think there&#39;s nowhere better than SolB for that<br/>
level.  Go in,  turn left, and learn the loop around<br/>
the well room.  I hunted with a drood in there a lot,<br/>
and it was good.  I solo&#39;d my monk there from 35 - 61.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I go solo most of the time, and prefer that style of<br/>
&gt; play. Not that I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t enjoy the social elements of the game. Just<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to depend<br/>
&gt; on groups. Kind of a loner, even in a game world. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What would be a good next step, seeking modest to<br/>
&gt; good leveling, and<br/>
&gt; good to great cash? I hunt mostly blues, as I can<br/>
&gt; take one easily, and<br/>
&gt; two with care, and three if I must (and none of them<br/>
&gt; are casters). Any<br/>
&gt; suggestions as to where I go next?<br/>
