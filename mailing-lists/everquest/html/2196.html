<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163569867">I popped into SK to try to pick up a few plat on gnolls or aviaks, <br/>
but intercepted a call for a named char location. I got it on track <br/>
and responded. I lead a group hunting a rare drop to their quarry, <br/>
and made 50pp plus in tips. Took maybe five minutes.<br/>
<br/>
A short time later I am in the tunnel mouth of ec to sell some of the <br/>
loot given as tips, when a player asked for a port. Having done very <br/>
well I felt generous, so did a free port to bb. In bb I got a call <br/>
for a wc port, party of two. Did the job. 100pp tip. Not bad at all. <br/>
My most profitable session yet. It was quite fun.<br/>
