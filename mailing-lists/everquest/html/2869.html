The zone to CC is a thing you click on inside the Rygor orc fort in EW. you<br/>
need camo/invis to get inside. The rygor orcs run with sow so they can<br/>
easily chase you down. and they stun. Very very nasty critters.<br/>

  &gt; I just hit level 30 last night, and being the Druid that I am, I had a<br/>
  &gt; couple of questions.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; First, I&#39;ve been hunting in South Karana since level 25, hunting the<br/>
Tesch<br/>
  &gt; Mas Gnolls around Paw, and perhaps have become a little spoiled, as I<br/>
have<br/>
  &gt; been getting great experience killing the yellows and whites, and<br/>
reaping<br/>
  &gt; the rewards of the loot. Now, having reached level 30, all of the gnolls<br/>
  are<br/>
  &gt; now nearing the point where hunting them isn&#39;t beneficial. Could someone<br/>
  &gt; suggest a similar zone/area with good experience and average to good<br/>
loot<br/>
  &gt; where I could hunt fairly safely, either in a group or solo?<br/>
<br/>
  You can try going inside Paw (I was actually hunting in Paw from 25 to<br/>
about<br/>
  30, altough you can hunt in Paw longer than that).<br/>
<br/>
  After that, I went to RM to hunt HGs and spent some time in Crystal<br/>
Caverns.<br/>
  I basically did 30-40 in RM, CC, OT and Eastern Wastes (with a couple<br/>
  unsuccessful trips to Tower of the Frozen Shadow).<br/>
<br/>
  I would make sure that you get as much experience dungeons as you can<br/>
  though.  LGuk and SolB (along with CC) are good places to try to find a<br/>
  group.  I did some hunting in SolA at 30, but you really need to go deep<br/>
to<br/>
  get good XP there.<br/>
