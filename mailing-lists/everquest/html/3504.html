<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422187958">Hi Rob,<br/>
	Actually it&#39;s both. I mean the more RAM you have the better and<br/>
the same goes for the video card. It sucks but that is the basics of it.<br/>
I ran some tests using CoolMon and without anything else loaded EQ alone<br/>
took 340 megs of the 512 I had in the test machine. Now I&#39;m sure that<br/>
will be different with less RAM For example, with your 384 figure EQ to<br/>
take as much of that as possible baring any other apps you may have<br/>
running in the background and what resources Windows is taking up. I<br/>
would suggest before you play to close any other apps that may be in the<br/>
system try running in the background. Even better, I don&#39;t know for sure<br/>
what OS your running but In almost all of them you can set up a version<br/>
to load at startup. I have a version of Win2k that I called GAMING which<br/>
is just the basic drivers and software I need to load and I get awesome<br/>
game play out of it. Plus I don&#39;t have to worry about other apps<br/>
conflicting with EQ. <br/>
In all honesty, your setup is fine. Just try to clear some extra RAM for<br/>
the game. <br/>

Subject: EQ video question<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a new machine and have a question.  I<br/>
had some Mouse issues but I solved those but now I get<br/>
a little skip in the movement when I run or walk.  <br/>
<br/>
It is like frame by frame.  The machine is a 1.2 GHZ<br/>
machine with 384 Ram and 32 MB video card.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my question is, &quot;Does the video card with EQ make<br/>
the difference or is it RAM?&quot;  The reason I ask is<br/>
because when you choose the Luclin images it tells you<br/>
how many to pick based on Ram and not Video memory.<br/>
<br/>
So does EQ use RAM more so than Video ram or not?<br/>
I don&#39;t mind getting a 64 MB video card but I want it<br/>
to work.<br/>
<br/>
My friend also sees the same issues but only has 256<br/>
mb ram<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
