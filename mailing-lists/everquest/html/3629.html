<div id="ygrps-yiv-836397444">Yeah. Gforce 5. With an Nvidia mobo. And 5 gigs of ram. And EQ run on <br/>
a high-speed grid. And full-body interface. And huge, affordable <br/>
bandwidth. Movie quality graphics. <br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>

&gt; Yes I am running with Luclin, with about 14 of the new models, and <br/>
the new UI. Right now I only have 256mb (Samsung DDR333 PC2700) of <br/>
memory, but I plan to increase that in the next few weeks. It came <br/>
stock with a Chaintech GF2 MX400 64MB agp card which runs quite well. <br/>
Surprised me a bit because my older system also has a GF2 MX400 in <br/>
it, but runs soooo much slower, possibly because it&#39;s a pci card I <br/>
suppose. Bus speed is still at the norm 100..possibly 133 but I don&#39;t <br/>
think so. It&#39;s an Asus P4S533 Mobo with the SiS 645dx chipset that <br/>
has gotten quite good reviews. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have noticed spell effects drag down my fps quite a bit, but <br/>
still quite playable. In a raid situation I would probably turn them <br/>
off. The bazaar is a little laggy if I don&#39;t have the clip plane <br/>
down, altho if I only have the old character models enabled I can set <br/>
the clip plane to about 50% before I get bad lag. All this, I&#39;m <br/>
assuming, is because of the video card limitations. Quite probably it <br/>
is your problem (mostly) as well. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Scanning through Pricewatch.com I noticed some pretty good prices <br/>
on the GF3 ti200 and ti500. So I will likely be going with <br/>
that....but then again the GF5s should be coming out within the next <br/>
few weeks (according to a magazine article I read) I think, and the <br/>
prices should fall even further...<br/>

&gt; &gt;hey can I ask if you have Luclin and use the new ui?<br/>
&gt; &gt;If so, can you tell me the Amount of Ram in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;system, the video ram, and the bus speed if you happen<br/>
&gt; &gt;to know it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;the reason I ask is I bought a new machine Intel<br/>
&gt; &gt;Celeron 1.2Ghz processor with over 300 MB ram and<br/>
&gt; &gt;Nvidia 32MB ram card. The game runs ok but I can&#39;t use<br/>
&gt; &gt;the new UI else I get Mouse lag or hesitation like<br/>
&gt; &gt;MAD.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And when spells are cast, the mouse is VERY slow.<br/>
&gt; &gt;the graphics are fine though and actually run smooth.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have about 15 Luclin graphic images turned on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Let me know<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks<br/>
