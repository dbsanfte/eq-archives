<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Well I finally got my new EQ2 box up and 
running.&nbsp; I know I&#39;ve mentioned it here before, but it&#39;s a Pentium 4 2.4Ghz 
CPU, 533mhz FSB, 512MB DDR PC2700 (333mhz), ATI Radeon 9600XT 256MB 4X AGP, and 
160GB 7200RPM hard drive.&nbsp; I will post pictures once I get everything 
situated.&nbsp; Got EQ2 isntalled last night and set up my UI.&nbsp; Everything 
runs fine, but I made a little oopsie.&nbsp; The video card sits very close to 
the memory slots, and little did I know that I when I tried to press the card 
into place, one of the white tabs that holds the memory into its slot was lodged 
under the video card and snapped.&nbsp; I don&#39;t knjow if I&#39;ll be able to install 
memory int hat slot, but I hope so.&nbsp; If not, I&#39;ll have to see if it&#39;s 
possible to get it fixed or replaced.&nbsp; Other than that, the machine works 
fine and is a noticeable improvement over my last system.&nbsp; I still have a 
few more things I want to add to it, but at least for right now, it&#39;s fully 
functional.</font></div>
