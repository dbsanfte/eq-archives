<div id="ygrps-yiv-713507596"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; LOL! Sounds like fun. Sorry I missed that.<br/>
&gt; What did you say to the faeries for them to give you<br/>
&gt; gifts and stuff?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nothing, just participating in the event and the GMs<br/>
picked out a few people who prominantly participated<br/>
in the fun and rewarded them. I didn&#39;t get anything<br/>
more than having levitate casted on me, but it&#39;s not<br/>
about the loot. It was a nice change of pace. :) If I<br/>
wanted loot, i&#39;d have stuck to killing Centurions and<br/>
selling belts. :)<br/>
