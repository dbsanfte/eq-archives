Tracy welcome to the world of Everquest!&nbsp; One thing I highly reccomend (and 
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll all agree with me here) is move the auto-attack button.&nbsp; I 
use the ` key since there is little chance that you&#39;ll hit it by mistake.&nbsp; 
I also suggest going to any PC gaming store and getting the Everquest Guide (the 
Kunark version since it&#39;s more in depth and focused on newbies).&nbsp; The game 
is very confusing at first but after&nbsp;several hours you get the hang of the 
game, the lingo, and whats looked down upon/whats highly accepted.&nbsp; After 
reading the guide you&#39;ll have an idea of whats going on the game..and what 
people are saying, you&#39;ll hear things like, &quot;Can I get a SoW?&nbsp; Lvl 12 pally 
LFG.&nbsp; TRAIN!&quot;&nbsp; those type of things heh heh.&nbsp; Well Tracy have fun 
learning and getting around in the world of Norrath - Happy 
Hunting!</font></span></div>

  just bought me the EverQuest Evolution today and I have <br>installed it and 
  it looks wonderful but I am having a devil of a <br>time trying to figure any
