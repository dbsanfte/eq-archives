<div><font size="2">One thing I&#39;ve noticed...it SEEMS that&nbsp; after you first 
switch into a weapon it&#39;s a couple minutes before you get any skill raises. Try 
using&nbsp; one weapon&nbsp; (or weapon set) for several hours to&nbsp; build it 
up. All of my chars use each weapon skill available to them. </font></div>

  <p>I&#39;m currently leveling up a little warrior myself. Even though it makes 
  fighting at a young age tough, I&#39;m working on all her weapon skills. As a 
  result, they are all fairly low right now. But I feel that later on it will be 
  worth it. My RL boyfriend plays a warrior as his main and at lvl 51, he&#39;s only 
  good at a couple of weapon skills. He&#39;s the one who told me to train in all 
  weapon skills since you find some nice weapons later in the game.

    I have a level 11 warrior and would like your<br>opinion on the 
    following:<br><br>I started wondering why I was not hitting that 
    much<br>with him even though he has a good weapon. After some<br>research, I 
    found that the reason I am not hitting as<br>much as others is because I 
    have been switching<br>between 2HS and 1HS weapons to increase the skills 
    of<br>each attribute.&nbsp; <br><br>Example: My skill in both is 25, let&#39;s 
    say and my<br>attack is at like 152.&nbsp; If I were to just use 
    1HS<br>let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br><br>I have 
    proved this because now that I am using the 1HS<br>more, the skill is close 
    to 30 and my ATK rating is<br>close to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is 
    still at<br>152.<br><br><br>Would you continue to alternate both weapon 
    types or<br>would you just pick one and go with 
    it?<br><br>THanks<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do
