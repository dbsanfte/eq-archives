<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584245035">Nice movie.  Very well put together.  Sad to say tho that I wish I <br/>
was at that corpse field from the raid gone bad cause thats where <br/>
necros make good money.  No other time (unless one falls into a pit) <br/>
are people gonna ask a necro for a summoning.  Those coffins are too <br/>
darn expensive :D.</div>
