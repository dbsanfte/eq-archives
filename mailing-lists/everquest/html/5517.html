There is no need to buy a compass these days since you<br/>
get the one on the screen now.<br/>
And your sense heading should be 200 or so when you<br/>
start so you always know the direction you will be in.<br/>
It does work it just does not stay pegged , it strafes<br/>
a bit.<br/>
<br/>
To improve safe fall you need to find a spot you can<br/>
fall off of and eventually you will see the skill go<br/>
up.  Keep trying, be patient.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a black racial character you need to play<br/>
an erudite.  You just can&#39;t be an Erudite Monk...<br/>
heheh<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

&gt; My questions may be redundant to those asked by<br/>
&gt; others here or even <br/>
&gt; off the wall but her goes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does any one use begging?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have built mine to 23 (not real hi I know but the<br/>
&gt; character is only <br/>
&gt; 9th level) so far all it has done is get me 2 copper<br/>
&gt; and attacked <br/>
&gt; twice.  Not good odds (one attack per copper).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why do I have direction sense?  And why would you<br/>
&gt; buy a compass?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a compass on my screen.  I already know what<br/>
&gt; direction I am <br/>
&gt; facing.  My direction sense is at 200 and it still<br/>
&gt; only works about <br/>
&gt; 60% of the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a monk, how do I improve my safe fall skill<br/>
&gt; without spending all <br/>
&gt; my points on it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I keep jumping off tall things and taking damage but<br/>
&gt; no improvement.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why are all the characters white?  What if I want to<br/>
&gt; play a black <br/>
&gt; person?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well that&#39;s about it for now.  I look foreword<br/>
&gt; (because my eyes are <br/>
&gt; in the front of my head :P ) to your answers.<br/>
