<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231201050">Kind of funny to think about, but I was watching an old episode of The<br/>
Newlywed Game on the Gameshow Network when I couldn&#39;t sleep and my wrists<br/>
hurt too much to play EQ...<br/>
The winning couple won an Apple II C with a whopping 128k of memory.<br/>
Ouch.<br/>

I think a lot of the lag comes from their code, and<br/>
not just our systems. Everquest is an old game, using<br/>
older code, and some of that code has been modified to<br/>
try and make the game graphics look like some of the<br/>
newer games.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not blaming them, they&#39;re just trying to keep up<br/>
with what the players want (better looking graphics).<br/>
It&#39;s just that the original graphic engine is too old.<br/>
:)<br/>

3 gigs of RAM and a 3 gig processor... wow, I&#39;d love<br/>
to have that, hehe.<br/>

I agree.  I think at some point there will be a massive overhaul of the<br/>
graphics in these zones that lag and change the code so it&#39;s more up to<br/>
date.  Moving to the XML GUI I think helped a lot, except now there is more<br/>
of the screen to refresh.So when they can fix that, the Bazaar will be so<br/>
much more bearable.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;d all love to have 3 gigs of RAM and a 3 gig processor!  I know I<br/>
would.  Maybe Santa will bring me one for Christmas!<br/>
