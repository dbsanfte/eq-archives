<b>Subject:</b> Re: SV: [EverQuest] Verant&#39;s new security policy.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548004325">Really? When it happened to me they didn&#39;t to jack. They didn&#39;t even answer<br/>
my petition. The offender logged off like a little pussy bc he knew the GMs<br/>
would get him.<br/>
I tried to scroll back up to get the text to show him pulling the train..<br/>
but it had been lost in all the battle messages of me getting hit, trying to<br/>
run away, asking my friend if she was ok, dying, and reloading.. Also, the<br/>
guy didn&#39;t say much when he pulled the train other than &quot;here, take it&quot;.<br/>
My friend talked to a GM who told her that since the guy logged off we<br/>
couldn&#39;t prove he was even online at the time it happened. Nor could we<br/>
prove anything without screen captures.<br/>
One thing though, if they can keep logs of guild chats, why can&#39;t they keep<br/>
logs of other stuff?<br/>
So, we were SOL.<br/>
The GM didn&#39;t even give me the kindness of letting me know that she saw my<br/>
petition. :-(<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; What is their policy in cases of harassment? Or in cases where harassment<br/>
 </span></blockquote>leads to one player purposely pulling a train of high lvl mobs onto lower<br/>
lvl characters and getting them killed on purpose just to harass one of the<br/>
lower lvl characters in that area?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; They actually take these pretty seriously.  When they receive a petition<br/>
 </span></blockquote>concerning harassment as you have described they will zone in the zone and<br/>
switch to hidden.   While hidden they can investigate the matter concealed<br/>
from view ( completely invisible, and cannot be searched via /w).  They are<br/>
to investigate the matter for evidence that can be gathered thru<br/>
observations, they will confront the aggressor and issue a warning.<br/>
Depending on the number of warnings, normally three, they will be suspended<br/>
for a week.  For a year now they have also been given the ablity to assign<br/>
information to your soulmark.  That mark will carry possitive or negative<br/>
notes concerning your account and it will follow you no matter what<br/>
character or server you reside.  That information can be viewed on/offline<br/>
to determine the best action to take.   They should also remind you to use<br/>
the /report command to save your chat window text.  That information can be<br/>
easliy accessed by the servers GM for evidence. ( they dont accept<br/>
screenshots )<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The peition itself will be relayed to the servers bulletin board at the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>end of the shift.   It will note: (a) the petitioner, (b) the accused, (c)<br/>
any information the guide was able to collect and (d) what was the outcome.<br/>
The information is posted for review by all server CS staff, keeping them<br/>
informed of daily happenings.  There are parser programs that filter the<br/>
information of a guides logs.  Can list every petition they handled.. all<br/>
their conversations.. every zone they were in.. the time it took handle each<br/>
petition.. and any notes they care to add.<br/>
