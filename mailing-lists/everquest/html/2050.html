<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364092674">The one we had was on Xmas Eve, there may have been more than one, Modazil<br/>
(yes, Modazil) spawned in Iceland conned yellow to 59 hit for about 160 he<br/>
didn&#39;t say anything just attacked anyone that got near him.  Was not too<br/>
hard and obviously controlled by a person as you could beat on him from<br/>
behind and just continue to strafe in the same direction he would try and<br/>
turn.  Before he died a bunch of people showed up and like all GM loot it<br/>
went free loot when he died and not sure who got to loot it but he dropped<br/>
Turtle Belt and 2 swords, no stats.  <br/>
