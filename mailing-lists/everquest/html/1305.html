<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628712869">Good trade.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the best thing I ever won in a random that wasn&#39;t no drop was a<br/>
Fungi Tunic.  I think there were 10 of us and we had 3 tunics.  I had the<br/>
second highest roll.  I also have lost 3 insidious robes by virtue of going<br/>
LD before we could decide who gets it. I also went LD when my Enchanter Robe<br/>
dropped in PoG but luckily my brother was in the same room with me on the<br/>
same raid and let everyone know I was coming back.  I was one of two<br/>
enchanters there and it was the other enchanters first time in PoG while I<br/>
had been there about a dozen times or so.  I  was awarded that. Once I<br/>
logged on I spent the next 3 or 4 minutes trying to loot this HUGE tree, I<br/>
couldn&#39;t find the right place to loot it (it was down by the &quot;feet&quot;, FYI).<br/>
Several times I got the message someone is already looting that corpse was<br/>
really beginning to worry.  After several /ooc /shout&#39;s finally got whoever<br/>
was crouched on the corpse to get his/her lazy tail off of it.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Since there&#39;s been a lot of talk on loot order, I<br/>
&gt; thoguht I&#39;d ask what everyone uses as a fair<br/>
 </span></blockquote>assesment for Rolling for loot or how one determines<br/>
who gets a particular item.<br/>
<br/>
The way it works on my server (C-T) is seed random<br/>
rolling.  When a mob drops something worth rolling on,<br/>
the leader of the group rolls /random 1000.  Say for<br/>
example he gets a 678 ... everyone in the group,<br/>
including the leader, then rolls /random 678.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know why we do it this way but we do :)<br/>
<br/>
The best roll coup I EVER got was for a locustlure in<br/>
Karnor Castle.  This item is worth about 7kpp on my<br/>
server, by far the best loot I&#39;ve ever seen on a mob<br/>
in my 48 levels.  I was leader of the group, so I<br/>
rolled /random 1000.  I got a 227.  So everyone rolls<br/>
/random 227 and guess what I got on that roll ..<br/>
that&#39;s right, a 227.  Talk about WOOT!!!  I was so<br/>
excited, I&#39;d NEVER won a roll before on ANYTHING. <br/>
Anyway, I traded it for Coldain Skin Boots (worth<br/>
about 12kpp) a few minutes later (didn&#39;t even have to<br/>
auction the thing), but it was still the most exciting<br/>
thing that&#39;s ever happened to me in Everquest .. ok<br/>
that&#39;s sad ..<br/>
