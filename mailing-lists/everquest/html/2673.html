<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] More women playing EQ lately? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026786256">I dunno. My sister was the one who got me into EQ in the first place. I know<br/>
quite a few guys play female characters though..<br/>
There are alot of women in my guild. Some of them are mothers. I think it&#39;s<br/>
cool.<br/>
luv,<br/>

I just noticed recently that I seem to be running into more women while<br/>
running around Norrath. I mean characters played by women, is there any<br/>
truth to this, or did I just not care in the past and didn&#39;t notice? That<br/>
would be really cool if it were true.</div>
