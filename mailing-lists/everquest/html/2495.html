<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012860698">I only recently heard about this on the radio, where a computer boffin explained how BT and other phone companies were splitting lines (Radio2 - Jimmy Young show, so fairly reliable).  He said that he had the very same problem, and that if you complain long enough and loud enough they will give you ALL of the service you are paying for.  If i had this problem i wouldnt rest until they either gave me a full line / bandwidth or reduced my line rental accordingly.  If youre paying the usual line rental charges, Sue, then dont be a fool - get onto them and say the word Solicitor as often and as loud as you can.  Bottom line - you are being scammed!<br/>

Yup. I have a special wire just for modems. Brand new. Was connecting at 24k<br/>
before. Now max is 26k.<br/>
It&#39;s because I&#39;m being a slick. Basically the phone company was lazy and<br/>
rather than giving me a full phone line, they set up a slick where they<br/>
spliced up existing lines and spread them out among houses in my area. So we<br/>
only get partial lines and low bandwidth. I talked to my ISP and they first<br/>
suggested I was behind a slick. When a repairman for my phone company came<br/>
out he confirmed that we&#39;re behind a slick. Said that the bandwidth was<br/>
within &quot;acceptible&quot; limits. When I asked the phone company about being taken<br/>
out from behind the slick they didn&#39;t know what one was. After I explained<br/>
they denied that I was behind one. I told them that I had been informed by<br/>
someone who worked on the phone lines that I was and that he even told me<br/>
the location of the slick. So I have 10 miles of spliced lines. Hell, when<br/>
they worked on my neighbors lines they turned off my caller ID, call<br/>
waiting, and disabled my main phone line for 3 days. Well, the line wasn&#39;t<br/>
working for 3 days. it kept saying it was busy bc they mixed it up with my<br/>
neighbors. the call waiting and caller ID still aren&#39;t working. I&#39;m trying<br/>
to find some type of solution to get decent lines. But I can&#39;t even get TV<br/>
out where I live-- or get my road paved. so I&#39;m probably out of luck.<br/>
Sorry for the rant.<br/>
luv,<br/>

Have you tried replacing your modem wire? The one that plugs into the wall?<br/>
They can go bad, and it&#39;s a cheap fix that can help sometimes on a &quot;noisy&quot;<br/>
line, if nothing else is really noisy (like the phone).<br/>

  &gt; there are hints about the bandwidth EQ needs on the official EQ site,<br/>
  &gt; but it is somewhat hard to find ... it is sort of information for ISPs<br/>
  &gt; so they know how much traffic within an hour or so can occur playing<br/>
  &gt; this game.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Well, when I was connecting around 40k we could have 3 people on at the<br/>
same<br/>
  time and not have lag too badly.<br/>
  but our phone lines here just suck so bad. We can barely hear over the<br/>
phone<br/>
  but the phone company keeps saying there&#39;s nothing wrong with our lines.<br/>
  Not that I&#39;m bitter mind you. ;-)<br/>
  luv,<br/>
