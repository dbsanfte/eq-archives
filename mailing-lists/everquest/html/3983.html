First, if you are SURE the elements are exactly what<br/>
you need, then you may indeed have the wrong forge. In<br/>
rivervale there are two different ones. Look on<br/>
eq.atlas.com to see how many are in that city.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the information you are getting is telling you<br/>
that it can&#39;t combine which could be the wrong items.<br/>
Make sure they are exactlt the ones you need and if<br/>
you require 2 stones let say, DON&quot;T STACK them.<br/>
Meaning don&#39;t put the stacked 2 in the slot, put one<br/>
in at a time in 2 different slots.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know how you make it, I am sure you will get it<br/>
right<br/>

&gt;    I started playing about 2 months ago and am<br/>
&gt; really enjoying <br/>
&gt; myself. But I am stuck. I use the diff. infomation<br/>
&gt; and maps you can <br/>
&gt; find on the net as well as equipment list ect to<br/>
&gt; help me find things <br/>
&gt; for quests ect. well I am stumped...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am working on a High Elf Pally and am really<br/>
&gt; enjoying building this <br/>
&gt; guy up. I started working on the Felwithe Defenders <br/>
&gt; Falchion quest. <br/>
&gt; I am 8th level and the quest is rated 10th to 15th<br/>
&gt; level.I started <br/>
&gt; the quest (talking to the Seria elf in the pally<br/>
&gt; house) I killed the <br/>
&gt; masked spy and the Gen. Orc (with the help of a<br/>
&gt; Dwarf with a Big <br/>
&gt; hammer.) (Note: the Spy and the Gen. Orc can be<br/>
&gt; found talking <br/>
&gt; together at -2096.28, 2326.77  in Greater<br/>
&gt; Faydark)and they can be <br/>
&gt; pulled with spells one at a time) I got their heads<br/>
&gt; and turned them <br/>
&gt; in to Seria and got the dull sword I&#39;m to sharpen<br/>
&gt; the sword, and turn <br/>
&gt; it in with  some arborean amber and a P.forest<br/>
&gt; drakeling scale to get <br/>
&gt; the first pally sword....well the dum sword will not<br/>
&gt; sharpen, I use 1 <br/>
&gt; and 2 sharping stones, the sword and put them in the<br/>
&gt; forge in the <br/>
&gt; armorer&#39;s shop and I&#39;m told &quot;these idems will not<br/>
&gt; combine try another <br/>
&gt; forge...WHAT other forge?? My first ? is..is there<br/>
&gt; another forge in <br/>
&gt; the high elf city and if so where or is it because I<br/>
&gt; am only 8th <br/>
&gt; level?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; my 2nd ? is on the first Pally armor quest where or<br/>
&gt; what in the name <br/>
&gt; of all the good gods can I find or what is &quot;Brick of<br/>
&gt; crude Bronze&quot; <br/>
&gt; and where can I find/make them (I need 2 for my<br/>
&gt; first peace of armor)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
