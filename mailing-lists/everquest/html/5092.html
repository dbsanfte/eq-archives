<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809346411">Yes, certain areas give you a bonus.  It applies to all experience <br/>
gained in that zone.  They&#39;re mostly dungeon type zones.<br/>

&gt; Hi, everybody.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This might be a stupid newbie question, but maybe someone might be <br/>
willing<br/>
&gt; to answer it for me: I noticed on EQAtlas.com that a few dungeon <br/>
zones are<br/>
&gt; listed as having an experience bonus (usually listed as 13% when it<br/>
&gt; applies). Can anyone tell me how this works? Or is it as I assume <br/>
and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; an XP bonus for each kill made in that zone?<br/>
