<div id="ygrps-yiv-289294343">Another way of looking at it.  Each level awards you<br/>
with 5 practice credits.  Those credits can be used<br/>
towards any available skill, to which you would like<br/>
to increase.  After you have increased your skill in<br/>
one area ( either with practice points, or earning<br/>
them fighting in the field ) there will come a time<br/>
when they will no longer train a skill for free. <br/>
Think of the Practice Credits as a chance to add to<br/>
your skill, and eventually there comes a point when<br/>
you have to pay the trainer for their services.  The<br/>
payment they would require, would therefore be noted<br/>
next to the skill.<br/>
