<div id="ygrps-yiv-496668413">Why should the people that want all these upgrades and great new features<br/>
have to suffer or do with out because a select number of the so called<br/>
&quot;value customers&quot; complain about Verant&#39;s choice to go to directx8.x? It is<br/>
not fair for the people that want to see the game grow and willing to pay<br/>
for the &quot;simple&quot; upgrades. Some might argue why should Verant spend time and<br/>
money on making the game playable for the directx7 / win95 customers when<br/>
these are the exact people that are not the best EverQuest supporters? These<br/>
directx7 / win95 customers are not supporting Verant by buying SoL and any<br/>
other expansions or games that could come out in the future. Why spend money<br/>
now accommodating these customers that won&#39;t pay for these better features<br/>
now or in the future? <br/>
<br/>
It is all about the mighty dollar, no matter what side you are looking from<br/>
and both sides must make decisions, some more costly than others.<br/>

	Yes, and maybe $265 isn&#39;t that much for you. But to some other<br/>
people that&#39;s<br/>
	a hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a<br/>
rent-to-own<br/>
	basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah, it&#39;s easy to say<br/>
they<br/>
	should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an escape for them. To<br/>
suddenly<br/>
	not be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way<br/>
Verant<br/>
	could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end not so<br/>
financially<br/>
	stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do if nothing else.<br/>
	Btw, someone mentioned where to get good RAM for cheap? Where was<br/>
that<br/>
	again? I just found out my comp can have up to 1Ghz of RAM with it&#39;s<br/>
	motherboard and chipset.<br/>
