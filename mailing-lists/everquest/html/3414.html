<div id="ygrps-yiv-330889938">Oh yeah. I got ya. Yeah, there have been some people constantly bitching in<br/>
EC about how EC is dead and blah blah blah. Carrying on about why people<br/>
aren&#39;t selling there anymore and stuff. I personally like having less people<br/>
there spamming for sales. Made it easier to sell my Ring of the Frost<br/>
Spiders (btw, I found that actually advertising the stats of the item got<br/>
instant attention-- one guy was trying to sell the same item but not saying<br/>
the stats. I advertised it just to show the stats for him and immediately<br/>
got tells from people who wanted it).<br/>
I wonder what Planes of Power is going to do in terms of clearing out the<br/>
zones..<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; have during game play, that comment was mostly meant for them.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a new thing so yea people are going to flock to it. I personally<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t been there yet. I was told you need the Luclin expansion for it.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t have that one, heck I just picked up the Ruins expan yesterday!<br/>
&gt; Lol!<br/>
&gt; I have to admit I personally am enjoying the little amount of people in<br/>
&gt; the game, I&#39;m getting a hold of a lot of great stuff and making some<br/>
&gt; decent plat amounts. I&#39;ve been able to get all the items I need for my<br/>
&gt; quests and so forth. Today I was surprised and happy to see a few people<br/>
&gt; running around in Steamfront.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway back to my quests!<br/>
