&gt; Was just running my Halfling Warrior lvl 10 around East Commons. Some <br/>
&gt; very interesting new stuff since the last patch(s). Killed a <br/>
&gt; woodlands lion and got five items. The usual skins and meat, plus a <br/>
&gt; mane and a malted lions skin. Never seen a mane before, but the <br/>
&gt; malted is absolutely new to me. Anyone know what these are for?<br/>
<br/>
