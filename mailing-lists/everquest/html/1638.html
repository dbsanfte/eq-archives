<div id="ygrps-yiv-176949848"><html><div>Would you want to see every level 1 cleric in G Fay running around with full Skyshrine armor and a cleric epic?&nbsp; Because that, for example, will happen if the scammers heard that Verant will take their word for it that their account was hacked and they had all this great stuff on their cleric, and they also had a ranger with all his epic/quest stuff, and a warrior with a Wurmslayer .. when does it end?</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Say: Well, Verant will have to take a look at that account to see if that stuff was actually on those characters on the account.&nbsp; Uh, wrong.&nbsp; Verant can&#39;t trust that kind of thing to a volunteer Guide, so the paid GM&#39;s would have to do it.&nbsp; Any idea how long it would take for a GM to investigate a hacked account to make sure the account&#39;s characters actually had that stuff?&nbsp; Not to mention that the hacker would have given away to his own characters the lewt, if it was there (and wasn&#39;t no drop - and I hear there are hacking programs that make no-drop items droppable, although I think that&#39;s disgusting).</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Then what happens when the hacker hacks into the account, but doesn&#39;t play it for two or three weeks so the heat&#39;s off?&nbsp; The GM is supposed to wait three weeks constantly checking for the account to be online?</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>This is Verant&#39;s reasoning, and I understand it.&nbsp; They can&#39;t have all these people on the payroll just to investigate these supposed hacked accounts.&nbsp; Also, you and I both know that a million and one scammers would come out of the woodwork talking about all the phat lewt they had on their characters.&nbsp; Scammers ruin the game, in my humble opinion.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen too many damn scams to trust anyone in the game I don&#39;t know in RL.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>It is ridiculous, in my eyes, to have them policing this.&nbsp; And, as has already been mentioned, most &quot;hacked&quot; accounts are a result of someone handing out their password to a &quot;trusted&quot; source.&nbsp; My ex-fiance knew my password, doesn&#39;t any more.&nbsp; It&#39;s only smart to change your password every few days.&nbsp; /shrug</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Nymue</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote style="BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;"> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;">----- Original Message -----</div> <div style="BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;COLOR:black;FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>From:</b> Paul Martin</div> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>Sent:</b> Thursday, June 14, 2001 11:52 AM</div> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>To:</b> EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</div> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>Subject:</b> Re: SV: [EverQuest] Verant&#39;s new security policy..</div> <div>&nbsp;</div>My question is, why can&#39;t V simply transfer my stuff from my hacked account<br>to a new account that I create?? The attitude of you just get banned and<br>lose everything that you&#39;ve worked hard for PERIOD really is a poor customer<br>service attitude for something that we pay monthly to do.<br>_________________________________________________________________<br>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com<br><br><br>Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br><br><br>Your use of Yahoo!
