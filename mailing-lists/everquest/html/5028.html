<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998036420"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; One problem with the war is it can screw up the zone until the server<br/>
&gt; is reset.  They have patched it but it still breaks, though less<br/>
&gt; often.  But it is fun!<br/>
&gt; If you want to increase your brewing cheaply just gather Payala fruit<br/>
&gt; in Shadeweaver Thicket and combine it with water.  It&#39;s a ground drop<br/>
&gt; so anyone can find it.  Just look for the blue topped trees.  It<br/>
&gt; makes Shar Val essence, triv at 180+.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. Got my brewing to 184 so far. :-)<br/>
A couple months ago I practiced going around the trees in the zone and got<br/>
it down so that by the time I got back to the starting point the fruit<br/>
repopped. Got lots of lots of the payala fruit.<br/>
Is Shar Vahl essence good for anything? I have tons of it.<br/>
luv,<br/>
