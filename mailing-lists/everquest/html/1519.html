me?&quot;&nbsp; Then when you tell them sorry you cant you will begin to see the true 
colors of some people when they skip asking or explaining why they thought you 
could and go right to cursing and spaming you.&nbsp; Quite funny, but can raise 
the old blood pressure a bit if you dont take it in stride.</span></font></div>

  money problem<br><br></font></div><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size="2">I 
  thought it asked you that also, but I noticed the last couple times I was 
  <br>fighing and encumbered in SK and went to drop the copper I had that it 
  didn&#39;t <br>ask me if I wanted to so maybe they changed it. &nbsp;My new 
  favorite illusion. &nbsp; <br>The skeleton illusion. &nbsp;I have put that 
  illusion on and walked around the FP <br>end of EC near the newbies...OMG it 
  was funny. &nbsp;My husband and I had the best <br>laughs watching this one 
  dude RUN from me. &nbsp;When he finally stopped after <br>like 2 minutes of me 
  chasing him, I asked if I scared him and he realized I <br>wasn&#39;t a real 
  skeleton and he said yes I conned red to him and he thought I <br>was going to 
  kill him. &nbsp;I told him I only wanted to give him haste and then I 
  <br>buffed him and left. &nbsp;LOL. &nbsp;It&#39;s also funny when people send 
  their pets to <br>fight me and then the pets say that&#39;s not a legal target 
  master and the <br>person is trying to figure out why. &nbsp;Or when I&#39;m 
  medding in skellie form and <br>they try to loot my bones...LOL. &nbsp;This is 
  why I love my enchanter. <br><br>Lena <br><br><br>

    Heh. looking <br>like PP is funny. :-) <br>That reminds me, isn&#39;t the game 
    supposed to ask you if you want to drop your <br>money when you are clicking 
    it over something? Bc I tried to trade money <br>with someone once and it 
    didn&#39;t trade but the money was gone. The person <br>informed me that I had 
    dropped it on the ground. I had not meant to drop it <br>and it didn&#39;t ask 
    me if I wanted to.. Was that a glitch? <br>luv, <br>-Su</blockquote></font><font
