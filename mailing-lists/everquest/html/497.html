&lt;&lt; I am planning on making a shaman and I was wondering which you all think <br/>
is the best. I want a race that will be the strongest at higher levels, not <br/>
necessarily right away. Also if you could provide reasons it would help me <br/>
even more. Thanks for your time.<br/>

were Me I&#39;d do a barbarian.  While all races have advantages and <br/>
disadvantages, it is very important to know that Trolls and Ogres have a very <br/>
hard time getting into cities and crossing zones with guards from good races. <br/>
 While I have played both an Erudite Wizard and a Barbarian Warrior - the <br/>
race/class combo I like the most is the Barbarian Shaman.  Shaman&#39;s are great <br/>
because:<br/>
<br/>
They got the single best spell in the game in my opinion which is Spirit of <br/>
Wolf (SOW)<br/>
can summon food and water<br/>
can bind and gate<br/>
great buff spells<br/>
decent melee fighters for having pretty good damage spells<br/>
Great healing spells<br/>
