<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i think &quot;fighter&quot; classes won&#39;t be too happy about horses (the only<br/>
exception are the lvl 60 pallies and sks: summon horse as skill).<br/>
<br/>
my mage and cleric have horses, because of the following reasons:<br/>
 - better mana regen than standing<br/>
 - less aggro (you are sort of standing not sitting)<br/>
 - cast and mem other spells without sitting down, standing up<br/>
<br/>
especially if you are in a raid situation (45+ zones, especially planes)<br/>
it is better to be on horse, because you can&#39;t sit down to mem another<br/>
spell without getting aggro. the better mana regen rate really kicks in<br/>
when you also have C3. so you can really say, horses (or mounts) are<br/>
sort of a must for spell users doing raids.<br/>
<br/>
the main problems with horses:<br/>
 - non-small races on horses are large... very large... a shrink is a must<br/>
   in raid situiations when there isn&#39;t much room<br/>
 - small races on horses (like gnomes) look pretty stupid! a mounted<br/>
   gnome can ride between the legs of a mounted troll without &quot;ducking&quot;.<br/>
 - you can&#39;t duck ... and moving to interrupt a spell isn&#39;t that nice/easy<br/>
 - moving/targeting/looting has to be &quot;learned&quot;... it is sort of clumsy and<br/>
   you have to get used to it<br/>
 (- there were bugs where mounted people couldn&#39;t be healed)<br/>
<br/>
in non-raid situations, i prefer jboots to horses: instant click; horses<br/>
take<br/>
some time to get summoned (and you can get interrupted).<br/>
<br/>
necros can use their skelly form on a horse, but i don&#39;t think druids<br/>
can change into wolf form, but i am not sure about that.<br/>
