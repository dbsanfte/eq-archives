<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090788833">Oops. I meant that as a private message to someone... LOL. I forgot that it was in response to a private message sent from the list.. D&#39;oh!!!<br/>
Anyways, I was angry and I still haven&#39;t gotten ahold of them. When I logged on a different account and said something to the GM they just said &quot;contact tech support&quot;. Tech support was closed at the time. UGH.<br/>
So I&#39;m still trying to decide whether or not to renew... Gonna have to wait til they open today to contact them.<br/>
How many people has this happened to? Did they delete your characters? If they deleted anything on mine I&#39;m cancelling all of my accounts bc it&#39;s just not worth it to do all that work again. UGH.<br/>
Must.. wait..  I must calm down and be rational first. It just pisses me off, yaknow?<br/>
luv,<br/>

I went to login to check my email and apparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea why. Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with my brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not I want to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a higher price. I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me off that they pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an angry letter of complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>
&gt;ARG. Just ARG!!!<br/>
