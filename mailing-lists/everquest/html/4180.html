<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330795370">Yes they do.<br/>
I have a 39 level druid and for fun I walk over to<br/>
them , round them up, run to the other location gather<br/>
them up and then once I have them all in the area, I<br/>
cast earthquake, watch them all get pummeled and then<br/>
I shout  rats to loot with the loc to all NEWBS.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a while to get them but yes they do drop<br/>
them.<br/>
A few guildees have made the full set with not much<br/>
trouble. usually within a week .<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
<br/>
What server you  on?<br/>
Maybe I can nuke a few for ya......lol<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just started a Halfling Druid named Pistashio and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m somewhat working on the newbie armor quest. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; having trouble with part of it that requires Mossy<br/>
&gt; Rat Pelts. I have obtained several Ruined and<br/>
&gt; undamaged rat pelts but no plain ol&#39; mossy. All the<br/>
&gt; research I have done seems to suggest the diseased<br/>
&gt; rats drop these so I have been hunting them for<br/>
&gt; about a week now and no pelts. Does anyone know if<br/>
&gt; they do drop them, if they are rare, no-drop and<br/>
&gt; such? Any info would be greatly appriciated. :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
