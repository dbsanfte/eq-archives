<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507409722">One of the best boosts to my tailoring skills came in East Karana. I <br/>
think they were craig spiders. Whatever their names, they were large <br/>
and red and black. Dropped lots of silk. Made lots of silk stuff. I <br/>
was gaining experience at the time as well, so found it all the more <br/>
satisfying. Plus, the weight of spider silk and the silk stuff I made <br/>
was not all that much, so I did a lot of tailoring in the field. Not <br/>
so easy to do that with heavy hides.<br/>
