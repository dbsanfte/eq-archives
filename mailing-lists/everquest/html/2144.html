<div id="ygrps-yiv-523028981">Thanks for all the tips, links and advice. I&#39;m going to follow that <br/>
guide and start making myself some coverings and see about selling <br/>
some also.<br/>
<br/>
My pc is Electa, Shadow Knight, Human - Lvl 3 roaming Freeport and <br/>
East Commonlands at the moment on Tribunal. No Guild.  I&#39;m studying <br/>
in the tunnels beneath Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
With the exception of getting dismantled by a Lion and Bear attacking <br/>
me, with no provoking on my part - its been cool. But if there is a <br/>
better place a Shadow Knight of this low level could find kills or <br/>
what time of guild I should be looking at - I&#39;m very open to advice!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
DLG<br/>

&gt; Where are you hunting?<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re in Gfay area I can probably help you out sometime. A cool <br/>
thing to<br/>
&gt; do is collect crushbone belts and turn them in. You get some <br/>
patchwork armor<br/>
&gt; that you can wear. It&#39;s cruddy, but it&#39;s a start.<br/>
&gt; Basically kill critters til you get armor. When you start hunting <br/>
higher<br/>
&gt; level mobs they start dropping more coin.<br/>
&gt; Most of my characters are on the Tribunal.<br/>
&gt; You can contact Elzeria, Damita, and Tiladanu (I know I&#39;m missing <br/>
some but<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t remember their names right now).<br/>
&gt; What class and race? In a guild yet?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello All<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know I&#39;m about 20 years late, but I&#39;m making that transition <br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ultima Online and MUD to EQ.  I&#39;ve been enjoying it so far on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tribunal Server. THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE! Leveling is pretty balance.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Plenty of helpful players!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just looking for advice on how to get more money.  A player <br/>
gave<br/>
&gt; &gt; me a sweet sword does high damage, but other than that I&#39;m naked.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>
&gt; &gt; DLG<br/>
