&gt;That is true for higher level characters.  But if you are a newbie, &gt;its <br/>
&gt;not true.  At least for the Tome of Discord.  I&#39;d put it in the &gt;bank, but <br/>
&gt;it appeared after I died and got reborn and a message that &gt;said &quot;duplicate <br/>
&gt;lore item in bank deleted.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When you have a new character, everytime you die you get the Tome of Discord <br/>
back, (up until 5th level I believe; not sure which level) as well as your <br/>
starting items (food, drink, weapon and lightsource if you had one). But you <br/>
CAN NOT have more than one item that&#39;s lore either on yourself and in the <br/>
bank - hence the message you got &quot;duplicate lore item in bank deleted&quot; - the <br/>
one you had in the bank was detected as a duplicate lore item, and was <br/>
deleted by the server.</div>
