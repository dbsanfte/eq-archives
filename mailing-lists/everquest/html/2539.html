<div id="ygrps-yiv-126436331">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
As a result of me quitting EQ I have handed over the ownership of this<br/>
mailing list to Su, she seems like a reasonable person to carry on, even<br/>
tho there isn&#39;t really much this list has required in the ways of<br/>
maintenance.. I have barely done jack here since I started it back<br/>
during beta.. :p However i did restrict access to the calendar now and<br/>
removed that annoying spam event thing hehe...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck everyone!<br/>
