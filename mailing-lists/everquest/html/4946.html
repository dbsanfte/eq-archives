&gt; Me and my friend were having a discussion the other night while he<br/>
&gt; was playing eq, he was talking to his eq wife, and i was messing<br/>
&gt; with him, and if brought up the questions of, are there really girls<br/>
&gt; that play eq, or are the all guys. Then he asked me, if there are<br/>
&gt; girls that play, are they cute? Just curious.<br/>
