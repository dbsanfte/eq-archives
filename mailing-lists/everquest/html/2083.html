Yeah, it&#39;s always wise to choose your groups carefully. If you notice a bad<br/>
pattern-- like the main puller pulling nonstop and not giving you time to<br/>
med, make sure you tell them to stop pulling. If they don&#39;t listen, that&#39;s<br/>
when you leave.<br/>
I had trouble in group last night bc after my bro (the main tank) logged<br/>
off, our new tank went and pulled when I said I was AFK and not to pull. I<br/>
was the main healer. When I came back my mother was sitting in my chair<br/>
shrieking about how she couldn&#39;t heal people. She blocked my keyboard with<br/>
her hands and I couldnt&#39; see the screen. Turned out I was still sitting. I<br/>
managed to reach over and stand up but she swatted my hands away and started<br/>
casting heal-- on the mobs. Wasted most of my mana. I finally got her to<br/>
move her fat ass out of my chair and got to my keyboard but it was too late.<br/>
I managed to get off a couple heals on the druid but then went oom and<br/>
couldn&#39;t save myself. I should have gated but I didn&#39;t want to ditch the<br/>
others. I didn&#39;t realize they said it was ok to zone. Big mistake. I ended<br/>
up dead. Fortunately they found a high lvl cleric to rez me and I got back<br/>
more xp than I&#39;d remembered having.<br/>
Don&#39;t mind me. Just felt like sharing. I was mad at my mom at first but she<br/>
was only trying to help. It&#39;s kinda funny in retrospect.<br/>
luv,<br/>

Appreciate the response but I was hunting with others, no one I know<br/>
personally, and when I died I figured to just go back, but when I got back<br/>
my corspe was gone.  I had 2 orc centurions on me and none of  them helped<br/>
at that point,<br/>
<br/>
So, I learnt a good lesson, don&#39;t go with others if you can&#39;t handle the<br/>
stuff yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

  If you die at levels below 5 you should resurrect with five days of<br/>
  food and water. If your corpse had nothing on it, it may have<br/>
  disappeared, but your own anwswer is most likely. You misplaced your<br/>
  corpse. Dying at levels below five is set to be low-penalty (you lose<br/>
  very little and get food and water when you come back) to make the<br/>
  early learning a bit easier.<br/>
<br/>
  There are tools to find corpses, sold by merchants. However, it is<br/>
  best to learn to die with finding your corpse in mind. Try to look<br/>
  around at landmarks when death is clearly coming. Try to be near some<br/>
  object you can find easily when you come back. And unless you don&#39;t<br/>
  mind having to do this often, learn to fight in such a way as to<br/>
  seldom die. Some gamers like to take the risks leading to frequent<br/>
  deaths, but I prefer to hunt with care and die seldom. Seems more in<br/>
  the spirit of the game to me.<br/>
<br/>
  Good hunting to you.<br/>

  &gt; Hi all,<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th level Druid in the<br/>
  city of Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, with others, I got<br/>
  killed by an Orc Centurian and when I returned to get my corpse,<br/>
  nothing was there.  It was not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my corpse?<br/>
  The book says no but I beg to differ.<br/>
  &gt; Is it possible that I had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I<br/>
  went back with a dead body I died again?  Which meant I found the<br/>
  wrong corpse?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have<br/>
  no food, no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I beg or do I start another char?<br/>
  &gt; This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to learn which<br/>
  way to go all the time and dying, it is starting to get to me,<br/>
  &gt; I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since<br/>
  the Chat from the game options was USELESS.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>
