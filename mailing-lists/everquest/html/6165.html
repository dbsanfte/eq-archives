<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038188890">Good Goddess... do you realize how much better shape myself and so many <br/>
other people would be in if we actually had to wear VR suits and swing <br/>
our arms to use swords and axes and such, and walk in place to move, <br/>
and jump to avoid baddies, and talk out loud for people to hear us in <br/>
groups.  Some of us might be in a shape other than round for a change.<br/>
<br/>
Of course also imagine the chaos at raids.  It is already bad enough <br/>
getting 72 people to shut up long enough to listen to or give our raid <br/>
commands to be executed while taking on something even as simple as <br/>
Rallos Zek, let alone whatever mobs we would be fighting in 25 years <br/>
wearing VR suits.<br/>
<br/>
Of course my biggest aversion to wearing VR suits while playing a game <br/>
like EverQuest... getting the urine stains out of the VR suit when <br/>
coming face to face with something that is 10 times your size, snarling <br/>
at you while dripping saliva off its razor sharp teeth and knowing that <br/>
it has one purpose in its life... to teach warriors how to taunt a mob <br/>
off us Weapon Shield Rangers before we rangers end up as toe jam and <br/>
something disgusting between its teeth.<br/>

&gt; LOL the whole discussion of 25 years from now in EQ land got me <br/>
&gt; thinking lol. I hope if by some scary chance EQ is around in 25 <br/>
years, <br/>
&gt; that it would be very cool..more than it is now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I see us wearing the &quot;VR Suit&quot; instead of using a keyboard. With it <br/>
&gt; you would feel it when an orc knocked you on your arse...and all <br/>
&gt; movements would respond, like (if my understanding is correct) they <br/>
do <br/>
&gt; with digital animation for movies and such. You make a sword slashing <br/>
&gt; move, and your toon does....etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hell, if they&#39;d add that now, lol I&#39;d be there. I magine the workout <br/>
&gt; one would get after playing EQ...lol<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a moronic thought...Greg </span></blockquote></div>
