<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035480900"><p>I have a lv 32 SK and a lv 29 Enchanter. It drives me nuts to chose between them and have thought to delete one. Instead, I was thinking I would trade my account for someone that has a single lv 30ish. My account is on the Nameless server and I am looking for one there. </p><p><br><hr size="1"><b>Do You Yahoo!?</b><br>
