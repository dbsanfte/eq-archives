<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308165621">Jagged Pine has some nice drops, especially for rangers and druids.  <br/>
But one warning about JP is that some of the gnolls there are <br/>
casters and can wreck your day quickly.  Also there is not a lot of <br/>
room to kite there, so it is mainly rangers you ever see there.<br/>
<br/>
For druids at 46 I am sorry to say that other than GD, EW, <br/>
and &quot;maybe&quot; PoD, your kiting days for solo are just about over.  <br/>
Time to get a group and have some fun.<br/>

&gt; I think Jaggedpine is actually attached to surefall glade. so if <br/>
you are kos<br/>
&gt; in surefall you need to be careful. Also, even with a good <br/>
graphics card it<br/>
&gt; can be fairly laggy there because of the type of graphics. I hear <br/>
there are<br/>
&gt; some cool things that drop there though. Eye of the Griffon drops <br/>
there.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s +10 wisdom but -20 charisma, range slot item.<br/>

&gt;   Ok I&#39;m asking the question....I&#39;m a 46 druid...and I&#39;m wondering<br/>
&gt;   where you guys would solo at this point.  I was doing the kiting <br/>
in<br/>
&gt;   GD on FG&#39;s..no I don&#39;t want to do the dwarf kiting.<br/>
