<div id="ygrps-yiv-319851275">In my opinion, for the high end game, go for Ogre Shadow Knight.<br/>
<br/>
Sk&#39;s get a line of spells that allow you to build up major agro very<br/>
quickly. Plus they get one of the best dropable Swords in the game, the<br/>
Black Bastardsword. Damage 40, delay 38, with better stats than the sk epic<br/>
and an amaizing proc for an MT, check it out at alakazham<br/>

<br/>
As for race, I would say ogre, for the simple reason that Ogres cannot be<br/>
stunned from the front, which on big mobs can make a lot of difference.<br/>
Their low int doesn&#39;t really matter at the high end as this can be fixed<br/>
with gear and aa&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Just my humble opinion =)<br/>
