	There are a couple of solutions with this. I have the same problem<br/>
when I log on and end up having to log off and relog with 2 characters<br/>
when I have friends that are on. <br/>
<br/>
	One solution is ICQ. I know it sucks and if your friends do not use<br/>
it then this point is moot. But if everyone uses it, you can check to see<br/>
if your friends are on-line.<br/>
<br/>
	Second, there is a program that has just been released and is in <br/>
beta called EverGuild. It is by the same person that does the EverMon<br/>
program and is supposed to be able to let you know when each person<br/>
on you list (configurable) is on-line. This is all done before launching EQ<br/>
so you will know if someone is on-line or not. As the name applies it was<br/>
basically for Guilds, but as it stands right now you can monitor for Users,<br/>
Characters and Guilds. So believe this will be a very handy asset. Again,<br/>
I believe the people that you want to see if they are on-line, must be running<br/>
the program also, but not for sure, As I just got the EverGuild program this<br/>
morning and haven&#39;t had a chance to check it out completely. But looks <br/>
very promising.<br/>
<br/>
	Your suggestion is very good, but in the mean time, you may want<br/>
to check out these alternatives. Hope this helps. BTW the links to the <br/>
above two choices are listed below.<br/>

&gt;Ok, back to an EQ topic....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was just wondering what people thought about this. I have a couple<br/>
&gt;characters (Mithe on Cathic-Thule and another druid there). Everytime I<br/>
&gt;get to that character selection screen I debate, should I play my ranger<br/>
&gt;or druid. If I play the druid I will greatly fall behind my friends that<br/>
&gt;only play one character. To solve this I&#39;d love to see /who friends<br/>
&gt;available from the character selection or server selection screen that<br/>
&gt;way i could tell who was on and on which server. Say I click on<br/>
&gt;Cathic-Thule and see my high level friends are not on I could decide to<br/>
&gt;start a new character on PVP server etc...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me know what you think. If you agree petition or suggest this when<br/>
&gt;online.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thanks </span></blockquote></div>
