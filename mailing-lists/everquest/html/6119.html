<div id="ygrps-yiv-495375286">In response to the baking tradeskill question...<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the stat food that gives you increased stats when the <br/>
food is in your first food / drink slots, some quests require you to <br/>
have tradeskills a certain level in order to do the quest.  Examples <br/>
of these quests are the Coldain Shawls (Luclin Expansion) and Aid <br/>
Grimel (PoP Expansion).  Baking is a fun tradeskill because you can <br/>
make food for parties like wedding cake and other &#39;interesting&#39; food <br/>
like Batwing Crunchies and Edible Goo.</div>
