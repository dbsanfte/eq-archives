&gt; We have this kinder, gentler guild on Povar server called Royal <br/>
Order <br/>
&gt; of Norrath (www.royalorderofnorrath.com) if you ever want to go to <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; new server. We are sort of a training guild in many ways. We have <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; relationship with a raiding guild for those in their high 50s+ <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; want to do the hard core raids.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I am looking for a strong active guild.  I thought I had found <br/>
one.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;It had many players they were on all the time and helped out.  <br/>
But <br/>
&gt; &gt;they have had many players leave the guild or leave the server, <br/>
even <br/>
&gt; &gt;the officers.  I would like a supportive guild who do things <br/>
&gt; &gt;together on more than a rare occasion and do not mind a semi <br/>
&gt; &gt;newbie.  Even a small guild but who do things and are on more <br/>
than <br/>
&gt; &gt;once a month.<br/>

&gt; &gt;thanks,<br/>
