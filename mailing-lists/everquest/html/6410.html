<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201345556">4/1/99 here.  What sticks out in my mind from then was<br/>
seeing EC really crowded with lowbies trying to hunt. <br/>
A 40 char was rare, so when giants and griffs spawned<br/>
the whole zone would be running around trying to avoid<br/>
it, and if it got you you were insta killed.  I<br/>
remember the first time I saw one go down the whole<br/>
zone of lowbies were around it hitting it to go down. <br/>
I was amazed that it could even be killed.<br/>
<br/>
People would fight over orc spawns and stuff.  It was<br/>
funny, but bad for a monk because droods and bards<br/>
always got to them first.<br/>
<br/>
Then it was the same with Oasis, HK, EK/WK.<br/>
<br/>
Guilds would race to get the next Naggy spawn.  Naggy<br/>
raids were fun.  <br/>
<br/>
This was also before the time when anyone had figured<br/>
out &quot;role based&quot; grouping so there was no such thing<br/>
as the big three (tank/cleric/slower).  I was once in<br/>
a group in Paw with 6 monks.  Now that was fun!<br/>
<br/>
This was also before Sony gimped monks so we were THE<br/>
solo class.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being proud when I could do three digit<br/>
damage in a round.  <br/>
<br/>
I might dink around on a classic server, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think there&#39;s any getting the old days back.  I&#39;m<br/>
still enjoying pushing the envelope on my monk (level<br/>
70, ~100 AA&#39;S) so lots of growth to do there.  I&#39;m<br/>
also doing tradeskills and only have 9 points to go to<br/>
get blacksmithing to 200, and then 42 to get tailoring<br/>
to 200, and the rest are already 200 or more.<br/>

&gt;  I&#39;d love to try it to get the feel of what everyone<br/>
&gt; went through before the expansions.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
&gt; excellent stories from friends who&#39;ve played since<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; beginning, when dropping your first giant would<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; mean something. Just seems it would be a good idea<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; get first had experience of the history in this<br/>
&gt; game.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey Kids...Been gone awhile...been busy..<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, in talking to my old EQ chums and with<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; I read on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; websites, there is/has been some talk about SOE<br/>
&gt; &gt; making a &quot;classic&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; server.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now the &quot;classic&quot; server would be EQ prior to PoP,<br/>
&gt; &gt; no adds or toys, <br/>
&gt; &gt; with the exception of the stuff necessary. This<br/>
&gt; &gt; would mean no PoK, no <br/>
&gt; &gt; Guild Lobby, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Knowing that many of you have been here since<br/>
&gt; around<br/>
&gt; &gt; Beta or just after <br/>
&gt; &gt; and that most of you can honestly say &quot; I remember<br/>
&gt; &gt; when... or Back in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the Day we had to run from X t Y and it was 4 day<br/>
&gt; &gt; run....&quot;; I am <br/>
&gt; &gt; curious to know if any of you kids would use such<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; server, or have you <br/>
&gt; &gt; all become stuck on how things are now that going<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to the old way <br/>
&gt; &gt; would kill the game for you?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As always, but now just plainly nosey..<br/>
