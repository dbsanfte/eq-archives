<div>As a lvl 70 Shaman&nbsp; I tend to change out where I wanna go depending on 
how bad I want something (i.e.&nbsp; NRo/EC LDoNs for Bane and RGC, 
Anywhere&nbsp;I can go&nbsp; for 69/70 runes (still missing 2 69/all 70 
runes),RS and MPG for aaxp(Waay behind on a lot of the needed aaxp points for my 
level (Gimp Barb Shammy with 126 aa including the 1 unspent aa atm)), DoNs(All 
good Faction ones that will get me the radiants i need for mana pres 5 aug (Just 
got the EE5 one last week) And still the only one in my guild who has all the 
flags needed to get into Sol Ro Tower the old way and not via the alternate 
means( 2 mini&#39;s and a Sol Ro kill from being Fire Flagged and not be gimped into 
Fire)) There are still parts of every expansion&nbsp;I have yet to see with Haly 
and if I ever do see &#39;em kewl, if not just as kewl. In the immortal words of 
Michael Valentine Smith &quot;Waiting Is&quot; and I grok I will see those zones when it 
is time for me to see them.&nbsp; Then there are the zones that I haven&#39;t 
visited in so farging long that I do have to ask fellow guildies which way to go 
even with the New Atlas feature lol.&nbsp; For me however Playing EQ is my way 
of relaxing from the 6 day work week I have (ok admittedly it actually turns out 
to be 5 days since Fridays and Saturdays are half days for me but I still have 
to be there at like 830 am Every day with Mon through Thursday being there till 
830 at night Fri and Sat only till about 1 or 3 depending on how far behind the 
techs are in their routes) But Eq for me doesn&#39;t mean raid everytime i get 
online nor does it mean for me to constantly be doing something&nbsp; for my 
char its also one of the ways i socialize when I&#39;m not out of the house&nbsp; 
and not at work as of late due to my work schedule So I&#39;m seriously not looking 
to be as ubah as some of my Shaman brethren are out there in EQ but if I&#39;m given 
the opportunity to get something that&nbsp; is a kewl upgrade and I&#39;m not 
involved with a guild thing then heck yeah I&#39;m there as fast as my barbarian 
feet (With sow of course)&nbsp;can get me there =)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But I&#39;ve played EQ literally since Just after Velious came out with my 
original main Cynfyn (lvl 52 DE SK), and with all the stuff that has come out 
since I began my EQ experience and any future stuff SoE decides to add&nbsp; 
I&#39;ll be quite happy to play EQ until SoE officially pulls the plug on it and 
decides that EQ is gone the way of the Dinosaur,</div>

<div>Sorry for making a dissertation out of my response&nbsp; but what 
can&nbsp;I say? I tend to be long winded at times as Wulfric can attest to. (or 
am I mistaken Wulf?)</div>
