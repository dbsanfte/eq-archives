<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732258327">I tried to get some tasks with my 65 cleric but all of the &quot;short&quot; tasks started in sebilis. I don&#39;t like working my way to sebilis. And I know I can&#39;t solo the mobs there. I think we should feedback and request they have some tasks that actually ARE soloable.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I&#39;ve now got a couple of my characters working on tasks. My 49 ranger was<br/>
&gt;advised by the task masters to go to Rathe Mountains for a task. I did, and<br/>
&gt;everything was pointing me to Lower Guk. I&#39;ve never really been through<br/>
&gt;Upper and Lower Guk, and going that far underground with a ranger just makes<br/>
&gt;me concerned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I abandoned the task. The next thing I tried was getting a task from a task<br/>
&gt;master in Overthere. It sent me into Burning Woods, where one of the things<br/>
&gt;I had to do was enter the giant fort and scout it out. To accomplish that, I<br/>
&gt;discovered I had to run into the middle of the fort. I was invisible, but as<br/>
&gt;soon as I got within agrro range, I started wailed on by a giant.<br/>
&gt;Thankfully, a group was pulling giants from the fort, so it was somewhat<br/>
&gt;abandoned. I trained a giant or two out and ran for the zone line. The next<br/>
&gt;step is to kill 10 skeletons (can&#39;t remember exactly what type, but I know<br/>
&gt;they con dark blue -- not sure how well bow-kiting will work in such a busy<br/>
&gt;zone).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Frustrated with such difficult and dangerous tasks for my 49 ranger, I tried<br/>
&gt;a task with 10 cleric. I was sent into Innothule Swamp from a PoK task<br/>
&gt;master and told to kill 10 bull alligators (most con white, some a healthy<br/>
&gt;dark blue). I had to run for my life and died about 10 feet from the PoK<br/>
&gt;book. I didn&#39;t realize bull alligators helped each other out. I got trounced<br/>
&gt;by two of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m becoming increasingly convinced that tasks are not soloable. :(<br/>
