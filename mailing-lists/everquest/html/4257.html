<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093786974">Cool, thanks Wes, I was able to get it to work, something with the video<br/>
settings. Maybe this will alieviate my problem now of only being able to<br/>
play in 800x640. I love re-installs. LOL<br/>

Yes I had the exact same error. It was cause by my screen resolution <br/>
being 32 bits when my game resolution was set to 16 bits. <br/>
You can set the graphics resolution once your in the game, but to get <br/>
in the game try setting your display to 16 bits, 32 bits etc until <br/>
one works. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that solves your problem.<br/>
