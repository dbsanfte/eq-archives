<div id="ygrps-yiv-643743974">Welcome..<br/>
<br/>
I believe you install and run the program.  This includes all the patches.<br/>
Next you will come to a screen where you can create an account, Its one of<br/>
the buttons on the bottom right.  It will as you a few question.. Name..<br/>
Location.. etc.   There should be a number on your cd&#39;s jewel case.  It will<br/>
ask you for that number and for you to create a login name and password.<br/>
Finally after everything is completed you can click on the connect button.<br/>
Type in your username and password, this will connect you to the server<br/>
select screen.  Pick one of the green servers (for they are the least<br/>
crowded).  That&#39;s it...  Next screens that come up allow you to create a new<br/>
character.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this helps.. Imp sure I might have something out of order but the<br/>
basic information should be correct.  It&#39;s been almost two years since I had<br/>
to create an account. =)  <br/>
