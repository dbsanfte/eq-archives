<div id="ygrps-yiv-558557750">You know you can turn off all those channels in your options. Turn off /ooc,<br/>
/shout, /auction, /emotes and even /guild. It really cuts down on the spam.<br/>
I play with 2 computers and I always have these turned off on one of my<br/>
computers. My advice is you better get use to it. The higher level you get,<br/>
the more raids you are going to run into. Until Verant gives us the raid<br/>
chat channel they have promised us, this will always be there. <br/>

<br/>
	I was checking the list and thought i&#39;d add my two cents to this <br/>
	subject line :)<br/>
<br/>
	I play a shaman, i just hit level 18 two nights ago (^_^). Ive paid <br/>
	for a tp myself, sometimes more than usual to get out of a place i <br/>
	just cant stand (like yesterday.. i was hunting in Lake of Ill Omen <br/>
	and someone was doing a raid for their monk epic, and everyone was <br/>
	shouting and /oocing and even /auctioning and when i asked them to <br/>
	tone it down to one channel because not everyone in the zone was on <br/>
	the raid, i was rudely told to shut up and the less i whined the <br/>
	faster they would be done) or if im despreate and someone&#39;s switched<br/>
<br/>
	characters just to port me somewhere.  On the SoW part of the idea,<br/>
i <br/>
	think that taking a donation for a sow is all right, like when<br/>
you&#39;re <br/>
	in the middle of a fight and someone comes up asking for one,  or if<br/>
<br/>
	your in a group and really low on mana and someone comes up and<br/>
wants <br/>
	one, or when all you hear is &quot;can i have sow?&quot; &lt;cast spell&gt; &quot;ooh! <br/>
	shes casting sow!!&quot; &lt;the whole durn zone comes running over&gt; &quot;can i <br/>
	have sow?&quot;  I finally put my character on Roleplay mode (full anon<br/>
is <br/>
	not allowed by my guild) so people wouldnt ask me as often.  <br/>
	Occasionally i have the random &quot;you are being inspected&quot; and then i <br/>
	get asked for it (my weapon is shm only so its kind of a giveaway if<br/>
<br/>
	you know my wep), and ill always cast it for corpse runs for people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	A slightly different subject now... Can anyone suggest a good<br/>
surname <br/>
	for my shammie?  Her name&#39;s Lorecie, at the rate im going i&#39;ll be 20<br/>
<br/>
	by the end of the month and i want a surname hehehe.  Also am<br/>
looking <br/>
	for suggestions for my fiancee (both in game and real life) for his <br/>
	characer... so i&#39;ll be taking his surname on soon.  <br/>
<br/>
	Thanks for any suggestions and my random ranting about the jerks in <br/>
	LoIO.<br/>

	&gt; &gt;to me. Sure, I sometimes get stiffed and sometimes<br/>
	&gt; &gt;get something I can&#39;t use as a tip, but for the most<br/>
	&gt; &gt;part I think I have been well rewarded. For me <br/>
	&gt; &gt;it is in character and adds to the game.<br/>
	&gt; <br/>
	&gt; I think i&#39;m coming to the conclusion that a Druid<br/>
	&gt; should less demand payment for a TP, than players<br/>
	&gt; should feel that the right thing to do is to donate<br/>
	&gt; what they can for one. :) As someone who&#39;s taken quite<br/>
	&gt; a few, I always make sure I have the standard 10pp<br/>
	&gt; available to offer, it&#39;s just the right thing to do<br/>
	&gt; for the investment of time being given for the other<br/>
	&gt; player. I don&#39;t think i&#39;d stand there once my druid<br/>
	&gt; can group TP and demand payment, but watching that<br/>
	&gt; twinked level 12 with better equipment than I have go<br/>
	&gt; on about how broke he is might be a little hard to<br/>
	&gt; swallow.<br/>
