<div id="ygrps-yiv-955309676">The old system of alchemy is in the process of being overhauled. A<br/>
year ago, I did the kitty shaman alchemy quests just short of the<br/>
epic. I lost interest and decided that it was more fun to just lvl by<br/>
hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have a lvl 43 shaman with 21 points in alchemy. The trainers<br/>
won&#39;t increase my points above that until I actually atart using the<br/>
skill. G.<br/>
<br/>
The old formulas have changed. Has anyone worked out the best way to<br/>
bring the alchemy points up yet with the new formulas? I&#39;m doing<br/>
homework on this too. It&#39;s still in progress. I&#39;ll share what I find.<br/>
Has someone else already invented the wheel? G.<br/>
