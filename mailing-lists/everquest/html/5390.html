<div id="ygrps-yiv-820175027">Regarding pulling I usually have the tanks pull. This way the aggro stays on<br/>
them. The strategy I usually use when forming a group is tanks at point, one<br/>
puller (Either tank or archer otherwise it gets to confusing), nukers to the<br/>
left, healers to the right. Seems to work pretty good, occasionally we will<br/>
get some nasties going after the healers and nukers but then we just have to<br/>
pull the aggros off them is all. And of course this is providing I can get<br/>
an even group! LOL<br/>

&gt; In PoP a bard is the puller of choice. Who cares if lull <br/>
&gt; fails, if we can fade. Faster then trying to split the pull. <br/>
&gt; If you are pulling aggro off of a tank, well, you are doing <br/>
&gt; it wrong. It is not thier job to keep aggro off you, but your <br/>
&gt; job to not pull it off the tank. Try FD every 30 seconds. <br/>
&gt; Then you can do max damage.<br/>
