    I heard it was 48 in real time hours, (your average daily time).<br/>

Getting suff back can depend a little on where you died and if you can find<br/>
youself.<br/>
I died once in some place, (Don&#39;t remember know, just finally gave up),<br/>
Couldn&#39;t find it and basically had to start over.<br/>
One thing I do is if you can get a couple of good weapons for your character<br/>
is to place one in the bank, that way if you die<br/>
you can go to the bank and get it out so you can go get your corpse. At<br/>
least you&#39;ll have some weaponry to defend yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Also if you died at Orc hill or somewhere like that try to group and see if<br/>
they would cover you until you can get all your stuff back.<br/>
