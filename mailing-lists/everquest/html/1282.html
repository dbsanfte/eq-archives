<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538221691"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I love when I am grouped with a good effective group and they loot fairly. &nbsp;
<br>But that like you said isn&#39;t always the case. &nbsp;Ok first a totally off the 
<br>subject complaint with grouping...as an enchanter who can mez...don&#39;t hit the 
<br>mezzed mob! &nbsp;Ok, had to get that off my chest. &nbsp;I hate when they do that. &nbsp;
<br>And I tell them not to and they still do it. &nbsp;Ok, with the looting. &nbsp;
<br>Yesterday it was FFA and I was trying to keep haste on tanks and everyone&#39;s 
<br>breeze going and tashan and languid pace on mob and so there was a lot of 
<br>medding going on and I wasn&#39;t getting loot. &nbsp;When I did loot I never got but 
<br>a few silver or gold. &nbsp;The others were looting gems (which I could use ) and 
<br>tasarin pages (which I really need) and was offering to buy. &nbsp;Well I meant to 
<br>do a guild tell saying The bad thing about having to med in a group is I miss 
<br>out on all the loot. &nbsp;Well guess what...I did a group tell. &nbsp;Well then the 
<br>main tank started telling me to loot. &nbsp;She said looting isn&#39;t going to take 
<br>away that much med time. &nbsp;And I also started saying hey can I have that 
<br>Tasarins because no one else could use them in the group but me. &nbsp;I like the 
<br>alpha loot 2 times no split. &nbsp;I think it works good if people follow it. &nbsp;I 
<br>hate FFA!

<br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote TYPE="CITE" style="BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;">Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems with
<br>loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main
<br>healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get
<br>totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha
<br>loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they care
<br>about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in
<br>&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a
<br>chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will
<br>still loot out of turn.
<br>And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.
<br>When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a
<br>ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he
<br>picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an expensive
<br>item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a
<br>bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only
<br>for bronze armor&quot;...
<br>Has anyone else had this problem?
<br>What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?
<br>Just wondering.
<br>luv,
<br>-Su
<br>ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when
<br>people cooperate.</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial">
