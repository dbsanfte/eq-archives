 </span></blockquote>If you look on the small print on the box you will see it clearly says a<br/>
Credit Card (or a pre-pay EQ Game Card) is required to play.<br/>
<br/>
The numbers that come with the CD&#39;s are those used to register your<br/>
account, or to register an expansion pack on your account. To actually<br/>
*activate* the account you need to sign up with either a credit card or<br/>
a pre-pay game card. Billing will not occur until 30 days have passed.<br/>
As far as I can tell they are pretty good at not billing until after<br/>
your 30 day trial runs out.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you can (as far as I can tell) sign up with your crdit card then<br/>
immediately cancel your acount. If you cancel immediately you should<br/>
then still have 30 days to try the game out, and if you like it you can<br/>
just reactivate the account and it will seamlessly continue after the 30<br/>
days are up, and billing still won&#39;t start untill the 30 days expire.<br/>
<br/>
And they don&#39;t delete cancelled accounts. You can cancel, come back a<br/>
year later and reactivate your account and your characters will all be<br/>
there exactly as you left them.<br/>
