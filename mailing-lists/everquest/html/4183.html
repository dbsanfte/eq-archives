<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537583091">I very much enjoy PC gaming. I also like to play on consoles. I find <br/>
the style of game play is quite different in each medium.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately the consoles prove the easiest and least expensive to buy <br/>
and upgrade. Generally a console and two games, maybe a few more <br/>
items, can be had for $300.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to put a decent pc together for gaming for under $1000. <br/>
About double that will net a decent machine with upgrade potential, <br/>
but without the need to upgrade for some time.<br/>
<br/>
The upper end of pc gaming runs around $8000. <br/>
<br/>
Obviously, more people can buy in for $300 than for the $1000 plus.<br/>
<br/>
Part of me wants to be a pc hotrodder, and build an ubermachine. Big, <br/>
bad, and hot. With adequate cooling, as well. That part of me does <br/>
not have access to the purse. Sadly, real life expenses have first <br/>
claim on my wallet.<br/>
<br/>
So, I am watching the trends, and encouraging myself to adopt the <br/>
philosophy that I am a gamer, and the platform is less important than <br/>
the experience. It is within the scope of possibility, and probably <br/>
in the path of great profitability for the makers, that console <br/>
online multiplayer games will be of such game quality in the future <br/>
that holding onto the pc platform will be only an option, and not a <br/>
necessity.<br/>
<br/>
Alternately, I can see online game manufacturers selling systems to <br/>
insure their audience is there. Wouldn&#39;t that be grand? Order the <br/>
game and the system all for one monthly payment. Upgrade components <br/>
will be shipped when software demands require it. Your system will <br/>
always be current.<br/>
<br/>
What will the future hold? I don&#39;t know, but I am sure I cannot be <br/>
shelling out several thousand dollars every other year. The cost has <br/>
to be brought in line with the spending capacity of a large audience, <br/>
or else the hobby will suffer decline.<br/>
