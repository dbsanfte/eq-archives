<div>Hi Peg and welcome to the wonderful world of EQ, lets see if we can answer a few of your questions and end some of your confusion. And may I say how refreshing your view of this world is, brought back a lot of memories for me and trust me I still get lost and follow people around.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Power Leveling is not that bad if it&#39;s done right, I know of one guild who require their members to PL the lower members which to me is wrong. There&#39;s two ways to do it, one is to have the high level throw all their buffs on you to increase your hit points and everything else, put damage shields or absorbers around you,&nbsp;then you go kill everything in sight and they heal you when you need it. This way you get all the experience, you&#39;re taking the hits so you build up the defense you need, your hit ability increases and as a paladin you can Taunt so make a hot button and use it. When you do taunt you&#39;re basically telling the mob or monster to ignore everyone else and attack you, something you&#39;re going to do later in groups to get the mobs off your healer or castor type classes. In higher groups if your healer dies then chances are good that you will too, although you do have the ability to bandage and something called Laying on Hands. You can lay your hands on someone by using the skills hot button and heal them but it takes a long while for this to be used again so use caution when you decide to do this.</div>
<div>The other way is they do all the buffs, the high level&nbsp;walks up to the mob hits it to get it down to about 49% health then you fight it to get the experience. You don&#39;t learn how to take the hits so your defense doesn&#39;t go up as fast and you don&#39;t get as much practice with your weapons so those skills don&#39;t go up as fast either.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One way for you to get some experience without a lot of risk is when you are in your home city talk to the Exterminator, he&#39;s going to tell you about a rodent problem they have and if you kill them and bring him 4 rat whiskers he&#39;ll reward you. Kill all the rodents you can find, at your level they are going to be white or dark blue to you so you&#39;re going to get some experience from them and a few coins from turning in the whiskers. Once you get another level then you will have a easier fight with the skeletons to get their bones.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you loot something the window that comes up is their inventory, it shows what they have on them that you can get. When you right click on it then it will go into your inventory to see it in your backpack right click on it and it will open it up so you can see what you have. Sell what you don&#39;t need to the vendors, save any food or water you get from them and any armor you can use, buy another backpack as you can afford it so you can carry more stuff to sell.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/">http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/</a>&nbsp;you can download the maps for all the zones, they&#39;re more detailed then the one&#39;s you already have just unzip them and put them in your maps folder on your computer. To use them hit the backspace button and it will show you the map of the zone you&#39;re in and what is around you as far as supplies, vendors and camps where the mobs are.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The place you went to is called PoK or Plain of Knowledge and you will get very used to running through there, think of it as Grand Central Station where you can get to any zone you want without having a long run. You&#39;ll also find guild masters to train with there so you don&#39;t have to keep going back to your own town, vendors of all kinds and the library where you can buy your spells. At level 9, which I know seems a long way away at the moment, you will start to get your own spells to use and if you can&#39;t find them in your guild hall chances are good you will find them here or someone who knows where you can get them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you use the spells you will use your mana to cast them, when you are out of mana then you won&#39;t be able to cast them any more. This is where medding comes in, you sit and meditate to get your mana back so you can cast more spells. Just one hint here don&#39;t sit down in the middle of a camp to med, when you do the mobs will attack you so go somewhere off to the side or with your group so they can protect you while you do this.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Above all else have fun, the class you&#39;ve chosen is a wonderful one able to heal, buff and fight you are going to love it.</div>
