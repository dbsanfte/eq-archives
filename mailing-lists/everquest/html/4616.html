<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-845050097">Tanking PoP, either SK or Paladin will do fine. SKs gain/maintain <br/>
agro through offensive spells. Paladins gain/maintain aggro through <br/>
mostly defensive and healing spells. Paladins have the luxury of <br/>
excellent buffs and group heals which are also excellent agro-<br/>
generating spells. SKs have the luxury of strong damage spells. <br/>
<br/>
Both classes pretty much own the same equipment so STAT differences <br/>
are completely trivial.<br/>
<br/>
Your pick... offense or defense.</div>
