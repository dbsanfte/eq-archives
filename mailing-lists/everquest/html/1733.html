<div id="ygrps-yiv-412323197">Maybe they think they are helping you by taking off some of the mobs so you<br/>
don&#39;t get killed?<br/>
Man, I remember when I once had some lower lvl follow me around and try to<br/>
loot everything I killed. He even sat on one of the corpses so I couldn&#39;t<br/>
loot it. I had to threaten to petition his ass for him to go away.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hi everyone!<br/>
&gt;   What is up with the kill stealing? I&#39;ve had it<br/>
&gt; happen to me several times where I was soloing and<br/>
&gt; after killing several creatures, (Getting attacked one<br/>
&gt; right after another), I&#39;ll find that while I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; fighting off an attacker my other kills have been<br/>
&gt; stolen. Sometimes I&#39;ll even see them do it. Granted<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve gone up to some other players kills after a time<br/>
&gt; mistaking it for one of mine but I mean blatently<br/>
&gt; going up and stealing a kill right in front of the<br/>
&gt; original player?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That really sucks!<br/>
&gt; C-ya!<br/>
