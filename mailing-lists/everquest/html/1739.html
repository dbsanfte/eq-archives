<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742929276">Maybe, Usually if I&#39;m getting slammed I&#39;ll leave the kills and save my<br/>
ass! I don&#39;t mind too much then but when I just walk up to a couple of<br/>
wasps and kill them and one dissapears while I&#39;m looting the other,<br/>
thatÂ’s what really gets me. <br/>
Sitting on a corpse! Man it&#39;s players like that who make me want to<br/>
create a bad-ass PK and just hunt them down at times!<br/>

Maybe they think they are helping you by taking off some of the mobs so<br/>
you<br/>
don&#39;t get killed?<br/>
Man, I remember when I once had some lower lvl follow me around and try<br/>
to<br/>
loot everything I killed. He even sat on one of the corpses so I<br/>
couldn&#39;t<br/>
loot it. I had to threaten to petition his ass for him to go away.<br/>
