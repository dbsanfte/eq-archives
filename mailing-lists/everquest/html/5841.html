&gt; Does anyone else find it annoying when you&#39;ve been in a guild for 4 <br/>
&gt; years as an officer and some new people come along and when you&#39;re not <br/>
&gt; looking one of the new people becomes leader without your approval and <br/>
&gt; then starts telling you that you have to change the way you talk in <br/>
&gt; guild and who you hang out with and stuff like that?<br/>
&gt; Or is it just me?<br/>
<br/>
