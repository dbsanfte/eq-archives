<div><strong><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Sorry I have to disagree with 
you. The CS online was always good. If you needed a GM you might have to wait 
MAYBE up to an hour on a busy day but would get a GM. Now with the GM pool you 
can wait days on end and still never get help from one. I have no problem with 
the cost going up to $12.95 a month but the CS should go up with it or at least 
stay the same but it has gone down hill. They have become uncaring about the 
customers. Now they have a pocket pc version,EQ 2,SWG and gods knows what else. 
They just don&#39;t care about the customers anymore and that is just a shame. When 
they cared more about the customers&nbsp; you got things like Newbie armor(how 
long has it been since you have seen any added like they promised?),spells that 
could be used even if you did not buy the expansion,etc...

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay I have to step in 
  here.&nbsp; first of all customer service has always sucked.&nbsp; I used to 
  call before the stormhammer server went live using the 800 number and it was 
  always busy.&nbsp; Occasionally i would get through but that was few and far 
  between.&nbsp; Second of all those who play Stormhammer should get a little 
  more support due to the fact the server cost about $40/month instead of the 
  $12.95/month that you pay or I pay for that matter.&nbsp; Third have you tried 
  using the live tech support on the web site itself es you may wait a while 
  before someone comes on but when they do they take all the time you need to 
  get your problem solved.&nbsp; Also if you read the note that was posted on 
  the site you would have seen the reason they rasied the price of the 
  game.&nbsp; finally I like the game and disagree that the game is going 
  downhill, it is perfectly fine the way it is .&nbsp; I hate to say this if you 
  don&#39;;t likeit so much than why play.</font></div><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest
