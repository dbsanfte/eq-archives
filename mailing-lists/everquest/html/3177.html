<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-28813603">Ok, I have a level 11 warrior and would like your<br/>
opinion on the following:<br/>
<br/>
I started wondering why I was not hitting that much<br/>
with him even though he has a good weapon. After some<br/>
research, I found that the reason I am not hitting as<br/>
much as others is because I have been switching<br/>
between 2HS and 1HS weapons to increase the skills of<br/>
each attribute.  <br/>
<br/>
Example: My skill in both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br/>
attack is at like 152.  If I were to just use 1HS<br/>
let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br/>
<br/>
I have proved this because now that I am using the 1HS<br/>
more, the skill is close to 30 and my ATK rating is<br/>
close to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is still at<br/>
152.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would you continue to alternate both weapon types or<br/>
would you just pick one and go with it?<br/>
<br/>
THanks<br/>
