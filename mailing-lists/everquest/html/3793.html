<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262412889">I don&#39;t know what level you are, but I&#39;ve made up to 100pp an hour in Rathe<br/>
grouped and doing alpha loot... The most I&#39;ve looted off a HG at one time is<br/>
41pp, the least is a few gold. Usually it&#39;s pp somewhere in between.<br/>
Everyone I know at all levels above 30 go to Rathe specifically for cash...<br/>
Xp is good if you are a lower level (I have a 29 Troll SK)but cash is the<br/>
best I&#39;ve seen so far. Speaking of Unrest, my guild (Fire and Brimstone,<br/>
Ayonae Ro) is doing a raid on Unrest this Saturday, should be fun I need to<br/>
replace the Bloodstained Mantle I lost in a bad trade awhile back... They<br/>
are doing a raid on Mistmoore tonight, but I can&#39;t loose faction with the<br/>
Indigo Brotherhood since I do all my business in Neriak....<br/>
  Anyway, my 2cp on makin money... I checked out the guides too, I&#39;ll keep<br/>
doin what I&#39;ve been doin....<br/>

Thank you for posting this. I went to check them out and you know I have to<br/>
say I was a little dissapointed in the guides. A lot of the information that<br/>
they contain can be found at almost any EQ related website! It&#39;s basically<br/>
that I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay for any of these guides, it&#39;s really not worth<br/>
the money. The only thing I&#39;m truly interested in is making money. Man it<br/>
sucks trying to get some decent armor when you have no money. I&#39;ve wondered<br/>
about the &quot;make Plat at any level&quot; guides and I figured that you would still<br/>
need to group or partner at some point. <br/>
<br/>
Either way I&#39;m having fun just going along and doing things the old<br/>
fashioned way. I do suggest going and getting these guides because there<br/>
were a few things in there that was nice to know about but for any player,<br/>
especially noobs, I suggest doing it the old fashioned way and go out there<br/>
and take the lumps and partner with some others. It&#39;s funner and you&#39;ll feel<br/>
better knowing that you did it on your own. <br/>
<br/>
I got some good info about Unrest so I think I may go and try it out this<br/>
week. <br/>
