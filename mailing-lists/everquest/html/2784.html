<div id="ygrps-yiv-675557360">Which version of EQ did you install? The requrements go up with the <br/>
expansions. Luclin is the big kicker, raising the level beyond any <br/>
other game I know about.<br/>
<br/>
If you play only the original version while preparing to make <br/>
upgrades you can have considerable fun even on an old or weak system.<br/>
<br/>
You will probably experience fewer frustrations that way than by <br/>
trying to play the full game on an inadequate system.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;    How is everyone doing tonight? I am having troble with playing <br/>
&gt; EverQuest. I was a stupid A*&, I bought the game and I did not look <br/>
&gt; at the requirements. And, my computer is not up to the task. I am <br/>
&gt; going to have to up grade it to play it hardcore. I am loooking <br/>
&gt; forward to playing on a normal bases. I am hoping reading all of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; posting that all of you make with pay off. I am a human paladin. <br/>
Any <br/>
&gt; help or hints will be greatly appreciated! I am looking forward to <br/>
&gt; meet people on there and make friends and alliances.<br/>
