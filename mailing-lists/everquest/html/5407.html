<div id="ygrps-yiv-95173069">Yeah. I think the whole Death Squad triggering thing is kindof stupid. It<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be that difficult to find Tanik. I had help from a high level<br/>
necro. He used his pet to find the location of the guy and upon making sure<br/>
it wasn&#39;t the Death Squad, he brought me over to do the hand in.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yeah, the 4th shawl is the death squad. I get so tired<br/>
&gt; of wandering around, hoping to trip over that dwarf,<br/>
&gt; lol.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Snow griffin eggs are the last part of the 3rd shawl.<br/>
&gt; Also boring, but at least you&#39;re killing stuff. :)<br/>
