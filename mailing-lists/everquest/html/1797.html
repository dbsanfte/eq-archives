<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128747958">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m about 2 years late but better late than never.  I am on <br/>
Ayonae Ro and just made a dwarf cleric.  Any little tips and advice <br/>
thrown my way will be very appreciated.  Beside saving up fo rmy <br/>
spell, I bought the book, should I invest next for my armor? weapon? <br/>
or misc items such as rings?  Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
