  <div>Hi Peg,</div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div>You have started a thread here that is very intresting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like 
  others I enjoyed reading about your early exploits, and now reading about what 
  others went thru is so cool.&nbsp; I started with a wizzard.....which wasn&#39;t 
  the best choice for a first time player.&nbsp; But I read the Lord of the 
  Rings, and Gandolph is powerfull, sooo I chose a wizzard.&nbsp; I came up in 
  freeport and immeaditly got lost.&nbsp; Then I ran out of food and drink, they 
  didn&#39;t start you with much back then.&nbsp; I never saw a McDonnald&#39;s or a 
  Safeway, and I&#39;m dying from starvation.&nbsp; I asked another player where to 
  find food, and he said just let your character die and you&#39;ll get more, I was 
  horrified.&nbsp; I too had to ask how to open doors....tried saying open 
  sesimee, didn&#39;t work.&nbsp; But when I tried to hail an orc, he killed me, and 
  food problem was solved, temporarly.&nbsp; Then I ran the wrong way and 
  the&nbsp;game froze for a few seconds, then it said I was in East 
  Commonlands.&nbsp; By that point, I was so frustrated that I allmost 
  quit.&nbsp; But then I attacked a skelli and won, I was sooo proud of that 
  kill.&nbsp; </div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div>The point of all this is we all went thru what you are now.&nbsp; And 
  there is no totally right or wrong way to play, because you can&#39;t possibly 
  accomplish all there is in the game.&nbsp; We have all made mistakes, and 
  there are ways to correct them later.&nbsp; The main thing is to have 
  fun.&nbsp; So somebody power levels you a bit.....enjoy it, it&#39;s another 
  experience in the game.&nbsp; And if you attack a willowisp without a magical 
  weapon.....well, join the club.&nbsp; I think we all made that mistake at 
  least once.&nbsp; You will have times that everything goes wrong, and other 
  times it all goes right.....just like real life.&nbsp; That&#39;s what makes this 
  game so much fun, &nbsp;&nbsp;and before you know it, you&#39;ll be telling a 
  newbie about the letter you lost, and laughing about how much you didn&#39;t know 
  &quot;way back then&quot;.&nbsp; Some players are mean and cruel, so be carefull, but 
  most are friendly and willing to help you when things get &quot;impossible&quot;.&nbsp; 
  When you are lost, most will help you find your way.&nbsp; Just like this 
  &quot;e-loop&quot; many are trying to help you now.</div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div>So, relax, and enjoy, and tell us more.....you write very well and it&#39;s a 
  pleasure to read what you have to say.&nbsp; </div>

    (Long...help?!)</div>
    <div><br></div><tt><br>Hello all,<br><br>My name is Peg, and I am glad to 
    have found your e-loop.&nbsp; I&#39;m one<br>of <br>those newbies.&nbsp; Started 
    about three weeks ago, role playing as <br>Qaidyanye, (still a 1st level 
    High Elf-Paly) on the Brell Serilis <br>server.<br><br>I have been trying to 
    learn as much as possible from my basic EQ <br>Gold manual, a set of the 
    Prima Players Guides a couple of sites <br>online and this loop.&nbsp; I 
    absolutely love to read about EQ play.&nbsp; I <br>can only get on for one 
    extended play and a couple of shorter <br>sessions a week though, so don&#39;t 
    have a lot of intense time online.<br><br>(1) I wanted to roleplay and not 
    use any of what is called the <br>power leveling ...but I&#39;m so 
    unknowledgeable, I think I have <br>accidentally...?&nbsp; I found a small 
    mail quest and was talking to a <br>really high level (59 or so) SK, who for 
    whatever reason deemed to <br>group me and told me to get on 
    auto-follow.&nbsp; She got me from <br>Felwithe to the orc lift at 
    Kelethin.&nbsp; So cool when you&#39;re new.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Anyhow, up the lift 
    I went.&nbsp; I found the Bard&#39;s Guild Hall, however, <br>when I went to 
    deliver the &#39;letter&#39; --- it was no longer in my <br>inventory...I am certain 
    it was given to me from an NPC character <br>(Tissleplay.&nbsp; Its not like 
    I have a lot in inventory yet as you know <br>with newbies, but the `letter&#39; 
    was gone when I went to &#39;give&#39;<br>it to <br>the Bard.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I 
    wandered around the treetops for awhile.&nbsp; I spoke <br>to a few players, 
    but found nothing to do and was trying to figure <br>out how I could get 
    back through the forest to Felwithe to do my <br>basic training 
    points.&nbsp; As I was walking around through the tree <br>platforms, from 
    my back came an attack by an orc something or <br>other...after he struck me 
    the first time I ran to a guard nearby, <br>but the orc thingy killed me and 
    the guard.&nbsp; So I &#39;came back&#39; at the <br>entrance to Greater Faydark I 
    think.<br><br>Very soon after I started walking, a character began talking 
    with <br>me, and I talked with him for awhile.&nbsp; He said he was a level 
    six, <br>he was bald looking and had a green robe of some type on.&nbsp; He 
    wanted <br>to &#39;group&#39;, and we went along towards the town center.&nbsp; He 
    told me <br>about swimming and I tried that.<br>Then he told me let&#39;s 
    meditate, after sitting for awhile, I went <br>over to try and talk with an 
    NPC for fishing supplies, when I came <br>back this group leader guy 
    Summader) was dead.&nbsp; He didn&#39;t come back <br>very quickly, so I went 
    along.&nbsp; I found some quest that said if I <br>collected the bone chips 
    of four skeletons I would be &#39;richly <br>rewarded.&#39;&nbsp; So I went to the 
    outside of Faydark, and Summader was <br>there again.&nbsp; I told him of my 
    quest and he said let&#39;s go...he had <br>some sorts of magic spells and used 
    them on a couple of skeletons, <br>and motioned for me to pick up the 
    loot.&nbsp; Which I think I did.&nbsp; Then <br>this Summader 
    disappeared.&nbsp; Here I am, level one, innocent little <br>Paly, 
    drakelings, flying bats, skeletons...twinkling twinks or <br>something like 
    that all around me...no path in sight.&nbsp; I start <br>running; suddenly I 
    see a path, and on the other side what looks <br>like a stanchion with a 
    book on top of it.&nbsp; I went over and clicked, <br>thinking it was some 
    sort of clue etc....and it says &#39;loading&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>(2)&nbsp; Then 
    suddenly I am somewhere else...(I have EQ Gold edition <br>which includes 
    Everquest Classic, Ruins of Kunark, Shadows of <br>Luclin, Scars of Velious 
    and Planes of Power.)---so did I &#39;power up <br>somewhere?&quot;&nbsp; Or was this 
    just some sort of portal?&nbsp; Open ground area <br>with mostly one story 
    Grecian architecture type buildings...quite a <br>lot of different races 
    running about. Text is scrolling by fast on <br>my main window, most of 
    which is peppered with abbreviations I <br>cannot figure out of course 
    :o)....I turned one corner, and then it <br>looks like a big party...at 
    least 15 or 20 characters, different <br>races/species, all slinging magic 
    of some sort or practicing or ?&nbsp; <br>I, irl, was at that a little fried 
    from this log-on and all the <br>activity and not having any inkling where I 
    am, or what is going <br>on.&nbsp; I could find hardly anyone who would 
    speak with mea very<br>busy <br>place! Finally, a gallant, (sweet) 
    manly-man :0), took a minute to <br>walk me over to some sort of vertically 
    designed stone and I got <br>back to Greater Faydark and then camped.&nbsp; 
    And so that is my <br>(probably quite boring) saga.&nbsp; <br><br>When I 
    went online the next time, a most helpful Cleric struck up a 
    <br>conversation with me.&nbsp; She was very generous with gifts and her 
    <br>time.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, I kept getting disconnected 1001 errors.) 
    She <br>said she gave to me three items  I think leather legging, a 
    vest<br>or <br>jacket of some sort, and something else.&nbsp; She also gave 
    me 107 <br>plat.&nbsp; The plat showed up on my inventory screen; but I 
    can&#39;t<br>find <br>the gifts.&nbsp; She kept trying to tell me to look in my 
    backpack as I <br>don&#39;t have any bags yet.&nbsp; I have scoured my manual 
    and<br>guidesI <br>click on my backpack and see the image of the 
    backpackbut I<br>don&#39;t <br>know how to `open&#39; it or access the 
    contents.&nbsp; So I found a<br>bank and <br>put my money in, and went out 
    happily hunting truth and injustice as <br>only a powerful 1st level Paly 
    can doand I actually killed<br>several <br>rodents AND a spiderlingAND 
    attacked a skeleton-looking<br>thing,<br>ding,I got promoted, now evil 
    Norrath residents are cowering as I <br>practice my hunting prowess as a 
    Level 2 High Elf Paly<br><br>Now what?!&nbsp; I thought I would try to get 
    some info before going back <br>on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love this, but have 
    absolutely no one irl who is the least <br>bit interested in any sort of 
    roleplaying type game...or knows <br>anything about EQ.<br><br>In one of the 
    last EQ digests I read, Flaumigevylke said:<br>&quot;... But I have to say as 
    well that there&#39;s characters from every <br>class I&#39;ve played with have done 
    the same thing, they don&#39;t know how <br>to play and end up getting the whole 
    group wiped out. Personally I <br>blame it on them being power leveled and 
    not taking the time to <br>learn how to really play them or know what their 
    full capabilities <br>are.&quot;<br><br><br>It would be so helpful to all of the 
    newbies reading this, if you <br>vet&#39;s would give us a general overview of 
    the most beneficial trek <br>toward being a good supportive player by the 
    time we are at higher <br>levels.&nbsp; I know skills and training is 
    somewhat different dependent <br>upon the race and class.&nbsp; I would love 
    some personal guidance on how <br>to become a rock solid Paly!&nbsp; But, 
    general pointers are also helpful <br>to beginners.&nbsp; There is a HUGE 
    amount of information. Like, I&#39;ve <br>read in all my guides, if you are a 
    level below 10 or so, you should <br>practice or train your skills any 
    chance you get; and also not to <br>venture much past where a guard is, that 
    you shouldn&#39;t try to kill <br>even the smaller mobs if there are multiples, 
    etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; --- so how do I <br>move up in levels?&nbsp; I have no 
    inkling yet, how to strategize.&nbsp; I <br>know what my main inventory 
    window is, but when I have killed <br>something and loot it, a different 
    window pops up...does everything <br>I loot go automatically to my main 
    inventory window, or am I suppose <br>to access some other sort of window to 
    see the items I am obtaining <br>towards a quest I am on? Some character 
    said he gave me a &#39;buff&#39; and <br>for me to go fight something---that the 
    buff would be good for two <br>hours.&nbsp; But how do I confirm something 
    like this; what window do I <br>go to in order to see what sort of magical 
    help he gave me?&nbsp; <br><br>I swear never to write more than a two 
    paragraph post again, pls <br>don&#39;t kick me off the list for taking up too 
    much space and time!&nbsp; <br>Thanks a lot, <br><br>Sign me:<br>Hoping for 
    a lot of help now, so that a few seasons from now I won&#39;t <br>sound so 
    pathetic and I can later help someone else...<br>Q on Brell
