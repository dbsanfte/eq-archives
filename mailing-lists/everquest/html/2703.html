&gt; <br/>
&gt; G&#39;Fay is famous for the /ooc beggar.  I, like you,<br/>
&gt; usually end up &quot;chiding&quot;<br/>
&gt; any beggar that pollutes the chat with a constant<br/>
&gt; cry for platinum or even<br/>
&gt; Power Leveling and gear. But, I have never been<br/>
&gt; accused of being too harsh<br/>
&gt; with someone.  Most people start sending me tells<br/>
&gt; agreeing with me about<br/>
&gt; stupid beggars, and then they /ooc support to my<br/>
&gt; discouragement of begging.<br/>
&gt; And NOTHING pisses me off more than the ungrateful<br/>
&gt; player. I have on<br/>
&gt; occasion given some plat or newbie gear to people<br/>
&gt; that wouldn&#39;t stop begging<br/>
&gt; just to shut them up. And yes, I would say that most<br/>
&gt; of the begging souls<br/>
&gt; that I have donated anything to were just as<br/>
&gt; ungrateful as the chap that you<br/>
&gt; described.  They can&#39;t even bother to type 2 letters<br/>
&gt; -TY- or God forbid that<br/>
&gt; they might actually /bow or /kneel or /thank... <br/>
&gt; &lt;:-P&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I too often seek out young players above 3rd or 4th<br/>
&gt; season that appear to be<br/>
&gt; working hard to advance themselves the way that most<br/>
&gt; of us did as<br/>
&gt; NewB&#39;s....and while I expect nothing in return for<br/>
&gt; the small gifts that I<br/>
&gt; give. I find that more often than not these players<br/>
&gt; are very thankful and<br/>
&gt; benevolent.  It just makes me feel all warm and<br/>
&gt; fuzzy to make some new<br/>
&gt; player&#39;s day.<br/>
&gt; I have found that it &quot;pays&quot; to work hard for the<br/>
&gt; things that you want--in RL<br/>
&gt; and in EQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was going to say something about how all beggars<br/>
&gt; should publicly die slow<br/>
&gt; cruel deaths in explicit detail, but I&#39;ll leave it<br/>
&gt; to your imagination----<br/>

&gt; times of the day and night,<br/>
&gt; feel free to say hello or even BEG from me, well<br/>
&gt; that is to say that if you<br/>
&gt; would like to make the list of people that will<br/>
&gt; never ever ever get a free<br/>
&gt; or cheap REZ from me you should definitely beg.)<br/>
