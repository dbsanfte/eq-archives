<div id="ygrps-yiv-720636248">LOL not on Rodcet, except a few of us old school folks on crap puters. I go<br/>
to places like Sol A bc there&#39;s fewer assholes, hubby and I can hold any<br/>
camp in zone except the king, the exp is still workable and the cash is<br/>
nice. We&#39;re also usually the only ones around except maybe a cleric going<br/>
for Lord Gimp.<br/>

&gt; Thanks to those who responded to my question about XP bonuses.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just out of curiosity, does the XP bonus actually entice more people to go<br/>
&gt; to the zones that have the bonus? I&#39;ve started hunting the far upper<br/>
levels<br/>
&gt; in The Befallen (on Tarew Marr server) and I&#39;ve typically been the only<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; in the entire zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
