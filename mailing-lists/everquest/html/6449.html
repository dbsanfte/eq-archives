<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790435229">That would be the exception to the rule, if they all ready knew how to<br/>
play the game with relative certainty.  I used to be a guild leader,<br/>
and I can&#39;t count the number of times that newb&#39;s joined the guild and<br/>
asked to be powerleveled, even though they had only been playing EQ<br/>
for a couple of weeks.  I always refused and tried to explain how that<br/>
would hurt them in the long run.  More times than not, they would<br/>
leave the guild and join another guild that was more liberal about<br/>
doing such things.<br/>
<br/>
Having played for 5 years, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen the enchanter who<br/>
joins a pick up group, and when you get adds, they start off tanking<br/>
instead of mezzing the adds.  That is just scary to me, LOL.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t PL other people.  I only PL my own toons.  The difference is<br/>
that I have 2 accounts, 2 computers, and have been playign the game<br/>
for over 5 years.  I&#39;ve had people offer to pay me to PL them, but<br/>
when that happens I usually see if they have any other alts that are<br/>
high level.  If they do, then sometimes I PL them cause I figure they<br/>
probably know what they&#39;re doing to some extent.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Does anyone else see PLing beyond level 20 as wrong?  I mean, if<br/>
&gt;   you&#39;re trying to catch up to someone else to be able to group with<br/>
&gt;   them (and you&#39;ve actually gotten a toon above 20 before), then I could<br/>
&gt;   see it.  But powerleveling people up to 20+, just because they want to<br/>
&gt;   be uber and go to better zones for better drops isn&#39;t teaching them<br/>
&gt;   how to play their character very well, IMO.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I have more fun fighting and scratching my way toward 70, than just<br/>
&gt;   killing the same mobs over and over until they turn blue, them moving<br/>
&gt;   to another zone to kill tougher stuff.  To me, it&#39;s the journey and<br/>
&gt;   learning to play your character properly.  Nothing irks me more than<br/>
&gt;   to group with someone who is level 60, but has no real clue as to how<br/>
&gt;   to play their toon.  It steals from everyone in the groups good<br/>
&gt;   experience to have to &quot;take care of&quot; the newb who was PL&#39;d to 60.<br/>
