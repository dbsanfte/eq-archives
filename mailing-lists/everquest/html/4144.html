<div id="ygrps-yiv-38971782">Not stupid at all. I couldn&#39;t get the translocators to work until <br/>
someone sitting nearby pointed out my chronic misspelling of a <br/>
critical word.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in this case i did it correctly. tried several times. will <br/>
probably try again later, if the info from the previous posts does <br/>
not provide a solution. from checking the list of quests, it may well <br/>
be that some were not suitable for my level. I will explore these <br/>
later.<br/>

&gt; Just asking the stupid question here, but you did type &quot;continue&quot; <br/>
right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is standard procedure to get more dialogue if the npc needs to <br/>
give you<br/>
&gt; a long message. Quite a few of the quests wont work until you go <br/>
through the<br/>
&gt; whole dialogue.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been exploring the pok for my last two sessions. Had a bit <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; a break between sessions due to having no power for most of a week. <br/>
&gt; Quite a storm here in the Central Coast district of California.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In talking with many NPC&#39;s I found them giving me about a paragraph <br/>
&gt; of monologue, breaking at a point which indicates more to come. <br/>
&gt; However, few have the &quot;continue&quot; command attached. Anyone know how <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; get the whole monologue from these NPC&#39;s?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I tried increasing the size of my dialogue box, but had no success. <br/>
&gt; Now I did have two boxes open, side by side, and only tried adding <br/>
&gt; length to the box in which the NPC&#39;s were talking. I may try a <br/>
wider, <br/>
&gt; longer box next time. Anyone have any experience in pok with this <br/>
&gt; problem?<br/>
