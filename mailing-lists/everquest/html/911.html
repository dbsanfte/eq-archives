<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436598917">I am at the yahoo group to unsubscribe from this spam list, however, <br/>
before I go I&#39;d like to remind you all to keep in mind that not only <br/>
are you buying these characters, you are also buying the players <br/>
reputation.... Just think a bit before dishing out $400 + on a high <br/>
level character - just why do you think they&#39;re getting rid of them <br/>
in the first place??? Anyone that wants to can find me on the &#39;non-<br/>
spamed&#39; necromancer, cleric or warriors lists....<br/>
