  <div><br></div><tt>I was hunting the gnolls at the Spires in SK when I learned 
  something <br>about them which others may find useful.<br><br>My current 
  technique for gnolling is to find one by himself, and hit <br>him with 
  Creeping Crud. That dot gets his attention, and begins doing <br>damage. I 
  then begin running away from the Spires, to get some <br>distance from any 
  possible gnoll back-up. Once I have the distance I <br>want, I root him and 
  hit him with another dot, Incinerate in this <br>case. I then rest to regain 
  mana. I will run, root, and dot him until <br>dead. With luck I have enough 
  mana left to rest only a short time <br>before I go get another.<br><br>I was 
  talking with my son-in-law while taking one gnoll, and rooted <br>the thing at 
  the spire rather than pulling him away. I guess I was <br>distracted. A second 
  gnoll came along and agroed on me, driving me <br>away. I knew I did not have 
  the mana to manage both, so ran south for <br>Lake Raithtear. I reached the 
  zone well ahead of them. I rested to <br>full capacity, with no gnolls in 
  sight. Didn&#39;t even zone.<br><br>I went back to get some more gnolls, but found 
  someone camping the <br>spire I had been working. I started to leave, honoring 
  his claim to <br>an abandoned camp, when a gnoll hit me from behind. I lead 
  him on a <br>fatal chase. The camper sent a tell regarding a perceived 
  violation <br>of camp courtesy, for which I appologized.<br><br>It seems that 
  the gnolls will abandon a chase after some time and <br>distance, but remember 
  you well. The second gnoll I had been involved <br>with agroed on me from a 
  considerable distance from the Spires. <br><br>So, gnoll hunters, keep in mind 
  that an injured gnoll has a long <br>memory, and even longer agro 
  range.<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
