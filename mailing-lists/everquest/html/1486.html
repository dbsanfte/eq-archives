<div id="ygrps-yiv-476970294">I think you hit it. How one approaches the game will deeply affect <br/>
the experience. I will try to keep your advice in mind when I lose my <br/>
perspective in playing.<br/>
<br/>
So far, it is a grand experience.<br/>

&gt; It seems to me that the only problem with twinking is that EQ has <br/>
become a<br/>
&gt; game about killing, levelling, and looting.  If it were truly a <br/>
roleplaying<br/>
&gt; game, this would not even be an issue.  If your main drive in the <br/>
game is<br/>
&gt; to get the bigger and better item (whatever it may be), you will <br/>
always<br/>
&gt; have low level players trying to be twinked and you will always have<br/>
&gt; jealous &quot;un-twinked&quot; players.  But when did the term &quot;roleplaying <br/>
game&quot;<br/>
&gt; turn into &quot;hack and loot&quot;?<br/>
