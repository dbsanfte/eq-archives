<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003361559">The offical word is Stormhammer players will be considered first for <br/>
the beta, followed by long time players from the other servers.  I <br/>
think I&#39;d rather be in on a later part of beta where the game is more <br/>
stable.  They do a lot of random things like raise or lower your <br/>
levels to test different stuff out.  Just check out the forums and <br/>
they will keep you informed about the exact details.<br/>
