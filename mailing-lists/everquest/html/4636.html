<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Best way to solo my Chanter <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892640726">it is always a good idea to work melee skills at low<br/>
levels.  in case at higher levels you draw aggro, it<br/>
is nice if you can survive until someone can peel<br/>
things off you or a heal gets cast.<br/>
<br/>
rememeber too an enchanter&#39;s pet is ok but not a great<br/>
one to rely on.  they are more used for acting as a<br/>
shield for you.  I am speaking in general terms too. <br/>
Granted if you have great gear and knowledge you may<br/>
be able to solo the enchanter better than others.<br/>
<br/>
The class was not designed to solo for too long and<br/>
most groups will love to have you<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

&gt; am now a couple small bubbles from 18. I have been<br/>
&gt; donating for a KEI <br/>
&gt; buff in PoK before I go there, and in turn have been<br/>
&gt; casting Breeze, <br/>
&gt; Mist, Strength, Rune I, Quickness, and Intellectual<br/>
&gt; Advancement <br/>
&gt; spells on other players in Kurn&#39;s to try and help<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been buffing my pet with Mist, Strength,<br/>
&gt; Quickness, Rune I, <br/>
&gt; and myself with those buffs plus Intellectual<br/>
&gt; Advancement and <br/>
&gt; Shielding. I use Root when there is only one target<br/>
&gt; around, and Mez <br/>
&gt; on a target when there are others in the area. Then<br/>
&gt; I hit them with <br/>
&gt; Chaotic Feedback and Choke, alternating until the<br/>
&gt; target breaks the <br/>
&gt; Mez/Root and then my pet finishes it off. I read<br/>
&gt; somewhere that this <br/>
&gt; is called &quot;Root and Nuke&quot; and that it isn&#39;t very<br/>
&gt; effective. I am <br/>
&gt; wondering if there are other ways I should be going<br/>
&gt; about trying to <br/>
&gt; fight as opposed to this? Should I be using my<br/>
&gt; dagger in combination <br/>
&gt; to the rooting/nuking? Any feedback would be great.<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
