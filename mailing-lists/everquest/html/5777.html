<div id="ygrps-yiv-527599621">I personally have found that getting a premium account with Allakhazam has been far more useful than any guides.<br/>
If you&#39;re going to spend money, why not spend it on allakhazam instead of buying a guide.<br/>
Although free guides would be ideal.<br/>
Oh, if any new members have messages pending, I apologize as yahoo will not let me approve or reject them at the moment. It&#39;s being pissy and saying the service is unavailable at the time.<br/>

In any case that any of these actually worked without the use of a <br/>
spell (I mean really fly through the air, whats to say the &quot;tip&quot; <br/>
isn&#39;t just buy a ring of levitation, find a high part to start and <br/>
run off) then the other possiblities is they are hacks or they are <br/>
random pathing issues, or they are basically just fancy use of hot <br/>
keys.   <br/>
<br/>
This is the *same person* who was previously selling a guide on how <br/>
to make plat (one I bought when I first started playing because I <br/>
was young and stupid then)- it basically was a bunch of quests I <br/>
could find on Allakazam that were repeatable and &quot;tips&quot; like kill <br/>
things and sell the items to players.<br/>
<br/>
In all cases, every guide like this in the past has been filled with <br/>
out dated, in accurate, or information that is not always <br/>
repeatable. <br/>
<br/>
An exploit of a bug is only useful if you can consistently repeat it.</div>
