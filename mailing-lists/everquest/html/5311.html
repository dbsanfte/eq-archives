they should be held in out-of-the-way zones, or in<br/>
another channel. If I was in that zone, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
want to watch the wedding spam in /ooc, and I don&#39;t<br/>
want to turn that channel off in case something<br/>
pertaining to the game is being said.<br/>
<br/>
I attended a wedding at the top of the SS tower once.<br/>
It was very nice, pretty area with all the dragons<br/>
around, and we weren&#39;t bothering anyone. ;)<br/>
