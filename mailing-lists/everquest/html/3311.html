 </span></blockquote>I have heard a lot of different views on this.  Many guilds have <br/>
banks, some have setup second accounts with just the banker and the <br/>
mules that the council control.  That way you just camp and open the <br/>
bank for whoever needs it.  It should be easy to arrange times, <br/>
bankers hours!  Can they be banned, sure.  Are they, no. <br/>
<br/>
I think that since they started nerfing a lot of the multi-questing <br/>
most guilds have cut back on this.  Many still loan out items but <br/>
most that I&#39;ve talked with would rather help you get what you need, <br/>
so you owe them!<br/>
<br/>
Verant should setup guild banks, maybe in conjunction with the <br/>
regular banks.  I would think that Verant would have setup something <br/>
like this a while ago.  As much as they push social interaction and <br/>
the high end game this would be a logical step.  I see very few <br/>
guildless high levels players, there isn&#39;t much you can do alone <br/>
after 50.  Sure, you can still hunt but raids are where it&#39;s at.</div>
