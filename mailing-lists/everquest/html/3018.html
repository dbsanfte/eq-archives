<div id="ygrps-yiv-37673525">Speaking of trade skills and great items, there is a new earring you can<br/>
make if your trade skills are high enough or you have a lot of friends.<br/>
 <br/>
To do this quest you need the trade skills to make 9 gifts. All 9 gifts are<br/>
tradable. Some gifts are harder than others. Once you have all 9 gifts, put<br/>
them in the forge and hit combine, you can not fail at this last combine.<br/>
You will receive an Earring that is druid only called Xanthe&#39;s Earring of<br/>
Nature with stats of AC 5 STR 8, STA 8, WIS 10, HP 55, mana 55, sv fire 7,<br/>
sv cold 7, sv magic 7 and recommended level 51. Druid only ! You also<br/>
receive the spell called Protection of the Cabbage. This spell is no drop<br/>
druid spell, single target version on the Protection of the Glades, level<br/>
59.<br/>
<br/>
If you are not a druid, you can take this earring to Fungus Grove and turn<br/>
the druid only earring into Rebecca and she will give you a new one. The all<br/>
/ all earring is called Earring of the Solstice and the stats for the<br/>
earring are AC 5, STA 5, WIS 8, INT 8, HP 55, mana 55, sv fire 5, sv cold 5,<br/>
sv magic 5 and recommended level is 51. All - All<br/>
<br/>
Many of the trade skill combines are not trivial to a 250 skilled tradesman.<br/>
So be prepared to work to get this item. My guild made about 18 of these<br/>
Earrings this past weekend. We all worked as a team and collected<br/>
components, bought gems and killed mobs for the needed items. <br/>
<br/>
I would say of the 9 gifts needed, the hardest gift is the Ceremonial<br/>
Solstice Robe. This robe is selling on my server for 10,000 platinum. I have<br/>
sold 2 of them for my guild. My guild mate has a tailoring skill of 241 and<br/>
it is good to see that he is making some good money for all the hard work he<br/>
has done over the last 18 months. He also completed his 8th prayer shawl. <br/>
<br/>
Another guild mate has a smithing skill of 244, but 3 weeks before this, his<br/>
skill was below 50. Smithing is a lot easier to raise that tailoring.<br/>
Tailoring takes forever to raise. Could you imagine clicking 150 combines<br/>
with a skill of 240 and not getting 1 skill increase? This is how it is for<br/>
tailoring.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want to bore anyone by copying and pasting the entire quest, but I<br/>
will paste just 2 of the 9 gifts you need to give you an idea how complex<br/>
this quest is. Just notice how many combines are not trivial at 250 skill. I<br/>
was in the group when they were making the robes and I saw the first 20 robe<br/>
combines they had 3 successful tries out of 20 and the next time he was 5<br/>
for 20. <br/>
