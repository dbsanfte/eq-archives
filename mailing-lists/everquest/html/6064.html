<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017883162">A CLERIC&#39;S DAY<br/>
<br/>
The morning comes too soon.<br/>
<br/>
It was another bad night, tortured by the haunted screams, and the <br/>
vivid images of the previous day. My heart is tired, but I must not <br/>
falter. I met my comrades on the field. Still and quiet. Only the <br/>
crickets give evidence of life beyond our keep. Today will be another <br/>
rough day. I bolster my faith, surrounding myself with it like a <br/>
piece of impregnable armor. I know that many will go out to meet <br/>
their death and only a few will return. For all our sakes, I must put <br/>
that aside and mourn later. For now it is war. I am needed to give <br/>
heart, faith and healing to my comrades. If I must, I will help as <br/>
well. Not that someone like me could do much. I pray to Tunare for <br/>
strength and guidance.<br/>
<br/>
All communications are in and the report is not good. Our scouts have <br/>
given us a target. An army of orcs is controlling the southern path <br/>
letting us know that we shall not pass. Our troops are ready to move <br/>
out. I only pray that everyone will return. I look at the faces of <br/>
those with me, those in my group and those beyond. They are anxious. <br/>
They know the risks and yet the shouts and glory of victory drive <br/>
them like a cruel master. They look to me for comfort and to keep <br/>
them going. I hope I do not fail.<br/>
<br/>
We reach the gate, but the enemy is nowhere to be seen. The stink is <br/>
fresh. Do we venture forth or stay behind where it is safe? Our <br/>
orders are clear, we must continue forward. We must keep them from <br/>
penning between our keep and their forces. Group by group we venture <br/>
forward along the path.<br/>
<br/>
A flash of light and some music. I can&#39;t move. The brutishness of our <br/>
foes keeps me rooted in place. All around me I hear the screams of <br/>
agony mixed with their terrible howls of victory. The orcs have <br/>
surrounded us cutting off our escape route. I see my friends and <br/>
fellow fighters going down one by one under the cruel swords of the <br/>
brutish orcs. I am helpless. I see them looking to for help and it <br/>
breaks my heart. How cruel this enemy is, to leave me with sight and <br/>
hearing, yet deprive me of movement.<br/>
<br/>
I feel my hands start to glow. I begin the motions, healing as I can, <br/>
trying to heal those around me that are still standing. I once again <br/>
summon my faith to provide a bunker for those left as I race to save <br/>
those who may yet be living. Frantically, I race against time to save <br/>
one then another hoping I can stay strong. Our enemies, those that <br/>
threaten my homeland, are strong. I am not sure how much longer I can <br/>
hold out. I can feel the energy draining away.<br/>
<br/>
Behind me I hear the sound of fresh troops bearing down on us and I <br/>
send a hurried prayer of thanks to Tunare. Re-enforcements have <br/>
arrived. Somewhere inside me, I find the power to continue healing <br/>
and bolstering as much as I can. I watch as our enemies slowly fall <br/>
beneath our forces until there are none left. Gratefully, I regroup. <br/>
Looking around, I see that most of us still live. Able to return to <br/>
our keep victorious.<br/>
<br/>
There are celebrations, joyful reunions and tales to be told. I hang <br/>
back. Today we were lucky; tomorrow we will face death again. How can <br/>
we hold out? I don&#39;t know, but I cannot give up the faith. <br/>
<br/>
It is my calling.<br/>
My vocation.<br/>
<br/>
I am a cleric.</div>
