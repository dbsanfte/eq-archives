I&#39;m new to this club and my name is Ron and I&#39;m a EQ addict lol.&nbsp; I just 
thought I&#39;d introduce myself to everyone and give a little background info about 
myself.&nbsp; Well I&#39;ve been playing EQ for about 2 years now and I love 
it.&nbsp; I play on Ayonae Ro and my main is a 29 troll warrior and I also have 
a 25 iksar necro, 12 human monk, and the rest of my characters are just throw 
away ones, I wanted to experiment to see how the different classes play 
like.&nbsp; Well I&#39;m also in the navy out here in the gulf and I&#39;m stationed in 
Everett, WA.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t played EQ since March 2nd (we left for westpac 
March 3rd) and I won&#39;t be able to play until we get back sometime in middle 
November.&nbsp; I have with me here on the ship just about every EQ book/guide 
that came out lol from Kunark to Luclin to the EQ Atlas and the EQ spellbook..I 
read them whenever I have EQ withdrawls (which is everyday).&nbsp; So yeah I 
just can&#39;t wait to come back to the states and play again.&nbsp; Well I guess 
I&#39;d better get going for now, take care everyone and happy 
hunting!</font></span></div>
