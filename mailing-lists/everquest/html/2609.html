<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It took me about 18 months to get my very first 
character to level 40. An enchanter is not a good choice for a first character, 
although it did make me a much better player in the long run. That was before 
breeze came out too, so it was ultra hard. I have had my current character for 
quite some time. I kind of twinked him with some basic stuff like banded armor 
and a mino axe but nothing extravagant. I got him from level 23 to 30 in about a 
week though when I started playing him again. Of course, Xegony was one of the 
first servers and everyone is totally twinked and power-leveled on that server. 
There are some aspects of the game I know a lot about, like the classes and 
their roles in a group. I know a lot about the enchanter and wizard classes as I 
have a level 40 enchanter and wizard. That is good that you are trying out 
different classes but eventually you will have to figure out which one to 
concentrate on. What classes are you playing?</font></div>

  <br>&gt; Hi, I bought Everquest the first day it came out. I<br>&gt; am not a 
  very good EQ<br>&gt; player. I would consider myself ultra competent 
  in<br>&gt; group battles, but in<br>&gt; other aspects of the game I am 
  decidedly mediocre. I<br>&gt; have never gotten a<br>&gt; character past level 
  40. My first character was an<br>&gt; Erudite Enchanter by the<br>&gt; name of 
  Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to<br>&gt; level 40 after two years 
  or<br>&gt; so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which was my<br>&gt; 
  friends character but I<br>&gt; own it. I just started playing again after 
  giving up<br>&gt; on the game and playing<br>&gt; DAOC. Eventually I gave up 
  all MMORPGS deciding they<br>&gt; were a waste of time.<br>&gt; About a week 
  ago, I decided to give EQ another<br>&gt; chance and have decided that<br>&gt; 
  it has improved a great deal. I am now playing a<br>&gt; Human Ranger who is 
  level<br>&gt; 30. I really like the character. His buffs and<br>&gt; damage 
  spells are great. I<br>&gt; guess I could use some help on how to be a good 
  EQ<br>&gt; player. I have been<br>&gt; playing for about two years and I feel 
  like I know<br>&gt; absolutely nothing about<br>&gt; the game. I have never 
  belonged to a good guild or<br>&gt; anything. I play on the<br>&gt; Xegony 
  server.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;
