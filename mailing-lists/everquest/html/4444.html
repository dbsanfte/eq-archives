<div id="ygrps-yiv-829599263"><p>My main is just level 52, so I don&#39;t go into the planes a whole lot. But when I do, it&#39;s with guildies in PoJ, or zone-in of PoI. I&#39;ve not had a lot of trouble in Innovation yet, but in PoJ, those rats get me ever time I med ( well, almost every time) hehe. So, I&#39;m currently saving for a horse. The ppl I hunt with are tired of saving my butt, lol.
