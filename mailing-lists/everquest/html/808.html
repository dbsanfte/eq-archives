 hehee I thought I was the only one bothered by it. Yes...I find it rude if <br/>
 people inspect and don&#39;t ask first. That is like some stranger coming to my <br/>
 door and walking in and checking out my CD Collection hehe<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How? I&#39;m totally confused?  Some starnger sees you on the street - he can see <br/>
your Boots, your Cloak, your jewelry, your hat.  Do you run away from <br/>
everyone who looks at you in the real world?  Someone walking into my house <br/>
and checking out my CD collection would be rude as hell I agree, but in EQ we <br/>
have no homes, so we keep all our possessions in the bank and in item slots <br/>
and containers.  NO ONE CAN SEE THESE!!! As it should be.  I am dumfounded <br/>
that people in EQ are upset that people can see what they have ON THIER <br/>
BODIES.<br/>
