<div id="ygrps-yiv-370514915">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
There is a new survey for the EverQuest community. <br/>
<br/>
More and more items are becoming NO DROP now, meaning you cannot trade or sell them, and since Verant pushes forward about the game having a &quot;player based economy&quot;, the NO DROP items really ruin this concept.. There is a way to prevent &quot;twinking&quot; and still have the items availible for trade, an alternative to NO DROP. Put level blocks on equipment, meaning you cannot use/wear the equipment until you are high enough level for the item, the level will be somewhere below the level you need to get it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
Possible answers are:<br/>
<br/>
o NO DROP is the way to go.<br/>
o Hmm, level caps on items, that&#39;s better..<br/>
o Why not both at once?<br/>
                      <br/>
