<div id="ygrps-yiv-403568725">Thank you for all that posted on ideas...and I do see that most of you are<br/>
right about players being cheaper...I came from a game that players were too<br/>
high of price and the best thing to do is to find the stuff yourself or find<br/>
some one that didn&#39;t have a clue what they had...every since I played EQ...I<br/>
have found it to be a breath of fresh air....I have not found one greifer,<br/>
scammer or just a pure pain in the arse. I have found alot of friendly<br/>
players that do help out new players...</div>
