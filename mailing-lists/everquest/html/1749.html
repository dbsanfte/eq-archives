<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676364971">Generally speaking, you don&#39;t get as much money when you solo.  You <br/>
get a lot more money when you group.  Sure, you probably don&#39;t get <br/>
everything for yourself but because the groups can pull fast and <br/>
kill &#39;em, you generally get more money that way even if you are doing <br/>
alpha looting.  If you can get into a group, you probably can make <br/>
money that way.  Try the aviaks group in SK.  You can probably do it <br/>
at 19.  And yeah, Lena&#39;s correct, if you can get a few more levels <br/>
you can group in paw or whatever cuz they drop a lot of FS weapons.  <br/>
Though, killing gnolls can get really boring after a while.<br/>
