<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426423784">Well, according to the official rules it&#39;s only KSing if the other person<br/>
engaged the mob first. Attacking a mezzed, snared, or rooted mob that you<br/>
did not engage first is KSing (if you get the kill). Sometimes it gets into<br/>
gray areas. For instance if a mob comes and attacks you after someone else<br/>
aggrod it and the people who were originally attacking it don&#39;t come to get<br/>
it or help you and you have to kill it to defend yourself then it&#39;s not<br/>
KSing as the mob is considered abandoned.<br/>
Some people still do camp checks. If you camp a spot for a long time people<br/>
can still come in and kill a mob that you are waiting for and the GMs can&#39;t<br/>
do anything about it bc it&#39;s not against the rules. The reason for these<br/>
rules is bc it&#39;s too difficult to figure out who was camping a spot first.<br/>
The only time I have moved in on a camp that someone else was at was when a<br/>
lvl 65 was claiming the entire undead section of lower guk and I wanted to<br/>
hunt there for xp. My group moved into one room and the jerk tried to pull<br/>
mobs that we were already fighting. (he started pulling the entire dungeon<br/>
over other people and then killing them).<br/>

I think you&#39;re right about KS&#39;ing, I may add if someone looks like they<br/>
are waiting for a spawn, and you find out they are, taking it would be a<br/>
KS IMHO.  I haven&#39;t played in a while, do people still do camp checks<br/>
when they enter a zone?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t think you did anything wrong..you basically<br/>
pulled for camp 1 even though you did not mean to and all the group did<br/>
was let you get pounded so you ran off to save your life which is what I<br/>
would of done in that situation.  That group might of all been afk<br/>
(doubt it) and when they got back on they thought that you trained them<br/>
on purpose...but anyway if all their gonna do in the game is cause you<br/>
problems then they are all immature and don&#39;t have much of a life.  If<br/>
it happens again you should take a screen shot of what they said and<br/>
tell a gm about it..if he asks for the proof then you have it all right<br/>
there...it&#39;ll take like a week to get a response back but thats the only<br/>
sure way to take care of this problem...that or either ignore them.<br/>
This kind of thing happened to me in Echo Caverns..I was wondering<br/>
around looking for a spot to solo when this needlite comes out and<br/>
attacks me from behind.  I see a group of 3 people nearby in the<br/>
needlite camp and I tell them I have a mob for you guys but all they did<br/>
was sit there.they had no mobs in their area.  I tell them again but I<br/>
still get no response.  By this time I lost about 2 bubs of health so I<br/>
said screw it and killed it off.  Later I get a shout telling everyone<br/>
in the zone I am a KSer..now let me get this right isn&#39;t KSing killing a<br/>
mob that someone else is already fighting?  Or am I wrong?<br/>
