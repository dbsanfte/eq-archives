<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429487459">I&#39;m not sure about the ATI Radeon, but I know the GeForce 5 FX requires a more powerful power supply than the average video card. So keep that in mind when building your system, you might need a larger power supply or else the system shuts itself off and has other problems. My father found this out the hard way when he ordered a new PC from HP. They put in the GeForce 5 but did not increase the power supply so he had to go buy a new power supply in order for his computer to work.<br/>

My system specs are a Pentium 4 1.8Ghz and a 400mhz FSB  with 1024MB of RAM and a 128MB ATI Radeon 9200 video card.  It seemed to run the beta version of EQ2 quite well with minimal lag in most cases, so if you&#39;re system is commensurate to that, you shouldn&#39;t have a problem.  <br/>

I am, however, building a new system that will be a Pentium 4 2.4Ghz and a 533mhz FSB with 1024MB of RAM and a 256MB ATI Radeon 9600XT video card.  I expect good things from it when I&#39;m done.   I think EQ2 should run quite nicely on it.<br/>
