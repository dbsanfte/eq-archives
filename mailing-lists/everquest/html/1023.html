&gt; Why Clan Spiritslammer isn&#39;t Uber!<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; ------<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen some posts from people putting Clan Spiritslammer in the same<br/>
&gt; Uber neighborhood as the Watchers, SR and LOH.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well just to throw a dose of reality on all of you, here is a list why<br/>
&gt; Clan Spiritslammer is NOT uber (all true).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Planning a Severilous raid 9/10s of the guild had to ask what zone he<br/>
&gt; was in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) Getting a group of 6 together for Disco in Sebelis. Upon arrival, 4 of<br/>
&gt; the 6 forgot their Seb keys at the bank. One of them forgot to camp his<br/>
&gt; Seb key altogether.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) At a Vox raid, our cleric had to heal his party from the pit while<br/>
&gt; fending off bears and spiders.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4) One of our warriors asked and got irate at a shaman&#39;s pet when the pet<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t answer a request for a port.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5) A group of us asked a Necro&#39;s pet once for a corpse summons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6) We constantly make the mistake of &quot;Well SR can do it with 1 group, how<br/>
&gt; hard can it be?!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 7) One of druids has fallen into the same pit trap in Howling Stones 9<br/>
&gt; times.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of our warriors, after receiving a 10 minute lecture about being<br/>
&gt; careful of where you walk in Sol A, promptly took a nose dive into the<br/>
&gt; lava 30 seconds after zoning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 9) The same warrior then proceeded to take 15 more lava baths in Sol A.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 10) We always forget we need to be in the same zone for corpse summoning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 11) The guides and GMs of Brell know all our names by heart because we<br/>
&gt; manage to find every single terminal bug in any zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 12) Our justification for doing Chardok zone when we were all in our late<br/>
&gt; 40s was &quot;Well we can always just zone out&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 13) Same for Sebelis.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 14) Same for Howling Stones.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 15) One of our druids was so worried about forgetting his Howling Stones<br/>
&gt; key, he accidently destroyed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 16) We&#39;ve sold an SMR, a Dragoon Dirk, a Mith 2 Hander, a TBB, a Kunzar<br/>
&gt; Cloak, a Mammoth Cloak, and an Evil Eye Bag (full at the time too) to<br/>
&gt; various merchants all around Norrath.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 17) Our druids (all of them) always have to ask &quot;Which evac is it for<br/>
&gt; EJ?&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1 In Sky we killed eachother off for corpse summoning and revives only to<br/>
&gt; discover that there was no one for corpse summoning and revives left.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 19) Our paladin (cough) looks like an Ewok in Kylong armor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 20) No single person in our guild quite knows the entire family tree...<br/>
&gt; even after reading it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 21) We can do Fear in less then 3 hours, but can&#39;t get to any place in<br/>
&gt; Velious in under 5.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 22) To this day, when someone says &quot;Can we pull something?&quot; 3 people head<br/>
&gt; out in different directions to pull.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 23) Camping the AC in south ro, we were KSed by a 46th level solo mage<br/>
&gt; (there were 5 of us, most all 55th levelish, grouped).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 24) When a particular druid of ours attempts to port us, it is truly a<br/>
&gt; mystery if we will actually port somewhere, port to the desired location,<br/>
&gt; or watch the druid gate there while we go no where.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 25) While trying to port to Gfay once, we ported to Hate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 26) Most people power level their alts and lower level guildmembers by<br/>
&gt; helping to kill a mob they are fighting on a consistant basis. We just<br/>
&gt; train ours and go conveniently link dead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 27) We once petitioned that the Noble Dojorn in Sky dropped a Runed Totem<br/>
&gt; Staff. We later found out that Thorondar gave the Noble Dojorn the staff<br/>
&gt; so it would have a worse damage/delay.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2 We constantly sell extra loot and then try to buy it back when we<br/>
&gt; realize that we actually needed that item.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 29) We can kill Trakanon, however most of our members have died to green<br/>
&gt; cons while trying to cross most of the zones in Kunark and Velious.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 30) One of the criteria for membership is &quot;What&#39;s the largest train you<br/>
&gt; have ever pulled?&quot;. Well we want to be the best at something /shrug. (P.S.<br/>
&gt; - Conanb still owns this record /rude).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 31) One of our warriors was killed by the same Avocet 5 times.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 32) One of our paladins (sniff) was killed by Dorn 7 times (each one a<br/>
&gt; purposeful attack).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 33) One of our druids tried to kite Grim Feather at 20th level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 34) One of our druids has said the word &quot;ow&quot; approximately 2000 times MORE<br/>
&gt; then any other person.... ever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 35) One of our warriors and one of our mages were lost in Lake Rathe for<br/>
&gt; over 2 hours trying to find the SK zone. They kept swimming around the<br/>
&gt; zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 36) Our 60th level shaman still can&#39;t find his way through everfrost to<br/>
&gt; find Halas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 37) A raid newbie once asked me &quot;What&#39;s a death touch&quot; to which Cazic<br/>
&gt; Thule replied &quot;KRUUNCH!&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3 One of our paladins (hurumph) once got a rez and ran off to rejoin the<br/>
&gt; fight.....forgetting to loot his corpse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 39) One of our paladins (like we have more then 1) once got rezzed and<br/>
&gt; proceeded to continue to pull Fear.... naked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 40) All of our clerics and druids have Sarnak Battle Shields but none of<br/>
&gt; our melee do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 41) Cartumandua continually takes most of our phat lewt and just oggles it<br/>
&gt; an hour out of every day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 42) One of our clerics continually complains about the crappy BP he has<br/>
&gt; (he has a Trak BP).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 43) We have one high level enchanter, and he is on heavy medication (he<br/>
&gt; says it&#39;s for his back).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 44) Our bard seems to go LD only when playing his levitate or EB song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 45) Our other enchanter goes LD anytime the word &quot;incoming&quot; is said in<br/>
&gt; guild/group/say/ooc/shout.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 46) Ruut (our troll SK) joined the guild because he heard we got phat lewt<br/>
&gt; alot and thought we were all pretty skinny compared to him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 47) None of us day to day can decide what the hell faction we want in<br/>
&gt; Velious, so we usually wind up at Karnors.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4 One a few occasions we&#39;ve told a guildmate we&#39;re camping the Hand (in<br/>
&gt; Karnors) and they proceeded to go to Lguk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 49) One of our Necros paid 2K for a purchaseable spell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 50) One of our Necros spent 3 weeks researching a purchaseable spell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I thought it was pretty funny.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
