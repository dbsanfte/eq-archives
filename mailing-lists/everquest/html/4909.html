<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] What game features would you like to see added? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-605318257">Good point. The only good thing I thought of for corpse runs was that you<br/>
can be summoned back to your corpse so you don&#39;t have to make the trek to<br/>
wherever you died all over again. But yeah, if you can&#39;t find your corpse<br/>
it&#39;s a royal pain.<br/>
Would you have it so you have all your gear but can still be rezzed? or<br/>
would you just eliminate rezzes?<br/>

&gt; &gt; differently?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Definitely I would get rid of the corpse-hunting. I understand losing exp<br/>
