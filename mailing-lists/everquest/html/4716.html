&gt;      OK, You can train your trade skills ( baking, Tailoring, ect) <br/>
To <br/>
&gt; 21 and after a few free points it does start charging. Languages <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; other skills like 1 hb 2 hb and slashing can be trained way on past <br/>
&gt; 21 at your trainer depending on your level.  My druid has always <br/>
used <br/>
&gt; a 1hb When I decided to het a scimitar at lv 48 I trained as high <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; I could and it was costing several plat a point  I paid over a <br/>
&gt; hundred to gain skill level at trainer.  <br/>
&gt;     I have been on almost 4 years and it has been this way the <br/>
entire <br/>
&gt; time I have  played. I beleive the reason trade skills are capped <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; 21 is to create player based economy for and to reward those <br/>
willing <br/>
&gt; to go out and put the work in something.<br/>
