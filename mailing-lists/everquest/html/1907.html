<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766938980">I am a halfling druid, lvl 26. I currently hunt craig spiders in east <br/>
karanas to get the nice silk drops. I use this to build my tailoring <br/>
skills. Soon I will no longer get exp with these hunts, and I will <br/>
have advanced my tailoring as much as possible with craig spiders <br/>
silk. So, I am wondering where I can go to make some money.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I can go to Neriak and camp guards for their 2pp bronze <br/>
weapons, but wonder if there is anything equally profitable which <br/>
will also net me some exp and perhaps let me explore some place new. <br/>
<br/>
any suggestions?<br/>
