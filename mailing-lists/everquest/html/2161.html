<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074218085">What about the brutes in Warsliks Woods? From what I have seen on the <br/>
Atlas they are a bit lower level than FM. Anyone familiar with the <br/>
brutes in this area?<br/>

&gt; You offer good advice, but I have to add a warning about the <br/>
Frontier<br/>
&gt; Mountains zone. You mentioned having Camouflage memmed, which, <br/>
while a good<br/>
&gt; idea while travelling in any dangerous zone, can lull you into a <br/>
false sense<br/>
&gt; of security in FM (Dreadlands too). I say that because the Mountain <br/>
Giants<br/>
&gt; are not fooled by Camo, or Invis -- they see right through it, and <br/>
would not<br/>
&gt; be a good chance meeting for a level 29 druid travelling alone. I <br/>
think some<br/>
&gt; of the Goblin Casters and perhaps the Burynai Cenobites can also <br/>
see through<br/>
&gt; Camo/Invis.<br/>
