<b>Subject:</b> Question about quest item again <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137748018">I previously wrote that I had some sort of gnoll<br/>
fur quest item.  I think I tricked myself (i&#39;m not playing eq now and couldn&#39;t check).<br/>
<br/>
I think I had a gnoll fang that I couldn&#39;t sell.<br/>
(Hopefully I&#39;m remembering correctly)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know what to do with a gnoll fang?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
