<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631678090">Well, don&#39;t ask for items. People will see that as begging. It is ok to ask<br/>
for buffs very nicely. But asking for items is frowned upon. Wait until you<br/>
get some money from killing things and selling their loot and then offer to<br/>
buy things. And never be too aggressive about asking if someone will PL you.<br/>
It might make people want to avoid you. And don&#39;t be upset if people refuse.<br/>
Sometimes people just aren&#39;t in the mood to PL.<br/>
