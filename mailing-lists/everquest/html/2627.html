<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801520094">Don&#39;t forget buffing for donations. At lvl 30 Rangers get sow. So you can<br/>
sow for donations if no druids, beastlords, or shamans are around.<br/>

I guess the obvious ways I can think of are to kill lots of green mobs. Camp<br/>
items in dungeons. Practice trade skills. I have spent a great deal of time<br/>
in the Highpass Basement and when I am in a group where everyone is twinked,<br/>
they often let me get all the loot.</div>
