<div id="ygrps-yiv-58438086">I sort of know what you mean. Even if I&#39;m already in a group I get people<br/>
sending me tells asking for a heal or a bind. They&#39;ll expect me to leave my<br/>
group and go find them to bind or heal. but most people are polite about it.<br/>
If I ask for clarity or breeze I generally offer to donate or pay for said<br/>
service. Or I offer to return a buff if my buffs are good enough.<br/>
I mostly have people outside my group being polite. but when I have people<br/>
in my group they can be rather rude. Like I was grouped with his one kid<br/>
(who I later found out was only 9 yrs old) who kept saying &quot;Heal me. HEAL<br/>
ME!&quot; when he wasn&#39;t even halfway down and I&#39;d already told him I was out of<br/>
mana. I had said to other people I swore he was only 10. but then his father<br/>
told me he was 9.<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t think kids that age should play EQ. Especially when they<br/>
could potentially screw things up for other people&#39;s characters.<br/>
go figure.<br/>
