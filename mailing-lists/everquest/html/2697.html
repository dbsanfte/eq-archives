<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644799861"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There was a recent survey done and posted on Everlore about women in<br/>
&gt; EQ.  It turns out that the majority of players are male, big<br/>
&gt; surprise.  And that almost 50% of all female characters are really<br/>
&gt; guys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah. I know several guys playing females.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Women generally play female characters, but even here in fantasyland<br/>
&gt; the are some players and guilds that don&#39;t take a female character<br/>
&gt; seriously!  The male character seems to get more respect and<br/>
&gt; leadership positions in these situations.  So some women play male<br/>
&gt; characters and see a difference in how they are treated by these same<br/>
&gt; people!  It&#39;s sad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. I do play a male character as my primary because people listen to him<br/>
more.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; And even I have been known to be soft on the ladies.  Hey, it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; game of Chivalry after all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to admit, I&#39;m sometimes nicer to the cute little female elves. :-)<br/>
But I try to treat people equally. When it comes to setting up rules and<br/>
stuff, I don&#39;t even pay attention to the gender of the person making<br/>
suggestions at all.<br/>
