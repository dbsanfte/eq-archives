  <div><br></div><tt>Su,<br><br>Unfortunately, there are always jerks.&nbsp; 
  Unfortunately, there are always fizzles.&nbsp; And mobs hitting the cleric, 
  etc. etc.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have as good of a solution to the jerks as was 
  volunteered earlier(make a character on your server and yell at the jerks you 
  have to deal with), but I do have one to show all in your group you are doing, 
  or at least trying to do, your job as a healer.&nbsp; The solution is set up 
  and use macros.&nbsp; At level 28, I have two main heal macros.&nbsp; Each one 
  states I am healing or greater healing the person I have targeted.&nbsp; It 
  also tells them to stay close as sometimes folks walk out of range of a 
  heal.&nbsp; This is my basic macro set up.&nbsp; You have five lines to work 
  with in a macro and my greater heal spell is in slot 1:<br><br>/sit off<br>/g 
  Casting Greater Heal on %t.&nbsp; Stay close friend.<br>/cast 1<br><br>I 
  include /sit off so I can hit the macro whether I am medding or not.&nbsp; The 
  /g will groupsay whatever you want.&nbsp; %t returns your target&#39;s name.&nbsp; 
  /Cast 1 casts the spell in your first spell slot.&nbsp; You can do /cast 1 to 
  /cast 8 for any of your slots.<br><br>I also have macros to state a mob is &quot;On 
  me, can&#39;t heal&quot; or &quot;I just cast Divine Aura, I can&#39;t heal - get this mob off 
  me&quot; or &quot;Zone zone zone.&nbsp; Your cleric is on his way to zone!&quot;&nbsp; By the 
  way, I don&#39;t always run for zone, but it sure gets their attention that we 
  might have a problem.<br><br>I find if you tell folks what you are doing, they 
  stop asking.&nbsp; Also, any time I med, I call out that I am medding and how 
  much mana I have.&nbsp; My macro for that is:<br><br>/book<br>/g 
  Medding.&nbsp; My mana is at...<br><br>Then I tell them 50% or whatever it 
  happens to be.<br><br>Maybe some don&#39;t like the fact I say over and over again 
  what I am doing, but I find most appreciate it.&nbsp; I can&#39;t please 
  everyone.&nbsp; And when someone asks why you Greater Healed so and so 4 times 
  in a row, I say I didn&#39;t, I had a bad fizzle streak.&nbsp; They can see how 
  quickly each of my healing messages came and realize themselves what happened 
  - a good thing.&nbsp; Enough.&nbsp; Too much caffeine.<br><br>Good 
  luck,<br><br>Robiinton<br>Piemur<br><br><br><br>Message: 12<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;

  order<br><br>Yeah, but I needed the xp and didn&#39;t want to leave Highpass. If 
  I&#39;d pissed<br>him off he could&#39;ve easily disbanded me. I&#39;ve had people disband 
  me from<br>group bc they were pissed off that I couldn&#39;t heal them in time 
  (like one<br>time in Crushbone when I kept getting hit by Legos-- the group 
  leader didn&#39;t<br>believe me that I kept getting hit. She claimed that I wasn&#39;t 
  even trying to<br>heal her).<br>Although onetime we had a group leader who was 
  such a jerk that we all sent<br>tells to each other and regrouped without him. 
  We had to put him on ignore.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
