<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074565115">I do not understand why you do not have a weapon? I have played in Qyenos<br/>
for many hours if you head to north Qyenos or Qyenos hills the gnoll pups<br/>
and decaying skeletons ( both can carry weapons) should con green to you at<br/>
lvl 7.<br/>

Thanks for all of the advice.  I think maybe just being stuck in Qyenos<br/>
without a weopon and not being able to find anything that isn&#39;t green to me<br/>
to kill is what is discouraging me. I head to Surefall and everything is<br/>
Red. Are there no more blues or yellows to kill? I&#39;ll keep looking, but<br/>
thanks for all of the information.<br/>
 <br/>
