<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010856944">The techs asked for several files to assess my situation. Haven&#39;t <br/>
gotten anything conclusive back as yet.<br/>
<br/>
The text of error 1001 is essentially saying that I cannot connect to <br/>
the login server. It is not the active character one.<br/>
<br/>
The problem last year resolved after a patch. <br/>
<br/>
Going to give the techs a few more days. Don&#39;t want to mess with too <br/>
much then have a lot to correct.<br/>

&gt; What is the error 1001? is that the active char one?<br/>
&gt; You can obviously hit the internet since you posted<br/>
&gt; here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not aware of any connection issues.  What was the<br/>
&gt; problem last year when it happened?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IF all else fails, maybe reinstall EQ, maybe you have<br/>
&gt; a corrupt file.  Have you messed with the EQ skins at<br/>
&gt; all?<br/>
&gt; Or maybe even the eqclient.ini file.  If so, rename<br/>
&gt; the ini file and it will create a new one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you get this write back or look for me on Yahoo<br/>
&gt; chat as rlebeau65.  Not sure but maybe I can help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Talk about not being productive on a day off....lol<br/>

&gt; &gt; Still can&#39;t get on today. Third day without EQ fix.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Getting bad. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thinking Earth and Beyond looks promising. Wrote the<br/>
&gt; &gt; techs for <br/>
&gt; &gt; support. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Had this happen last year. Three days in a row. All<br/>
&gt; &gt; my days off. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sucked big time. The error corrected itself,<br/>
&gt; &gt; somehow. I just don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; want to wait. Missing game time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; AAArrghh!<br/>
