<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I just got the short sword of morin at level 32, it 
is 6 22. I have a crystalized sword which is 11 29. Which one should I put in my 
off hand? I have the ssom in my regular hand and the c sword in my off hand and 
he seems to attack almost endlessly without stopping. It seems like I need to 
get another low delay weapon in my off hand. </font></div></html></div>
