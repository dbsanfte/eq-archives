&gt; Ok.. So which one of these is the Southeast camp?<br/>
&gt; Camp 1, 2, or 3?<br/>
&gt; I never got killed by Qued, but I did kick his arse plenty of times.<br/>
&gt; Next time I see him I&#39;ll kick it again, just for you. :-)<br/>
&gt; I got irritated bc PegLeg and his group conned green to me yet they<br/>
&gt; managed<br/>
&gt; to kill me.<br/>
&gt; I think they were waaay underconning.<br/>
