<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489653976">Cool!<br/>
My brother has one of those cases with the light thingy that responds to<br/>
sound.<br/>
Unfortunately the computer doesn&#39;t work. It keeps rebooting itself for no<br/>
reason. The microsoft error report thing said there was some driver conflict<br/>
causing it but we don&#39;t know what driver it is and it often reboots before<br/>
we can get far enough to tell. Well, that and my brother is not willing to<br/>
take the time to mess with it and expects me to fix it for him.<br/>
I know we had problems before and had to pay the computer shop we bought it<br/>
from to fix a problem but it turns out they were the reason the problem<br/>
exisited. One of their employees loaded software and drivers on it that were<br/>
causing it to not work before and I don&#39;t know if they left some of it or<br/>
what. Really frustrating.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; I have yet to meet someone who has not lagged in the bazaar.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I play on a laptop: P4 1.19GHz, 512MB RAM, GeoForce2Go video card,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Windows XP. I have a TERRIBLE lag in Bazaar, and sometimes in PoK.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You guys think I should upgrade my video card? I know Sony doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; support playing on a laptop, but aside from the lag in those two<br/>
&gt; &gt; areas, it&#39;s working quite well.<br/>
