<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] New UI <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890862661">I&#39;m DLing the patch right now. Says I have over 3 hours left. 21.6k<br/>
connection can really suck sometimes.<br/>
I hope it doesn&#39;t lag too badly. I wonder if my darkelf wizard is kos in<br/>
jaggedpine.. I hope not.<br/>
I had to completely delete my virusscan software from my comp bc even when I<br/>
turned the stupid thing off it kept popping up to tell me that it detected a<br/>
virus on my mother&#39;s computer. Sheesh. Talk about annoying. And I would tell<br/>
it to shut up and a few min later it would do it again. I couldn&#39;t get it to<br/>
stop so I finally uninstalled it. It reinstalled itself and I had to flat<br/>
out delete the thing.<br/>
Anyone know of good virus software that isn&#39;t annoying like that?<br/>
luv,<br/>
