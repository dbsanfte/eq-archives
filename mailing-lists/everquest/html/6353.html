<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471579071">What server?<br/>
I don&#39;t remember exactly where I was around that level, I believe I was<br/>
in Paludal Caverns until 25, I don&#39;t remember what level I was in<br/>
Highkeep Hold, but it was somewhere in the 20&#39;s. <br/>
LDoN adventures are great for experience. As soon as my 18 warrior gets<br/>
high enough for LDoN then that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do with him... Got to get him<br/>
caught up with my 41 SK and 45 Necro... Hehehe<br/>
<br/>
If you are on Tribunal (Ayonea Ro) Keep an eye out for Razzekx ( I don&#39;t<br/>
know HOW the x got there, must have happened when they incorporated the<br/>
servers) He&#39;s my 18 Warrior and I&#39;ll group with you if you want...<br/>
