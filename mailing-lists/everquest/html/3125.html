 </span></blockquote>Loved the article.  I used to be subscribed to the Rialto but I can&#39;t <br/>
keep up with that and a.g.everquest too.  That come off the SCA-cooks <br/>
list?  that&#39;s an active mailing list, couldn&#39;t keep up with that one <br/>
either before I even got EQ.  SCA is totally too time consuming for me <br/>
right now.  Still got my garb and other stuff around the house but <br/>
haven&#39;t been to fighter practice or an event in over a year.  Hubby had <br/>
his name go through but I haven&#39;t done mine yet, his official name is <br/>
Wolfgang Schwarzvald, my SCA name is the same one I use in EQ--Bebinn <br/>
Maolcataig, Bebinn is the name of Brian Boru&#39;s mother and the surname is <br/>
Mulcahy at around the same time period.  I don&#39;t anticipate any problems <br/>
with getting it to pass when I decide to rejoin the SCA.  BTW what <br/>
kingdom are you in?  I&#39;m in Atlantia, Barony of Bright Hills, in <br/>
probably the only barony that has 2 Barons instead of a Baron and <br/>
Baroness, I keep up on local Barony news, the elected Baron is a good <br/>
friend of mine and his consort is his husband.  I love them both and <br/>
it&#39;s a very stressful job they have.  There was opposition to his <br/>
consort at first because he wasn&#39;t a woman, sheesh, you don&#39;t have to <br/>
have a male/female couple to run the barony.  Just have to have 2 people <br/>
who can keep the barony together up there in the fancy chairs.<br/>
