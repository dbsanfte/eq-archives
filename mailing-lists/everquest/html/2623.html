<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111276484">Actually, spells are a small part of a Rangers damage output.  You <br/>
should be looking for 20-24 delay weapons now and just dual wield <br/>
them to death.  There are several good Ranger sites around that give <br/>
you the low down on playing an effective Ranger.  Most groups want a <br/>
SoW&#39;er and a Snare&#39;er!  I&#39;ll look them up and post one for you.<br/>
<br/>
As for armor, banded is ok, but you should be starting your Ivy <br/>
Etched quests or looking into Ry&#39;Gorr.  Weight is the killer for most <br/>
Rangers and all those armors help.  And get you Short Sword of <br/>
Morin.  You should be able to handle the Ghoul Messenger in WK.  Make <br/>
us proud!<br/>

&gt; Yeah, I am pretty good in groups. That is the thing about rangers I <br/>
dont like is having to pull, but sometimes it is fun. Rangers are the <br/>
best outdoor pullers. At 30 I have found that I can still be a main <br/>
tank. I concentrate soley on AC. Riftwind&#39;s protection is a great <br/>
spell that really helps your AC. I like being a ranger because, they <br/>
are surprisingly effective at helping out in bad situations. Of <br/>
course, the wizard and enchanter are the best at putting down a bad <br/>
situation, but the ranger isn&#39;t that bad either. If you have a full <br/>
bar of mana and a decent wis, you can cast your 37hp nuke like twenty <br/>
times. I guess I am saying that Rangers have some control over how <br/>
much damage they deal, whereas the other tanks just do consistent <br/>
damage. If a ranger wants something to die faster they can do that <br/>
which is helpful in a group and something most people and rangers I <br/>
played with dont realize. I understand that as you get older you have <br/>
to be more aware about not drawing agro. I read a post somewhere that <br/>
says a ranger needs to keep their AC at 20 times their level. I am at <br/>
level 30 and with Riftwinds Protection and the new thornskin buff, my <br/>
AC is exactly 600. I don&#39;t know how I am going to get the money to <br/>
get it any higher. I am still mostly in banded though, so I guess it <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be that hard. I will try to make some friends to play with, <br/>
but I have always had a hard time with that for some reason, maybe I <br/>
should try the friends command.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Group skills are probably the most important thing you can have in <br/>
the game.  As a Ranger you are sometimes asked to pull, and you need <br/>
to know how to do that.  Otherwise you&#39;re a backup to the tank.  The <br/>
roles change several times during the game as you progress in <br/>
levels.  Now I feel how poorly Rangers tank when the Mob puts the <br/>
smack down on me!  Maybe I should change my name to Manasponge! LOL </span></blockquote></div>
