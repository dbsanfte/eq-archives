&gt;I do not suggest they should put level caps on everything, certainly not <br/>
&gt;items made with player skills, or things you can buy in stores.. But more <br/>
&gt;like things like rubicite, mithril eq etc.. And they HAVE put level caps on <br/>
&gt;some eq in a way now.. Since you can&#39;t even go into fear plane below level <br/>
&gt;46 anymore, all that eq is capped at level 46.. AND nodrop.. I just dont <br/>
&gt;want everything to be nodrop so it hinders the trade economy, I want to be <br/>
&gt;able to trade away my old weapon for a new one and a shitload of platina, <br/>
&gt;when I can, instead of just putting the old weapon in the bank to rot away, <br/>
&gt;or destroying it..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Case well stated. Never thought of it that way, nor even thought about those <br/>
items as they are out of my reach. But for a twink, they may not be. And.... <br/>
as in the case stated above, I agree totally. SO I guess you just changed my <br/>
mind for me.</div>
