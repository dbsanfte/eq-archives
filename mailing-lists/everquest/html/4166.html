all.&nbsp; I am picking up a GeForce4 TI 4200 64 mb video card and I was 
wondering how much of a difference that was from a GeForce4 MX440 04 mb video 
card.&nbsp; Will I see much of a difference?&nbsp; I was just wondering about 
that because I remember a while back a discussion about the cards on this board 
before.&nbsp; Well I would apperciate any comments on this topic.&nbsp; 
according to the manufacturer did say theis card did better than thier 128 mb 
version of the same card due to the clock speed of the ram.&nbsp; Just what i 
have heard.</font></div>
