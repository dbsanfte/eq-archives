<b>Subject:</b> Rude  people. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-34470902">We all know that there are rude peeps on EQ.  There is one person <br/>
that almost everyone on the Fennin server knows.  Uncledread.  The <br/>
other night someone petitioned the GM&#39;s on an unrelated issue and <br/>
right after the gm introduced him/her self, he/she asked if the <br/>
petition was about Uncledread.  The person went ahead and said yes.  <br/>
Uncledread&#39;s account is now banned lol.  That will hopefully teach <br/>
him a lesson and change his attitude towards other people.  I guess <br/>
he had so many bad flags on his account that the GM&#39;s decided enough <br/>
is enough.  Why waste our time on this guy if he keeps ignoring our <br/>
warnings.  I&#39;ve only been playing EQ for about 3 months to the day <br/>
and despite the negative aspects, I am addicted hehe.  Not so much <br/>
addicted as to getting mad about having to do RL stuff but addicted <br/>
enough to sometimes say lol in RL speech or to say &quot;group&quot; or &quot;guild&quot; <br/>
verbally before saying something to someone lol.<br/>

The 41st Iksar Necromancer formally known as Necrosars Corpses.<br/>
Now known as Piezie V&#39;rix :(<br/>
(My name was changed without my knowledge because the combination I <br/>
saw as part Necromancer and part Iksar, someone else saw as &#39;NE&#39;(any)<br/>
cro&#39;SARS&#39; &#39;CORPSES&#39;.  I mean come on.  That is just rediculous.  I&#39;m <br/>
still trying to get my name back hehe.  One day, one day.  O btw to <br/>
edumicate the masses, more people die from the Flu each year than <br/>
that stupid SARS thing everyone is so fricken afraid of.  I mean come <br/>
on.  You get more germs on your hands grabbing the door handle of the <br/>
restroom than you do wiping your self with your hand.  A lot good <br/>
washing your hands did before you touched the door handle lol.  Well <br/>
I&#39;ll quit babbleing.   I&#39;m just so bored.  I&#39;m at college and i can&#39;t <br/>
play everquest on the computers there.  I look forward to reading <br/>
more chats :D<br/>
<br/>
Also the 19th Iksar Shaman known as Gloknich.<br/>
