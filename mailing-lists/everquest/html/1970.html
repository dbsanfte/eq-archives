Check your cables/phone lines for kinks or damage. a simple kink or crushed<br/>
point can ruin your connection. Also clean your phone jacks but do not use<br/>
water. :-)<br/>
Sometimes just pulling out the phone line and plugging it back in to the<br/>
jack can help improve the connection.<br/>
I personally went to the trouble of getting special phone cords just for<br/>
modems. They were about $12 for 15 feet of cable. They really helped my<br/>
connection. They are much thicker than normal phone cords. There are also<br/>
some cords that have special coating to sheild them from electrical<br/>
discharge. Oh, magnets can screw up connections too. Anything with<br/>
electrical or magnetic (or both) fields can disrupt internet connections.<br/>
Radios, speakers, and fans are common culprits. Even phones have magnetism.<br/>
That is why you should never ever ever set your phone down on a floppy disk<br/>
unless you want the disk erased.<br/>
Ok, I&#39;ll shut up for real now.<br/>
