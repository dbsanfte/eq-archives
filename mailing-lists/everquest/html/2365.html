that Archery is broken and serves no purpose but to pull albeit from <br/>
great distances.  I was hoping that a well developed archer, along <br/>
with snare could do most damage to mobs before its arrival.  If this <br/>
not true I find it staggering.  Its fine for casters to snare, DD and <br/>
DoT - ie fighting from a distance, but not bow-wielders?  <br/>

bow.  First, the procedure is called bow kiting.  You snare your <br/>
prey, DoT it and run backwards sticking arrows in it until the snare <br/>
breaks.  Then hopefully you&#39;ve done enough damage to finish it off <br/>
with your sword(s).  I still do this, though only with blue&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
And your friend was sorta right.  It&#39;s not bugged so much as it&#39;s not <br/>
very effective.  Arrows cost, even if you make them yourself.  And <br/>
what self-respecting Ranger doesn&#39;t fletch his own bows and arrows?  <br/>
Even with a quiver to speed up your recovery time you really can&#39;t <br/>
stick a lot of arrows into your prey.  I can get them down to about <br/>
60% on a good day.  Now if you can get one of the high damage bows <br/>
early you may have a better time at this.  The Trueshot is attainable <br/>
to low levels, and you may get lucky!<br/>
<br/>
The other problem is running backwards sometimes get&#39;s you into more <br/>
trouble!  Especially if your prey is prone to having like creatures <br/>
join in.  Or Grimfeather comes along!  And Rangers can&#39;t quad kite! <br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;ll find pulling with a bow to be risky in some places.  It&#39;s <br/>
too easy to get a train started.  Not that I&#39;m speaking from prior <br/>
experience here!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I would have liked Rangers to be the preeminent Archery class.  <br/>
We share crits with Warriors, and have a few specials once we hit 50, <br/>
but that&#39;s it.  Yes, we have dual wield, double attack lightning <br/>
swords of death!  Gotta watch that too.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting!<br/>
