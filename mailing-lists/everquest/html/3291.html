 </span></blockquote>See, we don&#39;t keep an armory in my guild. We used to have one but the person<br/>
who had all the stuff either stopped playing or switched to a different<br/>
server so nobody could get the stuff.<br/>
Rather than having an armory, we help other members obtain items if we can.<br/>
We believe that people should earn the items they get and they can either<br/>
buy them off of another member or we help them to obtain it. In some cases<br/>
items are given to members but it all depends on the individual players and<br/>
what they like to do. We don&#39;t like begging and don&#39;t want to encourage it<br/>
in our guild.<br/>
