<div id="ygrps-yiv-363137071">Hi Su and thanks .<br/>
<br/>
I used Macromedia Flash MX Professional 2004  to create the film the music<br/>
addition was just a simple thing of adding it into one of teh frams  and<br/>
letting  it start where I wanted it to.<br/>
<br/>
As for the pics I can thank my guildmates for most of the pics  I just<br/>
arranged them in a way that I thought would work best for what I had in mind<br/>
as I was picking them out  and I tried to have some of the effects to be<br/>
timed  with various parts of the song itself.  One of my guildmates said<br/>
that they liked the part where my Char is on his Drogmor and raises his epic<br/>
to point  at  what I would like to imagine  was a mob we were getting ready<br/>
to attack. In actuality we were getting set up for a Raid in Plane of Sky<br/>
(air) and I had actually targeted the dwarf in front of me  and used him for<br/>
the point reference hehe.<br/>
<br/>
My actual favorite though out of all of that was the very last frame lol<br/>
where you can replay  teh film lol. that is my illustyrious guild leader lol<br/>
and one of our trade skillers suggested that he dye his armor pink for April<br/>
Foll&#39;s and  someone took teh screenshot of him dancing in his pink outfit<br/>
lol  and as soon as I saw it I knew I wanted that one to be at teh end of<br/>
the film. At the time I planned this I hadn&#39;t thought about even doing a<br/>
replay feature till I was nearly done withteh film and it took me a week to<br/>
figure out how to keep the film form ending completely and going back to the<br/>
start of the actual film and not to the prelaod portion. Byt the time I was<br/>
done with the film I think my brain went LD for a couple of days lol just<br/>
before I posted it for public viewing lol<br/>
<br/>
my next favorite is where i am nekkid in PoK waiting for a rezz and one of<br/>
our wizzies was there with me and in the movie I just had to make fun of the<br/>
beggars  that are so prevalent in the Eq world lol<br/>

&gt; Wow! That&#39;s really cool!<br/>
&gt; How do you make a flash program and add music to it?<br/>
&gt; Love that song and the images are great!<br/>
&gt; Wonderful job!!<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I just recently took on a project by my guild.  namely to make a flash<br/>
movie for them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Understand i have never created anything of this nature until now and  it<br/>
took me a month to go from start to &gt;finish.  I would appreciate it if you<br/>
all would go to<br/>
&gt; &gt;http://www.kwasient.com/EQ/LoV/lov.html<br/>
&gt; &gt;and let me know what I could possibly do to improve when I start the next<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks<br/>
