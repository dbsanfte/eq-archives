 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve used a few Velium weapons and found the proc to be slightly <br/>
helpful.  It&#39;s only a 10 point DD.  The main use of them is that they <br/>
are magic, so you can hit those pesky wisps, and they are quick.  You <br/>
can also find Frozen weapons, which have a better ratio then Velium <br/>
in the same type of weapon.<br/>

In all my time playing I have seldom found anything you can get from <br/>
a quest that compares to an item you can buy.  My SSoM was about the <br/>
only useful weapon I&#39;ve gotten, and I just replaced it with a Yak.  <br/>
And yes, &quot;My will is not strong enough to command this weapon&quot;! LOL<br/>
