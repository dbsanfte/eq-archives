  <div><br></div><tt>My machine is maxed for memory at 256. I could not find a 
  gforce 3 <br>with a pci connector. So, the 4mx was the best next choice. I 
  will <br>just bear with the minor hiccups until I am ready to go for a new 
  <br>system. It is really much better than before. Especially after the 
  <br>tnt2 crapped out and I was stuck with my onboard graphics for a few 
  <br>weeks. The present is really quite good, comparatively.<br><br>With the 
  benefit of hindsight, I would have gone for a more robust <br>system in spite 
  of financial constraints, but the one I bought seemed <br>to be a sound 
  mid-level machine at the time.<br><br>How good does a system have to be to 
  survive for any time in the ever <br>advancing world of EQ? Better than I 
  thought last year, that is for <br>sure.<br><br>There is the hope that S&amp;V 
  will continue to patch with retro-<br>compatibility in mind. I know that they 
  won&#39;t make that a primary <br>purpose, but the market might not bear a 
  constant demand for users to <br>upgrade. They appear to know and respond to 
  the market, and should <br>have some idea just how much the gaming public will 
  pay to play.<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br>--- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Louis

  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally got my card. Got it installed and went for a test 
  drive.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; One area that is a big problem is 
  Rivervale. With the last <br>expansion <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rivervale became 
  so laggy that I avoided going home when I could. <br>Now <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  I get a few hiccups when I enter the zone, then it settles down <br>to a 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; playable level. A hitch now and then, but nothing like 
  before the <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; upgrade.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked 
  out a few cities, some zones in between. Made technical <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  adjustments. On the whole quite pleased.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; One 
  thing I noticed was a bit of lag in laggy zones (Luclin was 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; almost unplayable until now)until I had been there a bit. 
  When I <br>went <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Bazaar I just did a slow 360 and 
  the lag went away. Figure <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; enough of the zone loaded into 
  active memory to carry the play <br>from <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; then on. Perhaps 
  someone could explain what was actuall happening <br>to <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  the system when I do this. Anyway, I do a scan of my environment <br>when 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I zone and things are pretty smooth.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my last upgrade to my present system. Have to 
  replace my <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; tower next, and hope to hold out a while. How 
  much can I spend <br>every <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; year on these things? The 
  family expects me to feed them, and I <br>hate <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 
  dissppoint them too often on that account just to play my game.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if DSL comes down a bit in price, I may try that. 
  Could that <br>be <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; the key to absolute 
  smooth-as-butter-on-a-bald-monkey performance <br>on <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; my 
  aging machine? (The thing is just a bit over a year old. How <br>fast 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; they grow old.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barto
