 </span></blockquote>You actually buy a whip that summons the horse. The whips are named for<br/>
color of horse, and apparently for speed, but the names didn&#39;t make sense<br/>
to me. They&#39;re sold by a normal merchant, and boy, do you REALLY see how<br/>
faction/charisma changes the price!</div>
