 </span></blockquote>I am still downloading those 2 files at your site, or at least <br/>
attempt to..<br/>
<br/>
It seems like there is a limiter there, as sometimes it stops me at <br/>
200k, the other day I got 600k and it says finished downloading in <br/>
d/l express.. sigh<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to sound like im grumbling, but it aint right, buying ALL the <br/>
expansions (yep, I just bought Trilogy, Evolution, Velious, Luclin, <br/>
PoP, LDoN and GoD) and installed ALL of them just to be sure that I <br/>
do NOT have to patch much.. yet, after all those FULL installation <br/>
that come up to 2.7gig.. I still need to download a 76mb patch, well <br/>
150mb if you count the legends, optional zones, languages packs and <br/>
if you click on the various zones shown on the advanced tab of the <br/>
patch menu.<br/>
<br/>
It just aint right, to dowload a 76mb patch, so that you can even log <br/>
on, when GoD just came out.. and still saying EQ is playable by dial-<br/>
up. I am not cursing Verant here, as I am a TRUE believer in EQ, just <br/>
saying it aint fair, see?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know you had to keep up with tech or you will lose out and <br/>
nobody even care.. sigh I remember when Voodo3k and GeForce Ti 4400 <br/>
ruled the world! hehe friends kept saying I wasted buying such an <br/>
expensive voodoo on EQ!<br/>
<br/>
Few hours later, I will be able to log into Norrath, as I took the <br/>
effort to visit a cable company and pid them to dowload the patch and <br/>
copy it to a cd so that I can transfer those to my pc. Rest assured <br/>
that the cost and time wasted alone has already exceed the sum value <br/>
of all those expansions boxes I purchased, oops I forgot the EQ Atlas <br/>
and Prima hint books I also grabbed.<br/>
<br/>
Serve me right for being such loyal to EQ when I already left for 3 <br/>
years.. I was intrigued by this 5th Anni trial offer to come back for <br/>
a month.. and bought all the boxes, checked websites and found the 12-<br/>
mth sub offer (WOW a bargain, and directly paid without knowing I <br/>
cant even log in yet).. I just hope I can re-learn my skills back <br/>
when im in game.. when I had lost my manastone and heard that it cost <br/>
100-300k nowadays, no matter what folks says.. manastone really is <br/>
great for a cleric and wiz, heck in fact for all caster class.</div>
