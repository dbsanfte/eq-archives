<div id="ygrps-yiv-120429028"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That would explain why I was repeatedly disconnected last night. It was<br/>
&gt; getting extremely annoying. It didn&#39;t even occur to me that not only were<br/>
&gt; the servers unstable after the new expansion, but that there were probably<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; million people playing with their new Froglok characters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I kept getting kicked too. There were over 200 people in the plane of<br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Speaking of Frogloks, I have seen many that were already in their 20s, and<br/>
&gt; it was the first day. I can only imagine how long those people have been<br/>
&gt; playing yesterday... probably hours and hours on end. It&#39;s amazing that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; don&#39;t have anything to do on a Monday of all days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Before I went to bed there was a lvl 36 froggy on Monday.<br/>
Someone was asking ooc how that was possible. My answer: DSL and high lvl<br/>
friends to PL.<br/>
Of which I have neither. :-(<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I do not have the expansion yet. I might have mentioned this, but I am<br/>
&gt; unfortunately using dial up, and the download would have taken more than 6<br/>
&gt; hours. Therefore, I am waiting until the expansion hits stores in a week<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so and purchasing it that way. I can&#39;t wait to use the new features, such<br/>

 </span></blockquote>much<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; easier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it took me for freaking ever to dl all those files. 19.2kbps<br/>
connection sucks ass. And it goes lower when it rains...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; On another note, does anyone know anything about the new creatures that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; may purchase for riding, such as a horse? Are they more expensive than<br/>
&gt; horses? I have wanted a horse for the longest time, but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; tough to make money... especially being a caster. When grouped, the melee<br/>
&gt; types loot the corpses before I can get to them usually.<br/>
