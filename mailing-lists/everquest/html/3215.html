<b>Subject:</b> refamiliarizing myself <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983214786">After taking a long break from Evercrack at the Betty Ford Clinic I&#39;m<br/>
back. I actually did forgat a few things and want to refamiliarize<br/>
myself, On the 3 bars that tell you your health and level status, I<br/>
forgot what the blue line is for. I know it has something to do with<br/>
your charma or something like that. <br/>
<br/>
Also I just started playing with a Necro just to see what it&#39;s like. Any<br/>
good suggestion for getting Necro stuff? BTW I&#39;m a Gnome. <br/>
<br/>
What are the elements a Magician needs to conjure up a elementa pet like<br/>
fire or earth? I ran out and now I can&#39;t remember what I need to get!<br/>
What a dummy!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
