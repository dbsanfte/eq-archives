<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082710929">I play on a laptop: P4 1.19GHz, 512MB RAM, GeoForce2Go video card, <br/>
Windows XP. I have a TERRIBLE lag in Bazaar, and sometimes in PoK. <br/>
You guys think I should upgrade my video card? I know Sony doesn&#39;t <br/>
support playing on a laptop, but aside from the lag in those two <br/>
areas, it&#39;s working quite well.<br/>

technically run a version of EQ on it, but I was more curious as to <br/>
everyone&#39;s computers.<br/>

set of Creative  FPS2000 4 point surround sound speakers, and a 19&quot; <br/>
flat screen Samsung monitor.  Great sound and great graphics, but <br/>
lags a little on Luclin and the newer zones. <br/>

being.  It does do digital audio out, but I only have a set of old <br/>
Labtec speakers.  Also, the monitor is a 17&quot; Gateway E200 monitor.  <br/>

changes to the P4.  I plan on putting it up to a full gig and a half <br/>
of RAM and upgrading to a 128MB video card and a SoundBlaster Audigy <br/>
card.  So when I get the money as they say...  :)  Hopefully next <br/>
month!<br/>
