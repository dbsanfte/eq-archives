<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028917144">Hello All<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m about 20 years late, but I&#39;m making that transition from <br/>
Ultima Online and MUD to EQ.  I&#39;ve been enjoying it so far on the <br/>
Tribunal Server. THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE! Leveling is pretty balance. <br/>
Plenty of helpful players!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just looking for advice on how to get more money.  A player gave <br/>
me a sweet sword does high damage, but other than that I&#39;m naked. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
DLG</div>
