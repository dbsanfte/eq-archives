depends on the race. If not then i would suggest, LOIO, The oasis, <br/>
and high hold pass, and if your lucky you can get into a high hold <br/>
keep grp, it all depends, also if you good, you can solo in those <br/>
areas except, high hold keep. There is also a place where mud people <br/>
live, but i cant remember where, that has good exp, plus all the <br/>
clay you can hold.</div>
