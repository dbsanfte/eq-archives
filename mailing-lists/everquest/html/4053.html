<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It&#39;s merely a coincidence albeit ironic that the 
show is called &quot;Call For Help&quot;.&nbsp; However, it is not what you surmise it to 
be.&nbsp; It is a computer help show.&nbsp; They introduce new technologies and 
give you tips and hints on how to use Windows, Macs, and virtually every other 
computer oriented device.&nbsp; It&#39;s a wonderful show that explains technology 
in very simple language.&nbsp; However, it does strike me as odd that Call For 
Help would want to do the bit on Everquest, because it does sound more up the 
alley of The Screen Savers, another computer oriented show.&nbsp; Both Call For 
Help and The Screen Savers (although not so much recently) are (were) hosted by 
a man named Leo Laporte&nbsp; (<a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.leoville.com">www.leoville.com</a>).&nbsp; Leo also does a tech 
talk show on California radio and has numerous books out.&nbsp; He&#39;s a big brain 
and an amazingly funny guy.&nbsp; I used to watch TechTV when it was originally 
ZDTV.&nbsp; And I still watch it on the occasional basis when I have the time 
and when I&#39;m not in EQ.&nbsp; I&#39;d suggest checking out TechTV&#39;s website.&nbsp; 
It will give you links to every show and you can find out for yourself what kind 
of show Call For Help is.&nbsp; </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>I have to admit that I raised an eyebrow after reading that 
  the show that <br>wants to interview an EverQuest addict is called &#39;Call for 
  Help.&#39; I think if <br>it was a different type of show, no one would have 
  bashed it, but obviously <br>the only point they want an addict on it is so 
  they can bash US. I have to <br>say, nice try, but no one wants to be put 
  through that. We like EverQuest... <br>deal with it.<br><br><br><br>Love
