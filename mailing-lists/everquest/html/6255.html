<div id="ygrps-yiv-529566313">Most spells over 50 can be bought in POK in the<br/>
library.  However, there are also quests with the mob<br/>
listed below that you need to get a dropped spell and<br/>
turn them in to this NPC.  In return she/he will give<br/>
you a new spell totally random back.  It also appears<br/>
that a lot of your spells are dropped over 50<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to do is type<br/>
/who enchanter 50 60 all<br/>
This will return the list of chanters online in that<br/>
level range.  Send one a tell asking about spells I am<br/>
sure someone will help you out.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the NPC is in Firiona Vie<br/>
Gracie F&#39;Liler is actually at<br/>
-3495,3059<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
