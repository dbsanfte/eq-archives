<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638847186">Ok here is the difference with me and my friend&#39;s.<br/>
I have a Geoforce2 with 32MB ram his is the intel<br/>
system board 32 MB .<br/>
<br/>
Mine actually runs ok but I need to use 800 x 600, no<br/>
luclin images, meaning people stuff, and some other<br/>
minor tweaks.<br/>
<br/>
If I use the old UI it runs smoother.<br/>
But the 32MB card in mine seems ok or do you think a<br/>
better card will REALLY help.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; At the present <br/>
&gt; prices you could probably get a gforce 3 plus up<br/>
&gt; your memory to 512 <br/>
&gt; for around $200. It would be a good move. I have<br/>
&gt; even seen gforce 4ti <br/>
&gt; for around $175. Hopefully you have agp slots. I<br/>
&gt; have only pci, so I <br/>
&gt; cannot do as I have recommended for you. sigh.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just bought a new machine and have a question. <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had some Mouse issues but I solved those but now I<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; a little skip in the movement when I run or walk. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It is like frame by frame.  The machine is a 1.2<br/>
&gt; GHZ<br/>
&gt; &gt; machine with 384 Ram and 32 MB video card.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now, my question is, &quot;Does the video card with EQ<br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt; the difference or is it RAM?&quot;  The reason I ask is<br/>
&gt; &gt; because when you choose the Luclin images it tells<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; how many to pick based on Ram and not Video<br/>
&gt; memory.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So does EQ use RAM more so than Video ram or not?<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t mind getting a 64 MB video card but I want<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; to work.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My friend also sees the same issues but only has<br/>
&gt; 256<br/>
&gt; &gt; mb ram<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>
