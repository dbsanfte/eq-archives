<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011079292">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
This may sound like a newbie question, but that&#39;s probably because I&#39;m a<br/>
newbie. First question, is, no matter how hard I try, I can NEVER run away<br/>
form anything. I jump while I run. I have tried strafing to the side while I<br/>
run. I just can&#39;t seem to do it. Also, I have seen a rat named &quot;Scruffy&quot;<br/>
several times. Does this thing serve any purpose besides an extra rat?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
