<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761857544"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m a number 9 magician and was wondering how you use Practice<br/>
&gt; Research.  I&#39;ve made the practice ruins in my Elemental Grimoire, but<br/>
&gt; not sure what to do with them or any other ruin that I create in the<br/>
&gt; future.  If they do something special, I&#39;d like to know..HELP!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you don&#39;t use the &quot;Elemental Grimoire&quot;, but instead the &quot;Concordance<br/>
of Research&quot;. check the links below to learn how to obtain those.<br/>
<br/>
also i think you won&#39;t be able to increase research until you hit 16.<br/>
the first level where you can spent one training point in it. so any<br/>
components you use are just burned.<br/>
<br/>
on my webspace i have a copy of the &quot;Everquest Magician Resource&quot;.<br/>
it is the old unmodified version of the origianal pages. there you will find<br/>
all you need about (mage and) practice research:<br/>

practice research is at<br/>

<br/>
if you want to do research only for your (mage-)spells, it is better to<br/>
wait! besides: level 34 to 44 &quot;research only&quot; spells were added on<br/>
some vendors, when Luclin was introduced (this also includes wizzy<br/>
and chanter spells).<br/>
<br/>
there is no such &quot;feature&quot; for necro spells, but i did the following thing<br/>
with my necro, and i also recommend this to the other pure casters as<br/>
well: wait till you get to level 30. some research only spells aren&#39;t really<br/>
needed to get to that level (a necro can survive pretty good without a<br/>
pet at those levels). then train your research as high as possible (i think<br/>
PP will be the limit for non-alt chars).<br/>
<br/>
also don&#39;t forget about bazaar! many research only spells or components<br/>
are sold there ... but check/compare the prices.<br/>
<br/>
one more thing about research components: i &quot;scan&quot; merchants in popular<br/>
zones from time to time. for example, it takes about one hour to check<br/>
ALL merchants in PoK, but it is worth it: either you can sell the components<br/>
or the spells for quite some good money (10 spells for 400pp each; takes<br/>
about 3 to 4 days to sell them all on a vendor in bazaar).<br/>
<br/>
i hope this helps a bit... good luck<br/>
