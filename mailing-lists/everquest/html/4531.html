<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-183229678">Thanks for the info.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft says it is full compatible with DirectX 8.x, and even <br/>
suggests upgrading for multi-player and online games. Maybe the EQ <br/>
developers just haven&#39;t had a chance to test and approve it yet?<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately it cannot be uninstalled anyway according to the <br/>
Microsoft FAQ:<br/>

<br/>
The biggest problem we have right now is that when zoning, after <br/>
waiting 5 minutes, it crashes back to the server screen more often <br/>
than not.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
