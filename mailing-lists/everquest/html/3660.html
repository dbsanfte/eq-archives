<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406729850">I will say one thing......the Eqatlas.com&#39;s Luclin<br/>
maps are ok but since Lucline has been out for a<br/>
while, I would personally like to see some dangers and<br/>
benefits which I think are lacking big time currently.<br/>
<br/>
There also needs to be updates to the existing maps...<br/>
For example we raided Runnyeye the other day and a<br/>
monk was looking for a quest item from floor 4.  I was<br/>
on floor two with another friend and it dropped off of<br/>
something not even stated..... which is fine but it<br/>
was not expected at all, updates like this would be<br/>
great.<br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents<br/>

&gt; map that they update off the other maps they have.<br/>
&gt; Two, No cartoony<br/>
&gt; maps. It makes things a little too confusing; And<br/>
&gt; three, Add a legend to<br/>
&gt; the maps and include a N S E W compass. I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; saying they suck, just<br/>
&gt; would like to see some improvements. Hopefully<br/>
&gt; Verant&#39;s will be more<br/>
&gt; consistent. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the dual monitor, It&#39;s easy, just have a<br/>
&gt; second video card<br/>
&gt; installed and run EQ on one and your other info on<br/>
&gt; the other. You may<br/>
&gt; have to tweak the settings a little but that<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t be hard to do.<br/>
&gt; The monitors can be mapped to do this. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will probably buy the forthcoming atlas, once it<br/>
&gt; is out. It will be <br/>
&gt; cheaper than printing up the rest of the maps I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have, since I <br/>
&gt; have been only printing maps as I need them. Plus,<br/>
&gt; we ran out of ink <br/>
&gt; and nobody in my household wants to be the one to<br/>
&gt; spring for the new <br/>
&gt; ink. Probably because they know a large number of<br/>
&gt; maps will be <br/>
&gt; printed as soon as the ink is loaded. ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I would really like is to have eq in a window,<br/>
&gt; with a second <br/>
&gt; monitor to hold my data; maps, charts, lists, and<br/>
&gt; recipes. I know <br/>
&gt; there is a hack to allow this, but I would prefer a<br/>
&gt; sanctioned <br/>
&gt; window. Plus I don&#39;t have the horsepower on this<br/>
&gt; system to carry such <br/>
&gt; a load. My game would suffer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Twenty bucks for the atlas sounds cheaper all round.<br/>
