<div id="ygrps-yiv-838750360">WOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
After a long long long time of working on my skills, farming the items, and<br/>
spending almost all of my money... I finally did it!<br/>
I failed a combine a couple times and lost two runed sea shells (which were<br/>
the most expensive thing I had to buy for it-- I tried hunting in SG but<br/>
didn&#39;t have any luck). I got my JC to 173, my tailoring to 176, fletching to<br/>
180, brewing to 184, pottery to 154, and smithing to 112. I got impatient on<br/>
the pottery and just asked someone to put the water and the velium powder<br/>
(made from the runed sea shell and a small brick of velium in a mortar and<br/>
pestle-- no fail combine) in a pottery wheel and got my Unfired Rune. I<br/>
fired the rune. I bought a geerlok gemsetter. Borrowed a geerlok planing<br/>
tool for my fletching for the combines. and borrowed a geerlok sewing kit<br/>
for the final combine. Had C3 on and success!!<br/>
I now have my Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl!<br/>
Now I need to work on JC and Smithing some more for my 8th shawl...<br/>
luv,<br/>
