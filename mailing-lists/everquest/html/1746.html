hehe that&#39;s always fun to do...my wizzie (23) stopped an entire Swarm in NK<br/>
with a couple of AOE&#39;s...the kiddies sure loved that...or Thyla&#39;s trick of<br/>
completely clearing the Gnoll camp at Rathe, the entire Aviak city, Paw back<br/>
to the doors, or CB&#39;s throne room for them to get corpses.<br/>

  Speaking of fun, my brother (lvl 27 Paladin), my guildmate (lvl 20 warr)<br/>
and<br/>
  myself (lvl 29 cleric) owned Crushbone yesterday. We went in and killed<br/>
  every single orc just for fun. There was nobody else there so we owned the<br/>
  place. It was great!<br/>
  luv,<br/>

  &gt; I have managed to get my ranger 14 levels without getting killed and<br/>
  &gt; my druid all the way from 1 to 21 before getting snuffed.<br/>

  &gt; My rogue on the other hand... oi!<br/>
