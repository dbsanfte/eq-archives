<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Are slow horses worth getting? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-266736128">When I still played, I had a cheap horse for my cleric.  They are good <br/>
for &quot;medding while standing&quot; so you can get that heal off quicker.  But <br/>
I rarely rode the horse.  I just sat on it while fighting.  If we moved <br/>
our camp spot, I got off the horse, because SoW and SoE were faster.<br/>

&gt;on my friend&#39;s account he has a cheap drog and then i found out the <br/>
&gt;cheap ones are slow =P lol. Are the horses the same? All the things <br/>
&gt;the cheap ones do is make you look rich.<br/>
