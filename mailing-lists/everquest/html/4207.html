<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992559817"><p>I think you&#39;d be fine coming back now. Apparently quite a few ppl got this game for Christmas because I&#39;ve been seeing lots of &quot;true newbies&quot; for the first time in a long time. Also, I got a RL friend of mine playing just last week. You could group with her, hehe. 
<p>A lot has changed in the game, I think you&#39;d like it. Lower lvls are much easier to get through now.

Question is, being that EQ has been out for 5 <br>years, is it too late to come back and start anew?

How is Camelot? Or Neverwinter Nights?<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Yager<br><br></tt><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com/">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
