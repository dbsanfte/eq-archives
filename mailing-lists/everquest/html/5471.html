<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464012569">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Peg, and I am glad to have found your e-loop.  I&#39;m one<br/>
of those newbies.  Started about three weeks ago, role playing as<br/>
Qaidyanye, (still a 1st level High Elf-Paly) on the Brell Serilis<br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
Hey there Peg,<br/>
That mail quest you found is a quick way to get some money in the game, its<br/>
not much, but every gold helps when your just starting out.  You should have<br/>
recieved a letter when you told him you would deliever the mail, but if it<br/>
had vanished then my question would be did you put it in your inventory or<br/>
did you forget and had it in hand (on the cursor) when you got to the ZL<br/>
(zoneline) from Felwithe to GFay (Greater Faydark.)  If so then thats where<br/>
you lost it as things you have not put in the inventory tend to vanish after<br/>
zoning (going from one zone to another.)  That book thing you clicked on was<br/>
a portal to the Planes of Knowledge, a zone where the people who reside<br/>
there gather knowledge and focus on learning.  Its also an area where lots<br/>
of people gather to get information, buffs (spells cast on them that greatly<br/>
improve their fighting and survival abilities,) and do some selling or<br/>
buying.  Once you enter the Plane of Knowledge (often referred to as PoK)<br/>
you should be facing the port stone that leads back where you cam from.<br/>
Often the name of the town nearest the stone is written on it.  As there are<br/>
usually around 100+ (on Saryn at least) people in this zone the talking can<br/>
be fast so you need to be fast at reading, as for the abbreviations, that<br/>
takes a while to get used to them all.  As for backpacks to open them you<br/>
right-click on them once to open them, easy enough.  If you had no room for<br/>
the items then they fell to the ground and you&#39;d have to pick them up before<br/>
anyone else does.  I&#39;ve seen people lose items to a nearby guard whe grabbed<br/>
it when it dropped.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that all i can say is keep playing and try to watch what goes on<br/>
around you, lots of people will be glad to help you understand these things<br/>
and welcome to EQ(Everquest.)</div>
