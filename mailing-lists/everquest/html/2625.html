<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yeah I am finding that out. I&#39;ve got pretty crappy 
8 28 and 11&nbsp;29 delay weapons and I can still do a lot of damage just by 
fighting. I still think that the damage spells are useful for bringing 
something&nbsp;down faster when&nbsp;a lot of mobs show up, the ranger&nbsp;can 
help take a spellcaster&nbsp;down really fast when they want to. I have been 
finding that lately I just use my mana for snares and buffs.&nbsp;I guess at 
level 49 you get a 200hp nuke that has a long recast time, at 59 you get a 450hp 
nuke with a&nbsp;long recast time. It is obvious that rangers&nbsp;werent 
designed to chain nuke, they even gave us spells that would discourage us from 
doing&nbsp;that, and just wade in with our weapons, and nuke&nbsp;when something 
needs to die a little faster. The wizard of course is the&nbsp;best character at 
bringing mobs down&nbsp;immediately. </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Actually, spells are a small part of a Rangers damage 
  output.&nbsp; You <br>should be looking for 20-24 delay weapons now and just 
  dual wield <br>them to death.&nbsp; There are several good Ranger sites around 
  that give <br>you the low down on playing an effective Ranger.&nbsp; Most 
  groups want a <br>SoW&#39;er and a Snare&#39;er!&nbsp; I&#39;ll look them up and post one 
  for you.<br><br>As for armor, banded is ok, but you should be starting your 
  Ivy <br>Etched quests or looking into Ry&#39;Gorr.&nbsp; Weight is the killer for 
  most <br>Rangers and all those armors help.&nbsp; And get you Short Sword of 
  <br>Morin.&nbsp; You should be able to handle the Ghoul Messenger in WK.&nbsp;

  the thing about rangers I <br>dont like is having to pull, but sometimes it is 
  fun. Rangers are the <br>best outdoor pullers. At 30 I have found that I can 
  still be a main <br>tank. I concentrate soley on AC. Riftwind&#39;s protection is 
  a great <br>spell that really helps your AC. I like being a ranger because, 
  they <br>are surprisingly effective at helping out in bad situations. Of 
  <br>course, the wizard and enchanter are the best at putting down a bad 
  <br>situation, but the ranger isn&#39;t that bad either. If you have a full 
  <br>bar of mana and a decent wis, you can cast your 37hp nuke like twenty 
  <br>times. I guess I am saying that Rangers have some control over how 
  <br>much damage they deal, whereas the other tanks just do consistent 
  <br>damage. If a ranger wants something to die faster they can do that 
  <br>which is helpful in a group and something most people and rangers I 
  <br>played with dont realize. I understand that as you get older you have 
  <br>to be more aware about not drawing agro. I read a post somewhere that 
  <br>says a ranger needs to keep their AC at 20 times their level. I am at 
  <br>level 30 and with Riftwinds Protection and the new thornskin buff, my 
  <br>AC is exactly 600. I don&#39;t know how I am going to get the money to <br>get 
  it any higher. I am still mostly in banded though, so I guess it <br>shouldn&#39;t 
  be that hard. I will try to make some friends to play with, <br>but I have 
  always had a hard time with that for some reason, maybe I <br>should try the 
  friends command.&nbsp; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Group skills are probably the most 
  important thing you can have in <br>the game.&nbsp; As a Ranger you are 
  sometimes asked to pull, and you need <br>to know how to do that.&nbsp; 
  Otherwise you&#39;re a backup to the tank.&nbsp; The <br>roles change several 
  times during the game as you progress in <br>levels.&nbsp; Now I feel how 
  poorly Rangers tank when the Mob puts the <br>smack down on me!&nbsp; Maybe I 
  should change my name to Manasponge! LOL<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
