<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008888193">I was going to pick someone up for a free port and bc I ported to the area<br/>
to get him, I got some paying customers as well. and I was wanting to get<br/>
rid of a robe that I found an upgrade for. Before I could port away someone<br/>
advertised they were looking for a robe. I told him the stats and he offered<br/>
a price. I lowered the price slightly so he could have some money left over.<br/>
But I still made a good profit. :-)<br/>
Oh, I also got to sell a weapon that I&#39;d picked up for a good amount of<br/>
coin.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; One particular experience comes to mind. A lvl 14 wood elf needed to<br/>
&gt; get back home, but was short on cash. I had just ported into the area<br/>
&gt; where he approached me. Just before that I had gotten a very nice<br/>
&gt; reward for a few minutes of tracking. I gave the guy a free ride<br/>
&gt; home. When I arrived in BB I got a tell from someone offering 100pp<br/>
&gt; for a ride. I took the job. A job I would not have gotten had I not<br/>
&gt; felt generous after someone else had been generous to me. Sure, I<br/>
&gt; sometimes get stiffed and sometimes get something I can&#39;t use as a<br/>
&gt; tip, but for the most part I think I have been well rewarded. For me<br/>
&gt; it is in character and adds to the game.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I considered it myself... :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Now that I can port, I have decided to do so without<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;thought of reward. Oh, of course I will go quite a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;bit out of my way for an offer of good money, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have found giving a port to someone unable to give<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;much in return seems to add to the game in other ways<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;than money.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m still pondering exactly how I feel about group<br/>
&gt; &gt; ports. I don&#39;t think I could ever feel right about<br/>
&gt; &gt; running around auctioning &quot;Porting to NK, BB, SF, Tox<br/>
&gt; &gt; and WC for 50pp per seat&quot;, but I do personally think<br/>
&gt; &gt; that a small donation is the right thing when<br/>
&gt; &gt; recieving a port. (not that i&#39;d ever actively demand<br/>
&gt; &gt; one) As someone who&#39;s probably spent a couple hundred<br/>
&gt; &gt; plat on ports over the last while, I just see the<br/>
&gt; &gt; standard 10pp donation is a small way of saying<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;thanks for your time&quot;. Again, not required, but a<br/>
&gt; &gt; nice gesture. It&#39;s most certainly a larger commitment<br/>
&gt; &gt; than SoW... (I still can&#39;t feel right about taking<br/>
&gt; &gt; donations for a SoW though, the guy with the HQ Bear<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pelt was rather persistant, but I usually stubbornly<br/>
&gt; &gt; refuse &#39;em :)<br/>
