  <div><br></div><tt>Yeah the LD monster nearly got me killed last night on the 
  Saryrn Server<br>when I was playing my newly leveled shaman in EW hunting the 
  uthork.<br>Couldn&#39;t have come at a worse time I was OOM, LoHP (maybe had&nbsp; 
  5% hp),&nbsp; all<br>my buffs were gone&nbsp; (KEI included), pet was dead, 
  and SoW was going. and I<br>had 3 Uthorks decide they wanted to break Enstill 
  all at the same time .&nbsp; Oh<br>and I was soloing it.&nbsp; Seeing as this 
  was my first time in EW&nbsp; and I was a<br>newly leveled 38 Shammy I was 
  rather quite pleased with myself that I<br>managed to hold my own against 4 
  Uthorks by myself&nbsp; (well with help from my<br>faithful walking dot 
  Xebaner) once and figured I could do it again. Well<br>that was when&nbsp; 
  everything went wrong when the conditions I stated above<br>started to 
  occur.&nbsp; I had almost killed one of the uthorks when the other 
  3<br>decided to break Enstill&nbsp; and I tried holding my own.&nbsp; Forgot I 
  was OOM and<br>had no more KEI and tried to cast Enstill on the mobs (can we 
  say panic?)<br>Finally I gave it up and ran when 2 of the uthorks decided that 
  my pet<br>wasn&#39;t worth their time and joined their buddy in chasing me leaving 
  my pet<br>to deal with an healthy Uthork. now turning to run probably was my 
  worst<br>mistake when I saw those other 2 coming cause I got stunned and 
  started to<br>spin. when I stopped spinning I began to run and realized I had 
  no idea<br>where the heck I was&nbsp; Keep in mind I am new to the zone had 
  come in earlier<br>with a guildy who took me directly to the Uthorks without 
  giving me a tour<br>of the site and logged after we had killed 2 or 3 
  uthorks.&nbsp; SO I got lost<br>and was&nbsp; somewhere I have no Idea where 
  in EW when I noticed that I was<br>getting no keyboard response.&nbsp; that&#39;s 
  when&nbsp; looked at the connection<br>indicator and saw that it was&nbsp; a 
  very broken yellow line that immediately<br>went to red and then&nbsp; I get 
  the &quot;You have been disconnected&quot; message and I<br>knew I was a dead lvl 38 
  Shaman who would most likely be a Naked lvl 37<br>Barbarian Shaman standing 
  near the Waterfall in GD when I logged back on.<br>When I logged back on I 
  discovered I was on the bridge that goes to IC. And<br>I WAS ALIVE With Sow 
  still Blinking at me, still OOM, and 20 hp left on me<br>AND STILL LEVEL

  seems people have been having trouble everywhere.&nbsp; My guild Hosted 
  a<br>Kael raid last night &amp; we had to call it when the LD monster kept 
  rearing<br>it&#39;s ugly head.&nbsp; it seems from what others were saying is 
  people were<br>dropping like flies all over the server last night.&nbsp; 
  (going LD).&nbsp; hopefully<br>this problem will resolve itself =/.<br>&gt;
