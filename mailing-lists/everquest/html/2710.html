&gt; I just hit level 30 last night, and being the Druid that I am, I had a<br/>
&gt; couple of questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First, I&#39;ve been hunting in South Karana since level 25, hunting the Tesch<br/>
&gt; Mas Gnolls around Paw, and perhaps have become a little spoiled, as I have<br/>
&gt; been getting great experience killing the yellows and whites, and reaping<br/>
&gt; the rewards of the loot. Now, having reached level 30, all of the gnolls<br/>
 </span></blockquote>are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; now nearing the point where hunting them isn&#39;t beneficial. Could someone<br/>
&gt; suggest a similar zone/area with good experience and average to good loot<br/>
&gt; where I could hunt fairly safely, either in a group or solo?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can try going inside Paw (I was actually hunting in Paw from 25 to about<br/>
30, altough you can hunt in Paw longer than that).<br/>
<br/>
After that, I went to RM to hunt HGs and spent some time in Crystal Caverns.<br/>
I basically did 30-40 in RM, CC, OT and Eastern Wastes (with a couple<br/>
unsuccessful trips to Tower of the Frozen Shadow).<br/>
<br/>
I would make sure that you get as much experience dungeons as you can<br/>
though.  LGuk and SolB (along with CC) are good places to try to find a<br/>
group.  I did some hunting in SolA at 30, but you really need to go deep to<br/>
get good XP there.<br/>
