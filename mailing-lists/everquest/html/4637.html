<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094497407">No, don&#39;t get in close enough to melee. They hit pretty hard. Solo,<br/>
rootbombing is one way to get the job done, with the pet helping. With KEI<br/>
it doens&#39;t matter as much that the tactic isn&#39;t as efficient for you as for<br/>
a shaman, wizard, or druid...you have mana to blow. Plus it lets you build<br/>
skills some chanters don&#39;t build much.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hi. My pet and I have been killing Greater Scalebones and Greater<br/>
&gt; Skeletons in Kurn&#39;s Tower. Started there 2 days ago at level 14, and<br/>
&gt; am now a couple small bubbles from 18. I have been donating for a KEI<br/>
&gt; buff in PoK before I go there, and in turn have been casting Breeze,<br/>
&gt; Mist, Strength, Rune I, Quickness, and Intellectual Advancement<br/>
&gt; spells on other players in Kurn&#39;s to try and help them out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been buffing my pet with Mist, Strength, Quickness, Rune I,<br/>
&gt; and myself with those buffs plus Intellectual Advancement and<br/>
&gt; Shielding. I use Root when there is only one target around, and Mez<br/>
&gt; on a target when there are others in the area. Then I hit them with<br/>
&gt; Chaotic Feedback and Choke, alternating until the target breaks the<br/>
&gt; Mez/Root and then my pet finishes it off. I read somewhere that this<br/>
&gt; is called &quot;Root and Nuke&quot; and that it isn&#39;t very effective. I am<br/>
&gt; wondering if there are other ways I should be going about trying to<br/>
&gt; fight as opposed to this? Should I be using my dagger in combination<br/>
&gt; to the rooting/nuking? Any feedback would be great. Thanks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
