<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057715048">*chuckles* You would certainly be considered twinked 3 or 4 months ago but I <br/>
doubt it now. When I was at lvl 25, I was still wearing my much cherished <br/>
Senior Apprentice Robe until my friend saw me in such rags and decided to <br/>
camp an FBR for me. *grins* No, you are not twinked unless if you play in the <br/>
Lanys T&#39;Vyl server. (;  But then again, that&#39;s just my perspective. <br/>
