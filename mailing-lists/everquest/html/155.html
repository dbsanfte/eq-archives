<div id="ygrps-yiv-544662266">You just have to face it.. everybody wants everything today. Its just a<br/>
representation of soceity and the culture we live in.  I myself look at them<br/>
sometimes when i feel im stuck.  The problem is though is.. during the game<br/>
people /ooc or /shout out for solutions and people are so quick to give them<br/>
the answer to any question. Unfortutely the answer is right there i cant<br/>
block it out I can remove it from my mind.  I just wish that people would<br/>
try to keep some mystery to the game, and i know i can just filter out<br/>
Shouts and Out of Characters but... i shouldnt have to do that to enjoy the<br/>
game.  Everyone just wants a hand out.. :)<br/>

this is pretty lame... this is an RPG, but on all the polls, people want<br/>
walkthroughs on quests? where is the fun in that? maybe a hint or 2, but its<br/>
no fun walking around following a guide telling you to avoid so and so<br/>
whatever to not get killed.<br/>
just wondering if anyone aggrees with this...<br/>
