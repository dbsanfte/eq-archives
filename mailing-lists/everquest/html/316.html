 I previously wrote that I had some sort of gnoll<br/>
 fur quest item.  I think I tricked myself (i&#39;m not playing eq now and <br/>
couldn&#39;t check).<br/>
 <br/>
 I think I had a gnoll fang that I couldn&#39;t sell.<br/>
 (Hopefully I&#39;m remembering correctly)<br/>
 <br/>
 Anyone know what to do with a gnoll fang?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

trainer next to the Pit of Doom in Halas the Barbarian enclave.  You have to <br/>
get 3 or more and you get a little exp and some copper.</div>
