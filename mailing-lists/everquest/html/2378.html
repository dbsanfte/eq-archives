<b>Subject:</b> Finally got on <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-560738903">Got a response from Sony, sent them the info they requested to <br/>
investigate on their end. Meanwhile, tried again just a bit after <br/>
midnight this morning, and went on fine.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this was just a little problem. Otherwise the conclusion <br/>
I might draw is that, for two days at many various times, I could not <br/>
get on because the login server was swamped. That bodes ill for all <br/>
of us.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Sony to continue the investigation even though the problem <br/>
seems to have gone away. I want some assurance that I can get on <br/>
whenever I want to play. I had plans for some extended play time on <br/>
my days off, and they were frustrated by this problem.<br/>
<br/>
On the up side, I got back to Baldur&#39;s Gate for a bit.<br/>
