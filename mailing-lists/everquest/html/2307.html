&gt; &gt; Having never played a<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; #1 DOn&#39;t feel rushed to get your first character<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; &gt; to higher levels.  EQ is<br/>
&gt; &gt; a huge place and there is so much to do and see. <br/>
&gt; If<br/>
&gt; &gt; you take your time you<br/>
&gt; &gt; will have a much better experience, IMHO!  (I<br/>
&gt; played<br/>
&gt; &gt; my Ranger for a year<br/>
&gt; &gt; and he only reached 27).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, and how often did you play? and and what really<br/>
&gt; took you that long? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Honestly man, what were you doing all that time?<br/>
