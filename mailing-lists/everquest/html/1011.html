<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-727528753">Hi, I just felt like getting this out of my system.<br/>
An idea I&#39;ve been running by anyone who will listen.<br/>
I was inspired by reading a JLA comic that had Mikaal/Starman III (from DC<br/>
Comics). He&#39;s a blue alien with reddish brown hair. It got me thinking...<br/>
wouldn&#39;t it be cool to have dark elves with different color hair? and then<br/>
an idea hit me: Dark Elf / Wood Elf hybrids! (aka Dark Wood Elves or DWE).<br/>
They would be blue with any color hair. Have skills like ultravision,<br/>
forage, hide, and sneak. They could be good, evil, or neutral. They could be<br/>
bards or rangers-- maybe a new class called trackers since I think a race<br/>
with ultravision would be a good at tracking (someone the other night was<br/>
complaining that none of the dark races have tracking skill). Regardless of<br/>
class, most other races would con apprehensive or dubious to them initially<br/>
bc of their odd looks. Maybe they could be on a new island in the OOT that<br/>
can be reached by boat from Butcherblock (like Kunark) and Freeport. Or they<br/>
could be on Antonica somewhere near Neriak. The history of their race would<br/>
be that they are the results of the children of Dark Elves and their Wood<br/>
Elf slaves/prisoners.<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to get Verant to pay attention to this idea. it could be in<br/>
an &quot;Elven Madness Expansion Pack&quot; or something...<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
luv,<br/>
