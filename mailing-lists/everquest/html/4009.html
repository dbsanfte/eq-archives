<div>That is you, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So glad you made it 
to FV... I know you found it disconcerting that it&#39;s so much quieter than you&#39;re 
used to, but you have to admit the absence (mostly) of moronic chatter is a nice 
change.&nbsp; :-)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry I couldn&#39;t talk to you that much... I was trying to spend time with 
my dear Druid love, and we also had some big guild business going on, and it was 
just hectic.&nbsp; :-)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you&#39;d like to meet sometime, I&#39;d be happy to teach you Elvish, and 
pretty much any other language you&#39;d like to learn. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Take care, brave Dwarf, and I shall see you in Norrath!</div>
