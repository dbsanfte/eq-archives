<div id="ygrps-yiv-973778428">I&#39;ve been questing for a Crude Stein for approximately 1 month now, and I&#39;ve <br/>
still yet to find one. Does anyone know for sure where you can get one, or <br/>
which quest you can get them from? I&#39;m even willing to buy one from someone <br/>
(on the Bertoxxulous server) and will discuss the price if you have one for <br/>
sale.</div>
