<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Gaming Death <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-888414307">In regards to death in game and such.  There was a time <br/>
when our highest level Cleric at the time was so <br/>
inundated with requests from  guildies to rez them <br/>
everytime they died.  It didn&#39;t matter that  there was a <br/>
cleric in the zone that was happy to do the rez, for a <br/>
small donation in most cases.  But the people that <br/>
either had not been smart enough to carry enough pp on <br/>
them or were just too cheap to donate for the rez were <br/>
mostly the ones to beg our cleric to rezz them.  Now our <br/>
cleric soon realized the pattern only after I had the  <br/>
gumption to mention it to him after I got a rezz from <br/>
him, luckily he was only one zone over from where I had <br/>
died and he was getting ready to log for the night so I <br/>
managed to catch him when he wasn&#39;t busy.  Once I showed <br/>
him the pattern he learned to not drop everything he was <br/>
doing to rezz the poor soul and also checked to see if <br/>
there was a cleric nearby before he even went to rezz <br/>
the peep.  Unfortunately he got  one request too many <br/>
when he was working on his Epic and he got fed up and <br/>
left guild.  But the few of us who didn&#39;t bother him <br/>
constantly if he was not busy he will still do teh rez <br/>
for  us IF and only If we were not able to find one on <br/>
our own.<br/>
<br/>
But the rezzes really are  more of a priviledge than a <br/>
right in the game. At least that is the way I see it.  I <br/>
pretty much solo a lot onmy own atm when i am really not <br/>
wanting to hurry up and level.  this helps me learn the <br/>
zone I am in a little better and  I rarely ask for a <br/>
rezz unless I have lost a level or I am very close to <br/>
ding.  And if I must go to the guild for a rezz i make <br/>
sure I have exhausted all the other avenues before going <br/>
to teh guild to see if any of our rezzers are on.  Hell <br/>
I&#39;ve even settled for a 35% on more occasion than I can <br/>
count  if that was the best i could get and was quite <br/>
happy with it. And i always make sure that I offer a <br/>
donation whether I have said I would donate or not.  <br/>
Most times when I do get teh rezz I have had the <br/>
donation rejected only because I made the effort to fork <br/>
over the pp.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings toward game <br/>
&gt; death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s attitudes <br/>
&gt; toward game death?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on <br/>
&gt; since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in <br/>
&gt; awkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t just <br/>
&gt; call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor do  <br/>
&gt; have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big <br/>
&gt; nasty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the <br/>
&gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all <br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server. He <br/>
&gt; is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and tactics <br/>
&gt; and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the <br/>
&gt; Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but enjoy <br/>
&gt; my independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career as <br/>
&gt; possible. <br/>
