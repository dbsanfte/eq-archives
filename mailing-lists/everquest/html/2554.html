<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023944765">When Froondor was just a level 1 or 2 druid in GFay, some kind soul did<br/>
something similar for him -- staked him to full leather (20-30 pp it cost)<br/>
and gave him some plat for spells. I asked if there was anything I could do<br/>
for him, and he said &quot;No, just do the same for someone else when you are at<br/>
a higher level and wealthy enough to do so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now that Froondor is level 41 and has a bit o plat in the bank he can afford<br/>
to help out new players some with plat and equipment; it&#39;s fun to &quot;pass on<br/>
the good deed,&quot; in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I will say, though, that he will not help out those people who go around<br/>
begging for armor, weapons, and money -- only random players who seem<br/>
deserving.<br/>
<br/>
And then there was the guy I gave a Sarnak Emblazened Tabard, a Straw Spun<br/>
Belt, and a few other items to because he seemed needy. I offered him a<br/>
barbed leather whip, and he said &quot;no thanks&quot; and showed me his Centi Short<br/>
Sword and SSoY. Grrrrrrr.<br/>

&gt; This is exactly what happened to me.  i had asked if<br/>
&gt; anyone could help a young druid stand a fighting<br/>
&gt; chance on her own...i was meaning just buffs...along<br/>
&gt; came this WONDERFUL person who suited me with some<br/>
&gt; basic leather armor and gave me 50pp to boot to help<br/>
&gt; buy my spells...i was amazed!!!  He said he was<br/>
&gt; fulfilling a promise...i will be glad to one day have<br/>
&gt; the opportunity to give back to another who is just<br/>
&gt; starting out...What is it they say...&quot;Pay It<br/>
&gt; Forward&quot;??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
