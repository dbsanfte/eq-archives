<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I don&#39;t generally have lag issues.&nbsp; I have a 
cable modem connection and I turn off some game options that would cause lag, 
like Spell Effects, full names, etc.&nbsp; And in some places, if necessary, 
I&#39;ll drop the clipp plane down a little.&nbsp; So assumng I&#39;m running at full 
speed with no lag, I still have a hard time soloing the tasks, even as a 64 
druid, mainly because of miscellaneous aggro in close quarters.&nbsp; Sure I can 
kite one or two mobs, but in close quarters, where adds are coming out of the 
woodwork, even greenies can beat you down.&nbsp; I&#39;m not big on soloing per 
se.&nbsp; It takes too long and requires too much attention.&nbsp; I prefer 
grouping anyway.&nbsp; XP is much quicker, and in a full group that knows what 
they&#39;re doing, I only have to snare/dot once per round as opposed to 2 or 3 per 
(high level) mob.So I don&#39;t waste nearly as much mana meaning I can do other 
things like back up heal, buff sporadically, or be available to evac if 
necessary.&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I understand that some people are limited to what 
kind of connections they can get in certain geographical areas, but personally I 
don&#39;t think satellite is one of the best connections to play EQ.&nbsp; You 
should try for an ISDN connection at least.&nbsp; Connection would probably be 
more stable, and your uplink would be roughly same speed as your 
downlink.</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font><br></div><tt>Well, certain classes are 
  able to solo mobs. I think skill is not the only issue. It&#39;s also a matter of 
  gear, class, and internet connection. Classes with pets, slows, and snares 
  have an advantage. Sure clerics can heal themselves, but only if they don&#39;t 
  get interrupted. Since omens came out I have been fizzling a LOT more for no 
  reason. Plus I have satellite internet which causes some upload latency. The 
  way the damage system is setup I get damage misreports and take 100+ damage 
  from an 18 damage hit. I was nearly owned by green mobs in straightup melee 
  even with haste and a delay 18 weapon with a proc. My spells were interrupted, 
  I lagged and couldn&#39;t get other spells off, and root was breaking instantly. I 
  was told that if I had ornate or elemental armor I would have a better chance 
  soloing.<br>I just wish they had tasks categorized as easy, medium, and 
  difficult, as well as short, medium, etc.. <br>Zoning can take a long time for 
  me so running from DL to Sebilis can take more time than I want to spend doing 
  a task.<br>I agree that it would be nice to get a more tangible 
  reward.<br>-Su<br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
