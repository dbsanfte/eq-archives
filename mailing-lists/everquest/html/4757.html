Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Being a halfling druid that was made about as badly as can be (no <br/>
bonus points into wisdom), I can see why a lower level character may <br/>
be felt left out in the cold with the changes to KEI (Long time in <br/>
coming I might add...and seeing the documentation on how that spell <br/>
was SUPPOSED to work in the first place). I am completely happy with <br/>
the change.  It DID affect me as my druid was only in low 40s when <br/>
correction to KEI was implemented.  I am not quite as bad off as the <br/>
other char, but I do see where four or five buffs and a few heals can <br/>
really impact the ole mana pool, but I see that as a learning tool.  <br/>
Druids are not clerics..never were...(and hopefully never will be).  <br/>
I also play a cleric (who ALSO was not made perfectly as far as <br/>
initial stats).  I can see a dramatic difference in his mana usage <br/>
when healing using the exact same spell (Greater Healing).  <br/>
<br/>
Being a senior officer and cofounder of a guild and 16 month player, <br/>
I have seen a lot of changes.  I would say I am happy with 90% of the <br/>
changes.  Seeing a newby player character log on and 3 weeks later <br/>
surpass me in level is a bit hard to take.  I am a single <br/>
professional adult and can play for several hours a day.  <br/>
Powerlevelling SUCKS if done for the sake of just level.   In the <br/>
past I have been very against PLing, but appreciate its benefits if <br/>
the PLing character and the PLed character understand that skills <br/>
suffer greatly without appropriate buffs and APPROPRIATE (not <br/>
twinkie) gear.  I can personally say I have done PLing, but I prefer <br/>
to call it Powerskilling..not powerlevelling, because I don&#39;t fight <br/>
reds or yellows....I fight whites and dark blues...not as much xp and <br/>
you get more time to work your skills.<br/>
<br/>
I think the changes are good because of the apparent rampant <br/>
disregard for proper (or appropriate) character development.  I <br/>
cannot count the number of times I have been killed because of the <br/>
times where some PL&#39;d twink without a clue is in a group with me and <br/>
cannot even land a heal because he fizzles so much.  Or land a DD / <br/>
DoT or even a buff here and there.  (Or a ranger/warrior who cannot <br/>
hit the broad side of a barn from inside, or taunt a rat off cleric <br/>
because PLed twink bleeds so much because his defense and AC suck and <br/>
the cleric had to draw agro with heals...etc...)<br/>
<br/>
I can recall a day where some new 1st level character was bragging in <br/>
OOC that they had almost 4000 hp...I was like...umm...???  And for a <br/>
caster that has had the KEI bottle since birth...I can understand <br/>
that they feel abandoned.  IMHO..Too bad... I cannot stand seeing a <br/>
lower level caster without worn spots on the seat of their pants.  <br/>
Hehe.  I know of several characters that are relatively new that <br/>
constantly whine about &quot;I cannot chain nuke or chain heal anymore!&quot; : <br/>
shedding tears :   Yep..these were NEW players...they just happened <br/>
to get the Aqua goblin camps regularly and didn&#39;t have appropriate <br/>
respect for the difficulty for most newer players in getting more <br/>
than a few plat from a few hours of playing in 99% of the newby zones.<br/>
<br/>
I heard a lot of people talk about how PoP ruined a druids main <br/>
source of income (porting).  I think the benefit to the other classes <br/>
in promoting getting around to other places is more of a help to the <br/>
game overall than a hinderance to the druids and wizzies that relied <br/>
on that (porting) as a primary source of income.<br/>
<br/>
[end rant]  :)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, As more and more people play the game, and provide <br/>
feedback, I think SoE is trying to continuously balance the character <br/>
classes and the game overall.  This will positively impact some and <br/>
negatively impact others.  I would imagine they want a happy medium.  <br/>
I am pretty sure SoE isn&#39;t too concerned about the few folks who <br/>
leave the game for perhaps another (SoE has several).  The game is <br/>
extremely popular and is getting more so.<br/>
<br/>
And most of all, please remember that SoE isn&#39;t doing all of this for <br/>
our enjoyment.  $imply for Sony&#39;s bottom line. :)</div>
