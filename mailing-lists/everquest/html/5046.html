line and it only took 27 minutes, far cry from 23 hours LOL. I am <br/>
headed home for lunch to play :)<br/>

&gt; Yeah. If you opt to get the download only version you might want to <br/>
suck up<br/>
&gt; to a friend to burn copies of the files onto a CD and send to you.<br/>
&gt; I was shocked when I found a woman in the hardware store in this <br/>
small town<br/>
&gt; who actually plays EQ.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Awhile back they had a patch where you could opt to download it in <br/>
smaller<br/>
&gt; chunks as they became available...  all you had to do was click on <br/>
yes.<br/>
&gt; This is exactly what they were tryign to avoid because the network <br/>
traffic<br/>
&gt; ties up the bandwidth when people do this and nobody can connect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; T1 will still take a good chunk of time, but not an entire day.<br/>

&gt;   I did something really stupid last night. I logged into Everquest <br/>
and<br/>
&gt;   opted to purchase LDoN online. One suggestion, DON&#39;T do it if you<br/>
&gt;   have a 56K dial-up connection LOL. It started to download and <br/>
said it<br/>
&gt;   would take 22 hours and 26 minutes! I guess I will take my laptop <br/>
to<br/>
&gt;   work and download it on the T1 LOL. Sheesh!<br/>
