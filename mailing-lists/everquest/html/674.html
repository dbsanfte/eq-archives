 Hehe you wanna know something? I&#39;m going to join Scarlet Horizon, but before <br/>
I can join I have to do this quest, and Galihad said my quest was to get <br/>
GhoulBane hehehe(btw Elayna ROCKS!:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well we would love to have ya!  Quests to join our guild are never easy, but <br/>
Galihad has given you a particularly tough one it seems :)  It would also be <br/>
good if you visit our website and post some information about yourself on the <br/>
general message board.<br/>
<br/>
Elayna does Rock!  She is known as Guk Girl in our guild and has spent almost <br/>
all of her last 35 levels exclusively in upper and lower Guk (She is 47th lvl <br/>
now I believe).  She is helped many a soul who have ran in to harms way in <br/>
that magnificent dungeon.  She is our guilds Guk expert and she is still <br/>
discovering new things about Guk every week.<br/>
