<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261487858">I was in a group in PoV one day when the tank could not keep aggro off of anyone. I don&#39;t know why, I guess his dps wasn&#39;t that good. The shaman was ready to leave bc he kept getting aggro and the tank had a hard time taunting off of him for some reason. So I decided to protect the shammy and as soon as the shammy slowed I would stun the mob and run up within melee range and start bashing the hell out of it. I was actually better at getting aggro than the tank. lol. I&#39;ve had to do that for chanters too. So long as I can take the hits it&#39;s ok.<br/>

Gotta agree with ya there Su.  With my lvl 67 Shammy i find that my slows tend to pull agro away from the tank and  i have to automatically start melee as soon as the mob gets close to me  until the Tank can steal agro back until i cast my DoT on em and regain agro again lol.  I have learned as well to not run away either cause that brief moment when you turn away could get ya killed a lot faster  if you don&#39;t just stand there melee back and hope yer healer (druid/Shaman/ Cleric/ or even Ranger) can get a heal off on ya before too long.  Prim example was last night in Harbingers and I wound up getting the agro form a Named and wound up melee cause we had a crap load of ads and even with my AoE slow i still managed to not only get the named but the adds at the same time .  Luckily I had my Shammy 1.5 in hand and clicked it to help keep me alive till The cleric could get a heal off on me and the rest of the melee could draw the adds and such away form this almost dead shimmy =)<br/>

True. I had people laughing at me when I was in my 40s and 50s level range because I wanted to melee a bit and let the mobs try to hit me to make my defense go up. They said I would never need defense and I didn&#39;t need to worry about it. However, being able to dodge hits can really come in handy and sometimes I have had to melee mobs to death when oom and having to kill a mob that is running away. A single bash can be the difference between killing a mob and getting a ton of adds.<br/>

I hate to be the one to say this but you really should focus on your <br/>
battle skills. Trust me, at the lower levels that is a perfect time to <br/>
get the skills built up. I can understand wanting to go in and just beat <br/>
the heck out of everything and being uber and killing it all in one <br/>
shot. But ponder this, When you get to be up in levels (50&#39;s, 60&#39;s, and <br/>
70&#39;s) you are going to be taking on some majorly nasty monsters. If you <br/>
have just gained levels and have an uber weapon but never really worked <br/>
on your fighting skills and they are low, it&#39;s not going to help you or <br/>
your party out very much. Actually you will hurt your group more than <br/>
help them. Now being a Shammy you have some awesome spells at higher <br/>
levels. This is another thing I would suggest focusing on. If your at a <br/>
higher level and your fighting say a dragon and 60% of your casts fizz <br/>
then you may as well run or be able to hit! (See first part) otherwise <br/>
your gonna get killed or your group killed.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my 2 cents.<br/>
