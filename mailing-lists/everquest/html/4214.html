<div id="ygrps-yiv-845732068">I was in EQOA from Beta 1 until end of beta.  The game is much different <br/>
from PC EQ.  I had a lot of fun but alot of other long time EQ players <br/>
didn&#39;t like it.  The &#39;feel&#39; of the game is totally different.  The game <br/>
mechanics are different.  It&#39;s a totally different game.  Don&#39;t buy EQOA <br/>
for it to be a clone of EQ.<br/>
The people who were the most blown away by EQ were the console gamers. <br/>
They really had a blast.  It was fun showing them some of the basics <br/>
about the EQ world and making them so happy.<br/>
In order to play EQOA you need an network adapter.  Some people have <br/>
trouble finding this so buy that before EQOA comes out if you are <br/>
planning to buy it. I bought mine off Ebay, make sure the person you buy <br/>
from has a high rating and it&#39;s new in box.<br/>
  It is also recommended that you have a USB capable keyboard.  They do <br/>
provide a menu system for the most common phrases but  it&#39;s clunky to <br/>
use all the time.  I recommend you play for at least a day without the <br/>
keyboard to familiarize yourself with the controller.  The point of <br/>
console gaming is so you don&#39;t have to sit at a desk, lay on the couch <br/>
and use the controller for a while.<br/>
One thing I don&#39;t like is you are limited to 4 people in a group.  I <br/>
also don&#39;t like that they fixed my 200 damage quested weapon, I was the <br/>
Battle Druid for a while there, hehe.  You get used to the small group <br/>
tho, there&#39;s a nice bonus for big groups.  Best way to get levels is in <br/>
a full group.<br/>
Crgaming has a nice site up about EQOA, has info on each of the races <br/>
and classes.  They posted a dev chat today.</div>
