<div id="ygrps-yiv-323363859">Yeah, the bazaar is a bit laggy, but I find that if you&#39;re working in<br/>
various windows (trader, bazaar, inventory) look down at the ground or<br/>
face a wall.  Makes things LOTS faster!!<br/>

Subject: bazaar<br/>
<br/>
Went there this morning to set up some sales. Lag was terrible. It <br/>
was hard to even get my cursor on target. I suppose it will be ok <br/>
once I get set up to sell, but the set up is terrible. Move cursor. <br/>
Not on object. Move a bit more. Not on object. Move back. Click. <br/>
Don&#39;t have object. Click again. Hmph. Had object but didn&#39;t know it, <br/>
and just put it back. Click...<br/>
<br/>
Took so long that I didn&#39;t finish setting up before I had to log. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have logged if I could have left my toon to do business <br/>
while I was gone, but no such luck.<br/>
<br/>
I just gotta get another machine, faster connection, and retire from <br/>
my job so that I can play all the time.<br/>
