<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Use macros to communicate(was About loot order) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-237582870">Wow! Thank you so much! I had no idea how to setup the macros. i was<br/>
wondering how people did it! This will help me alot!<br/>
How do I set up an attack macro that says something everytime I start to<br/>
attack? Like if I want to say &quot;Don&#39;t run! We aer your friends&quot; when I begin<br/>
attacking?<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; Unfortunately, there are always jerks.  Unfortunately, there are always<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fizzles.  And mobs hitting the cleric, etc. etc.  I don&#39;t have as good of a<br/>
solution to the jerks as was volunteered earlier(make a character on your<br/>
server and yell at the jerks you have to deal with), but I do have one to<br/>
show all in your group you are doing, or at least trying to do, your job as<br/>
a healer.  The solution is set up and use macros.  At level 28, I have two<br/>
main heal macros.  Each one states I am healing or greater healing the<br/>
person I have targeted.  It also tells them to stay close as sometimes folks<br/>
walk out of range of a heal.  This is my basic macro set up.  You have five<br/>
lines to work with in a macro and my greater heal spell is in slot 1:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; /sit off<br/>
&gt; /g Casting Greater Heal on %t.  Stay close friend.<br/>
&gt; /cast 1<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I include /sit off so I can hit the macro whether I am medding or not.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The /g will groupsay whatever you want.  %t returns your target&#39;s name.<br/>
/Cast 1 casts the spell in your first spell slot.  You can do /cast 1 to<br/>
/cast 8 for any of your slots.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I also have macros to state a mob is &quot;On me, can&#39;t heal&quot; or &quot;I just cast<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Divine Aura, I can&#39;t heal - get this mob off me&quot; or &quot;Zone zone zone.  Your<br/>
cleric is on his way to zone!&quot;  By the way, I don&#39;t always run for zone, but<br/>
it sure gets their attention that we might have a problem.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I find if you tell folks what you are doing, they stop asking.  Also, any<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time I med, I call out that I am medding and how much mana I have.  My macro<br/>
for that is:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; /book<br/>
&gt; /g Medding.  My mana is at...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then I tell them 50% or whatever it happens to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe some don&#39;t like the fact I say over and over again what I am doing,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but I find most appreciate it.  I can&#39;t please everyone.  And when someone<br/>
asks why you Greater Healed so and so 4 times in a row, I say I didn&#39;t, I<br/>
had a bad fizzle streak.  They can see how quickly each of my healing<br/>
messages came and realize themselves what happened - a good thing.  Enough.<br/>
Too much caffeine.<br/>
