&gt;Subject: Re: Looking for item<br/>
&gt;My point exactally..  whats the point of playing the game with what &gt;you <br/>
&gt;have muled over from another character.. hehe Does it make the &gt;game <br/>
&gt;progress any faster.. NO. Just play the game as its meant, if &gt;you do it <br/>
&gt;any other way...why its just a glorified irc chat room.  &gt;You still cant <br/>
&gt;fight anything beyond your level, you just stand out &gt;someone whos trying <br/>
&gt;to bypass the system, and most people will look &gt;down on you as someone who <br/>
&gt;cant handle the game.  Nothing personal i &gt;just put all twinkies in the <br/>
&gt;same catogery.  The game is just not &gt;that hard, but as in real life <br/>
&gt;everyone is looking for a<br/>
&gt;handout.  Later... Smile... :)<br/>
