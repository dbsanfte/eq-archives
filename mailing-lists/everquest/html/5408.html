<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763499883">Ahh. Ok. Most of the time when I group with monks, even if there is a<br/>
warrior they can maintain aggro and I just keep healing. Only works when I<br/>
have C3 though. Works a little better now that I have my 7th shawl bc the<br/>
flowing thought stacks with KEI. :-)<br/>

I was talking about monks when I said that it isnot the warriors job to keep<br/>
aggro off of them. In some of them more complicated encounters, this is the<br/>
hardest part, keeping the mob off the first mob in the rotation. I play a<br/>
cleric also :)<br/>
