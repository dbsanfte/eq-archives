 homeworld - same o real time strategy but just in 3d. you build, you get a <br/>
 load of little ships, you kill. and the cycle continues till you beat the <br/>
 mission. BORING<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your ignorance shines.  That is like saying - &quot;Everquest - same ol RPing game <br/>
but just in 3d. you hunt, you kill, you gain a lvl, and the cycle continues <br/>
till your high enough lvl to camp the great items.  BORING&quot;<br/>
<br/>
you can apply your simplistic view incorrectly to any game to sound pithy, <br/>
but you are wrong as was my sarcastic analogy using EQ.  I&#39;m no big fan of <br/>
C&C games or Starcraft - I like truly immersive, original, and meticulously <br/>
designed games - Homeworld is a great game - EQ is as well.  I guarantee <br/>
anyone who tries Homeworld will be astounded with what the folks at Relic <br/>
games have accomplished.  It is sooooo much more than the typical harvest and <br/>
build RTS.  The story and music alone set it apart.  Only three games have <br/>
captured my attention totally and completely in the last 2 years:<br/>
<br/>
Myth: The Fallen Lords<br/>
EverQuest<br/>
Homeworld<br/>
<br/>
Wizaro Wrathcaster<br/>
Solusek Ro<br/>

&quot;If lvl 29 isn&#39;t a hell lvl I can&#39;t imagine 30&quot;</div>
