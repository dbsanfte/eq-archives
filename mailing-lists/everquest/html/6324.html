  <div><br></div><tt>I posted this in another EQ group as well...<br><br>As most 
  know already, I havent been playing in awhile...stuff never<br>seems to work 
  out like I want it too and $%^&amp;*(...im sure most of you<br>feel me on 
  that, lol.<br><br>Anyway..i got an email from sony about everquest the 
  otherday and they<br>said I had 21 days free for me to comeback to EQ ( 
  something like<br>that) and such. They also said that because of the server 
  mergers, any<br>toons under 10 that havent been played in 6 months were 
  deleted..:-(<br><br>I had 2 toons under 10, one on each account. I had a level 
  9 rogue who<br>was my bazaar trader and a level 2 ranger ( who replaced a much 
  higher<br>ranger that I didnt like). They both had some good stuff on them, 
  esp<br>the ranger. Im assuming since this stuff was on them or in 
  their<br>banks, that the stuff is gone. Many hours of hunting and killing 
  and<br>many many several thousand plat gone and lost. Is there any way 
  I<br>could get this stuff back when I return or is there a chance the 
  stuff<br>is there even tho the toons arent ( its been over a year since i 
  last<br>played regularly, 9 months since i last logged in)<br><br>/em is 
  depressed and cries like a schoolboy who got kicked in the<br>crotch by the 
  mean little girl who had a crush on him.<br><br>Greg<br><br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
