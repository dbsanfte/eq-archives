<div id="ygrps-yiv-174563399"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have a 5th level monk in freeport on fennin ro. I<br/>
&gt;decided early on to use dual hammers as weapons this<br/>
&gt;seems to work out well my stats are ( Or close to) DW<br/>
&gt;38 OF 27 Def 28 HTH 12 Kick 17. So here are my<br/>
&gt;questions. One should I give up on the Hammers and<br/>
&gt;just use my fists ( They seem to do simular damage I<br/>
&gt;just like the Hammers) Or should I keep using the<br/>
&gt;hammers or switch to another weapon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Give up the hammers -now- friend.  It&#39;s only a shame you didn&#39;t do so <br/>
sooner, but it&#39;s not too late to fix the problem with little trouble.  Soon <br/>
you&#39;ll see, you&#39;ll never do as much damage with that weapon (or any weapon) <br/>
as you&#39;ll be able to do with your fists.  It&#39;s only hurting you, in keeping <br/>
your hand to hand skill from raising.<br/>
