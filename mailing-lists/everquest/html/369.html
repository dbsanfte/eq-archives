<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778690946">Hello.-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just got the game and played this weekend but I have a problem with the<br/>
resolution.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 3DBlaster Voodoo2 and the game recognizes it and works fine at<br/>
640x480.<br/>
But when I go and click on the resolution option to change it the game hangs<br/>
up totally. I tried again and I waited, maybe the game was loading something<br/>
but nothing, all movement in the screen stops and the game hangs.<br/>
<br/>
How can I change the resolution? I would like to achieve 800x600.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot.<br/>
