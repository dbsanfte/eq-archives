<div id="ygrps-yiv-948711336">Greetings, I&#39;m a new member with a couple of comments on the new <br/>
task system.  I have a full compliment of alts on the Maelyn <br/>
Starpyre server and was playing with my little cleric (lvl 25) the <br/>
other day. I started a task and got booted from the net when my net <br/>
security picked up someone trying to get on my system. I had <br/>
collected all of my objects and was working on my kills for the <br/>
task. I lost all of the objects and the kills.  I got back on and <br/>
found that. I tried again later that night and did not finish before <br/>
I got to tired to play. Again, it was all gone when I logged back <br/>
on. So tasks have to be finished before you log or get booted. I&#39;m <br/>
laughing about it now but at the time it was very frustrating.<br/>

a list of tasks to choose from.  Rezize your task window to see the <br/>
rewards.  These tasks are not easily soloable, but if you get a <br/>
group you can finish them fairly quickly.  My first task was to <br/>
collect 4 bone chips and kill 10 reanimated mobs in Chardok.  It <br/>
took awhile but it was good xp and a 58pp reward.<br/>
