<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668222024">I was wondering if anyone know if there is like rank or reputation in<br/>
EverQuest, can you be known as a hero, master or even a villain or <br/>
murderer? And are there guild ranks like lieutenant? I suppose the ranks<br/>
would be different for different guilds, wizards would have archmages<br/>
while paladins would have lieutenants and sergeants..?<br/>
