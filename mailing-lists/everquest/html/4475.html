<b>Subject:</b> New Guild Forming on the Starpyre Server <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-592308206">I created an Ikky Monk last week on the Starpyre server.  I soloed him form<br/>
lvl 1 to lvl 10 which took me about a total of 24 hours (most of that time I<br/>
was working on my curscale armor).  Form there I went form lvl 10 to lvl 16<br/>
in Kurn&#39;s Tower that took me about 6 hours game time in group.  Then from<br/>
lvl 16 to 22 which I accomplished in roughly 3 hours in Paludal Caverns<br/>
bouncing back and forth between  B1 and B2.<br/>
<br/>
In all that I am also helping form a new guild on the Starpyre and once we<br/>
get approved by SOE we will be called Raiders of the Twilight. We already<br/>
have a guild message board and a guild website.  And we are recruiting<br/>
right now. if anyone is interested send me an email.<br/>
