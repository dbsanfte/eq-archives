<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821908245">Hi, everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only been playing EQ a few months, and I have a ranger on Tarew Marr<br/>
who has just made 12th level and a warrior who&#39;s at 3rd level. I keep<br/>
looking for strategies for each character all over the Web, but one thing<br/>
eludes me. Of course, that&#39;s making platinum. I keep seeing all these books<br/>
for sale on how to make platinum easily and quickly, but I keep writing them<br/>
off as scams. Are there any half-decent methods for growing wealthier?<br/>
<br/>
