<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065183876">I have quit playing on several different occasions, a<br/>
couple of times for 3 months, once for over 4 months.<br/>
I have always re-activated my account and all my<br/>
characters and items were just as I left them. I would<br/>
say that if you want to stop playing for the summer,<br/>
when you re-activate your account, all will be well.<br/>

&gt; question.... if i cant play for a few months, stop<br/>
&gt; payment on the account. How long is my char saved,<br/>
&gt; is there a way to save it wehn I feel like coming<br/>
&gt; back to play?  These next few months are filled with<br/>
&gt; many things that will keep me away from home, lots<br/>
&gt; of traveling, and I would rather nor waste the money<br/>
&gt; when I could keep my chars in tact thru some means. <br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
