<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508861187"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; For the record, does Luclin run slow for everyone? The only time I ever go<br/>
&gt; up there is to get spells for my Druid because of the major lag I have had<br/>
&gt; there ever since it came out. It takes me twice as long to zone there than<br/>
&gt; it does anywhere else in the game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It depends on the zone. I zone into nexus and bazaar fairly quickly because<br/>
they are small zones. But shadowhaven is a large zone with alot of npcs and<br/>
it can take up to 5 min to zone in. I take longer to zone into some places<br/>
in velious than in luclin though. Shadowhaven is the slowest zoning in place<br/>
I have found though. Lag isn&#39;t too bad though.<br/>
