<div id="ygrps-yiv-802833840"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;im pretty much a newb only been playing a month the<br/>
&gt;only other place i have travelled is around gfay as<br/>
&gt;an elf. so as everyone i meet in luclin seems to solo<br/>
&gt;and are pretty much unfriendly overall, i would <br/>
&gt;like to ask here if anyone would like to group for a<br/>
&gt;coupla hours? or if anyone can offer advice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most classes are capable of soloing thru to lvl 19-20<br/>
anyways, that&#39;s when the game &quot;begins&quot;. At lvl 13<br/>
you&#39;re getting into the level range for Crocs in<br/>
Oasis, just head down there and solo or duo yourself<br/>
up to 19-20. (groups larger than two people at that<br/>
point just slow down the experience gain) Since you&#39;re<br/>
new, i&#39;ll give you directions how to get there. Take<br/>
the teleport from The Nexus down to West Commonlands,<br/>
go east from there to the East Commonlands and ask<br/>
someone to show you where the EC Tunnel is. Go thru<br/>
the tunnel turning right at the Shady Swashbuckler<br/>
into Northern Desert of Ro. Head to the left til you<br/>
hit the water and follow the beach to the Oasis of<br/>
Marr. Continue following the beach til you get to the<br/>
docks there, that&#39;s the rest stop in Oasis. Just go<br/>
further down the beach and look for crocs of various<br/>
levels to kill. (starting with Crocodiles and Caimans<br/>
on the low end, til Deepwater Crocs on the high end)<br/>
<br/>
Once you ding 20, head either to *shudder* LOIO (Lake<br/>
of Ill Omen) on Kunark, or my personal preferance, the<br/>
Karanas. (Eastern, Northern and Southern Plains of<br/>
Karana) I&#39;m not too familiar with the Beastlord class,<br/>
but as a pet class you shouldn&#39;t have too much<br/>
difficulty soloing in the Karanas. You&#39;ll be a little<br/>
more likely to find groups in LOIO if that&#39;s what you<br/>
really want, but friendly groups? Probably not. LOIO<br/>
is the haven for all the mouthy thirteen year olds who<br/>
want to bicker over the &quot;phat lewt&quot; dropped by a<br/>
Sarnak. It also happens to be the best XP spot in the<br/>
game for that level range and there is halfway decent<br/>
coin on the MOBs. Pick your poison. :) <br/>
<br/>
As for roleplaying, I can&#39;t speak for FV as a server<br/>
myself not having played there. I suppose your best<br/>
bet is to come up with a good roleplaying<br/>
justification for people to want to group with you. In<br/>
terms of simply enjoying the game mechanics though,<br/>
grouping with any more than one person before level 20<br/>
is just going to slow down your progress. :)<br/>
