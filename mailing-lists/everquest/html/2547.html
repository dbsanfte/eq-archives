<div id="ygrps-yiv-994373554">Here&#39;s a quest to get a weapon better than rusty..<br/>
Go to the Ranger guild (one level up from the druid guild) and find Dill<br/>
Fireshine. He asks you to bring him two orc hatchets from the &quot;blue<br/>
meanies&quot;. The merchants sell them for 6pp a piece so it&#39;s not worth buying<br/>
them. Just look for an orc pawn that has an axe. Check to make sure it&#39;s a<br/>
hatchet and not a rusty axe. When you have two hatchets, give them to you<br/>
and he usually gives you two weapons in return. If you can&#39;t use them or<br/>
think they suck, then sell them to the merchant that you have the best<br/>
faction with.<br/>
Also, if you run around the area near the lifts and the ruins, sometimes a<br/>
bright green patch spawns on the ground. It&#39;s evergreen leaves. They sell<br/>
for about 2 to 5pp a piece depending on who your buyer is and how much they<br/>
want to spend.<br/>
If you&#39;re high enough to go into Butcherblock then start to follow the path<br/>
(right after you zone in from Faydark) and instead of keeping to the path,<br/>
run straight accross to the two houses (right thru the pit). along the way<br/>
Oak Bark sometimes spawns on the ground. That is an item that sells for a<br/>
good price too. It&#39;s rarer.<br/>
That&#39;s assuming you are a woodelf druid though.<br/>

&gt; her own Druid, Amaiya (Ayonae Ro).  BF had suggested<br/>
&gt; asking around for a Fine Steel Scimitar but I have so<br/>
&gt; little money right now and the guy I talked to last<br/>
&gt; night wanted 10pp for the one he had...sheeeesh, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even have 1pp yet...lol(but hey I am having<br/>
&gt; fun)..sow, no wait, that should be so, any suggestions<br/>
&gt; on a less expensive &quot;weapon&quot; and where i might find<br/>
&gt; it.  I tend to hang out close to the lifts so I can<br/>
&gt; run like hell if I have to so if there is somewhere<br/>
&gt; near there that would be helpful...<br/>
