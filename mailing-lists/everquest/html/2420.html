<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342293656">Once the cd-key is used to unlock an account its useless. its branded into<br/>
that account. So either get your account or someone elses to play on, or buy<br/>
the game.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Cd-Key!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, I&#39;m an old EQ user, but i gave me account to a friend.  I played <br/>
DAOC for a little, but its boring and I want to get back to EQ.  The <br/>
problem is, my friend is still using the account and my cd-key.  Is <br/>
there any former players that don&#39;t need their cd-keys and they could <br/>
possible e-mail it to me? i would greatly appreciate it.  If <br/>
not....i&#39;ll have to buy the game...again.<br/>
<br/>
