<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608599928"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Hmm.. So if I wanted to cancel casting I could click horsie away and<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Or is there too much delay?<br/>
&gt; i never tried it... when i am in a raid (no extreme zones), it don&#39;t care<br/>
&gt; too much about interrupting casts, and i nuke dead mobs quite often.<br/>
&gt; just to make sure they are really dead... ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, my last few raids no enchanter has given me crack no matter how much<br/>
I&#39;ve asked-- despite the fact that I was one of the few clerics... And I was<br/>
specifically thinking if I accidentally hit the wrong hotkey and wanted to<br/>
interrupt before I gated or rooted myself.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; safefall is cool. I&#39;d like to see people jumping off kelethin on horses.<br/>
&gt; there is sort of an &quot;feature&quot; (aka bug) in Plane of Sky.<br/>
&gt; for those of you who don&#39;t know PoS:<br/>
&gt;  - you need a 46+ whizzy to get there<br/>
&gt;  - there are many small isles connected by &quot;teleports&quot;<br/>
&gt;  - you need some loot to get a key after you killed boss of isle<br/>
&gt;  - to leave PoS you jump of an isle and after you leave the zone<br/>
&gt;    you will keep on falling into the water in west freeport<br/>
&gt;  - on leaving the zone, all keys will vanish even if they<br/>
&gt;    aren&#39;t NO RENT<br/>
&gt;  - Call of Hero (Summon Player to casting Mage) does not<br/>
&gt;    work<br/>
&gt;  - levitate doesn&#39;t work (so no way back to 1st isle)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wow. sounds nasty.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; so people try to keep keys on corpses or leave char logged in PoS.<br/>
&gt; the problems with corpses: they rot after a week, and you need it<br/>
&gt; on first isle. but it costs some pp to get necro up there to summon<br/>
&gt; corpse. and a logged out char can&#39;t just walk/fly back to 1st isle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would never leave my corpse sitting that long...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; on one of my last PoS raids i discovered the following thing: jump<br/>
&gt; off an isle mounted. when you reach the zoneline, you get the message<br/>
&gt; that you have fallen beneath the world and are moved to the safespot<br/>
&gt; in the zone... and this happens to be on 1st isle... ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool. But I think I&#39;ll stay away from that zone.<br/>
luv,<br/>
