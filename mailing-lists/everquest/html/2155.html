<div id="ygrps-yiv-30291196">You dont need a credit card.  You can buy game cards at many places, I got<br/>
mine at Computer City.  I just think its easier than putting it on a credit<br/>
card.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] i need help<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am in need of help.  I used to play everquest all the time using a <br/>
friends username and password until he changed his password and never <br/>
told me what the new one was.  I know i am about to ask a stupid <br/>
question but is there any way that anyone would let me use their <br/>
username and password.  I would be very greatful and i would stay off <br/>
of the severs you use, and i would help you anyway that i could.  I <br/>
would get a username and password if i could but i dont have a credit <br/>
card.  I&#39;m sorry if i have bothered any of you fine gamers but i just <br/>
had to ask.  and if you will let me use your username and password <br/>
email me.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to read this.        <br/>
