recall correctly, you get 5 points to train with for every level.  If you<br/>
lose a level and gain it again, do you get another 5 points?  I&#39;m guessing<br/>
Verant would be smarter than that.  But what about gaining a level, going<br/>
and spending your 5 points, then losing and re-gaining the level again.<br/>
Just something I&#39;m curious about, anyone tested it?<br/>
