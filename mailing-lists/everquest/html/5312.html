<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If you ask these people who have 100k plat and more 
they will all pretty much tell you the same thing.&nbsp; It takes hours and 
hours of work, and whatever you do...don&#39;t spend what you have.&nbsp; It&#39;s kinda 
like buying a car.&nbsp; You work your job, you put a little aside each paycheck 
to save up until you have enough to go out and buy the car.&nbsp; The other 
thing&nbsp;is that the people who have this kind of money are high level and go 
on lots of raids so they get a fair split of the loot which always seems to give 
them nice gear along the way.&nbsp; That means they&#39;re not having to spend their 
money on gear.&nbsp; If you tried to do this at around level 20 it would take 
you awhile, mainly becuase the amount of loot and the type of items you get off 
mobs aren&#39;t as nice as the loot and items you get off higher mobs.&nbsp; Suffice 
to say, I don&#39;t see a lot of lower level toons riding around on horses... unless 
that person has a higher level alt with the plat to spare to buy that horse for 
the toon.&nbsp; I&#39;m like you, I&#39;ve never had more than 5k at a time.&nbsp; I 
thought it was a red letter day when I broke 2k. Then I spent 1500pp on nice 
armor for one of my lower level toons and there went all my money.</font></div>
