<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501203249"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Truly excellent stuff, Su. Thank you for sharing the link.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The scariest thing was that I found the link at www.wilwheaton.net<br/>
I was bored and looking of the Star Trek cast members and stuff. He actually<br/>
runs and makes his own webpage. He doesnt&#39; hire anyone, he does it all<br/>
himself. which is pretty cool.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone else jumped in and chided us for &quot;being harsh&quot; so I decided to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>give<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the beggar 2pp just to see what happened. I tracked her down near<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Felwithe,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hailed her, and gave her 2pp. The VERY next thing she says to me is &quot;you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>got<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; any caster stuff?&quot; Not &quot;Thank You&quot;, not even &quot;ty&quot; or &quot;thx&quot;, just &quot;you got<br/>
&gt; any caster stuff&quot;. I just said &quot;No, I am a Ranger, sorry&quot; and turned and<br/>
&gt; left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hate when that happens. You give someone something and they start asking<br/>
you for stuff. and you&#39;re like, I don&#39;t have anything. Some guy was<br/>
following me around asking for money and I was like &quot;I spent it all on my<br/>
new spells!&quot; and they&#39;re like &quot;Oh, can you give me any armor&quot; and Im like &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t have any.&quot; and then they asked for weapons. I was like &quot;I sold all of<br/>
the stuff that I did not need so I could buy my spells&quot;.<br/>
And I had the same thing where I gave someone something and rather than a<br/>
thanks they asked for more stuff. I would never ask for more stuff. I try to<br/>
offer people something in return when they give me something. Like today a<br/>
high lvl chanter walked up and gave me a platinum jasper ring because I had<br/>
checked for some items on allakhazam for her and reported to her that they<br/>
werent&#39; listed.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; A few minutes later this same person was back spamming the zone for tiny<br/>
&gt; daggers (ingredient to cast pet) because she &quot;looked everywhere in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Felwithe&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and &quot;couldn&#39;t find them anywhere&quot;. I have played a HE enchanter, so I KNOW<br/>
&gt; you can buy them for 1sp each from one of the 4 merchants in the room<br/>
 </span></blockquote>where<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the Enchanter Guildmaster is, so I repeated that information in /ooc. She<br/>
&gt; then asks for money to buy them because she didn&#39;t have any. I told her in<br/>
&gt; /ooc &quot;An enchanter can get 1 sp for a wasp wing, and that happens to be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; much a tiny dagger costs. Start killing stuff and stop begging.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hate when people do that too. You give them something and they act like<br/>
they have nothing. Scam artists.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess maybe I was a litte harsh to that newbie chanter, yes, but I have<br/>
&gt; used my Druid&#39;s bank account to equip numerous new druids and rangers in<br/>
&gt; that zone with full leather armor, a half-way decent newbie weapon, and a<br/>
&gt; little buffing (skin like diamond, sow, strength of stone, thorns, regen),<br/>
&gt; but not because they begged. I did it because they seemed to be players<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wanted to have fun and to play the game right, but needed a little boost,<br/>
&gt; and I enjoy helping people. I don&#39;t enjoy beggars, though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you weren&#39;t harsh. You were giving them a reality check. They needed to know<br/>
that it was unacceptable behavior and would not get them anywhere later in<br/>
game.<br/>
My druid at level 8 was giving out patchwork armor to newbies after she<br/>
turned in CB belts. I would do a /who 1 5 and then pick people I could find<br/>
to give armor to.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else have thoughts to share on players who spam the newbie zones<br/>
&gt; asking to be given free money or items? I would be interested to see how<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; others on this mailing list feel about the subject.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The other day some idiot was using /shout mode to try to sell his account.<br/>
People told him it was against the rules. I told him privately that if he<br/>
wanted to sell something to please use /auction. Yet a barrage of /ooc and<br/>
/shouts began. Someone accused the person who complained of being a narc and<br/>
a malcontent. The idiot shouted 3 more times to sell his account and the<br/>
complainer said that they had reported the person for violation of the terms<br/>
of service. Then there was a big /ooc name calling thing of people arguing<br/>
over who won a duel (someone claimed they had beaten the complainer in a<br/>
duel) and the person went on to say that the person they duelled was twinked<br/>
and so on.. I just started ignoring it after awhile.<br/>
Oh, and today I did /ooc to ask for support for planning a huge raid in<br/>
nagafen&#39;s lair. I said my plan was to get as many lvl 53+ to come in as<br/>
first wave of attack to clear the giants and a path to nagafen. (bc I&#39;d just<br/>
heard about a raid that went sour when someone trained the giants into<br/>
nagafen&#39;s room and wiped out the people fighting naggy). I wanted the 53+<br/>
folks to not only clear a path, but to set up guard points along the way to<br/>
kill any respawners so it was clear for the folks 52 and under. Then the<br/>
high lvls would guard outside the door to make sure no trains got through to<br/>
naggy&#39;s room. Anyways, someone started saying that high lvls couldn&#39;t fight<br/>
naggy it was against the rules and stuff. an argument ensued in /ooc over<br/>
how we were talking about the highers fighting the giants, not Naggy. (I<br/>
didn&#39;t argue, I just said what my plan was and what the limit cap was for<br/>
attacking naggy). Someone else started saying there were schedules for the<br/>
raid and that you had to sort of make reservations. I&#39;ve never heard of such<br/>
a thing before. If someone wants to go fight something or raid, they can do<br/>
it. So long as there is no KSing. My plan was to have everyone work together<br/>
anyways. The more the merrier. Only drawback would be lag. I wanted to have<br/>
a huge raid meeting beforehand to discuss strategy. who would guard where<br/>
and so forth. What do do in case one group got in trouble, who would help<br/>
that group and who would take the place of the group helping. A bunch of lvl<br/>
60s would be great for keeping zone clear. :-)<br/>
Anyhoo, I was referred to a website about raids on that server that I will<br/>
check out later. If anyone has any ideas, let me know. :-)<br/>
This is all on The Tribunal but the plan could work on any server. So long<br/>
as nobody above 52 draws aggro from naggy, its all good. :-)<br/>
luv,<br/>
