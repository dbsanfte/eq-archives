<div id="ygrps-yiv-21241317">Well congrats to you! :)<br/>
<br/>
However this doesn&#39;t work for everyone AND trying to get someone to PL <br/>
you is a whole nother adventure in itself! Another question I have for <br/>
you is what type of armor did you start out with? Were you twinked?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to rip on you or put you down for getting PL&#39;d but what I <br/>
am saying here is not everyone can go this route. You offer a great way <br/>
to do it but again not everyone can do this. Now with EQ2 out and all <br/>
the ubers moving over to it, you hardly ever find any on anymore and <br/>
those that are don&#39;t want to waste their time with a lowbie when the <br/>
camp they have been trying to get access to for the past 3 months to <br/>
finish their epic is now free. Plus not everyone has all the expans yet <br/>
and may not be able to get to some of those zones you mention. Not to <br/>
mention the time to play. Not everyone has 4 days they can play. I&#39;m <br/>
lucky I can get 1 full day half the time! Again I congradulate you on <br/>
your achievements.<br/>
<br/>
Now for those that are really that desperate (and stupid enough to give <br/>
full access to their account to a perfect stranger), you can try this <br/>
out! <br/>

&gt; Subject: power lvling 101<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the ends and out about power lvling is simple. get temp from a <br/>
&gt; cleric, get a druid. druid casts regn, str, damage shield, sow. goto <br/>
&gt; field of bone hit mob once move on, kill anything that walks away. <br/>
&gt; make sure druid is healing you. lvl 12 goto kurns tower ( off field <br/>
&gt; of bone ). kill in kurns tower to lvl 20 or intill something looks <br/>
&gt; green or light blue. goto paludal caverns lvl there the same way hit <br/>
&gt; mob once and move on. work your way to back tunnels and kill <br/>
&gt; shrinkens once there light  blue take the camps at zone in. from Here <br/>
&gt; you should be well on your way and zone choice can be done by you or <br/>
&gt; the druid.  Paw is mine it is getting nerfed soon.  I can lvl there <br/>
&gt; till late 35 or so. You could also goto into Crystal Caverns at 30 <br/>
&gt; for power lvling. Usualy by the time iam lvl 40 the druid is sick of <br/>
&gt; lvling me and i solo dawn shroud peak has zelnicks thay are cake for <br/>
&gt; a power lvled twinked player least it hasnt failed me. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for you who say spells spells spells. have powerlvled warrior, monk, <br/>
&gt; cleric, enchanter, rogue, all to lvl 40. then soloed 40-50 and my <br/>
&gt; skills where maxed from soloing. the coin you get plus the 5 points <br/>
&gt; each lvl you can easly bring skills up spells to comp you at lvl 40 <br/>
&gt; to get by. each class has a main spell class bring it and evocation <br/>
&gt; up.  and the rest come in short order. I have only seen one person <br/>
&gt; power lvled so hard he couldnt cast. But normaly you will work <br/>
&gt; something up it does take time. and your melee skills will be maxed, <br/>
&gt; if not close, my rogue i just started not only maxed pierceing but <br/>
&gt; 1hs as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  You may not want or like power lvling how ever i see nothing wrong <br/>
&gt; with pling to 40 soloing to 50 before i begain my grouping career. <br/>
&gt; todayes game has drop gear cheap to make an old school 65 war on a 40 <br/>
&gt; war. so grping with people at lvls below 55 are slaying the mobs. its <br/>
&gt; not like it was when the game came out, and grps realy did need <br/>
&gt; players below 55 to play well. even my rouge can tank still at 46. <br/>
&gt; dont sweat lvl 70 because you not going to get there in a day. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     lvl 46 rogue in 4 days played less than two weeks. </span></blockquote></div>
