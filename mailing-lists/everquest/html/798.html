in other peoples stuff! Is &#39;inspect&#39; a totally<br/>
accepted thing, or is there some sort of<br/>
ettiquette that goes along with it? I don&#39;t mind<br/>
so much if I&#39;ve been chatting with someone for a<br/>
little while and they take a peek [it&#39;s not like<br/>
I have anything good to hide!] but when people<br/>
come right up to you, snoop, and then don&#39;t even<br/>
respond when you say &#39;Hail&#39; , I find that<br/>
extremely annoying. Any comments, guys?<br/>
