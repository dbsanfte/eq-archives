<div id="ygrps-yiv-280384904">Well I successfully managed to get  into EQ last night after what seemed<br/>
like forever to download the patch.<br/>
of course I waited till after I played for awhile before I DL the jaggedpine<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO  The new interface looks rather kewl.  one feature I liked when you<br/>
checked your skills it actually gives you the numerical values of your skill<br/>
level  on every skill you have  trained in and I mean EVERY skill not just<br/>
the ones you are rated master or above at.  Still trying to figure out the<br/>
new icons for the spells atm.  I like it that you can have separate chat<br/>
windows for your frequently used chats guild tells etc. helps keep stuff<br/>
separate a lot better when you are in a battle or have more than one<br/>
conversation going at the same time  one thing I miss from the old UI is the<br/>
face changing ability. hehe there are times when I would like to change my<br/>
face around just for the heck of it but if I really wanna do that I guess I<br/>
could always go back to the old UI for that.  Just wonder if I would have to<br/>
redo all my  NewUI settings when I go back..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for JaggedPine I&#39;ve not traveled there yet.  I was at the Bazaar just<br/>
before I logged and there were 238 peeps there when I went ld when my<br/>
Antivirus  autoscan kicked in at 5am EST this morning LOL.  I was so caught<br/>
up in playing EQ I completely forgot to disable the task LOL<br/>

&gt;  Hey,  I was just wondering what everybody&#39;s thoughts on the new UI are.<br/>
I really like it,  except the new spell icons,  it will take a while to get<br/>
used to those.  Everything else is pretty cool.  It is really nice being<br/>
able to create multiple chat windows so you can get rid of battle spam &<br/>
such & you don&#39;t miss the important things =D<br/>
