<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049803883">I&#39;m a girl, and my character looks darned good if I say so myself ;o) <br/>
My sister plays (Immerzenla), my daughter (Megganeggin) and my <br/>
neighbor&#39;s daughter (Daffny).<br/>
<br/>
Question: I had a marriage proposal from a Barbarian Warrior when I <br/>
was last in North Qeynos in the newbie area. What&#39;s that all about? <br/>
Do characters get married in-game? Also, I had someone ask if I <br/>
wanted to go to Crow&#39;s for a fish sandwich, and someone asked if I <br/>
wanted to go to the Lion&#39;s Mane for an ale. I get more propositions <br/>
in-game then in real-life! Dang, that&#39;s sad isn&#39;t it hahahahhhaha!<br/>
