<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-112935735">I have a 1.4Ghz AMD Athlon, 1Gb DDR RAM, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128mb vid card,<br/>
Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card, Altec Lansing 4.1 speakers, 17 inch<br/>
KDS flat tube monitor, HP digital mouse, Micro Innovations ergonomic<br/>
keyboard, Zoom v92 kflex 56k modem (for backup dialup when satellite<br/>
transmitter stops working) and some kind of satellite modem via USB port.<br/>
Oh, and I have a cool psuedo leather chair that glides back and forth,<br/>
swivels, and reclines. It has pockets on the sides to store stuff in. For<br/>
those loooong camps I lean back, put my feet up on the foot rest and relax.<br/>
My desk is shit though.<br/>
luv,<br/>

version of EQ on it, but I was more curious as to everyone&#39;s computers.</div>
