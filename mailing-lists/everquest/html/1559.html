<div id="ygrps-yiv-3865481">I have a Geforce 2 Ultra and it shot craps on me today. After talking to<br/>
tech support to determine that the card is indeed dead, and finding out that<br/>
I won&#39;t get the warranty replacement until Monday at the earliest via FedEx<br/>
(it is Thursday night/Friday morning now), I resurrected my old VooDoo 3<br/>
3000 out of its resting place in the bottom desk drawer and installed it in<br/>
my PC. After going to www.3dfx.com and downloading the latest drivers and<br/>
installing them, I had 3 hours of flawless EQ action in Lake of Ill Omen,<br/>
one of the laggiest zones in the game (DING 25!).<br/>
.<br/>
If you ask me (yeah, I know, you didn&#39;t ask me, but oh well), I think the<br/>
Voodoo 3 looks better than the Geforce 2 Ultra. Maybe it doesn&#39;t _perform_<br/>
better -- I know the specs are far inferior -- but the images on the monitor<br/>
sure look better, and EQ behaved better.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; with a voodoo3 3000?<br/>
&gt; I have spent hours in tech support trying to get this ressolved but kept<br/>
&gt; getting booted out to server select or desktop while waiting my turn and<br/>
&gt; losing my place in line..<br/>
&gt; My computer screen freezes up at random during eq. I took all of the<br/>
advice<br/>
&gt; suggested to remedy the situation. I even tested the card in another<br/>
&gt; computer and it had the same problem.<br/>
&gt; Anyone else have a voodoo3 3000?<br/>
&gt; luv, </span></blockquote></div>
