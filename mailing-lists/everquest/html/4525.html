<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078135573">I&#39;m on a k6-3 450, 448 megs...more ram does help, and turn your texture<br/>
caching on! It may slow down initial loads a bit, and every time you enter a<br/>
new zone for the first time (overall, not per session) it makes the cache<br/>
file, but once your files are made, it REALLY speeds things up. I zone much<br/>
more quicker than I used to, in most cases. I also rarely get dropped<br/>
zoning, unless the server is already iffy. Also, since you have loads of<br/>
room....set your VM manually. 2x real ram + 50 megs in 9x/ME, 4x + 50 in 2k<br/>
or XP, both min and max. I tend to get around a 10-12% boost with this<br/>
tweak. Last but not least...get a better vid card.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Slow load and zoning<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello - just joined this group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son is very a very enthusiastic EQ player, but is constantly<br/>
&gt; frustrated by the initial loading times (about 10 minutes) and in<br/>
&gt; particular time to go from one zone to the next - about five minutes<br/>
&gt; on average. Very often it crashes back to the server screen after a<br/>
&gt; long wait.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The PC is a PII 450 with 384Mb RAM and a 60GB hard disk, 90% of which<br/>
&gt; is free. The graphics card is a 16MB nVidia Riva TNT. Internet<br/>
&gt; connection is a fast 512Kbs ADSL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is this normal with EQ, and if not, how long should it take to load<br/>
&gt; and zone? What can be done to really speed things up?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
