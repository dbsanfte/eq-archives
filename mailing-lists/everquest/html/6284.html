<div id="ygrps-yiv-840906198">I agree with Wulfric. one thing to keep in mind though. Your old account <br/>
may still be there. I was OOG for about 2 years and was sure my toons <br/>
were wiped out but when I paid my dues and logged in I was pleasantly <br/>
suprised to see my beautiful Rangerette still there! I too only had EQ <br/>
and the Kunark expan but I decided to get the Platinum pack simply <br/>
because if I went and bought all the expansions seperately it would have <br/>
cost me well over $150! The Platinum pack was only $30 (at a local <br/>
Wal*Mart) which gave me EQ, Kunark, Scars, PoP, LoY, and LDoN plus I got <br/>
a cool little freebie, 10 mana and health potions that are usuable with <br/>
the new Potion belt feature. I also picked up the DoN expansion as well <br/>
simply for the guild management options. Currently there are two other <br/>
expansions I don&#39;t have which are Omens of War and the new one &quot;Depths <br/>
of Darkhollow&quot; (which I don&#39;t think is even available quite yet.) but <br/>
then again, my highest toon is only 45 so OoW won&#39;t do me any good.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to get all the expans but only a couple then I highly <br/>
suggest PoP and LDoN. LDoNs are a real blast. curerently my guild is <br/>
doing them every other weekend just for fun and for all of us to get <br/>
together (Well, what few of us there are) and do something as a guild.<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps!<br/>

&gt;Three years ago I played using the Kunark and Luclin expansions. If I<br/>
&gt;were to invest the ~$15 per month to start playing again would it be<br/>
&gt;enjoyable if those were the only two expansions I played with?<br/>

&gt;Undoubtedly no.  There has been so many changes to the game since those two expansions that  you&#39;d invariably have a very difficult time trying to level and get better gear.  Sure you could still find places to level, but it would take you longer and you&#39;d be missing out on A LOT of great enhancements.  I&#39;d highly reccomend if you&#39;re gonna get back into it to spend $30 and buy whatever bundle pack is available with all the expansions.   Since Luclin there has been Planes of Power, Legacy of Ykesha, Lost Dungeons of Norrath, Omens of War, Dragons of Norrath, and a 9th one which I am forgetting.   I really think each expansion definitely offers something that makes the expansion worth getting.  So good luck in whatever you decide to do.<br/>
