<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121900689">It says &quot;your will is not sufficient to command this weapon&quot; and it means<br/>
you are not high enough level for your weapon to &quot;cast&quot; its particular<br/>
proc(ess).<br/>
<br/>
If the mace you happen to be wielding is a Screaming Mace, it begins<br/>
proccing when you reach level 10, and the proc is a temporary increase in<br/>
strength similar to the cleric spell Yaulp.<br/>
<br/>
Not too bad of a weapon at lower levels.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] What does this mean????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi again everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yesterday I was playing Genmay, my Gnome Warrior and I&#39;m using a<br/>
&gt; mace as my weapon. I kept getting a message saying something like my<br/>
&gt; will isn&#39;t right to command this weapon. What does that mean? That I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not able to use it or more specifically my class doesn&#39;t wield this<br/>
&gt; weapon as well as others? Heck I seemed to be kicking some butt with it<br/>
&gt; as my hits were ranking between 12-16 points each. Any ideas?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
