&gt; Yep...it sure is easy to build up trust.  Just make friends, just like you<br/>
&gt; would elsewhere.  Pkers generally don&#39;t try to make friends and hang out<br/>
&gt; w/<br/>
&gt; you.  They just rush up when you&#39;re weak or obviously much lower level<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They can&#39;t get anything in bags.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They can take things you are wearing, but it&#39;s only 1 random item..so if<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t want to lose something cool, bag it b4 u die.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Guards will protect you if you&#39;re right next to them, but don&#39;t attack.<br/>
&gt; Let them hit you, and the guard will step in.  However, they won&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; anything about you getting casted on or shot w/ a bow from a distance.<br/>
