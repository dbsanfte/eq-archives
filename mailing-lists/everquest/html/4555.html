<div id="ygrps-yiv-982101234">Does anyone know what this is for? I checked the Allhakazam site and <br/>
the Caster&#39;s Realm and don&#39;t see anything. I got it off a bandit in <br/>
West Karana.<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone know of any newbie quests, or any quests in general <br/>
that are geared towards a Erudite Enchanter? I see quests for all <br/>
other class/races/dieties, but only 2 epic quest for level 65 Erudite <br/>
Enchanters. I ran around for 2 months killing every black and shadow <br/>
wolf in East Commonlands and West/North/South Karana to complete an <br/>
Arcan Order Glove quest, only to find out that it was for a Human <br/>
Enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
I keep getting cool no-drop items (bandit sashes, bandit teeth, <br/>
lion&#39;s tail, Kliknick bile sacs, etc.) that are used in quests, but I <br/>
can&#39;t use them :( This kinda sucks.</div>
