&gt;<br/>
&gt; Greetings friends, a couple of friends and I are creating a new<br/>
&gt; EverQuest site dedicated to helping newbie and for people to have<br/>
&gt; somewhere to go where you can easily access maps or guides for every<br/>
&gt; class and zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am looking for writers and anything else (read below) to help out with<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; this page<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would REALLY appreciate anyone interested to send me an editorial,<br/>
&gt; article, comic strip, artwork, essay, maps, drawing or anything having<br/>
&gt; to do with EQ<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Drop me a line at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:azdrain@...">azdrain@...</a> or ICQ 1714044 if you are interested<br/>
&gt; If you play on the Ralloz Zek or Xegony server I&#39;m sure I could give you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; some nice items or cash in game for your time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanx<br/>
&gt; Banez<br/>
