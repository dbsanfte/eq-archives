<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] New to online Gaming <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-16003608"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; Having been a fan of computer RPG&#39;s for years I am considering trying<br/>
&gt; EQ. Having never played an online rpg before I have a few questions ?<br/>
&gt; (Forgive my lack of knowledge and feel free to laugh at my questions)<br/>
&gt; 1. Being used to playing solo games I could pretty much play at my<br/>
&gt; own pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other online players but<br/>
&gt; seeing as I am a casual gamer i only spend  10-15 hours a week gaming<br/>
&gt; is this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play occurs with whoever<br/>
&gt; is online at the time and am I not tied into a specific group/times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi! Yeah, Everquest is flexible. You can play however long or short you<br/>
want. There are different hunting grounds with different paces. you can try<br/>
to level up quickly, or you can explore and meet the npcs and so forth. It&#39;s<br/>
pretty neat.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join with?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s fairly easy. Depends on what time you get on. Some times have more<br/>
players than others. Generally at level 1 you can solo if you&#39;re careful.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kunak, etc) does it<br/>
&gt; matter which one I start with or are the later addons geared for<br/>
&gt; higher level characters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kunark is an expansion. You have to have the original to play it. It has one<br/>
starting race. For other races it is a higher level area. I recommend either<br/>
starting in the original world or in the new expansion of Luclin.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the system requirements<br/>
&gt; but what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866, 128sdram, 32mb ddr nvidia<br/>
&gt; geforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or should I wait<br/>
&gt; till I upgrade.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe that would work. I was able to play the original EQ on a less<br/>
sophisticated machine. You will have to cut down on character models though<br/>
so you won&#39;t be able to enjoy as much of the graphics. The game will give<br/>
you recommendations on how many character models you should have switched<br/>
on. Even though I have a 1.4Ghz AMD Athlon, 1Gb of RAM, 64mb Nvidia GeForce<br/>
2 MX, and Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card, I only use a few of the<br/>
models because my internet connection is only 21k.<br/>
I recommend that you try a trial version of EverQuest (you can contact their<br/>
marketting department at their website I believe) to find out how to get<br/>
one. If your system has problems with the trial, you may want to wait to<br/>
upgrade. If you are planning to upgrade you may want to use pricegrabber.com<br/>
to search for parts. Also, computershopper.com has reviews on the products<br/>
and which ones are best. The better the video card the better the framerate<br/>
you will get.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any feedback<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My pleasure. I hope you join the world of EverQuest soon. I&#39;d love to see<br/>
you on The Tribunal server sometime.<br/>
luv,<br/>
