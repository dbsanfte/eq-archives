<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979150900">My lil brothers familiar runs off all the time. We were in kael once. he was<br/>
in arena and I was at the zoneline and his damn familiar wouldn&#39;t leave me<br/>
alone. It just kept following me everywhere. We weren&#39;t even grouped at the<br/>
time. Those things have a mind of their own. And I think it knew I was<br/>
Bartok&#39;s sister and came to annoy me.. who say&#39;s pet&#39;s dont take after their<br/>
owners LOL<br/>

&gt; Familiar is a wizard&#39;s pet. It can&#39;t fight, it&#39;s more like a visible<br/>
&gt; buff.<br/>
&gt; You have to resummon it each time you die, but it zones with you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; [Steven R. Hulse] Is this a new thing? I used to have a wiz at one point<br/>
&gt; but it never had this spell until like a higher level. Hmm, cool. You<br/>
&gt; know, I think I may have met you the other night, Someone, (I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; remember their name now), was talking with their pet, It was kind of<br/>
&gt; funny at first I didn&#39;t realize it was their pet and thought it was<br/>
&gt; another person! ;-) It was at the Orc lift in Felwith.<br/>

&gt; LOL I call mine Flappy too and feed him treats, emote him purring, biting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ppl who are snotty to me, etc. It&#39;s at least a cool idea...and really, a<br/>
actual pet of any sort would make a wiz overpowered if you think about it.<br/>
I&#39;m content with my lil guy, even if he is just a visible buff.<br/>

&gt;   [Steven R. Hulse] Well that kind of sucks! I mean thanks for the info<br/>
&gt;   but if they can&#39;t fight then what good are they? I guess it&#39;s cool to<br/>
&gt;   have it follow you around and stuff. Oh well, I didn&#39;t design the game.<br/>
&gt;   ;-)<br/>

&gt;   It&#39;s also the first spell of that type a wizard gets so it fizzles a<br/>
&gt;   LOT. My<br/>
&gt;   wizard spent a good 3 hours medding and fizzling just trying to get her<br/>
&gt;   familiar back. I&#39;ve never noticed any change in my fizzles or anything<br/>
&gt;   after<br/>
&gt;   a successful summoning. And sometimes it runs off and I can&#39;t find it.<br/>
&gt;   But<br/>
&gt;   it&#39;s fun to have it just following around and flapping it&#39;s little<br/>
