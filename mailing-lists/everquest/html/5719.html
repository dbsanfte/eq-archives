<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003400526">I know Warriors can learn special combat abilities now.  Maybe I am <br/>
not doing it right but I have note been able to find a website that <br/>
lists them and tells how to use them.  Looked at the EQ Manual online <br/>
and it has nothing that I could find.  Anyone know of a resource?</div>
