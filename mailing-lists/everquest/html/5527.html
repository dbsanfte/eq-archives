gear for 3 months. However, in practice they have never yet actually<br/>
wiped any characters over level one (I think they did a wipe of<br/>
unplayed level ones a couple of years ago, or intended to). I know<br/>
people who have cancelled their account and then returned 2-3 years<br/>
later and their characters are still their with all their gear.<br/>
