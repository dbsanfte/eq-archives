<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Funny you should mention that - When I was setting 
out on the second part - from Rivervale to Freeport, some guy stopped me just 
before I entered Kithicor because it was 1am, he told me to wait till morning, 
so i did.&nbsp; He he, after how far i&#39;d come it would have been very annoying 
to get killed there.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;btw - Ralwen made it to Kelethin so say hi if 
you&#39;re in the neighbourhood - most peopole there don&#39;t believe that a lv6 could 
foot it alone from Qeynos, even with the assist through highpass, tho to be 
honest, with Selo&#39;s most of the zones were easy, especially once i got to the 
Commons.</font></div>

  &nbsp;Maybe the stupidest thing I do often is running through Kithicor at any 
  time of the night. &nbsp;I just get a sow and run up on the side of the hill 
  as fast as I can and never look back. &nbsp;So far, I&#39;ve been lucky and I&#39;ve 
  been doing this since my mid teen levels. &nbsp;Have a friend who says I&#39;m 
  crazy and I should wait until day. <br><br>Lesamlam <br>40th Enchanter
