<div>it&#39;s getting so pitiful with some wars when&nbsp;I&#39;m playing my chanter i stand right next to them to cast at least that way they don&#39;t have to chase the mob to taunt it all they have to do is turn a little, and as I&#39;m usually grouped with guildies the healer already has me on target when they pull.... and it&#39;s getting so&nbsp;I&#39;ll only group in BoT when&nbsp;I&#39;m on my beast&nbsp;with a healer i know cause&nbsp;half the time&nbsp;if I&#39;m using Sha&#39;s Revenge I&#39;m going to get my behind kicked till the tank can get it off me.

<div>&nbsp;</div><tt>I was in a group in PoV one day when the tank could not keep aggro off of anyone. I don&#39;t know why, I guess his dps wasn&#39;t that good. The shaman was ready to leave bc he kept getting aggro and the tank had a hard time taunting off of him for some reason. So I decided to protect the shammy and as soon as the shammy slowed I would stun the mob and run up within melee range and start bashing the hell out of it. I was actually better at getting aggro than the tank. lol. I&#39;ve had to do that for chanters too. So long as I can take the hits it&#39;s ok.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>======== At 2004-12-20, 14:00:00 you wrote: ========<br><br>Gotta agree with ya there Su.&nbsp; With my lvl 67 Shammy i find that my slows tend to pull agro away from the tank and&nbsp; i have to automatically start melee as soon as the mob gets close to me&nbsp; until the Tank can steal agro back until i cast my DoT on em and regain agro again lol.&nbsp; I have learned as well to not run away either cause that brief moment when you turn away could get ya killed a lot faster&nbsp; if you don&#39;t just stand there melee back and hope yer healer (druid/Shaman/ Cleric/ or even Ranger) can get a heal off on ya before too long.&nbsp; Prim example was last night in Harbingers and I wound up getting the agro form a Named and wound up melee cause we had a crap load of ads and even with my AoE slow i still managed to not only get the named but the adds at the same time .&nbsp; Luckily I had my Shammy 1.5 in hand and clicked it to help keep me alive till The cleric could get a heal off on me and the rest of the melee could draw the adds and such away form this almost dead shimmy =)<br><br>Halyburton (the Recently Sol Ro flagged)<br>67 Barb Shammy<br>1.0/1.5 Enabled<br>Legion of Vengeance<br>Saryrn<br></tt></td></tr>
