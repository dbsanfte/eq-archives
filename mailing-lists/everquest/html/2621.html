<b>Subject:</b> Re: How do you camp items and spawns? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-785434144">Well, how do you camp?  Be prepared for long and boring waits my <br/>
friend.  If you are camping a rare spawn that&#39;s all you can do.  You <br/>
are usually focused on a certain item for a certain quest, so that&#39;s <br/>
what keeps your interest up.  This is where friends or guildies help, <br/>
as you know they will ask for your help on their boring camp.  I&#39;m in <br/>
the midst of the Ivy Etched Armor quests and I have several camps <br/>
ahead.  One guy is an 8 hour pop, if he pop&#39;s!  My buddies gladly <br/>
come along, and there&#39;s usually a few people around to chat with.  <br/>
And there&#39;s always gems!<br/>
<br/>
So, I would say look at what you need for what you want, and plan for <br/>
it.  Many guilds take in new members in your level range, join up and <br/>
tell them what you want to do.  Odds are there will many people <br/>
willing to help you, as long as you help them.</div>
